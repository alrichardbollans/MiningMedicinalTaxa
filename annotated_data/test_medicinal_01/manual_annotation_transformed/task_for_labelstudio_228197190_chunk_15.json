      "text": "For this reason there were only twenty questions split into four sections, estimated to be completed within 10-15 minutes. The first section set out to explore participants' personal use of HMs: looking into the traditional use of HMs amongst families and cultural backgrounds, and HCPs knowledge of HMs for specific ailments. The second section focused on patients' use of HMs, whereby HCPs experience of adverse effects and interactions caused by HMs were investigated. The third section looked at the HCPs' professional opinions of THM; exploring their perceptions of safety and efficacy of HMs, and opinions on the level of education on alternative therapies during their professional training. The final section was designed to evaluate the population demographics, exploring ethnic origins, gender, and occupations. 3.5.2 Participant Inclusion Criteria The definition of a HCP was explored in section 3.4.1 (p84). After considering the definitions of a HCP and receiving feedback from the De Montfort University (DMU) Ethics committee (Appendix 2A) it was concluded that the term healthcare professionals (HCPs) would be used to refer to those who currently have or previously had interactions with patients dealing with any aspect of patient care. This could include: doctors, consultants, surgeons, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, and physiotherapists, herbal medicine practitioners, etc. 97 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The principal requirement for the participant inclusion criteria was that participants had to be a HCP from the UK or having some experience of working in the UK; this was so the results could be generalised to UK HCPs. Undergraduate students currently completing degrees or courses were not directly invited to participate, if the students had training placements or contact with patients their responses were used for the analysis (e.g. pre-registration pharmacists or optometrists or students with clinical placements). There were no other defined parameters for the research sample (i.e. gender, age, or occupation), as this was an exploratory survey to investigate the general perceptions of HCPs on HMs. 3.5.3 Distribution of the Questionnaire Initially, it was intended that the questionnaire would be posted to HCPs, mainly doctors' surgeries and pharmacies around Birmingham and Leicester (the same cities where the SATMED questionnaires were conducted). However, this raised some doubt about the ethical approval required to send questionnaires to doctors who were contracted with the NHS (see section 3.5.4, p98). Also, the cost of printing and posting the questionnaires, the time consuming process, and low response rate associated with postal questionnaires were outweighing the benefits of conducting the research. The concept of using SurveyMonkey (an online survey software) and distributing it via social media was discussed amongst the research team and was considered to be a better alternative; as it avoided the cost of printing and posting the questionnaires. As the questionnaire was published online, distribution was not limited to two cities (Birmingham and Leicester); instead participants from across the UK were able to complete the survey. It was anticipated to be a quicker and easier way of distributing the survey to the target audience. The survey was available online for one year from 12th May 2014 -12th May 2015; this gave participants the freedom to complete the survey at their own leisure. The link to the online survey was emailed to friends and colleagues by the research team, participants were then asked to forward the email to other HCPs they knew. The link was circulated around Lloyds Pharmacy stores around the West Midlands with the approval of the area and regional managers. In addition, it was posted onto the researchers' personal Facebook and Twitter accounts, where friends who were HCPs were asked to complete the survey and share the link on their own profiles too. The link was re-tweeted (shared) by various HCPs and organisations on Twitter including The Guardian Healthcare. The distribution method used led to a snowball sampling technique being adopted as the survey was passed on from person to person. 98 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.5.4 The Ethical Debate To satisfy the De Montfort University (DMU) ethical guidelines, any changes to the original PhD proposal which required ethical approval needed to be declared to the DMU ethics committee and approved before the amendments were imposed. An amendment form was completed and submitted for review (Appendix 2A). The ethics committee highlighted several points which needed to be addressed (Appendix 2B). The main concern was the requirement of the National Health Service Research and Development (NHS R&D) approval for the study as it was going to explore the views of HCPs who worked for the NHS. Contact was made with the NHS R&D team at Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), who initially said the University ethical approval was sufficient for the online distribution of the questionnaires. If the questionnaires were to be posted to doctors surgeries then approval from local CCGs would need to be obtained. The ethical approval for the project was debated amongst the Leicester CCG as there were no guidelines for online surveys with HCPs. Governance Arrangements for Research Ethics Committees (GAfREC), published by the UK Health Departments in May 2011 states, \"Research Ethics Committee (REC) review is not normally required for research involving NHS or social care staff recruited as research participants by virtue of their professional role,\" (NHS Health Research Authority, n.d.). As the online surveys were to be completed by HCPs in their personal time some said NHS ethical approval was not required. Several correspondences later it was decided that the NHS R&D and Site Specific Information (SSI) forms needed to be completed via the Integrated Research Application System (IRAS) as the team at the Leicester CCG were collectively unsure about how to treat online surveys. SSI forms detail what activities will happen in precise locations and separate forms are required for each CCG; however, as the survey was distributed online the locality of the HCPs could not be forecasted. Despite this it was agreed to complete the process to ensure the study was conducted ethically. The time consuming application process was completed and ethical approval for the study was granted by the Leicester City CCG which provides the Primary Care R&D Service across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland (Appendix 2C). Beninger et al. (2014) identifies the difficulties of applying traditional ethical principles to newly developing methods such as online and social media research. Due to the limited guidance available it proved to be a challenge; but one where valuable lessons were learnt. 99 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.5.5 Anonymity and Confidentiality As no personal identifiable data was obtained participants anonymity was ensured throughout the process. The demographic data obtained at the end of the questionnaire was designed to evaluate the types of HCPs who were completing the questionnaire, their age, place of birth and ethnic background. No personal contact details were taken and there was no way of tracing where responses had come from. The survey was designed and published online via SurveyMonkey. It was a password protected website which only the primary researcher had access to, ensuring all responses were kept confidential. By having all the data password protected the researcher ensured there was no unauthorised access. 3.5.6 Analysis of the Questionnaires The SurveyMonkey software created graphs for quantitative questions, and enabled the results to be exported; summarising them into a portable document format (pdf) or PowerPoint presentation. Although this software enabled the data to be summarised it did not allow cross comparisons or correlations to be made. For this reason the results were then manually imported into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 21), where they were analysed. 100 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.6 Results and Discussion A total of 112 respondents attempted the questionnaire, of which 93 were completed. Of the total number of participants who started the questionnaire, 19 withdrew at different stages; 11 participants stopped after question 3, 3 participants left after question 4, 1 stopped after question 9, and the other 3 participants left out the 'about you' section. It was contemplated to discard the incomplete surveys; however, this would mean losing some valuable data. For this reason all responses were included in the analysis and the number (n) of respondents for each question has been highlighted. 3.6.1 Sample Description The 'about you' section of the questionnaire was designed to get some background information about the research participants. As 19 participants withdrew by this stage of the survey, these results are from the 93 participants who completed the entire questionnaire. Age and Gender Profiles Figure 3-1 summarises the age and gender profile of the research sample: 57% (n=53) were female and 43% (n=40) were male participants. Most of the participants (n=33) were in the 21-30 years age group; nevertheless, there was a range of participants representing the other age groups too. The two participants in the '20 years or under' age group where both optometry students who had clinical placements; thus, their responses were included in this analysis. 051015202520 years orunder21-30 years 31-40 years 41-50 years 51-60 years 61+ yearsAge rangeNumber of participantsAge and Gender of ParticipantsMaleFemaleFigure 3-1 Healthcare Professionals' Age and Gender Profiles 101 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Ethnic Origins The two main ethnic groups participants identified with were White-British (39%, n=36) and Asian/ Asian British-Indian (38%, n=35). Figure 3-2 identifies the proportion of participants from each ethnic background. The 7% (n=6) of participants who selected other claimed to be White-Italian, White-American, White-other, White-mixed, mixed White-British with Black-Caribbean, and Turkish. Figure 3-2 Healthcare Professionals' Ethnic Origins Birthplace & Religion The majority of participants (81%, n=75) were born in the UK, 8% (n=7) were born in India, 5% (n=5) in Africa and the remaining 6% (n=6) who selected 'other' said they were born in Albania, Australia, Ireland, Poland, or the USA. Some religions have a strong affiliation with HMs; for example black seed (Nigella sativa L.) is claimed to be the cure for all diseases but death according to Islamic beliefs (Ansari and Satish, 2013), while Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) represents a goddess in Hinduism (Miller and Miller, 2003). There was a range of participants from each of the religious options presented; 25% Christian, 20% Hindu, 11% Sikh, 10% Muslim, 4% other (other religions listed included Buddhist, Jain, Jewish, and Humanist), while 30% (n=28) of participants claimed to have 'No Religion'. Participants were asked about their birthplace and religion to see if any correlation between their knowledge and use of THM was influenced by their background (this will be explored later in the results section). 39%4%5%1%38%5%1%7%Participants' EthnicityWhite: BritishWhite: IrishBlack/ Black British: AfricanBlack/ Black British: CaribbeanAsian/ Asian British: IndianAsian/ Asian British: PakistaniAsian/ Asian British: BangladeshiOther102 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Highest Qualification There was a vast array of qualification listed by participants, including: GCSEs, A-Levels, diploma, bachelor's degree, postgraduate/ clinical diplomas, Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS), Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS), Doctor of Medicine (MD), Masters, Master of Science (MSc), Master of Philosophy (MPhil), Master of Pharmacy (MPharm), Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (MRCPsych), Bachelor of Medicine and/or Surgery (MBBS), Member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (MRCOG), Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners MRCGP, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and post-doctorate (All Acronyms, 2015). A large number of participants (46%, n=43) had a Masters Level or equivalent qualification (Figure 3-3). Several pharmacists who had either an MPharm or bachelor's degree in pharmacy stated their highest level of qualification was their post-graduate/clinical diplomas. Two participants selected the 'other' option, of which one stated 'professional' and the other 'Fellow of the Society of Biology.' The high level of qualifications participants have reflects the types of jobs they have, and the range of HCPs who completed this survey. Figure 3-3 Healthcare Professionals' Qualifications Job Role: Over 42 different occupations were listed by participants. Table 3-1 outlines the different job roles participants stated. It would not have been possible to recruit the variety of HCPs if traditional research methods such as postal questionnaires were used. If the surveys were posted to pharmacies and GP surgeries the responses would have been limited to community pharmacists, general practitioners, and practice nurses. Due to the survey being published online, it was easier to forward the link to a diverse range of HCPs. 0 10 20 30 40 50OtherPhD/Doctorate or equivalentMasters or equivalentPost-graduate diplomaDegree or equivalentDiplomaA-LevelsGCSEsNumber of ParticipantsSummary of Qualifications 103 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 3-1 Summary of Healthcare Professionals' Occupations Key: (n = the number of participants identified under each profession). Do you currently work/ have worked in the UK? This question was added due to concerns over the survey spreading internationally on social media, as the link was being rapidly circulated. Although the introductory paragraph before starting the questionnaire clearly stated 'for UK healthcare professionals' there was a risk of respondents not acknowledging this. As this question was added at a later date just 20 (22%) participants who completed the surveys responded; all of whom did confirm they currently did or had worked in the UK.

Question 1: Is traditional herbal medicine part of your family/ cultural background? Of the total population who completed this question 45% (n=50) said HMs were part of their family/ cultural background; while, 55% (n=62) said it was not. The demographics of the participants indicated they were from a range of ethnic backgrounds, religions, and countries. A comparison of participants' ethnic origins and whether or not they said HMs were part of their family/cultural background revealed some interesting findings (Figure 3-4). More participants from the SA ethnicities (i.e. Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi backgrounds) claimed the use of HMs was part of their family and cultural background. Whereas, participants from Western cultures (i.e. White: British and Irish) stated HMs were not part of their family or cultural backgrounds. Figure 3-4 The Link Between Ethnicity and Traditional Remedies Being Part of Participants' Cultural Background. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used to see whether or not there was a statistically significant difference between ethnicity and the traditional use of HMs by participants' families. The Null hypothesis would be 'the traditional use of HMs is not linked with ethnicity'; while, the Alternative hypothesis would state 'the traditional use of HMs is associated with ethnicity.' If the significance (Sig) value is less than or equal to 0.05, there is a significant difference between the two variables (Pallant, 2007). The results from the 05101520253035Number of ParticipantsEthnicity Use of Traditional Herbal Remedies Amongst Different Ethnic Groups THR part of family/cultural backgroundTHR not part of family/cultural backgroundHMs part of fa ily/ cultural background HMs not part of family/ cultural background 105 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra ANOVA test gave a Sig value of 0.00 which is lower than 0.05 (Table 3-2); thus, a significant difference between the traditional use of HMs and ethnicity can be assumed. For this reason the null hypothesis can be rejected and the alternative hypothesis can be accepted, as a difference between the traditional use of HMs by families in different ethnic groups was statistically significant. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of THM is associated with ethnicity.

The Ipsos MORI report (2008) stated those educated to a degree level or above were generally more likely to use HMs. From the qualifications listed by this research population it is clear participants were highly educated, 68% of participants had qualifications higher than a degree. Despite this, a large proportion of participants (62%, n=70) said they did not use any HMs for their own health. The 38% (n=42) of participants who did claim to use plants, herbs, or spices for their health listed a range of different products (Table 3-3)."
