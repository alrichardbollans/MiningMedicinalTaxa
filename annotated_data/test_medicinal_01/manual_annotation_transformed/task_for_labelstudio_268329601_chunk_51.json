Some years ago, the WisconsinAlumni Research Foundation discovered that amodified form of coumarin made a very effective ratpoison. They named it Warfarin (after themselves).The poor little rats go off someplace and die frominternal hemorrhaging. ORDEAL POISONSThe lives of many peoples through the ages have beendominated by a complex pantheon of deities, bothgood and evil. In many societies, one very importantobligation was to placate friendly gods and not toencourage the evil ones. These were not societies thatwere protected by a single omnipotent god whorewarded good deeds and punished the wicked. Inmany societies, the people developed procedures fordetermining guilt and innocence. This was a trial or anordeal to which suspects were subjected. If innocent,the person would be able to pass the ordeal; but, ifguilty, he or she would fail.We have used similar devices in the United States andEurope. Consider the witch trials of the 17th century.A woman suspected of being a witch was bound,placed in a bag, and tossed in a lake. If she floated, itwas concluded that she was indeed a witch and shewas dispatched in some novel fashion. If the womansank to the bottom of the lake and drowned, hersurvivors had the consolation of knowing that she wasinnocent.Many of the African tribes employed plant poisons intheir own version of the ordeal. No one really knowshow the use of ordeal poisons began. One plausibleexplanation is that food gatherers mistakenly pickeda toxic plant, assuming it to be edible. The people ofthe village ate it; some were poisoned and died, whileothers lived. Given the philosophical and religiousclimate, a possible explanation that would come tomind is that those who ate the plant and died weresomehow connected with witchcraft or were guilty ofsome evil and were being punished.There are several different ways in which the ordealpoisons were employed. One of the moststraightforward involves a plant called the tanghin ofMadagascar (Cerbera spp.) All parts of this tree aretoxic, the fruits especially so. The toxin is a cardiacglycoside. The person undergoing the ordeal is givena drink of rice water or rice soup. He or she is thengiven three pieces of chicken skin to swallow withoutchewing, followed by the crushed tanghin fruits mixedwith banana juice and a preparation of cardamomleaves or juice. Incantations are performed. Theconcoction acts as an emetic, a substance that willcause vomiting. Failure to do so is an immediate signof guilt. The vomitus is carefully examined by tribalofficials to see if all three pieces of chicken skin arepresent. They must be if the suspect is to be judgedinnocent. If not, the other members of the tribe killthe person, knowing now that he or she is guilty. Thesignificance of the chicken skin lies in the belief thatan evil spirit inhabits the body of a guilty person andthat it would devour any flesh presented to it,including chicken skin. Before considering this to be aquaint custom, consider that in 1830 a series ofnatural disasters and diseases swept Madagascar. Thisprompted mass ordeal trials to determine who wascausing these calamities. As many as 6000 peopledied in one trial!Probably the most famous of the ordeal poisonsinvolves the Calabar bean (Physostigma vene-nosum), a vine of the legume family named after atown in Nigeria. It has a long history of use in Africaas a means of identifying and killing witches. The trialconsisted of the accused drinking water that containedeight smashed Calabar beans. If the personregurgitated the beans or raised his right arm andsurvived, then he was judged innocent. The fast-acting toxin, physostigmine, rarely pro-duced thatresult.In recent years this plant has been the object ofmedical research. This same toxin is now used to treatglaucoma, chronic constipation, and aspects ofAlzheimer's disease.The \"Mauvi tree\" of East Africa is used by the nativesof the Lake Nyassa region. The bark is mixed withother substances and given to the suspects. If you areguilty, you will vomit and die. There is a certainsimplicity to it. The body of the guilty party is spiritedaway by relatives who will cremate the remains, grindup the bones, and put the powder on their faces.In some instances, the suspects at an ordeal will beasked to perform some task. Inability to do so is takenas a sign of guilt. In one tribe, the medicine mandraws a line on the ground about ten feet in front ofthe suspects. If you can walk across the line, you areinnocent. In another tribe, the suspect is asked to-174-jump over a stick held about 50 cm above the ground.One tribe that occupied what used to be called theIvory Coast in Africa used the white latex from amember of the spurge family. A latex-soaked piece ofcotton was placed under the eyelid and allowed toremain there for a required period. Damage to thecornea was taken as evidence of guilt.Many of the ordeal poisons were simple preparationsinvolving a toxic plant and one or two otheringredients. Some were complex preparation of aplant poison, lizards, crushed snakes, toads, heartsfrom previous victims, miscellaneous human organs,blood, and bile. The various ingredients were thenfermented for one year to bring them up to properstrength.The belief in the accuracy of the ordeal poisons was sopowerful that perfectly innocent people who weresubjected to the ritual would confess to the mosthorrible crimes if they felt the toxin taking effect. Aswith so many useful social institutions, corruptionsoon tainted the ordeal rituals. The priests and witchdoctors found that they could guarantee the outcomeof an ordeal by careful preparation of the poisons.Their friends received weak doses; their enemiesseldom survived. The witch doctor would make aconspicuous display of drinking a weak dose of theordeal poison before a large crowd to strengthen hisposition in the community and to show that theinnocent had nothing to fear.

MEDICINAL PLANTS10.1 - AN OVERVIEW' Medicinal plants act in two ways. Some actuallycure, while many others provide symptomaticrelief.' Our most famous medicinal plants are alsopoisonous ones. We have discovered how toadminister the toxin in controlled quantities toachieve the desired result.' The knowledge of indigenous people about thecurative powers of plants has been an importantsource of new drugs.' The power of the mind to effect cures and theplacebo effect are important factors in evaluatingthe medicinal properties of plants.' Even in this era of synthetics, we remaindependent upon the plant kingdom as a source ofmany critical medicines.' We are experiencing a renaissance of usingherbal medicines. It is a multi-billion dollar a yearindustry in the United States alone.' We are also experiencing concern about theeffectiveness of these herbal remedies, theirpurity, and how they interact with othermedications.' Exploration continues to find new cures fromplants.10.2 ! HISTORY\"And as there are discovered new Regions, newKingdoms, and new Provinces by our Spaniards, sothey have brought unto us newe Medicines, and neweRemedies, wherewith they do cure many informities,which, if we did lacke them, would bee incurible, andwithout any remedie...\" [Nicholas Monardes]\"Herbs ... are medical jewels gracing the woods, fieldsand lanes, which few eyes see, and few mindsunderstand.

Romeo and Juliet]\"El venemo de ayer es el medicamento de manana.\"[K. Mezey, 1946]\"The desire to take medicine is perhaps the greatestfeature which distinguishes man from animals. \"[Sir William Osler]WHAT IS AN HERB?The word has several meanings. As a general termused in botany, an herb is a non-woody plant. In thekitchen, an herb is a plant or plant part, such as dill ororegano, used to flavor food. What we are about toexamine are the medicinal herbs. Here the term, asdefined by Varro Tyler (1994) means \"... crude drugsof vegetable origin utilized for the treatment ofdisease states, often of a chronic nature, or to attainor maintain a condition of improved health.\" HISTORYA BRIEF HISTORY OF MEDICINE (SORT OF)BCE:2000 Here, eat this root!CE:1000 That root is heathen.

(After Nature: 21 October 2004)Perhaps no other aspect of economic botany is morefascinating than the study of medicinal plants. Wehave turned again and again to plants as sources ofmedicines to cure our diseases and disorders. In noother phase of ethnobotany do we find such a strangemixture of fact and fiction, sound medicine andfanciful tale.Anthropological and archeological studies suggest thatwe have been using plants for medicinal purposes forabout 60,000 years. This date is tied to fossilized plantremains at a Neanderthal grave site unearthed in Iran.Buried with the individual were yarrow, hollyhock,groundsel, grape-hyacinth, St. Barneby's thistle, andjoint-fir (Ephedra).Ancient texts reveal to us the materia medica, thebody of medical knowledge, possessed by variouscivilizations. Some of the more important ones are:Pen Tsao Ching, written by the Emperor Shen Nungin about 2700 BC, lists 365 drugs used in ancientChina.Code of Hammurabi, the Babylonian legal code ofabout 1770 BC, lists cassia, henbane, licorice, andmints.Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian text from 1500 BC lists700 drug plants and 876 formulas in use at the time.This 67 ft. long document was discovered by GeorgEbers in 1874 near Luxor. The papyrus cites hemp,opium, frankincense, myrrh, aloe, juniper, linseed,castor oil, fennel, cassia, senna, thyme, and henna.-176-De Materia Medica was written about AD 78 by theGreek physician Pedianos Dioskurides, better knownto us now as Dioscorides. It lists the medicinal uses of600 plants, including opium, ergot, black nightshade,and cinnamon. An illustrated version, the CodexJuliana, appeared in AD 512. De Materia Medicaremained an authoritative reference for 19 centuries!Physica is the only ancient herbal that I know ofwritten by a woman, Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179). It is also the first book on natural history donein Germany. Hildegard established a convent atRupertsberg and served there as Abbess until herdeath. She said that God had commanded her to writeher herbal.THE AGE OF HERBALS (1470 to 1670)An herbal is a compilation of plants used in a medicalcontext. Some had few, if any illustrations. Others hadcrude drawings; a few were lavishly illustrated.THE HERBALSDate Title AuthorBCE:2700 Pen Tsao Ching Emperor Shen Nung1500 Ebers Papyrus Egyptian priestsCE: 77 Historia Naturalis Pliny 78 De Materia Medica Pedianos Dioscorides1163 Physica Hildegard von Bingen1491 [H]ortus Sanitatis Jacobus Meyenbach1526 The Grete Herball Peter Treveris1539 New Kreuter Buch Jerome Bock1542 De Historia Stirpium Leonhart Fuchs1552 Badianus Manuscript Juan Badianus & de la Cruz1530 Herbarum Vivae Eicones Otto Brunfels1551 A New Herball William Turner1590 Pen Tsao Kang Mu Li Shih1597 Generall Historie of Plantes John Gerard1615 Rerum Medicarum Nova Hispaniae Francisco Hernandez1629 Paradisi in Sole ...

Acompilation of Aztec materia medica, it was the firstherbal of the New World. The only surviving copy wasdiscovered in the 1940's in the Vatican Library, whereit had been lost for more than four centuries. It listedabout 200 plants, along with an illustration and howthe plant was used. Pen Tsao Kang Mu was written in 1590 by Li Shih.This 52 volume catalogue of medicinal herbs contains1094 plants and about 11,000 recipes.The English Physician and Complete Herbal,published by Nicholas Culpeper in 1653, iscontaminated by his beliefs in astrology and alchemy.It remains popular even to this day, having gonethrough more than 100 editions.Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae (1615) waswritten by Francisco Hernandez (1514-1587),physician to King Philip II of Spain. It first appeared as16 folio volumes. An illustrated edition was publishedin 1651.New Herball was written by William Turner (1510-1568). Part 1 appeared in 1551; Pt. 2 in 1562.Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris (1629) waswritten by John Parkinson (1567-1650), apothecary toKing James I of England.Theatrum Botanicum: the Theater of Plantes, oran Universall and Compleate Herball (1640) wasthe other major contribution made by John Parkinson.The Herbal or Generall Historie of Plantes (1597)by John Gerard is perhaps the most monumentalclassical herbal in the English language. There may bemore printed copies in circulation today than when itappeared four centuries ago. Gerard was a member ofthe Barber-Surgeon's Company in London. Much ofwhat we find in the Herbal was taken from HenryLyte's translation of another herbal written byRembert Dodoens.The Compleat Herbal was written by Joseph Pittonde Tournefort (1656-1708). It was a translation andexpansion of his earlier work \"Elemens de Botanique\"(1694). The work appeared in two volumes, dated1719 and 1730.Herbarum Vivae Eicones by Otto Brunfels is a threevolume work that was the first to base its illustrationson living plants. Seventy-seven of the originalwatercolor paintings by Hans Weiditz were found inthe attic of the Bern Botanical Institute in 1930.Charles Singer (1927) noted that, \"Most herbalremedies are quite devoid of any rational basis. It maybe taken for granted that the writer of the herbal isunable to treat evidence on a scientific basis. \"THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURESIt was particularly during the Age of the Herbals thatthe Doctrine of Signatures became a popular belief. Ifthe idea had a special champion, it was the Swissphysician and alchemist Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus(born Theophrastus Bom-bastus von Hohenheim). Theconcept is captured in the following quotes:\"Though sin and Satan have plunged mankind into anocean of infirmities, yet the mercy of God which isover all His works has made the grass to grow uponthe mountains and herbs for the use of man and Hehas not only stamped upon these a distinct form, butalso has given them particular signatures wherebymen may read, even in legible characters, the use ofthem.\""
