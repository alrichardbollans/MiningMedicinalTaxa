      "text": "At set times, the clinician visited each trial participant to rate the severity of each symptom, giving a maximum of three marks for each symptom. The tabulation of this data in the different patients over the set, 10-day period could then provide a visual presentation of the performance of Heantos in \"alleviating withdrawal from drug addiction\", especially when compared against a non-compliant group of trial subjects (as happened in the first trial), a group receiving a different treatment (as happened in the second controlled trial), or against a group receiving placebo (as is planned to happen in the University of Essen trials). As the two first controlled trials were only ten days in length, the scientific committee could not conclude anything about the efficacy of Heantos in \"curing\" addiction by eliminating cravings in the long-term, which has been one of its claims. Instead they were limited to commenting on the short-term efficacy of Heantos in alleviating withdrawal symptoms (including craving) during a ten-day detoxification treatment. Conclusions from the first controlled trial which compared the detoxification of 23 patients receiving Heantos to that of a group of five non-compliant patients, were that: in general, we found that Heantos supports the alleviation of withdrawal from drug addiction. The medicine has effects that reduce cravings, reduce paraesthesia, reduce symptoms of digestive disorder, recover the patients' sleep habits and that help the patients recover their health rapidly as well as clear their minds. (Vietnam. Institute of Chemistry. 1999: 43) Conclusions from the second controlled trial were that: ATK [neuroleptic] therapy is more efficacious than Heantos in alleviating paraesthesia and insomnia whereas symptoms of diarrhoea and mydriasis were minor and appeared with lower frequency in patients treated with Heantos. The efficacy of Heantos is weaker than ATK therapy in alleviating drug craving. However, the overall health of patients treated with Heantos recovered more rapidly than of those treated with ATK (Vietnam. Central Psychiatric Hospital. 2002: 50-1) At the same time, another confounding factor for the scientific committee has been an ongoing and parallel effort to improve extraction methods in the production of Heantos (see 145 chapter 6). While the very first 'quasi-experimental' studies were carried out with Heantos in its original liquid-syrup form, and the first two controlled trials were carried out with the first-ever batch of Heantos capsules produced at the Institute of Chemistry in April 1998 following two years of collaboration between Tran Khuong Dan and plant chemists, by the time the controlled trials had been completed a new \"improved\" batch had been produced in October of 2001 following further phytochemical extraction and isolation work on the thirteen different plants that make up Heantos. Nonetheless, notwithstanding these systematic and formalised efforts by an appointed national scientific committee to evaluate the short-term efficacy of Heantos in the alleviation of withdrawal from opiate addiction, scepticism has persisted both outside of the Asian region as well as within Vietnam. For example, local media in Hanoi reported the alleged deaths of up to six patients after treatment with Heantos in 1998, including suggestions by other herbalists (who it should be pointed out promoted rival detoxification remedies) that Tran Khuong Dan was an \"impostor\" (see Boggan 1998). The WHO, while suggesting that preliminary Vietnamese clinical research results \"indicate the potential of Heantos\" has stressed that \"international clinical testing\" must be a crucial component of \"a rigorous process of scientific evaluation\" (WHO 2000a). Another UN agency, the UN Drug Control Programme, has argued that \"there is insufficient information available... [and that] there does not appear to be any evidence that Heantos is more effective than any other products available for a similar 'treatment'\" (UNDCP 2001). And finally, a recent article on Heantos in Nature suggested that international testing was necessary as \"clinical research is weak in Vietnam\" (Aldhous 2005: 569). For these kinds of reasons, the UN-funded project included from its beginning in 1996 a parallel drive to gain international recognition of the efficacy of Heantos via three specific routes: the treatment of a handful of foreign nationals to gain testimonial evidence of its efficacy on 'non-Vietnamese', the invitation of an international expert group of doctors and clinicians to witness the treatment of addicts with Heantos in Vietnam, and, finally, preparation of a double blind randomised controlled trial to be carried out in Germany (the first planned trial outside of Vietnam). In the late 1990s, foreign nationals from Switzerland, Denmark, USA and Ghana were given permission to follow a treatment course of Heantos \"on an exceptional basis\", as prescribed by inventor Tran Khuong Dan and closely monitored by both Vietnamese and accompanying medical doctors (UNOPS 1998b). The process was relatively similar in each 146 case, with international doctors responsible for preparing case histories on each subject that had been voluntarily selected in their country of origin, accompanying subjects to monitor their treatment with Heantos in Vietnam, reporting on what they had observed and, in a number of cases, securing testimonials from the treated subjects as well.79 While these treatments were not designed as part of the formalised validation process, one of the more or less explicit rationales for securing these testimonials was to demonstrate that Heantos had an efficacy that was not somehow socio-culturally esoteric to Vietnam but rather 'universal' in a \"diversity of cultural situations\" (UNOPS 1998a: 8). As we saw earlier, both the inventor of Heantos and his scientist partners were well aware of biomedical scepticism towards traditional medicine. In May 1999, five doctors and clinicians with experience in the treatment of drug addicts from America, Denmark, Sweden and Norway were invited by the Institute of Chemistry in Hanoi to visit Vietnam in order to \"assess the utilisation and efficacy of Heantos\" (Baehr, et al. 1999). The goal of this mission was to obtain the expert opinions of 'western' doctors and clinicians on the potential of Heantos as an addiction treatment, or put in another way, to secure 'level IV evidence' (see Table 2) on the efficacy of Heantos. During its six days in Hanoi, the international group of experts was given the opportunity to follow the detoxification of nine Vietnamese addicts and five western addicts. The addicts were given a treatment of Heantos according to a regimen provided by inventor Tran Khuong Dan, which was divided into two phases, a 72-hour detoxification followed by three to four days to \"restore the health condition of the detoxed addict\" (Baehr, et al. 1999: appendix 2). While underlining the inherent limitations of such short observations, the expert group did conclude that based on their knowledge of addiction treatment \"Heantos appears to be a better agent for detoxification than the standard methods used in... the western world\", and 79 A typical testimonial reads: \"I flew out to Hanoi... and took the Heantos treatment. Since then I have not touched any drugs. The detox was good. It took away all the physical pain right from the first day. It also got rid of all the mental desire. I no longer want to take drugs. I did not do anything special for this to happen. I just took Heantos. The treatment is so perfect that the first night I slept 8 hours and then got up and went out for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It was like that for the rest of the treatment. I do understand that after reading my words you must be thinking that I am still on drugs or completely off my trolley. But I can assure you that this treatment really works. I actually am not going to go on about how wonderful it is but let me say this, that with the quantities of cocaine, heroin, and 90 milligrams of methadone I was using, I would of need at least 6 months to get a good nights sleep, not mentioning the other BS that goes along with it. I think in the past 2 months I must of had 2 sleepless nights. I don't really think I should complain about that or consider that a withdrawal symptom but, I had to complain about something or it just wouldn't be me. I still wonder how those small capsules could do such a job. Heantos is actually the drug addicts dream come true, a pain free detox in 4 days and no more cravings to use again\" (from http://hometown.aol.com/heanto/, accessed on 9 November 2005). 147 Plate 1 Clinical outcome measures Table and graph of modified Himmelsbach withdrawal scale tracking withdrawal symptoms of a non-compliant 'control' group (Nhom I) compared with two groups (Nhom II & Nhom III) following separate regimens of Heantos treatment over ten days (Vietnam.

Finally, following a similar visit to Vietnam by German clinicians from the University of Essen later in the same year, the regional government of Nord-Rhein Westfalen agreed to fund a double-blind randomised controlled trial in Essen at the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy. The trial, which is pending final authorisation from German health officials,80 has been designed as a double-blind randomised controlled trial with the efficacy of Heantos in treating withdrawal compared to a placebo arm. As we have seen, the efforts to validate the efficacy of Heantos can be understood as a series of more or less coherent attempts to ascend the WHO's levels-of-evidence hierarchy, especially in the face of scientific scepticism towards traditional medicine on the one hand, but also towards the capacity of Vietnamese scientists to carry out \"rigorous\" research on the other. At the same time, assessments of Heantos' efficacy in the alleviation of withdrawal symptoms have relied on standardised diagnostic admissions criteria to identify relevant trial subjects, as well as standardised clinical outcome measures which allow for the quantification and tabulation of clinical trial results. While the trial results to have come out of Vietnam so far have on the whole been positive, this has not as yet translated into the \"international recognition\" that clinical testing outside of Vietnam is considered requisite by, for example, the WHO and UNDCP, who have at best been sceptical of the capacity of Vietnamese scientists to carry out \"rigorous\" clinical trials. Moreover, as we will be seeing, the ongoing effort to scientifically develop Heantos that has resulted in frequent formula changes has opened up the question of just what is being tested for efficacy: a particular active ingredient, a whole plant extract, many different whole plant extracts combined in a specific (yet changing) way, or an entire 'holistic' way of treating addiction which includes the use of Heantos? Let us now turn to the past twenty years worth of efforts to validate the efficacy of St. John's Wort in the treatment of depression. Templates of healing - St. John's Wort and the psychometrics of depression While Heantos has been subject to relatively few clinical trials to date, the same cannot be said of St. John's Wort. In fact, together with garlic (allium sativum) and ginkgo (ginkgo biloba), St. John's Wort (hypericum perforatum) has become one of the most clinically 80 This was the status in October 2006. 150 studied plants in the world.81 As described in the introduction to this chapter, although there had been some interest in the anti-depressant action of St. John's Wort throughout the 20th century, the vast majority of its clinical testing has taken place in the past two decades. And not so surprisingly, it was in Germany that this late 20th century intensification of clinical studies began,82 eventually spreading to America and Europe. In December 1984, the German Commission E83 published the first of 360 medicinal herb monographs based on extensive bibliographic reviews. Among these was a monograph for the well-known German folk remedy plant johanniskraut. While there was little clinical data available at the time on St. John's Wort, an otherwise long bibliographic reference trail led the 24-person Commission (made up of physicians, pharmacists, non-biomedical practitioners, pharmacologists, toxicologists and biostatisticians) to list \"psychovegetative disturbances, depressive moods, anxiety and/or nervous unrest\" as possible treatment uses for it, as well as to note that \"a mild antidepressant action of the herb and its preparations has been observed and reported by numerous physicians\" (Heilpflanzen-Welt 2005). As it happened, this positive monograph would be an important catalyst for a spate of clinical trials in the ensuing ten years, a good part of which were funded by herbal medicine manufacturer Lichtwer Pharma in Germany (see Muller 2005). By the mid 1990s, at least 37 clinical trials had been carried out on extracts of hypericum, enough for Linde et al. (1996) to carry out the first meta-analysis of clinical trials that had compared the efficacy of St. John's Wort in the treatment of depression against either placebo or standard antidepressant treatments. Based on these inclusion criteria, Linde et al. analysed 23 out of the 37 identified trials, concluding that \"there is evidence that extracts of hypericum are more effective than placebo for the treatment of mild to moderately severe depressive disorders\" (1996: 253). While use of St. John's Wort had been growing steadily in Germany since 1984,84 it was this meta-analysis published in the British Medical Journal, together with some of the first pre-clinical study results on possible pharmacological 81 A simple PubMed clinical trial-related search gave 109 articles for 'allium', 195 for 'ginkgo' and 116 for 'hypericum'. See also American Botanical Council (1999). 82 As mentioned earlier, Dr. K. Daniel had carried out the first controlled trials with hypericum perforatum before WWII broke out, reflecting a significant German scientific tradition in plant bio-chemistry that was consistent throughout the 20th century (see Timmermann 2001). 83 A commission established by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices following the passing of Germany's Second Medicines Act in 1976 to review the safety and efficacy of 'phytomedicines' available on the German market. 84 By 1997, johanniskraut extract had become the most prescribed single antidepressant in Germany, making up as much as 25% of all prescriptions for antidepressants, sales of Licthwer Pharma's St. John's Wort extracts tripled from $23 million in 1994 to $66 million in 1996 (Muller 2005: 2; Nash and Cray 1997). 151 antidepressant mechanisms of action published in 1994 and 1997 Pharmacopsychiatry supplements, that would re-introduce St. John's Wort to the English-speaking world. In an interesting coincidence, in the exact same months that news of Heantos was breaking in the world press in 1997, a flurry of media stories suggesting that St. John's Wort might be \"Nature's Prozac\" also emerged, citing the recently published clinical and pre-clinical research (see Andrews 1997; Hicks 1997; Johnson, et al. 1997; Nash and Cray 1997). And the effect of this media storm would be tangible as St. John's Wort virtually overnight transformed into one of the world's first herbal 'blockbusters' throughout Europe and America, notwithstanding persistent reminders from herbal practitioners that Hypericum has a much wider use and is most often used by herbalists as one element of a holistic 'polypharmacy' approach (Chevallier 1999: 12, 91).85 Today, two decades after Commission E's monograph was first published, extracts of St. John's Wort remain a popular treatment for especially mild depression, and there is no sign that clinical interest is abating.86 At the same time, it cannot be said that a clear consensus has emerged as to the therapeutic merits of St. John's Wort in the treatment of depression. Debates have centred around five specific concerns: the possibility that St. John's Wort extract can negatively interact with other commonly used drugs; the drastically varied quality of extracts available to unknowing consumers; pharmacologic debates over which of the many active ingredients found in St. John's Wort extract (if any) are responsible for antidepressant activity (which has bearing on extract standardisation and quality control of products); disputes over whether St. John's Wort is only effective in cases of mild depression as opposed to moderate and major depression;87 and finally, whether it is more effective than standard antidepressants. On the other hand, it is widely agreed that St. John's Wort has a much better safety profile than pharmaceutical antidepressants, although concerns about negative drug interactions and low quality extracts have certainly troubled this consensus to some extent. 85 The sales figures for the US market were spectacular in the final years of the 1990s, with some estimates suggesting that sales jumped 190% from $48 million in 1997 to $140 million in 1998. In Europe, sales figures for 1998 have been estimated at $6 billion. And in Britain, an estimated 2 million people were using St. John's Wort in 2000."
