ROOT CROPSThis category of food plants includes those with edibleroots, underground root-like stems, subterranean leafbases, and combinations of these tissues. In otherwords, root crops are not limited to just those foodplants that have edible roots, as the name might wellimply. In general, root crops are:' mostly water;' high in starches and/or sugars;' low in proteins and oils;' not easily stored, transported, or marketed;' not the basis of a balanced diet;' sometimes consumed raw, but often requireheating or some other processing to destroytoxins.The annual tonnage of the major root crops is almostas great as the cereal production. They exceed themajor cereals in their nutritional yield in terms ofmillions of calories per acre: potato = 4.84; rice =2.77; maize = 2.55; wheat = 1.61.THE IRISH POTATO\"Two things are too serious to talk about - marriageand potatoes.\" [Old Irish saying]\"... a scarcely innocent underground stem. \"[John Ruskin, 1869]Also known as the Irish or white potato, Solanumtuberosum probably originated in the AndeanMountains of Bolivia and Peru. It has been in usethere since at least A.D. 200 and it is still in commonuse. The potato is a tuber, a starchy, underground-61-stem. The eyes are buds; leaf scars are also evidenton the surface. The tuber is about 70-80% water, 8-28% starch, and 1-4% protein. The food value variesgreatly with cultivar, growth conditions, storage, andhandling. In Solanum tuberosum, x = 12 and there are diploids,tetraploids, and hexaploids. The Tuberosum Group, towhich our cultivars belong, is tetraploid (2n= 4x =48).TIMELINE: IRISH POTATOBCE:11,000 First archaeological remains (Chile)5,000 Alkaloid-free diploids evolve5,000 Domesticated ? ?CE:1533 First seen by Europeans (Pizzaro)1553 First European reference (\"Chronica del Peru\")1570 Introduced into Spain1585 Introduced into Italy1586 Introduced into England1588 Introduced into Ireland1590 Jose de Acosta describes chuno making1597 First printed illustration (Gerard's \"Herball\")1601 \"It springs from a bulb\" (Clusius)1619 Gaspard Bauhin names it Solanumtuberosum esculentum1622 Governor of Bermuda sends them to Governorof Virginia1625 Now a food staple in Ireland1651 German Grand Elector forces their planting andconsumption1662 Royal Society considers planting throughoutEngland1664 John Forster publishes \"England's HappinessIncreased...\"1697 Introduced into Russia by Peter the Great1719 Introduced to U.

The potato was brought to Europe in themid-1500's and was planted extensively in NorthAmerica by about 1700. The plant was not animmediate success, for a variety of reasons. It wasseen to be a member of the nightshade family(Solanaceae), a group of plants long known for theirtoxic properties. There were also cultural and religiousbiases against the potato. Later its reputation changedand it became very popular. Often its planting was theresult of a royal edict. The potato became a dominantfood in the diet of the Irish. The \"late blight of potato,\"caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans, wipedout the Irish crops two consecutive years (1845-1847). It is estimated that 1.5 million died as a resultof the famine and that perhaps another millionIrishmen immigrated to the U.S.TOXICITY. When exposed to sunlight, potato tubersmake chlorophyll and turn green. They also increaseproduction of a toxin called solanine. It has causedsickness and death in domesticated animals that eatgreen tubers, but it rarely causes problems in humansbecause we destroy the toxin during the cookingprocess.USES.The potato is not just a food plant for us and forsome of our domesticated animals. Its starch is usedin textiles, paper, confections, and adhesives, and tomake industrial alcohol. Chicha is a South Americanbeer made from fermented potatoes. Schnapps is alsomade from potatoes.SWEET POTATOIpomoea batatas, a relative of the ornamentalmorning glory and the weedy bindweeds, is a trailingvine of tropical lowlands. The plants are vegetativelypropagated; many strains rarely flower. Its origin isstill a matter of controversy. It was probably used inboth the Old World and New World before Columbus.Current thinking appears to favor New World tropicallowlands as the sweet potato's ancestral home. Notethe similarities in common names:kumar * Quechua Indians (Andes)kumara * Polynesian islandsumara * Tahitiumala * Samoauwala * Hawai'iThe plant is very popular in the southern U.S., whereit is often called a yam. The true yams are entirelydifferent species and are rarely seen in this country.China is the leading producer of sweet potatoes. It has50% more calories than the Irish potato, usually lessprotein (1.5-2.0%), and is a good source of Vitamin A.The sweet potato is a polyploid (2n = 4x = 60 and 6x= 90).Henry VIII loved sweet potato pie. He thought that itwas good for his love life, a common belief of thetime. William Shakespear makes reference to thiswhen he has Falstaff hoping that the sky would rainpotatoes.CASSAVAManihot esculenta has a number of common names,including manioc and yuca (not to be confused withyucca, an entirely unrelated plant). Cassava is amember of the spurge family, known for its manytoxic species. It is a shrubby perennial of the tropicallowlands. It was originally from South America,perhaps eastern Brazil. In Africa and in the WestIndies, cassava is cooked and then pounded into adough to make fufu, a traditional African pudding.The plant is not widely known outside of the tropics,-62-although there it is a very important plant. While youmay not know a cassava when you see it, you doknow a product made from its roots - tapioca. Thestarch from cassava and maize were used to makepostage stamp glue.The edible part is a series of swollen roots. With littlecare the plants will yield 10 tons of roots/acre. Theroots contain a poisonous glycoside that will yield HCN(hydrogen cyanide or Prussic acid) when it breaksdown. We have learned by trial and error that theroots must be heated to drive off this toxic gas. Theroots are consumed whole after boiling, or pulverizedand dried to a meal called farinha. The juices are alsoused to make alcoholic beverages and as a componentin meat sauces (West Indian pepper pot).YAMSFirst, please note that yams and sweet potatoes arenot the same thing, and that while all of the sweetpotatoes belong to a single species, there are severalspecies of yams. Dioscorea spp. are perennial climbingvines of the tropics. Three \"Groups\" are oftenrecognized: Asian, African, and America. Only one, thecush-cush yam, is native to the New World. The vineshave large storage tubers that can weigh up to severalhundred pounds. The plants may have aerial tubers aswell. The yam is a very important food in the WestIndies, much of South America, in Asia, and the SouthSea Islands. It is baked, boiled, or ground into flour.The yam is mostly starch. Several million tons areproduced each year.In addition to being an important root crop, the yamhas ritual and medicinal uses. I will tell you about thatlater in the semester.THE TRUE YAMS (DIOSCOREA)New World:D. trifida Cush-cush yam, ajam, yampiAfrica:D. abyssinica RikuaD. cayenensis Yellow Guinea yamD. dumetorum Bitter yam, 3-leaved yamD. bulbifera Potato-yam, air-potatoD. elephantipes Elephant's footD. rotundata White yam, Guinea yamAsia:D. alata Greater yam, water yamD. bulbifera Potato-yam, air-potatoD. esculenta Lesser yam, Asiatic y., Chinese y.D. hispida Intoxicating yam, namiD. japonica Japanese yamD. nummularia KerungD. opposita Chinese yamD. pentaphylla Sand yam, buck yamD. praehensilis Bush yam, forest yamPacific Islands:D. papuanD. spinosa Spiny yamTARO\"One man's meal is another man's poi, son. \"(Restauranteur in Honolulu Polynesian bistro)' ' ' ' 'Colocasia esculenta, a member of the philodendronfamily, is very widely used by the peoples ofSoutheast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plants livein moist to swampy areas, seldom flower, andtypically have large leaf blades shaped like elephantears. The fleshy corms are eaten boiled, baked, ormashed; or they may be dried and pulverized. Thesetreatments destroy the calcium oxalate crystalspresent in the underground structures. These crystalsare quite characteristic of the family.In Hawai'i, the plant is known as kalo. Its leaves areluau; the same word is also used for a soup made oftaro leaves and for the well known feast. As a soup,\"... it is as delicate, wholesome, and agreeable a oneas any in the world.\" (Sturvevant, 1919). The leavesare also called callaloo, as is a Caribbean soup madefrom taro leaves, okra, yams, chili peppers, andcoconut milk."
