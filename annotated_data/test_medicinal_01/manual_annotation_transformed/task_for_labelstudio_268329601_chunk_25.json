Also known as the vegetable pear orchristophine, Sechium edule is native to Mexico andCentral America where it was widely used by the Aztecpeople. Its fruit is 1-seeded and it has a greenishflesh. Its tubers are also edible. Once ratheruncommon, chayote is now a standard fixture in manyof our markets in this country.Cassabanana. Also known as the musk cucumber,sikana, or melocoton, Sicana odorifera is foundthroughout tropical America. It resembles a very largecucumber, but with orange-yellow flesh. Fresh fruitsare added to soups and stews, but it is more popularwhen made into a jam. The specific epithet suggeststhat the plant has an odor about it. In this case it is apleasant one and the fruits have been used to makelinens smell better.Melons. Cucumis melo, native to Africa and perhapsalso to Southeast Asia, is the source of a number ofthe \"dessert fruits,\" such as the honeydew, Persian,musk, casaba, cranshaw melons and the cantaloupe.They are not mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptiantexts, but do appear later in Roman works.TOMATO[The tomato is an] \"... evil fruit... treacherous anddeceitful.\" (Henri LeClerc)\" ... a person who should eat a sufficient abundance ofthese apples would never die.\"(Dr. Siccaary)Lycopersicon esculentum has had several commonnames through the centuries, including love-apple,mala peruviana, tomatl (an Aztec word from which wederive tomate and tomata), pomi dei Moro, pommed'amour, and pomi d'oro. It is a New World plant,native to the Andes of Ecuador or Peru. Its famespread slowly upon its introduction into Europebecause it was recognized as a member of thenightshade family (Solanaceae) and, therefore,thought to be toxic. The Europeans were correct -- itis toxic under certain circumstances. Its use as a foodplant is relatively recent.EGGPLANTAlso called the aubergine, mad-apple, spawn of hell,etc., Solanum melongena is a relative of the potato,tomato, and other nightshades. It is a native ofnorthern India, near Burma. The fruit is a large egg-shaped berry, typically purple or black in the cultivarsthat we grow in temperate areas. In tropical regions,yellow- and white-fruited forms are common. Theeggplant is a minor crop in the United States, withFlorida being the leading producer.As with the tomato, the eggplant was not alwayspopular as a food plant... and with good reason!Through the centuries, various authors havesuggested that it can cause insanity (one of itscommon names is mala insana), leprosie, cancer,hemorrhoids, melancholy, cancer, pustules, badbreath, changes in skin color, and obstructions in theliver and spleen.I also encourage you to consider the following itemsthat I have assembled after many years of research.I offer them as part of my continuing effort to bring anunsuspecting world the truth about the hideous purpleperil.' Not a single major religious leader (Moses, Jesus ofNazareth, Mohammed, the Buddha, etc.) everrecommended eggplant to his followers, nor is itmentioned in the sacred writings of any of theworld's great religions.' The country that grows the most eggplants isCommunist China. What more needs to be said?' Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Saddam Hussein allate the eggplant.' Lord Byron's \"Ode to an Aubergine\" was sosavaged by literary critics that he destroyed allexisting copies.' Martha Stewart was overcome by the fumes of aneggplant as she attempted to prepare it on hernationally syndicated television program. Sherecovered fully.' The Central Intelligence Agency once used a toxicextract from the eggplant in an attempt to kill FidelCastro.' Mama Cass Elliot did not choke to death on a hamsandwich, as widely reported in the press. Aneggplant became lodged in her throat.' The Monsanto Corporation, using secret techniquesof genetic engineering, has developed a polyploideggplant that can cross with wheat, rice, andmaize and replace them in the fields.As if more evidence were needed, consider thefollowing astounding statistics:' 100% of all Americans who ate eggplant in 1880subsequently died!' 92.6% of all patients in this country's mentalhospitals ate eggplant.' 87.2% of all heroin addicts began by eatingeggplants.' 98.4% of all individuals who listen to RushLimbaugh on the radio have eaten eggplant.' 82.1% of all divorces occurred in couples who hadconsumed eggplant.' 78.9% of all fatal automobile accidents happenedafter eating eggplants.' Only 0.09% of young, innocent children likeeggplant on first eating it.NUTRITIONAL ANALYSIS OF EGGPLANTWater 80.0 %Carbohydrates 00.0 %Sugars 00.0 %Fat 00.0 %Calories 00.0 %Inert material 21.0 %Purple Peril Death Factor 02.0 %-83-How does the eggplant compare with other edible andinedible material?

It has been cultivated since antiquity. Itis a member of the mulberry family (Moraceae). Asimilar plant, the Osage-orange or bois d'arc, grows inthe United States. The breadfruit is a false fruit, beingformed by the fusion of many true fruits to produce asingle, large, warty \"fruit.\" Unlike most fruits, thebreadfruit is high in starch (30-40%). It is not eatenfresh, but is typically baked, boiled, or fried. Althoughits seeds are edible, the seedless strains are the mostcommonly used. An eight year old tree can produce700-800 fruits.The cultivars with large, edible seeds are called thebreadnut. Here the surrounding flesh is discardedand the seeds are boiled. They taste like chestnuts.Most of us in this country have never seen breadfruit,but we have heard of the plant because of a famousevent in history. In 1787, Lt. William Bligh was sent toTahiti to collect breadfruit seedlings for eventualtransplanting to feed slaves in the West Indies. As youknow, on the return voyage, the crew of H. M. A. T.Bounty mutinied against the captain and put him andeighteen others (including the ship's botanist, DavidNelson) into a small boat. They survived a grueling 41day ocean voyage. The mutineers, led by FletcherChristian, established their new home on PitcairnIsland. Bligh went on to become a Vice Admiral in theRoyal Navy and a Governor in Australia.Two close relatives of the breadfruit are the jackfruit,also spelled jakfruit (A. heterophyllus), whose giantfruits can weigh about 70 lbs., and the marang (A.odoratissima, whose scientific name suggests one ofits best known features -- it is highly aromatic.OKRAAbelmoschus esculentus [= Hibiscus e. in the olderliterature] is native to Africa, perhaps the Upper NileValley. It came to the New World via slaves in the 16thcentury. They also brought with them dried peas,yams, and ackee, an interesting fruit. Okra is relatedto hibiscus and cotton. This is fairly evident when youexamine the flowers. It is a very popular vegetable,especially in French Louisiana where it is used insoups, stews, etc. Some people object to its slimy,mucilaginous nature. We eat the immature fruit, acapsule. If you let it mature, it gets almost woody andsplits open. What is the best way to serve okra? Tosomeone else!SPAGHETTI TREEWe have become so accustomed to eating artificialspaghetti that many of us are unaware that thenatural version grows on plants. Pastadendron italica,the spaghetti tree, is native to the hilly regions of theMediterranean. The edible portion is a stringyoutgrowth on the surface of seeds. In the earlysummer, the tree's woody pods split open to revealnumerous seeds, each with a string of carbohydrate-rich tissue about 30 cm long. It is a curious sight tosee hundreds of these trees with their strands ofspaghetti dangling gracefully in the wind. Processingis simple, but laborious. Workers, usually of thepeasant class, move through the spaghetti treeplantations and harvest the material manually.Attempts to mechanize the process have not beensuccessful. As with cotton, it is necessary to separatethe seed, which will be discarded, from the desiredportion. This is done by hand, one seed at a time. Thetissue is then washed and placed in the sun to dry bycarefully arranging the spaghetti on a network ofstrings or wire drying racks. Almost all of the work isdone by women. A few years ago, the BBC producedan award-winning documentary on the harvesting andprocessing of spaghetti. A particularly touching part ofthe film showed women singing various harvestingsongs as they plucked the spaghetti from the trees.Historically, the very best spaghetti came from treesgrown around Tuscany. Unfortunately, almost all ofthem were destroyed during World War II. Thisprompted the research to produce artificial spaghetti,as did a dramatic increase in the popularity ofMediterranean foods. Attempts to improve spaghetti'snutritional quality and the length of the strandsthrough hybridization with other species ofPastadendron have not been successful. The Italiangovernment has funded a spaghetti tree germplasmcenter (\"seed bank\") in Rome, in an attempt topreserve the genetic heritage of the species. To date,five genomes have been identified.Real spaghetti is once again available in our localmarkets, but it is quite a bit more expensive. It issold under the label \"Spaghetti Antigua\" or \"Spaghettia la Tuscany.\" It must be kept refrigerated. Once youhave eaten the real thing, you will never go back tothe insipid, artificial version.-84-FRUITS THAT WE CALL VEGETABLESCommon Name (Scientific Name) Plant Family OriginAfrican aubergine (Solanum macrocarpum) Nightshade East Africaaubergine (Solanum melongena) Nightshade AsiaBalsam pear (Momordica charantia) Squash Old Worldbeans (Various genera) 1 Bean New Worldbreadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) Mulberry Malaysiacalabaza (Cucurbita moschata) Squash North Americachayote (Sechium edule) Squash C.

See the discussion ofpulses elsewhere in the syllabus for a more complete listing.2. The garden or English pea belongs to the genus Pisum. The black-eyed pea is a kind of Vigna; the chickpeaor garbanzo bean belongs to the genus Cicer.3. Most of the commonly encountered squashes (crookneck, banana, summer, scallop, butter, etc.) belong toCucurbita or Cucumis.-85-5.10 ! FRUITS OF THETEMPERATE ZONEMany of the fruits that we commonly eat, with theexception of the banana, citrus fruits, and thepineapple, come from temperate areas of the world.Most of these fruits are intensively cultivated, ratherthan being fruits easily available in the wild state. Therose family (Rosaceae) is the single largest source ofthese species.Most of the temperate fruits are of Old World origin.Many of them have been in cultivation since ancienttimes. In more advanced societies, fruits are not astaple. They provide interesting flavors and variety toour table. Some of them are high in vitamins, variousorganic acids, and mineral content. For the most part,however, they are nutritionally poor. They are mostlywater. Because of the high water content and theirtexture, many fruits are perishable. Pickling, canning,and freezing have allowed their shipment around theworld. So has rapid air transportation.SURVEY OF TEMPERATE FRUITSAPPLE. Malus sylvestris probably ranks first ineconomic importance and extent of cultivation. It isnative to the Caucasus Mountains of western Asia. Wehave perpetuated, and to some extent developed,over 6500 horticultural forms. The Old World specieswere introduced into the United States by colonistswho were dissatisfied with the fruits of the nativespecies.A ripe apple is about 84% water, 11% sugar, and0.3% protein. It is usually harvested ripe, because itwill not ripen well after being picked. Apples are verysensitive to a variety of insect and fungal pests.PEAR. Pyrus communis is native to Eurasia. The plantis similar to the apple in appearance. It is propagatedeither by seed or by grafting. The United Statesproduces about one-quarter of the total output. Pearsare picked before they reach full maturity.APRICOT. Prunus armeniaca is an Asian species. Ithas been used in China since about 2000 BC. Becausethe flowers are sensitive to frost, apricots are grownin warmer climates. They were introduced intoCalifornia in the 18th century. Sun dried fruits arevery popular.PEACH. Prunus persica is native to China. Like theapricot, it is an ancient fruit. It was introduced intothe United States by the early colonists. Today it issecond only to the apple in importance in this country.The nectarine, sometimes distinguished as P. persicavar. nectarina is a peach without fuzz, often with aricher flavor. It is not a hybrid, as many peoplebelieve.PLUMS AND PRUNES. Several species of Prunus, amember of the rose family, are the source of plums.The ones that reach our tables are derived fromEurope, Japan, or they are native to North America.The plum industry in this country is centered on thePacific coast. Prunes are merely plums with a highsugar content. They can be cured without removingthe stone inside.STRAWBERRY. The two most important species inthe United States are Fragaria chiloensis, which isnative to the New World from Chile to the westerncoast of North America, and F. virginica, a wildstrawberry native to the eastern part of the continent.Both species are octaploids. The European \"ever-bearing strawberry\" (F. vesca) is a diploid. Except forthis species, the cultivated strawberries are allpropagated by runners or stolons; they reproduceasexually. The \"fruit\" is very sensitive to pressure andcan be easily bruised. Most strawberries are,therefore, handpicked. Unlike most other temperatefruits, the strawberry is the result of an intensiveselection and breeding program.The edible portion of the strawberry is not the fruititself, but the expanded, swollen stem tip that bearstiny, hard, seed-like fruits. Most of us would bedelighted if breeders could only get rid of those peskylittle fruits so that we could better enjoy the succulent,sugary stem. \"Doubtless God could have made a better berry, butdoubtless God never did.\" (William Butler)BRAMBLES. From the single genus Rubus, we derivethe raspberry, blackberry, thimbleberry, dewberry,youngberry, loganberry, boysenberry, and a series oflesser known kinds. The berry is not really a berry inthe botanical sense, but an aggregation of numeroussmall, fleshy fruits giving the appearance of a singlestructure.CURRANTS AND GOOSEBERRIES. We eat bothnative and introduced species. Gooseberry plants havebristly branches and 1-3 fruits in a cluster. Currantsdo not have bristles and typically have 4 or morefruits in a cluster. Often currants are used in the formof jelly."
