      "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has emphasised the need to control the quality of HMs by using modern control techniques and standards (WHO, 1998). The application of molecular techniques in identifying substitute and adulterant species in HMs has been widely investigated; hence, DNA-based techniques have been used to accurately recognise plant species in HMs (Howard, 2010). Vassou et al. (2015) highlight the problems of species substitution and adulteration in their study of Indian country mallow also known as 'Bala' in Ayurveda (Sida cordifolia L.). They bought 25 market samples of raw material from thirteen states in India. They used DNA barcoding techniques to identify the species of the samples collected, and found that none of the samples were Sida cordifolia; instead, 76% were identified as other Sida species and the remaining 24% were from other genera. Several of the samples were identified as Sida acuta Burm.f. which has six times more ephedrine in comparison to Sida cordifolia; this may be associated with adverse effects. The research by Vassou et al. (2015) signifies the importance of species authentication of HMs and the applications of DNA barcoding for this purpose. Contamination of Herbal Medicines Substitution of ingredients or species, and contamination with toxic substances may be a particular concern especially when HMs are not regulated (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). On several occasions Ayurvedic formulations have been found to contain heavy metals such as iron, mercury, and arsenic which can release toxic compounds in the body altering normal metabolic pathways, and can cause systemic toxicity (Ernst, 1998; Egbuna and Bose, 2005). Saper et al. (2008) found nearly two hundred Ayurvedic preparations bought over the internet had detectable levels of heavy metals which were not stated on the label. A British poison information centre, in the West Midlands, identified five cases of heavy metal contamination within seven years; the products contained lead, zinc, mercury, arsenic, 10 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra aluminium, and tin. The individuals who had consumed the contaminated HMs had concentrations of heavy metals 2-10 times the upper limit of normal physiological values, resulting in harmful effects and morbidities (Bayly et al., 1995). Contamination with undeclared prescription medicines, mefenamic acid and diazepam, was identified in some Chinese HMs; they caused severe adverse effects including gastrointestinal bleeding and renal failure (Gertner et al., 1994). HMs contaminated with microbes due to poor manufacturing, harvesting, and storage conditions have also been documented (Zhang et al., 2012). This identifies that stringent controls need to be reinforced over the manufacture, sales and supply of high quality and safe HMs. Interactions between Herbal and Conventional Medicines Herbal medicines have been used long before written records were created; despite this there is still limited clinical evidence to support the safety and efficacy of most HMs (Ernst, 1998). The incidence of herb-drug interactions are still not fully known, and there is no reliable body of information to assess the potential problems (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011; Williamson et al., 2013). An interaction is believed to occur when the effects of a drug are changed by the presence of another substance (Baxter, 2008). The effects of the drug may be mimicked or opposed by the herbal medicine; which in turn may alter the efficacy of the drug. For example, St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is known to be an enzyme inducer, affecting the Cytochrome P450 enzymes; it has been associated with reducing levels of ciclosporin leading to transplant rejection as the efficacy of the drug was reduced (Graham et al., 2008; Williamson et al., 2013). There is an increased risk of toxicity if a drug's metabolism and clearance is inhibited, especially for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range such as digoxin, lithium, or theophylline (Colalto, 2010). Due to the lack of controlled research it is difficult to ascertain the prevalence of herb-drug interactions. This has been explored further in Chapter 3, section 3.4.4.1 (p91). Adverse Effects of Herbal Medicines There may be many side-effects associated with HMs which are not acknowledged; Ravindran et al. (2009) believe, ''traditional medicines are generally free of the deleterious side effects.'' In contrary Balaji (2010) expresses concerns of toxicity in using raw plant material / extracts by stating, ''laboratory findings suggest that turmeric extracts can be 11 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra toxic to the liver when taken in high doses, or for a prolonged period of time.'' There are several well-known Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) caused by the consumption of HMs including: burning sensation and skin irritation caused by chillies (Capsicum spp.) or Aloe vera L., allergic reactions to celery or nuts, blood disorders associated with garlic, and aristolochic acid induced nephrotoxicity (Chevallier, 2007; Michl et al., 2014). The Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) collates information on ADRs from over one hundred countries and in 2010 it found 12, 679 reports of ADRs linked to HMs (UMC, 2011). Adverse effects linked to HMs reported included: anaphylaxis, anxiety, dermatitis, chest pain, toxicity and death; due to heavy metal and microbial contamination, pesticide residues, and also the wrong species of plant used in preparation of the medicine (Sahoo et al., 2010). In the UK, the MHRA established the 'Yellow Card Scheme' (YCS) to monitor the safety of healthcare products including HMs; it was designed to enable HCPs and the public to report side-effects and ADRs caused by drugs and HMs (MHRA, 2014a). The reporting of herbal ADRs remains low, just 51 reports of herbal ADRs were received by the MHRA in 2014 (MHRA, 2014b; MHRA, 2014c). 1.4.5 Regulation of Herbal Medicines In response to some of the quality issues identified with HMs, the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) was established by the Department of Indian Systems of Medicines and Homoeopathy (ISM&H) in 2003 to regulate HMs in India. AYUSH proposed to regulate Ayurvedic formulations made in India that are often distributed worldwide, by focusing on research, quality control, and education relating to HMs. The Indian government declared that traditional herbal remedies needed scientific validation to promote national and international use of HMs which have been used for centuries (Sharma, 2000). The responsibility for ensuring the safety and standards of Ayurvedic preparations lies with AYUSH. The labelling requirements are clearly stated in AYUSH guidelines (Section III, Annex A). The scope of the AYUSH regulation covers, \"the product requirements, good manufacturing practices, requirements for competence of personnel and testing of AYUSH products included in the active pharmaceutical ingredient,\" (AYUSH, n.d.). An investigation by Saper et al. (2008) found nearly two hundred Ayurvedic preparations bought over the internet had detectable levels of heavy metals, which were not stated on the label. This highlights that products failing to comply with the guidelines are still readily available. There are concerns about the quality and safety of HMs bought online as it is difficult to regulate what is being sold via the internet (The Pharmaceutical Journal, 2002). 12 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra In Europe, the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive (THMPD) was passed in 2004 by the European Parliament and Council of Europe to set out guidelines to regulate the use of HMs (Directive 2004/24/EC). Previously HMs could be marketed without an official Marketing Authorisation (MA), as long as the unlicensed products were of high quality and safe for consumption, as decided by each country on a national level. The 2004/24/EC directive led to the development of Traditional Herbal Medicine Registration Scheme (THMRS) in the UK, which meant over-the-counter HMs which made a medicinal claim, would require a Traditional Herbal Medicine Registration (THR) or a MA, by May 2011. The legislation required herbal medicinal products to have at least 30 years of evidence of their traditional use in the EU; or 15 years within the EU and 15 years elsewhere for products from other countries (European Parliament, 2004). In addition, it required safety data to be provided and the manufacturer was obliged to guarantee the quality of the product with regards to Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) and European Pharmacopoeia standards. Manufacturers were also expected to ensure pharmacovigilance procedures were in place to monitor ADRs (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). The idea was to regulate high quality and safe HMs, in addition to giving consumers the confidence in the products they were using. As of the 30th April 2011 no unlicensed herbal medicinal product could be sold in the EU unless they held a product license. Products on the market before this date were given a three year period to sell through, until 30th April 2014. The Directive 2004/24/EC defines herbal medicinal products as, \"Any medicinal product, exclusively containing as active ingredients one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations, or one or more such herbal substances in combination with one or more such herbal preparations.\" It also defines: - Herbal substances as, \"All mainly whole, fragmented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi, lichen in an unprocessed, usually dried, form, but sometimes fresh. Certain exudates that have not been subjected to a specific treatment are also considered to be herbal substances. Herbal substances are precisely defined by the plant part used and the botanical name according to the binomial system (genus, species, variety and author),\" - Herbal preparations as, \"Preparations obtained by subjecting herbal substances to treatments such as extraction, distillation, expression, fractionation, purification, concentration or fermentation. These include comminuted or powdered herbal substances, tinctures, extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and processed exudates.\" 13 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 1.5 Overview of the Research Project The initial purpose of this research was to explore the use of HMs amongst diasporic SA communities in the UK, followed by the identification of plant species in HMs using molecular techniques (Appendix 1). As DNA-based identification techniques are a relatively new way of authenticating plant species, the research team was interested in studying this phenomenon further; with the prospect of developing a specific, fast, and reliable identification tool for a selected plant species. The first phase of this study was called the South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) Project (Chapter 2); whereby, the primary aim of investigating the current use of HMs by SA communities in the UK was explored. During the development of the SATMED project a questionnaire was designed to explore whether participants were using HMs, what they were using, where ingredients were sourced from, and where their knowledge of HMs originated. One of the key themes involved exploring whether or not participants shared the information about their use of HMs with their Western HCPs. After exploring a 'patients' perspective of HMs the researcher was intrigued to understand what HCPs thought of HMs. As there is very limited research which has looked at UK HCPs knowledge and views of HMs, it was anticipated that the results would provide an original contribution to the gap in the existing literature. An online survey to explore HCPs personal and professional experiences with HMs was created and distributed using social media (Chapter 3). From the results of the SATMED questionnaire a medicinal plant or herbal remedy which could be used for molecular analysis was identified. Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) was selected as the medicinal plant for a case study of the application of DNA analysis for confirmation of genetic identity, as tulsi was identified as a culturally and commercially valuable plant during the research period (Chapter 4). The cultural, religious and medicinal uses of tulsi were investigated during interviews with participants. Tulsi samples from participants, commercial sources, and authenticated specimen were collected for DNA analysis. This phase of the research was called the 'Tulsi Project'. All three aspects of the research overlap as the concepts are a continuation from each other (Figure 1-1). The Venn diagram in Figure 1-1 represents some of the key ideas explored within each section and some of the common themes which emerged through this research. Ethical approval from the De Montfort University Ethics Committee for each phase of the research was obtained separately (Appendix 1 & 2); further details can be found in each chapter (Chapter 2, 3, and 4). 14 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra A detailed introduction in each chapter explains the aims, objectives, and rationale for the section. As the methodology was tailored to each phase it is detailed within the specific chapter; followed by a detailed analysis of the results and a discussion. The final discussion chapter (Chapter 5) summarises the key findings of this research and illustrates how the three strands of this investigation integrate and support each other; furthermore, it highlights the implications of this research and further work which could be conducted. Figure 1-1 Venn Diagram to Illustrate the Integration of the Three Phases of the Research The Venn diagram shows how the SATMED Project, HCPs survey and the Tulsi Project interlink to explore the aims and objectives of this study. 15 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.0 South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) Project 2.1 Introduction The migration of South Asians (SAs) to the United Kingdom (UK) has created an ethnically diverse population; with SAs forming 5.3% of the total UK population as uncovered by the 2011 Census (Office for National Statistics, 2012). With the migration of people to the UK they have brought with them their own herbal remedies which they may still be using; however, there is little documented evidence to support the current use of herbal medicines (HMs) by SAs in the UK (Etkin and Elisabetsky, 2005; Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Pieroni and Torry, 2007). This raises several interesting questions such as where the knowledge originates from, how it is transmitted through generations, where ingredients for traditional remedies are obtained from, and if HMs are used in conjunction with conventional Western medicines (CWM) are Western healthcare professionals (HCPs) aware. The South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) project was designed to be an exploratory survey to establish the current use of HMs by South Asian (SA) communities in the UK. This chapter will summarise the aim and objectives of this research, followed by some background information to support the need to conduct this investigation. The methodology will describe the research methods used for the SATMED project and the results section will give a detailed analysis of the findings of this study. The terms herbal remedies, traditional herbal medicines (THM), and herbal medicines (HMs) will be used interchangeably throughout this research. 2.2 Aim of the SATMED Project The aim of the SATMED project is to explore the origins, use, and transmission of knowledge of traditional herbal medicines used amongst South Asian diasporic communities in the UK. 2.3 Objectives of the SATMED Project 1. Explore the knowledge and use of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian diasporic communities; describe where the knowledge originates from and how it is transmitted. 2. Investigate where ingredients for herbal medicines are sourced from. 16 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3. Obtain insight into the relationship between South Asian people who use herbal medicines and their healthcare professionals. 4. Summarise the types of herbal medicines and plants used within South Asian communities; to establish which plant species would be suitable candidates for DNA authentication. 2.4 Background Research In order to establish why focusing on SA populations for this research is important, the background of how migration to the UK first started will be considered. Then the types of HMs and traditional medical systems used by SAs will be established to determine the origins of HMs, and evidence to support the use of HMs will be explored. 2.4.1 South Asians in the UK The Formation of South Asia The first British men went to India as traders as part of the East Indian Company (EIC) in search of spices, silk, cotton, ivory and tea. The Indian subcontinent was rich in natural resources which Europeans wanted (Kaul, 2011). The EIC began to rule areas of India and developed its own armies. After almost a century of oppressive control in India by the EIC the Indians rebelled and the British Government rule was established in 1858 (Lambert, 2014). The two hundred years of British rule in India came to an end in 1947 after which India, which was once bigger than Europe, was partitioned into independent states. The main body was left as India while the eastern and western wings were called Pakistan (Figure 2-1). In 1971 East Pakistan was renamed as Bangladesh. After this the three states and Sri Lanka collectively formed South Asia, and its people were referred to as South Asians (Healy and Aslam, 1989; Clarke et al., 1990; Brown, 2006). Figure 2-1 Map of India Pre and Post Partitioning (adapted from Brown, 2006) 17 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Migration of South Asians to the UK Migration from South Asia started early in the 19th century when SAs first moved to countries such as Mauritius, British Guiana, and Trinidad (Clarke et al., 1990). By the late 20th century SAs had become widely spread across Europe, Africa, Asia, America, and the Middle East (Brown, 2006). Reasons for migration may have been forced (e.g. contracts of indenture or refugees), or free willed - the migration of traders, entrepreneurs, labourers, and professionals. Service in the British army took men from India across the world and as transport links improved, migration became easier so people emigrated to seek new opportunities. During the partitioning of India in 1947 there was large-scale immigration to the UK from India and Pakistan due to the violence and unrest. This first mass migration can be broadly divided into religious groups as Sikhs from India and Muslims from East and West Pakistan."
