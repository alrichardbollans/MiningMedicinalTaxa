Gang et al. 2004. 1369 Tonkin 2004. 1370 Functional Ingredients September 2005 China News. 1371 60 to 95 years.1372 These fi gures are based on the International Diabetes Foundation defi nition of metabolic syndrome. Yao et al. 2006. 1373 Apparently the situation is worse in the U.S. Around 25 % of Americans have the metabolic syndrome. Over 40 % of Americans over 60 have it. Metabolic Syndrome Institute web page at: http://www.metabolic-syndrome-institute.org/medical_information/mets_epidemic1374 Chai 2004.1375 In Europe, a person is considered overweight, if BMI (body mass index) is at least 25, and obese, if BMI is at least 30. The Chinese use different cut-off points for overweight and obesity. A person is considered overweight, if BMI is at least 24, and obese if BMI reaches 28.-251-is overweight1376. China faces the dual problem of malnutrition and obesity. Chronic diseases associated to obesity are increasing rapidly in China.1377 20.7 % of Chinese were overweight in 19971378. According to a 2005 study, some 18 million adults in China were obese, and 137 million were overweight1379. Abdominal fat is particularly dangerous.1380 Abdominal obesity is associated with insulin resistance and predicts the onset of type 2 diabetes. Abdominal obesity also predicts coronary artery disease, more directly than BMI (body mass index).1381Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot handle glucose (sugar). Hyperglycaemia (too much sugar in the blood) appears when pancreatic beta cells can no longer compensate insulin-resistance by increasing insulin release.1382 Type 1 and type 2 diabetes have different causes and population distributions.1383 Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented. Type 1 diabetes was traditionally called juvenile diabetes, as most children's diabetes is type 1. Here we only discuss type 2 diabetes, as it is most interesting regarding functional foods. Changes in lifestyle can delay or prevent onset of type 2 diabetes. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include, among others, obesity, low level of HDL, and high level of triglycerides in the blood.A worldwide diabetes epidemic is occurring. Around 8% of Europeans and adult Americans have diabetes1384. The cause of death for diabetics is often cardiovascular disease, for example a stroke.1385 There is no cure for diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is always treated with insulin injections, plus diet. Some people with type 2 diabetes can manage their disease with diet and exercise alone, others require medicinal treatment. Diet is important for both prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. Goals of nutritional therapy are: control of blood sugar and blood lipid levels, control of hypertension, weight loss, and improving general health. Nutritional therapy is thus similar in cases of diabetes and heart disease.In nutritional therapy, the terms glycemic index and glycemic load are important. Glycemic index ranks foods on how they affect our blood glucose levels.1386 Different carbohydrates have different glycemic responses, i.e., they have different effects on blood sugar levels. Glycemic load of a serving of food is glycemic index (%) multiplied by grams of carbohydrate per 1376 International Obesity Task Force web page at: http://www.iotf.org/database/documents/EUPresentationGraphNov06_004.ppt#1.1377 Chai 2004.1378 Chai 2004. 1379 Functional Ingredients September 2005 China News. 1380 To avoid risks associated with excess body fat, waist circumvention should not exceed 80 cm for female and 85 cm for male population.1381 Metabolic syndrome institute web page at: http://www.metabolic-syndrome-institute.org/medical_information/defi nition.1382 Metabolic syndrome institute web page at: http://www.metabolic-syndrome-institute.org/medical_information/defi nition.1383 In addition, there is gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy and typically resolves when the baby is born. Metabolic syndrome institute web page at: http://www.diabetes.org/gestational-diabetes.jsp.1384 British Heart Foundation Statistics Website at: http://www.heartstats.org/datapage.asp?id=4529.1385 Metabolic syndrome institute web page at: http://www.metabolic-syndrome-institute.org/medical_information/defi nition.1386 Glycemic index is the area under the curve of blood glucose produced by an amount of carbohydrate in a food, relative to the area produced by the same amount of carbohydrate from a standard source (usually white bread or glucose). This means products containing carbohydrates are compared to a product that affects the blood sugar levels the most.-252-serving. Epidemiological studies suggest that glycemic index and glycemic load are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. High-glycemic-load diets could increase risk of type 2 diabetes by increasing insulin demand, which could lead to beta cell exhaustion and glucose intolerance. These diets can also make the body produce counter-regulatory hormones which would increase insulin resistance, insulin demand and glucose intolerance. These mechanisms would create diabetes.Oral medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes function by increasing insulin production, decreasing blood glucose or enhancing the body's ability to use its own insulin more effectively. A drug called metmorfi n enhances insulin sensitivity.1387 Thiazolidinediones are also insulin sensitising, and may improve insulin resistance.1388Cardiovascular diseases represent today the principal cause of mortality in developed countries. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for American, European, and Chinese adults1389. The WHO presumes that CVD will become the primary cause of death worldwide by the year 2020. Prevalence of hypertension among Beijing residents aged 15-69 was 24.8% in 2001, and prevalence of coronary heart disease 7.22%. Of Beijing residents, 2.14% had had a stroke. In Shanghai, the pattern is similar. 1390 Consumption of animal-based products per capita has increased rapidly in China. It has tripled since the 60's.1391 Consumption of fat and meat continues to increase among Chinese urban citizens.1392The cardiovascular system is made up of the heart and blood vessels. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) include coronary heart disease (coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease), stroke (angina pectoris, heart attack), hypertension, and rheumatic heart disease (arrhythmia). Causes of cardiovascular disease are multiple and many lifestyle factors are related to the risk of CVD. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease are, among other things, hyperlipidemia, hypertension1393, obesity and diabetes. Hyperlipidemia means excess of certain unbenefi cial fats in the blood: LDL cholesterol1394, triglycerides and phospholipids. Hypertension is defi ned as high blood pressure.Several cardiovascular disease risk factors can be affected with diet. Goals of cardiovascular disease nutritional therapy are: to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes, and to 1387 Metabolic syndrome institute web page at: http://www.metabolic-syndrome-institute.org/medical_information/prevention_and_treatment.1388 Metabolic syndrome institute web page at: http://www.metabolic-syndrome-institute.org/medical_information/prevention_and_treatment.1389 Functional Ingredients September 2005 China News. 1390 Chai 2004.1391 Chai 2004.1392 Chinese disease patterns show different characteristics in urban vs. rural areas. The transition in urban areas from communicable to non-communicable diseases is almost complete. Heart and brain vascular diseases, cancer and diabetes are increasing rapidly. In rural areas, communicable, endemic diseases such as tuberculosis are still not under control. Chai 2004.1393 Blood pressure is high if systolic pressure is at least 140 mmHg and diastolic pressure at least 90 mmHg.1394 Excess of blood cholesterol is called hypercholesterolemia. There are two main types of blood cholesterol: LDL and HDL. LDL (low density lipoprotein) is 'bad cholesterol' and related to CVD risk. HDL (high density lipoprotein is 'good cholesterol' and inversely related to CVD risk. Reducing serum LDL cholesterol and increasing HDL cholesterol decreases risk of CVD. This is widely established.-253-maintain optimal levels of lipid profi les and blood pressure.1395 Medicinal products to tackle dyslipidaemia (wrong kind of fat in the blood) include statins and fi brates. Statins act on LDL cholesterol, and fi brates act on HDL cholesterol and triglycerides1396. Hypertension is treated with medicines such as diuretics, alpha blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, sympatholytics, and vasodilators1397.6.2.2 Use of the Berries in Traditional Chinese MedicineThe medicinal use of hawthorn has a long history.1398 In ancient times, the Chinese herbalists mainly used dried fruits of hawthorn to improve digestion. For the past thirty years, the use of hawthorn as a strengthener of the cardiovascular system has been noted and adopted by Chinese herbalists. Western applications of hawthorn have been verifi ed by Chinese researchers and added to lists of hawthorn applications in Chinese medicine. There are now several hawthorn products on the market for strengthening heart function, lowering blood lipids, and dilating blood vessels to promote blood circulation.1399According to \"The Essentials of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine\", hawthorn fruit (Fructus Crataegi, Shanzha) can promote blood circulation and release blood stasis1400. Active components include organic acids such as crataegic acid, citric acid, and caffeic acid, fl avonoids such as vitexin and quercitin, and vitamins such as vitamin C, ribofl avin, and carotenes. Hawthorn fl avonoids can increase blood fl ow in coronary blood vessels and lower blood pressure. Hawthorn fruit can also increase serum HDL cholesterol and reduce LDL cholesterol, and prevent atherosclerosis. For cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease, hawthorn fruit is used as syrup, tablet, instant power and tincture. Average dosage is 10-15grams of raw or fried fruit; a large dosage is 30grams. A warning goes as follows: \"Intake of an extra-large dosage of hawthorn may produce a sedative effect and inhibit respiration, although the drug is of low toxicity. \"1401Chinese wolfberries, also known as Goji berries, come from the Lycium barbarum plant, a vine that grows in China, Tibet and other areas of Asia. Wolfberry fruit (Fructus Lycii, Gouqizi) can, according to \"The Essentials of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine\", treat 1395 This means LDL 3.5-5 mmol /l with no specifi c goal on HDL cholesterol. Systolic blood pressure should be under 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure under 80 mmHg.1396 According to Taskinen, fi brates seem to be the optimal drug for correcting dyslipidaemia in patients with the metabolic syndrome who have low LDL-cholesterol. According to her, the management of these subjects is in clinical practice commonly neglected despite their increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Metabolic syndrome institute web page at: http://www.metabolic-syndrome-institute.org/medical_information/expert_point_of_view/taskinen.1397 Messmer 2006. 1398 Food use of hawthorn is also important. Hawthorn fruits are in China used as a food to make many kinds of snacks, for example haw fl akes, which are sold also in all the large cities in the U.S. The fruits, which are called shanzha in Chinese, are also used to produce jams, jellies, juices, tea, wine, etc. Wikipedia. Article on hawthorn. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crataegus.1399 Dharmananda. 1400 The Essentials of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine 2003, 126. Another important indication is digestion trouble. Hawthorn can promote digestion and release stagnation of food. 1401 The Essentials of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine 2003, 126-127.-254-\"diabetes mellitus with endogenous heat due to defi ciency of yin\". For this purpose, wolfberry fruit is combined with rehmannia, fi gwort root (Radix Scrophulariae, Xuanshen), Chinese yam, milkvetch root and magnoliavine fruit (Fructus Schisandrae, Wuweizi). It is stated that wolfberry fruit can apparently and persistently reduce blood sugar and lower blood pressure. Normal dosage is 5-10 grams of berries. A warning goes as follows: \"Wolfberry fruit should not be prescribed for patients with diarrhoea due to defi ciency of the spleen, because it can replenish yin and moisten dryness. \"1402Hawthorn and Chinese wolfberry are mentioned in every common book on traditional Chinese medicine. According to Cai, hawthorn is used to lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol1403, wolfberry fruit to lower blood pressure and blood sugar1404, and wolfberry root to treat high cholesterol1405. According to Zhao, hawthorn fruit is used to lower blood pressure1406, and wolfberry fruit to treat diabetes1407. According to Hou et al., hawthorn fruit is used \"to promote blood circulation and disperse blood stasis, lower blood pressure and the level of blood lipids1408\", and wolfberry to treat diabetes1409. Hawthorn is also used to treat obesity1410.Emblic leaffl ower is apparently not among the most commonly used medicinal plants, as the general Chinese books on traditional Chinese medicine do not recognise the plant. This is probably because roots of its medical use are in ancient India, where it was respected as \"Saint fruit\"1411 and because it was typically used by the Tibetan minority of China. Even today the fruit is most popular in India. The plant is, however, recorded in the Chinese pharmacopoeia. It is used, among other things, to cure \"internal heat\", \"blood heat\", \"blood disease\", and high blood pressure.14126.2.3 Scientifi c Evidence on the BerriesIt was stated above that hawthorn, emblic leaffl ower, and barbary wolfberry have potential for use in functional foods. This is not just because they are part of the above-mentioned superfruit trend, but because they actually have scientifi cally proven benefi cial effects on risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. The effects are mainly due to fl avonoids and triterpene acids in hawthorn, polysaccharides and alkaloids in barbary wolfberry, and vitamin C and tannoids in emblic leaffl ower. We will not list all the available scientifi c research on the berries, but refer to some of the latest studies that might be relevant in supporting health claims on our functional foods.Hawthorn fruit has been found to have:1402 The Essentials of Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine 2003, 254-255.1403 Cai 1993, 107.1404 Cai 1993, 102.1405 Cai 1993, 71. 1406 Zhao 1996, 85.1407 Zhao 1996, 79. 1408 Hou 1994, 61. 1409 Hou 1994, 71.1410 Hou 1994, 142.1411 Yalin Health company web page at: http://www.yalin-health.com/en/info/index.asp?id=5.1412 Yalin Health company web page at: http://www.yalin-health.com/en/info/index.asp?id=5.-255-hypolipidemic activity - 1413,positive effects on arteries and coronary fl ow - 1414,positive effects on blood pressure - 1415, andantioxidant activity - 1416.Emblic leaffl ower fruit has been found to have:hypoglycemic activity - 1417,hypolipidemic activity - 1418,cardioprotective effects - 1419, andantioxidant activity - 1420.Chinese wolfberry fruit has been found to have:hypoglycemic activity - 1421,hypolipidemic activity - 1422, andantioxidant activity - 1423.1424Hypoglycaemic is something that lowers the level of sugars in the blood. Something that is hypolipidemic lowers the level of lipids. Antioxidants protect cells from damage. The berries could be used in functional foods as such (dried), or their active ingredients could be captured. Some of the more technological options for functional foods are:oils, -\"phenolic fractions\", and -glycoconjugates (barbary wolfberry). -6.3 Which Rules to Follow?In chapter 2, we have discussed the European and Chinese legal systems on foodstuffs and medicines from regulators to implementing agencies. Norms on several levels and of several types are relevant to legal evaluation of our functional food products.1413 Xiong et al. 2004. Chen et al. 2002.1414 Pittler et al. 2008.
