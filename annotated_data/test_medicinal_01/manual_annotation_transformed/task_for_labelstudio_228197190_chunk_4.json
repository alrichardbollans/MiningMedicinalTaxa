The influx continued until restrictions were set by the Commonwealth Immigrants Act of 1962 (Healy and Aslam, 1989). During the British reign in India between 1858 and 1947 many Indians were educated or trained and taken to other countries to work in British colonies. Indians were used to work in clerical, manual labour and farming roles. Thirty two thousand Indians were taken to Southeast Africa under indentured labour contracts to build the Uganda railway networks (Kasozi et al., 1994). When East African Governments created polices to prevent British passport holders from working, many Asians who had settled there were left unemployed (Healy and Aslam, 1989). On the 4th August 1972 the president of Uganda, Idi Amin, declared that all Asians would be expelled from Uganda within ninety days. At the time of expulsion there were seventy five thousand Asians living in Uganda. Many held British passports so were able to immigrate to the UK (Kasozi et al., 1994). These immigrants were mostly of Gujarati origin and they settled around Leicester and London; they were better educated and many had successful businesses (Hanif and Karamat, 2009). According to Healy and Aslam (1989) the main types of Asians found in the UK can be categorised as Punjabi, Gujarati, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and those East African Asians usually of Punjabi or Gujarati origin from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and to a lesser extent Malawi or Zambia. The SA population in the UK can be described as being heterogeneous due to the variety of religions, cultures, languages, social and economic backgrounds (Gill and Lloyd, 2009; Hanif and Karamat, 2009). 18 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Diaspora comes from the Greek word (diaspora) which means to disperse, scatter or spread. Brown (2006) uses the word diaspora to refer to groups of people with a common ethnicity who have left their original homeland but retained a cultural kinship. Although South Asia includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, when referring to SA diasporic communities in this study it will focus on Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities as agreed by most official and research bodies (Khunti et al., 2009; Office for National Statistics, 2012). UK Census Statistics The 1991 Census was the first to account for ethnic minorities in the UK (Ballard, 2004). The SA ethnic minority encompassed Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. Of the total population 5.5% was identified as ethnic minority of which half was of SA origin (Brown, 2006). The total SA population in the UK has continued to rise from 3.9% in 2001 to 5.3% in 2011; Figure 2-2 illustrates the changes in SA ethnic groups in the UK between 2001 and 2011 (Office for National Statistics, 2012). The Census data reveals that SAs live in all areas of the UK, clustering in certain areas reflecting migration patterns (Figure 2-3). For example, there is a high concentration of Indians and Bangladeshis residing in Greater London as well as the East and West Midlands; while, Pakistanis can be found predominantly in West Yorkshire, Manchester and the Midlands (Gill and Lloyd, 2009; Hanif and Karamat, 2009). 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0Indian Pakistani BangladeshiPopulation %South Asian Population In the UK20012011Figure 2-2 South Asian Ethnic Groups in the UK 2001 - 2011 (adapted from Office for National Statistics, 2012) 19 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.4.2 South Asian Traditional Medicine South Asian countries have a heritage of traditional herbal medicine; Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani are systems of traditional medicine (TM) native to SAs. Ayurveda is one of India's most well-known systems of TM which has hundreds of formulations; it was first documented in the Rig Veda around 1500 BC. Siddha is said to be the oldest system of medicine known, dating back over ten thousand years; it is another branch of traditional Indian medicine originating from South India. A newer concept was introduced around 1025 AD, by the Muslim herbalist Ibn Sina (more commonly known in the West as Avicenna), who took his inspiration from Greek and Islamic medicines to create Unani (Lone et al., 2012; Ansari and Satish, 2013). Ayurveda Ayurveda translates as 'the knowledge of life' and is the holistic approach to traditional Indian herbal medicine; encompassing the use of HMs, breathing techniques, meditation, yoga and exercise as a complete system of managing health and preventing disease (Williamson, 2002). Ayurveda is believed to have originated from the Hindu God, Lord Brahma, known as the creator of the universe (Nerkar, 2007). It is thought to be one of the oldest systems of TM, which was developed more than five-thousand years ago; when the wise men known as 'rishis', were thought to have retreated to the Himalayas to meditate to gain divine knowledge from Lord Brahma, about how to tackle diseases (Nerkar, 2007). Figure 2-3 Distribution of Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi Communities in the UK (adapted from Office for National Statistics, Census 2011) Indian Pakistani Bangladeshi 20 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Their enlightenment was transcribed into Vedas which are Hindu scriptures, still referred to today. There are four Vedas in Hinduism; Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samveda and Atharvaveda which contain herbal remedies and cures for diseases. The principles of Ayurveda originate from the first of the four scriptures known as the Rigveda. The Rigveda describes how the universe is made from five elements known as the Pancha Mehabhutas; space (Aksha), air (Vayu), fire (Teja), water (Aap) and earth (Prithi). In different combinations these elements make three forces: vata, pitta and kapha, which compose the human body and are known as the tridosha (Patwardhan et al., 2005). Williamson (2002) recognised that modern science has been able to interpret the three components of the tridosha as different systems within the body. Vata is equivalent to the central nervous system which regulates breathing, heart rate, and movement. Pitta represents the endocrine system and is involved in thermogenesis, digestion, and energy production. While the kapha corresponds to the immune system, providing protection to the body and wound healing. Disease occurs when components of the tridosha become imbalanced. For instance altered metabolism due to pitta imbalance links to thyroid gland malfunction (Godagama, 2001; Williamson, 2002; Patwardhan et al., 2005). Ayurveda focuses on maintaining good health and making the body more resistant to illness and disease; equal importance is also given to the treatment of disease (Vishnuprasad et al., 2013). Ayurvedic practice takes into consideration individual differences and the treatment is tailored (Godagama, 2001). Ayurvedic medicinal plants have already provided the Western world with several active molecules for treating an array of conditions including: curcumins for inflammation, and guggulsterone for hyperlipidaemia (Patwardhan, 2000). Approximately six hundred plants are described in the Ayurvedic Matria Medica (Dash and Kashyap, 1980). Ayurvedic medicinal plants are attached to five key aspects; identification (ensuring the correct species is used is of paramount importance), cultivation, harvest, storage and usage; these factors can ultimately affect the activity, effect, and potency of the remedy (Godagama, 2001). The distinctive details outlining the selection and use of plants in Ayurveda ensures the correct plants are selected for the appropriate use; an innate system for controlling production of herbal remedies. Within Ayurveda, plants are formulated into polyherbal mixtures known as 'rasayana'. A common Ayurvedic mixture is Chyawanprash, believed to replenish the bodies' nutrients, containing a combination of over forty natural herbs including: amla (Indian gooseberry), cinnamon, clove, turmeric, asparagus and beetroot; according to Dabur Research Foundation (1991), the market leader of Chyawanprash sales, this blend of herbs which has been used for over two and a half thousand years, has antioxidant properties and helps strengthen the 21 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra immune system. Triphala is another common rasayana, consisting of three fruits: amla (Phyllanthus emblica L. Indian gooseberry), beleric (Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb bastard myrobalan), and harad (Terminalia chebula Retx. black myrobalan). This formulation has been used to treat numerous ailments including digestive problems, constipation, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (Ponnusankar et al., 2011). In the sixteenth century during the colonization of India by the British, the traditional form of medicine was deemed backward and inferior and was gradually succeeded by Western medicine (Dash and Kashyap, 1980). Modern Western medicine was not accessible to all, it was expensive and difficult for those in rural areas to access; hence, in remote villages Ayurvedic traditions continued to thrive. Traditional doctors preserved the practices of prescribing and dispensing HMs. In 1980 the National Congress of India decided Ayurveda should be regulated just like Western medicine so institutes for training Ayurvedic practitioners were introduced (Godagama, 2001). In the late 1980's Ayurvedic remedies were being used in Western countries. In India, Ayurveda remains as the system for primary health care, and interest across the world is growing (Sharm et al., 2007; Lallanila, 2015). Yumi et al. (2008) suggest the reason why Ayurveda is becoming more popular in Western communities is due to the increased rates of immigration of Asians from India. This is supported by Sandhu and Heinrich (2005) who also found that immigrants brought their traditional forms of herbal medicine with them. Siddha Siddha is another branch of traditional Indian medicine which is believed to have originated more than ten thousand years ago. The Siddha scriptures are written in Tamil; hence, are predominantly used by people of Tamil origin (Krishnamurthy and Mouli, 1984). One of the distinctions made between Ayurveda and Siddha is that, Ayurveda is generally used more by people from the north of India and Kerala, while Siddha remains prevalent amongst those further South in Tamil Nadu (Zysk, 2008). Siddha healers still play an important role in rural health care (Pandikumar et al., 2011). Legend has it that Siddha was created by the Hindu God, Lord Shiva, who passed the knowledge of medicine to the saints known as Siddhars. There were eighteen Siddhars - men who had achieved supernatural abilities, which enabled them to heal the sick, through their spirituality and meditation. These saints were believed to be able to cure any illness by utilising their divine knowledge to produce medicines from plants. Siddha takes into account 22 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra the individuals' disease; considering the persons symptoms, age, gender and environmental factors to produce a holistic treatment. The tongue, eyes, pulse, and urine are all assessed to determine the type of imbalance and to formulate the appropriate treatment (AYUSH, 2012). There are several similarities between Ayurveda and Siddha. For example, the five elements which create the body: earth, water, fire, air and space which must be balanced. The concept of the three humours (Tamil: tiritocam, Sanskrit: tridosha) representing the wind (vata), bile (pitta) and phlegm (kapha) are also the same (Godagama, 2001; Zysk, 2008). The majority of the plants are used for similar conditions; some of the common examples include ginger for digestive complaints, tulsi for skin conditions, and garlic as an antibacterial (Chellappandian et al., 2012). The key differences recognised are that Siddha relies heavily on astrology to decide the appropriate treatment regime. The formulation process of medicines is deemed highly significant for example: the part of the plant used, the direction the sun penetrates the plant and the harvesting are all carefully regulated by the Siddha practitioners; deviations are believed to distort the effectiveness of treatment (Kumar et al., 2013). Ultimately both Ayurveda and Siddha provide a holistic system of healthcare; providing a path for life, promoting resilience to disease, and treatment for illness. Siddha remains the primary health care regime for the majority of South Indians in Tamil Nadu; and is also practiced in Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia (Chellappandian et al., 2012). Although modern medicine may be available across India, these systems of TM continue to thrive. Historical, cultural, and ecological factors could all contribute to the continued use of TM not only in India, but around the world (Kunwar et al., 2010; Pandikumar et al., 2011). Unani Unani is a newer form of TM, in contrast to Ayurveda and Siddha. Adopted by the Arabs, from the teachings of the ancient Greek and Roman philosopher-physicians Hippocrates and Galen. Having emerged over two thousand years ago (Lone et al., 2012), it incorporates traditional herbal remedies from several countries, including: India, China, Egypt, Persia, and many other Middle Eastern countries (AYUSH, 2012). The system was introduced to India by the Arabs, and used predominately by Muslims who lived there (Zysk, 2008). During the British rule, as with all the other forms of TM, Unani was deemed inferior and the availability of Western medicines surpassed the Unani system of healthcare. According to Unani principles, disease occurs as a natural process. The system is based on Hippocrates' Humoral Theory; this suggests there are four humours in the body - phlegm 23 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra (balgham), blood (dam), yellow bile (safra) and black bile (sauda). Every individual has their own unique humoral constitution; therefore, treatment has to be formulated specifically once the correct diagnosis is made. Pulse (nubz) measurement is the most common method for diagnosis, as well as examination of urine and stools (AYUSH, 2012). Unani recognises that social, economic, political, and environmental factors can affect an individual's health; reinforcing the importance of health promotion through adequate education, lifestyle and behavioural modifications (Husain et al., 2010; Lone et al., 2012). Unani offers a variety of ways of treating disease; regimental therapy, one of the most popular methods of treatment, includes: massage, exercise, diuretics and emesis, to rid the body of impurities. Diet therapy involves controlling food intake, food should be clean and fresh to prevent disease onset. Pharmacotherapy entails the use of naturally occurring medicines, and surgery - physically correcting abnormalities (AYUSH, 2012; Lone et al., 2012). One of the most common products used in Unani is black cumin (Nigella sativa L. English: small fennel, black seed, Sanskrit: kala jeera, Arabic: Habbatul barak). Seeds from the plant which is native to the Middle East and Southwest Asia are believed to be the remedy for all ailments (Tariq, 2008; Ansari and Satish, 2013). As defined by Islamic beliefs, it is said the Prophet Mohammed described the healing powers of black seed, as being able to cure any disease but death (Ansari and Satish, 2013). It is used for numerous health problems including: headache, cough, asthma, pain, rheumatism, diabetes, and many other conditions (Gali-Muhtasib et al., 2006; Tariq, 2008). The anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and analgesic effects are being widely investigated by researchers (Al-Ghamdi, 2001). Thymoquinone is one of the active compounds known to have several health benefits, including analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects (Gali-Muhtasib et al., 2006; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2007). Pharmacological and toxicological investigations have shown that some of the active compounds extracted have hepatoprotective and nephroprotective effects (Ali and Blunden, 2003). The seeds can be eaten whole, the oil extracts can be applied to the skin or mixed with other ingredients to formulate a herbal concoction. The versatility, availability, and religious significance attached to this aromatic seed means it is often consumed daily, especially by the Muslim population (Ansari and Satish, 2013). Like the other forms of traditional medicine discussed, Unani medicines have been used for centuries without real scientific validation. More research into the HMs recommended by Unani is required to investigate the safety and efficacy of this traditional medical system. 24 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.4.3 Evidence To Support the Use of Traditional Herbal Medicines Traditional plant based remedies may be preferred to synthetic alternatives as they have been considered to be relatively safer, with better therapeutic effects, less side effects, more affordable, and easily obtainable (Ayyanar and Ignacimuthu, 2011). Hatfield (2007) states, \"Man's use of plants may be viewed as a long standing clinical trial; remedies that have stood the test of time are likely to be worth further investigation.\" Although there may not be much scientific evidence to prove the efficacy of HMs, some researchers claim the fact that they have been used for so long can be used to validate their use (Pandikumar et al., 2011). Despite the long standing use of HMs, a shift towards evidence based medicine, and scientific validation is prompting more research into HMs. Two commonly used examples which have now been researched extensively are turmeric and garlic."
