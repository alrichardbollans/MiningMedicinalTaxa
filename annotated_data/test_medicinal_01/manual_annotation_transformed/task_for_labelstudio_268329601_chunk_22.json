      "text": "The progenitors of the other cereals arebasically the same in general appearance as theirmodern derivatives. Maize is strikingly distinct. Andthird, maize is unique among the major cereals inhaving separate male and female flowers borne onentirely different parts of the plant. The male flowersare found on the branches of the tassel, while thefemale flowers are clustered in the ear, the complexfruiting structure that bears an even number of rowsof caryopses, or kernels as they are commonly called.Maize has many uses. In this country, about 90% ofthe crop goes into livestock food. In many othercountries, maize is a very important food for humans.It is inferior to wheat and to some other cereals in itsprotein content. This means that maize flour productsare less tasty than those made from rye or wheat.Maize flour, however, has been the mainstay of manypeoples in Central and South America. Hominy isdried, hulled maize kernels that are cooked in variousways. The word comes from the Algonquian language.Hominy was one of the first Native American foodsthat was accepted by the early European settlers inthe 17th century. Lime (the mineral, not the fruit) orlye (from wood ash) is used to help loosen the hulls.Grits is made from finely ground hominy. It issometimes called hominy grits. Look for it south of theMason and Dixon Line. I discovered many years agoon my first collecting trip into the South that gritswere served with just about anything that youordered, especially for breakfast.Other important products from maize include cornstarch, corn oil, alcoholic beverages, and silage. Asone author noted, maize is with us from cradle tograve - literally. It is in baby powder and in embalming fluid!TYPES OF MAIZEThere are six main types of maize in use today:flint: kernel made of hard starch; in use by NativeAmericans at the time of Columbus; widely used in thenorthern corn belt;dent: kernel of hard starch, capped by soft starchthat dries to leave a small depression in the top of thegrain; economically the most important maize; muchused in the corn belt;flour: kernel consists almost entirely of soft starch;used by the Native Americans of the Southwest andthose in South America for hand grinding;sweet: kernels with high sugar content, consumedwhile immature; most widely grown for humanconsumption here and in Europe;pop: kernels lacking soft starch, cells burst uponheating because of high water content of central cells;related to flint corn;pod: peculiar type with comparatively little economicimportance; kernel enclosed by bracts; considered bysome to be the ancestor of modern maize.THE RELATIVES OF MAIZEMaize has two close relatives -- gama grass andteosinte. There are about seven species of gamagrasses (Tripsacum spp. ), found from the centralportion of the U. S. to southern Brazil. All of them areperennials. The male and female flowers are separatefrom one another, as in maize, but they are not in thetassel and ear configuration.There are three kinds of teosinte, all occurring inMexico and Central America. Traditionally, teosintehas been placed in its own genus (Euchlaena), but inmore recent works the species have been put in Zea.The male flowers are borne in a tassel at the top ofthe plant; the female flowers are borne on a spike on-73-the lower parts of the plant.THE ORIGIN OF MODERN MAIZEFor much of the last century, the identity of the grassthat gave rise to maize has been the subject of muchcontroversy. Most of the botanists and geneticist whostudied the matter belonged to one of two camps.They are either teosinte people, followers of GeorgeBeadle, or pod corn people, followers of PaulMangelsdorf and Richard Reeves. Those who believethat teosinte was the ancestor of modern maize pointout how easily it can be crossed with maize. They notethat the conversion of the hard bracts surrounding thegrains on the teosinte \"ear\" into soft structures wouldproduce a maize-like ear. Hugh Iltis, a botanist at theUniv. of Wisconsin, has suggested that it was theconversion of male flowers, with their softer bracts,that was actually involved.The more widely held view was that modern maizeoriginated from a wild form of pod corn and that thevariety that we see today in maize is the result of pasthybridization between Zea and Tripsacum, the gamagrasses. According to the \"Pod Corn Theory,\" teosinteis not a maize ancestor at all, but the result of naturalcrosses between maize and gama grasses.The results of the archeological, botanical, and geneticresearch into the origin of maize suggest thefollowing:' Maize is native to the New World, moreparticularly to Mesoamerica. Reports of Pre-Columbian maize from the Old World have notbeen substantiated.' Domestication of maize began about 10,000 BP.' The ancestor of maize is teosinte, its closestrelative.' Teosinte is not a hybrid of maize and gama grass.' Gama grass may have crossed with someprimitive forms of maize and thereby contributedto the evolution of modern kinds of maize.' Primitive maize became extinct because it couldnot compete against more successful cultivatedforms and perhaps because of the introduction ofgrazing animals by the Spanish after theConquest.The Beadle school won and the pod corn people, thefollowers of Paul Mangelsdorf, lost the long battle. Hewas generous in defeat.HYBRID MAIZEOne of the great developments in modern agriculturalgenetics is hybrid corn. The basic principle behindhybrid corn is that stable inbred lines can be crossedwith one another to produce more uniform plants withhigher yields. Modern hybrid corn involves a doublecrossing. During the first year, inbred strain A iscrossed with B. Self-pollination is prevented duringthese crosses by removing the male flowers from onestrain (detasseling), thereby rendering the plantseffectively female. In separate fields, strains C and Dare similarly crossed. The seeds from the A x B andfrom the C x D crosses are planted. These mature intoAB and CD individuals. These are then crossed duringthe second year, yielding the double cross ABCDhybrid seed. It is planted the third year to producetremendous yields of high-quality seed. The ABCDseed is not true-breeding and must, therefore, bepurchased regularly.CYTOPLASMIC MALE STERILITYIn 1938, Paul Mangelsdorf, a Harvard botanist whodevoted his life to the study of maize, discovered asweet corn variety in Texas that was male sterile. Themale flowers of its tassel had shriveled anthers thatdid not produce fertile pollen grains. Investigation ofthis plant revealed that the sterility was under geneticcontrol, as opposed to some short-lived environmentalproblem, such as drought. Sterile sex cells typicallyresult from chromosomal abnormalities, either in theirnumber or structure. However, in this case the cornplant produced sterile pollen when a sterility factor [S]in the cytoplasm of the cell was present at the sametime that it had a double recessive gene [rf] in itsnucleus. This same kind of phenomenon was firstfound in onions, and is now known to occur in severalcrop plants. One possible explanation is that thecytoplasmic sterility is caused by viruses that cansurvive only if the rf rf condition exists. If the gene ispresent in the Rf state, fertility is restored. Cytoplasmwithout the sterility factor is designated N, for\"normal.\" The cytoplasmic factor passes from onegeneration to the next only via the egg.Therefore, by using an inbred line that contains the Srf rf genetic combination, male sterile plants areproduced. The corn plants are rendered functionallyfemale. The difficulty in finding enough workers andtheir cost made the male-sterile strains a veryattractive alternative to manual detasseling. Withintwenty years, practically all of the maize grown in theUnited States incorporated the male sterility factorfirst found in the Texas corn plants. Once again we had made one of our major crop plantsmore genetically similar to one another, with all of theadvantages and disadvantages associated with thatuniformity. The bill came due in the summer of 1970.Our corn fields were invaded by a fungus(Helminthosporium maydis), which causes thesouthern leaf blight. The disease spread rapidly,moving from Florida northward at about 150 km perday. By the end of the summer, the blight hadcovered much of the eastern and central UnitedStates. It devastated the Texas male-sterile hybrids,causing more than a $1 billion loss in the corn crop. \"JUMPING GENES\"James Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize withFrancis Crick for their discovery of the structure ofDNA, said, \"There are really three main figures in thehistory of genetics -- the three M's: Mendel, Morgan,and McClintock.\" Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884),an Austrian monk, is often called the father ofgenetics. His work on the changes that he observedfrom one generation to the next in pea plants that hegrew in the monastery garden is well known -- astandard fixture in all highschool and college texts inbiology and genetics. Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866-1945), of Columbia University, along with his wife(Lillian) and his students did research on the fruit fly(Drosophila melanogaster). His lab was the first toshow that genes were located on chromosomes in thecell nucleus, that genes were located at specific siteson a chromosome, and that traits were passed fromparent to offspring through genes. Morgan won theNobel Prize in 1933 for these fundamental discoveries.The third \"M\" is Barbara McClintock (1902-1992). Sheearned her bachelor's degree in botany from CornellUniversity, where she was also awarded her master's-74-and doctorate. In 1931, McClintock identified the tenchromosomes of maize, and she co-authored with Harriet Creighton the first paper to describe thegenetic phenomenon of crossing-over. In 1944,McClintock identified the seven chromosomes of thebread mold, Neurospora, and began her research onmobile genes and controlling elements in maize. Shehad observed that some plants have leaves withdifferent patterns of pigment in them. In maize, somekernels were white, some solid purple, and some hadspeckles of purple on otherwise white kernels.After years of detailed study, McClintock developed atheory to explain what she had seen. The differencesin pigmentation of corn kernels was caused by somegenes moving from one site on a chromosome toanother location, or from one chromosome to another.Further, it appeared to her that other genes acted asswitches that turn a gene on and off during plantdevelopment. McClintock presented the results of herwork in 1951 at a Cold Spring Harbor Symposium. Thereaction was mixed. Most of her colleagues failed tounderstand her work, others rejected it outright, andothers thought that poor Barbara had been out in thesun too long playing with her corn plants. One said,that \"... he had never heard anything as ridiculous. \"Another, \"I understand that you're doing somethingthat's very strange. I don't want to hear a word aboutit.\" At the other end of the spectrum, thedistinguished Caltech geneticist Alfred Sturtevant said,\"I didn't understand one word she said, but if she saysit is so, it must be so! \"What Barbara McClintock had proposed was heresy!Everyone knew that a chromosome was like anecklace and the beads were genes. This bead isalways next to that bead in a necklace; this gene isalways next to that gene on a chromosome. And shewas saying that it ain't necessarily so. In her nowclassic paper, McClintock concluded that the bestexplanation for what she was seeing was that a genedid, in fact, actually move from one site on achromosome to the site of the gene that controlledpigment color. She called it Ds, the dissociator gene.Ds would instruct the color gene. The Ds gene, inturn, was controlled by an activator, Ac.McClintock called these mobile genetic unitstransposons. Time Magazine called them \"jumpinggenes.\" It explained McClintock's theory in terms ofthree characters -- a painter, a boss, and a policeman.The painter is the structural gene that makes a kernelhave a particular color. The boss (Ds or dissociatorgene) can tell the painter to paint or not to paint. Theboss must follow the directions of the police officer (Acor activator gene), who can tell the boss to let thepainter do his job or not. The officer can tell the bossto have the painter stop and then later resumepainting. Depending on the interaction of the painter,boss, and policeman, the kernel will be pigmented,speckled, or colorless.On 10 October 1983, McClintock learned from theradio that she had won the Nobel Prize in Physiologyor Medicine. The folks in Stockholm had tried to callher at home, but she didn't have a telephone. She,Marie Curie in 1911, and Dorothy Hodgkin in 1964 arethe only three women to receive an unshared Nobel inany field.McClintock's long-time friend and champion, MarcusRhoades, said of her work:\"One of the remarkable things about BarbaraMcClintock's surpassingly beautiful investigations isthat they came solely from her own labors. Withouttechnical help of any kind she has by virtue of herboundless energy, her complete devotion to science,her originality and ingenuity, and her quick and highintelligence made a series of significant discoveriesunparalleled in the history of cytogenetics. A skilledexperimentalist, a master at interpreting cytologicaldetail, a brilliant theoretician, she has had anilluminating and pervasive role in the development ofcytology and genetics. \"Transposable elements have since been found in manyplants and animals. They are best known in maize,fruit flies, yeasts, and humans.5.6 ! MINOR CEREALSBy convention, any true cereal other than wheat, rice,or maize is called a minor cereal. Many of them areunfamiliar to people who live outside the tropics, butin those regions they are very important food plantsfor us and for our animals.BARLEY. Hordeum vulgare is the fourth leadingcereal, in terms of world-wide production. Along withwheat, it was one of the first plants that wedomesticated. All of the cultivated species are diploids(2n = 2x = 14). Barley differs from wheat, maize, andrice in having three spikelets per node. If all threedevelop, the spike has the appearance of having sixrows of grains, three on each side (the 6-rowedbarleys); if the two lateral spikelets are rudimentary,then the spike appears to have two rows of spikelets(the 2-rowed barleys). The two bracts immediatelysurrounding the grain are fused to it. The grain ispearled, rubbed against abrasive disks to remove thehulls and some of the outer layers of the grain, duringthe processing for human consumption. The chief useof barley is as animal food. It is a relativelyunimportant food for humans. About one-third of thecrop is used for making malt used in brewing,flavoring, cereals, icings, coffee substitutes, infantfoods, flours, medicinal syrups, candies, and industrialfermentations.RYE. Secale cereale is a plant of cool, non-humidregions. It is grown chiefly in northern Europe. In theU. S., North and South Dakota and Nebraska grow themost rye. The species is diploid (2n = 2x = 14). It isnow unknown in the wild. Most rye is fed to cattle. Weuse it to make flour for \"rye bread\" or the famousblackbread (Schwartzbrot) of Germany, Poland, andRussia. Most of our U. S. ryebread has a very highwheat flour content. Rye is also used to make whiskyand industrial alcohol.Ergot (Claviceps purpurea) is an important fungalparasite of rye. It causes tremendous crop losses andpoisoning in both cattle and humans. More on thatsubject when we get to medicinal plants.SORGHUM. The U. S. is the leading producer ofSorghum bicolor. The species is believed to be Asianor African in origin. Sorghum was introduced into theU. S. in the mid-1800's. The grains are small anddifficult to process. We use the various species mostlyfor forage and silage, but in the Old World the grainsare often eaten like rice or made into an unleavenedbread. All of the speciesof the genus are diploids (2n= 2x = 40), except Johnson grass, a very aggressivetetraploid weed. -75-There are four commonly recognized groups ofsorghum species, based upon their use:' syrup or sorgos, whose stem juices areabundant and sweet;' broom-corn, used to make old-stylebrooms;' grain sorghums, such as kaffir, milo, anddurra; and ' grass sorghums, such as Sudan grass,Tunis grass, and Johnson grass, grown forforage and silage.OATS. The origin of Avena sativa is still obscure.There are few references to it in the ancient literature;none, for instance, in the Hebrew Bible. It may havebecome domesticated in the cultivated fields of barleyor of some other crop. It is now grown in temperateregions, chiefly of Europe and North America. TheUSSR is the leading producer. As in wheat, there arediploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid oats. We use thehexaploids more than the others.USEFUL SPECIES OF OATSScientific (Common) Name Genome(s)Diploids [2n = 2x = 14]:A. brevis (slender oat) AAA. strigosa (sand oat) AsAsA. nuda (naked oat) AATetraploids [2n = 4x = 28]:A. barbata (slender oat) AABBA. abyssinica (Abyssinian oat) AABBA."
