      "text": "Modernisation and its side effects - an inquiry into the revival and renaissance of herbal medicine in Vietnam and Britain A thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy Ayo Wahlberg Department of Sociology London School of Economics and Political Science October 2006 2 3 For the Willamos & the Wahlbergs 4 Abstract Herbal medicine has experienced tangible revivals in both Vietnam and the United Kingdom since the mid-20th century, as reflected in sales of herbal medicinal products, numbers of users and the availability of training opportunities for aspiring herbalists. In both countries, this revival came on the back of more or less concerted official efforts to discourage and even ban the practice and use of herbal medicine, by colonial authorities (in Vietnam) or professional medical associations and regulatory bodies (in the UK). Utilising archaeological and genealogical methods as developed by Canguilhem, Foucault and others, this study seeks to account for these revivals by pursuing three particular lines of analysis. Firstly, by describing the formations of power-knowledge relations which have allowed Vietnamese and British herbal medicine to challenge biomedical monopolies in the latter half of the 20th century, it is argued that the ways in which 'quackery' is conceptualised and regulated against in both countries today, has undergone substantial transformations. Secondly, by identifying the techniques of truth making which either suggest or contest a superior efficacy (over placebo) for two particular herbal medicines in the treatment of depression (in the UK) and addiction (in Vietnam), the study demonstrates how the concept of 'efficacy' not only pertains to bio-physiological effects but also to the symbolic effects of the treatments in question. Finally, by asking what kind of 'life' herbal medicine is seen to be affecting, it is suggested that longevity has been joined by quality of life as a separate, yet inherently interlinked, therapeutic site. One of the key conclusions of the dissertation is, that the sub-disciplines of medical anthropology and sociology have played a crucial role in the 20th century births of 'traditional medicine' and 'complementary and alternative medicine' (as opposed to 'primitive' and 'fringe' medicine). Firstly, in diagnosing a 'crisis of modern medicine' by highlighting its dehumanising and toxifying effects, and secondly, in providing a theory of symbolic efficacy which could help explain the continued importance of what had in the past been written off as 'esoteric' or 'backward' healing practices. As a consequence, the study describes how an ongoing governmentalisation of human subjectivities has been a requisite side effect of modernisation in the recent revival and renaissance of herbal medicine in Vietnam and the United Kingdom. 5 Table of contents ABSTRACT .................................................................................................................... 4 LIST OF TABLES AND PLATES ............................................................................... 6 ACRONYMS................................................................................................................... 7 PREFACE - KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE......................................................... 8 1 MODERN FAILURES, TRADITIONAL REMEDIES........................................ 14 2 HISTORIES OF THE PRESENT........................................................................... 41 3 TRANSFORMATIONS IN QUACKERY ............................................................. 60 4 BIO-POLITICS AND THE NORMALISATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE... 87 5 ABOVE AND BEYOND SUPERSTITION ......................................................... 119 6 PATHWAYS TO PLAUSIBILITY....................................................................... 159 7 PETTY ENGINEERS OF MODERN LIFE ........................................................ 190 8 CONCLUSION ....................................................................................................... 223 REFERENCES ........................................................................................................... 237 6 List of tables and plates TABLE 1: CAM HIERARCHIES ..........................................................77 TABLE 2: LEVELS OF EVIDENCE ......................................................142 TABLE 3: RATING SCALES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA USED IN SJW TRIALS .............................................................................153 TABLE 4: LOG FOR MONITORING EFFECTS OF ST.

Addiction? Yes... Vietnam... Yes... Well, that sounds pretty amazing, how much do we know? Really? Yes, let me call you back.\" A Master's student at the time, I was working a few days a week as an assistant in the information unit of a UN development agency in Copenhagen. My boss called me into her office where she had just finished the telephone conversation I had overheard. I was asked if I wanted to go to Hanoi a few months later in August. The Vietnamese government and the UN Development Programme were about to sign a three-year agreement in June of 1997 for a project on the \"International Scientific Development of the Anti-Drug Medication Heantos\". This was a story that would sell itself and the idea was to invite a group of European journalists to meet with the herbalists, scientists, doctors, UN officials and government representatives who had made the project possible. In the field of international development, most stories have to do with a one-way flow of resources, technology, know-how and humanitarian aid from industrialised to developing countries. Here was a story that turned the tables, a herbal remedy from a developing country which could potentially help the industrialised West with one of its fastest growing scourges, namely drug addiction. Before boarding my return flight back home from Hanoi, I bought myself a copy of the 22 September 1997 issue of Time magazine to help pass the hours. A full-page article in the health section was asking whether St. John's Wort, a folk remedy made from the plant hypericum perforatum, was \"Nature's Prozac?\". Apparently a string of recent clinical trials and pharmacological experiments in Germany were suggesting exactly that, with European sales skyrocketing as a result. I was otherwise busy finalising a degree in social science and international development studies in the middle of a field some thirty kilometres west of Copenhagen. The development studies course at Roskilde University was consistently overbooked. Most of us had travelled the world many times over, enough to realise how much of a luxury shoestring travel was when compared to the misery of the lives of the majority in many of the countries we had travelled in. We were convinced that the time was indeed ripe for alternative thinking in development studies as a new millennium approached; the World Bank, the WTO, the WHO and other international agencies had got it all wrong. An 9 alternative development was needed or even better, alternatives to development. Resistance, emancipation and the subaltern were the orders of the day. At the same time, a few of us at the institute began wondering how we could be so sure in our convictions. Post-lecture discussions turned into weekly 'grid sessions', as we called them. Rather than approach underdevelopment as some kind of ontological state or condition (of a continent, country or community), we learned to ask how we might approach it as a problem. What was it that made the alternative so compelling in attempts to address this problem? It was an approach I would pursue intensely in a Master's thesis about alternative development and one that I continue to pursue with equal intensity in the chapters that follow about alternative medicine. Since the summer of 1997, I have returned to Hanoi for extended stays on three occasions, twice to work as an intern at the Institute of Chemistry (in 1998 and 1999) where herbalists and scientists have been working to further develop Heantos for a decade now, and most recently in the fall of 2004 to do some follow-up fieldwork for this current study. During these stays I had the opportunity to travel throughout the north of Vietnam, meeting and learning from traditional practitioners, users of herbal medicine, doctors, government officials, UN agency representatives and local members of the Communist party in the many towns I visited. I had the chance to visit remote villages where opium cultivation and use have been a practice for centuries, to drive along the treacherously winding roads favoured by traffickers of opium resin, to talk with the addicts whose demographics neatly match the traffickers' routes, and to witness the treatment of addicts with Heantos and other forms of treatment in rehabilitation centres usually located on the fringes of towns and cities. In Hanoi, I spent many hours in the laboratories of the Institute of Chemistry, also visiting institutes of Drug Quality Control, Materia Medica and Traditional Medicine. In the United Kingdom (the second empirical site of my study), I have been closely following debates over complementary and alternative medicines since November 2000 when a research visit of mine to the British Library happened to coincide with the publishing of a controversial House of Lords Select Committee report on the growing use of CAM therapies in the UK (I recall an editorial in the Guardian asking \"Con or cure?\"). This task has been facilitated by my move to London in the fall of 2003 to commence work on this dissertation. Based in London, I have had the chance to explore the many different features of an urbanised herbal medicine which, in contrast to almost universal usage in 10 Vietnam, is very much a minority medicine. This has included forays into the Holland & Barrett outlets that stock natural remedies, bookshops that supply self-medicating herbal medicine users with guides and tips, and internet community sites where sufferers of depression exchange their experiences with St. John's Wort. I have also had the opportunity to speak with practitioners of western herbal medicine in the United Kingdom about ongoing efforts to professionalise their trade and to industrialise their remedies. As it happened, my interest in Heantos and St. John's Wort took me to numerous laboratories and clinics throughout Germany, a country that has long played a leading role in developing scientific techniques for the modernisation of herbal remedies. Over the past three years, I have spoken at length with the scientists and clinicians in these different sites about the challenges they face when working with herbal medicines. While in the laboratories I was given the opportunity to see the scientists at work as well as given layman's introductions to the technologies and equipment they use. In the clinics, I learned about the diagnostic criteria, clinical outcome measures, and patient selection processes used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of St. John's Wort and Heantos in the treatment of depression and addiction respectively. I also spent hours in medical libraries photocopying articles about the pharmacology of the plants I was interested in, as well as clinical trial results. I have done all this because I am interested in herbal medicine as a problem, or rather as a field of problematisation made up of bodies of knowledge and assemblages of practices. If herbal medicine is to be promoted, what are the problems to which it is seen as a solution? Conversely, if herbal medicine is to be discouraged, what are the problems that its practice and use are seen to engender? If we are in need of an alternative medicine then what are the failings of the medicine that it is an alternative to? If we are not in need of an alternative medicine then what should be done with those medicines which indeed are alternative? These are the kinds of questions which might be asked if we want to understand the conditions that make the alternative possible. Acknowledgments As always, the making of such a study as this could not have been possible without the support, guidance and expertise of a number of people. My sincere thanks to the Danish Research Agency for a three-year internationalisation grant which has not only allowed me 11 to devote my time entirely to this project, but also to do fieldwork in Vietnam and to attend international conferences; a privilege in today's world that is not lost on me. The grant has been ably administered by the Graduate School of International Development Studies at Roskilde University, my thanks to Professor Christian Lund and Inge Jensen for their support. Thanks also to the Central Research Fund of the University of London for a grant that has enabled me to carry out a number of field visits to laboratories and clinics in Germany. That I at all was given the chance to travel to Vietnam and to meet the many remarkable people that I have over the past years, I owe to Eva Arnvig and Dr. Lutz Baehr who I warmly thank for their support and encouragement over the years. In Hanoi, it is safe to say that without the generosity and assistance of Tran Khuong Dan, Professor Tran Van Sung, Nguyen Ba Chinh and Nguyen Quang, this study would never have happened. The passion and inventiveness of their work remains an inspiration in my own. Thanks also to the Institute of Chemistry of the National Academy of Natural Science and Technology for generously providing me with facilities and assistance, especially with translation, during my stays. I also owe my gratitude to Professor Hoang Bao Chau for patiently providing me with fascinating first-hand insight into the history of traditional medicine in Vietnam. And in further socio-historically contextualising my own contemporary analysis I have benefited greatly from the work of Laurence Monnais, Michele Thompson and Annick Guenel, all of whom generously shared their knowledge and insights with me. In Europe, my thanks go to herbalists Nina Nissen and Ned Reiter for taking the time to talk to me about the many challenges facing their profession in the UK. Thanks also to Professor Walter Muller of the Department of Pharmacology, University of Frankfurt for inviting me to his laboratories and educating me on the pharmacology of St. John's Wort. At the Leibniz Institute of Plant Bio-Chemistry in Halle, Professor Ludger Wessjohann and Dr. Katrin Franke were very patient and thorough in answering my many questions about their work on the phytochemistry of Heantos. My analysis has benefited considerably from what I learned. On the clinical side, I would like to express my appreciation to Professor Norbert Scherbaum of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Duisburg-Essen. Thanks also to Dr. Klaus Linde of the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the Technical University of Munich for his insight into the complexities surrounding the clinical testing of complementary therapies. And on the 12 regulatory side, my thanks to Anna Dixon (LSE Social Policy) for sharing her extensive insight into the development of professional regulation for CAM practitioners, both nationally and internationally. In terms of academic training and inspiration, there are also a number of people whom I am greatly indebted to. As already alluded to, this project and the questions that it attempts to raise started some years ago for me. The community of students studying international development studies at Roskilde University in the late 1990s, especially the grid'ers among us, were a massive motivation for me in deciding to continue with my academic training. Fellow PhD candidate and philosopher Janne Mantykoski has also been an invaluable intellectual companion for almost two decades now. Since moving to London to study at the LSE, I have been especially fortunate to be able to share the challenges and highlights of postgraduate research with fellow PhD students at the BIOS Centre and at LSE Sociology. In particular, I would like to thank Chris Hamilton, Annette Jensen, David Reubi, Dr. Scott Vrecko, Linsey McGoey, Megan Clinch, Kerstin Klein, John MacArtney, Btihaj Ajana, Lamprini Kaftantzi and Mathew Kabatoff for always constructive engagement and for so many delicious cakes. I would also like to thank Dr. Carlos Novas, Dr. Filippa Lentzos and Dr. Michael Barr for sharing their insight and thoughts along the way, especially Carlos and Filippa for comments and valuable help in the final working through of the dissertation. As a part of my Danish internationalisation grant I have had the fantastic fortune of receiving support from two places, my grant-administering institution in Denmark, Roskilde University and the London School of Economics where I have been enrolled. A warm thanks to my supervisor of many years in Denmark, Dr. Afonso Moreira for guidance, countless brainstorming sessions, and for always challenging me when I thought I had reached my limits. In London, a very special thanks to my supervisor Professor Nikolas Rose for welcoming me to the LSE and helping me to develop academically in such an amazing environment as BIOS. This dissertation could not have come into being without his intellectual guidance and support. It has been a privilege. 13 Family and friends who are by now spread across the world's continents, though happily only cyber-seconds away, have and continue to be a constant source of inspiration and encouragement. And finally, yet in so many, many ways above all, thank you to Helle and Mathias. 14 1 Modern failures, traditional remedies When a working party put together by the British Medical Association in 1983 reported on some of the main causes they had identified to explain a growing interest in alternative therapies, their conclusions were rather familiar: Relatively few years ago, when little therapeutic help could be offered, the physician devoted much time to counsel and to support the patient. Now therapeutic intervention, often life-saving, is quickly and skilfully available, and has become so commonplace that the swiftness of the changes is forgotten and the significance of the consequences passes unnoticed. One of the consequences of the changed nature of the relation of the doctor to the patient is that the current pressures and the technical demands of modern medicine do not allow him the opportunities formerly devoted to counselling, sympathetic contact and support... An additional consequence of the advances in medicine in the latter part of this century is the impact of these far-reaching changes on the nature of the doctor's training, with increasing emphasis on the scientific aspects of the curriculum, and a growth of specialisation... An additional aspect should be mentioned. The growth and dependence on new diagnostic aids of all kinds, the nature of the haematological and pathological services, and their matter-of-fact and impersonal nature are identified by the patient, the physician and the medical technologist alike as an intrusion juxtaposed between patient and physician... Yet this new orientation and attitude of doctors trained in the last 30 years has not been matched in the provision of support services to meet the novel and still-growing demand from the modern patient for communication, information and instruction. (British Medical Association. Board of Science and Education. 1986: 3-4) It is no secret that modernity has of late been in for somewhat of a scolding. The processes of industrialisation, commodification, technologisation, differentiation, rationalisation, modernisation, professionalisation, and bureaucratisation that are considered defining of the modern era have been variously diagnosed as alienating, disenchanting, ossifying, repressing, and dehumanising in their effects."
