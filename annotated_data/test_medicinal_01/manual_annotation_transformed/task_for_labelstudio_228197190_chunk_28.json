      "text": "It is a relatively new technique for plant authentication which requires more research, in comparison to the other identification methods which have a long standing and reputable use. The results from this investigation have revealed the usefulness of DNA analysis and can be used to contribute to this evolving discipline. 4.7.3 The Applications of DNA Barcoding for Medicinal Plant Identification While conducting background research into Ocimum DNA sequences it became apparent that there was a lack of reliable reference Ocimum DNA sequences available in the databases such as GenBank and BOLD. Chase et al. (2005) highlighted this as a potential limitation of DNA authentication, as there is a lack of DNA barcodes available in the reference databases. Before authentication of tulsi samples could commence a reference database needed to be created to be able to verify the species. This research has had an important role in collecting 196 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra a range of authenticated Ocimum specimens (n=33) from around the world to create reference barcodes which will make future authentication faster and reliable; in addition, these sequences will be submitted to the GenBank and BOLD databases. As recommended by The Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) Plant Working Group, initially the plastid matK and rbcL regions were explored for amplification of DNA samples (Kress et al., 2005; Chase et al., 2005). The PCR results were highly variable and the sequence data for the few samples which did provide a positive PCR result were very poor. From the literature it was clear these regions are highly valuable; however, their use with the Ocimum species was limited and required optimisation. When other regions such as the nuclear ITS and plastid trnH-psbA were explored amplification and sequencing results were much better. The ITS region had limited success as it was only able to amplify and sequence some of the Ocimum species (O. tenuiflorum, O. selloi, and O. gratissimum), while the trnH-psbA region provided better DNA sequencing data for a larger range of species. Of the total 111 tulsi and Ocimum samples collected during the research period, 82 samples were used for the final analysis of which 67 samples (82%) were successfully identified with the combination of the ITS and trnH-psbA regions. In order for DNA barcoding to work there must be enough variation in the DNA sequence to differentiate species from one another (interspecific variation); and a much lower level of variation within a species (intraspecific variation) (Lahaye et al., 2008). The intraspecific variation is known to be relatively low for both ITS and trnH-psbA (Kress et al., 2005). The results from this investigation revealed that the ITS region had higher intraspecific variation than the trnH-psbA region, as it was able to identify more base differences in the DNA sequence. The ITS region was highly variable but limited due to poor quality sequence data. The trnH-psbA region provides a high level of interspecific variation, therefore allowing the discrimination of different species (Kress et al., 2005). The results from this study revealed that both the ITS and trnH-psbA regions were able to distinguish and identify several Ocimum species; nevertheless, more samples (n=66) were identified using the trnH-psbA region than the ITS region (n=35). Several challenges of using the ITS region were encountered during the investigation, including the difficulty amplifying and sequencing samples, the amplification of fungal DNA instead of the plants, and poor quality sequence data possibly due to paralogous copies of ITS region being present. In cases where the complete ITS region was difficult to amplify and sequence the ITS2 region was recommended and tried; but, no improvement in results were obtained. The trnH-psbA region worked more efficiently than the ITS region and provided higher quality sequence data. Although, there is a risk of low variability within 197 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra species, the differences found for the Ocimum species was sufficient to discriminate between them. This was also observed by Hollingsworth (2011) who claimed the trnH-psbA region had better discriminatory power, and gave more efficient recovery of sequence data compared to other primer regions such as matK and rbcL. It has been proposed that a combination of regions should be used for the authentication of species (Kress et al., 2005; Li et al., 2011); this was successfully completed in this study and the results validated each other. A multigene approach using different priming regions such as the nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid trnH-psbA regions have been proposed as combinations for DNA barcoding (Chase et al., 2005; Kress et al., 2005). This study has implemented these proposals and discovered some interesting results. Both regions have had varying degrees of success with the Ocimum species. The trnH-psbA region proved to be better than the ITS region at sequencing the Ocimum samples, as it was able to authenticate more than double the number of samples. Reference specimens (n=33) obtained from several sources (Professor Peter Nick - Botanical Institute Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany; Dr. Eike Reich - Director at CAMAG Laboratory, Switzerland; and The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew - DNA bank) were used to create reference DNA sequences to identify the species of samples collected throughout the project. A large proportion of the samples collected for analysis (n=67, 82%) were identified using the reference DNA barcodes created. Fresh and dried leaf samples were the easiest to extract DNA from, amplify and sequence. A total of 26 community samples were collected of which 81% (n=21) were identified as an Ocimum species. Commercial products which had been processed were often difficult to extract DNA from, as identified by the NanoDrop analysis which often showed little or no absorbance at 280nm. This may be due to manufacturing processes involved in formulating the products which may have damaged and degraded the DNA. Although one of the advantages of DNA analysis is that it is not affected by manufacturing processes, the results from this study found that steam treatment and drying in extreme temperatures did degrade the DNA of commercial samples collected (n=47); making it very difficult and sometimes impossible to extract DNA. But, because the trnH-psbA region is a shorter fragment it worked better with commercial samples (i.e. 13 commercial samples species were identified) where the DNA may have been degraded or sheared into smaller fragments, in comparison to a longer region such as the ITS (i.e. 5 commercial samples species were identified). A large number of the commercial samples (72%, n=34) could not be used in the analysis as DNA was not successfully extracted, similar problems were also encountered by Jurges et al. (2009) who also struggled to authenticate the species of commercial tulsi products. 198 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 4.7.4 The Key Discoveries of the Tulsi Project The cultural and commercial values associated with the tulsi plant can increase the risk of adulteration due to the constant and rising demand of the market (Christina and Annamalai, 2014). The correct identification of tulsi plants is made difficult by the similar morphological features of the Ocimum species. Raam and Shyam tulsi samples collected in India looked very similar; whereas, samples from the UK were distinctly different. Both Raam and Shyam tulsi are supposed to be varieties of O. tenuiflorum; however, the DNA analysis identified Raam tulsi samples collected from SA communities in the UK and Africa as O. gratissimum instead. According to the results from this investigation, Raam tulsi species have been substituted in the UK; but how relevant this is to SA communities remains to be investigated. Many of the commercial samples collected did not specify the type of tulsi (i.e. Raam or Shyam), except for samples from Pukka Herbs(r); the Raam and Shyam tulsi samples from Pukka Herbs(r) did match the O. tenuiflorum references. In addition, Raam and Shyam samples collected personally during field work in India were also correctly identified as O. tenuiflorum; further supporting the theory of species substitution in the UK. Plant species which are difficult to source, expensive, and have limited availability are subject to adulteration with products which maybe morphologically similar. Using taxonomically correct plants is critical to the safety and efficacy of herbal medicine (WHO, 2002b). Adulteration of plants can have fatal consequences; therefore, the importance of selecting the correct plant species is of paramount importance, especially when consumed for medicinal purposes (Christina and Annamalai, 2014). The main reasons for keeping tulsi plants identified by participants in the UK were for cultural or religious purposes, in which case the species of the plant may not be as important. Different species may have different pharmacological effects; therefore, the species used for commercial and medicinal purposes must be properly identified and authenticated. DNA analysis has proved to be a technique which can accurately identify and discriminate between the Ocimum species. The results of this investigation have enabled new reliable reference DNA sequences for the Ocimum species to be created and will contribute to the DNA databases currently lacking this information (Appendix 13 & 15). This will enable more efficient authentication of Ocimum samples to take place. The ITS and trnH-psbA regions have been able to successfully authenticate and discriminate several Ocimum species. A range of unknown Ocimum samples have been identified, illustrating the usefulness of this technique. 199 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 5.0 Chapter 5 - Discussion 5.1 Overview of the Research Outcomes The research set out to explore the knowledge and use of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian (SA) diasporic communities and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the UK. The results of this investigation have provided an insight in to the current use of herbal medicines (HMs) by South Asians (SAs), where ingredients for HMs are sourced from, how minor ailments are treated, and where the knowledge of HMs originates from and is transmitted through generations (Chapter 2). Furthermore, patients' perspectives of HMs (i.e. SA participants taking conventional Western medicines) were compared with the views of HCPs in the UK (Chapter 3). SA participants and HCPs views of HMs and some of the key finding from this research have been summarised in Figure 5-1. Figure 5-1 highlights how the results of these two phases of the research identified the problem of species substitution and the need for authentication of HMs; as well as identifying a medicinal plant of interest (Tulsi, Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) for DNA analysis. Tulsi was one of the most popular medicinal plants mentioned by participants in both strands of the research; the religious significance and numerous medicinal benefits associated with the plant make it a culturally and commercially valuable plant. Figure 5-1 Venn Diagram of South Asian Participants and Healthcare Professionals views of Herbal Medicines and the Connection of the Three Phases of the Study The Venn diagram summarises some of the key themes identified and illustrates how the three phases of the research (i.e. SATMED Project, HCPs survey, and the Tulsi Project) interlink and led on to the identification of a medicinal plant of interest (i.e. Tulsi) for DNA analysis. Key: CWM - Conventional Western Medicines HMs - Herbal Medicines SA - South Asian SAs - South Asians 200 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The use of DNA barcoding in ethnobotany is relatively new (Newmaster and Ragupathy, 2010). This research represents the first time where the use of DNA barcoding in ethnobotany has been used to explore medicinal plants used by a diverse migrant community living in Western urban cities. A mixed methods approach combining social science research methods (i.e. questionnaires and interviews) and DNA barcoding techniques were used to fulfil the aims and objectives of this study. 5.1.1 Objective 1: Explore the knowledge and use of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian diasporic communities, in the UK; describe where the knowledge originates from. While conducting the background research for this investigation, it became apparent that there was very little information on the use of traditional HMs by SA communities in the UK. Recent ethnopharmacological research has either looked at the general UK populations' perspectives of HMs (Ipsos MORI, 2008; Mintel, 2009), or focused on a specific gender, religious or ethnic group (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Jennings, 2014). Hence, evidence of the current use of HMs amongst the wider SA population in the UK has been limited. Bhopal (1986a) conducted his research on the use of HMs by Asian communities over thirty years ago; the results of this study provide an important update on the use of HMs by SAs in the UK. The South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) questionnaire was designed and administered by the primary researcher (Chapter 2), which enabled the collection of some valuable quantitative and qualitative primary data for this study. The migration of SAs introduced different religions, traditions, cultures, cuisines, and traditional herbal remedies to the UK (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005); yet little was known about the current use of HMs by SAs in the UK, until this research was conducted. Figure 5-2 illustrates the migration of SA participants to the UK, which may have been direct from South Asia (i.e. India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh) or via other parts of the world (e.g. Africa, Europe, The Middle East, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, etc. ); it also summarises what participants brought to the UK with them (e.g. their knowledge and traditions of HMs) and the challenges participants faced in the UK (e.g. lack of knowledge of Western medicines, difficulty sourcing ingredients for HMs, and cultural/ language barriers). 201 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The knowledge of HMs has been passed on orally from generation to generation (Chhetri, 1994; Hatfield, 2007) and there is a risk of losing this knowledge if it is not documented (Thring and Weitz, 2006; Bhattia et al., 2014); this research has enabled some of this valuable information to be documented, as the vast range of ingredients, remedies, and products participants used for traditional HMs has been summarised (Appendix 5). Participants from the SATMED questionnaires (80%, n=101) and Tulsi Project interviews (62%, n=8) revealed that family was the primary source for transmitting the knowledge of traditional HMs; although, religion, the internet, television, and social media were emerging as alternative ways of learning about HMs. Hegg (2013) also identified the way people are learning about traditional HMs is changing, due to advances in technology and the popularity of social media. The SATMED questionnaire revealed that there was a significant difference in knowledge of HMs between the genders (i.e. females knew more about HMs than male participants). Ernst (2000) claims that women generally use HMs more than men which may explain this difference in knowledge. Furthermore, gender differences in knowledge of HMs were also found by the Ipsos MORI (2008) and Mintel (2009) reports who claimed females had more knowledge of HMs than males. Figure 5-2 The Migration of South Asians to the UK - What Migrants Took with Them and Challenges They faced in The UK Direct migration of South Asians to the UK Migration of South Asians around the world Migration of South Asians from around the world to the UK The diagram represents the migration pattern of South Asians to the UK which may have been direct from South Asia or from other parts of the world where South Asians moved to. It also summarises what migrants took from their native country and the challenges they faced in the UK. 202 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra A significant difference in knowledge of HMs was also identified amongst participants from the different age groups in this study (i.e. older participants had more knowledge than younger participants). Although younger participants may not have had as much knowledge of HMs in comparison to older participants, this may be due to a lack of experience which comes with age. Bhopal (1986a) predicted that the use of traditional medicines by young SAs would decline in the future as people became more familiar with Western medicines. The results of the SATMED survey identified that traditional HMs still play an important role in the lives of SAs of all ages in the UK. The results revealed that SAs participants of all ages use HMs to supplement and maintain their health, treat minor ailments, and manage side-effects caused by conventional Western medicines (CWM). It can be concluded from this research that traditional HMs still play an important role amongst SA communities in the UK as they are regarded as safe and effective and part of peoples' traditional heritage. The Retail Think Tank (2013) identified that Western supermarkets, health stores, and online retailers are now stocking ethnic ingredients to cater for migrant communities. This was echoed by participants in this investigation who said ingredients for HMs which in the past were personally brought from abroad were now becoming commercially accessible in the UK. Participants identified some HMs, ingredients, dried plant material, and seeds (e.g. tulsi) which were still personally imported to the UK from abroad, mainly from India, Pakistan, and parts of Africa (e.g. Kenya and Uganda). This added to the interest of authentication of plant species in HMs which was explored further in Chapter 4 (Objective 3). As tulsi was one of the most popular products participants claimed to grow, import, and use for religious and medicinal purposes it was selected as the plant to be used for molecular analysis. The use of HMs alongside CWM was also explored in the SATMED questionnaire, where SA participants (who can also be considered as patients) were asked about whether or not they shared the information about their use of HMs with their HCPs; 69% (n=73) of participants did not tell their doctor, while even more (82%, n=87) did not tell their pharmacist. Various reasons for not sharing information about the use of HMs with HCPs were noted including: the fear of being labelled as backwards or old fashioned, treated differently or not treated at all, HCPs not understanding problems patients presented with (i.e. due to language and cultural barriers), and not seeing their HCPs to be able to tell them. Similar results were disclosed by Eisenberg et al. (2001) where participants also reported feeling that HCPs did not understand them."
