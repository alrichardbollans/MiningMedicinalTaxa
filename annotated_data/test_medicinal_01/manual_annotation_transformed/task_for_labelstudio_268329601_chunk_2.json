Their number, whichvaries from 1 to 1000+, appearance, and behaviorprovide important information in determining theclassification and evolutionary history of plants. Whenyou see a chromosome number cited in a text, thatcount is based upon an examination of nuclei takeneither from vegetative cells or from reproductive cells.In most higher plants, the nucleus in each cell of root,stem, or leaf tissue typically contains two completesets of chromosomes. The total number of pairedchromosomes in each of these vegetative cells isvariously referred to as its somatic or sporophyticchromosome number. On the other hand, thespecialized sex cells, the egg and sperm nuclei,typically contain only one complete set ofchromosomes. When we make reference to theirnumber of chromosomes, we are talking about thegametic chromosome number of a plant. If thenumber appears in terms of 2n, as in \"2n = 14,\" it isa somatic chromosome number. If it appears in termsof n, as in \"n = 4,\" it is a gametic chromosomenumber.One complete set of chromosomes is called agenome. It is often referred to by a letter, as in the\"B\" genome of wheat or the \"A\" genome of thebanana. A nucleus with a single genome is said to behaploid; a nucleus with two genomes is said to bediploid. Another situation, fairly common in plants,but rare in animals, is that of having more than twocomplete sets of chromosomes present in a nucleus.This condition is called polyploidy and plants in whichit occurs are called polyploids. Many of our mostimportant economic plants are polyploids. It may bea triploid with three sets of chromosomes, atetraploid with four sets, a pentaploid with fivesets, a hexaploid with six sets, etc. Plants with aneven number of chromosome sets are more commonthan those with an odd number. Whereas \"n\" and \"2n\"are used to tell the gametic and sporophyticchromosome numbers, respectively, x is used to tellthe number of chromosome sets (genomes) present ina plant. For example, if a plant is a triploid, it is 3x.When you read that the common breadwheat is 6x =42, the author is telling you that the nuclei contain six-7-genomes or sets, totaling 42 chromosomes. Eachbasic set (genome) is composed of sevenchromosomes (x = 7).Here are the somatic chromosome numbers (2n) fora series of economic plants:Banana: 3x = 33Coffee: 2x = 22; 4x = 44Coca: 4x = 24Cotton: 2x = 26; 4x = 52Marijuana: 2x = 20Wheat: 2x = 14; 4x = 28; 6x = 42Rice: 2x = 24A FEW GEOGRAPHICAL TERMSThe following terms are frequently encountered in theliterature of economic botany:Old World: the continents of Europe, Asia, and AfricaNew World: the continents of North, Central, andSouth AmericaOceania: the islands of the central and south Pacific.i. e. Polynesia, Micronesia, Melanesia, Australia, andNew Zealandtropics: the regions lying between the Tropic ofCancer and the Tropic of Capricorn (from 23.5E northlatitude to 23.5E south latitude)subtropics: bordering on the tropics; nearly tropicaltemperate: the region of the earth's surface lyingbetween each of the tropics and the nearest poleA FEW TERMS RELATING TO TIMEAD: Anno Domini, Latin for \"in the year of Our Lord,\"not \"After Death,\" as commonly believedBC: Before ChristBCE: Before the Christian, Current, or Common EraBP: Before Present (with present defined as 1950)Bronze Age: a cultural period in Old World humanpre-history characterized by the use of bronze intools, weapons, and ornaments.

The \"English system\" is just asaccurate as the metric system, but it is more difficultto understand and to use. A pint of a dry material isnot the same volume as one pint of a liquid. Weexpress weight using three different systems -- troy,apothecaries, or avoirdupois -- depending on what weare weighing. etc.Here are a few useful equivalencies:1 millimeter = 0.04 inches1 centimeter = 0.39 inches1 meter = 1.09 yards1 hectare = 2.47 acres1 gram = 0.035 ounces1 kilogram = 2.20 pounds1 metric ton = 1.10 short ton1 liter = 1.06 quartsThree quick and dirty approximations:1 gram = weight of 1 regular paperclip1 milligram = weight of 1 grain of salt1 mm = thickness of 1 dimeAnd, your thought for the day is, \"If God had wantedus to use the metric system, He would have given usten fingers!\"1.3 ! THE NAMES OFPLANTS\"Order is heaven's first law.\" (Alexander Pope)\"Yesterday I cut an orchid, for my buttonhole.... In athoughtless moment I asked one of the gardenerswhat it was called. He told me it was a fine specimenof Robinsoniana, or something dreadful of that kind.It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of givinglovely names to things. Names are everything.\" (Oscar Wilde, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\")\"There should be some things we don't name, just sowe can sit around all day and wonder what they are. \"(George Carlin)' ' ' ' 'Plants often have two names -- a common name usedby most of us in everyday circumstances when weneed to make reference to a plant growing in the yardor something that we might wish to purchase at themarket. They also have scientific names or Latinnames, as they are sometimes called, used bybotanists, agronomists, and by the \"serious\" amateur,etc. In this course, I will be using both commonnames and scientific names. You will not berequired to learn the scientific names of anyplants and you may use acceptable commonnames on the examinations. Many of you will,however, begin using the scientific names more andmore as the term goes along.-8-COMMON NAMESADVANTAGES. It would be foolish for me to maintainthat common names have no value. They are the onlynames known to most of us. These names are oftensimple, easy to remember, descriptive, colorful,pleasing to the ear, and easy to pronounce. Given thisimpressive list of advantages, why do we not simplyuse common names for plants and be done with it?DISADVANTAGES. There are several reasons whybotanists and other scientists do not use commonnames:' A plant may have more than one common name.The broad-leaved plantain, a common lawn weed,has almost fifty other common names in Englishalone. In California and Oregon, one of ourcommon trees is called bay, bay leaf, Californiabay, myrtle, myrtlewood, pepperwood, andOregon myrtle.' The same common name may be used for morethan one plant. Laurel is a common name appliedto trees in five different plant families. We allknow what corn is. You may be surprised to learnthat in other English-speaking countries, theircorn is what we call wheat.' Many common names are confusing. A pineappleis not a kind of pine, nor is it an apple. Kentuckybluegrass is not blue, nor is it native to Kentucky.Names such as \"welcome home husband, nomatter how drunk ye be,\" \"kiss me over thegarden gate,\" \"spotted arsemart,\" and \"rampingfumitory\" certainly make it difficult to maintainthat common names have brevity and clarity ofmeaning.' Because there are no universally accepted rulesfor giving common names to plants, we cannotsay that one is the correct common name. Thereare certainly instances in which this becomescritical. If you pay $1000 for an ornamental treeat a nursery or take a particular herbal remedy,you want to be very sure of what you are getting.' Common names do not provide an indication ofclose relationship among the plants that share thename. Sour-grass, arrow-grass, blue-eyed grass,grass (marijuana), and China-grass are not kindsof grasses, nor are they related to one another.' Probably the most serious difficulty is that mostplants do not have common names. We have usedonly a small portion of the half million or so kindsof plants to the extent that common names havebeen applied to them. This is a problem forauthors of field guides, for consultants who writeenvironmental impact statements, and for staffmembers in various state and federal agencieswho must prepare material for generalconsumption. Authors have attempted tocompensate for this lack of common names byinventing them, usually by translating thescientific name into English. The advantage of\"Milo Baker's cryptantha\" over Cryptanthamilobakeri is not immediately apparent to me.SCIENTIFIC NAMESADVANTAGES. Although scientific names may causeyou some discomfort, their advantages to the botanistare compelling.' There is a single, universally recognized name foreach plant. Because they are used by botanists allover the world, scientific names facilitate the freetransfer of ideas and information. Consider thedifficulties that would arise if the botanists in theUnited States, England, Germany, Russia, China,etc. each had their own independent set of namesfor the plants of their countries.' The same scientific name may not be used formore than one kind of plant. Once it has beenpublished, that name cannot be used again forany other plant.' Scientific names are given according to an\"International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. \"These regulations are reviewed at InternationalBotanical Congresses. ' Inherent in our system of scientific names is theconcept of evolutionary or genetic relationship.When we name the white potato, eggplant, andblack nightshade Solanum tuberosum, Solanummelongena, and Solanum nigrum, respectively,we are indicating that these three plants belong tothe same genus, Solanum, and that they arerelated to one another. Because there is a set ofbotanical features associated with the name, ithas predictive value. If you know a plant belongsto the genus Quercus, the true oaks, you canpredict all kinds of things about it. You can betgood money that it will be a tree or shrub withleaves of a certain shape, and that it will have thefamiliar acorn as its fruit type.DISADVANTAGES. There are some difficulties withscientific names.' They can be difficult to pronounce, especially ifyou did not learn to divide words into syllablesearly on in your education. You might note,however, that such familiar and easily pronouncedcommon names as aster, rhododendron,magnolia, chrysanthemum, petunia, and begoniaare also the first part of the scientific names ofthese plants. My own experience in teachingundergraduates to use scientific names is thatonce you can get past the psychological barrierthat these are terribly long words that only thosewho have had a strong background in Latin andGreek can pronounce, then you will become muchmore comfortable with them and begin using themrather easily.' One of the most frustrating features of scientificnames, especially for someone who is justlearning about them, is that they are changedfrom time to time. Just when you have learnedthe scientific names for a particular group ofplants, someone will publish a new revision of thegroup and you discover that some of the nameshave been changed. These changes come aboutfor several reasons. As new information about theanatomy, chemistry, and genetics of plantsbecomes known, it may cause botanists to rethinkthe evolutionary relationships among the plantsbeing studied. These changes may require us torevise the scientific names to reflect the new levelof information now available to us. Sometimesnames are changed, not for biological reasons, butbecause someone studying a group may discoverthat the name given to a particular plant has to berejected because it violated some provision of theInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature.-9-Both of these examples point out one of theimportant operating principles in plantclassification. As new information becomesavailable and as errors are discovered, we makeadjustments and corrections. What appears to bea fine scheme of classification today may bemodified drastically or even discarded completelyat some point in the future.THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTSThe branch of the biological sciences that deals withthe classification of organisms is taxonomy orsystematics. The purpose of this discipline is tocreate a system of classification that best reflects ourknowledge of the similarities and differences inorganisms. In the strictest sense, the classification ofplants involves placing them in a series of categoriesthat have been arranged to show relationships to oneanother. The names and sequence of these categoriesare set by the International Code of BotanicalNomenclature. When these groupings are so arrayed,they constitute the taxonomic hierarchy, the list ofcategories into which plants are classified. Theprincipal levels of the taxonomic hierarchy and theirstandard endings, when applicable, are:division (or phylum): -phytaclass: -opsidaorder: -alesfamily: -aceaegenus: no single endingspecific epithet: no single endingPLANT FAMILY NAMESI will usually refer to a plant family by its commonname and its technical one. While all of the families ofvascular plants have the standard \"-aceae\" ending,eight of them have equally correct alternative names.They constitute the only exceptions to the rule that atany level in the taxonomic hierarchy, each plant canhave only one correct name. They are permittedbecause these families are so well known to us byvirtue of their abundance and usefulness that theywere named long before our requirement ofstandardized endings was adopted. I use the oldernames; they were the first to be published. The eightfamilies with two equally correct names are: FAMILY EQUIVALENCIESFirst Published Family Name AlternativeCompositae (Sunflower family) AsteraceaeCruciferae (Mustard family) BrassicaceaeGramineae (Grass family) PoaceaeGuttiferae (Garcinia family) ClusiaceaeLabiatae (Mint family) LamiaceaeLeguminosae (Legume family) FabaceaePalmae (Palm family) ArecaceaeUmbelliferae (Carrot family) ApiaceaeLet me put your mind at ease. You will not be askedto learn the technical family names of any plants.COMPONENTS OF SCIENTIFIC NAMESIf we examine the botanical works of the 15th and16th centuries, we see that the name of a plant wasoften a lengthy series of descriptive words, typically inLatin, as in \"Convolvulus argentateus foliis ovatisdivisis basi truncatis: laciniis intermediis duplolongioribus.\" These phrase names or polynomialsbecame increasingly awkward because the discoveryof a new kind of plant required that the existingpolynomial be slightly modified so that it could bedistinguished from the older one.A new way of naming plants was developed over fourcenturies ago to replace the polynomials. It waspopularized in the 17th century by Carolus Linnaeus,the leading botanist of his time. This system wasbased upon the principle that each plant (or animal forthat matter, because they are named according to thesame scheme) is given a scientific name that consistsof two components, both of them parts of thetaxonomic hierarchy mentioned above. The firstelement of the scientific name is the genus (orgeneric name), as in Triticum, the genus of wheat.The plural of genus is genera, not genuses. Thesecond element is the specific epithet, as inaestivum, the particular kind of wheat called breadwheat. This second element of the scientific name isoften incorrectly called the \"species.\" It is the genusand specific epithet together that form the speciesname. Triticum aestivum is the species name of breadwheat. Because the name of a plant or animal is thecombination of these two words, the scientific name iscalled a binomial and we call this scheme of givingtechnical names to organisms the Binomial Systemof Nomenclature.The binomial, for reasons of completeness andaccuracy, is followed by the name (typicallyabbreviated) of the person or persons who firstpublished that name for the plant. For example, in thescientific name Zea mays L., the \"L.\" stands forLinnaeus.It is sometimes necessary to transfer the name of aplant from one genus to another, usually becausemore recent research has demonstrated that the plantwas incorrectly assigned to a particular genus. Forinstance, Linnaeus called the tomato Solanumesculentum. Several years later, Philip Millerdetermined that the tomato should be in the genusLycopersicon, to separate it from the nightshades ofthe genus Solanum. The scientific name of the tomatobecomes Lycopersicon esculentum (L.) Miller. Theperson whose name is in the parentheses firstpublished the specific epithet for the plant. The nameafter the parentheses is that of the person whotransferred it into the genus where it now resides.It is often useful to recognize variation within aspecies. The two most widely used are thesubspecies (abbreviated ssp.) and the variety(abbreviated var.)."
