(Proleterska), 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* nbitoljanu@gmail.comIntroductionAccording to World Health Organization, the suicide death rate per population of 100000 in the Republic of Macedonia is 5.42 suicides (WHO, 2014). The most com-mon suicide methods in our country are hanging, intoxica-tion with corrosive substances and gunshot wounds. Rarest way of suicide is intoxication with drugs especially with barbiturates. We have only two cases of intoxication with barbiturates in the last five years. Materials and methodsCase hystory: Female, twenty-five years was found dead lying on the bed in a hotel room, where she stayed. During the external examination of the body on the crime scene we found complete development of rigor mortis. On the bedside table, were found a box of Diazepam, gel tube of Lidocaine, a plastic bag with white powder contents and two suicide letters (one designated for the mother, and one for the police). The suicide letters for the police contained the whole process of the suicide, with mentioning of the drug types used. In the letter was described Pentobarbital used because causes coma and respiratory depression, Li-docaine used for decrease the unpleasant bitter taste and Metoclopramide used to prevent vomiting. Postmortem blood and urine samples were collected for toxicological investigation. Toxicological qualitative analysis of blood using gas chromatography mass spec-trometry (GC-MS) was performed. Determination of eth-anol was performed using headspace gas chromatography. Quantification of urine samples was performed with fluo-rescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA, AxSym system analyser- Abbott, USA). ResultsAutopsy findingsPostmortem lividity was developed, distributed on the dorsal portion of the body and disappeared on blunt pres-sure. Medico-legal autopsy revealed no external changes. No findings of natural disease were observed. During the internal examination, we observed non-specific signs of asphyxia. The brain was slightly oedematous. The lungs were congested and oedematous, with subserous petechi-al hemorrhages.Toxicology findings GC-MS toxicological analysis confirmed the presence of Pentobarbital, Diazepam, Lidocain-M-(desethyl) and Metoclopramide. No ethanol was detected in the samples. FPIA results from the urine samples indicated a level of pen-tobarbital (more than 2000 ng/ml) and 498 ng/ml of diaze-pam. According to urine cut-off levels for reporting posi-tive blood level or limit of quantitation (CLR,2016), both urine pentobarbital and diazepam are over the cut off. No other drugs were found in the blood and urine of the victim.PsychoautopsyThe suicide letter to her mother contained the reason of the suicide explaining the lack of reason and motivation for life and fatigue, mentioning unsuccessful treatment at S3 PP 150320Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 319 - 320 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsphysiatrist. In the letter to her mother she stated that she was tired from being depressed all the time and that she had had nothing to live for, because she had no intention to work, get married or have a child. She had one previ-ous suicide attempt with barbiturates and benzodiazepines. Discussion Suicide is an act or an instance of taking one's own life voluntarily and intentionally. Suicide is a behavior that dif-fers from one person to another and from one time to an-other and has different motivations and anticipated gains. There are differences in the suicide method used in dif-ferent countries. Three methods - hanging, pesticide poi-soning and firearm are dominated. Jumping from a height and other methods of poisoning (i.e. mainly poisoning by drugs) occasionally appears as important alternative meth-ods. The suicide method with poisoning is more popular in women than in men. In general, underlying suicide pat-terns tell us more about the availability and acceptability of suicide methods than about other disparities (Ajdacic-Gross et al., 2008). Factors that affect the risk of suicide include genetic vulnerability and psychiatric, psychologi-cal, familial, social, and cultural factors. The effects of me-dia are also important; the spread of information about sui-cide methods affects the choices that people make when at-tempting to kill themselves. In this case during forensics analyses and psychoautopsy of the suicide letters we con-cluded depressed mood, lack of interest in pleasure, fillings of worthlessness, guilt, suicide statements and attempts all point out to major depressive disorder. Detailed description of suicide, the information of drug effects used direct on preparation process and internet investigation, which sug-gest awareness of the consequences.The suicide letter mentioned alleged ingestion of Pen-tobarbital, Diazepam, Lidocaine and Reglan. The toxicol-ogy department of our institute confirmed the presence of these compounds in the blood and urine of the victim. Pen-tobarbital is a short-acting barbiturate that acts like a non-selective central nervous system depressant, and is primar-ily used as sedative hypnotic, as an anticonvulsant in sub hypnotic doses, medically induced coma and euthanasia in veterinary medicine (Charney et al., 2006; Greenblatt et al., 1979). In cases of intoxications, suppression of the cen-tral nervous system, hypotension, hypothermia, coordina-tion disorders, respiratory failure and coma are the major clinical symptoms (Fell et al., 1968). Diazepam is a de-rivative of benzodiazepine that is widely prescribed as an antianxiety agent. Diazepam is sometimes used with other medications to treat seizures. When barbiturates are com-bined with other central nervous system (CNS) depres-sants, such as alcohol, opiates, or benzodiazepines, over-dose is even more dangerous due to additive depressant effects on the CNS and respiratory system (Mactier et al., 2014). The clinical effects of barbiturates and benzo-diazepines are similar and result as sequelae to hyperpo-larizing the neuron, there are subtle differences in terms of receptor binding. Barbiturates increase the duration of Cl ion channel opening at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, which, in turn, increases the efficacy of GABA. Benzodiazepines, on the other hand, increase the frequency of Cl ion channel openings at the GABA recep-tor, which, in turn, increases the potency of GABA (Shar-ma and Hoffman, 2011). ConclusionSuicides with intoxication with these types of drugs are rare because of the unavailability of drugs, because they are prescription drugs, or are intended for clinical practice only. This case, suggest on detailed planned and determination to end her life. The combination of Pentobarbital, Diazepam, antiemetic drugs and the content of the suicide letter stat-ing when, and how she will die, suggest that the victim was familiar with drug effects and knew where to get them. We should point that among all classical forensic methods, we include psychoautopsy as a good method which helps us to finalize all investigation and make scientific based conclu-sions for motivation and way of taking her own life.

Cyril and Methodius University,Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* leonardkurti@hotmail.comIntroductionFor centuries, juniper berries and leaves extracts and their essential oils have been used in the folk medicine due to their therapeutic properties, such as antimicrobial, an-ti-inflammatory, diuretic, hypoglycemic, hypotensive and analgesic effect. Due to the exclusive aroma, juniper cones are utilized in the food industry as a spice and in the pro-duction of alcoholic beverages as flavor. Today, there is an increased interest in the identification of natural and safe sources of antioxidants, in order to replace synthetic anti-oxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylat-ed hydroxytoluene (BHT) and tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) which have a limited use due to their toxicity and carcinogenicity.The purpose of this study is to determine total phenols, total flavonoids and the antioxidant activity of ethanol ex-tracts from berries of Juniperus excelsa, Juniperus commu-nis and Juniperus foetidissima from different localities of the R. of Macedonia.Materials and methodsThe plant samples were collected in late autumn in 2011 and 2012. The berries (4 samples) of J. communis (JC) were collected from Skopje (sk), Velestovo (ve), Kice-vo (ki), and Resen (re), the berries (2 samples) of J. excel-sa (JE) from Dojran (do) and Velestovo (ve) and the berries (2 samples) of J. foetidissima from Valandovo (va) and Ve-lestovo (ve). Botanical identification was made at the Insti-tute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy - Skopje. The plant material was properly dried, stored in paper bags and kept in dark and cool place until testing.The plant material (0.5 g) was milled to a fine powder and extracted with 70% ethanol. The extraction procedure for sample preparation was performed with 10 mL of 70% ethanol for 30 min in the ultrasonic bath. After filtration of the extracts, the volume was adjusted to 10 mL. Estimation of the total phenolic content (TPC) was done using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent according to the Sin-gleton's method with minor modifications.The total flavonoid content (TFC) was estimated using the aluminium chloride colorimetric method described by Talari (Talari, 2012).The antioxidant activity was determined using three methods: DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) method, FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) method and H2O2 (Hydrogen peroxide) method.The ability of the tested extracts to reduce the DPPH radical was determined from the color bleaching of the purple ethanol solution of DPPH. The antioxidant activi-ty of the extracts is expressed as IC50 (mg/mL), indicating the concentration that is required to cause 50% reduction of the DPPH radical. The FRAP activity of the extracts was determined according to the procedure described by Oyai-zu. The scavenging capacity of the extracts for hydrogen peroxide was determined according to the method of Ruch with minor modifications. S3 PP 151322Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 321 - 322 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe content of total phenolic compounds in all in-vestigated samples vary from 41.32+-0.20 mg GAE/g dw to 96.83+-0.41mg GAE/g dw in the samples JF(va) and JE(ve), respectively. The total flavonoid content in the plant samples was in the range from 14.03+-1.20 mg QE/g dw to 34.01+-3.87 mg QE/g dw in the samples of JF(va) and JC(ki), respectively.All the extracts showed antioxidant activity using the DPPH method. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the samples increased with an increase in extract concen-tration. The ability of the corresponding extract for reduc-tion of DPPH free radicals expressed as IC50 values was obtained in the range from 0.006 mg/mL for the sample JF(ve) to 0.713 mg/mL for the sample JC(ki). The obtained reducing ability against DPPH radical was compared to the IC50 values for Quercetin and BHA (1.0 ug/mL and 6.0 ug/mL, respectively). All tested samples manifested good scavenging potential for H2O2. The lowest inhibitory activ-ity against H2O2 was found in JE(do):17.68%, 16.29% and 15.24% for the extract concentrations 25, 10, and 5 mg/mL, respectively, while the highest inhibitory activity was found in JF(va): 52.73%; 49.47% and 44.2%, for the corre-sponding extract concentrations.The ferric reducing antioxidant potential was deter-mined by evaluating the capacity of the extract to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Very similar to the DPPH test, the reducing antioxidant potential of every extract showed a positive correlation with their concentrations. The JF(ve) sample showed the strongest reduction of iron 51.08%, 25.19%, and 16.33% for the corresponding concentrations of the extract (0.71; 0.28 and 0.14 mg/mL), while the weak-est activity is detected in the JC(re) sample with 18.85%, 11.13% and 6.88% for the corresponding extract concen-trations. The activity of extract was compared to the reduc-ing capacity of two standard substances - ascorbic acid and quercetin in concentrations of 0.007 mg/mL, with 27.71% and 21.37% FRAP capacity, respectively.The berries of the Macedonian wild grown J. commu-nis, J. excelsa and J. foetidissima are a rich source of poly-phenolic compounds. These results are corresponding to those obtained by other authors (Miceli et al., 2009, Elmas-tas M., 2006). Additionally, the obtained values for the an-tioxidant potential of the tested samples are also in accor-dance with the results found in numerous research papers in the field of interest, suggesting that the selected plant samples are a rich source of phenolic and flavonoid com-ponents, and a potential source of antioxidant compounds (Stassi et al., 1998).ConclusionAccording to the obtained results for total phenols, fla-vonoids and the antioxidant potential of the selected plant samples, it may be concluded that the ethanol extracts of berries of J. communis, J. excelsa and J. foetidissima rep-resent potential sources of natural antioxidants. Although a positive correlation was obtained between the total phenol content and the antioxidant activity, further studies are re-quired to clarify which of the components are responsible for the antioxidant properties."
