A broth microdilution method was used todetermine minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of testedcompounds according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute(CLSI 2005). All tests were performed in Muller Hinton broth forbacterial strains and in Sabouraud dextrose broth for Candidaalbicans. Overnight broth cultures of each strain were prepared, andthe final concentration in each well was adjusted to 2 x 106 CFU/ml forbacteria and 2 x 107 CFU/ml for yeasts. The investigated acids weredissolved in 1% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted to thehighest concentration. A serial doubling dilution of the compoundswere prepared in a 96-well micotiter plate over the range of 31.25-1000g/ml. In the tests, triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) (AldrichChemical Company Inc. USA) was also added to the culture medium asa growth indicator. The final concentration of TTC after inoculationwas 0.05%. The microbial growth was determined after 24 h ofincubation at 37 degC, for bacteria, and at 25 degC after the 48 h for fungiThe MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of the acid at whichthe microorganism does not demonstrate visible growth. Alldeterminations were performed in duplicate and two positive growthcontrols were included.The investigated acids were obtained in phase-transfer catalyzed (PTC)reactions of ketones with bromoform and aqueous lithium hydroxidein alcoholic solvent with TEBA or 18-C-6 as catalyst. We used: Cyclo-hexene-1-1-carboxylic acid 1, 4-terc-Butyl-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylicacid 2, 3-Methyl-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid 3, 4-Phenyl-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid 4, 4-Ethyl-cyclohex-1-enecarboxylic acid 5, 2-Phe-nyl-but-2-enoic acid 6, 2-Phenyl-acrylic acid 7, Bromo-piperidine-1,4-dicarboxylic acid 8 and 4-Bromo-piperidine-1,4-dicarbocilic acid mo-noethyl estar 9.resultsThe investigated acids exhibited similar antimicrobial activity againstGram positive bacteria which were more sensitive (the MIC values werein the range from 125-500 ug/ml ) than Gram negative bacteria, Thebest activity exhibited acids 6,7,8 and 9 which were active againstGram positive bacteria and both strains of yeast Candida albicans. Wecan conclude that tested complexes exhibited significantantimicrobial activity and should be considered as potentailantimicrobial agents. The purpose of further studies will be toelucidate the possible mechanism/mechanisms of action.references[1] Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI): Performance Standards for An-timicrobial Susceptibility Testing: 15th Informational Supplement.

Zlatkov, Pl. PeikovDepartment of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy,2 Dunav Street, 1000 Sofia, BulgariaThe aim of the current study is to introduce a heterocyclic moleculeat C8 position of the relatively long side chain of the 1,3,7-trimethylx-anthine, which would lead to potentially higher lipophilic properties.This would improve their transition through the blood brain barrierand manifest some effects on CNS. In order to achieve this a fewderivatives of 8-substituted 1,3,7-trimethylxanthines were preparedand the synthesis thereof was investigated.Melting points were measured in degC and corrected (Buchi 535). TheFTIR spectra 400 - 4000 cm-1 were recorded on a Nicolet iS10 FT-IR341fifth congress of phArmAcy of mAcedoniA with internAtionAl pArticipAtionMacedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY / BIOMOLECULAR SCIENCESposter presentationsSpectrometer in KBr. 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded at am-bient temperature on a Bruker-250 WM (250 MHz) spectrometer.Chemical shifts were expressed as values in ppm against TMS as aninternal standard. Preparative thin-layer chromatography was per-formed on DCAlufolien Kieselgel 60 F254 (Merck) (0.20 mm) sheets withsolvents (vol. parts): chloroform-acetone-ethanol (3:3:4), detected atUV 254 nm. The given yields are those of analytically pure product. Noefforts were made to optimize the yields.The amination of 8-bromocaffeine with the corresponding aminoal-cohol was carried out at temperature of 130 S, in the absence of sol-vent, whereat the reaction time is established to be 15 - 25 min. Thismethod ensures high yields of the obtained 8-(hydroxyalkyl)-aminocaffeines. The isolated caffeine derivatives react with excess ofhydrobromic acid and after cooling the synthesized 8-(bromoalkyl)-aminocaffeines are separated as crystal mass. The reaction ends withclose to quantitative yields.Then synthesized 8-(2-(bromoethyl)-, respectively 8-(3-(bromopropyl)-amino-caffeine interact with sodium salts of 4-ureido-2,5-2,5-dioxoimidazole and 2,3-dihydro-3-oxobenzisosulphonazole to yieldfour new N-substituted 8-aminocaffeines.The corresponding yields are between 25% and 89%. The obtainedproducts are white crystals substances, insoluble in chlorophorm, ace-tone and ethylacetate and moderately soluble in water and alcohols.The new compounds were characterised by microanalyses, FTIR andNMR spectrometry and results were consistent with the assignedstructures.The investigations of studied compounds for acute toxicity and anti-hypoxic activity are forthcoming.Four new N-substituted 8-aminocaffeine derivatives with fragmentsof 4-ureido-2,5-2,5-dioxoimidazole (allantoine) and 2,3-dihydro-3-oxobenzisosulphonazole (saccharin) in the side chain were synthesized.The structures were characterised by microanalyses, FTIR and NMRspectrometry and results were consistent with the assigned structures.Using the spectral data it was clearly demonstrated that 2,5-dioxo-4-ureidoimidazolidine moiety was bound to the alkyl side chain atposition 1, and not at position 3. The investigations of studied com-pounds for acute toxicity and antihypoxic activity are forthcoming.QsAr study of bile AcidshAemolyticAl potentiAlMihalj PosaDepartment of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Novi Sad,Hajduk Veljkova 3, 21000 Novi Sad, Republic of SerbiaIn the mechanism of promotory action of bile acids on the transport ofcertain drugs through the cell membrane an important role plays theirinteraction with membrane phospholipids. It should be also noticedthat bile acids damage cell membranes by withdrawing phospholipidsfrom them [1]. The increased promotory effect on drug transmembranetransport means at the same time an increased membranolytic effectof bile acids Bearing the above in mind it was interesting to study theeffect of the structure of bile acid molecules on their haemolytic po-tential as a measure of their membranolytic activity [2-4]Measurements of haemolytic potential was determined from citraterabbit blood [2] for 30 bile acid (BA) molecules of belonging to three li-near congeneric groups, with three (Group I) and two (Group II) oxygenatoms from OH or oxo groups bound to the steroid skeleton, and glycoconjugated cholic acid and glyco conjugated cholic acid derivatives(Group III). The haemolytic potential (Lys100) values (bile acid conn-centration at which 100 % lysis of erythrocyte membrane occurs), arerelated to the structure of the steroid nucleus by constructing a novelmolecular descriptors with 2D and 3D characteristics of topologicaldescriptors. Namely, with conventional topological descriptors (first-order connectivity index, third-order connectivity index, Wiener-index,Balaban-index, molecular topological index, cluster count, etc.) BAmolecules from the same congeneric group have identical values, sothat these descriptors can not be used to form a new model for thegiven congeneric group [5].The linear regressions (models) obtained in this work for each conge-neric group relate the Lys100s to this new descriptor. Statistical pa-rameters of these models, as well as their predictivity, indicate thesignificance of the obtained equations, that is that the haemolyticpotential (Lys100) is influenced not only by the number of OH and oxogroups in the steroid nucleus, but also by their steric einvironment [6].The work was financially supported by the Secretariat of Science andTechnological Development, AP Vojvodina, Republic of Serbia, GrantNo.114-451-2113/2011.referencesM.
