Financial rewards for healthy lifestyles have been suggested as an even more extreme incentive.With foodstuffs, medicines, functional foods as we defi ned them, and functional foods as others defi ne them, the primary task of regulators is to promote health. Regulation will have an effect on the dietary and medical choices of consumers. Functional foods have to be judged by their merits. The ultimate aim of regulation on functional foods should be to make consumer diets better and the amount of patients smaller. European and Chinese regulators cannot work alone to achieve this. As members of the WTO, they cannot decide to promote their industries and protect their citizens simply by dismissing foreign products. Food law and medicine law issues are better solved globally and international cooperation is integral.When regulating functional foods, the restrictive approach of protecting consumers is not enough. The governments must look at functional foods as a positive development. New healthy products coming to market and a wide selection of choices benefi t consumers. Besides health effects, functional foods can be valuable in offering business possibilities also for smaller companies and creating jobs. The governments must thus aim at regulatory solutions -309-that promote innovation and do not stifl e competition. The appropriate level of intellectual property protection needs to be carefully considered. The legislators must set clear, enforceable requirements and predictable, transparent procedures. Many governments have promoted food development also by allocating public research funds into food development.The concepts of 'food security' and 'right to food' have changed over time1590. Food security means that food is available and that it is safe. Law can potentially play an important role in both1591. Today food security is not just understood as a right to suffi cient food, but as a right to safe, nutritious, and healthy food1592. Functional foods might further widen the concept of food security. A person might, for example, be considered to have a right to use cholesterol-lowering foods. Here the task of governments and other governance regimes would be to ensure consumer access to safe and effective products. The WHO Nutrition report of 2003 recommends the creation of \"health-supporting environments\". It is not a question of communities vs. governments or local initiatives vs. legislation. Both are needed. Consumers and food chain operators need to be involved.1593 Administrative regulations, standards, and self-regulation are new modes of governance that have profound implications on how law and democracy are perceived.A lot of energy is currently being used to settle whether a product is a food or a medicine. This is particularly with plant-based products such as berries and herbs. The governments must look at the use of foodstuffs and medicines from a new perspective. Foods and medicines may well be used for similar purposes. This means food law and medicine law should be considered as a whole. The division of foodstuffs and medicines would lose its signifi cance if food law and medicine law were to be merged with each other. According to Howe, it is time to break down the somewhat arbitrary regulatory barriers that discriminate between foods used for sustenance alone, functional foods, food supplements, traditional or herbal medicines, other over-the-counter products and prescription medicines. Manufacturers, health providers and consumers would be better served by establishing a unifi ed approach for evaluating the health potential - and limitations - of all these products1594.We could aim at developing a range of integrated diet and lifestyle options for achieving and maintaining optimal health. If treatment was necessary, we could use the most effi cacious combinations of active nutrients with medication. Obvious examples are the use of low-fat diets with cholesterol-lowering drugs and low salt foods with blood pressure medication. However, medicine companies are not currently encouraged by the regulatory environment to evaluate the potential benefi ts of nutrient/medicine combinations. Adoption of such a combination approach will require an unprecedented level of cooperation between the regulatory authorities and all stakeholders.1595In addition to international fora, more discussion on food and medicine law is needed on national, local, and consumer level. An average consumer would probably want food and medicine law to promote health but also to guarantee information and freedom of choice. Part of consumers might want the law to promote sustainable development. In a democracy, 1590 Mechlem 2004, 647-648. 1591 Snyder 2004, 496. 1592 Mechlem 2004, 648.1593 WHO Nutrition Report 2003, 144.1594 See Howe 2000, S111.1595 See Howe 2000, S111.-310-citizens can vote representatives to change the laws if they wish. However, food and medicine law is not often familiar to consumers, and the issues are not debated before elections. If questioned, European consumers and citizens might have differing opinions, for example, on the following European legal solutions that currently exist:generic copies of originator medicines can be sold after 10 years has passed since -authorisation of the originator medicine,herbal medicines can be sold without proof of effi cacy, even if they have a relatively -short history of use in Europe,even thousands of year history of use in third countries does not allow a herbal medicine -to be sold in Europe,homeopathic medicines can be sold without proof of effi cacy, -old foods are presumed safe, and new foods are presumed safe if they are similar to old -foods,third country old foods such as vegetables and berries are presumed unsafe and it is thus -diffi cult to bring them onto the EU market,innovative foods are presumed unsafe and it is thus diffi cult to bring them onto the EU -market.What is relevant regarding consumer law is what the consumers expect of the law. The culture of trust in a regulated market affects expectations on how cautiously one needs to act on the consumer market. European consumers appear to expect the state to safeguard their position in the marketplace. However, even the legal cultures in Northern and Southern parts of Europe differ in this respect.1596 American consumers tend to trust collective consumer activism rather than consumer law1597.Even though Chinese legal rules and institutions are increasingly similar to their Western counterparts, legal culture will change slowly1598. The Chinese tend to trust neither the law nor the companies. In China, the difference between legal system surface and legal reality is a wider cultural phenomenon. It is related to the notion of 'rule by man', the reliance to family and friends in the fi rst place, and the Confucian principle of confl ict avoidance. In the Chinese legal culture, the administrator long had all the (imperial) power. The 'rule by man' tradition runs counter to rule of law. The separation of powers is new to the Chinese and reliance to social connections, guanxi, is deeply rooted and also runs counter to the establishment of rule of law1599.1596 Consumers in Northern Europe expect to be protected at the level of institutions and programs, whereas consumers in Southern Europe rely on personal contact with the seller, Howells et al. 2006, 257.1597 Business ethics as science, as corporate culture, and as brand strategy developed in the U.S. because legislation was too slow and ineffective in reacting to clear ethical problems in corporate behaviour. Regulation is in the U.S. often used only when absolutely necessary, freedom being a core value. This relates to the history of the U.S. as a British colony and the federal government as a representative of this colonial power. See Tolonen 2007.1598 According to Jones, Chinese legal system may some day be what it now is on paper. He suspects this will not happen soon, if ever. He thinks the surface will be similar to Western legal systems, but the legal culture will continue to be infl uenced by history. Jones 2003, 40.1599 Kubayashi 2008, 6.-311-Legal culture, including consumer trust in regulation, is not a stable phenomenon but changes through time. The roles of governments and other governance regimes are constantly in fl ux. Consumers will have to learn the most basic assumptions on a given legal culture:what can be expected of regulators, -what can be expected of companies, and -what is under their own responsibility. -From a consumer viewpoint, there is not a substantial difference between who regulates the companies: whether it is governmental bodies or non-governmental bodies. From business viewpoint, there is a difference between law, co-regulation and self-regulation. As the scope of business law widens, the room for business ethics becomes narrower, and vice versa: if business ethics are highly developed, law is supposedly not needed.Confucius relied on moral rather than legal rules. Currently rule of law is gaining importance in China. Reverting to legal proceedings is new in China and something that Confucius wholeheartedly avoided. Legal institutions are needed because of the transition from planned economy to market economy. This transition is not complete, which makes it diffi cult for the Chinese and others to know the roles of state vs. markets in China1600. According to Qingjiang, there is no turning back China's progress into a market-oriented economy and rule-based society1601. At the same time, rule of law is being discussed in Europe, as legislation is increasingly replaced by co-regulation, standards, and self-regulation. A new understanding of law is emerging. When China accepts rule of law, rule of law as we know it may no longer be the same.1600 See Lichtenstein 2003, 288, about corruption and the unclear role of the state.1601 Qingjiang 2002, 62.Academic dissertations on Food Chemistry published at the University of TurkuREINO R.
