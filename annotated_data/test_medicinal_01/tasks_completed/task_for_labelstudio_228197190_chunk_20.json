In total 112 surveys were attempted with participants dropping out at various stages; although 93 surveys were completed, responses for incomplete surveys were also used in the analysis to avoid losing some valuable data. This research has provided a unique insight into HCPs personal and professional opinions of HMs. As there is limited research into UK based HCPs views of HMs the results from this study can be used to contribute to this discipline. The use of social media to conduct scientific research has only gained attention in the last few years (Sarker et al., 2015), and proved to be highly valuable while conducting this research. By using social media to distribute the link to this survey it enabled HCPs from across the UK to be contacted to participate in this research. A range of different HCPs comprised this research population, instead of being limited to a single group of HCPs which would have been the case if postal questionnaires were used. As the survey was published online via SurveyMonkey it was easy to create, modify, and track the progress of the questionnaire. Other benefits of conducting this research using social media included the fast and efficient distribution of the survey, lots of responses were collected in a short period of time, and it was cheaper than printing and posting the questionnaires. The disadvantages of using social media while conducting this research included the lack of control of who was sharing the link, who was completing the questionnaire, and participants dropping out partway through. If the surveys were conducted face to face the process could have been regulated better with fewer participants dropping out or missing questions (Moore, 2000). The main issue was the lack of control over who was completing the questionnaire. One completed survey raised concerns about whether or not the participant was a HCP from the UK. In the introductory statement before the questionnaire there was great emphasis on 'UK based HCPs'. When the link for the survey was posted on Twitter and Facebook it was also emphasised: \"If you are a UK based healthcare professional please take a few minutes to complete this survey.\" For this reason later a question was added at the end of the survey to determine whether or not participants did or had worked in the UK, to try and overcome the issue of HCPs from outside of the UK being included in the analysis. Finally, one of the most time consuming parts of this investigation was the ethical approval process, as the use of social media and online surveys is a relatively new way of conducting research there were no guidelines for ethical approval (Beninger et al., 2014). Uncertainty amongst internal (DMU) and external (NHS) ethics committees meant the ethical review process was lengthy and complicated. Despite some of the drawbacks encountered during this study, the results 135 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra suggest it has been a very useful way of conducting research. HCPs from across the UK, the researcher would not have ordinarily come into contact with were able to take part. Responses from a variety of different HCPs representing various professions, age groups, and ethnicities were able to contribute their knowledge and opinions. As the survey was available online it enabled participants the freedom to complete it at their own leisure and pass it on to other HCPs they knew. The HCPs that formed this survey population were from a range of professions including pharmacy, medicine, dentistry, optometry, research and academia. Participants from various ethnic groups completed the survey, making it possible to compare ethnic differences between knowledge and use of HMs. Just under half of the participants (45%, n=50) said the use of HMs was part of their traditional family and cultural background. There was a statistically significant association between the traditional use of HMs and ethnicity. SA ethnic groups were more likely to say HMs were part of their family and cultural background than any of the other ethnic groups; while White British/ Irish participants were more likely to claim that HMs were not part of their traditional heritage. Over a third of participants (38%, n=42) said they used HMs themselves, these participants documented a large assortment of HMs they knew of or used. The most common products recalled by participants included turmeric, ginger, mint, honey, lemon, and Echinacea. Participants (53%, n=54) mentioned a wide range of HMs they knew of, for the four conditions listed: arthritis, cough, diabetes, and indigestion. In comparison to the findings from the SATMED questionnaire a more diverse range of herbal products were known and documented by the HCPs in this survey; products native to Asia (e.g. ajwain and tulsi) and Western countries (e.g. camomile and Echinacea) were mentioned. The diversity of products mentioned by HCPs could be because the questionnaire was open to all ethnic groups, and not restricted to just SA participants like the SATMED questionnaire. The results from this analysis revealed that HCPs who completed this survey had variable knowledge of HMs; some participants had extensive insight into a broad range of HMs, while others had limited knowledge. A difference in knowledge of HMs between ethnic groups was also identified, as more SA HCPs recalled HMs in comparison to White British/Irish HCPs. This knowledge difference could be linked to the traditional heritage of HMs amongst SA cultures which SA participants referred to in both this survey and the SATMED questionnaire. From the comments of several participants it was evident they were keen to learn more about HMs if there was evidence to support the claims associated with the use of HMs. When HCPs in this study were asked if their patients told them about their use of HMs 65% (n=64) said they did. However, when participants from the SATMED questionnaire were asked whether or not they told their doctor or pharmacist about their use of HMs, 69% 136 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra (n=73) said they did not tell their doctor while 82% (n=87) did not tell their pharmacist. This is supported by the findings of several studies which have found patients do not always tell their HCPs about their use of HMs. Giveon et al. (2004) found that 44.7% of participants did not tell their doctor about their use of HMs, whilst 11% did but only rarely. Results from the Ipsos MORI report (2008) on public perceptions of HMs found that 56% of participants felt it was important to tell their doctor about their use of HMs; interestingly they found that Asian and Black minority ethnic groups were less likely to disclose information about their use of HMs to their doctors (Ipsos MORI, 2008). The qualitative results from the SATMED questionnaire revealed that SA participants did not want to tell their HCPs about their use of HMs as they were afraid of being treated differently or not treated at all. The high rates of under reporting the use of HMs by patients may be influenced by several factors, of which ethnicity may be one (Williamson et al., 2013; Ipsos MORI, 2008); this could explain why the results for not reporting the use of HMs to HCPs was so high in the SATMED survey. The HCPs in this survey revealed that their patients informed them about their use of HMs fairly frequently. The importance of accepting and understanding cultural differences is vital for HCPs to be able to build rapport with their patients; as Staines (2011) highlighted, that negative attitudes of HCPs towards alternative therapies could be detrimental to the relationship with their patients. Building trust will help patients feel at ease when disclosing information about their use of HMs to their HCPs; this is vital for providing appropriate care for patients, identifying adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and interactions with HMs. Numerous herbal ADRs were noted by 31% (n=30) of participants. Some ADRs identified were considered to be minor effects (e.g. local irritation caused by using tea tree oil); whereas, others were more fatal and sometimes life threatening (e.g. hypoglycaemia caused by karela, or deranged liver functions caused by Kava kava). As people using HMs often 'self-prescribe' the risks associated with ADRs may not be known; Barnes et al. (1998) found that those who experienced ADRs (minor or serious) from HMs were less likely to see their GP than if it was an ADR caused by CWM. Although efforts to improve herbal pharmacovigilance have been implemented (i.e. the yellow card scheme has been extended to include herbal ADRs), herbal ADRs are still underreported and go unmonitored (Barnes, 2003). This reinforces the importance of HCPs being competent in recognising and reporting incidents associated with HMs. The most common herb-drug interaction reported by 33 participants in this research involved SJW. SJW was the third best-selling herbal remedy in the UK in 2013 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2014). Its traditional use for mild depression and anxiety has become so popular its status as a traditional herbal remedy has been questioned. It is one of the few HMs for which there is extensive research and clinical evidence to support the traditional health claims 137 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra associated. It could be due to the wealth of literature available for SJW that makes it so well known to HCPs. The most common CWM which participants identified as being affected by HMs was warfarin. Many participants described HMs which could potentially affect the efficacy of warfarin including garlic, gingko, SJW, and cranberry juice. Polypharmacy with CWM is common practice in patients with multiple health conditions; combining HMs into the mixture could increase the risk of ADRs and interactions (Edwards et al., 2012). Due to the unknown risk of herb-drug interactions some HCPs believe it is best to avoid taking HMs alongside CWM (Fugh-Berman and Ernst, 2001). Almost two thirds of participants (63%, n=62) in this survey were aware of herb-drug interactions and documented some of their knowledge. The 37% (n=36) of participants who said they were not aware of interactions between HMs and CWM highlighted the importance of educating HCPs about the potential risks associated with consuming HMs alongside CWM. Despite the range of ADRs and herb-drug interactions documented by the research participants their views on the safety and efficacy of HMs were mixed; 66% (n=63) of participants thought HMs were effective for treating and preventing various health conditions, and 58%, (n=56) said they were safe. Some participants felt the long standing use of HMs throughout history was sufficient evidence to support the use of HMs, while others made reference to the lack of evidence based medicine and scientific validation of HMs. The 42% (n=40) of participants who said they did not think HMs were safe and the 34% (n=33) who did not think they were effective felt the lack of clinical evidence for HMs meant they could not make an informed decision to determine the safety and efficacy of HMs. In addition, without randomised clinical trials to prove the efficacy of HMs many HCPs felt reluctant to recommend HMs to patients. Nevertheless, it was observed that those HCPs who had personally tried or used HMs were more likely to recommend them to their patients. Vickers (2000) suggested that recent advances in research have provided some good evidence to support the use of some complementary therapies; in addition, more research is being conducted around the world to provide evidence to support the use of CAM. Funding to support research has also been increased, although it still lags behind other areas of research and is still fairly restricted (Vicker, 2000; Cant et al., 2012). The significant majority of participants (65%, n=62) claimed they were not given any information on HMs during their professional training; while, even more participants (74%, n=71) believed that not enough training was provided on HMs. These results have given an insight into what HCPs in the UK think about the current level of education on HMs provided to them. The analysis reveals that HCPs are not satisfied with the existing level of training they receive on HMs, and many felt incompetent giving advice about HMs to their patients. Although regulatory bodies such as the GMC and GPhC do set standards which 138 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra require schools to include some information about CAM there is no defined syllabus; and in some cases a single lecture was deemed sufficient to meet the standards set by regulatory bodies (Smith, 2011). Very little high quality research on CAM exists (House of Lords, 2000), this could be a key reason as to why it is not extensively taught in undergraduate courses. More money is being invested in exploring the risks and benefits of CAM, and high quality research is being conducted worldwide (Vicker, 2000); this will provide better resources to educated HCPs so they can make informed decisions about HMs. Several participants expressed their interest in learning about HMs, especially if there was scientific evidence to support their use. There are some very useful texts to help HCPs learn about HMs, such as Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions (Williamson et al., 2013) and Phytopharmacy - An Evidence Based Guide To Herbal Medicinal Products (Edwards et al., 2015); however they are not readily available to all HCPs. The British National Formulary (BNF) is a vital resource for HCPs and is available to all doctors and pharmacists and many other HCPs. The BNF July 2015 edition explains why information on HMs is not included in the BNF; it states, \"while it would be useful to have information about herbal medicines in the BNF, in order to provide reliable and authoritative information on homeopathic or herbal medicines, it would be necessary to set up a parallel structure with specific expertise in complementary medicine. It would be very difficult to achieve this and to include all the information in the BNF.\" Having access to texts which would help HCPs make informed decisions about the safety and efficacy of HMs will help improve HCPs knowledge of HMs, relationships with patients, and increase HCPs confidence in advising patients about the use of HMs (Pokladnikova and Lie, 2008). As the popularity of HMs continues to grow (Zhang et al., 2012), and HMs become more integrated into Western healthcare (Vickers, 2000), the importance of HCPs being aware of the risks and benefits of consuming HMs alone or in conjunction with CWM will become more important. In order to ensure patients are receiving the correct pharmacological care it is vital for HCPs to deduce their patients' use of HMs; a concept which needs to be reinforced to HCPs in the UK. Changes to the regulation of HMs and more clinical research are providing evidence based support for the safety and efficacy of HMs. Furthermore, better training and education on HMs for future HCPs means they will be equipped with the knowledge to identify potential ADRs and interactions, and advise patients on the safe use of HMs. There are very few studies which have explored UK based HCPs views on CAM (Smith, 2011), and little research actually focuses on just HMs. The results from this investigation have enabled an insight into HCPs personal use and professional views of HMs to be uncovered; providing valuable data for future research. 139 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 4.0 Chapter 4 - The Tulsi Project 4.1 Introduction The Tulsi Project was developed after considering the results from the main South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) questionnaire (Chapter 2); which explored the current use of traditional herbal medicines (THM) by South Asian (SA) diasporic communities, in the United Kingdom (UK). DNA authentication projects conducted by colleagues at De Montfort University (Chapter 2, section 2.6.2, p37) and other researchers have highlighted how DNA barcoding has been used to identify adulterant and substitute species in herbal medicines (Howard et al., 2009; Kumar, 2015; Seethapathy, 2015) have inspired this research. Tulsi (Holy basil, O. tenuiflorum L.) was identified as one of the most popular herbal ingredients used and known by the SATMED participants. This plant stood out from all of the other common herbal products identified such as ginger (Zingiber Officinale Roscoe) and turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) for several reasons. Firstly, the numerous health benefits associated with tulsi ranged from minor skin ailments to long term health problems like asthma and diabetes (Chapter 2, Section 2.6.2, p37). When participants were asked if they grew any plants for medicinal purposes, tulsi was one of the main plants, after mint, which was grown; tulsi seeds were commonly brought to the UK from Africa and India. In addition, when participants revealed what products they imported to the UK from abroad it was commonly dried tulsi leaves or seeds; with reference to the poor growth conditions and low survival rates of the plant in the UK. The religious significance of tulsi was also noted as participants referred to the value of the plant for Hindus. After considering all the information collected, it was evident that participants grew their own tulsi plants, imported material from abroad (Africa and India), and bought commercial products from suppliers in the UK, online, and abroad. A variety of different tulsi plants were recognised by participants, with frequent references made to Raam, Shyam (Krishna), and Vana tulsi. Raam and Shyam tulsi are varieties of O. tenuiflorum which is native to Asia; whilst some authors claim Vana tulsi is O. gratissimum L. (Joshi et al., 2012). As participants revealed that they grew plants from seeds they acquired from abroad, an interest in the species of tulsi plants grown in the UK developed; the applications of DNA analysis for species authentication to identify tulsi species were then explored. DNA barcoding is a relatively new technique that can be used to discriminate between different plant species, and identify any contaminants or adulterants."
