Their correctbotanical provenance is an essential basis for understanding the ethnic cultures, aswell as for chemical identification of the novel bioactive molecules with therapeuticeffects. This work describes the use of herbal medicines in the Beskid mountain rangeslocated south of Krakow and Lviv, two influential medieval centers of apothecary traditionin the region. Local botanical remedies shared by Boyko, Lemko, and Gorale ethnicgroups were a part of the medieval European system of medicine, used according totheir Dioscoridean and Galenic qualities. Within the context of ethnic plant medicineand botanical classification, this review identified strong preferences for local use ofSt John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.), garlic(Allium sativum L.), gentian (Gentiana lutea L.), lovage (Levisticum officinaleW.D.J. Koch),and lesser periwinkle (Vinca minor L.). While Ukrainian ethnic groups favored the use ofguilder-rose (Viburnum opulus L.) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), Polish inhabitantsespecially valued angelica (Angelica archangelica L.) and carline thistle (Carlina acaulisL.). The region also holds a strong potential for collection, cultivation, and manufactureof medicinal plants and plant-based natural specialty ingredients for the food, healthand cosmetic industries, in part due to high degree of biodiversity and ecologicalpreservation. Many of these products, including whole food nutritional supplements, willsoon complement conventional medicines in prevention and treatment of diseases, whileadding value to agriculture and local economies.Keywords: ethnobotany, traditional knowledge, herbal texts, bioactive compounds, functional foods, folkremediesINTRODUCTIONThe terms Beskids or Beskid Mountains (Beschad Alpes Poloniae) denote the Carpathian mountainranges that historically separated kingdoms of Poland from Ruthenia (Ukraine) and Hungary asdescribed in the 1269 Hungarian deed (Papee, 1891). The Beskids are approximately 600 km inlength stretching from Moravian Gate in the west (Czech Republic) to Vyshkovsky Pass in the216Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicineseast (Ukraine) along the modern Polish-Slovak border, but arerather narrow (50-70 km in width). Gorale, Lemko, Boyko, andRusyn ethnic groups of mixed Slavic, Vlah (Aromanian) andThraco-Celtic origins primarily populate these areas (Figure 1).During tenth-fourteenth centuries, Beskids formed a transborderregion of limited political and economic affiliation, defined bya line of defensive border settlements (La: ultra indagines, Ua:zasiky, Pl: bron) advancing slowly toward the mountain ridgesalong the Spis-Borzhava axis in the south and Myslenice-Sanok-Dolyna axis in the north (Halaga, 1961). Turka on the route toUzhok Pass and Wietrzno-Bobrka on the route to Dukla Passwere typical examples of such defensive hillforts (Ua: gorodysche,Pl: grodzisko). In the fourteenth century, continuous colonizationof the Beskids was described as of Ruthenus, Ruthenus-Valachus,Ruthenos seu Valachos, or Valachus origin (Hoshko, 1983).The ongoing debate whether these terms identified a properethnic affiliation of the migrants or their rustic (agricultural) vs.valachian (pastoral) background has not been settled (Stavrovsky,1967). The transborder status, however, combined with severegeographical and socioeconomic isolation, resulted in self-treatment as a primary choice of both medicinal and spiritualhealing. Even at the beginning of the twentieth century, onemedical doctor served on average 9,000-17,000 inhabitants(Otchet, 1915), and a doctor's reputation and recognition waswell below that of a local pharmacist or a traditional healer.The use of plants and their preparations in Europeanmedicine, drawing upon the traditions of both the classical andArab civilizations, was formalized by works of Hippocrates ofKos (Corpus Hippocraticum), Dioscorides (De Materia Medica),Pliny (Naturalis Historiae), Avicenna (Liber Canonis), andGalen of Pergamon (Hidden Drugs, survived only in Arabictranslation as Al-Adwiya al-Maktuma) as the science of usingfresh plants and dry herbs to improve human health (Cruse,1999). Prior to 900-1200 AD, however, no written recordsdescribed traditional herbal treatments used by Celtic, Slavic,and Germanic tribes that bordered the Roman Empire. Firstmedieval manuscripts that partially documented the use ofherbs in these areas were largely translations from earlierFIGURE 1 | Study area that includes Beskin ridges of the Carpathin Mountains: (A) Schematic map of the mountain region that serves as a border between Ukraine,Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania, and (B) Schematic mountain areas inhibited by Gorale, Lemko, Boyko, Rusyn, and Hutsul ethinc groups.Latin works that incorporated local variations in methods ofcollection, preparation, and use (Singer, 1927), including Bald'sLeechbook andOld English herbals (Anglo-Saxon, tenth-eleventhcentury), Regimen Sanitatis (Italian, tenth century), Physiciansof Myddvai (Welsh, fourteenth century), and various editionsof [H]ortus Sanitatis (1491) based on the German HerbariusMaguntie impressus of 1484 and Herbarius zu Teutsch of 1485.The latter monographs were intended to treat of cheap andhomely remedies for the use of the poor, as most herbs listed inthese books were native or garden plants, while very few exoticremedies were described in details.A glimpse of medieval Slavic herbal tradition could befound in the tenth-eleventh century manuscripts Izborniki(Anthologies, transcribed in 1073 and 1076 for PrinceSvyatoslav of Kyiv from manuscripts that had belonged toTsar Simeon of Bulgaria) that described medicinal uses ofseveral plants, including henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), hemlock(Conium maculatum), and wormwood (Artemisia absinthium).Subsequent herbal manuscripts (Ua: travnyk, zilejnyk, vertograd,Pl: zielnik) from sixteenth to eighteenth centuries often combinedtraditional herbal medicines with irrational magical applications.For example, while the seventeenth century vertograd describedmanagement of fever and pain with cabbage (Brassica oleracea)and beet (Beta vulgaris) leaves, and infection diseases with onion(Allium cepa) and garlic (Allium sativum), it also prescribed amixture of horse and goat manure to cure alopecia in 3 days(Krylov, 1985). Nonetheless, these manuscripts served duringthe late Middle Ages as veritable manuals of practical herbalmedicine. Their text and images were usually mechanicallytranscribed from earlier works of the most varied provenance,while the successive owners often enriched the contents withpersonal observations and experiences.OLDEST HERBALS PRINTED IN THECARPATHIAN FORELANDFoundation of Prague University in 1348 and Krakow Universityin 1364 provided diverse educational opportunities for wealthyFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 295217Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicineslocal families of Polish and Ruthenian descent, and led to theexpansion of local medicinal and apothecary tradition. Krakow,and later Lviv, quickly developed into two influential medievalcenters of apothecary, with former also serving as an importantpublishing site of printed herbal texts.Here, six major monographs describing the use of medicinalplants were published between 1532 and 1613 (Table 1). Thefirst one was a Latin reprint of De Herbarum Virtutibus (Naples,1477) with plants names translated into Polish for the first timeby Simon de Lowicz in 1532. Its significance lies in the factthat it was the first document of such length to indicate arenewed interest on this subject and to reveal direct influenceof Dioscorides and Pliny. Even though there was no evidenceof experimentation, and whether or not the author actually everattempted to use any of the herbs of which he wrote, this herbalhad a tremendous influence on medical and botanical literaturefrom the early Middle Ages (Flood, 1976). One testimonialto the wider influence Macer had on subsequent medical andbotanical commentators was a large number of translations ofthe herbal into vernacular languages and dialects. Its popularitywas likely partially due to the selection of predominantly nativeEuropean plants (39) or medicinal herbs cultivated in thegardens (25) over the exotic plants (13) that were difficult toprocure.Stefan Falimirz (Falimir, a Ruthenian courtier to JanTenczynski, the Duke of Podola in Krasnik) compiled variousLatin [H]ortus Sanitatismanuscripts, translated them into Polish,and released a first popular encyclopedia of traditional medicinesentitled O ziolach i o mocy ich (On herbs and their power)in Krakow (1534). The subjects covered herbs and herbalmedicines (including the first use of Polish term wodkameaning\"little water\" to describe high proof spirit distilled from grain),medicinal properties of animals and minerals, obstetrics, surgery,and were profusely illustrated with over 550 mostly originalwoodcuts. Plants were described in a set of 261 articles onEuropean and 69 exotic herbal remedies. Descriptions of plantsand their use, however, were mostly translations from theprevious sources and likely unknown to the author (Elbanowski,2014). This became very clear when compared to other chaptersdescribing animals, where Stefan provided extensive and originaldetails on local fishes, a subject apparently of great familiarityto the author. Specifically, Stefan stated, \"Because we live inPoland, there is a need to know characteristics and use of Polishfishes, as we use them regularly. The ones that help, the ones thatharm, the good, the better, and the worst.\" This statement for thefirst time indicated the emerging perception of inadequacy ofcontemporary Latinmanuscripts that lacked local knowledge andtradition.HieronimSpiczynski ofWielun (a wealthy Polish councilmanin Krakow) attempted an adaptation of Stefan Falimirz's work bypublishing O ziolach tutecznych y zamorskich y o mocy ich (Onlocal and overseas herbs and their power, 1542) with improvedwoodcuts. The monograph contained similar and often identicaldescriptions of several medical guides to practical use of herbalremedies. The catalog of herbs was focused on local plants listedunder Polish and Latin names, with a shorter list of exotic plantsidentified only in Latin. Compared to other herbals, it containednarrower descriptions of plant species with no mention of theirorigin or occurrence.Marcin Siennik (Merten Heuwrecher, a wealthy merchantof German origin in Krakow) compiled another adaptation ofFalimirz's herbal 26 years later as Herbarz to jest ziol tutecznych,postronnych i zamorskich opisanie (Herbal as description oflocal, foreign and overseas plants, 1568). Quick comparisonamong these editions revealed minor changes in the order ofthe chapters, woodcuts, and plant names. Siennik held neither aprofessional title nor a degree, and seemingly edited books solelyto make income in accordance with publisher's instructions. Theonly freedom that he enjoyed was expanding the list of plantnicknames, to which he contributed many new names, howeverboth descriptions and uses of various remedies were transcribedintact, together with all previous errors and omissions.

Plants were listed in Latin alphabetical order and wereheavily influenced by independent translations from DioscoridesMateria medica and Fuchs Cometraii insignes. Among those,only 259 chapters described wild native plants characteristic ofthe Polish countryside. The woodcuts, however, were the sameones used in Siennik herbal to depict 240 local herbs-and forthis reason, the rest of the herbal remedies were illustratedby woodcuts that were repeated or omitted altogether. Theindividual reports lacked a particular order of presentation, withsome chapters organized by location, description and use, whileothers discussed herbal properties prior to their looks and origins(Rostafinski, 1888).Szymon Syrenius (Syreniusz, Syrenski) of Oswiencim, agraduate of Krakow and Padua Universities, moved to Lvivand established his medical office there in 1578."
