Their skin is less permeable to benzo[a]pyrene than the skin of haired mice. Moreover, a prolonged in vitro hydration of their skin can generate a consistent increase in permeability, particularly to polar or ionized solutes. The C57BL/6N mice were used in order to emphasize the differences between pigmented skin model and the SKH-1's ones.Corneometry is a non-invasive technique which is able to estimate the hydration level of the skin surface (mainly at the stratum corneum level). The measurements associ-ated to this technique offer valuable information onto the modifications of the dielectric constant, due to skin surface hydration changing. So, this method presents a great deal of interest in dermatological and cosmetic applications, but also in formulation, claim support and efficacy testing of moisturizers. Corneometry is of great importance in objec-tive clinical diagnosis, as well as for monitoring therapies. The obtained results from the Corneometric study showed a significant decrease of the skin's hydration level in both types of mice, as well as for both studied aggressors (inorganic and organic phases). This decrease was noticed after the first 24 hours after application of the test solution, in both animal models. The decrease of this parameter may be associated to some toxicity signs, or may indicate the apparition of different injuries at skin level. It is important to note that in the case of the mice topically treated with the inorganic phase, some skin colour changes were noticed. Nowadays, Tewametry is used for many purposes, in-cluding dermatology (for objective clinical diagnosis) and occupational medicine, for monitoring and detecting skin damages, as well as in the testing of cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals. Through this technique, the TEWL parameter is assessed. This parameter brings information onto the skin's intrinsic properties, especially as its water barrier function. The measurements evaluate the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly, by means of temperature and relative humidity. Great val-ues of this parameter indicate that the water barrier func-tion of the skin become inefficient, or even some stratum corneous deteriorations. It was found that increased TEWL values can be associated with different skin diseases, but could be also induced by different chemical compounds. The evolution of the TEWL parameter was studied both for the inorganic phase solution and the organic one. The obtained results indicate a significant decrease of this parameter in both cases. In the case of both animal mod-els, it was noticed that the organic phase induced cutane-ous damages after only 2 weeks after exposition (2 weeks). However, the progress of lesions was slightly decreased when medical treatment was applied at this stage.ConclusionModifications of skin surface hydration level, and of the TEWL parameter were induced by the topical applica-tion of inorganic and organic phase solutions resulted from the Cosorb process. These results were more obvious in the case of the SKH1 mice model, and could be associated with the first signs of a short-term pathology at the skin's level.AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by the PN-II-PT-PC-CA-2013-4-0612 grant, nr. 110/2014 (REMACAT).ReferencesChadeesingh, R., 2011.

The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly supports breastfeed-ing for newborns from birth until 6 months postpartum as a global public health recommendation. Sometimes mothers are unable to make enough milk for the infant feeding and in such a case, milk-based infant formulas might be used as supplement to breast milk or may also be used as substi-tute if breastfeeding is impossible. Human milk provides the normative standard for infant nutrition with its unique composition that differs from infant formulas, although nu-trient composition of infant formulas is generally based to have similar functional properties as breast milk. Infant formula is a product based on milk of cows or other animals and/or other ingredients which have been proven to be suitable for infant feeding. Nowadays, a wide variety of infant formulas are available, so its nutritional safety and adequacy should be scientifically demonstrated to support normal growth and development of infants, es-pecially during the first 6 month of age. Infant formula is not officially a pharmaceutical prod-uct, though in many cases the manufacturers are pharma-ceutical companies. Regulatory bodies around the world agree that continual nutrient analysis is crucial in infant formulas quality control. The nutritional composition of all infant formulas must fulfill the global standards recom-mended by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroen-terology, Hepatology and Nutrition's (ESPGHAN) interna-tional expert group that was commissioned by The Codex Alimentarius Commission. These documents contain data about minimum and maximum values of nutrient contents in infant formulas with the goal to provide safe and nu-tritionally adequate infant formula products that meet the nutritional requirements of healthy babies during the first months of life until the introduction of appropriate comple-mentary feeding (Owens et al., 2012).Thiamine (vitamin B1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2) are nutritional components present in both breast milk and in-fant formulas which support normal infant growth. Thia-mine pyrophosphate as biologically active form of vitamin B1, is a cofactor for a number of key enzymes in Krebs cy-cle and in pentose phosphate pathway. Riboflavin is a pre-cursor of the flavin coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleo-tide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which par-ticipate in oxidation-reduction reactions in many meta-bolic pathways. As FAD is part of the respiratory chain, riboflavin is central to energy production. Both vitamins are essential for development of infant tissues, function of muscles, heart, nervous system and mental activity. Also they are involved in carbohydrates, lipid and protein me-tabolism, red blood cell formation, respiration, antibody production and normal infant growth (Lalic et al., 2014; Sunaric et al., 2012). The levels of these vitamins in infant formulas are very important for term infants during the first 6 months of life, and especially for pre-term or low birth weight infants.The aim of this work was to determine thiamine and ri-boflavin content in some infant formulas available in Ser-bian pharmacies, as well as to define the level to which these infant formulas comply with the ESPGHAN recom-mendations and with Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) for infants.S3 PP 128276Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 275 - 276 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsMaterials and methodsTen most commonly used standard infant formulas were purchased from a local pharmacy. All analyzed brands were initial milk-based formulas designed for infant con-sumption during the first 6 months of life. Powdered sam-ples were dissolved and prepared following manufactur-er's instructions, in order to attain vitamins concentrations as given on the label.Samples preparation procedures and vitamins content analysis were done according to our previously published methods with minor modifications (Lalic et al., 2014; Sunaric et al., 2012). The percentage of compliance has been calculated with the mean minimum and maximum levels of vitamins according to ESPGHAN recommendations using the for-mula: Composition in 100 ml infant formula/ ESPGHAN mean value by 100 ml x 100.Results and discussionVitamins contents in analyzed samples were expressed as micrograms (mg) per 100 ml of prepared milk, as given on the label. The concentrations of thiamine and ribofla-vin in herein examined infant formulas were in the range of 57.5-91.3 mg/100 ml and 106.7-224.8 mg/100 ml, re-spectively. Also, values obtained for thiamine and ribofla-vin content in all samples accounted for over 88.5% of the values declared on the product label, with good precision (RSD < 1.8%, n = 5).The amounts of both vitamins in all analyzed samples exceeded the minimum requirements according to ESP-GHAN recommendations (48 mg/100 ml for thiamine and 180 mg/100 ml for riboflavin). The percentage of compli-ance was in the range of 39.9-63.4% for vitamin B1 and 19.8-41.6% for vitamin B2, respectively. These results were within the acceptable limits found in most of the lit-erature and very similar compared to the data in other stud-ies conducted according to ESPGHAN recommendations.Recommended Dietary Intake for infants (0-6 months old) are 200 mg/day for thiamine and 300 mg/day for ribo-flavin. Thus, assuming that the advised daily intake of 500 ml of prepared infant formula is optimal for 0- to 6-month infants, all analyzed samples supply much higher lev-els than the values established by the RDI for B1 (143.7-228.2%) and B2 (177.8-374.6%).ConclusionIn this work, thiamine and riboflavin content in differ-ent infant formulas available in Serbian pharmacies was determined. Levels of both vitamins in all samples were consistent with the values declared on the products label. Results of this study revealed that analyzed infant formu-las comply with the nutritional needs of infants with regard to vitamins B1 and B2. Their content in all samples ex-ceeds the RDI values, so there is an excess of these nutri-ents supplementation. Moreover, the satisfactory compli-ance with ESPGHAN recommendations was observed so analyzed milk-based formulas might be used as adequate breast milk supplements or substitutes.AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by grant TR 31060 from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological De-velopment of the Republic of Serbia.References Lalic, J., Denic, M., Sunaric, S., Kocic, G., Trutic, N., Mitic, S., Jovanovic, T., 2014.

The determination of pesticides in fruits and vegetables has always been an important issue in ensuring the quality of the products, given the fact that residues of pesticides in raw food could affect the consummator (Abbassy et al., 2014). Neonicotinoid insecticides, which have a high affinity for insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Matsuda et al., 2001) are widely used to protect against a broad range of pests, including aphids, whitefly, thrips and mealy bugs. Their physicochemical properties make them useful for a wide range of application techniques, including seed treatment, soil drench, and foliar and stem application (Tomlin, 2009). Because some pesticides can be applied to crops up to the day before harvest, the residual pesticide concentrations in crops immediately after harvest may be relatively high. Among the neonicotinoid pesticides commercially available, imidacloprid and acetamiprid are of common use in our region. This study focuses on the residuals of acetamiprid on green peppers (Capsicum annum L.) one of the most important vegetable crops in our country. Various methods for neonicotinoid insecticide residue analysis have been reported, demonstrating that acetamiprid could be analyzed by both gas and liquid chromatography (Mateu-Sanchez et al., 2003; Navalon et al., 1997; Obana et al., 2002). According to the recommendation issued by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/WHO the Maximum Residual Levels (MLR) for acetamiprid in vegetables should not exceed 0.2 mg/kg. Materials and methodsThe study was conducted in a ventilated and temperature regulated greenhouse. The surface involved approximately 250 m2 and was divided in three main sections consisting of 30 plants each: S1 - untreated plants; S2 - plants treated with the minimal dose of acetamiprid (Mospilan(r)) 0,02%; and S3 - treated with the maximal dose of acetamiprid (Mospilan(r)) 0,04%. Considering that the Pre Harvest Interval (PHI) for acetamiprid is 7 days, the residual levels have been measured up to 9 days after spraying with two different concentrations of Mospilan(r). Sampling was conducted in compliance with the guidelines published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CCPR, 2009).Approximately 300 g of vegetables were chopped into small pieces and blended in a homogenization apparatus so that a fine paste is formed. A portion of 5 g was accurately weighted and mixed with 10 g of hard-powdered synthetic magnesium-silica gel (Florisil(r)) in a mortar. Cleanup was carried out using a chromatographic column. The column (40 cm x 20 mm) was carefully prepared placing at the end glass wool and a thin layer of anhydrous sodium sulphate (Kadenezki et al., 1992). The column was then packed by transferring the mixture prepared in the mortar using a funnel. Extract was eluted with 50 ml of ethyl acetate and acetone mixture and elute was evaporated to dryness on rotary evaporator and reconstituted in 1ml hexane. The cleaned extracts were analyzed on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with capillary column using an electron capture detector (ECD) (Chandra et al., 2010). Analysis of acetamiprid was carried out in a 30 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter and 0.25 um film thickness coated DB-5 column. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 ml min-1 flow. The injector was set at constant temperature of 260 degC and the detector temperature was S3 PP 129278Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 277 - 278 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentations300 degC. The initial oven temperature was set at 170degC (1 min isothermal) then the temperature increased with a ramp of 10 degC/ min till 280 degC and subsequently isothermal for 15 minutes. The injection volume was 1ul. All the solvent used were HPLC grade.Results and discussionThe compound of interest was identified by comparing its retention time with respect to technical grade reference standard. The elution time for acetamiprid under the chosen chromatographic conditions was 7.29 min. The quantitative determination was carried out with the help of a calibration curve drawn from chromatographic experiments with standard solutions. The limit of quantification (LoQ) was measured by the signal to noise ratio and was 0.01 mg/ml (ppm). The method was validated. Linear calibration curve was found between peak areas and analyte concentration in the whole range of the study. The linear regression (y = a + bx) parameters for method calibration were taken and the regression coefficients (R2) was near 0.998, which allows the quantification of this compound by the method of external standardization. Accuracy and precision were calculated based on repeated injections (n=5) and the RSD was 0.51%. Recovery studies were performed to examine the efficacy of extraction and clean up. Untreated peppers were spiked with known concentration of the pure insecticide standard solution and extraction and cleanup were performed as described earlier. The recovery was 93%. Monitoring the degradation of acetamiprid, revealed that the samples treated with the lowest dose of acetamiprid (0.02%) reached the MRL within seven days, whereas the samples treated with the highest dose (0.04%), could not reach the recommended MRL values for the same period of time."
