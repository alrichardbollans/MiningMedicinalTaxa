Linalyl acetate did notshow affinity to the serotonin transporter (data not shown). ***p < 0.0001 vs.the lowest concentration tested.Serotonin Transporter Assay([3H]-Citalopram Binding Assay)The effects of LEO on the SERT are displayed in Table 1,showing moderate activity in this assay (citalopram IC50value was 1.3 nM). LEO significantly displaced 3H-citalopramfrom binding to the SERT in a dose-dependent manner,which means that LEO might have an antidepressant-like effect via this specific transporter. This effect wasalso detected for linalool, one of the main constituentsof lavender essential oil (Figure 1), but not for linalylacetate.Affinity for GABAA Receptor ([3H]-Ro15-1788 Binding Assay)The affinity for the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor, whichmay lead to a nerve calming effect, was not detected (Table 1).LEO had no effect in binding this ionotropic receptor.Clonazepam (IC500.002 nM) was used as positive controldrug.FIGURE 2 | Affinity of lavender essential oil (A) and linalool and linalylacetate (B) for the glutamate NMDA receptor.

This essential oil is one of the best-selling natural remedies and a common therapeutic tool forphysiotherapists and chiropractors.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 280351Lopez et al. Lavender Pharmacological MechanismsFIGURE 5 | Effect of 1ul/ml lavender essential oil (LEO) onbeta-amyloid induced toxicity on SH-SY5Y cells at 0 (A), 2 (B), and 24 h(C). **p < 0.01 vs. 15uM beta-amyloid (medium only).There has recently been an increase in the use of naturaltherapies due to well-known side effects of common CNS drugs,such as (BZD) and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors(SSRI). Although BZD and SSRI have been widely usedin neuropharmacology, there is a need of developing newtherapeutic tools that play a role both in prevention andtreatment of mild CNS disorders.In this sense, aromatherapy and some essentials oils have beenused for decades to induce nerve-calming effects and mood-enhancing properties (Dobetsberger and Buchbauer, 2011).Aromatherapy is a form of complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM) that uses plant essentials oils to affect the moodor health of the patient (Wheatley, 2005) and some clinicalstudies suggest that inhaled or topically applied essential oilslike lavender exert psychological and central nervous systemeffects (Perry and Perry, 2006). It has also recently been statedthat essential oils may behave as antidepressants due to playingan important role on neurotransmitter pathways, mainly in theserotonin system (Lv et al., 2013).Certain studies have reported pharmacological propertiesof essential oils but there is little research on the molecularmechanisms underlying the CNS effects. The ability of lavenderessential oil to interact with neuropharmacological targets, suchas MAO-A, the SERT and ionotropic receptors (GABAA andNMDA) has been tested, as well as the protective potential againstneurotoxic agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, malonate andamyloid peptide.It was surprising that LEO had the capacity to bindto the NMDA receptor, which was measured through theCGP39653 binding assay. CGP39653 is a competitive antagonist,being currently the ligand of choice for labeling NMDAreceptors. NMDA receptors are neurochemically classified asionotropic glutamate receptors (iGLURs) and are involved incertain neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy,sustained-seizure damage, Parkinsonism, etc. For this reasoniGLURs are considered pharmacological targets in drug researchand development. LEO was able to displace CGP39653 bindingin a dose-dependent mode, which means that this oil may exertnerve-calming effects via modulating NMDA receptors. This isthe first time that this affinity is reported and this fact couldexplain the anti-agitation properties that have been found forthese products in animal and some clinical studies (Bradley et al.,2009; Faturi et al., 2010; Kasper et al., 2010; Tsang and Ho,2010; Woelk and Schlaefke, 2010; Chioca et al., 2011; Goes et al.,2012; Hritcu et al., 2012; Schuwald et al., 2013). NMDA-receptoractivation by glutamate is also involved in neurotoxicity so ouressential oil might exert neuroprotection through the blockade ofthis ionotropic receptor.According to our data, these results are in the range of othernatural products that have been reported to show activity in thistarget (Cho et al., 2001; Pedersen et al., 2008; Marchetti et al.,2011).Lavender essential oil has shown activity in animal andhuman studies but according to Koulivand et al. (2013), due tomethodological inadequacies, small sample sizes, variations onadministration methods or the absence of placebos or controlgroups in the studies, more standard experiments are needed toconfirm the benefits of lavender in CNS disorders. The molecularmechanisms involved in lavender effects have been suggestedin other studies. For example, Huang et al. (2009) suggestthat lavender essential oil reversibly inhibited GABA-inducedcurrents in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-1 mg/mL),whereas no inhibition of NMDA- or AMPA-induced currentswas noted. In a recent study, Schuwald et al. (2013) identified astandarized lavender essential oil (Silexan) as a potent anxiolyticinhibiting voltage dependent calcium channels in synaptosomes,primary hippocampal neurons and stably overexpressing celllines, in the same range as pregabaline.Lavender essential oil is known to contain monoterpenes likelinalool and linalyl acetate, which seem to be responsible for theactivity according to our data and previous works (Cline et al.,2008; Linck et al., 2010; Souto-Maior et al., 2011). The capacity oflinalool to interact with the glutamatergic system and the NMDAreceptor is not new as it has been previously described by otherFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 280352Lopez et al. Lavender Pharmacological Mechanismsauthors (Elisabetsky et al., 1995, 1999; Silva Brum et al., 2001;Aprotosoaie et al., 2014); however, the ability of linalyl acetateto bind the NMDA receptor has not been found to be reportedin previous works. It seems that lavender essential oil anxiolyticeffects is due to the fact that its main monoterpenes, linalool andlinalyl acetate, interact with the NMDA receptor.It is very difficult to establish structure activity relationshipsbecause linalyl acetate was inactive in the SERT assay, whereas theactivity of this compound was slightly higher than linalool in theNMDA binding receptor assay. Linalool and linalyl acetate aresecondary metabolites classified as monoterpenes with a similarstructure consisting of a linear hydrocarbon chain of 10 carbons(linalool) or 11 (linalyl acetate), being linalyl acetate the esterof linalool. The free hydroxyl group in linalool seems to bedeterminant for the activity in the SERT. On the contrary, theactivity on the NMDA receptor is increased when the acetategroup exists in the compound named linalyl acetate; limonene,another monoterpenic compound found at high concentrationin Citrus essential oils, has also shown anxiolytic-like activitywith other targets involved (de Almeida et al., 2012; Lima et al.,2013).Other essential oils have been demonstrated to producechanges in brain neurotransmitters which could explain its anti-agitation properties. For example, ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata)essential oil has shown anxiolytic effects in male mice decreasingthe dopamine concentration in the striatum and increasing theserotonin concentration in the hippocampus (Zhang et al., 2016).Surprisingly, linalool is one of the main components of thisessential oil. The essential oils obtained from Eugenia uniflora hasalso demonstrated antidepressant-like activities in animal modelswith the serotonergic and adrenergic systems being involved(Victoria et al., 2013). Melissa officinalis essential oil, which isalso used as a natural sedative, has demonstrated a depressanteffect on neurotransmission but no inhibition of NMDA- orAMPA-induced currents was detected (Abuhamdah et al., 2008).Citrus aurantifolia (bitter orange) essential oil has also exhibitedanxiolytic-like effects mediated by 5-HT(1A)-receptors (Costaet al., 2013). All these works put forward the idea that theserotonergic system is involved in the nerve calming effects ofessential oils.We have also observed that lavender and linalool inhibitsserotonergic targets, such as the SERT, which might explain whylavender has shown antidepressant-like effects in animal andhuman models (Cavanagh and Wilkinson, 2002; Akhondzadeshet al., 2003; Hritcu et al., 2012). However, we did not observeeffects on the GABAA-receptor, which is in accordance withresults from a recent study (Chioca et al., 2013).This study has been completed using neuroblasts from neuralhuman tissue (SH-SY5Y) exposed to different neurotoxic agents.Lavender was able to protect the cells from the toxic insultgenerated by hydrogen peroxide although it was not capableto reduce malonate toxicity. Results from amyloid-b peptideinduced toxicity are not conclusive. However, this activity seemsto be in accordance with a previous study where lavenderessential oil showed neuroprotective properties against hydrogenperoxide induced toxicity in PC12 cells (Xu et al., 2016). Theauthors conclude that lavender protected the cells reducing LDH,NO release, intracellular ROS accumulation and MMP loss.CONCLUSIONOur study reveals for the first time that lavender exerts receptorbinding affinities with a relevant activity on the NMDA receptor.According to our data, we can state that the anti-agitation andantidepressant activities of lavender may be attributed at least inpart to the NMDA receptor modulation as well as an inhibitionof the SERT. Lavender essential oil also protected SH-SY5Y cellsfrom hydrogen peroxide induced neurotoxicity.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSVL conceived the study, performed in vitro pharmacologicalactivities (enzyme inhibition tests, affinities to receptors andtransporters), carried out data analysis and wrote themanuscript.BN run the NMDA activity assay.
