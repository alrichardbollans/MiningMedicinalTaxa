      "text": "Having in mind that chemical composition in vari-ous samples of the essential oil mostly differs due to the influence of temperature, and/or geographic region (Jo and Kim, 2005), in depth statistical analyses using prin-cipal component analysis (PCA), followed by Hierarchi-cal Cluster Analysis (HCA) (calculated with Ward`s crite-rion and sorted by size), partial least square - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and partial least square (PLS) analysis were carried out. PCA applied on data related to all 93 identified con-stituents of the oil resulted with mathematical model with six principal components that explained 99.5% of the total variations, with no identified outliers in the model. Den-drogram created by subsequent HCA pointed that analyzed samples could be clustered in two groups.The samples in the first cluster were correlated with a-pinene and b-myrcene, while the second cluster was linked to germacrene D, b-elemene, trans-E-caryophyllene, a-humulene, g-elemene, b-cadinene, g-cadinene. PLS-DA preceded PLS analysis with a rationale for discriminatory variables identification. Nine components (germacrene D, a-pinene, b-myrcene, sabinene, a-humulene, b-elemene, trans-E-caryophyllene, g-elemene and g-cadinene) showed statistical significance and hence were identified as discriminatory variables. Conducted PLS analysis pointed to the relation of discriminatory variables with the year and geographical region of harvesting, as well as the mean maximal, mean average and mean minimal temperature in the month of collection (October). The PLS analysis suggested a model with four components that explained 94% (R2Y) of the variables with prediction (Q2) of 90.2%. Statistical analysis of the results enabled determination of significant variables and establishment of correlation between the oil chemical compositions and/or the harvesting year, geographical region and mean temperature values. ConclusionThe GC/MS analyses of the chemical composition of the essential oils isolated from the berries of Macedonian juniper revealed presence of 93 components in total. HCA resulted with dendrogram where the samples were grouped in two clusters, one correlated with two monoterpene hy-drocarbons, and second with the sesquiterpene hydrocar-bons fraction. With PLS-DA, nine discriminatory variables were identified with statistical significance. Generally, the chemical composition of the juniper oil from RM is affect-ed by the temperature and/or the year of harvesting.ReferencesAssessment report on Juniperus communis L., aetheroleum, EMA/HMPC/12401/2010.Chatzapoulou, P., Kastsiotis, S.T., 1993.

Although there are around 1000 species of Salvia, only the pharmacopoe-ial herbs (Salvia officinalis L. and Salvia fruticosa Mill-er) have significant commercial importance (Dincer et al., 2013).Essential oil, polyphenols and terpenes are considered as main chemical compounds responsible for the pharma-cological activity of these species (Kintzios, 2000; Ramos et al., 2010).S. fruticosa (Greek sage) is an endemic species of the Eastern Mediterranean basin and is the most widespread sage species in Greece (Kintzios, 2000; Ramos et al., 2010). The leaves of this herb have been used for treat-ment of various skin, blood, and infectious ailments (Ali-Shtayeh et al., 2000) while the essential oil is effective against different microorganisms. Greek sage posses hy-poglycemic effect and can be used against inflammations, hepatitis, and tuberculosis (Pitarokili et al., 2003). However, the most studies have focused on the essen-tial oil, while there are few reports regarding the phenolic composition (Kintzios, 2000). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the polyphenolic profile of 15 different wild growing pop-ulations of S. fruticosa from Greece and Albania. Materials and methodsPlant material (Salvia fruticosa Mill., Lamiaceae), was collected from 15 different indigenous populations from nine different locations from Greece (Kavoussi - 2, Rhi-zoscaro - 2, and Vrysses - 2) and Albania (Porto Palermo-Qeparo - 4, Llogora -1 , Dhermi - 1, Borsh - 1, Ilias Vuno - 1, and Palase - 1). The leaves were air dried, packed in pa-per bags and kept in a dark and cold place until analysis. Plant identity was verified and voucher specimens were de-posited at the Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Phar-macy, Skopje, R. Macedonia.The 70% methanolic extracts were prepared in ultra-sonic bath by the method described by Cvetkovikj et al. (2013).Qualitative analysis was carried out using an HPLC system from the Agilent 1100 series with photo-diode ar-ray and mass detector (G2445A Ion-Trap Mass Spectrom-eter) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) (Ag-ilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), controlled by LCMSD software (Agilent, v.4.1). MS data were acquired in the negative ionization mode. The eluents were: formic acid (1%, V/V) (A) and acetonitrile (B) and the separations were achieved using the method established by Cvetkovikj et al. (2013), on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB RP C-18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mm, Agilent, Germany), protected with a guard column (4 mm x 4.6 mm, RP-18, 5 mm, Ag-ilent, Germany). The phenolic compounds were identified using their UV and mass spectral data (deprotonated mo-lecular ions and their corresponding fragments and losses). S5 PP 242508Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 507 - 508 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsResults and discussionWith HPLC-DAD-ESI-MSn, qualitative character-ization of 15 different extracts from Greek sage was per-formed and a total of 37 different compounds were detect-ed. The detected compounds were classified in five groups: 12 derivates of hydroxycinnamic acid were the predom-inant group, followed by the group of 12 flavone glyco-sides of luteolin or apigenin, six phenolic diterpenes, five flavones and only one flavanone glycosides of hispidulin. Rosmarinic acid together with the flavone, nepetin (6-hydroxyluteolin 6-methyl ether), and the phenolic di-terpene (rosmanol isomer) were detected in all 15 exam-ined S. fruticosa samples. Thirteen compounds (luteo-lin diglucoronide, luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, hydroxyluteolin 7-gucuronide, apigenin 7-O-rutinoside, hispidulin7-O-rutinoside, apigenin 7-O-glu-coside, apigenin glucoronide, salvianolic acid K, rosma-rinic acid, rosmanol isomer, carnosol isomer and eupato-rin) were found in amounts higher than 5.00% in at least one population and were considered as principal compo-nents of the methanolic extracts. Rosmarinic acid was pre-dominant constituent (32.72-59.88%), followed by luteolin 7-O-glucuronide (6.18-19.35%), salvianolic acid K (5.73-21.62%) and rosmanol isomer (1.48-12.56%). Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the 13 polyphenolic compounds detected in the extracts from S. fruticosa from nine different localities from two Balkan countries (Greece and Albania) revealed that there wasn't a statistically significant difference in the polyphenolic com-position of the S. fruticosa populations, regardless its ori-gin.The obtained results for the polyphenolic characteriza-tion of the methanolic extracts were in accordance with the available literature. Ecarschou et al. (2002) identified ros-marinic acid as major constituent in the ethanolic extracts while hispidulin, savigenin, cirsimaritin and the diterpenes casrnosic acid, carnosol and 12-methoxycarnosic acid were predominant compounds of the ethyl acetate extracts that showed antifungal activity (Exarchou et al., 2015). In eth-yl-acetate and n-butanolic extracts from S. fruticosa from Crete, Greece, rosmarinic acid was not detected but deri-vates of ferulic acid and flavone glycosides as well as de-rivates of luteolin were identified and were considered as dominant components (Atwi et al., 2016).ConclusionWith LC/DAD/ESI-MSn analysis of 15 specimens of S. fruticosa from Greece and Albania, 37 polypheno-lic compounds were detected, where as predominant group were considered the hydroxycinnamic acid derivates, with rosmarinic acid present with more than 30% in all anal-ysed populations. The flavone glycosides of luteolin and apigenin were second dominant group. Qualitative anal-ysis showed no statistically significant difference in the polyphenolic composition indicating that the polypheno-lic profile of S. fruticosa is more species allied rather than locality related.ReferencesAli-Shtayeh, M.S., Yaniv, Z., Mahajna, J., 2000.

Sarajevo, Igmanska 38, 71320 Vogosca, Bosnia and Herzegovina* elvira-kb@hotmail.comIntroductionThe value of medicinal plants to the mankind is very well proven. It is estimated that 70 to 80% of the people worldwide rely chiefly on traditional health care system and largely on herbal medicines (Farnsworth and Soejarto, 1991; Shanley and Luz, 2003; Shengji, 2002).Natural medicinal raw material of plant origin has ap-plication in therapy of the all pharmacological indication. More and more, they are taking integral part of the official pharmacy and because of their use in official therapy, they rising to a higher level continually.However, the application of the medicinal plant raw material in dentistry is much smaller. Although, stomatology can be classified as medical or health community, still it has own specifications. For this reason, it can be induced the possibility for using plant ma-terial in treatment of caries, dental plaque, gingivitis, peri-odontal disease. The application is possible for different oral inflammations as they represent anti-inflammatory, an-timicotic and antiviral agent. Furthermore, it is important the possibility for applica-tion, different plant material and their products in prepara-tion for oral hygiene. Permanent progress of stomatology as scientific area results with introduction of a new tech-nology and new synthetic drugs but these impose also the use of potential natural medical raw material.The carriers of pharmacological effects in plant mate-rial are different chemical substances: tannins, flavonoids, saponins, anthraquinones and their products: essential oil, mucus, balsams etc."
