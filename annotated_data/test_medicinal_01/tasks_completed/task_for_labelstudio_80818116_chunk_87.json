Macedonia* ngeskovski@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionIn the last decades, the struggle for efficient targeted drug therapy and diagnostics paved the road to clinical use of nanomedicines. However, the research and understand-ing of the interactions among the engineered nanomateri-als and the biological environment, to date, presents quite a challenge. It is becoming clear that, when placed into a biological environment, nanoparticles initiate a cascade of interactions with the biomacromolecules resulting in the formation of the 'protein corona' (a layer(s) of proteins adsorbed on the nanoparticles surface) (Monopoli et al., 2011). These interactions can alter the secondary structure of the adsorbed proteins promoting instability and/or expo-sure of new epitopes at the protein surface, thus giving rise to unexpected biological responses (Calzolai et al., 2010). Undoubtedly, the protein corona modifies the nanoparticles interface and thus affects their biological fate and overall performance. Therefore the characterization of the interac-tions at the nano-bio interface will greatly influence the un-derstanding and capability for prediction of the nanoparti-cles in vivo behavior. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of the surface properties of different polymer-ic nanoparticles upon their interaction with a model pro-tein (bovine serum albumin - BSA) in a binary nanoparti-cle - BSA system.Materials and methodsMaterialsPLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw 148KDa and Mw 22KDa) was purchased from Akina Inc (USA). Lutrol F127 - Poly(ethylenoxide)-block-poly(propyleneoxide)-block-poly(ethyleneoxide) was kindly donated by BASF (Germa-ny) and BSA was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA). Bradford Protein assay dye reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad (USA). All other reagents and chemicals used were of analytical grade.MethodsNanoparticles preparation procedureNanoparticle formulations were prepared from PLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw 70,000:8,000:70,000Da) - NP1 and PLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw 6,000:10,000:6,000Da) - NP2, using the nanoprecipitation method, as described previous-ly (Dimchevska et al., 2015).Quantification of bovine serum albumin adsorptionAll samples were diluted to concentration of 2mg/ml and subsequently 1ml from each formulation was mixed with 1ml of 2mg/mL BSA solution in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The NP dispersions with BSA were incubated for 1h at 37degC in a water bath with horizontal shaking at 100 min-1. After the incubation, the samples were concentrated to 1mL using ultrafiltration tubes with pore size of 1000 kDa, and washed with phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Blank (BSA free) and control sample (without nanoparticles) were also used in the experiment. The amount of adsorbed BSA was indirectly quantified using the Bradford protein assay. Spectroscopic characterization of nanoparticle-bovine se-rum albumin interactionsThe samples were prepared as described above with additional freeze drying cycle (-40 degC, 0.055 mBar, FreeZ-S4 PP 173368Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 367 - 368 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsone 2.5 L, Labconco, USA) in order to remove the water. FTIR spectra of the samples were carried out using FT-IR spectrometer (660, Varian, USA). To calculate the rel-ative proportions of the different secondary structures of albumin, the spectral region of the Amide I (1700-1600 cm-1) was analyzed with appropriate software for spec-tral analysis (Grams32, Thermo, USA). Using Gauss-Lo-rentz transformation, six distinctive peaks of the second-ary protein structures were analyzed (b-sheets in spectral regions 1696-1690 cm-1, 1642-1624 cm-1 and 1618-1613 cm-1; b-turns in the spectral region 1685-1675 cm-1; a-helix in the region 1658-1654 cm-1; random coils in the region 1648-1640 cm-1). To avoid any influence of the vibration of the polymer chains in the region of Amide I, the spectra of empty nanoparticles were previously subtracted from the spectra of the samples with adsorbed albumin.Results and DiscussionThe results from the quantitative BSA adsorption stud-ies revealed that 24.6+-1.9 and 13.1+-0.9% of BSA were ad-sorbed on the surface of NP1 and NP2, respectively. The FTIR spectra of freeze dried BSA revealed broad band at 3287 cm-1 that originates from N-H bending vibra-tions (Amide A). The C-H bending of aliphatic chains can be noted on 2960 cm-1, 2933 cm-1 and 2875 cm-1. Strong C-O stretching vibration (Amide I) that originates from the am-ide bond in the peptide chain appears at 1645 cm-1 while the Amide II band (mainly N-H bending vibrations) is on 1516 cm-1. Several bands that represent mainly combinations of C-N stretching and N-H bending can be noticed in the region from 1400 cm-1 to 1200 cm-1. Distinctive blue shift of Am-ide I (1654 cm-1) in the spectra of NP1-BSA complex can be noticed, relative to the FTIR spectrum of BSA. Such shift of Amide I could be attributed to possible secondary structure changes of BSA that are initiated as a result of the interaction with the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, significant de-crease in the C-O antisymmetrical stretching vibrations from the PLGA blocks was noticed, indicating to possible growth of hydrophobicity in the microenvironment of surface ex-posed carbonyl groups. The FTIR spectrum of NP2-BSA complex reveals blue shift of Amide I and II relative to the bands on BSA spectrum. Additionally, there is a slight de-crease of the intensity of the carbonyl C-O vibrations band at 1756cm-1 and a red shift of the antisymmetrical C-O stretch-ing vibrations on the PEO chains (1087 and 955cm-1) relative to the respective bands in the spectrum of NP2. The curve fit-ting on Amide I in the previously mentioned FTIR spectra revealed that the secondary structure of the BSA molecule contains 35% a-helix, 32.5% b-sheets, 12% b-turns (short 4 amino acid segments that form antiparallel loops) and 20% of random coils. Having in mind that the spectrum was tak-en from freeze-dried sample of BSA, one can assume that the portion of a-helix will be reduced on the expense of the in-crease of b-sheets and random coils in the secondary struc-ture. The NP1-BSA and NP2-BSA demonstrated presence of 77.63% and 34.39% of a-helix, 11.51% and 31.76% of b-sheets, 10.8% and 17.74% of b-turns, 0.05% and 16.11% of random coils in the BSA molecule, respectively. Considering the above results one can assume that the behavior of BSA towards NP1 and NP2 is different, main-ly because of the differences in the density and PEO chain length of the nanoparticle hydrophilic corona. The PLGA/PEO ratio in NP1 and NP2 is 17.5:1 and 1.2:1, respectively. Having this in mind, it can be presumed that the PEO chain length and surface density can affect the accessibility of the hydrophobic nanoparticle core towards nonspecific interac-tions with BSA. The hydrophilic corona of NP2 is larger and more rigid and as such will be an effective steric barrier in the interaction of BSA with the hydrophobic PLGA core. The loss of a-helix in the secondary structure of BSA in the native BSA sample and NP2-BSA complex can be attributed to the freeze-drying stress of the BSA molecule that initiates hydrogen bonding redistribution in the secondary structure of the protein. The partially adsorbed BSA molecule won't be able to protect its intramolecular hydrogen bonds during the freeze drying process that will initiate the conversion of a-helix to random coils and b-sheets. On the other hand, the structure of the BSA that is adsorbed on the NP1 sur-face could be associated with its' native structure. The pres-ervation of the native structure during freeze drying is an-other indication of the hydrophobic nature of the NP1-BSA interactions resulting in significant contribution towards the maintenance of the BSA original hydrogen bonds.ConclusionThe results unambiguously point to the effect of the hydrophilic outer nanoparticle layer as a steric barrier for nanoparticle-BSA interactions. The formulations with low hydrophilic coverage expose the hydrophobic core and en-able strong hydrophobic binding with the proteins pres-ent in the corona. Such strong binding could result in ap-pearance of different new protein epitopes on the nano-bio interface and significantly alter the biological fate of the nanoparticles.ReferencesCalzolai, L., Franchini, F., Gilliland, D., Rossi, F., 2010.

Concerning to this, it is worth to mention here the experimentally confirmed effects, such as increased skin hydration after introducing in the diet linum usitatissimum oil (De Spirt et al., 2009). The linoleic and alpha-linolenic essential fatty acids are in-volved in restoring the cutaneous barrier, important in skin ceramides synthesis. Other authors have noted the favor-able effect of the linum usitatissimum oil on wound heal-ing, on an animal model (De Souza Franco et al., 2012). There are also experimental evidences regarding the ben-efits on skin excoriations. Additionally, the anti-inflamma-tory and even antibacterial effect leads some authors to cite flax oil as showing a positive effect on treating ringworm.On the other hand, theoretically, under the effect of lignans, (secoisolariciresinol diglucoside - SDG - the most abundant flax lignan) with estrogen-mimetic action, the oil of this species should have effects similar to other phytoes-trogens. This is the premise of our experimental study. The study aims to: (1) evaluate fatty acids in Linum usitatissimum oil, in order to be, at least, protective and nu-tritive for human skin, in topical application, (2) evidenc-ing the sebum-reducing capacity of linum oil, (3) observa-tion of a possible improvement of skin texture (a result of skin hydration), for the cases of seborrhea sicca (dry seb-orrhea).Materials and methodsLinseed oil was obtained from the seeds of the Alexin cultivar grown in the Didactic Station Timisoara of Banat's University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Med-icine Timisoara in 2014. The cutaneous study benefited from the enrollment for testing of 24 healthy female volun-teers, aged between 18 and 46, having oily and seborrhe-ic skin and the sebaceous glands were measured in terms of numbers and dimensions, by using the apparatus Pro-derm Analyser (NU SKIN, Provo, UT, USA). The evalua-tion of the cutaneous evolution was performed in the Der-matopharmacy and Cosmetology laboratory (University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara). The criteria for in-cluding the volunteers in the study were: (1) Written con-sent of the volunteers after they understood the test proce-dure, (2) Diagnostic of seborrhea or normal oily skin, based on clinical criteria, (3) Lack of any pathological complica-tions (eg. acne, seborrheic scaling dermatitis) situations in which the oil is potentially harmful (obstructive, comedo-genic, or irritating) (4) Elimination of intolerance, after a preliminary test of the oil at a topical skin application. The assessments with Proderm Analyzer were recorded after 7 days of therapy, at the times: 7, 14, 21 and 28 days respec-tively. For each volunteer, at each time point, were counted the colored points per skin field explored (number of over-sized sebaceous glands per cm2) and the average was cal-culated for each time unit, separately for seboreea oleossa and for seboreea sicca. S4 PP 174370Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 369 - 370 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsResults and discussionLinseed oil is characterized by a high content of linole-ic acid (0.313 mg / ml) and linolenic acid (0.214 mg / ml). The results are consistent with literature data mentioning a high concentration of linoleic acid in oil from linseed seeds cultivated in Romania but also in other countries. The daily use of linseed oil also produced an improvement in the ap-pearance of the skin, reducing the appearance of scaly skin to complete fade-out. There are no obvious differences be-tween the evolution of the seborrhea oleossa and the sicca during the test for the linum oil treated group, meaning that this oil has efficiency in both types of disorders.The most significant decrease of sebaceous glands number was registrered starting with the 14th day after the first treatment. The 14 days also represent the turnover of the sebocyte. In other words, after two weeks there are oth-er new sebocytes holding secretory activity under another hormonal stimulation, modified in the meantime. As a mat-ter of fact, the sebocyte is a cell with a prompt response to other pharmaceutical treatments as well, for example af-ter the treatment with topical retinoids the sebaceous se-cretion decreases dramatically, sometimes after only 7-10 days. The problem with retinoids, however, is their adver-sity to the epidermis, dryness and the erythema generated. ConclusionIn conclusion, linseed oil is one of the oldest natural remedies for skin nutrition. Recent studies show its ben-efits in scarring, in surgical wound healing optimization, in skin hydration and also in the domain of cutaneous ag-ing prevention.This study brings again linum usitatissimum oil in the foreground, this time for its sebum-reducing effect. This property is a confirmation of the hypothesis launched by the Lucas Meyer dermocosmetic laboratories, a property attributed to the lignans in flax seeds, known for their es-trogen-mimetic and implicitly anti-androgenic attributes, which means exactly an intervention on the hormonal mechanism of seborrhea. Our study opens a new prospect to lignans determinations, in different sort of linseeds, for a natural alternative in sebum-regulation field. ReferencesDe Souza Franco, E., De Aquino, C. M.
