Macedonia* marijakarapandzova@yahoo.comIntroductionPines are among the most important and widespread forest trees as they occur in a different range of environ-mental and climate conditions (Naydenov et al., 2006). Pinus nigra Arnold or black pine is a moderately variable species which grows widely throughout Mediterranean and is attributed to Balkan Peninsula as well as Republic of Macedonia where this conifer could be found on several localities (Karadzica, Kozuf, Shara Mountain etc. ).Essential oils isolated from different pine species are widely used as fragrances in cosmetic industry, as fla-voring additives for food and beverages and as scenting agents in a variety of household products and intermediates in the synthesis of perfume chemicals (Sezik et al., 2010). Since antiquity, they have been known to possess biologi-cal activity, most notably antibacterial, antifungal and an-tioxidant properties therefore are used in the ethno medi-cal practice and in the folk medicine throughout the world. Moreover, pine oils are used for medical purposes in aro-matherapy as carminative, rubefacient, emmenagogue and even as abortifacient agents. Additionally, the systematic and potential usefulness of essential oil studies has become increasingly important because of their growing interest in use in both the food and pharmaceutical industries (Kil-ic and Kocak, 2014). In this way, the chemistry and the bi-ological activity of the essential oils isolated from differ-ent pine species have been intensively studied, particularly needles essential oils. However, despite the abundant literature on this topic, there are no evident data about the chemistry and biolog-ical activity of Macedonian black pine, thus the main ob-jective of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oils isolated from needles and to access their antimicrobial activity against certain types of microorganisms in order to define possible application and therapeutic uses of these essential oils as antimicrobi-al agents.Materials and methodsPlant material (terminal branches) was collected from two different localities in R. Macedonia (Kozuf and Nidze) and was dried at room temperature, for two weeks. Just be-fore isolation, the needles were separated from the branch-es and were properly minced. Essential oil isolation was made by steam distillation in all-glass Clevenger apparatus (Ph.Eur. 8, 2.8.12.). For that purpose, 20 g of minced needles were distilled for 4 hours. For purification purpose, anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to the isolated essential oil to remove residu-al water. For GC/FID/MS analysis, the essential oil was dis-solved in xylene to obtain 1 ml/ml oil solution.Essential oil samples were analyzed on Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatography system equipped with FID detector and Agilent 5975C Mass Quadrupole detector according to previously published method by Karapandzova et al. (Karapandzova, 2014).Antimicrobial activity of essential oils was studied against 14 different microorganisms, including 13 bacterial isolates representing both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Strepto-coccus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococ-S5 PP 240504Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 503 - 504 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationscus pyogenes and Enterococcus) and Gram-negative bacte-ria (Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli ATCC 25927, Sal-monella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Haemophilus in-fluenzae and Proteus mirabilis) and one strain of Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Antimicrobial screening of all test-ed essential oils was made by disc diffusion and broth di-lution method previously described by Karapandzova et al. (2014).Results and discussionThe total needle essential oil content of Macedonian black pine calculated on anhydrous dried mass yielded from 8.03 to 8.34 ml/kg. Data analysis of the chemical composition of exam-ined essential oil samples revealed six different class-es of components: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenat-ed monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenat-ed sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and other non-terpene com-ponents. The most abundant fraction in the essential oil isolated from needles of Pinus nigra collected from Ko-zuf were monoterpene hydrocarbons (39.96%), while ses-quiterpenes were declared as dominant (46.45%) in the oil samples isolated from Pinus nigra from Nidze. This vari-ability in chemical composition of Macedonian black pines is probably due to the influence of environmental condi-tions on the biosynthesis of terpene compounds.Total of eighty nine components were identified in the investigated essential oil samples which represent-ed 87.63% of total oil. Predominant components were monoterpenes: a-pinene (29.23-30.51%), b-pinene (1.44-5.30%) and limonene + b-phellandrene (1.34-1.85%) and sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (8.56-11.38%), g-murrolene (0.98-2.11%) and germacrene D (17.32-21.21%).Previously established differences in the essential oil composition presumably affect their antimicrobial activity. In this regard, essential oil isolated from needles of black pine collected from Nidze has showed antimicrobial activ-ity towards Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae. Additionally, essential oil isolated from black pine needles from Kozuf revealed good antimicrobial ac-tivity against to another three microorganisms as they have showed strong antimicrobial effects toward Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for tested essential oil samples ranged from 15.25 to 62.25 ml/ml de-pending on the microorganism. According to literature data, essential oils isolated from needles of Macedonian black pine have showed the greatest similarity to the chemical composition of oils ob-tained from needles of black pines originating from Croatia and Greece with the exception of two components, 13-epi-manool oxide (2.25%) which was identified in the oil of Croatian black pine (Idzojtic et al., 2005) and 3-methyl-2-phenyl ester of butyric acid (2.10%) found in essential oils isolated from black pine from Greece (Roussis et al., 1994). Data concerning the antimicrobial activity of Pinus nigra essential oils indicated that there are no available published studies regarding this species. In terms of anti-microbial activity of the essential oils isolated from other pines, it is evident that it's in a direct correlation with the chemical composition and largely depends on the domi-nant components present in the oil.ConclusionMacedonian black pines contain essential oil with pre-dominant components a- and b-pinene and have showed good antimicrobial activity against selected Gram (+) bac-teria as well as Candida albicans. Nevertheless, further studies will be aimed in order to obtain more data about their antimicrobial potential as well as data about their safety usage until their final recommendation as antimicro-bial agents.ReferencesIdzojtic, M., Kajba, D., Franjic, J., 2005.

Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* ivanacvetkovikj@gmail.com, ivanacvetkovikj@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionJuniperus communis L. (Cupressaceae) (juniper) is coniferous evergreen tree or shrub, with needle-like leaves and berry-like cones, usually incorrectly consider as berry fruit. Actually, the plant grows as male and female plant and produce male and female cones, but only female cones are used as medicinal source for isolation of juniper oil (Juniperi aetherolem), valuable natural product for many purposes. The medicinal use of the juniper essential oil comprises: diuretic, antiseptic, digestive, stomachic and antireumathic activity, while commercial purposes include uses in food industry, in production of alcohol beverages, as well as, cosmetics and perfume production. The oil possesses specific chemical composition where as predominant components are considered the monoterpene hydrocarbons (a-pinene, b-pinene, b-myrcene, sabinene and limonene), followed by the fraction of oxygen-containing monoterepenes (EMA/HMPC/12401/2010), where terpinene-4-ol is considered to be responsible for the diuretic effect of the juniper oil (Chatzapoulou and Kastsiotis, 1993; Orav et al., 2010). The oil composition is highly variable, and depends on genetic and environmental factors (source, geographical origin, maturity of the berries, age of the plant, environmental factors) (Jo and Kim, 2005; Tasic et al., 1993). Furthermore, the differences in the essential oil chemical composition usually trigger variations in its activity. Over the years, the juniper berries and the juniper berry essential oil are natural drugs that are commercially exploited and exported from Republic of Macedonia (RM). Regarding this, the aim of the present work was determination of the chemical composition and possible chemical variability of the isolated juniper oils from wild growing plants in RM.Materials and methodsSamples of juniper berries were collected in late au-tumn in 2010, 2011 and 2012 from six regions in RM (North-West Mountain - Mtn. : Bistra Mtn., and Shara Mtn. ; Central Mtn. : Karadzica, Jakupica, and Dautica; Porechie: Kichevo, Makedonski Brod, and Samokov; Pelagonija re-gion: Bitola, Pelister, Prilep, and Resen; Black Drim re-gion: Debar, Karaorman, and Velestovo, and Maleshevija: Berovo). The collected plant material was air dried, stored at cool, and dark place, until analysis. The essential oils were isolated by steam-distillation in the Clevenger-type apparatus according to the method de-scribed in the Ph.Eur.8.0 (2014). The oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in vials in refrigera-tor until analysis.Essential oil samples were analyzed with Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatography system equipped with flame ionization detector (FID), and Agilent 5975C Mass Quad-ripole detector. For this purpose, an HP-5ms (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) capillary column was used. Operating conditions and identification of the components were previously published (Sela et al., 2011). Microsoft Excel(r) (Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA, USA) was used for obtained data tabulation, while multi-variate statistical analysis software SIMCA 14 (Unimetrics S5 PP 241506Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 505 - 506 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsAB, Sweden) was used for depth analysis. Values of p less than 0.05 were considered significant.Results and discussionWith GC/FID/MS, 93 components were determinate in the essential oil isolated from juniper berries from all geographic regions in RM. The juniper oil was composed mainly from monoterpene hydrocarbons: a-pinene (15.59-43.68%), b-myrcene (2.89-26.50%), sabinene (1.65-16.34%), and b-pinene (0.00-6.34%). The oxygen-containing monoterpene, terpinen-4-ol was presented from 0.02-4.35%. In addition, some sesquiterpene compounds were also important constituents of the oil and were present in larger percentages (germacrene D 1.25-12.89%; trans-E-caryophyllene 1.61-4.05% and a-humulene 1.61-4.60%). The analysed essential oils showed differences in the chemical composition. According literature data, differences and variability in the composition of juniper oil originated from different regions in Europe and America were already reported. a-Pinene was declared as main constituent present from 27.00% in the Greek samples, over 28.60-38.20% in samples from Montenegro, and up to 46.63% in the Iranian samples (Rezvani, 2010). Other important components such as sabinene, germacrene D, myrcene, b-pinene and limonene were found in different amounts."
