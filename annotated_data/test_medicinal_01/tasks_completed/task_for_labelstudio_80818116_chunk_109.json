The focus of the ADSI is on the hit-to-lead development, toxicology and \"mode of action\" studies in vitro. Focused libraries of natural or synthetic compounds are tested using an innovative high-content screening (HCS) approach that allows for the reliable identification of bioactive compounds or natural products. Development of screening modelsThe main goal is on the development and uses of in vitro assays where cultivated cells have similarly to the patient's tissue in vivo. These in vivo-like in vitro models are used for the high-content screening of focused libraries of natural or synthetic compounds. Automated microscopy, multiplexing readouts, metabolomics and proteomics allow the detection of molecules of interest, their changes during incubation with active substances and give a hint on the \"mode of action\" of particular substance in biological pathways. Primary cell co-culture systems in vitroThe use of human primary cell based culture systems provides for more predictable and clinically relevant results that facilitate new insights into the biology and cellular processes in the presence of tested compounds. Primary cells have much more delicate growth requirements and are often more sensitive to toxic agents than long-term cell lines. Synthetic and natural compounds are typically screened for toxicity with high-throughput assays that utilize tumor cell lines and simple endpoints like cell death or inhibition of cell proliferation. Although these methods have allowed the screening of huge numbers of compounds, many of the lead compounds screened by such practices have experienced late drug failure due to unacceptable toxicity in the clinic. In our hands, functional assays using primary cells from particular tissues deliver more predictive data on efficacy and actual toxic effects on the given tissues and organs than assays using cultured tumor cell lines. Toxicity tests developed in the ADSI enable early detection of potential side effects before the lead compounds reach pre-clinical tests in animal models. Following cell culture systems using human primary cells are available: mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), MSC derived adipocytes, MSC derived skeletal muscle myotubes, primary hepatocytes, monocytes and macrophages. Laboratory automationRobotics and automation are applied in an appropriate manner to achieve maximal information gain from a single experiment. Continuous monitoring with state-of-the art analytical and optical methods enables measurement of multiple cellular parameters modified by test substances including cell communication and transmission of signals. 3D cell culture The pharma and biotech industry recognizes the importance of moving from 2D cell culture towards 3D tissue culture platforms to increase the in vivo relevance S5 OP 215454Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 453 - 454 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsof in vitro-based assays for drug discovery. Synthetic hydrogels constitute the first choice to cultivate cells in a 3D environment when high levels of versatility, reproducibility and biological relevance are requested. Thanks to the possibility to engineer desired physical and biochemical properties, these hydrogels are capable of supporting the growth and differentiation of a wide range of cell types and tissue models in 3D. The Automated Screening Assay Platform was developed in order to automate cellular and tissue culture assays for 3D-cell-assay analyses in a time-resolved manner. 24/7 automation is achieved using robotic plate handling system, enabling users to schedule multiple runs of up to 40 cell culture plates in 96-well format. Metabolomics, secretomics and proteomicsThe analytical division focuses on the identification of compounds and pathways causing or mediating the biological activity in the cellular test systems. Advanced liquid chromatography separation techniques coupled to mass spectrometry provide the basis for analyses of test substances by means of metabolomics and proteomics approaches. Separation of samples is performed using analytical and preparative UPLC-systems either directly hyphenated to detection systems, sample spotters (MALDI-analysis) or fraction collectors. Mass spectrometry is used for the detection of small molecules by means of untargeted metabolomics in supernatants of cell co cultures, as well as in context of secretomics (proteins in cell supernatants) and or proteomics (proteins in cell lysates). Data mining and detailed analysis of acquired data facilitate the identification of compounds and pathways causing or mediating the biological activity in the cellular test systems. Biostatistics & bioinformatics All described biological and analytical methods produce huge amounts of raw data that have to be analysed properly. Acquired raw data from all systems are stored in the databank for further analyses. Biological and analytical data are processed using sophisticated biostatistics & bioinformatics tools and are then combined into comprehensive data sets providing reliable basis for the selection of drug candidates for later stages of drug development. Extraction & fractionation ADSI developed an expertise in the systematic variation of extraction procedures that allows for the development of pharmacologically active substance mixtures, such as plant extracts, that are optimized for their content of pharmacologically active ingredients. The fractionation of the samples using chromatographic techniques allows the rapid isolation of molecules of interest and the elucidation without dilation of their chemical structure. Special extraction procedures and chemical analytics allow optimization of the pharmacologically active substance mixtures in plant extracts. Further tailor-made assays and analyses are under development according to the demands of customers.ReferencesADSI - Austrian Drug Screening Institute Ltd, 2016. http://www.adsi.ac.at/en/analytics/phytoneering/ (accessed on 22.03.2016).Oral presentationsMacedonian pharmaceutical bulletin, 62 (suppl) 455 - 456 (2016)ISSN 1409 - 8695UDC: 615.322.074:543.51Short communicationThe application of mass spectrometry and pathway analysis in understanding the biochemistry of medicinal plantsShaun Bilsborough1* and Zoran Nastov2 1Agilent Technologies, Cheadle Royal Business Park, Stockport, SK8 3GR, United Kingdom 2Farmahem, Kicevska 1, 1060, Skopje, R. Macedonia* shaun_bilsborough@agilent.comIntroductionMass spectrometry profiling is used to determine the changes occurring in a biological system in response to dif-ferent conditions in order to better understand aberrations in the biochemical pathways involved (Rojo et al., 2012). The same methodology can be applied to the understand-ing of the biochemistry of plants that show medicinal prop-erties (Avula et al., 2014). When the investigation focuss-es upon the small molecule level, then different methods, mass spectrometry platforms and analytical conditions are required due to the various chemical properties of the com-pounds of interest, leading to numerous data files for each biological replicate. More recently, the application of hy-phenated techniques such as ion mobility have led to bet-ter separation of complex biological samples while the ad-ditional dimension has added another level of complexity to the data generated (May et al., 2015). Once the identi-ty of metabolites of interest has been determined, a critical requirement for the understanding of the biochemistry is the ability to map results directly to biochemical pathways (Bhat et al., 2014). In this presentation, an overview of the analytical and software requirements will be discussed to-gether with the application of biochemical pathway anal-ysis in the interpretation of complex data sets, which can lead to a better understanding of the biology of medicinal plants.Material and methodsCompounds were extracted through maceration of plant material in 50% (v/v) methanol:water. Samples were then filtered to remove the plant material and the extract-ed compounds separated directly into a 6550 quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer using a 1290 ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent Tech-nologies). The compounds were ionized by both electro-spray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and spectra acquired in both positive and negative ionization mode. An Eclipse Plus C18 column (2.1 mm x 150 mm; 1.8 um) was used for the separation with a lin-ear gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water against 0.1% for-mic acid in acetonitrile starting from 2% to 98% over 20 minutes at a flow rate of 250 mL/min. The resulting data was initially extracted using MassHunter ProFinder using batch recursive feature extraction and comparative analy-sis then performed using MassProfiler Professional. Sig-nificant, reproducible changes detected were identified us-ing the METLIN PCDL. The results were then visualized by mapping onto biochemical pathways using MassHunt-er Pathway Analysis.Results and discussionA comprehensive approach to LC/MS analysis using ESI and APCI ionization and both positive and negative ac-quisition together with cross-platform investigations, such as GC/MS, significantly increased coverage of the metab-olome. The addition of ion mobility separation further in-creased coverage through an orthogonal separation method based upon collision cross section of each compound. How-ever, this approach also produced a high volume of data and complexity to the investigation. Initial recursive batch ex-traction of the data files allowed significant data reduction while also improving the quality of the data that was then used for biological profiling. The extracted features were initially aligned and normalized followed by hierarchical clustering to check the reproducibility of biological repli-cates. Significant and reproducible differences between test S5 OP 216456Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 455 - 456 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsgroups were determined by analysis of variance, principal component analysis and fold-change filtering. The result-ing features were identified and annotated onto biochemical pathways to aid visualization. This was facilitated by the METLIN database of metabolites (Scripps Institute) local-ly installed on the instrument computer, which also allowed smaller subset databases to be generated based on the me-tabolites involved in biochemical pathways of interest. This provided an advantage in allowing such subset databases to be used for targeted data extraction of the metabolites in-volved in the pathways. These metabolites belonged to en-ergy, fatty acid, amino acid, nucleotide, and secondary met-abolic pathways. Multi-omic correlation analysis between genomic and metabolomics technologies allowed the iden-tification of co-regulated entities, such as genes and me-tabolites involved with amino acid, carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. Such a multi-omic approach provided ad-ditional evidence of important pathways and increased un-derstanding of specific pathways in the production of com-pounds of medicinal relevance.ConclusionLC/MS provides a reproducible, accurate method of analyzing complex samples to determine the compounds present. The challenge is in the interpretation of the high volume of complex data generated. Recursive batch ex-traction, biological profiling and pathway analysis allowed the data generated to be converted to knowledge in the form of identified metabolites, but more importantly, that knowledge could then be utilized to provide understanding of the important underlying biochemical pathways through pathway analysis.ReferencesAvula, B., Cohen, P.A., Wang, Y.H., Sagi, S., Feng, W., Wang, M., Zweigenbaum, J., Shuangcheng, M., Khan, I.A., 2014.

Macedonia: present situationGjoshe Stefkov*, Ivana Cvetkovikj, Marija Karapandzova, Svetlana KulevanovaInstitute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University \"Ss Cyril and Methodius\", Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* gstefkov@yahoo.comIntroductionCannabis or hemp (fam. Cannabinaceae) has three main types: C. sativa, C. indica, and C. ruderalis. It is a matter of divided opinion whether the genus consists of one or more species. Cannabis plants contain at least 489 distinct compounds distributed among 18 different chem-ical classes including cannabinoids, nitrogenous com-pounds, amino acids, proteins, enzymes, glycoproteins, hydrocarbons, simple alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and acids, fatty acids, simple esters and lactones, steroids, terpenes, non-cannabinoid phenols, flavonoids, vitamins, and pigments (Hillig and Mahlberg, 2004).Nowadays, the pharmacologically active substance in cannabis - cannabinoids, comprises more than 70 differ-ent phytocannabinoids, with potentially significant appli-cations in medicine and pharmacy. The principal cannabi-noids appear to be delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (i.e. 9-THC, THC), cannabinol (CBN), and cannabidiol (CBD). Other cannabinoids found in cannabis are cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and many others.Therapeutic properties of cannabis have been known since ancient times and have been a source of fiber, food, oil, medicine, and inebriant substances. There are signif-icant health benefits associated with the consumption of seeds and its derivatives, due to its well-balanced fatty acid spectrum and high value proteins. The therapeutic appli-cations of cannabis and its derivatives have been studied by various world bodies, including the Scientific Commit-tee of the House of Lords in Great Britain (1998), the Insti-tute of Medicine in the United States (1999) and the Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs in Canada (Abramov-ici, 2013). In order to assess the current knowledge on the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, a meta-analysis has been performed through Medline and PubMed up to July 1, 2005. Seventy-two controlled studies evaluating the ther-apeutic effects of cannabinoids were identified. Research studies have clearly shown that cannabinoids are highly ef-ficient, primarily in the treatment of nausea and vomiting and the management of chronic pain. For patients who suf-fer from severe, chronic diseases, such as cancer and AIDS, cannabis has been shown to relieve several symptoms at the same time in more efficient way than some registered medicines. Besides, there is a great potential of cannabi-noids to be applied for the treatment of many other path-ological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheim-er's disease, spinal cord injuries, Tourette's syndrome, ep-ilepsy, hypertension, glaucoma, although it is necessary to complete the last phases of clinical trials in order to regis-ter these compounds as drugs, and to assure safe therapy for these diseases (Ben Amar, 2006).Cannabis is a well-known drug and a controlled sub-stance, which possession and use are illegal in most coun-tries of the world. Nowadays, the use of cannabis and its le-galization for medical use has become a worldwide trend. Laws and attitudes toward cannabis are changing these days. Legalization of cannabis use for medical purposes is a hot topic at the global level and in most countries there have been initiatives to amend the existing laws in order to make drugs based on natural ingredients of cannabis, as well as other related products, synthetically produced, available to patients (Sarmento et al., 2015).Therefore, due to the increased global necessity of re-search on the cannabis and for the sake of reinforcing the ability of the R. Macedonia to respond to the challenges arising from this issue, we have started a study for chem-ical characterization of various cannabis products, mainly cannabis oil, as well as plant material from indigenous and foreign origin.S5 OP 217458Maced. pharm."
