Also this work would attempt to resolve two major problems: evaluation of the causes and the types of reports. At the same time it would present data gathered from conducted studies the aim of which was to estimate the appearance of adverse effects from the use of a cosmetic product, utilizing different methods for their detection, monitoring and prevention, as well as establishing a standard cosmetovigilance system.Causality assessmentThe definition of causality assessment is slightly different for French Health Products Safety Agency (AFSSAPS) and European Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery association (Colipa). For AFSSAPS, causality \"assesses the cause and effect relationship between a cosmetic product and a specific clinical and/or paraclinical manifestation\" (2010). Causality must be established for each product individually. For Colipa \"Causality assessment is particularly useful when the same product is involved in the occurrence of several cases of undesirable effects, when it makes it possible to determine the extent of a link of cause and effect between the cosmetic product and the undesirable effects observed and then to take these effects into account in the subsequent drawing-up of corrective measures such as investigations, recommendations on the proper use of the product, or regulations at national or European level (restrictions on use, warnings on packaging labels, limited concentration or prohibition) (Zweers et al., 2012).Several methods have been published. They are based on the analysis of evolving chronological and semiological elements. The results of relevant tests or of re-challenge tests can alter causality, for instance as regards contact allergy; appropriate patch testing provides a certain degree of causality. The AFSSAPS method is based on 6 criteria, divided into two groups, which are used to calculate a chronological score and a semiological score. The level of causality is determined using a decision table in which the scores are combined. The method has five levels of causality assessment: very likely, likely, not clearly attributable, unlikely and excluded. The causality assessment method by Colipa is based on three major criteria: symptomatology, chronology and results of specific tests. This method offers 3 levels of causality on the basis of a decision tree in which these criteria are combined: questionable, likely and very likely. Another method uses a flow chart as soon as the case has been reported, following a PLM (product lifecycle management) call approach. It is also based on chronological and semiological criteria and all the notifications can be analysed using 6 levels: irrelevant, not enough information, unlikely, possible, probable and certain. (The SCCPS notes of guidance for the testing of cosmetic ingredients and their safety evaluation, 2006).The cosmetovigilance system is the right means of obtaining information on the safety of cosmetic products and their ingredients. It can be used by the competent authorities in Europe, which would confirm that the new directives ensure a high level of safety. Cosmetovigilance makes it possible to exclude and control potentially hazardous ingredients which are included in the product content, and thus develops the costumers' trust and reassures them about the safety of the products available on the market.ReferencesEvaluation of the Cosmetics and Explosives Directives, Final Report (Cosmetics), 2007.

GDP regulates the division and movement of pharmaceuti-cal products from the premises of the manufacturer of me-dicinal products, or another central point, to the end user thereof, or to an intermediate point by means of various transport methods, via various storage and/or health estab-lishments.The wholesale distribution of medicinal products is an important activity in integrated supply chain management. Today's distribution network for medicinal products is in-creasingly complex and involves a lot of people from dif-ferent professional profiles. The GDP Guidelines establish appropriate tools to as-sist wholesale distributors in conducting their activities and to prevent falsified medicines from entering the le-gal supply chain. Compliance with these Guidelines will ensure control of the distribution chain and consequently maintain the quality and the integrity of medicinal prod-ucts (GGDP, 2103).The GDP Guidelines are intended to be applicable to all persons and outlets involved in any aspect of the stor-age and distribution of medicines from the premises of the manufacturer of the product to the person dispensing or providing medicines directly to a patient or his/her agent. This includes all parties involved in trade and distribution of medicines, including the manufacturers of bulk, finished products, wholesalers, as well as others such as suppliers, distributors, Government institutions, international pro-curement organization, logistic providers, traders, trans-port companies and forwarding agents and their employees as well as health workers. The main parts of GDP are: 1) Organization and management; 2) Quality management; 3) Personnel; 4) Equipment and premises; 5) Documentation; 6) Operations; 7) Outsourced activities; 8) Self inspections and 9) Transportation. In fact, the parts mentioned above form the GDP network. They interfere between each oth-er forming a complex system in order to provide quality assurance that ensures that the quality of pharmaceutical products is maintained through adequate control through-out the numerous activities which occur during the distri-bution process. Every part of the GDP system is important to maintain the quality of the distribution chain. Regarding Organization and management, an adequate organizational structure for each entity in the chain of distribution should be defined with the aid of an organizational chart. The aim of this organizational chart is to have a clear view of the duties and responsibilities of each person involved in the process (GGDP, 2103; WHO, GDP, 2005).Every individual involved in the process of distribu-tion should have a written job description and at every lev-el of the supply chain, employees should be fully informed and trained in their duties and responsibilities.Training should be based on written standard operat-ing procedures (SOPs). Personnel should receive initial and continuing training relevant to their tasks, and be as-sessed as applicable, in accordance with a written training program.The system for managing quality should encompass the organisational structure, procedures, processes and re-sources, as well as activities necessary to ensure confidence that the product delivered maintains its quality and integri-ty and remains within the legal supply chain during storage and/or transportation. The quality system should be ful-ly documented and its effectiveness monitored. All qual-ity-system-related activities should be defined and docu-mented. A quality manual or equivalent documentation ap-proach should be established. A responsible person should S4 PP 213448Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 447 - 448 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsbe appointed by the management, who should have clear-ly specified authority and responsibility for ensuring that a quality system is implemented and maintained.This responsible person is designated by the whole-sale distributor and should meet the qualifications and all conditions provided for by the legislation of the Member State concerned. A degree in pharmacy is desirable. The re-sponsible person should have appropriate competence and experience as well as knowledge of and training in GDP (GGDP, 2103; GGDPBP, 2012).Besides the responsible person there should be an ade-quate number of competent personnel involved in all stag-es of the wholesale distribution activities of medicinal products. The number of personnel required will depend on the volume and scope of activities. Wholesale distributors must have suitable and ade-quate premises, installations and equipment, so as to en-sure proper storage and distribution of medicinal products. In particular, the premises should be clean, dry and main-tained within acceptable temperature limits.Different medicines require different storage condi-tions. There are medicines that should be stored following the cold chain regime and medicines that should be stored on room temperature, 2-8 degC and 15 -25 degC respectively (Com-mission Directive 2003/94/EC, 2003; WHO, GDP, 2005).Equipment and processes should be respectively quali-fied and/or validated before commencing use and after any significant changes, e.g. repair or maintenance.There are a lot of SOPs (standard operative proce-dures) that determine every step of the processes that are conducted during the reception, storage and dispatch of the medicines.All actions taken by wholesale distributors should en-sure that the identity of the medicinal product is not lost and that the wholesale distribution of medicinal products is performed according to the information on the outer packaging. The wholesale distributor should use all means available to minimise the risk of falsified medicinal prod-ucts entering the legal supply chain.Also in compliance with the GDP standard qualifica-tion of the supplier and costumers must be done.Regarding the situations that can occur after the pa-tient has received the medicines, there must also be a SOP on how to handle a complaint from the costumer as well as a SOP for medicines that are returned for some reason.In order to provide a continuous quality management system, self-inspections must be conducted in an impartial and detailed way by designated competent company per-sonnel. Audits by independent external experts may also be useful but may not be used as a substitute for self-in-spection.The transportation of the medicines is a very impor-tant part of the distribution process, that is why the person-nel in charge of transportation must be trained how to op-erate with the medicines that should be distributed and the vehicles involved in the process must be suitably calibrat-ed and mapped as well.Considering all the facts mentioned above a con-clusion can be made that the Good Distribution Practice (GDP) system is a very important tool in order to provide a better medicine quality regarding distribution factors and an improved health care system as well, which will con-tribute for a higher safety of the patients (Commission Di-rective 2003/94/EC, 2003; GGDP, 2103).ReferencesGGDP, 2103.

The principal identification strat-egies are based on macro- and microscopic analysis, com-plemented by phytochemical methods. The methods are defined in national and supranational pharmacopoeias. Be-sides these methods, identification by DNA sequences is in fast development and supplements classical methods in difficult matrices like e.g. powdered roots or even extracts (Novak et al., 2007). The DNA-sequence as tool to identify speciesThe sequence of the nucleotides in the DNA ('DNA sequence') is unique for each individual. However, re-lated individuals share their DNA sequence to a big ex-tent and the closer the relationship the higher the degree of sequence consensus. With a well-defined set of refer-ence samples, mutations in short DNA pieces can be iden-tified that are variable between taxa (e.g. species) but sta-ble within the taxon. Based on these informative muta-tions, unknown samples can be assigned to a specific tax-on (Kress et al., 2005). Right now, it is not possible to eval-uate and compare the whole genome of each sample with each other in cheap and fast routine analysis. Therefore, routine methods are developed based on small informative sequence parts, which are mostly in the size range of a few hundred base pairs.Since molecular biology has very wide application area from biology to medicine and forensics the develop-ment of new technologies is very fast. Therefore, also pos-sible molecular biological methods for identifying medic-inal plants and biological contaminations in plant material are numerous as exemplarily listed below: * Hybridization-based methods (examples: dynam-ic allele-specific hybridization, molecular bea-cons, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mi-croarrays)* Enzyme-based methods (examples: restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), PCR-based methods (e.g. amplification refractory mu-tation system (ARMS))* Post-PCR methods based on physical properties of the DNA (examples: Single strand conforma-tion polymorphism, denaturing HPLC, high-reso-lution melting of the entire amplicon (HRM), use of DNA mismatch-binding proteins, SNPlex)This presentation will focus on a few methodological examples, namely DNA sequencing, ARMS and HRM. 'Classical' DNA sequencing (Sanger sequencing)The 'classical' DNA sequencing delivers complete sequence information of short DNA pieces (amplicons). Comparing a sample sequence with the reference sequenc-es (e.g. with phylogenetic methods), the sample can be identified (Kress et al., 2005). However, the classical as-sessment by DNA sequencing is still time-consuming and relatively expensive, a fact that can be overcome by oth-er DNA-based methods better suitable for routine analysis. Amplification-Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)One method is the ARMS in which alternative PCR primers are developed in a way to bind only to the infor-mative mutation (Little, 2001). Therefore, a PCR-product is only obtained if the primer fits to the desired mutation. S5 OP 214452Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 451 - 452 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsIn gel electrophoresis following PCR, the presence or ab-sence of the PCR product can be detected. This method was used to identify Valeriana officinalis increasing rou-tine efficiency by combining several PCR reactions in one tube (Ruzicka et al., 2016).High-Resolution-Melting-Analysis (HRMA)Another method is HRMA. The principle of this meth-od is the separation of the two DNA-strands ('melting' of the DNA) by slowly increasing the temperature at high-ly constant rates ('high-resolution'). The 'melting' can be measured by the decreasing intensity of a fluorescence dye intercalating the DNA resulting in a melting curve that is specific for a DNA sequence (Ruzicka et al., 2016). The el-egance of this method besides its reliability in measure-ment is that the fluorescence measurement takes place im-mediately after PCR in the same machine and in the same tube as the PCR reaction. Sample manipulation is therefore limited to a minimum, which makes this method especially attractive for routine analysis (Schmiderer et al., 2010, Ru-zicka et al., 2016). Another aspect of medicinal plant qual-ity control is adulteration. HRM can be also used to de-tect adulterations in complex mixtures (Mader et al., 2011, Schmiderer et al., 2015).ConclusionIn the last years, many different methods to identi-fy medicinal plants using different technology were de-veloped and their stability and efficiency proofed. There-fore, the way is open to consider them for their inclusion in pharmacopoeias as official testing methods in order to sup-plement classical identification methods in difficult species or matrices.ReferencesKress, W.J., Wurdack, K.J., Zimmer, E.A., Weigt, L.A., Janzen, D.H., 2005.
