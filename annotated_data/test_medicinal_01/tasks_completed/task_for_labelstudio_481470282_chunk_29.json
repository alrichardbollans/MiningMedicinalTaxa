Both are of high economic importance since they are used in a variety of products from foods to cosmetics, perfumery and aromatherapy. The genus Lavandula includes 22 species grown in countries around the Mediterranean. Among them L. angustifolia commercially known as English lavender, is widely exploited with cultivations of local varieties and artificial hybrids. It has been used for centuries as a therapeutic agent and its essential oils became very popular after the 1st World War, then used as antimicrobial and later as an ingredient in perfumery and cosmetics. Melissa officinalis grows wild in the northern part of the Mediterranean basin. Three morphologically and chemically distinct subspecies are recognized. Subsp. officinalis plants are commercially exploited almost all over Europe, under the vernacular name lemon balm. In Greece it is found in the wild but mainly in small scale cultivations. With the common names \"melissa\" and \"melissobotano\", it is used in traditional foods and herbal teas. Twelve essential oils from L. angustifolia cultivated in Greece were tested for their: (i) antioxidant activity in two different in vitro assays presenting significant antioxidant profile (38-71%), and (ii) inhibitory activity against lipoxygenase (42-63%) and acetyl-cholinesterase (17-51%). M.officinalis subsp. officinalis leaves from hydroponic crop plants were tested in vitro as antioxidants and were found to possess high activity in both assays (71-84% and 66-83%). The anti-lipoxygenase and anti-acetylcholinesterase activities were low (23-29% and 26%) compared to standard reference compounds. The present results on the biological activity of the two examined species are very promising.Acknowledgement: This research has been co-financed by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational Program Competitiveness, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, under the call RESEARCH - CREATE - INNOVATE (project code: T1EDK-04174).www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 22320th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP111. Protective effect of Chios Mastic Gum on bone mineral density of ovariectomized rats.A.E. Pepe1, P. Lelovas1, V.K. Pachi2, A.L. Skaltsounis2, S. Mitakou2, A. Galanos1, I. Dontas11 Laboratory for Research of the Musculoskeletal System, School of Medicine, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, KAT Hospital, Greece2 Department of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, GreeceThe aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effect of Chios Mastic Gum (CMG) [Pistacia lentiscus var. chia] on bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar vertebra of ovariectomised rats, a site used for BMD measurement in humans. Thirty 10-month-old Wistar rats were randomly allocated into three groups of ten, Control, Ovariectomy and Ovariectomy-plus-CMG in their food. The BMD of the sixth lumbar vertebra was evaluated in all groups before ovariectomy (baseline) and after 3 and 6 months post ovariectomy. For the characterization of CMG, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) and High Resolution Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (HRMS/MS) were used. The results showed that both acidic and neutral triterpenoids were identified while special attention was given to the characteristic triterpenic acids of CMG e.g. masticadienonic, isomasticadienonic, moronic, oleanonic acids. Comparison of the absolute values of the sixth lumbar vertebra BMD revealed no statistical difference between groups at baseline. At three months, the BMD of the Ovariectomy-plus-CMG group was significantly higher than the BMD of the Ovariectomy group (p=0.001), while there was no statistical significant difference with the Control group (p=1.000). At six months, the BMD of the Ovariectomy-plus-CMG group was significantly higher than the BMD of the Ovariectomy group (p=0.010), with no statistical significant difference versus the Control group (p=0.599). In conclusion, according to the results of the present study, the administration of CMG with the above-mentioned triterpenoids and acids exerted a significant beneficial impact on the BMD of the sixth lumbar vertebra.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org22420th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP112. Chemical analyzes of Matricaria pubescens and Matricaria recutita polar extracts and study of their anti-inflammatory properties.M.E. Ignatiadou1, S. Zoumpou1, Z. Kabouche2, P. Chatzopoulou3, M. Kostaki4, M. Rallis4, A. Karioti11 Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece2 Laboratoire d'Obtention de Substances Therapeutiques (L.O.S.T), Universite des freres Mentouri-Constantine, Algeria3 Hellenic Agricultural Organization Demeter | ELGO, Institute of Breeding and Plant Genetic Resources, Thessaloniki, Greece4 Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmacy, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, GreeceMatricaria pubescens (Desf.) Schultz (Asteraceae), known as hairy chamomile, is endemic in North Africa and is used in rheumatic and muscular pains, coughs, allergies, ocular affections, dysmenorrhea, scorpion stings, dehydration and toothaches [1]. In Europe M. recutita L is the officially recognized species used for mild gastrointestinal problems, ulcers and inflammations of mouth and throat, for irritated skin and mucosae and for the relief of common cold [2]. As a part of a project aiming at studying Matricaria sp. the analysis of M. pubescens from Algeria and M. recutita from Greece was undertaken. Methanolic and hydroalcoholic extracts were prepared and studied by HPLC-PDA-MS and NMR. In M. pubescens more than 20 compounds have been identified up to now, among them quercetagenin-3-O-glucopyranoside, reported for the first time in Matricaria sp. and two polyamines previously reported in other Asteraceae sp. [3]. Fingerprint analysis and comparison of this species to the officially recognized in Europe M. recutita L. shows many similarities in the chemical content and justifies the ethnopharmacological uses in Algerian traditional medicine. M. recutita extracts from Greece were also characterized by HPLC-PDA-MS and were rich in phenolic constituents. Structure elucidation was carried out by HPLC-PDA-MS by use of reference standards, by classical phytochemical analyzes followed by 1D and 2D NMR and by combination of NMR and HPLC-PDA-MS on sub-fractions. The characterized extracts were screened for their protective effects on 3T3 fibroblasts. The cells were exposed to UVA light to 5-7J/cm2 in presence of different doses of the extracts. Cell viability and oxidative stress were evaluated by neutral red absorption (540nm) and 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester fluorescence (excitation at 485 and emission at 520nm). M. recutita methanolic extract had the best protective effect in mild inflammation (60 minutes) The best extract will be further tested in vivo, on hairless mouse skin, as topical anti-inflammatory agent.

Sreckovic2, J.S. Katanic Stankovic3, V. Mihailovic2, D.M. Lazari11 Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece2 Faculty of Science, Department of Chemistry, University of Kragujevac, Serbia3 Institute for Information Technologies Kragujevac, Department of Science, University of Kragujevac, SerbiaAchillea species are known for their healing properties since ancient times. There is extensive literature on their pharmacological action due to their bioactive compounds. The present study aimed to investigate the antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of hydroalcoholic extracts from the inflorescences and leaves of the species Achillea crithmifolia Waldst. & Kit., A. grandifolia Friv. and A. millefolium L. The phytochemical profile of all extracts was monitored using NMR spectroscopy and applying techniques for evaluation of total phenolic (TP) and total flavonoid (TF) contents which are in accordance with the results estimated using the Folin-Ciocalteu method (TP:125.42-191.98mg/g, TF:47.34-180.02mg/g of extracts). All extracts were tested for their antioxidant activity using two in vitro methods, DPPH and ABTS *+ radical scavenging assay. All extracts showed good to moderate antioxidant activity, compared to the reference substance BHT. Moreover, the antibacterial activity was tested against some of the major food-borne pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). None of extracts showed satisfactory antimicrobial activity.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org22620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP114. Natural products isolated from Thymus thracicus Velen. (Lamiaceae) exert strong antiplatelet action.G.D. Geromichalos1, E.G. Vartholomatos2,3, T.K. Papagrigoriou2, G.S. Markopoulos4, D.M. Lazari21 Department of General and Inorganic Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece2 Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Department of Pharmacognosy-Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece3 Hematology Laboratory, Unit of Molecular Biology, University Hospital of Ioannina, Greece4 Laboratory of Biology, School of Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ioannina, GreeceToday, the need for antiplatelet therapy with similar biological effects of aspirin without its drawbacks, is the objective of major pharmaceutical companies. Aim of this study was to investigate antiplatelet effects of oresbiusin A (1) and methyl ester of rosmarinic acid (2), isolated from the methanolic extract of Thymus thracicus, compared to aspirin in whole blood. Experiments for antiplatelet action were performed on whole blood from healthy donors who have not taken medication for more than 20 days. Platelet activation in the presence of compounds (1) or (2) vs. aspirin was analyzed by flow cytometry, quantifying CD61PerCP, CD62-P PE and CD41aFITC, present in activated platelets. Welding experiments were performed in Multiplate assay with coagulant factors ADP, Collagen and arachidonic acid. Microparticle quantification was done with flow cytometry. The IC50 values calculated for different agonists (ADP, Collagen and arachidonic acid) by flow cytometry, using the expression of CD62-P were 1.6-3.5mM for (1), 0.75-2.45mM for (2), significantly lower than the respective ones of ASP (2.5-5.03mM). Multiplate assay confirmed antiplatelet action of (1) and (2) in all the conditions used. We analyzed the presence of microparticles after activation of platelets with ADP, which, in the presence of substances (1) and (2) showed a striking reduction. In order to explore their ability to act as antiplatelet drugs, and to explain their described in vitro activity, we adopted in silico molecular docking studies. The computational approach revealed that both constituents possess antiplatelet activity inhibiting the proteins cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), human protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12R), P-Selectin (CD62P), transcription nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and protein kinase C alpha (PKCa), all involved in platelet aggregation. Furthermore, we explored the binding capacity of both compounds to Human Serum Albumin, as a drug transport mechanism. Based on our results we conclude that both compounds exert strong antiplatelet action combined with reduction of microparticle formation.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 22720th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP115. Investigation of the anti-inflammatory potential of the Himalayan ethno-medicinal plant Sauromatum venosum.M. Khalil-ur-Rehman, X.H. Nost, E.M. Pferschy Wenzig, R. BauerInstitute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Graz, AustriaWestern Himalaya hosts a diverse flora comprising of many ethno-medicinally important plants. Most of the plants have not been investigated for scientific evidence of the medical claims set by the local ethnic communities [1]. One of these Himalayan plants is Sauromatum venosum (Dryand. ex Aiton) Kunth (Araceae). Plants from this family are known to be used for the treatment of pain and inflammation. The local residents have also reported S. venosum for the treatment of cancerous diseases [2]. Since inflammation is linked with the development and progression of various cancers [3], the anti-inflammatory effects of this plant were investigated by using cyclooxygenase inhibition assays with COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Plant tubers collected from Kotli Azad Kashmir (a district in Himalaya) were extracted, and dried tuber extracts were analysed by LC-MS and used for the in vitro testing. Both, COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition studies revealed that the plant extracts (at 20ug/ml) are exceptionally active against the COX-2 isoenzyme with a maximum inhibition by the dichloromethane extract of 77%, while this extract showed only 10% inhibition of COX-1. Other extracts (n-hexane, ethylacetate and methanol) showed COX-2 inhibition of 70%, 61%, and 75%, while these extracts showed COX-1 inhibition only of 6%, 9%, and 13%, respectively."
