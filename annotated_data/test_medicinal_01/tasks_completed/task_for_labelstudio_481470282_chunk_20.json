Moreover, the nutritional composition of dried mushroom has been determined, leading to the fact that G. lucidum contains a high percentage of unsaturated fatty acids and proteins. Evaluating the results, it can be suggested that the rich phytochemical profile, as well as the high antioxidant and nutritional value of G. lucidum could support the use of Greek Ganoderma as a good source in cosmetics and food supplements comparable with literature from cultivated and wild mushrooms from Asia.Bishop, K.

The sacred plants of Dionysus.Ch. Brakatselos, F. Delis, P. Lekkas, M.Z. Asprogerakas, K. Antoniou, M. MarselosDepartment of Pharmacology, Medical Faculty, School of Health Sciences, University of Ioannina, GreeceIn antique pottery pictures depicting the celebrations for Dionysus, apart from vine plants (Vitis vinifera) and flasks of wine, there are also ivy wreaths (Hedera helix) -including ivy berries- that adorned the heads of god and his worshipers, usually bacchae and satyrs. In addition, most figures hold long sticks, originating from the flowering stem of the plant giant fennel (Ferula communis), with a pine on top of them (Pinus sylvestris). Euripides, in the tragedy Bacchae, mentions smilax (Smilax aspera) as another plant of the decorative wreaths. Ivy and smilax are climbing evergreen shrubs, which have been considered as symbols of the power of Dionysus to revitalize nature every spring. Nevertheless, the furious rituals pertaining to these ceremonial orgies, with wild dances in the rhythm of drums and flutes, impose the question whether the faithful followers of Dionysus were using inebriating herbs together with wine. We have put ivy, smilax and giant fennel under bibliographical scrutiny, in order to trace any possible role in the formation of \"medicinal\" wines. Of these plants, only ivy seems to fulfill such criteria. In some preliminary experiments of our lab, a water extract of homogenized ivy berries was administered orally to rats, either alone or in combination with a single ethanol dose (2,5 mg/kg). The observed behavioral profile revealed that the animals were affected in terms of motor response, exploratory activity and anxiety state.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 16520th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP057. Chemical analysis of essential oil and phenolic compounds isolated from ethyl acetate extract of Drama's Propolis (Macedonia, Greece).O. St. Tsiftsoglou, M. Koromili, T. Papagrigoriou, S. Klinaki, D. LazariAristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, GreecePropolis has been used in folk medicine since ancient times. Nowadays, almost all bees products, such as honey and propolis, use as \"bio\"-cosmetics and as functional foods. Meanwhile, commercial interest to propolis is growing continuously. There is not a high concentration of volatile compounds in propolis, although their aroma and versatile biological activity and characteristic pleasant aroma make them important. Chemical composition of propolis depends on the local flora, geographic location and the site of collection. Hydrodistillation of propolis collected in Drama (2014) afforded yellowish essential oils. GC-MS analysis indicated that the predominant components of this essential oil were: g-cadinene (19.82%), a-eudesmol (12.03%), a-muurolene (9.25%), epi-a-muurolol (8.71%) and g-muurolene (8.48%). Moreover, a phytochemical study of the propoli's ethyl acetate extract led to the isolation of five known natural products: two flavonoids: chrysin (1) and pinobanksin (2) and three esters of caffeic acids: caffeic acid phenethyl ester (3), caffeic acid benzyl ester (4) and cinnamylcaffaete (5). The chemical structures of the isolated compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR analysis (1H, 13C, gDQCOSY, gHSQCAD, gHMBCAD), and through comparison with the literature.Acknowledgements: The authors are grateful to Mr. PantelisVasilas who provides us with the sample of propolis.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org16620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP058. Evaluation of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of Ranunculaceae plants and secondary metabolites from Adonis cyllenea.O.St. Tsiftsoglou1, S.V. Apostolopoulos2, D.I. Hajipavlou-Litina3, D.M. Lazari11 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Greece2 Wine-lab, Xylokastro, Greece3 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, GreeceSeveral of the plants belonging to the Ranunculaceae family have been mainly studied due to their toxicity. In this study, the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of extracts from different parts of Ranunculaceae's plants have been evaluated (in vitro): Adonis cyllenea Boiss. (aerial parts), Anemone coronaria L.(inflorescence), Caltha palustris L. (leaves and inflorescence), Consolida ajacis (L.) Schur (seeds) and Helleborus odorus Waldst. & Kit subsp. cyclophyllus (A. Braun) Maire & Petitm (aerial parts and roots).The polar extracts of the aerial parts of A. cyllenea were fractionated using solvents of increasing polarity and have been purified. So far, secondary metabolites which belong to tritrpenoids (fukujusone, digitoxigenin, strophanthidine and cymarine) and a polyol (adonitol) have been isolated, by using several chromatographic techniques (C.C. and HPLC) and have been identified by using spectroscopic methods (NMR and MS). This is the first research that concerns the phytochemical composition of this endemic Greek plant.Acknowledgements: The authors are grateful to: Dr. Nikos Krigas (Researcher in National Agricultural Research Foundation, Laboratory for the Conservation and Evaluation of Native and Floricultural Species, Thermi, Thessaloniki Greece) for the identification of the plant material and PhD candidate Elena Zioga for the collection of Caltha palustris L.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 16720th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP059. NMR-based metabolomic analysis of four Siederitis spp. (Lamiaceae) hydroalcoholic extracts and their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.D.A. Yfantidou1, O.St. Tsiftsoglou1, N. Krigas2, D.I. Hajipavlou-Litina3, D.M. Lazari11 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Greece 2 National Agricultural Research Foundation, Laboratory for the Conservation and Evaluation of Native and Floricultural Species, Thermi, Thessaloniki, Greece3 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, GreecePerennial Sideritis species have been widely used in traditional medicine since ancient times for phytotherapy. This genus includes more than 150 species worldwide, among which 16 different species and subspecies are native to Greece (including 10 perennials and 5 local Greek endemics) [1]. Sideritis spp. are of great interest due to their pharmacological properties, such as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity [3]. According to previous phytochemical studies, Sideritis spp. are rich in secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, iridoids, phenylethanoid glucosides and diterpenes [2,3]. In this study, we collected the aerial parts of four species and/or subspecies from different areas of Greece: Sideritis euboea, S. clandestina subsp. peloponnesiaca and S. raeseri subsp. attica (local Greek endemics) and S. scardica (near threatened local Balkan endemic). The phytochemical profile of hydroalcoholic extracts was monitored using NMR spectroscopy. According to the spectra obtained, the main compounds of the examined extracts were phenolics (flavonoids and phenylethanoid glucoside). All the extracts were also tested for their biological activity using three in vitro techniques: the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (AAPH), testing both the antioxidant activity, and the inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX), testing the anti-inflammatory activity. All the extracts showed strong antioxidant activity (>74.8%) with the DPPH method, compared to the reference substance NDGA. Moreover, there was not observed a reduction on the levels through the 60 min of this method. The extracts with the lipid peroxidation method and the inhibition of lipoxygenase showed no or low activity. [1] Dimopoulos et al. Englerra 31, 2013; Willdenowia, 2016, 46(3), 301-347. [2] F.

Rapid separation of manoyl oxide and 13-epi-manoyl oxide from Cistus creticus leaves and their seasonal variability Tsikalas, K. G., Stefanakis, K. M., Kate inopoulos, E. H. Department f Chemistry, Division of Organic Chemistry, University of Crete, Heraklion-Voutes 71003, Crete, Greece. e-mail: gtsikalas@uoc.gr 13-epi-Manoyl oxide (1) and Manoyl oxide (2) are high value diterpenoids with a broad range of pharmaceutical applications. They are naturally found in many plants. Because of their complex molecular structure, (1) and (2) are not commercially produced by chemical synthesis. In this study we present a fast and efficient method of isolation of these two components. 13-epi-manoyl oxide (1) manoyl oxide (2) 13-epi-Manoyl oxide (1) and Manoyl oxide (2) are major components of the essential oil collected from Cistus creticus subsp. creticus (Viv.) Greuter & Burdet, (Cistaceae). Moreover, the essential oil from the plant's resin, known as \"Ladano\", which is collected by a traditional method, has a remarkable abundance of (1) and (2). Leave samples from Cistus creticus were collected monthly from February to July 2018. The dried leaves were hydrodistilled in a Clevenger apparatus. The first fraction of the essential oil, collected after one hour, contained most of the volatile ingredients. The distillation was continued for 24 hours to yield the rest of components. To our surprise, the essential oil of the February sample yielded (1) with purity above 99% and was completely void of (2) and any other volatile substances. The same procedure was followed for the samples of the following months, and a mixture containing only (1) and (2) was isolated. Over time, Manoyl oxide increased by up to 40% of the total mixture. Due to the structural similarity of the two molecules it was not possible to separate them by any of the common analytical techniques. Separation was finally achieved by column chromatography using a mixture of neutral alumina-silver nitrate as filler material. All compounds were identified by 1- and 2D NMR, GC/MS, and optical rotation measurements.
