As seen in Table 3, methanol, ethanol, aqueous oracidified methanol or ethanol are the most used extractionsolvents. The acidified solvents (usually with the addition of 0.5%of inorganic or organic acids) are used to combine with freebase organic alkaloids and transform them in alkaloid salts withhigher solubility (Teng and Choi, 2013). The effect of differentinorganic acids like hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, nitricacid, and sulfuric acid as well as the effect of an organic acidlike acetic acid were tested on berberine content and otheralkaloids in rhizomes of Coptis chinensis Franch by Teng andChoi (2013). In this case, 0.34% phosphoric acid concentrationwas considered optimal. Moreover, when compared to otherclassical extraction techniques like reflux and Soxhlet extraction,the cold acid assisted extraction gave 1.1 times higher berberineyields.Large solvent volumes and long extraction time representother drawbacks of conventional extraction methods (Mokgadiet al., 2013). For example, Rojsanga and Gritsanapan (2005)used maceration process to extract 100 g of C. fenestratumplant material with a total volume of 3,200mL solvent (80%ethanol) over a period of 416 h. Furthermore, in a differentstudy, Rojsanga et al. (2006) used several classical extractiontechniques likemaceration, percolation, and Soxhlet extraction toextract the berberine from C. fenestratum stems. This time evenif the extracted plant material was in a lower amount than theprevious study (30 vs. 100 g), large solvent volumes (2,000mLfor maceration, 5,000mL for percolation, and 600mL for Soxhletextraction) over long time periods (7 days for macerationand 72 h for Soxhlet extraction) were employed (Rojsanga andGritsanapan, 2005; Rojsanga et al., 2006).Large solvent volumes are characteristic for otherconventional methods too. Shigwan et al. (2013) extractedberberine from Berberis aristata and B. tinctoria powdered stembark (800 g) using hot extraction (50*C for 3 h) with 2,500mLmethanol (Shigwan et al., 2013).Even though conventional methods are widely used inberberine extraction, a number of other different methods havebeen developed lately. This led to an improved extractionefficiency, a decreased extraction time and solvents' volumes usedin the extraction. Thus, ultrasound assisted solvent extraction(USE), microwave-assisted solvent extraction (MAE), ultrahighpressure extraction (UPE), and supercritical fluid extractions(SFE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) have been successfullyused as alternative extraction techniques with better results whencompared with classical extraction methods.Ultrasonically and microwave-assisted extraction areconsidered green, simple, efficient, and inexpensive techniques(Alupului et al., 2009).Teng and Choi (2013) extracted berberine from Rhizomecoptidis by optimized USE. Using response surface methodology,they identified that the optimal extraction conditions were 59%ethanol concentration, at 66.22*C within 46.57min. A decreasein the extraction time (39.81min) was obtained by Chang (2013).He used the combination of ionic liquids solutions as greensolvents with USE to extract berberine from Coptis chinensis inorder to apply an environmentally friendly approach (Chang,2013). Moreover, in their study, Xu et al. (2017) comparedseveral extraction tehniques like USE, distillation, and Soxhletextraction in order to establish an high-efficient methodfor phellodendrine, berberine, and palmatine extraction fromfresh Phellodendron bark (Cortex phellodendri). In the case ofberberine, the combination of simple or acidified solvent (water,ethanol, andmethanol) with the adjustment of the specific settingcharacteristics to each extraction type enabled them to determinethe highest extraction yield. They concluded that the use ofUSE and hydrochloric acid-acidified methanol were the mostefficient in extracting berberine. The USE extraction yield wassignificantly higher when compared to distillation and Soxhletextraction, with values of ~100 mg/g toward 50 and 40 mg/gberberine, respectively (Xu et al., 2017).The important reduction in organic solvent and extractiontime determined the increasing interest in MAE, too. Lately,MAE was used as a green and cost-effective alternative toconventional methods. Using central composite design, Satijaet al. (2015) successfully optimized the MAE parameters in termsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55735Neag et al.

They compared two classicalextraction techniques like maceration and Soxhlet extractionwith MAE under optimized conditions (60% irradiation power,80% ethanol concentration, and 3min extraction time). Theresults showed that MAE extraction had the highest yieldof berberine content with 1.66% (w/w) while Soxhlet andmaceration had 1.04 and 0.28% (w/w), respectively. Their study isemphasizing the dramatic time reduction in case of MAE (3min)when compared with Soxhlet extraction (3 h) and maceration (7days) together with solvent and energy consumption (Satija et al.,2015).Another novel extraction technique considered to beenvironmentally friendly is UPE. The interest toward thisextraction technique is increasing because it presents severaladvantages toward classical extraction techniques like increasedextraction yields, higher quality of extracts, less extractiontime, and decreased solvent consumption (Xi, 2015). These areachieved at room temperature by applying different pressurelevels (from 100 to 600MPa) between the interior (higher values)and the exterior of cells (lower values) in order to facilitate thetransfer of the bioactive compounds through the plant matricesin the extraction solvent (Liu et al., 2006, 2013). In the studyregarding berberine content in Cortex phellodendri, Guopinget al. (2012) made a comparison between UPE, MAE, USE, andheat reflux extraction techniques. They observed that the higherextraction yield and the lower extraction time was obtained incase of UPE with 7.7 mg/g and 2min extraction time towardreflux, USE and MAE with 5.35 mg/g and 2 h, 5.61 mg/g and 1 h.and 6 mg/g and 15min, respectively (Guoping et al., 2012).Super critical fluid extraction is another environmentallyfriendly efficient technique used in phytochemical extraction.Because the extraction is performed in the absence of light andoxygen, the degradation of bioactive compounds is reduced. Also,the inert and non-toxic carbon dioxide used as a main extractionsolvent in combination with various modifiers (e.g., methanol)and surfactants (e.g., Tween 80) at lower temperatures andrelatively low pressure, allows the efficient extraction of bioactivecompounds (Liu et al., 2006; Farias-Campomanes et al., 2015). Incase of berberine extraction from the powdered rhizome ofCoptischinensis Franch, the highest recovery of berberine was obtainedwhen 1,2-propanediol was used as amodifier of supercritical CO2(Liu et al., 2006).Pressurized liquid extraction, also known as pressurizedfluid extraction, pressurized solvent extraction, and acceleratedsolvent extraction (ASE) is considered a green technology usedfor compounds extraction from plants (Mustafa and Turner,2011). Compared with conventional methods, PLE increasesthe extraction yield, decreases time and solvent consumption,and protects sensitive compounds. In their study, Schieffer andPfeiffer (2001) compared different extraction techniques likePLE, multiple USE, single USE, and Soxhlet extraction in orderto extract berberine from goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis).When compared in terms of extraction yield the results arecomparable,~42 mg/g berberine, except single USE with slightlylower content (37 mg/g berberine). Big differences were observedin the extraction time, PLE requiring only 30min for a singlesample extraction compared to 2 h for multiple extractiontechniques or 6 h for Soxhlet extraction (Schieffer and Pfeiffer,2001).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55736Neag et al.
