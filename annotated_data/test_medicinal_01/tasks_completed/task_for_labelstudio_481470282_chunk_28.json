In a randomised double-blind case-controlled crossover design, 27 consecutive eligible volunteers (13 hypertensive patients) were assessed at two consecutive visits one week apart. Participants were randomly assigned to first visit oral administration of 2800 mg of CM (four tablets of 700 mg IASIS Pharma Hellas S.A.) or placebo. At each visit, haemodynamic parameters were assessed at three distinct time points (baseline, 2 and 3 hours after administration). Haemodynamic assessment included non-invasive measurement of aortic systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure. The results showed hypertensive patients presenting acute decreases in peripheral and aortic SBP and in peripheral pulse pressure after CM administration. After adjustment for age, gender and body mass index (BMI), these differences retained significance while as compared to placebo. Finally, from gene expression analyses, CM administration in hypertensive patients tended to reduce the expression of proteasomal (PSMB6, PSMB7, RPN6), chaperone HSP27 and the pro-oxidant NOX2 genes (P < 0.1 for all); as compared to controls, in hypertensive patients PSMB6 and NOX2 expression was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) suggesting that CM exerts disease-specific regulatory effects on genes involved in proteostatic and pro-oxidant pathways. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate favorable effects of CM on peripheral and aortic blood pressure (BP) haemodynamics in hypertensive patients. The gene expression analysis pointed towards downregulation of the proteasome system and the NOX2 pro-oxidant pathway, which merits further investigation. Taken together, these findings should trigger further research of the role of CM in the management of hypertension.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org21620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP104. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of cannabidiol, in an Acute Autoimmune Hepatitis mice model.K. Mesiakaris1, M. Kaperoni1, K. Atsopardi1,2, M. Margarity2, K. Poulas11 Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Immunology, Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Greece2 Laboratory of Human and Animal Physiology, Department of Biology, University of Patras, GreeceCannabidiol (CBD) is a major active component of the Cannabis plant (Cannabis Sativa L.), which unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is devoid of euphoria-inducing properties. Broadly, CBD has demonstrated anxiolytic-like, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory benefits. Concanavalin A (ConA) is a lectin found in the jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis) and was studied for the first time by Jones and Johns (1916). ConA has been associated with a variety of toxicological effects (upon them mitogenic, cytotoxic and hepatotoxic). Intravenous administration of ConA is widely used for the induction of acute autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in mice and the injury is mainly driven by activation and uptake of T-cells in liver.The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-iflammatory and antioxidant effects of CBD on adult mice, with induction of AIH by ConA administration. Mice were pre-treated with CBD (20 mg/kg, oral administration) for five days and challenged with saline or ConA (20mg/kg; i.v.) on the fifth day. Anti-iflammatory analysis was assessed by determining the IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and INF-g levels on plasma serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antioxidant analysis was assessed by determining the GSH/GSSG ratio and SOD activity in liver tissue.The results reveal that IL-2, IL-4 and INF-g levels on plasma were increased after ConA intoxication (inflammation index) and were reduced when mice were pre-treated with CBD. The detected IL-10 levels where increased in pretreated with CBD mice, suggesting a protective anti-inflammatory effect. Moreover, GSH/GSSG ratio increases after CBD administration, indicating an increase in antioxidant potency. The SOD activity is increased at ConA group and reduced at the group that has been treated with CBD and ConA. In conclusion, CBD administration shows an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect when mice are pretreated with CBD, before the ConA injections.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 21720th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP105. Extract of Salvia haenkei presents anti-ageing activity in an in vitro human epidermal model.V. Cocetta1, J. Cadau1, D. Catanzaro1, I. Giacomini1, M. Saponaro2,3, G. Miolo1, E. Ragazzi1, A. Alimonti2,3,4, M. Montopoli1,21 Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padova, Italy2 VIMM Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine Padova, Italy3 Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Italy4 Institute of Oncology Research (IOR), Bellinzona, SwitzerlandSkin is a very complex organ that acts as a barrier for the body and plays various roles including homeostatic regulation, immune surveillance and temperature maintenance. Endogenous factors, in concert with external assaults, continuously affect the skin, leading to structural changes that influence its appearance and its various physiological functions. Skin aging is a biological phenomenon hugely related to exogenous factors such as ultraviolet radiation, pollutions, etc that results in cumulative structural and physiological skin changes. This process has been firmly related to a variety of skin disorders such as benign and malignant neoplasm, degenerative disorders, etc. It is thus clear that the maintenance of the integrity of the epidermal barrier and the slowdown of the skin aging processes are important in the prevention of skin diseases. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential anti-senescence activity of an extract of the Bolivian plant Salvia haenkei, which acts by reducing senescent cells affecting the IL1a release and reducing the ROS formation. This study was designed to investigate the effect of an extract of Salvia haenkei (SH) on HaCat human keratinocyte cell line as a model of the epidermis. HaCat cells were exposed to stress factors related to premature aging of cells such as ultraviolet radiation and radicals. The ROS scavenger activity was firstly confirmed in keratinocytes; interestingly it was found that SH can restore the barrier integrity compromised by UV-induced stress acting by reinforcing the cytoskeleton structure and sealing the tight junctions. Moreover, SH was found to be able to increase the migration velocity of the cells, suggesting an interesting role in improving the barrier functions of the skin. The results of this study identify useful roles of the extract of Salvia haenkei for anti-aging skin treatment and open new perspectives for its clinical use.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org21820th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP106. Antioxidant analysis of plant extracts' beverages prepared at home conditions.O. Kokoreva1,2, O. Tsiftsoglou2, C. Kontogiorgis1, D. Hadjipavlou-Litina3, E. Pontiki3, D. Lazari21 Laboratory of Hygiene and Environmental Protection, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece2 Department of Pharmacognosy-Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece3 Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GreeceAromatic plants took their name from the aroma that comes from those plants. These plants were known to people from ancient times. They were used as flavorings and medicinal potions.Today aromatic plants are again becoming popular. Their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties have found application in the food industry as natural preservatives, as well as in medicine as inexpensive drugs with a low number of side effects. Also, the problem of antibiotic resistance is pushing humanity to look for new methods of fighting bacteria. Today's treatments for infections are not as effective as before, this increases the duration of treatment and mortality.Smoking, UV radiation, environmental pollution, all this can increase the level of free radicals adversely affecting our health. Free radicals damage DNA, and as a result, damaged protein forms. These speeds up the aging process and stimulates the development of certain diseases. Antioxidants act as a natural shield against free radicals. And especially widely antioxidants are present in the plant world.In this diploma thesis will be studied 5 extracts and 5 mixed extracts from 5 aromatic plants. Samples which ware used in this study were extracted from plants grown in Thrace, namely: Althaea officinalis, Achillea millefolium, Calendula officinalis, Aloysia citrodora, Melissa officinalis. Mixed samples contain extracts of the above plants in different ratios: Aloysia citrodora & Melissa officinalis (50%/50%), Achillea millefolium & Calendula officinalis (30%/70%), Achillea millefolium & Melissa officinalis (20%/80%), Althaea officinalis & Aloysia citrodora (50%/50%), Althaea officinalis & Melissa officinalis (70%/30%). The purpose of sample mixing was to enhance the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.For research antioxidant activity, such methods were used as: DPPH, stable free-radical molecules, common antioxidants assay, the process of lipid peroxidation of linoleic acid by method of the linoleic acid (LLA) and the lipoxygenase inhibition (LOX).www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 21920th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP107. Silybin, curcumin and quercetin as metabolic modulators in human resistant cancer cells.I. Giacomini1, V. Cocetta1, D. Catanzaro1, E. Ragazzi1, M. Carrara1, M. Montopoli1,21 Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padua, Italy2 VIMM Veneto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, ItalyCisplatin and doxorubicin are chemotherapeutic agents used to treat human cancers. Despite their toxicity, the other issue that consequently leads to therapy failure is the onset of drug resistance. Among the main known resistance mechanisms, in the last decades also metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a possible one. For this reason, our laboratory has started research into natural compounds as possible modulators of metabolism to overcome resistance. Previously, we have already demonstrated that cisplatin and doxorubicin-resistant cells shift their metabolism toward a glycolytic and a lipogenic phenotype. With this in mind, after an initial screening of different natural compounds, our laboratory identified silybin, curcumin, and quercetin for their ability to modulate glycolytic and lipid metabolism. We performed cell viability assays to demonstrate the good toxicological profile of the three compounds. Moreover, the synergic effect of the combined treatment of silybin and doxorubicin was demonstrated on human adenocarcinoma cell lines. It was investigated the role of silybin in the modulation of glycolytic metabolism, evidencing that it was able to overcome doxorubicin resistance by reducing GLUT1 protein expression and glucose uptake. In parallel, we demonstrated the potential effect of the combination of curcumin or quercetin with cisplatin in human ovarian cisplatin-resistant cancer cell lines. We investigated the ability of these two compounds to modulate both glycolytic and lipid metabolism, concluding that curcumin and quercetin are able to sensitize cisplatin resistance acting on lipid metabolism. In light of the fact that these two compounds are able to potentiate the effect of cisplatin, our laboratory is still working on elucidation of the specific mechanism of action involved in the modulation of lipid metabolism.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org22020th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP108. Anti HSV-1 effects of 14-deoxyandrographolide from Andrographis paniculata.N. Zavogianni1, V. Dourdouni2, S. Dallis1, A. Kolosidou2, A. Karioti2, AR. Bilia3, C.A. Panagiotidis11 Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece2 Laboratory of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece3 University of Florence, Department of Chemistry, Florence, ItalyAndrographolide and its analogs are diterpene lactones isolated from the medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees, (Acanthaceae). These compounds have been reported to have a wide range of pharmacological activities, including anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antibacterial, anti-parasitic, anti-malarial, and anti-viral effects. In this report we describe a comprehensive isolation process, which allowed the rapid isolation of the three main components of Andrographidis herba, i.e. andrographolide (A), 14-deoxyandrographolide (DHA) and neoandrographolide (NA). The protocol included extraction with methanol, fractionation by vacuum liquid chromatography followed by column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20. Purity of compounds was assessed by NMR and HPLC-PDA-MS. The antiviral activities of the three isolated andrographolides, i.e. A, NA and DHA, were accessed using a recombinant herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 expressing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the HSV thymidine kinase promoter. Consistently with previous observations, we find that none of the three compounds possesses virucidal activity nor inhibits the early stages of virus infection, i.e. virus host-cell attachment or penetration. However, two of the compounds (A and DHA) were found to possess antiviral activity, although the results are complicated by the cytotoxic activity of one of the compounds (A). Further studies, using wild-type HSV-1 strain 17, verified the anti-HSV-1 effects of A and DHA and suggested that the effect takes place during the later stages of the virus life-cycle.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 22120th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP109. In vivo antimalarial activities of artemisinin and Vernonia amygdalina Del. leaf in mice.C. Ajayi1,2, H. Okella1, P. Ogwang1, A. Elujoba2, C. Tolo11 Pharm-BioTechnology and Traditional Medicine Center, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Mbarara, Uganda2 Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, NigeriaCombination therapy in the treatment of malaria and other diseases is a common practice in endemic regions. Recent alarming spread of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum (Pulcini et al., 2013; WHO, 2018) calls for a renewed intensive effort to develop new antimalarial drugs. This study investigated antimalarial activities of Vernonia amygdalina leaf (VA) alone and in combination with artemisinin on P. berghei ANKA-infected mice.Fifty mice were infected with malaria parasite (P. berghei) and later grouped into 10 groups of 5 mice 2h before administration. Groups I-IV were orally administered with distilled water (0.2mL), Chloroquine (10 mg/kg), Artemether-Lumefantrine (4 mg/kg) and artemisinin (10 mg/kg), respectively as negative and positive controls while groups V-VII were administered with infused extract of VA at 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg. Also, groups VIII-X were orally administered with infused extract of VA at same doses and concurrently administered with Artemisinin at 10 mg/kg. Administration of drugs was repeated for 4 days and the smears were taken on day 5 to determine the parasitaemia level with corresponding suppression effect.The result showed a dose dependent chemosuppression of 50-68% at 50-200 mg/kg. At 50 mg/kg, VA with artemisinin gave chemosuppression (60%) that was not significantly different from that of VA alone at 200 mg/kg (62%). The animals dosed with VA together with artemisinin were able to survive more than those dosed with VA alone and with artemisinin alone.The combination of artemisinin and VA in the study suppressed the parasitaemia growth in P. berghei infected mice. This combination can therefore be explored for antimalarial drug development.Pulcini S, Staines HM, Pittman JK, Slavic K, Doerig C, Halbert J, Tewari R, Shah F, Avery MA, Haynes RK, Krishna S (2013) Expression in yeast links field polymorphisms in PfATP6 to in vitro artemisinin resistance and identifies new inhibitor classes."
