The roots of B. diffusa contain alkaloids (punarnavine),rotenoids (boeravinones A-F), flavonoids, amino acids, lignans(liriodendrine, siringaresinols and mono-beta-D-glucoside), ss-sitosterol,tetracosanoic acid, esacosanoids, stearic and ursolic [2]. Although theB. diffusa have been widely attributed to a number of pharmacologicalactivities, currently there are no clear scientific data in the literaturethat confirm its efficacy. Based on the use of B. diffusa for the treat-ment of gastrointestinal diseases, the aim of our study was to: (i) as-sess, in vitro, the effect of a methanol root extract of B. diffusa on theintestinal smooth muscle, and (ii) to study the cytotoxic and antioxi-dant potential. For studies on intestinal motility were used segmentsof guinea pig ileum stimulated with exogenous contracturant agents(acetylcholine, histamine and barium chloride) or electric stimulation.The cytotoxicity assays were conducted on a cell line of human colonadenocarcinoma (Caco-2), while the antioxidant activity was evaluatednot only on Caco-2 cells, but also using a chemical assay of ElectronSpin Resonance (ESR). The mathanol root extract of B. diffusa (1-1000mg/ml) inhibited significantly and in a concentration-dependentmanner contractions of intestinal smooth muscle is induced by ex-ogenous agonists (acetylcholine, histamine and barium chloride), andelectrical stimulation. The inhibitory effect on contractions induced byacetylcholine was altered in the presence of nifedipine andcyclopiazonic acid, suggesting involvement of calcium channels in themechanism of action of the methanol root extract of B. diffusa. Chem-ical studies of antioxidant activity showed that the methanol root ex-tract of B. diffusa (0.1-5 mg/ml) reduced significantly and in aconcentration-dependent manner formation of free radicals, with itsIC50 of 0.7 mg/ml. The methanol root extract of B. diffusa used atconcentrations of 0.01-1 mg / ml, did not induce cytotoxic effects inCaco-2 cells. Furthermore, treatment of Caco-2 cells with methanolroot B. diffusa (0.03-1 mg/ml) significantly reduced the levels ofmalondialdehyde induced by Fenton's reagent suggesting a potentialantioxidant effect. In conclusion, this study has highlighted the spas-molytic effect of a methanol root extract of B. diffusa, which couldpartly justify the traditional use of this plant in the treatment of gas-trointestinal disorders and involve calcium channels. In addition, themethanol root extract of B. diffusa has not demonstrated in vitro cy-totoxic action, but a potent antioxidant activity that could justify itsuse in gastrointestinal disorders of oxidative etiology.Acknowledgment: This research was supported by Ministry of Educa-tion and Science, Republic of Serbia (TR31029)206Makedonski farmatsevtski bilten 57 (dodatok), 2011MEDITsINSKI I AROMATIChNI RASTENIJA poster prezentatsiiPETTI KONGRES NA FARMATsIJATA SO MEGjUNARODNO UChESTVOREFERENCES1.

Cyril and Methodius, Skopje Poisonous plants were known long ago. People gathered them formedical purposes in certain doses, as hunting poison, as well as in-secticides. There are over 700 types of poisonous plants (1.2). Historyof Pharmacy wrote about many poisonous plants that are now indis-pensable drugs. Empirical knowledge and experience were transferredto each subsequent generation. The introduction to the developmentof the ideas associated with poisonous plants, as well as the evolutionof knowledge increases the ability of pharmacists, physicians and tox-icologists to respond to the challenges that arise with the spread ofprofessional services in facilitating the life of human. The beginning of the use of plants, were probably accidental. Chinesepeople have first written monuments in the works of Shen Nung, theyear 2737-2698. BC, for the use of plants for healing, and from poi-sonous plants they used ephedra. Egyptians knew many poisonous plants i.e. henbane, common ivy, castoroil plant. The old desert peoples Phoenicians, Babylonians, Jews and Pales-tinians used among other poisonous plants even and opium. Illyrians hadknowledge of various poisons. The Dardanian tribes used poison conium.In the 5th century BC among the ancient people Bryonia dioica,Solanum dulcamara, conium, hellebore and castor oil plant were men-tioned. Among the ancient Greeks conium was used as a judicial poi-son. In Hippocrates works (459-370 BC), from poisonous plants opiumpoppy, henbane, belladonna, mandrake, castor oil plant, hellebore andAsarum europaeum were mentioned. Theophrastus (370-286 BC) in hisbook \"De historia plantarum\" wrote about the poisonous Veratrumalbum, opium poppy, mandrake, henbane, conium, Aconitum sp. Whiledescribing poisonous effect of plants Theophrastus emphasis the im-portant feature of human to get accustomed with the gradually in-creasing doses (3). Nikander (204-135 BC) wrote two poems Theriacaand Alexipharmaca, which is also the earliest work relating to poisonsand antidotes. Dioscorides (40-80 AD) in his work \"De venenis\", wroteabout poisons and antidotes with guide for the indications and con-traindications. In his study Dioscorides classified toxins according totheir plant, animal and mineral origin (4). In it he mentions toxicColchicum autumnale from surrounding the Black Sea. Dioscoridesmentions asarabacca for the treatment of fever, sciatica, as a diuretic,but today because of poisonous caused by azaron the use ofasarabacca is abandoned. Against intestinal parasites he used malefern, which is now rejected because of poisonous. Poisonous plants inRome were forbidden by law. Galen (129-200 AD) prepared \"Nut The-riac\" for Roman emperors, a remedy against bites, stings and poisons.He also wrote De Antidots I and II.Famed Arab toxicologist Ibn Wahshiya (9th AD) wrote toxicology trea-tise \"Book on Poisons\" combining contemporary science magic andastrology. Ibn Wahshiyah, warned of possible complications resultingfrom use of hashish (5). Arabs from poisonous plants used belladonna,henbane, Strychnos nux-vomica, Colchicum autumnale. In 9th centuryArabs transferred poppy to Persia, India and China. In the 9th century,there were mass poisoning with flour which had many impurities fromClaviceps purpurea. The disease was called \"ignis sacer\" and is mani-fested by severe muscle cramps, and later with gangrene of the lowerextremities. In medieval books were discovered first data on the use ofClaviceps purpurea deliveries, often accompanied by poisoning (6).Paracelsus (1493-1541 AD) introduced dose response concept to tox-icology. He wrote that \"All things are poison, and nothing is withoutpoison; only the dose permits something not to be poisonous.\" In themedieval period, women from higher layers in the eyes applied bel-ladonna as a cosmetics mean, for which the plant carries the nameBella-Donna. In 1763 year physician Storck from Vienna discovered thevalue of Colchicum autumnale as a specific tool against gout (6). Sincethen in the official European medicine was thrown away and shunnedbecause of the toxicity. In toxicological literature as a classic exampleof poisoning with belladonna's berries from ignorance, the case of col-lective intoxication of a group of 160 French solders was stated in1825 year (6). Because of opium two opium wars were fought, 1839-1842 and 1857-1860 between China on one side and England, USA andFrance on the other side (7). 19th century is the century of alkaloids.First Derosne isolated mixture of narcotine and morphine in 1803. In1806 Serturner purified morphine and Robik narcotine. Professorsfrom the high Pharmaceutical school in Paris, Peletier and Kaventu,discovered a number of important alkaloids: in 1817 brucine andstrychnine, in 1820 quinine. Peletier and Magendi in 1817 discoveredemetine, in the same year Geiger discovered aconitine, Runge caffeine,1842 year Voskresenski isolated theobromine, 1832 year Peletier re-veals narceine. French pharmacist Tanret in 1875 discovered (ergotinine)ergotoxin, and in 1878 peletierine and metilpeletierine. Today, many al-kaloids are successfully synthesized. However, still some poisonousplants are a major source and feedstock for the production of alkaloids. With chemical, physiological and clinical trials many forgotten poi-sonous plants i.e. Aconitum sp, belladonna, Datura stramonium, malefern, henbane, Claviceps purpurea, Veratrum album, poppy, Colchicumautumnale, castor oil plant, etc. are returned as a pharmaceuticals.Almost all the pharmacopoeias in the world prescribe their drugs withreal healing value. But there are cases where former officinal plantssuch as Bryonia dioica, male fern due to their high toxicity were aban-donment of scientific medicine (8). Some of them (Pulsatila vulgarisMill. ), are used in homeopathy. Many poisonous plants are used at different times throughout historyand were indispensable in treating many diseases for which has writ-ten data in many nations. Each of them contributed little to expandtheir knowledge and transfer of data from generation to generation.Despite the toxicity poisonous plants found wide application in med-icine in preventing or treating of various diseases.207Macedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANTSposter presentationsFIFTH CONGRESS OF PHARMACY OF MACEDONIA WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATIONREFERENCES1.
