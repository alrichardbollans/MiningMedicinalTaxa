(2003), the peaks showingparent [M-H]- ions at m/z 353, 337, and 367 were identifiedas isomeric caffeoylquinic acids (chlorogenic acids; 1, 4, 8),p-coumaroylquinic acids (3, 10, 12), and feruloylquinic acids(6, 14), correspondingly. The identity of chlorogenic acids wasadditionally confirmed by experiments with standards, as was thepresence of simple caffeic (7) and p-coumaric acids (13) givingthe typical [M-H]- ions at m/z 179 and 163, respectively. Thesame ions were found in MS2 spectra of compounds 2 and 9after neutral losses of sugar moieties (-162 Da each), which led tothe tentative identification of hexosides of caffeic acid and ferulicacid, respectively.Peaks 5, 11, 16, 18, 28, 30, and 37 with UV maxima at280 nm were classified as flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins.Based on standard spiking and literature data, compounds5 and 11 were characterized as (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, respectively. Compounds 16, 18, and 28 withparent ions [M+H]+ at m/z 577 were classified as dimericA-type procyanidins. These compounds gave secondary ionsin MS2 spectra at m/z 559, 425, and 287. The ions atm/z 425, arising from retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) fission of the[M+H]+ (577-152 Da), and the ions at m/z 287 (577-290Da) resulting from quinone methide (QM) fission, confirmedthe presence of two (epi)catechin units in the structures (Liand Deinzer, 2008; Hamed et al., 2014). Compounds 16, 18,and 28 were thus tentatively identified as (epi)catechin-A-(epi)catechins. Two A-type proanthocyanidins of that kindhave already been isolated from the flowers of P. spinosaand identified as ent-epicatechin-(4a-8;2a-O-7)-catechinand ent-epicatechin-(4a-8;2a-O-7)-epicatechin (Kolodziejet al., 1991). Compounds 30 and 37 with pseudomolecular[M+H]+ ions at m/z 561 and ions in MS2 spectra at m/z 543,409 and 271 were classified as dimeric A-type proanthocyanidins.The mass difference between compounds 16, 18, 28, and 30,37 was 16 Da, which indicated that in the latter molecules one(epi)catechin unit is probably replaced by (epi)afzelechin, theflavan-3-ol reported to occur in blackthorn flowers (Kolodziejet al., 1991) and branches (Pinacho et al., 2015). m/z 409(561-152 Da) arising from RDA fission of the [M+H]+ ion,confirmed the presence of (epi)catechin in both compounds.On the other hand, the product ions at m/z 271 (561-290Da) resulting from QM fission of the [M+H]+ ions, showedthat the upper unit in both cases was (epi)afzelechin, andhence the terminal unit must be (epi)catechin, m/z 287 (Liand Deinzer, 2008; Hamed et al., 2014). The structures ofcompounds 30 and 37 were thus tentatively identified as(epi)afzelechin-A-(epi)catechin. Two proanthocyanidins of thattype, i.e., ent-epiafzelechin-(4a-8;2a-O-7)-epicatechin andent-epiafzelechin-(4a-8;2a-O-7)-catechin have previouslybeen isolated from blackthorn flowers (Kolodziej et al., 1991).Peaks 15, 17, 19-21, 23-27, 29, 31-36, 38-54, and 56-59withtwo UV-Vis maxima at 250-268 and 355-365 nm were classifiedas flavonoids. Compounds 52 and 56 showed parent [M-H]-ions at m/z 301 and 285, respectively, and were identified withstandards as free aglycones quercetin and kaempferol. Peaks 23,26, 35, 36, 44, 47-49, 54, 57, and 59 with fragment ions in MS2m/z 285 (typical for kaempferol) were identified with authenticstandards of kaempferol glycosides (Table 1). Compounds 15,32, 33, 38, 42, 43, 45, and 46 were tentatively characterizedbased on their fragmentation pattern as kaempferol mono- anddiglycosides. Peak 53 with parent [M-H]- ion at m/z 635 andfragment ions at m/z 593, 285 in MS spectra was tentativelyidentified as kaempferol acetyl hexoside-rhamnoside due to theneutral loss of an acetyl moiety (-42 Da), hexose (-162 Da)and rhamnose (-146 Da). Peaks 24, 25, 27, 31, 34, 39-41, and50 with fragment ions in MS3 spectra at m/z 301 (typical forFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 680289Marchelak et al. Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower Extractsquercetin) were identified with standards of quercetin glycosides(Table 1). Compound 21 with pseudomolecular [M-H]- ion atm/z 595 and fragment ion at m/z 301 was tentatively assignedto quercetin hexoside-pentoside. Peak 51 with parent ion at m/z651 and fragment ions at m/z 609, 447, and 301 was determinedas a quercetin analog of 53, i.e., quercetin acetyl hexoside-rhamnoside. Similarly, compound 58was tentatively identified asan analog of 59, i.e., quercetin p-coumaroyl-pentoside, probablyquercetin 3-O-(2''-E-p-coumaroyl)-a-L-arabinofuranoside, dueto the additional UV-Vis absorptionmaximum at 316 nm (typicalfor an aromatic acyl unit), and the neutral loss of p-coumaroylmoiety (-146 Da) and a pentose (-132 Da). Peak 17 gave theparent ion at m/z 639 and its MS spectra revealed the cleavage oftwo hexoses (-162 amu twice) and the aglycone signal consistentwith isorhamnetin, which enabled tentative identification ofisorhamnetin dihexoside.Quantitative StandardizationAccording to the LC-MS findings, total contents of polyphenols(TPC), flavonoids (TFC), proanthocyanidins (TPA), andphenolic acids (TAC) were selected as standardization targets(Table 2). The TPC levels assayed by the standard Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed in gallic acid equivalents (GAE)varied in the range of 64.6-584.07 mg GAE/g dw of the extractswith the highest values found for EAF (584.07 mg GAE/g dw)and DEF (464.57 mg GAE/g dw)."
