Isolation and identification of components from the plant Hypericum empetrifolium.C. Samiotaki, G. Christoforou, K.M. Stefanakis, E. Stergiou, E.H. KaterinopoulosDepartment of Chemistry, Division of Organic Chemistry, University of Crete, Heraklion-Voutes, Crete, GreeceThe species Hypericum empetrifolium (Clusiaceae) grows mostly in Turkey and Greece. It is used in traditional medicine by the locals as a therapeutic agent for wound healing, antioxidant and against psoriasis. Aerial parts of the plant were collected during its blooming period, dried and extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus via the sequential use of increasing polarity: hexane, dichloromethane and methanol. The extracts were subjected to further extractions and column chromatography. Since the methanol extract contains the greater range of components used as therapeutic agents, the methanol extract residue was re-extracted with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate and n-butanol. Analysis of the polar extracts with NMR and ESI-MS techniques led to the identification of shikimic acid as well as a number of phenolic acids, including three \"chlorogenic acid\" stereoisomers (5-O-caffeoyl-(-)-quinic acid, 3-O-caffeoyl-(+)-quinic acid and 5-O-caffeoyl-epi-quinic acid) and the methyl esters of 5-O-caffeoyl-(-)-quinic acid and 3-O-caffeoyl-(-)-quinic acid. A second group of components contained the flavonoids quercetin, hyperoside, 3\"-acetyl avicularin, avicularin and guaiaverin. 3\"-Acetyl avicularin, 5-O-caffeoyl-epi-quinic acid and 3-O-caffeoyl-(-)-quinic acid methyl ester were identified from plants of the genus Hypericum for the first time, while guaiaverin and shikimic acid were identified for the first time from the species of Hypericum empetrifolium.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org17020th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP062. Essential Oil Content and Composition of Some Aromatic and Medicinal Plants from Greek Islands of South Aegean Region.A. Tsotskas1, E. Maloupa2, D.M. Lazari11 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Greece2 National Agricultural Research Foundation, Laboratory for the Conservation and Evaluation of Native and Floricultural Species, Thermi, Thessaloniki GreeceThe knowledge of the compounds in the essential oils is crucial when they are prepared for use in medicines and cosmetics. In this study the essential oil of the following plants have been analysed: Lavandula stoechas, Micromeria juliana, Mentha piperita and Mentha spicata, Salvia fruticosa, Satureja thymbra, Coridothymus capitatus and Thymus vulgaris. The above samples were selected from the Greek islands Andros, Naxos, Siros, Tinos and Crete. The plant material was extracted by hydrodistillation. Then, samples of collected essential oils were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The dominant compounds for Lavandula stoechas from Andros were camphor (51,0%), myrtenyl acetate (12,2%) and Fenchone (9,3%), for Micromeria juliana from Crete the major compounds were caryophyllene oxide (11,4%) and g-gurjunene (8,8%). The samples of Mentha species were found high in carvone (54.9%) for M. spicata from Tinos, iso-menthol (50,7%) and menthyl acetate (10,3%) for M. piperita. The major compounds of Salvia fruticosa were 1,8-cineole (49,1%) and camphor (19,6%). The main compounds for the samples of Satureja thymbra from Andros were g-terpinene (29,6%), carvacrol (28,2%) and thymol (14,4%). The principal compounds for Coridothymus capitatus from Crete were carvacrol (34,6%), thymol (19,5%), g-terpinene (15,9%) and p-cymene (11,9%). Finally, the main compounds of Thymus vulgaris from Andros were carvacrol (76,7%) and b-caryophyllene (6,3%). All these results could be assembled in a unified system, which could be continuously expanded. Finally, this will result in higher quality products, more economic products to obtain and reducing the risk to cause health problems, even to minimize them.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 17120th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP063. Ethnobotanical study of medicinal plants used for the treatment of skin disorders in Central Macedonia, Greece.E.E. Tsioutsiou1, P. Giordani2, E. Hanlidou3, M. Biagi4, A. Vontzalidou1, V. De Feo5, K.

While phytotherapy still maintains an important role in the treatment of many diseases in Greece, ethnobotanical studies on traditional uses of plants and their products are relatively scarce [1]. To this direction, our aim was to record ethnobotanical information concerning the traditional use of medicinal plants in Central Macedonia, focusing on plant species used for treating dermatological disorders, along with the development of propagation material for the conservation of the most prominent herbs. The study area was Macedonia region (Northern Greece) in the area of Edessa, Naoussa and nearby villages and ethnobotanical data were collected through semi structured interviews and summarized by indices as Fidelity Level and Informant Consensus Factor [2,3]. Among the reported plant species, we selected those reported for the treatment of wounds, warts, burns and insect bites and a number of them was cultivated in the Hellenic Agricultural Organization-DEMETER, while others were already stored in the seed bank of the Institute of Plant Breeding and Genetic Resources, HAO-DEMETER. More specifically, for species such as Matricaria chamomilla L. tissue culture methods were used and propagation was carried out under aseptic conditions leading to callus induction [4]. Some interesting remedies were also recorded in the study, such as the preparation of an ointment of fragmented fruits of Momordica charantia L., immersed in olive oil under sunlight exposition for 30-40 days, indicated for human and animal wound healing. Among the further goals of this work, is the development and the chemical profiling of the reported herbal preparations, the evaluation of their biological activity and safety using in vitro and cell-based assays, as well as the detection, isolation and identification of their substances.

The family Solanaceae in the Greek medical tradition.A. Touwaide1, E. Appetiti2, C. Grivas31 Division of Humanities, UCLA, Los Angeles, USA2 Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions, Washington, DC, USA3 Akadimia of Ancient Greek and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Athens, Greece Introduction: several species of the Solanaceae family have been present in Greece since ancient times and have been persistently used as medicinal plants. The main source attesting to their uses though Greek history is Dioscorides' De Materia Medica, which was continuously reproduced, consulted and used from the 1st cent. CE to late in the 19th century, including among Greek populations in the Ottoman Empire. This presentation will discuss the therapeutic uses of the Solanaceae species attested in Dioscorides' work.Material and method: we screened the Greek text of De materia medica in the original language, together with the representations of the plants in its manuscripts, including to exactly identify species, and we compared resulting data to the information to be found in earlier (Hippocratic Collection and Nicander) and later works (Galen, Oribasius, Aetius, Alexander of Tralles, Paul of Aegina, Hippiatrica, Geoponica, and edited iatrosofia).Results: with the exception of Mandragora, several of the supposed species of Solanum in ancient texts refer in effect to the same species. We also confirm the presence of Datura, supposed to be native to the New World. Uses were clearly perceived and were persistent through time, from ophthalmology to psycho-activity. Interestingly, this range of uses is still present in current traditional uses of the populations of Greece.Discussion: collected data will not only illustrate the continuity of uses (and, beyond, knowledge) of some Solanaceae species in the Greek World, but also assess the understanding of the physiological action of these species from antiquity to present day.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 17320th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP065. Phytochemical investigation of Paliurus spina-christi decoction prepared according to a traditional recipe.V. Amountzias, D. Abatis, N. AligiannisDepartment of Pharmacognosy & Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, GreecePaliurus spina-christi Mill. (Rhamnaceae) is a much-branched, deciduous, thorny shrub with green fruits that become brown during maturation. The shrub is found in Mediterranean, Southwest and Central Asia and North America. Its common name is \"Christ's thorn\" because it is said that its spiny branches were used to make the crown of thorns which had been placed on Christ's head before his crucifixion [3]. It is reported in the historical works of Dioscurides and Pliny as a diuretic, as well as palliative against gastrointestinal pain. Today, the decoction of the fruits of P. spina-christi is still used in the traditional medicine of Greece and Southern France for the same properties, as well as for the treatment of type II diabetes [1, 2, 4].The decoction of the fruits of P. spina-christi was prepared according to a Greek traditional recipe. The aqueous extract was treated with adsorption resin technology in order to remove sugars and other inorganic material. The resulting organic material was fractionated using Reversed Phase-Solid Phase Extraction (RP-SPE) and the interesting fractions were chromatographed by Reversed Phase-High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) to isolate the pure compounds. Structure elucidation was based on NMR spectroscopy and LC-MS.In this study we present some preliminary results of the phytochemical study of the decoction made from the fruits of Paliurus spina-christi. We have so far isolated and structure elucidated two cyclopeptide alkaloids (CPAs) that are new natural products. By elaborating LC-MS dereplication methodologies, we have also identified nine known secondary metabolites, 1 flavonoid-diglycoside, 2 phenolics, 1 triterpenoid, 1 lignan, 1 phytosterol and 3 CPAs, which had been isolated during a previous classical phytochemical analysis of the fruits. The decoction extract, as well as the SPE fractions and the pure compounds are currently under evaluation for their antidiabetic activity. [1] Ronchese, A. D., & Fiquet, C., 1952.

Chemical investigation of the recipe \"OINOS TRAGORIGANITES\" [Dioscorides].A. Charalabidis1, D. Abatis1, E. Gikas2, N. Proxenia3, Y. Kotseridis3, N. Aligiannis1.1 Division of Pharmacognosy & Natural Products Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens2 Division of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Pharmacy, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens3 Department of food science and human nutrition, Agricultural University of AthensIn the Greek \"Pharmacopoeia\" of 1931, \"Medicinal Wine\" is defined as the wine in which a medicinal plant has been extracted. In the ancient texts of Plinius, Galen and Dioscorides, however, there are recipes including the co-fermentation of must with several medical plant species, resulting in wines claimed to have a broad range of pharmacological properties.In the framework of our continuing effort to evaluate ancient Greek medical recipes, we worked on the \"MATERIA MEDICA\" recipe of \"OINOS TRAGORIGANITES\".OINOS TRAGORIGANITES [Dioscorides]SUGGESTED: Satureia thymbra, Thymus tragoriganum, Thymus graveolens, Micromeria thymbra -- Savory of Crete, Candian Savory -- Tragoriganum Wine Tragoriganites. Let down four teaspoonfuls of tragoriganum (bound in a linen cloth) into four pints of must [grape pulp] for three months and then jar it. It is good for griping, convulsions, hernias, pains of the side, the movement of winds, and difficulty to digest.The plant material (S. thymbra) was collected in the area of Attiki and the model must and model wine were provided by the Agricultural University of Athens (AUA). We used the upper parts of the plant and the fermentations/extractions were carried out in the laboratories of AUA, under controlled conditions in duplicate. We performed: 1. plant extraction in model wine in 3 plant/wine mixture analogies (3%, 6%, 9% w/v) and 2. plant/must co-fermentation in 3 plant/must mixture analogies (3%, 6%, 9% w/v). The wine extracts and the co-fermented solutions were then eluted from polymeric resins (XAD type) of different polarity (XAD4 and XAD7), in order to separate the secondary metabolites from the wine/must matrices (mainly sugars and organic/inorganic salts)."
