The grand vision of Frontiers is a world where all people have an equal opportunity to seek, share and generate knowledge. Frontiers provides immediate and permanent online open access to all its publications, but this alone is not enough to realize our grand goals.Frontiers Journal SeriesThe Frontiers Journal Series is a multi-tier and interdisciplinary set of open-access, online journals, promising a paradigm shift from the current review, selection and dissemination processes in academic publishing. All Frontiers journals are driven by researchers for researchers; therefore, they constitute a service to the scholarly community. At the same time, the Frontiers Journal Series operates on a revolutionary invention, the tiered publishing system, initially addressing specific communities of scholars, and gradually climbing up to broader public understanding, thus serving the interests of the lay society, too.Dedication to QualityEach Frontiers article is a landmark of the highest quality, thanks to genuinely collaborative interactions between authors and review editors, who include some of the world's best academicians. Research must be certified by peers before entering a stream of knowledge that may eventually reach the public - and shape society; therefore, Frontiers only applies the most rigorous and unbiased reviews. Frontiers revolutionizes research publishing by freely delivering the most outstanding research, evaluated with no bias from both the academic and social point of view.By applying the most advanced information technologies, Frontiers is catapulting scholarly publishing into a new generation.What are Frontiers Research Topics?Frontiers Research Topics are very popular trademarks of the Frontiers Journals Series: they are collections of at least ten articles, all centered on a particular subject. With their unique mix of varied contributions from Original Research to Review Articles, Frontiers Research Topics unify the most influential researchers, the latest key findings and historical advances in a hot research area!

Moreover, many of the modern pharmaceuticals were developedfrom molecules extracted from natural sources, and medicinal plants still today represent animportant pool for the identification of novel drug leads.The ethnopharmacological tradition in Central and Eastern Europe has a great historicalsignificance and large parts of the Western world's knowledge for therapeutic properties ofmedicinal plants has its roots in the Greek and Roman cultures (e.g., with a reference to theinfluential works of Dioscorides, Pliny the Elder, and Galen). The German-speaking CentralEuropean areas also have played very important roles, with some influential medieval herbalbook editions such as the Mainz Herbal (Herbarius Moguntinus, 1484) and The German Herbal(1485). Moreover, at the beginning of the nineteenth century modern drug discovery from plantsstarted to played a key role in Central Europe, most notably the work of the German apothecaryassistant Friedrich Serturner, who isolated an analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium thatwas named morphium (morphine) after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. At the same time,it should be noted that on many occasions the rich ethnopharmacological knowledge of someEast European countries and Russia remained localized and did not find its way to integrate withthe Western world of herbal therapy traditions. The focus of this Research Topic is to make aspecial contribution to ethnopharmacology rooted in Central and Eastern Europe, on the contextof global research developments in the area of ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, molecularpharmacology of natural products, nutrigenomics, and other related disciplines. This special issueconsists of 24 articles covering diverse topics related to the listed research fields.Advances in screeningmethods and analytical equipment, increasing number of targets availablefor testing, and improved possibilities for optimization of natural leads using syntheticmodification6Tewari et al. Central and Eastern European Ethnopharmacologystrategies substantially improved the process of moderndrug discovery from natural sources (Atanasov et al., 2015).Hypericum is a well-known genus that is used for its medicinalproperties.
