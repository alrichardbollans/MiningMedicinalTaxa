Limits of quantifica-tion, precision, and recovery were satisfactory. The benefit from short time analysis is not only in the increased sam-ple throughput, but also in dramatically decreased solvent consumption. Therefore, the liquid chromatography linked to fluorescence detection (HPLC/FD) was extensively used for OTA confirmatory analysis.

Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* blagicajovanova@hotmail.comIntroductionHerbal medicine has been used since ancient times for prevention and treatment of numerous diseases. Different cultures utilize numerous plant species which are usually characteristic for the geographical region where they are natively growing. The repeated use of herbal preparations for various purposes is commonly based on the positive ex-perience and the beneficial outcome of their usage as part of traditional medicine of the population.According to the World Health Organization statistics, 80% of the population relies on traditional herbal medicine as a primary healthcare system. Furthermore, more than 50% of the population in developed countries such as Ger-many (90%), France (75%) and Canada (70%) has at least once in their lifetime relied on herbal products as a pri-mary treatment. Beside the common practice of tradition-al herbal medicine, commercially available herbal products are also widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular dis-eases, allergies, asthma, arthritis and many other diseas-es. On the other hand, the increasing usage of herbal prod-ucts is becoming major concern of health regulatory bodies and the general public, mainly because of the high avail-ability of the herbal products on the market (Ekor, 2014). Moreover, a great portion of these products are classified as food or dietary supplements in some countries, making them easily accessible for the general public. The common perception of herbal products being generally safe regard-less of the administered dose is often misleading. There-fore, toxicity evaluation of commercially available herbal products is mandatory, considering the possibility of using their toxic potential in cytotoxicity studies.Materials and methodsPlant samples of 9 different species were tested for their toxic potential: 2 samples of bark (Rhamnus fran-gula and Quercus pedunculata), and 7 samples of whole herbal parts (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Epilobium parviflo-rum, Hypericum perforatum, Polygonum aviculare, Teu-crium chamaedrys, Viscum album and Galega officinalis).These samples are commercially available as one-com-ponent herbal teas and are commonly used for the treat-ment of various pathological conditions. The tested plant samples were prepared as methanol extracts, lyophilized, freeze dried and later reconstituted with DMSO (dimeth-yl sulfoxide). For the evaluation of potential toxicity among the selected herbal teas, the Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay (BSLA) was the most suitable method. BSLA is based on counting dead Artemia salina nauplii after their exposure to plant extracts in a certain time frame. The most relevant time period for the determination of LC50 is after 24 hours. After this period, dead nauplii were counted and the mor-tality of Artemia salina was calculated and expressed for each concentration of tested plant extract. The obtained re-sults for the mortality of the brine shrimps were further an-alyzed with regression analysis and LC50 values were ob-tained by application of probit regression analysis. Results and discussionAccording to the obtained LC50 values for the tested methanol extracts, the toxicological bioactivity is decreas-ing in the following order: Polygonum aviculare > Teu-crium chamaedrys > Capsella bursa-pastoris > Epilobi-um parviflorum > Galega officinalis > Rhamnus frangu-la > Quercus pedunculata > Hypericum perforatum > Vis-cum album.S3 PP 143306Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 305 - 306 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsOut of the tested plant samples, highest toxic potential manifested Polygonum aviculare (LC50 185 ug/mL) and the lowest toxic potential was obtained for Viscum album (LC50 590 ug/mL). The classification of the samples was done according to 2 scales: Meyer's scale and Clarkson's scale (Meyer at al., 1982; Clarkson et al., 2004). Meyer's scale classifies plant samples as toxic (LC50< 1000 ug/mL) and non-toxic (LC50> 1000 ug/mL). Clarkson's scale clas-sifies plant samples in several subcategories: plant samples with high (0 - 100 ug/mL), medium (100 - 500 ug/mL), low (500 - 1000 ug/mL) and no toxic potential (>1000 ug/mL). All tested samples were classified as toxic accord-ing to both scales, since the obtained LC50 values for each sample is below 1000 ug/mL. However, the tested plant extracts manifested a different level of toxicity. In accor-dance with the Clarkson's scale, Viscum album was clas-sified as a plant sample with low toxic potential, while the rest were classified as plant samples with medium toxic potential. The obtained results for the toxic potential of the selected herbs are in accordance with the literature re-sults. Thus, the anticancer effects of Polygonum aviculare were investigated against MCF-7 cells (human breast can-cer cell line). It has been shown that the methanol extract of Polygonum aviculare induced cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cell line, which confirmed the cytotoxic (anticancer) potential of this plant species (Habibi Roudkenar et al, 2011). Fur-thermore, the cytotoxic potential of the methanol extract of Teucrium chamaedrys against HCT-116 cells (human co-lon carcinoma cells) was evaluated. The obtained results have shown that Teucrium chamaedrys exhibited a signif-icant cytotoxic activity against the HCT-116 cells after 24 hour exposure (Stankovic et al., 2011).ConclusionAll tested herbal teas manifested medium toxic poten-tial, except for Viscum album which manifested low toxic potential according to Clarkson's scale of toxicity, but the mechanism and origin of this activity need to be further ex-amined and clarified. The Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay is a reliable preliminary tool to evaluate the toxic potential of plant samples. This is also supported by the good cor-relation between BSLA and other in vivo toxicity models. Therefore, the Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay is a conve-nient approach for a pre-selection of promising toxic plant samples that could further be examined for their cytotoxic potential in a more detailed research.

The aim of this study is to summarize the current extensive knowledge of the met-abolic aberrations in cancer and propose plausible mole-cules and pathways that could be targeted for specific treat-ment of this disease.Key concepts and clinical potential of the Warburg effectThe important discovery that highlighted the area of cancer metabolism is the Warburg effect, an anti-physio-logical way for energy generation used by the cancer cells for their proliferation. This effect explains the alteration of the normal process of oxidative phosphorylation follow-ing the process of glycolysis and excessive lactate produc-tion despite adequate oxygenation of the tissue, provid-ing an acidic environment that encourages the prolifera-tion and tumor invasion. Several studies have contribut-ed to the discovery of key biochemical pathways and their regulators, which can shed light on the field of cancer me-tabolism and can serve as new targets for cancer therapy (Semenza, 2011). One of the main metabolic features of all cancer cells is an increased utilization of glucose that offers several ad-vantages: the survival in an environment with unstable ox-ygen concentration which is otherwise fatal to normal cells referring predominantly to the oxidative phosphorylation as a source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), secondly the production of lactate as an end product of aerobic glycol-ysis makes acidic environment, which favors invasion of cancer and also suppresses the activity of anti-cancer im-mune effectors. Additionally, cancer cells utilize glycolyt-ic intermediates for anabolic reactions necessary for rapid proliferation, and, finally, the production of pyruvate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), the two main products of glycolysis and the pentose phos-phate cycle, are used by the cancer cells in order to deal with oxidative stress. Pyruvate catches hyperoxides while NADPH participates in the glutathione peroxidase medi-ated destruction of hydrogen peroxide (Singleterry et al., 2014). The essential role of glycolysis as a necessary process for cell proliferation is based on the fact that this process provides compounds with hydrocarbon skeleton, which are required for the biosynthesis of various biomolecules such as nucleic, amino and fatty acids. In spite of the fact that the process of oxidative phosphorylation provides greater amounts of ATP, the process of glycolysis is a much faster process of energy supply, and therefore is a more appropri-ate process to meet the large energy needs of cancer cells during active division. There are various types of deviation regarding the process of oxidative phosphorylation and ac-tivation of glycolysis used by cancer cells. One of them is activation of the enzyme phosphofructokinase, a key en-zyme for the process of glycolysis, by reduced produc-tion of ATP. Another approach implies changing the pH of the environment by reactive oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide. These radicals are known to cause intracellular alkalization which can activate the enzyme and thereby in-duce the process of glycolysis. Additionally, hydrogen per-oxide can also activate HIF 1 and the oncogenic RAS, SRC and MYC that are involved in the expression of enzymes and transporters participating in the process of glycolysis. Another major catabolic way that links the glucose metabolism to nucleotide biosynthesis and production of NADPH is the pentose-phosphate cycle. This process is necessary for the antioxidative surveillance and reduc-S3 PP 144308Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 307 - 308 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationstive biosynthesis. It is controlled by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate- dehydrogenase (G6PD), which activity is mediated by several signals and it serves as a sensor for the cellular NADP+ level. As glycolysis has a crucial role in the development of cancer, the Warburg effect can be used for therapeutic tar-geting of cancer metabolism. One approach is inhibition of the glycolytic enzymes involved in certain limiting steps of glycolysis, such as hexokinase 2 which ionizes the molecule of glucose and as such is retained inside the cell. A mole-cule that affects this enzyme is 2 deoxyglucose, a competi-tive inhibitor that cooperates with glucose for the active site of hexokinase 2, whereby with phosphorylation, this com-pound can't be further metabolized and accumulated inside the cell. The activity of the enzyme phosphofructokinase is also a potential target. The fact that this enzyme is very sen-sitive to small changes in pH and its action is induced by high pH values, the inactivation of the Na/H+ pump NHE1 which excretes H+ ions from the cell, may lead to decreased intracellular pH, decreased activity of phosphofructokinase and inhibition of the process of glycolysis, endangering the survival of cancer cells. Molecules that inhibit the activi-ty of the Na/H+ pump NHE1 are amiloride and 5,5-dimeti-lamiloride. Lactate dehydrogenase is another enzyme that contributes for the Warburg effect which may serve as a tar-get for aerobic glycolysis in the heart.Another approach for reducing the glycolysis level in cancer cells is by inhibiting the synthesis of glucose trans-porters and glycolytic enzymes. HIF1 is a transcription fac-tor that controls the activity and its inhibition is assessed in multiple studies. As a result, several Food and Drug Ad-ministration approved anticancer drugs such as topotecan, imatinib, celecoxib and ibuprofen have proven to inhibit the activity of this factor. The role of G6PD as an oncogene makes this enzyme a potential therapeutic target. Hense, the combination of oxythiamine and dehydroepiandros-terone, has an additive inhibitory effect over cancer cells. This indicates that the combinatory targeting of the pentose phosphate cycle and other metabolic pathways may be an effective approach to selective suppression of cell growth.Targeting the glutamine metabolismThe dependability of the cancer cells survival on the aerobic glycolysis solely has been discredited by research showing that glutamine metabolism is also essential for certain types of cancer. Recent studies demonstrate the vi-tal need for this amino acid, its buffering effect against ox-idative stress, the role of a mediator in intracellular sig-naling, and as a quality control of macromolecules and or-ganelles (Shanware et al., 2011). Crucial enzymes involved in the glutamine metabolism such as isocitrate dehydroge-nase, are found to be mutated in certain types of cancer, such as gliomas and acute myeloid leukemia, hense target-ing this enzyme may be an alternative anti-cancer thera-py. Other two important enzymes that control the gluta-mine metabolism are glutamate dehydrogenase and gluta-mate aminotransferase."
