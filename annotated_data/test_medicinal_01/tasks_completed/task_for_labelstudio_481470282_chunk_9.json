Despite its importance as a medicinal herb, the first systematic analysis of the non-volatile constituents was reported recently by the work of Chatzopoulou et al., [2] which revealed a variety of phenolic compounds. Continuing this work extended studies on the chemical content of aerial parts, roots and herbal teas of cultivated O. dictamnus were undertaken. Targeted isolations guided by HPLC-PDA-ESIMS and NMR analyzes enabled us to create an in-house chemical library, but also revealed the presence of new constituents reported for the first time. Up to now more than 60 constituents have been identified, among them seven new natural products belonging to the classes of flavonoids, jasmonates and monoterpene derivatives. Preliminary experiments with dittany infusions on rabbit intestine confirmed the ethnopharmacological use of the herbal drug in mild gastrointestinal disorders, as they produced a dose-dependent relaxing effect both in the jejunum and colon. At the threshold concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml for the colon and 0.3 mg/ml for the jejunum, dittany produced a slight decrease in both the phasic contractions and the basal tone, while at higher concentrations it caused a significant decrease in the tone and a considerable inhibition in the amplitude and frequency of the phasic contractions.

Discovering herbal teas/mountain teas in Kozani-Western Macedonia-Greece, an ethnopharmacological journey.E. LampretsaEarth's Pharmacy, Kozani, GreeceWild native herbs have been widely used in alimentation and constituted the main form of traditional medicine by creating the first therapeutic approaches to treat a huge variety of symptoms. Gaining a deeper understanding of the potential benefits that herbs hold would undoubtedly aid in treating contemporary diseases. The region of Kozani, Western Macedonia in Northern Greece combines diverse altitude, multiple rivers and soil of great biodiversity value, that gives rise to a number of region-specific herbs. Moreover, only a few studies have investigated the traditional uses of medicinal herbs in Kozani, thus underlining the necessity of a systematic study of their traditional uses in health and disease.Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate the traditional medicinal herbs of Western Macedonia, primarily focusing on their consumption as hot drink infusions-tea in accordance with their therapeutic applications. To investigate the medical value of the herbs we have created an oral questionnaire comprising 20 questions and accompanied by photos and samples of the local herbal plants. The candidates were selected based on their age and their origin.This study constitutes the only recent effort to register the vast variety of medicinal plants in Kozani, Western Macedonia. Among the various uses of mountain tea that came up in the study, it is noteworthy to pinpoint \"Mountain tea\" Satureja montana, Stachys iva and Sideritis sp for treatment of the symptoms of the common flu and cough, Achillea coarcata for hypertension, Teucrium for diabetes, while other famous herbs such as Chamomilla recutita and Salvia sclarea have also emerged. Future studies will focus on increasing the number of candidates as well as the range of the area studied. Finally, it is evident from this study that traditional knowledge and ethnopharmacology could prove to be invaluable in identifying novel therapeutic compounds.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org8820th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyO23. Expanding the scope of Greek Ethnopharmacology - eurasian medicinal plants on the Mediterranean.A. Touwaide1, E. Appetiti21 Division of Humanities, UCLA, Los Angeles, USA2 Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions, Washington, DC, USAAnalysis of Greek ethnopharmacology traditionally considers the materia medica native to Mediterranean region. A close examination of documentation dating as far back as the remotest antiquity shows, however, that this approach is limited as it does not take into consideration the materia medica introduced into the Mediterranean region from as far as China. This presentation will focus on this non-native materica medica. It will be based on a systematic screening of Greek ancient texts dating from the 5th cent. BCE to the 15th, and will trace the presence of this materia medica, made of plants and other natural substances coming not only from China, but also from all the regions either between China and the Mediterranean, or connected to the sea or land roads through which these substances were traded, that is, the whole Eurasia. This presentation will then compare the uses of this materia medica in the Greek texts and their equivalent in the pharmacopoeitic literature of the native regions of this materia medica. This will bring to light both the persistence of uses from the regions of origin of traded substances and new ones, possibly generated in the regions crossed by the materia medica. This will suggest that trade was not limited to transmission, but also included assimilation of local uses and new applications of traded substances in a thus far unsuspected way. In conclusion, when Eurasian medicinal plants reached the Greek World, they conveyed with them a multiple and diversified knowledge of their therapeutic properties and applications that benefitted and enriched Greek ethnopharmacology.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 8920th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyO24. Ethnopharmacological study of the medicinal plants used in the folk medicine in Drama, Nothern Greece.S. Tsiotsiou-Papaemmanouil1, D. Lazari1, D. Hadjipavlou-Litina2, T. Dardavesis31 Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece2 Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece3 Laboratory of Hygiene, Medical School, Faculty of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GreeceA complete ethnopharmacology survey was conducted in the Drama district of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. Ethnobotanical knowledge is passed on orally from one generation to another. Special formed questionnaires were used to elicit information on the medicinal plants used to cure common ailments. Primary information was collected from local interviewees, mostly elderly men and women, residents of the aforementioned area. The survey subjects, natives or immigrants from Asia Minor and the Aegean Sea coastline, which used to be Greek territories before becoming Turkish after the population exchanges. Various data (information, recipes) are collected concerning plants with alleged therapeutic properties, and which are used to date as a treatment offered to both humans and livestock for various medical issues. The survey was conducted following a documented protocol specifically designed for the particular project. In some cases, animals, animal products, commonly used objects and chemicals are used alone or added to the medicinal plants to enhance their curative abilities. The findings emerged from this ethnopharmacological survey are very interesting. The verification of the data of the medicinal plants used in traditional healing practices in Drama clearly shows the need to document these practices, and the wealth of undocumented knowledge out there. The current study reinforces the importance of extending the study to other parts of Greece.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org9020th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyO25. In the course of thyme: the use of Thymus spp. in European traditional medicine & the example of Thymus thracicus.T.K. Papagrigoriou1, O.St. Tsiftsoglou1, D.I. Hajipavlou-Litina2, D.M. Lazari11 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Greece2 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, GreeceSince the beginning of human history, thyme has been an indispensable medicinal plant, employed for the treatment of various ailments, ranging from the severest to the most common ones. From the ancient Greco-Roman manuscripts to modern Pharmacopeias, knowledge, passing on from one generation to another, has survived until today with extensive studies validating the effectiveness of thyme extracts. From ancient Greco-Roman herbaria to modern Pharmacopeias, knowledge passing on from one civilization to another, has survived until today, with extensive bibliography validating the effectiveness of thyme extracts. A sub-endemic Balkan species of thyme, Thymus thracicus Velen. has been the focus of our research, which has resulted in the isolation of nine polyphenols so far, namely oresbiusin A (1), rosmarinic acid (2), methyl rosmarinate (3), 9\"-methyl lithospermate (4), dimethyl lithospermate (5), luteolin-7-O-glucuronide (6), calceolarioside A (7), 3-methoxy-calceolarioside A (8) and grayanoside B (9). The chemical structures of the isolated compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR analysis (1H, 13C, gDQCOSY, gHSQCAD, gHMBCAD), and through comparison with the literature. A series of in vitro assays followed suit, mainly focusing on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the isolated compounds, accompanied by preliminary in silico studies, which, in turn, yielded moderate results concerning the compounds' potentiality to act as ligands for nuclear and G protein-coupled receptors, suggesting possible directions for future research.Acknowledgements: The authors are grateful to Dr. Nikos Krigas (Researcher in National Agricultural Research Foundation, Laboratory for the Conservation and Evaluation of Native and Floricultural Species, Thermi, Thessaloniki Greece) for the collection and identification of the plant material.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 9120th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyO26. Galen's formulas in his book on antidotes.C. Grivas1, E. Appetiti2, A. Touwaide31 Akadimia of Ancient Greek and Traditional Chinese Medicine, Athens, Greece2 Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions, Washington, DC, USA3 Division of Humanities, UCLA, Los Angeles, USAAccording to Galen the term antidote is used in regard to formulas addressing a general category of internal diseases that could involve a poisoning, an attack by a venomous animal, or an improper way of living. A subgroup of antidotes, named theriacs from the Greek word for wild animal, could address all three categories. Galen's text De antidotis contains over 100 formulas for compound medicines, from relatively simple to very elaborate ones, as for example the one hundred-ingredients' theriac, designed by Galen himself. Containing formulas composed by at least 50 pre-Galenic physicians and therapists, the Galenic work is a good example of a major collection of standardized compound drugs, reaching approximately 28,000 words. A detailed textual study of these formulas revealed interesting information on the Greek and Roman pharmacy. A fifth of these formulas can be considered large, exceeding a total of 30 ingredients. Almost half of these ingredients were imported from Africa, Arabia or India, pointing to a thriving trade of medicinal substances and spices. Several of these herbal, animal and mineral drugs were expensive, rare or extravagant, even for a wealthy Roman physician. De antidotis represents one of the most important formularies of classical antiquity, which was instrumental for the spreading of theriac through the world (e.g. Tibet, China and Japan) or even adapted locally by other medical traditions (e.g. Brazil). Although the text remains underexploited, it is nevertheless a rich source of herbal knowledge with promising candidates for future research.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org92Pharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsOrals20th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsO27. Artocarpus tonkinensis, a remedy from Vietnamese ethnopharmacology, protects mice against collagen-induced arthritis and decreases Th17 cell function.S. Adorisio1, I. Muscari2, T.T. Thuy3, D.V. Delfino1,21 Foligno Nursing School, Italy2 Secion of Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy3 Institute of Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Hanoi, VietnamArtocarpus tonkinensis (Moraceae) is a tree that grows in north Vietnam whose leaf decoction is used as a traditional remedy by the Hmong ethnic group to treat arthritis and backache. Our study evaluated the decoction's efficacy and mechanism of action in DBA/1J mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). CIA are characterized by chronic joint inflammation mediated by IL-22 produced by Th17 cells, which stimulates synovial fibroblasts to induce cell proliferation and secretion of other inflammatory cytokines, and the initiation of osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, IL-6 produced by fibroblasts responding to Th17 cell-derived IL-17 amplifies inflammation and stimulates synovial tissue in an autocrine manner. Thus, IL-17 maintains the inflammatory cycle via activity of downstream cytokines. Mice treated with the decoction (At) (5 g/100 mL, ad libitum) either from the first collagen immunization or after CIA development experienced significantly less joint edema and inflammatory infiltration, whereas CIA-induced cartilage damage could only be prevented by early At treatment. Autoimmune gene expression profiles showed that Th17 cell-associated chemokine CCL20, the chemokine receptor CCR4, the cytokines IL-6, IFN-g, IL-17, and IL-22 and the IL-23 receptor were strongly downregulated by At. Reduced expression of IL-2, IL-17, IL-22, and FasL in lymph node cells from At-treated mice was further confirmed by real-time PCR. The decoction also inhibited polarization of Th17 cells from CD4+ splenic T cells according to levels of IL-17 and RORC, a Th17 cell-specific transcription factor. Chromatographic analysis identified At's major component as maesopsin-b-D-glucoside, which could inhibit in vitro differentiation of Th17 cellsIn conclusion, although some questions remain regarding the mechanism of At-mediated Th17 cell attenuation, our findings highlight the importance of investigating traditional ethnomedicines for treatment of diseases. The potential anti-inflammatory activity of At provides an alternative RA therapy apart from methotrexate and corticosteroids that should be explored further with respect to its optimal efficacy and possible non-specific cytotoxic effects.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org9420th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsO28. In vitro assessment of anti-influenza activity and neuraminidase inhibition of Cistus creticus L. subsp. eriocephalus (Viv.) Greuter & Burdet grown in sea coast area of South Tuscany, Italy.M. Biagi1, G. Baini1, E. Miraldi1, C. Terrosi2, M. G. Cusi21 University of Siena, Department of Physical Sciences, Earth and Environment, Italy2 University of Siena, Microbiology Unit, Department of Medical Biotechnologies, ItalyCistus creticus L. subsp. eriocephalus (Viv.) Greuter & Burdet (formerly Cistus incanus L.) is a perennial shrub, common on sunny or rocky soils in Mediterranean area. Leaves and aerial parts of C. creticus have been traditionally used in Greece and Italy to treat several respiratory infections. Also, in South Tuscany, in the sea coast area of Maremma, C. creticus subsp. eriocephalus is used as herbal tea to treat cold symptoms and flu. In this work, we chemically characterized, and we investigated two ethanolic extracts (ethanol 65% v/v) obtained from samples of C. creticus subsp. eriocephalus (CIS) aerial parts collected in two different sites of Maremma for their in vitro activity against influenza A H1N1 strains in pre- and post-cell infection on MDCK cells. We also evaluated anti-neuraminidase activity of the extracts by calculating IC50. Oseltamivir was used as reference drug. CIS ethanolic extracts, in the same manner, were found effective as anti-influenza drugs by strongly inhibiting influenza virus entry in MDCK cells (cytotoxic/effective concentration ratio >4) and, partially, by reducing viral replication. IC50 in anti-neuraminidase activity test was below 0.025 mg/ml for both extracts. Chemical analyses showed that extracts are very rich in polyphenols (20.3%-23.0% m/m of extracts). Flavan-3-ols oligomers occur in CIS samples as main polyphenols subclass (11.3%-14.2%) and these constituents are likely to contribute more to the antiviral efficacy [2]. Also flavonols (4.3%-4.9%), mainly represented by myricitrin and other myricetin and quercetin glycosides, are an important chemical class of the extracts. Our findings suggest that C. creticus subsp."
