Fam. Cannabi-naceae) is very popular nowadays because of its medical use. The plant Cannabis sativa L. is a source of a number of drug products. Marijuana represents the dried top parts of female hemp plant in flower. The main ingredient in hash-ish is the resin secreted by the glandular hairs found all over the plant but mainly around flowers. In addition, the cannabis plant can be used as a source hemp fibers, as well as hemp seeds and fatty oil (Kovacevic, 2000). Throughout human history cannabis has been used for many purposes such as recreation, therapy, art, religion, food, medicine, as a textile. This plant was also used for treating insomnia, healing and also as painkiller. Each culture and subculture from prehistory up to now use this plant because it causes selective changes in consciousness of its consumers strict-ly dosing what is beyond reality, and also for medical rea-sons. Today, cannabis is forbidden in many countries be-cause of its narcotic and negative influence to the nerve system. In some cultures cannabis is a protected mark, oth-er cultures are its big admirers and third do not know or do not look on that way about cannabis (Tyler et al., 1988). Canada is first country in the world that has offers med-ical marijuana to its patients since 2003. Therefore, there is an increased necessity of research on the history of can-nabis for the sake of reinforcing the ability of pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges arising in the provision of professional services in order to facilitate hu-man life. Chronology from the past to the present History of cannabisCannabis is one of the oldest psychoactive plants known to humanity. It grows as weed and cultivated plant all over the world in a variety of climates and soils. Histor-ical records and archaeological materials date from 6000 BC pointing out the use of cannabis seeds for food in Chi-na. In 4000 BC textiles made of cannabis are used in Chi-na. Remains have been found of cannabis fibers from this period and a century later. First recorded use of cannabis as a medicine was in 2727 BC in Chinese pharmacopoeia. In 1500 BC cannabis is cultivated in China for food and fi-ber. Scythians cultivated cannabis and use it to weave fine hemp cloth. According to Herodotus they introduced can-nabis into Europe (Tucakov, 1948). Bhang, composed from dried cannabis leaves, seeds and stems is mentioned in the Hindu sacred text Atharva veda as \"Sacred Grass\", one of the five sacred plants of India. It is used medicinally and ritually as an offering to Shiva. Scythian tribes leave canna-bis seeds as offerings in royal tombs. This closely matches the Herodotus reports on both ritual and recreation use of cannabis by the Scythians. The psychotropic properties of cannabis are mentioned in the newly compiled herbal Pent Ts'ao Ching which is attributed to an emperor Shen Nung. He recommended it against malaria, constipation, rheu-matic pains, and absence of the spirit, female problems and a mixture of cannabis, resin and wine as an analgesic dur-ing surgery (Booth, 2003). Cannabis as psychoactive plant is respected from Buddhists. In an old testament is men-tioned as a sacred plant in holy anointing oil prepared from myrrh, laurel, cinnamon and \"kaneh bosm\"- identified by linguists as cannabis (Teodorova et al., 2005). Dioscorides S5 PP 227478Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 477 - 478 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsin 70 AD mentions the use of cannabis as a Roman medi-cament while Galen in 170 AD alludes to the psycho activ-ity of cannabis seed confections. The Jewish Talmud men-tions the euphoria properties of cannabis. Ancient Greeks and Romans were also familiar with cannabis, while in the Middle East, use spread throughout the Islamic empire to North Africa. In the early 12th century hashish smoking is very popular throughout the Middle East. Cannabis is in-troduced in Egypt during the reign of the Ayyubid dynas-ty in 12th century. Arab traders bring cannabis to the Mo-zambique coast of Africa in 13th century. Marco Polo dur-ing his journeys from 1254-1324 gives reports that Assas-sins are using hashish (Mez-Mangold, 1971). In 1545 can-nabis spread to the western hemisphere where Spaniards imported it to Chile for its use as fiber. In North America cannabis, in the form of hemp, was grown on many plan-tations for use as rope, clothing and paper. In the late 17th century hashish becomes a major trade item between Cen-tral Asia and South Asia. Napoleon discovers that much of the Egyptians habitually used hashish. His soldiers in their returning to France bring the tradition with them in 1798 year (Tucakov, 1948).Medicinal properties of cannabisMedicinal use of marijuana arrived in Europe from the East during the 18th century. It was brought to Eu-rope much later, but it was not less popular. It reaches the high society very soon. In Paris, a club was open where many famous people, even Balzac, enjoyed marijuana. The first comprehensive description of the medical use of In-dian hemp in Europe was written in 1830 by the German pharmacist Friedrich Ludwig Nees von Esenbeck. Until that point in time, use of marijuana for medical purpos-es had remained at a low level. Thanks mainly to the work of W.B.O'Shaugnessy in 1839 marijuana become recog-nized within European - school medicine. He used various hemp compounds in his investigations, partly with great success, against rheumatism, rabies, cholera, tetanus, con-vulsions and delirium tremens. In America in 1840 medici-nal preparations with cannabis base are available in Persian pharmacies. Hashish's eater's club is established in Paris in 1843 and after 1850 hashish appears in Greece (Booth, 2003). Cannabis begins to prohibit for nonmedical use in the US during 1915-1927. The prestigious US Institute of Medicine published its report Medical Use of Marijuana in 1999 (Weiner, 1990). Recent studies reviewed by Park et al. 2004 that marijuana, THC and other exogenous canna-binoids exert potent effects on the endocannabinoid sys-tem in both the gonads and during pregnancy (Frankhaus-er, 2008). ConclusionCannabis preparations have been used as remedies for thousands of years and the active ingredients of the plant can be put to use in a multitude of medical conditions. Can-nabis has been used throughout history in many different cultures to change mood, perception and consciousness. Its effects range from increasing creativity to provoking mys-tical experiences, to heightening the capacity to feel sense and share. The reports established the evidence base sup-port for the further examination of cannabis products for medical use. ReferencesBooth, M., 2003. Cannabis - a history.

Juniper cones have long been used in medicine, food and the cosmetic indus-try. In the traditional medicine, preparations of juniper cones are used as folk remedy mostly against rheumatic complaints (Mustafa et al., 2012). In addition to the man-ifold and diverse chemical composition of secondary me-tabolites found in Juniper cone oil, it also has different bi-ological activities, including hypoglycemic, carminative, antioxidant, antiseptic, and antibacterial activity (Hajdari et al., 2015). Chemical composition of essential oils of J. nana has been reported by several authors (Filipowicz et al., 2006; Proenca da-Cunhaa and Roquea, 1989). Previously we studied the composition of essential oils in two Juniperus species J. communis and J. oxycedrus re-spectively growing wild in Kosovo (Hajdari et al., 2015). On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies that address the composition of es-sential oils obtained from J. nana, therefore the principal aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composi-tion of the essential oils obtained from ripe cones, branch-es and leaves of this plant harvested from wild population in Kosovo. Materials and methodsPlant materials (ripe cones) of Juniperus nana were collected in wild populations in locality Hajle, Bjeshket e Nemuna, Kosovo (Latitude, 42deg 45' 12'' N; Longitude, 20deg 07' 59'' E; Altitude, 2029 m). Voucher specimens of each population were deposited with the Herbarium of the De-partment of Biology, University of Prishtina. For the es-sential oil extraction the plant material was air-dried in the shade at room temperature, prior to processing and chemi-cal analysis. The ripe cones were chopped up in small piec-es, and the essential oils were obtained by hydrodistilla-tion using a Clevenger apparatus for 3 hours. The sam-ples were stored in the dark at -18 degC in a freezer until further analysis. The yield of essential oil is expressed as the volume percentage of the dry mass of the air-dried plant material. GC/FID analyses were performed using an Agilent 7890A GC system equipped with an FID detector (Agilent Technologies). The separation was conducted on a HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm with a 0.25 mm film thickness). Helium was used as the carrier gas with an ini-tial flow rate of 0.6 ml/min and then at a constant pressure of 50.0 psi. The front inlet was maintained at 250 degC in a split ratio of 50:1. The GC oven temperature was increased from 60 degC to 260 degC at a rate of 5 degC/min, and the FID was operated at 250 degC with an air flow of 350 mL/min and a hydrogen flow of 35 mL/min. The injection volume was 1.0 mL.GC/MS analyses were performed using an Agile-nt 7890A GC system coupled to a 5975C MSD (Agile-nt Technologies). The ionisation energy was 70 eV with a mass range of 40 - 400 m/z. The separation was conduct-S5 PP 228480Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 479 - 480 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsed using the same column and temperature program as for the analytical GC.The identification of each of the components of the es-sential oil was performed by comparing their Kovat's re-tention indices with those from the literature. The Kovat's index was calculated based on a linear interpolation of the retention times of a homologous series of n-alkanes (C9-C28) under the same operating conditions. The components were also identified by comparing the mass spectra of each constituent with those stored in the NIST 08.L and WI-LEY MS 9th databases and with mass spectra from the lit-erature. Furthermore, some of the main peaks were iden-tified by comparing the retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic constituents. The percentage com-position of the oils was computed using the normalization method from the GC peak areas, calculated as the mean of three samples, without correction factors. Results and discussionIn total 75 constituents were identifies in the essential oils obtained from the juniper cones, leaves and branch-es. Principal constituents were monoterpenes: a-pinene (24.7-36.7%); sabinene (8.2-22.9%); myrcene (4.3-1.6%); D-limonene (2.4-4.4%); b-pinene (1.6-2.4%); ter-pinolene (1.0-1.9%). Concentration of oxygenated mono-terpene, terpinene-4-ol was 1.4-7.5%. Monoterpenes were followed by sesquiterpenes: germacrene D (2.0-7.9%); a-caryophyllene (0.4-2.1%); bicyclogermacrene (0.3-2.2%); b-caryophyllene (0.1-1.9%); zonarene (0.5-3.1%); d-cadinene (0.7-3.9%); germacrene B (0.2-1.1%); b-elemene (0.3-1.9%), whereas concentration of the oxy-genated sesquiterpene, 1-epi-a-cadinol, ranged from 0.7-4.1%. In regard to the percentages of essential oil constit-uents in different drug organs, experimental data revealed that monoterpenes were the most abundant constituents in berries, whereas the highest concentration of sesquiter-penes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes was in branches. Re-sults are in the accordance with previously published data where a-pinene and sabinene were principal components of J. nana (Filipowicz et al., 2006). In Portugese sample, the major hydrocarbon components of the oil were a-pinene (20.0%), d-cadinene (10.4%), limonene (8.7%), and myr-cene (8.5%) (Proenca da-Cunhaa and Roquea, 1989). ConclusionThe study of chemical composition essential oils ob-tained from berries, branches and leaves of J. nana grow-ing wild in the Bjeshket e Nemuna region in Kosovo repre-sents a contribution in the field of the essential oil constit-uents of the genus Juniperus. The main essential oil com-ponents were a-pinene, followed by sabinene, myrcene and germacrene D. ReferencesFilipowicz, N., Piotrowski, A., Ochocka, J.R., Asztemborska, M., 2006.
