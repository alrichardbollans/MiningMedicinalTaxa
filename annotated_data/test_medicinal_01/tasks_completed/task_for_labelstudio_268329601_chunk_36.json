      "text": "We have to figure outa way to trap the alcohol and change it back frombeing a gas to a liquid.All of this is accomplished in a place called a distillery,in a device called a distilling apparatus or still. Theequipment consists of: (1) a boiler, the vessel orcontainer in which the material is heated; (2) acondenser that returns the gas to its liquid phase; and(3) a receiver in which the end product is collected.The boiler may be heated by coal, wood, or steam. Ontop of the boiler is a hood of some sort, a device fortrapping the alcohol vapors. The gas travels throughthin metal pipes, often made of copper, to acondensing coil. It is a section of metal tubing bathedin cold water. The temperature of the alcohol vapordrops below 173E F and it changes back to its liquidstate. The alcohol now trickles out of the condenserinto a receiving pan or vessel of some sort. There areseveral different kinds of stills. Some of them have thegrace and elegance of a large, ugly hot water tank,while others are extremely handsome pieces ofequipment.TYPES OF DISTILLED BEVERAGESWhiskey (also spelled whisky) comes from twoScottish and Irish words meaning the \"water of life. \"It is a very popular drink made from cereal grains,although potatoes are sometimes used. Whiskey isusually aged in white oak casks. This aging may lastfor several years. The alcohol content is about 50%(or 100 proof, another way of describing alcoholcontent). Several different kinds of whiskey are incommon use. Bourbon or corn whiskey is madefrom at least 51% corn mash. It was first concocted inBourbon Co., Kentucky by the Rev. Elijah Craig, aBaptist minister. Irish whiskey is made from abarley mash. The malt is kiln-dried. Rye or ryewhiskey is made from at least 51% rye mash.Scotch or Scotch whiskey is made from barleymash that is cured in the smoke of a peat fire. -124-Gin is distilled to obtain nearly pure alcohol. The mashis usually of maize and rye. Various aromatics, such asthe juniper berry (Juniperus spp.) or sloe berry(Prunus spinosa) are added for flavor.Vodka is from the Russian word for water. For allpractical purposes, it is pure ethanol. It is made froma wheat-malt mash and it is unflavored and unaged.Rum (rhum or ron) is distilled from sugar-cane juiceor from molasses to which water and yeast are added.It is then distilled to yield an alcohol content of about80-150 proof. It is aged in oak, usually for 1 to 10years. Various flavorings are often added. Most of ourrum comes from the Caribbean. Tequila, a favorite Mexican drink, is made by distillingthe fermented juice from a century plant (Agavespp.). The highest quality is obtained by using 100%blue agave, a cultivar of A. tequileana. Plants that areabout 10-12 years old are harvested. After the leaveshave been cut off, what remains is a 75-150 lb. plantpart that the locals call a \"pina\" or \"cabeza.\" It issometimes called the fruit of the plant, but that isincorrect. The agave heads are cooked in ovens,cooled, and then put through mechanical crushers thatseparate the juice from the solid material. Yeasts areadded to the agave juice to begin the fermentationprocess. The fermented mash will then be distilled.Tequila is a very popular drink these days. Premiumlabels sell for as much as $300 a bottle; $20 a shot atyour fancy upscale bars down in The City. Brandy is made by distilling wine or fermented fruitsother than grapes. It is usually aged in wood. Thealcohol content is about 40-50%. Cognac, named afterthe French city, is probably the best known brandy.Absinthe is the most dangerous and notorious of thedistilled beverages. It is a green liqueur made of oil ofwormwood (from a kind of sagebrush, Artemisiaabsinthium), fennel, star-anise, and other aromatics.Sale of absinthe was banned in France in 1915, withthe United States and many other countries adoptingsimilar restrictions. Curiously, in 2005 Switzerland willonce again allow limited production.The toxic principles appear to be l-thujone and d-isothujone. On the other hand, a mixture of absintheand anisette is reported to be excellent in treatingmotion sickness. A reformulated version of absinthe,called pernod, appeared in 1922. It lacks thewormwood, but retains the anise base.Over indulgence causes:' mania;' convulsions;' irritation of the gastrointestinal tract;' stupor;' hallucinations;' extreme nervousness;' loss of hearing and sight;' coma; and ' death.Akvavit is a favorite Scandinavian drink made fromgrains or potatoes flavored with caraway seeds.Bitters is made from various herbs and flavorings.The alcohol content is about 40%. Angostura bitterscontains quinine and several aromatic substances,including the angostura bark from Galipea, a memberof the citrus family.Liqueurs or cordials are made by combining brandywith a series of flavorings, often by simply addingdried fruits. Common examples include apricotcordials, creme de cacao, and creme de menthe.DISTILLED BEVERAGESProduct Plant Source Commentabsinthe grape, wormwood spirit flavored with oil of wormwoodakvavit (aquavit) potato and caraway distilled potato starch and caraway fruitsarrack rice, sugar cane, palm distillate of fermented grains and palm juicebrandy grapes distilled grape winecognac grapes distilled grape winefruit brandy apples, plums, etc. distilled fruit winesgin maize, rye, juniper grains malted, fermented, and distilledguaro sugar cane The national drink of Costa Ricaliqueurs grape and sugarcane spirits, sweetened and flavored with herbsmezcal century plant distillate of fermented sap and pulpokolehao (oke) rice, dasheen molasses-flavored; aged in charred barrels; Hawai'iraki (ouzo) various plants distillate of wine, grain, potatoes or molassesrum sugar cane juice fermented and distilledtequila century plant distillate of fermented sap and pulpvermouth grape and wormwood fortified wine flavored with herbsvodka rye, potato, wheat distilled potato or grain starchwhiskey barley, maize, and rye grains malted, fermented, and distilled-125-8.0 * INDUSTRIALLY IMPORTANT PLANTS8.1 ! AN OVERVIEW' Many of our great industries are based upon theextraction and processing of various woods,fibers, fixed oils, essential oils, latexes, gums,resins, starches, dyes, etc. from plants.' Still others are involved with a host of productsderived from micro-organisms, such as carefullymaintained cultures of yeasts needed for breadmaking and brewing, and other fungi that areused in medicine.' In some instances, a plant is killed duringprocessing to extract a particular product.' In other cases we have developed refinedtechniques that allow us to remove what wewant, but to keep the plant alive.' The importance of some plants, such as Pararubber, was linked to technologicaldevelopments; in this case the invention of thepneumatic tire and the internal combustionengine. Before that, it was an interestingcuriosity with limited potential.' As the natural sources have been exploited anddepleted, we find it increasingly necessary tocreate synthetic substitutes for these extractives.8.2 ! FIBER PLANTS\"Fiber plants are second only to food plants in termsof their usefulness to humans and their influence onthe advancement of civilization. Tropical people useplant fibers for housing, clothing, hammocks, nets,baskets, fishing lines and bowstrings. Even in ourindustralized society, we use a variety of natural plantfibers.... In fact the so-called synthetic fibers nowproviding much of our clothing are only reconstitutedcellulose of plant origin.\" [Mark Plotkin, 1988]' ' ' ' 'The category \"fiber plants\" is an artificial one,including not only true fibers based on anatomicalorigin, but also a number of miscellaneous plants andplant parts that are loosely called fibers. Woody planttissues also contain fibers, but they are treated in thenext section.GENERAL FEATURES OF FIBER CELLS' Long and slender, with tapering ends; ' About 1-250 mm long and about 1/100 to 6/100mm wide;' Dead at maturity;' Comparatively thick walls;' Central opening (lumen) is typically quite small;' Occur in clusters.The cell wall of a fiber consists of cellulose,hemicellulose, and lignins. Often, especially in thecase of high quality fibers, the cell wall is almost purecellulose.TYPES OF FIBERSSoft, stem, or bast fibers occur toward the outside ofthe stem, when viewed in cross-section. For those ofyou with a general botany background, bast fiberstypically lie in the cortex, phloem, and pericycletissues. Common examples include flax, hemp, ramie,and jute.Hard, leaf, or structural fibers usually come fromleaves, typically from some kind of monocot, such asthose in the century plant family. The leaves are oftentough, with the fibers embedded in a pulpy matrix.Common examples include sisal, Manila-hemp, andNew Zealand flax.Surface fibers are derived from surfaces of seedsand interior walls of fruits. The most important ofthem are fibers derived from the seeds, with cottonbeing the pre-eminent example. In addition to cotton,kapok, cotton-grass, and several species of milkweedsyield surface fibers.PROCESSINGStem or bast fibers usually occur in bundles,cemented together by a middle lamella. The fibers arefreed from one another by a process called retting. Itinvolves their partial decomposition in water by micro-organisms. The water may be dew or rain, or thefibers may be submerged in lakes, rivers, or tanks.After retting, the fibers may be scutched, a processof smashing the stems between fluted rollers. Thecentral core and bark of the stem are separated fromone another.Leaves are scraped and pounded to separate thevascular bundles from a pulpy matrix around them.Traditionally this was done by hand, but now amachine called a decorticator is used. Because somuch manual labor is involved, hard fibers are oftengrown and processed in tropical countries whereinexpensive labor is available.The processing of seed fibers involves ginning, inwhich the fibers are caught on toothed disks or combsand are then pulled through openings too small for theseed itself to pass.Once fibers have been extracted they may be putthrough additional machines to align them with oneanother (combed), stretched (attenuated), and thentwisted to interlock them to yield yarn. It is thentwisted in the opposite direction to produce cord,which is used to make rope, which is used to makecables.-126-HOW DO WE USE FIBERS?Fibers may also be classified according to their uses:textile fibers are used primarily in the fabricindustry. Cotton, flax, ramie, hemp, and jute arecommon examples.cordage fibers are used to make twines and ropes.Jute, cotton, hemp, abaca, sisal, and New Zealand flaxare common examples.brush, plaiting or braiding fibers are used to make brooms, brushes, mats, hats, baskets, rugs, screens,etc. In this category, the fiber strand can be braidedor folded. Examples include a variety of palms,bamboos, herbaceous grasses, and sedges.filling fibers are used for stuffing, caulking, andreinforcing. Kapok, cotton, several of the hard fibers,Spanish moss, and many grasses fall into thiscategory.paper-making fibers are used to make paper. Whowould have guessed it? There are purists, however,who will argue that hemp, paper mulberry, papyrus,kenaf, rice paper, and various bamboos do not give us\"paper,\" but only a writing surface. Real paper, theysay, can be made only out of wood fibers and ragsthat have been reduced to a pulp and thenreconstituted. See Section 8.3 for a discussion ofpaper-making.FLAXFlax is one of the oldest fibers. It comes from Linumusitatissimum, a member of the flax family (Linaceae).From the time of the ancient Egyptians until about the19th century, it was the leading fiber plant. Now it isrelatively unimportant. Flax seeds are the source oflinseed oil.Flax is retted, either in dew or it is immersed in waterfor one or two weeks. After retting, the fibers arescutched. The central core and bark are separatedfrom one another. Commercial flax is derived from thebark. The fiber is superior to cotton in many ways.Flax fibers can absorb up to 20% of their own weightin water and they are stronger wet than they are dry.For this reason, hey are prized as towels.HEMP\"Hemp is intertwined with American history. We grewit to rig the great New England sailing ships, traveledwest in Conestoga wagons covered in hemp cloth,dressed in homespun hemp cloth when we got thereand wound up wearing hemp jeans. We tied our cargowith hemp rope and fed the poultry with hemp seed.We used hemp to help develop this country.... GeorgeWashington said, 'Make the most of hemp seed. Sowit everywhere.\" (Willie Nelson) ' ' ' ' 'Like flax, hemp (or hempen) fiber is another plantwith a long history of use. Its fiber is similar to that offlax and it may be used as a substitute for it. Hemp(Cannabis sativa) is native to Asia. The plant is notonly the source of a valuable fiber, but it also yieldsedible seeds (used for birdseed), oils, andpsychoactive resins. The stems are allowed to ret for3-8 weeks, usually in the dew of fields. They are thenscutched. Hemp is used in cordage, in rather coarsefabrics, and to caulk wooden sailing ships, a need thatseems to be declining. Until the latter part of the 19thcentury, hemp was a major source of fiber formanufacturing paper. Its present day advocates havelaunched an educational campaign to grow it onceagain for that purpose, thereby saving our forests.A COMPARISON OF HEMP & PINE PAPER PULPHemp Pine trees80% conversion to pulp 43 % conversion3-20% lignin 30% ligninRequires less bleaching Requires more3-8 tons dry wt. per acre 2-4 tonsTIMELINE: HEMP FIBERBCE:8000 Earliest fiber remains at Catal Huyuk4500 Spreads from Central Asia to China2800 Emperor Shen Nung teaches Chinese tocultivate2700 Use widespread in Old World170 Oldest extant specimens of hemp paper CE:100 Chinese first to make paper from hemp1150 Moors open factory in Spain (first inEurope)1533 Henry VIII requires farmers to grow hemp1545 Spanish introduce hemp to New World1563 Elizabeth I renews Henry's decree1564 Philip I of Spain orders use in Central &South America1611 King James Bible printed on hemp1619 Jamestown colonists directed to growhemp1637 Families in Hartford, CT ordered to plant 1tsp. of seed1645 Puritans introduce into New England1753 Linnaeus publishes Cannabis sativa asscientific name1776 Drafts of Declaration of Independencewritten on hemp1807 Treaty of Tilset controls sale of hemp1812 U.

Manila-hemp, Indian-hemp, and sunn-hemp are notkinds of hemp. See the \"Survey of Fiber Plants\" tablefor more details.PAPYRUS\"Papyrus sheets preserve the thoughts and deeds ofman.\" (Leonardo Da Vinci)This writing material of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks,and Romans was prepared from the stems of anaquatic sedge, Cyperus papyrus. The plant is native tocentral Africa and the Nile Valley. It is naturalized insouthern Europe. The plant is a typical member of thefamily, in that its stems are solid, rather than hollow,as in the grasses. The Egyptians perfected thetechnique of cutting strips of tissue, placing themparallel to one another, smashing them together witha smooth rock and water from the Nile, and thendrying them to form papyrus. The process wasrecorded by the Greek historian Herodotus, in the 5thcentury B. C. E.Although our modern word \"paper\" comes frompapyrus, purists on the subject do not refer topapyrus as paper."
