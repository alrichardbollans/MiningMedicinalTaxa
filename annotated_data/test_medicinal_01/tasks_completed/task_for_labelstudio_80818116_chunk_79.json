Cyclodextrin-based nanoassemblies as drug carriersSupramolecular cyclodextrin-based nanoassemblies mediated by host-guest interactions have gained increased popularity because of their \"green\" and simple preparation procedure, as well as their versatility in terms of inclusion of active molecules (Gref et al., 2012). Here we show that original nanoparticlesof around 100 nm are spontaneously prepared in water, by a lock and key mechanism involving formation of inclusion complexes between CDs on one wa-ter-soluble polymer and hydrophobic side chains on anoth-er one (Anand et al., 2012; Battistini et al., 2008; Daoud-Mahammed et al., 2009; Fraix et al., 2013; Othman et al., 2011). Whatever the mixing conditions, nanoparticles with narrow size distributions arespontaneously formed upon the contact of two polymeric aqueous solutions. Ad-vantageously, the production of the nanoparticles can be scaled-up using a microfluidic device. In situ size measure-ments helped understanding the mechanisms involved in nanoparticle self-assembly. Individual nanoparticle track-ing analysis enabled to establish that despite the non-co-valent nature of the nanoassemblies, they were remarkably stable, even upon extreme dilution (few ng/mL). Contrast agents bearing adamantly moieties were incorporated into the nanoassemblies, showing high relaxivities (Battistini et al., 2008). Spectroscopic and photophysical studies helped understanding the interactions involved in the nanoassem-blies loaded or not with drugs (Anand et al., 2012). Final-ly, another set of examples shows the utility of the nano-assemblies for bimodal anticancer phototherapy (Fraix et al., 2013).ConclusionThis study paves the way towards the \"green\" scal-able formation of supramolecular assemblies with poten-tial uses in cosmetics and drug delivery.ReferencesAnand, R., Manoli, F., Manet, I., Daoud-Mahammed, S., Agostoni, V., R.Gref, S.

Both natural geomaterials and their deriva-tives are attracting growing attention in a variety of fields and in particular as biomaterials. Pharmaceutical technolo-gy is not an exception and geo-source excipients are com-peting well with the synthetic materials.Pharmaceutical uses of geomaterials: from conventional to innovativeFor thousands of years, humans have been using avail-able substances to achieve specific functions, including their use in contact with living tissues, organisms or mi-cro-organisms. Like most of the materials used by humans, geomaterials are widely mentioned in the literature, and occasionally exploited clinically, as such, as devices or as part of devices to treat trauma and diseases. These classi-cal used of geomaterials in health care applications will be revised.In recent decades, research in biomaterials and their use in healthcare have increased all over the world. Ap-plications of biomaterials in human healthcare include the development of new medical devices and prostheses, tis-sue engineering, bone regeneration, implants and surgi-cal tools, diagnostic techniques, bioadhesives, artificial or-gans and drug delivery (Larsson et al., 2007). Biomateri-als for medical applications must be biocompatible, and ei-ther bioresorbable or biodurable. Nanotechnologies and in-organic-organic hybrid technologies are currently two of the most active approaches to achieve these requirements. Many organic-inorganic hybrid materials and nanotech-nology based targeted drug delivery systems imply the use of geomaterials. Arrangement, structure and properties of pharmaceutically interesting geomaterialsSome geomaterials, and significantly carbonates (and carbon structures), phosphates and silicates (special clays and zeolites) induce no adverse effect in contact with a liv-ing organism (biocompatibility) and their presence may be beneficial (bioactivity) or without any significant health ef-fect (bio-inert) but with biodurable properties. The specif-ic function that a geomaterial have in any formulation de-pends on its composition, structure and properties, includ-ing both physical properties (particle size and shape, spe-cific surface area, texture,...) and chemical features (sur-face chemistry, charge,...).Calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate are natural nanosized geomaterials than can be used in drug delivery and tissue engineering. Calcium phosphate nanoparticles can be tailored to be biocompatible and show high adsorp-tion capacities to be used in controlled and targeted drug release.It must be also remarked all the possibilities in med-icine of graphitic forms deriving from graphene as fuller-enes, carbon nanotubes and graphite. The possibilities of these carbon materials in health care products are a new frontier of pharmaceutics (Hong et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2012; Sanchez et al., 2012).S4 OP 158338Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 337 - 338 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsCalcium carbonate appears as three different anhy-drous crystalline polymorphs: calcite, aragonite, and vat-erite. Under standard conditions for temperature and pres-sure, calcite is the stable phase, while aragonite and vater-ite are the metastable forms that readily transform into the stable phase. Vaterite and other polymorphic forms of car-bonate are receiving great attention as nanocarriers in drug delivery.Silicates, including some tectosilicates, as zeolites (Cerri et al., 2016), but mainly phyllosilicates (clay min-erals) have also featured in pharmaceutics due to their ad-sorptive and ion exchange properties (Aguzzi et al., 2007). These minerals appear abundantly at the surface of the Earth as natural nanoscale particles with layered structures and interlayer spaces, which have potential to play a sig-nificant role as biomaterials. Structurally, the layers, with thickness around one nanometre, consist in most cases of one or two tetrahedral silicate sheets and one octahedral metal oxide/hydroxide sheet. Many clay minerals form sheet-like particles or platelets, for example, kaolinite (a 1:1-type clay mineral) formed by one tetrahedral sheet and one octahedral sheet, or talc, vermiculite, montmorillonite or saponite and others (2:1-type clay minerals), which are composed of an octahedral sheet sandwiched between two tetrahedral silicate sheets. Chemically, clay minerals are hydrous aluminium or magnesium phyllosilicates, usually with variable amounts of iron, magnesium, alkali metals, alkaline earths, and other cations present either in the in-terlayer space or in the lattice framework by isomorphous substitution. Uses of clay minerals in healthcare include traditional applications but also, as a result of the nano-metre-scale layering, interlayer spacing and strong electro-static interactions, the possibility of developing functional materials for such advanced technologies as nanotechnol-ogy and, in particular, biomaterials. Clay minerals and ze-olites have been proposed as carriers of drugs, genes and proteins (Lopez-Galindo and Viseras, 2004). The investi-gation of geomaterials-drug interaction and release mech-anisms is an essential contribution for the formulation of geomaterial-based drug delivery systems. The possibilities of such systems depend on the amount of drug retained by the geomaterial as well as on the release kinetics and the total amount released in regard of the therapeutic regime.Some polymorphic forms of silicates resulted in struc-tures with particular interest. As for example, natural min-eral nanotubes comprise hollow tubular minerals with na-noscale diameters.Modification, functionalization and polymer conjugation of geomaterials.Sometimes, properties of natural geomaterials cannot achieve the desired objectives, requiring their modification or functionalization as well as the incorporation into poly-meric matrices to obtain nanocomposites with improved properties compared to the individual components (Viseras et al., 2008). All these improvements are notably prompt-ing the availability of optimized and well characterized geomaterial-derivatives, suitable for a wide range of bio-medical applications.Concluding remarksThe therapeutic advantages of geomaterials in the de-sign and development of technologically advanced drug products make this field of investigation a high-priority de-velopment area in which the development of new applica-tions will require the close collaboration of pharmaceutical technologist with geologist, and chemists.ReferencesAguzzi, C., Cerezo, P., Viseras, C., Caramella, C., 2007.
