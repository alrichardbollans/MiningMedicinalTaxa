Brief description of proposed amendment 238 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra One of the objectives set in the initial proposal (version 3) was 'to gain an insight into healthcare professionals knowledge and understanding of traditional herbal medicines used in South Asian communities in the UK'. A questionnaire and Participant Information Leaflet (PIL) has now been created to fulfil this objective. The questionnaire has been designed to gain an insight into healthcare professionals' personal and professional opinions of traditional herbal medicines. The term healthcare professionals (HCPs) refers to those who have regular clinical contact with patients. The main focus for this study will be on General Practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists as they are at the frontline of dealing with minor health problems which may be treated with herbal medicines. In addition, for the purpose of this exploratory research other HCPs who may also have had opportunities to discuss herbal medicines with their patients will also be given the chance to participate (i.e. including nurses, dentists and opticians). The questionnaire will be administered as a postal questionnaire to GPs and Pharmacists across Birmingham and Leicester, whose addresses are readily available in the public domain (i.e. directories/ the internet). Hence, the style of the PIL is similar to a cover letter. Survey monkey (an online survey software) will also be used to publish the same questionnaire online in anticipation of reaching more people and getting a larger response rate. An opportunity sampling technique will be employed as healthcare professionals known to the research team will be asked to participate and forward the link for the online survey to other healthcare professionals to complete. 10. Rationale for the amendment Page 6 of the ethics proposal highlighted that separate ethical approval will be sought at a later stage depending on the progress of the study. After assessing the progress of the study, it is now at a stage where this objective can be explored. 11. Please list each potential ethical issue relating to your study and state how these will be addressed: include potential risks to participants and research staff The Participant Information Leaflet (PIL) has been carefully worded to prevent harm being caused to participants. A PIL produced by the GPhC was used as a template to tailor this to healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals who use traditional herbal medicines may feel hesitant to share this information but anonymity and confidentiality will be assured. All postal questionnaires will be returned to De Montfort University and not the researchers personal address to ensure personal details of the researcher are kept safe. 239 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Appendix 2B HCPs Questionnaire Ethics Review Reply Re: Ethical Approval Application - Investigating the use and identity of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian communities using biomolecular techniques. (Ref: 1113) Reviewers comments: Applicants response: I was unable to find any information in the application paperwork about who is included in the definition 'healthcare professionals' and how they will be recruited. The proposal doesn't seem to have been extended from the original to include details about this section of the study - sample size, inclusion criteria, recruitment methods etc. so it is difficult to give an ethical opinion on the work to be completed. This links directly to the issue of NHS R&D approval. If the research is proposing to recruit NHS healthcare professionals, we might expect to gain this. I am assuming this is not the intention, but clarification needs to be sought on whether it is needed - dependent on the sample and the means of recruitment. We need an update on this specific phase of the study and clarification of whether NHS R&D approval is required. Clarification of Healthcare Professionals: The term healthcare professionals (HCPs) refers to those who have regular clinical contact with patients. The main focus for this study will be on General Practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists as they are at the frontline of dealing with minor health problems which may be treated with herbal medicines. In addition, for the purpose of this exploratory research other HCPs who may also have had opportunities to discuss herbal medicines with their patients will also be given the chance to participate (i.e. including nurses, dentists and opticians). Not only are we are looking for healthcare professionals who may have experience of discussing the use of herbal medicines with patients but we also want to know their personal views and opinions of herbal medicines. Recruitment methods: The postal questionnaire will only be sent to GP surgeries and pharmacies whose addresses are readily available in the public domain (i.e. directories/ the internet). Once the target locations have been agreed (with supervisors) we will collate a list of address to post the questionnaires to. If ethical approval is granted I will seek advice from my supervisor (Prof. Mark Johnson) and DMU staff who have experience with this form of questionnaire distribution (e.g. Peter Rivers, Sandra Hall etc.). An online version of the questionnaire which will be published via Survey Monkey can be completed by any healthcare professional if they are interested in participating. An opportunity sampling technique will be employed as healthcare professionals known to the research team will be asked to participate and forward the link for the online survey to other healthcare professionals to complete. Sample size: There are no defined parameters for the sample size as this exploratory research is an open survey which will be running in the background while the main themes of the research are explored. The survey will be available online for a year, from the date of publishing the questionnaire, as this is the duration of the license we will purchase for the online survey software. Inclusion criteria: Participants must be over 18 years old so participants can consent for themselves. Participants must be a healthcare professional, either practicing or retired. The healthcare practitioner must have practiced in the UK at some point in their career (no specific time period). The rationale for posting questionnaires to GP surgeries and pharmacists is because these healthcare professionals are the first port of call in a community setting (i.e. primary care) who will deal with minor ailments which may often be treated with herbal medicines. Hence we are most interested in the views and opinions of GPs and 240 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra pharmacists. However, as this is an open survey with the intention to explore healthcare professional's views and opinions of herbal medicines anyone who is a healthcare professional and wishes to participate can do so. This is so we can get a variety of healthcare professional's views and opinions of herbal medicines. NHS R&D approval: Advice from several colleagues from DMU and external NHS ethics advisors has been useful in clarifying whether or not NHS R&D approval would be required. Including: Maggie Barrett - Senior RM&G Facilitator (Leicestershire, Northamptonshire & Rutland Comprehensive Local Research Network). Debbie Wall - Research & Development Manager, NHS Leicester City (awaiting a response). As we will not be using the NHS to recruit participants or conduct/ host the research; we have no sponsors and will not require any patient details we would not require NHS ethical approval. I am currently working on completing the IRAS forms to get assurance from Debbie Wall to clarify this. 'Research involving staff as participants REC review is not normally required for research involving NHS or social care staff recruited as research participants by virtue of their professional role.' - See more at: http://www.hra.nhs.uk/resources/before-you-apply/research-requiring-nhs-rd-review-but-not-ethical-review/#sthash.QIjBvS5h.dpuf Exceptions to the need for REC review Subject to any overriding legal requirements, REC review is not required for the following types of research: -Research limited to the involvement of NHS or social care staff recruited as research participants by virtue of their professional role. - Research involving use of or access to a care organisation's premises or facilities, but not otherwise involving patients or service users. - See more at: http://www.hra.nhs.uk/resources/research-legislation-and-governance/governance-arrangements-for-research-ethics-committees/#sthash.LkrVSzts.dpuf In relation to ethical issues raised, the researcher has not indicated what they would do if a participant were to reveal dangerous or poor practice in this questionnaire. The questionnaire will be anonymous as we are not asking for any personal/ identifiable details (for example registration/ license details are not required). If dangerous practices were identified there would be no way of identifying the participant so we wouldn't be able to address them even if they were identified. The nature of this questionnaire has been designed with the intent of exploring the healthcare professionals' views and experience with herbal medicines, not their professional practice. 241 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Appendix 2C NHS R&D Approval Letter 06.05.2014 Study Ref: LCCR 200214 End Date: 31.03.2015 Project Status: Approved Dear Miss Sukvinder Bhamra Re: Investigating the use of traditional herbal remedies I am pleased to confirm that Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group which provides the Primary Care R&D Service across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland, has received a review of this research study via the Coordinated System for gaining NHS Permission (CSP) from the Clinical Research Network: East Midlands.
