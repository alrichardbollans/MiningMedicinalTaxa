The reliability of the method is remarkably dependent upon the timely recognition of all factors that may generate erroneus resuts once the validated method is applied in practice. Therefore the scientific approach in course of LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method development should involve risk analysis. The risk analysis denotes as-sessment of all critical steps (factors) that may affect the accuracy and ruggedness of the method. Matrix effect, me-tabolite interference, stability of the analyte and the selec-tion of an adequate regression model are identified as most common sources of method imprecision (Mulvana, 2010). Assessment of critical steps in bioanalytical method developmentMatrix effect (ME) is directly related to the sample clean-up procedure, thus selecting the optimal extraction procedure plays a crucial role for ensuring data quality in LC-MS/MS bioanalysis (Chambers et al., 2007). Different types of extraction procedures, depending on the analyte, exhibit different extraction recoveries and ME. Therefore testing out various extraction procedures should become inevitable part of the contemporary bioanalytical meth-od development. The implementation of Quality by de-sign, as a new trend, enables shortening the time needed for the optimization of the sample preparation procedure. Until recently, the optimal extraction procedure was cho-sen only upon the extraction recovery. However, consider-ing the LC-MS/MS analysis, the cleanliness of the extract, expressed through ME, obtained with different extraction procedures gains paramount importance. The EMA vali-dation guideline (EMA, 2011) recommends evaluation of the variability of the internal standard (IS)-normalized ME. However, it is more rational to assesses the degree of the absolute ME itself and not just the variability of the IS-nor-malized ME. This derives from the fact that the IS-normal-ized ME indicates that ME is consistent and not affected by the different lots of biological material. On the other hand, the absolute ME points out to the cleanliness of the ex-tracts (Nakov et al., 2015). Hence, it becomes evident that the selection of the sample preparation procedure should be based on the absolute ME and the extraction recovery should be put in second place, especially when problems related to the sensitivity of the method are not expected. The quantitative acceptance criteria applied in bioan-alytical validation guidelines (EMA, 2011; FDA, 2001) rely on data generated using quality control (QC) samples. However the QC samples do not contain phase I and II me-tabolites of the analyte of interest and therefore may be un-reliable model for real study samples. These metabolites are usually not stable and they can convert back to their parent drug in the mass spectrometer (in source back-con-version) and/or during sample preparation (in vitro back-conversion), jeopardizing the accuracy of the bioanalyti-cal method (Wenkui et al., 2011). Therefore the assessment of the possibility of metabolite back-conversion prior the method validation becomes a crucial part of risk analysis. The first step includes assessment of the in source back-conversion through the verification of the chromatographic separation between the analyte and its metabolite. This is especially important for high throughput LC-MS/MS anal-ysis, where chromatographic separation between the ana-lyte and the metabolite can be compromised, resulting in overestimated measurements. In case of this type of inter-S2 PP 64146Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 145 - 146 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsference, optimization/modification of the ion source pa-rameters and/or the chromatographic conditions should be applied. The metabolite back-conversion could also occur during the different steps of the sample preparation pro-cess, so second step involves investigation whether the proposed extraction procedure leads to metabolite back-conversion. For that purpose the optimized extraction pro-cedure should be applied on samples containing only the metabolite standard and the amount of analyte generated by metabolite back-conversion is then computed. In case of unavailability of metabolite standards, stability exper-iments under different storage conditions using real sam-ples could be applied as well (Jemal et al., 2010). The investigation of the sample stability in course of method development helps to avoid stability related prob-lems that may latter appear during the validation and appli-cation of the method. Although various sources may affect the sample stability, the focus within this paper is placed on chiral interconversion. All chiral compounds may undergo in vitro R/S conversion occurring at physiological pH and temperature or under extreme pH and elevated temperature (Briscoe and Hage, 2009). Therefore the assessment of the possibility of R/S interconversion during the overall ana-lytical procedure should be an integral part for every enan-tioselective method development, thus allowing quantifi-cation of the extent of in vivo interconversion without bias.The selection of an adequate regression model is the basis for accurate and reproducible quantification over the whole concentration range (Rozet et al., 2011). Most bio-analytical methods usually have wide concentration range, so heteroscedasticity of the data may be expected. In the above instance weighted linear or quadratic regression models should be applied. The recommendation of the reg-ulatory agencies (EMA, 2011; FDA 2001) is that the sim-plest model that adequately describes data should be used and the selection of more complex model should be jus-tified. Therefore the use of statistical approach based on non-parametric statistical tests (Nakov et al., 2014; Singto-roj et al., 2006) during the selection of the regression mod-el will provide justification of the choice of the adequate regression model, and will enable accurate quantification in whole calibration range.SummaryThe implementation of risk analysis during the LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method development is longer last-ing process compared to conventional method develop-ment. However the timely perceiving and assessment of the critical steps generates highly reliable bioanalytical methods and lowers the possibility of late discovery of un-expected problems than often lead to method re-optimiza-tion and revalidation.ReferencesBriscoe, C.J., Hage, D.S., 2009.

Macedonia* Hadzievam@yahoo.comIntroductionForced degradation studies provide data to support identification of possible degradants; degradation path-ways and intrinsic stability of the drug molecule and vali-dation of stability indicating analytical procedures (Singh and Bakshi, 2002). Although most of the literature de-fines the concept of forced degradation, they do not pro-vide detailed information about a forced degradation strat-egy (Klick et al., 2005) and the experimental conditions to conduct forced degradation are described in a general way (Singh and Bakshi, 2000) without description of the exact stress conditions to be applied. Generally, a trial and error approach is adopted to select the strength, temperature and time of exposure to achieve loss of active substance from 10-30% (ICH, 2003; Singh and Bakshi, 2000). Such approach involves consid-erable cost, time consumption and scientific expertise and there is high incidence of random results. Therefore a need for more systematic approach is recognized (Dolan, 2002).A contemporary approach in the field of forced degra-dation is to evaluate correlation of degradation parameters by applying the concept of design of experiment (DoE). In turn, this can help studying the combination of conditions where optimal enrichment of degradation products is ob-tained. The basic concept of factorial design is performing an experiment in which all the possible combinations of fac-tors and levels are investigated (Lundstedt et al., 1988).Literature review reveals the implementation of DoE and factorial design concepts for optimization of forced degradation conditions (Kurmi et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2013; Sonawane and Gide., 2011), but no report exists on application of DoE for simvastatin (SIM) as model drug.The aim of this study was to develop stability-indicat-ing LC-MS method for quantification of SIM and its im-purities, and also, an attempt was made to simplify forced degradation studies by adopting DoE concept.Materials and methodsSimvastatin (SIM) samples with Certificate of Suit-ability to the monographs of the European Pharmacopoia (CEP) were used. Simvastatin CRS and Simvastatin for peak identification were provided by the EDQM (Stras-bourg, France). All reagents used were of analytical grade.Experiments were made on Dionex UltiMate(tm) 3000 (Thermo Scientific), interfaced with mass spectrometer with an electrosparay-ionization source, operated in neg-ative mode. Mass parameters were optimized as follows: Ion source heater temperature was set at 350 degC; capillary temperature at 300 degC; capillary voltage was 10 V with collision energy 35 eV. The separation was performed on Poroshell 120 EC C18 (Agilent Technologies, USA), 50 x 3.0 mm, 2.7 mm, using buffer (10 mM ammonium format, pH 4.0) and acetonitrile as a mobile phase in a gradient mode. The column temperature was 40 degC. Flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. Injection volume was 5 mL. UV detection was performed at 238 nm. SIM was subjected to stress under acidic, alkaline, ox-idative, thermal and photolytic conditions. Variables, cho-sen from previously conducted initial experiments were: time of exposure, temperature and stressor strength. The forced degradation experiments set-up on the basis of 2n full factorial design were performed and the obtained re-sults from LC-MS samples were analyzed by Design Ex-S2 PP 65148Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 147 - 148 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationspert Software (Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA)."
