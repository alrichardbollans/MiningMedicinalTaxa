AN INTRODUCTION1.1 ! SCOPEUniversity courses in the United States that surveyuseful plants have been around for only a century orso. I suspect that the first class offered in the UnitedStates was at Harvard College in 1876. When I was anundergraduate, such courses were called \u201cEconomicBotany\u201d or \u201cEconomic Plants.\u201d When I joined thefaculty at Humboldt State in 1969, I was asked todevelop a course in Economic Botany. These titleswere rather simple and descriptive, or so theyseemed. Students were sometimes surprised todiscover that their professors were spending time onmore obscure food plants or discussing other plantswith little economic importance, such as arrowpoisons. The adjective \u201ceconomic\u201d could certainlysuggest that these plants would be those ofinternational commerce \u2013 the plants where significantsums of money could be made or lost.To address this problem, and frankly to come up withnames that had more sex appeal, colleges anduniversities now often use titles such as \u201cPlants andCivilization\u201d or \u201cEthnobotany.\u201d In both instances,however,  some confusion and controversy remains.The first suggests emphasis on more highlydeveloped, modern civilizations. Some definitions ofethnobotany restrict it to so-called primitive oraboriginal plant uses.Here is a sample of how various authors haveattempted to define these terms.Economic plants \"...  are those plants utilized eitherdirectly or indirectly for the benefit of Man. Indirectusage includes the needs of Man's livestock and themaintenance of the environment; the benefits may bedomestic, commercial, environmental, or aesthetic.\" (Wickens, 1990)Aboriginal botany is the study of \u201c... all forms of thevegetable world which the aborigines used formedicine, food, textile fabrics, ornamentals, etc.\u201d (Powers, 1874)Economic botany includes any area \"... where plantscience impinges on the economic life of man.... [It]is the simple study and description of economic plants,their culture, products, preparation, uses,occurrences, and distribution.\u201d  (Fosberg, 1948)\u201c... emphasizes the uses of plants, their potential forincorporation into another (usually Western) culture,and that their benefactors have indirect contact withthe plants through their by-products. In the botanicaltradition ethnobotany is subsidiary to economicbotany....\u201d (Ford, 1978)\u201c... usually concerns such subjects as the production,distribution and consumption of plants useful topeople... [It] is ... a subdivision of ethnobotany thatis involved when money becomes an importantconsideration.\u201d(Heiser, 1985)\u201c...the study of plants either useful or harmful topeople.\u201d (M. Balick, 1985)\"...  the study of the identification, properties, uses,and distribution of economic plants.\" (Wickens, 1990)\u201c... the study of human evaluation and manipulationof plant materials, substances, and phenomena,including relevant concepts, in primitive or unletteredsocieties.\u201d (Schultes & von Reis, 1995)Ethnobotany is the study of \"... plants used byprimitive and aboriginal people.\"(Attributed to Harshberger, 1895)\u201c... is concerned with the totality of the place of plantsin a culture and the direct interaction by the peoplewith the plants.\u201d (Ford, 1978)\u201c...\"the study of the direct interrelations betweenhuman populations and their botanical environment.\u201d (Ford, 1981)\u201c... the study of plants in relation to people.\u201d(Heiser, 1985)is the subdivision of economic botany that involves \u201c...the investigation of plants employed by peopleindigenous to a particular area.\u201d(M. Balick, 1985)\u201c... Today, the term denotes the entire realm of usefulrelationships between plants and man.\u201d (Manilal, 1988)\u201c...  the study of useful plants prior to theircommercial exploitation and eventual domestication....Unfortunately the term ethnobotany can still contain,especially to the laymen, a slightly derogatory flavour,the implication of racially inferior societies.\" (Wickens, 1990)\u201c...the study of the interactive relationships betweennonindustrial societies and their floral environment.\u201d(Lipp, 1995)\u201c... which concern the mutual relationship betweenplants and traditional peoples.\u201d (Cotton, 1996)\u201c... the study of the interactions of plants and people,including the influence of plants on human culture....The field of study that analyzes the results ofindigenous manipulation of plant materials togetherwith the cultural context in which the plants are used.\u201d(Balick & Cox, 1996)\u201cThe scientific study of the traditional classificationand uses of plants in different human societies.\u201d (Encarta World English Dictionary, 1999)RELATED FIELDS OF STUDYAbout a century ago, fields of study that had oncebeen subsumed under \u201cbotany\u201d were carved out asseparate disciplines and given their own names,particularly those aspects of botany that had applied,-1-practical applications. Unfortunately, what remainedas \u201cbotany\u201d then seemed very esoteric and remotefrom our everyday life.Because these fields deal with useful plants, they maybe seen as portions of the broader designation\u201cEconomic Botany.\u201d The second edition of the\"Random House Dictionary of the English Language\"offers the following definitions for related fields ofstudy:agriculture: the science, art, or occupationconcerned with cultivating land, raising crops, andfeeding, breeding, and raising livestock; farmingagronomy: the science of soil management and theproduction of field cropsforestry: the science of planting and taking care oftrees and forestshorticulture: the cultivation of a garden, orchard, ornursery; the cultivation of flowers, fruits, vegetables,or ornamental plantsHOW MANY USEFUL PLANTS?A good starting point might be to look at the numberof described species in each of the major groups ofplants and other organisms. In the older literature,algae and fungi were considered plants.Plants:Mosses/liverworts 16,500Fern relatives 1,300Ferns 10,000Gymnosperms 529Flowering plants (dicots) 170,000Flowering plants (monocots) 50,000Subtotal 248,329Others:Algae 26,900Fungi 47,000Bacteria 4,800Viruses 1,000Protozoa 30,800Insects 751,000Animals (all other) 281,000Total 1,390,829This summary suggests that botanists and zoologists have described about 1.4 million species. How manyundescribed ones are still out there? One estimate is5 million to 30 million, most of them insects!We have found some groups of the plant kingdom tobe rich sources of useful species, while others haveproven less so.' The vast majority of the plants that we haveexploited to date have been flowering plants. Thisis not too surprising since there are so many ofthem.' The conifers (gymnosperms) are the source of anumber of important timber trees and woodproducts.' The ferns and their relatives provide a few usefulplants.' We have found very few uses for mosses andliverworts.' There are a number of useful fungi and algae.Just how many economically important plants arethere?  Surprisingly, there are few estimates that havebeen published. The following is based on a recentcompilation (Wiersema & Le\u00f3n, 1999).Food (human) 1,049Food (additives) 382Food (animal: fodder) 269Food (animal: fForage) 466Bee Plants (honey) 134Medicinal 738Psychoactive (recreational) 39Gene sources 614Industrial 1,583Fuels 145Agroforestry 52Shade and shelter 188Toxic (vertebrates) 1,293Toxic (pesticides) 28Ornamentals 4,332Weeds 1,570Total 12,882HOW ARE THEY USED ?Several uses come immediately to mind, such asplants used for food, fiber for clothing, wood forconstruction, and a number of our medicines. But,there are many other uses that are perhaps lessobvious.

Air quality' Water quality' Soil maintenance' Climate' Food for wild animals' Habitat for wildlife and fishBASIC CONCEPTS OF PLANT USE' All animal life is dependent upon plants (directly orindirectly) because they convert solar energy tofood, replenish the oxygen supply, and provide thecaloric base for all food chains.' In addition to satisfying our basic needs for food,clothing, and shelter our interaction with plants hastouched almost every aspect of our life on earth.' We use only a few of the quarter of a million or soplant species that are potentially available.' We have found only one use for some plants, whileothers have several uses. A particular plant mayhave had several very different uses throughhistory.' Many plants are grown and used locally, and neverenter into international trade.' The vast majority of our economically importantplants are flowering plants, probably because oftheir number and relative commonness.-3-' Micro-organisms, especially bacteria and yeast,play critical roles even though we often fail toobserve their presence or activities.' The search for plants and our desire to control theirproduction and sale have been the cause of greatfeats of exploration, political intrigue, and wars.' The planting, tending, and processing of crops havebeen among our major preoccupations and wehave employed or have been willing to enslavemillions of our fellow humans to perform thesetasks.' While the plant kingdom is the source of aseemingly endless array of products, we appear tobe especially interested in starch, protein, sugar,alcohol, and alkaloids.' The process of \"trial and error\" has been critical indiscovering what is edible, toxic, medicinal, andpsychoactive.' The knowledge of indigenous peoples has oftenbeen an invaluable source of information aboutplant uses or it may be pure malarkey. The trick isto distinguish the two.' We have long believed (incorrectly anddangerously) that the general appearance of aplant provides us with clues as to its use, especiallyits curative powers.' Several of the most important families ofeconomically useful plants are easily recognizedand have been well-known for millennia.' Usefulness is a concept found in humans, pre-humans, and perhaps a few other animals. Someplants may never be useful to us. They are simplythere.1.2 ! SOME BASICTERMINOLOGY\u201cIt is a very sad thing that nowadays there is so littleuseless information.\u201d (Oscar Wilde)' ' ' ' 'Every field of endeavor has its own specializedvocabulary. Technical terms are required for exactnessand brevity. Consider the following set of directions onhow to harness a horse in Mark Twain\u2019s \u201cA TrampAbroad,\u201d in which he avoids the use of technicalterms.\u201cThe man stands up the horses on each side of thething that projects from the front end of the wagon,and then throws the tangled mess of gear on top ofthe horses, and passes the thing that goes forwardthrough a ring, and hauls it aft, and passes the otherthing through the other ring and hauls it aft on theother side of the other horse opposite to the first one,after crossing them and bringing the loose end back,and then buckles the other thing underneath thehorse, and takes another thing and wraps it aroundthe thing I spoke of before, and puts another thingover each horse\u2019s head, with broad flappers to it tokeep the dust out of his eyes, and puts the iron thingin his mouth for him to grit his teeth on, uphill, andbrings the ends of these things aft over his back, afterbuckling another one around his neck to hold his headup, and hitching another thing on a thing that goesover his shoulders to keep his head up when he isclimbing a hill, and then takes the slack of the thingwhich I mentioned a while ago, and fetches it aft andmakes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon, andhands the other things up to the driver to steer with.I have never buckled up a horse myself, but I do notthink we do it that way.\u201dBotany has an extensive vocabulary, much of itnecessary because we do not have sufficientlyaccurate terms in ordinary English to describe whatwe observe. Much of this terminology is concernedwith the details of classification, structure, andfunctioning of the plant body and it is of interest onlyto a specialist in these areas. I have attempted in thesummary below to review of some basic terms withspecial reference to economic plants. While it mayappear at times to be exhausting, it is by no anymeans exhaustive.GROWTH FORMThe following terms describe the general appearanceor habit of plants. Most plants will fit comfortably intoone of these categories, although some are clearlyintermediate.arborescent: tree-like, as in the bananas and palmsherbs: plants with non-woody aerial stems thattypically die back to the ground each yearherbaceous: having the features of an herb, a plantwith soft, usually featureless stems, with littledevelopment of bark or woodlianas: woody plants with elongate, flexible, non-self-supporting stemsshrubs: woody plants with more than one principalstemtrees: woody plant with a single main stem or trunk;some plants that we commonly call trees, such as thebanana, are arborescentvines: non-woody plant with elongate, flexible, non-self-supporting stemswoody: although not clearly differentiated from theherbaceous plant, a woody plant generally has a muchmore substantial stem system with well-developedbark and wood; the stem often has clearly identifiablesurface features, such as leaf scars, bud scale scars,and air pores (lenticels).DURATION (LIFE SPAN)annual: living for one year or lessbiennial: living for two years, often flowering andfruiting in the second yearperennial: living for three or more years, oftenflowering and fruiting each year-4-ROOTSRoots, generally speaking, comprise the sub-terraneanportion of a plant. It is convenient to recognize fourbasic kinds of roots:fibrous roots: many plants, particularly grasses,have a number of roots of about the same size,forming a dense complicated network. No single rootis obviously larger than the others. Except for theiruse in broom and brush making, fibrous roots are oflittle direct economic importance to us.tap roots: in many plants there is a single centrallylocated root that is dominant. Smaller roots branch offthis tap root. Common examples include the carrotand dandelion.tuberous roots: a tap root that becomes swollenwith food and water is often referred to as a tuberousroot. There is no sharp distinction between the taproot and tuberous root. The sweet potato is a commonexample.adventitious roots: any kind of root that arises froma site other than the true root system, as in the aerialroots and prop roots of maize.STEMSThe stem system is usually the above ground axis ofthe plant body. Stems bear leaves at a region calledthe node. The region between two successive nodesis called the internode. It is basically the nature ofthe stem system that determines the growth form ofa plant. Stems are subject to many modifications:rhizome: a horizontal stem at or below the surface.It is very often confused with a root, but it has nodesand internodes. It is often covered with scaly leaves.Rhizomes serve a propagative function. They may alsostore food.tuber: a thick, fleshy underground horizontal stem. Italso functions in food storage and reproduction.Tubers and tuberous roots are not the same thing.Common examples of the tuber are the Irish potatoand the Jerusalem artichoke.bulb: a vertical underground stem that is essentiallya bud. The edible portion of a bulb, the portion whichmakes up the bulk of the structure, is a series ofoverlapping leaves. Common examples are found inthe onion and tulip.corm: an upright, hard or fleshy underground stemsurrounded by dry, scaly leaves, as in the \"bulb\" of agladiolus.stolon or runner: an above-ground horizontal stemthat bears ordinary foliage leaves. Like the rhizome,it is useful in propagating the plant. Stolons are seenin the strawberry. They are of little direct economicimportance to us.LEAVESThe leaf is usually a flattened photosyntheticoutgrowth of the stem. It is composed of two basicparts, the blade and the petiole, the stalk thatsupports it. Often the petiole is mistakenly thought ofas a stem; the rhubarb \"stem\" is actually the petioleof the plant. The leaf blade may be undivided (simple) or dividedinto separate parts (compound). Each segment of acompound leaf blade is a leaflet. We often confuseleaves and leaflets, as in the children's poem aboutpoison oak and ivy, \"Leaves of three -- let it be!\"Those three \"leaves\" are the leaflets of a singlecompound leaf.A reduced leaf anywhere on a plant is often called abract.FLOWERSA flower is a stem that typically bears four series ofmodified leaves. The stem axis of the flower is thepedicel. The upper end of the pedicel to which thesemodified leaves are attached is the receptacle. Thecomponent parts of the four series are the sepals,petals, stamens, and carpels. The sepals areusually green. They are of little direct economicimportance. The petals are often brightly colored.They may contain aromatic oils that can be extracted.The stamen is composed of a spore-producing area(anther) and a supporting stalk (filament). Stamensare of no direct economic importance. The carpel isusually differentiated into a basal seed-bearing portion(ovary), a neck region (style) and a terminal areathat is receptive to pollen (stigma). Because thecarpels mature into the fruit of the plant, they are oftremendous economic importance.FRUITSA fruit is a ripened ovary, along with any other floralor vegetative parts that may be associated with it andthat mature at the same time. This botanical definitionapplies to a long list of what we refer to as fruits ineveryday life, but in many cases it does not. The\"seeds\" of the sunflower, corn, and carrot plants areactually seed-like fruits. And for some strange reason,we call certain fruits \"vegetables.\" Examples includesquash, beans, and the dreaded eggplant.STRUCTUREWhen we cut most fruits in cross-section, they revealthe following features:pericarp: the fruit wall, which may be fleshy, fibrous,woody, or bony at maturity. It consists of an outerlayer (exocarp), a middle layer (mesocarp), and aninner layer (endocarp). The three may be clearlydifferentiated from one another, as in the coconut withits woody exocarp, fibrous mesocarp, and bonyendocarp. In many of our common fruits, the skin orrind is the exocarp, while the mesocarp and endocarpare the fleshy portion and they are notdistinguishable. In the stone fruits (peaches, plums,etc.) the endocarp is the hard, bony layer thatcontains the seeds, the mesocarp is the fleshy edibleportion, and the exocarp is the skin. The structure ofsome fruits is very complex and easily misinterpreted.For instance, the skin of an apple and the rind of asquash are not the exocarp of these fruits. They arederived from the receptacle or floral tube (fused calyxand corolla).locule: the chambers within the fruit. The number oflocules is characteristic of a particular plant and variesfrom one to many.-5-ovules: the immature seedsplacenta: the region or line where the ovules areborne. Fruits of the grass family and the bean familyhave one, the mustard family have two, the lily andsquash familes have three.septum: an interior wall that divides the fruit into twoor more chambers (locules)DIFFERENTIATION OF THE FRUIT WALL (PERICARP)Plant Exocarp Mesocarp EndocarpCoconutDateGrapeTomatoAvocadoOrangeWoody shellSkinSkinSkinSkinRindFibers (coir)Sweet edible fleshSweet edible fleshEdible fleshEdible fleshSpongy layer below rindBony (= seed ?)Thin, bony (= seed ?)Not differentiatedNot differentiatedThin, bony (= seed ?)Fleshy, chambered interiorDEHISCENCEAt maturity, fruits are either dehiscent (opening bymeans of sutures, pores, or caps) or indehiscent (notopening by sutures, etc.), the seeds being released bythe rotting of the pericarp.FRUIT TYPESThe classification of fruit types is an unholy mess. Thefollowing scheme is a conservative one that is widelyused in general botany textbooks. You will note thattwo major subsets are recognized. True fruits arethose derived from a single flower, in which the ovaryhas a single carpel or two or more of them that arefused to one another. False fruits have been giventhat name because they are made up of true fruitsarranged in such a way that the whole structureappears to be a single fruit. Conjure up the image ofa raspberry or a strawberry. Each of the small, juicyparts of a raspberry is a true fruit; each of the littleseed-like structures embedded on the surface of thestrawberry is a true fruit. These are commonexamples of false fruits derived from the separatecarpels of a single flower. In other words, it I placedfive strawberries or five raspberries in front of you,each would have come from a different flower. Thereare also false fruits that result from the fusion of fruitsfrom separate flowers. Examples include thepineapple, breadfruit, and fig. More about them whenwe get to tropical and subtropical fruits.AN OUTLINE OF FRUIT TYPESTrue fruits (dry when mature):1-seeded; not splitting open at maturity:achene: fruit wall and seed separatecaryopsis (grain): fruit wall and seed fusednut: outer fruit wall hardschizocarp: fruit separates into series of intactsegments2- to many-seeded; splitting at maturity:capsule: a \"pod\" that opens by slits, pores, or anapical lidsilique: splits lengthwise to reveal central, paperypartitionlegume: 1-chambered, splitting along two seams(sutures)follicle: 1-chambered, splitting along only one seam(suture)True fruits (fleshy when mature):drupe: fruit with outer skin, pulpy flesh, and one hardseed berry: fruit with outer skin and a fleshy interiorpepo: a type of berry with leathery rind as outer layerof fruit wallpome: fruit surrounded by fleshy stem tissue atmaturityhesperidium: fruit with sections lined with juicybladders False fruits (derived from a single flower):accessory: seed-like fruits on surface of rounded,expanded stem aggregate: formed from numerous dry or fleshyindividual fruitship: fruit vase-like, containing several seed-like fruits(achenes)False fruits (derived from a flower cluster):multiple:derived from fusion of fruits of manyseparate flowerssyconium: vase-like fruit with flowers lining interiorwallSEEDSMost plants reproduce by means of structures calledseeds. Flowering plants, conifers, ferns, and fernrelatives are collectively known as \u201cseed plants\u201dbecause they possess them. Mosses, fungi, and algaedo not. A seed is a mature ovule. It consists of (1) anembryonic plant, (2) stored nutritive material that willtide the plant over until it can germinate and matureto the stage where it can photosynthesize, and (3) anouter protective layer known as the seed coat. It issometimes thin and papery; sometimes hard andbony.Seeds tend to be higher in proteins, fats, and oils thanthe vegetative parts of the plant. These are often ofgreat economic importance.Sometimes a seed is more or less covered by a paperyto fleshy tissue called an aril, as in ackee (a tropicalfruit) and mace (a spice).POLLINATION AND REPRODUCTION-6-Pollination is the transfer of pollen from an anther toa stigma. It is not synonymous with fertilization, theunion of egg and sperm in plants and animals thatreproduce sexually. Pollen grains may be transferredwithin the same flower (self-pollination) or from oneflower to another (cross-pollination). Many speciesof plants have evolved temporal, structural, orphysiological mechanisms to insure self-pollination orcross-pollination. In addition, we have imposedartificial conditions in many of our economicallyimportant plants to make certain that pollination doesnot occur or that it comes about in very preciselycontrolled ways. For instance, we remove the tasselsfrom maize plants to prevent self-pollination. We mayalso exclude pollinators from particular areas.Pollen tubes, carrying sperm cells, will grow throughthe style and into the locules of the ovary. Eventuallythey will penetrate the immature seed (ovule),discharge the male gametes, one of which will fusewith the egg nucleus to form a fertilized egg orzygote. In the flowering plants, another male gametewill fuse with other nuclei within the ovule to initiatethe formation of endosperm, a protective andnutritive tissue. Much or all of the endosperm may beused by the developing embryo. It may also bepresent in mature seeds, in which case we mayconsume it. Some kinds of endosperm are starchy;others have high oil content.Sexual reproduction, which involves the union of eggand sperm nuclei, is not the only mechanism availableto plants. Many species, including some of our mostimportant economic ones, reproduce asexually orvegetatively. The essential part that must be used forvegetative propagation is stem tissue. Cuttings, slips,and grafts all consist of a section of stem, with at leastone bud. Recall that a bud is a much condensed sideshoot that will produce a lateral stem with its ownleaves, flowers, or both. We are able to propagate theIrish potato by planting its \"eyes\" because they arebuds. If we were to plant a portion of the skin orstarchy interior of the potato, it would not grow into anew plant.In nature, the various kinds of modified stems(rhizomes, stolons, bulbs, corms, and tubers) serve asmeans of vegetative reproduction, in addition to beingstorage organs for the plants. When rhizomes orstolons break apart, each segment is capable ofgrowing into a new adult plant. Keep this in mindwhen you gleefully attack some weed that bearsrhizomes or stolons. Each part that gets left behind ordropped somewhere in the yard can become a newplant. The central or lateral buds can also develop intoindependent daughter plants.The products of asexual reproduction will begenetically identical to the parent plants. Theparticular combination of characteristics (food value,fiber content, oil content, taste, color, medicinalproperties, etc.) will be faithfully reproduced,generation after generation. Therefore, it is notsurprising to learn that many of our most importantcrops are vegetatively propagated. We do not plantthe seeds of potatoes, bananas, sugar cane, orpineapple to get a new crop. All are the products ofasexual reproduction. In fact, a few of our crop plantshave not flowered or set seed in hundreds or eventhousands of years. We maintain them in a strictlyvegetative state.I should also point out that we are not talking aboutan \"either/or\" situation. Many plants, under naturalconditions or in cultivation, may reproduce sexually byforming flowers, fruits, and seeds and they may alsoreproduce asexually by forming rhizomes, bulbs, etc.We purposefully keep some plants that are perfectlycapable of sexual reproduction in a vegetative state.For instance, we frustrate the poor pineapple bykeeping the required pollinators away from them.One final complication. You might well assume that ifyou see fruits on a plant that they must be the resultof sexual reproduction. After all, a fruit is the ripenedovary of a flower. However, in plants such as thenavel orange and the banana, fruit formation isinitiated by the act of pollination. No union of gametesoccurred and no seeds were formed. Parthenocarpyis the condition of fruits developing without seeds. Notall seedless fruits are parthenocarpic. Some of theseedless grapes are entirely fertile. They lack seedsbecause of a failure of their embryos to develop.Of course, you might suspect that something kinkymight be going on in seedless fruits. But, if there areseeds in that fruit, then fertilization must haveoccurred ... right? Wrong! To muddy the waters evenfurther, some plants have seeds that develop from anunfertilized egg or even from vegetative cells.CHROMOSOME NUMBERS AND SETSIn general, all living plant cells contain nuclei with aspecific number of chromosomes. Their number, whichvaries from 1 to 1000+, appearance, and behaviorprovide important information in determining theclassification and evolutionary history of plants. Whenyou see a chromosome number cited in a text, thatcount is based upon an examination of nuclei takeneither from vegetative cells or from reproductive cells.In most higher plants, the nucleus in each cell of root,stem, or leaf tissue typically contains two completesets of chromosomes. The total number of pairedchromosomes in each of these vegetative cells isvariously referred to as its somatic or sporophyticchromosome number. On the other hand, thespecialized sex cells, the egg and sperm nuclei,typically contain only one complete set ofchromosomes. When we make reference to theirnumber of chromosomes, we are talking about thegametic chromosome number of a plant. If thenumber appears in terms of 2n, as in \"2n = 14,\" it isa somatic chromosome number. If it appears in termsof n, as in \"n = 4,\" it is a gametic chromosomenumber.One complete set of chromosomes is called agenome. It is often referred to by a letter, as in the\"B\" genome of wheat or the \"A\" genome of thebanana. A nucleus with a single genome is said to behaploid; a nucleus with two genomes is said to bediploid. Another situation, fairly common in plants,but rare in animals, is that of having more than twocomplete sets of chromosomes present in a nucleus.This condition is called polyploidy and plants in whichit occurs are called polyploids. Many of our mostimportant economic plants are polyploids. It may bea triploid with three sets of chromosomes, atetraploid with four sets, a pentaploid with fivesets, a hexaploid with six sets, etc. Plants with aneven number of chromosome sets are more commonthan those with an odd number. Whereas \"n\" and \"2n\"are used to tell the gametic and sporophyticchromosome numbers, respectively, x is used to tellthe number of chromosome sets (genomes) present ina plant. For example, if a plant is a triploid, it is 3x.When you read that the common breadwheat is 6x =42, the author is telling you that the nuclei contain six-7-genomes or sets, totaling 42 chromosomes. Eachbasic set (genome) is composed of sevenchromosomes (x = 7).Here are the somatic chromosome numbers (2n) fora series of economic plants:Banana: 3x = 33Coffee: 2x = 22; 4x = 44Coca: 4x = 24Cotton: 2x = 26; 4x = 52Marijuana: 2x = 20Wheat: 2x = 14; 4x = 28; 6x = 42Rice: 2x = 24A FEW GEOGRAPHICAL TERMSThe following terms are frequently encountered in theliterature of economic botany:Old World: the continents of Europe, Asia, and AfricaNew World: the continents of North, Central, andSouth AmericaOceania: the islands of the central and south Pacific.i. e. Polynesia, Micronesia, Melanesia, Australia, andNew Zealandtropics: the regions lying between the Tropic ofCancer and the Tropic of Capricorn (from 23.5E northlatitude to 23.5E south latitude)subtropics: bordering on the tropics; nearly tropicaltemperate: the region of the earth's surface lyingbetween each of the tropics and the nearest poleA FEW TERMS RELATING TO TIMEAD: Anno Domini, Latin for \"in the year of Our Lord,\"not \"After Death,\" as commonly believedBC: Before ChristBCE: Before the Christian, Current, or Common EraBP: Before Present (with present defined as 1950)Bronze Age: a cultural period in Old World humanpre-history characterized by the use of bronze intools, weapons, and ornaments.

The \"English system\" is just asaccurate as the metric system, but it is more difficultto understand and to use. A pint of a dry material isnot the same volume as one pint of a liquid. Weexpress weight using three different systems -- troy,apothecaries, or avoirdupois -- depending on what weare weighing. etc.Here are a few useful equivalencies:1 millimeter = 0.04 inches1 centimeter = 0.39 inches1 meter = 1.09 yards1 hectare = 2.47 acres1 gram = 0.035 ounces1 kilogram = 2.20 pounds1 metric ton = 1.10 short ton1 liter = 1.06 quartsThree quick and dirty approximations:1 gram = weight of 1 regular paperclip1 milligram = weight of 1 grain of salt1 mm = thickness of 1 dimeAnd, your thought for the day is,  \"If God had wantedus to use the metric system, He would have given usten fingers!\"1.3 ! THE NAMES OFPLANTS\u201cOrder is heaven\u2019s first law.\u201d (Alexander Pope)\"Yesterday I cut an orchid, for my buttonhole.... In athoughtless moment I asked one of the gardenerswhat it was called. He told me it was a fine specimenof Robinsoniana, or something dreadful of that kind.It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of givinglovely names to things. Names are everything.\"  (Oscar Wilde, \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\")\u201cThere should be some things we don\u2019t name, just sowe can sit around all day and wonder what they are.\u201d(George Carlin)' ' ' ' 'Plants often have two names -- a common name usedby most of us in everyday circumstances when weneed to make reference to a plant growing in the yardor something that we might wish to purchase at themarket. They also have scientific names or Latinnames, as they are sometimes called, used bybotanists, agronomists, and by the \"serious\" amateur,etc. In this course, I will be using both commonnames and scientific names. You will not berequired to learn the scientific names of anyplants and you may use acceptable commonnames on the examinations. Many of you will,however, begin using the scientific names more andmore as the term goes along.-8-COMMON NAMESADVANTAGES. It would be foolish for me to maintainthat common names have no value. They are the onlynames known to most of us. These names are oftensimple, easy to remember, descriptive, colorful,pleasing to the ear, and easy to pronounce. Given thisimpressive list of advantages, why do we not simplyuse common names for plants and be done with it?DISADVANTAGES. There are several reasons whybotanists and other scientists do not use commonnames:' A plant may have more than one common name.The broad-leaved plantain, a common lawn weed,has almost fifty other common names in Englishalone. In California and Oregon, one of ourcommon trees is called bay, bay leaf, Californiabay, myrtle, myrtlewood, pepperwood, andOregon myrtle.' The same common name may be used for morethan one plant. Laurel is a common name appliedto trees in five different plant families. We allknow what corn is. You may be surprised to learnthat in other English-speaking countries, theircorn is what we call wheat.' Many common names are confusing. A pineappleis not a kind of pine, nor is it an apple. Kentuckybluegrass is not blue, nor is it native to Kentucky.Names such as \"welcome home husband, nomatter how drunk ye be,\" \"kiss me over thegarden gate,\" \"spotted arsemart,\" and \"rampingfumitory\" certainly make it difficult to maintainthat common names have brevity and clarity ofmeaning.' Because there are no universally accepted rulesfor giving common names to plants, we cannotsay that one is the correct common name. Thereare certainly instances in which this becomescritical. If you pay $1000 for an ornamental treeat a nursery or take a particular herbal remedy,you want to be very sure of what you are getting.' Common names do not provide an indication ofclose relationship among the plants that share thename. Sour-grass, arrow-grass, blue-eyed grass,grass (marijuana), and China-grass are not kindsof grasses, nor are they related to one another.' Probably the most serious difficulty is that mostplants do not have common names. We have usedonly a small portion of the half million or so kindsof plants to the extent that common names havebeen applied to them. This is a problem forauthors of field guides, for consultants who writeenvironmental impact statements, and for staffmembers in various state and federal agencieswho must prepare material for generalconsumption. Authors have attempted tocompensate for this lack of common names byinventing them, usually by translating thescientific name into English. The advantage of\"Milo Baker's cryptantha\" over Cryptanthamilobakeri is not immediately apparent to me.SCIENTIFIC NAMESADVANTAGES. Although scientific names may causeyou some discomfort, their advantages to the botanistare compelling.' There is a single, universally recognized name foreach plant. Because they are used by botanists allover the world, scientific names facilitate the freetransfer of ideas and information. Consider thedifficulties that would arise if the botanists in theUnited States, England, Germany, Russia, China,etc. each had their own independent set of namesfor the plants of their countries.' The same scientific name may not be used formore than one kind of plant. Once it has beenpublished, that name cannot be used again forany other plant.' Scientific names are given according to an\"International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.\"These regulations are reviewed at InternationalBotanical Congresses. ' Inherent in our system of scientific names is theconcept of evolutionary or genetic relationship.When we name the white potato, eggplant, andblack nightshade Solanum tuberosum, Solanummelongena,  and Solanum nigrum, respectively,we are indicating that these three plants belong tothe same genus, Solanum, and that they arerelated to one another. Because there is a set ofbotanical features associated with the name, ithas predictive value. If you know a plant belongsto the genus Quercus, the true oaks, you canpredict all kinds of things about it. You can betgood money that it will be a tree or shrub withleaves of a certain shape, and that it will have thefamiliar acorn as its fruit type.DISADVANTAGES. There are some difficulties withscientific names.' They can be difficult to pronounce, especially ifyou did not learn to divide words into syllablesearly on in your education. You might note,however, that such familiar and easily pronouncedcommon names as aster, rhododendron,magnolia, chrysanthemum, petunia, and begoniaare also the first part of the scientific names ofthese plants. My own experience in teachingundergraduates to use scientific names is thatonce you can get past the psychological barrierthat these are terribly long words that only thosewho have had a strong background in Latin andGreek can pronounce, then you will become muchmore comfortable with them and begin using themrather easily.' One of the most frustrating features of scientificnames, especially for someone who is justlearning about them, is that they are changedfrom time to time. Just when you have learnedthe scientific names for a particular group ofplants, someone will publish a new revision of thegroup and you discover that some of the nameshave been changed. These changes come aboutfor several reasons. As new information about theanatomy, chemistry, and genetics of plantsbecomes known, it may cause botanists to rethinkthe evolutionary relationships among the plantsbeing studied. These changes may require us torevise the scientific names to reflect the new levelof information now available to us. Sometimesnames are changed, not for biological reasons, butbecause someone studying a group may discoverthat the name given to a particular plant has to berejected because it violated some provision of theInternational Code of Botanical Nomenclature.-9-Both of these examples point out one of theimportant operating principles in plantclassification. As new information becomesavailable and as errors are discovered, we makeadjustments and corrections. What appears to bea fine scheme of classification today may bemodified drastically or even discarded completelyat some point in the future.THE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTSThe branch of the biological sciences that deals withthe classification of organisms is taxonomy  orsystematics. The purpose of this discipline is tocreate a system of classification that best reflects ourknowledge of the similarities and differences inorganisms. In the strictest sense, the classification ofplants involves placing them in a series of categoriesthat have been arranged to show relationships to oneanother. The names and sequence of these categoriesare set by the International Code of BotanicalNomenclature. When these groupings are so arrayed,they constitute the taxonomic hierarchy, the list ofcategories into which plants are classified. Theprincipal levels of the taxonomic hierarchy and theirstandard endings, when applicable, are:division (or phylum): -phytaclass: -opsidaorder: -alesfamily: -aceaegenus: no single endingspecific epithet: no single endingPLANT FAMILY NAMESI will usually refer to a plant family by its commonname and its technical one. While all of the families ofvascular plants have the standard \"-aceae\" ending,eight of them have equally correct alternative names.They constitute the only exceptions to the rule that atany level in the taxonomic hierarchy, each plant canhave only one correct name. They are permittedbecause these families are so well known to us byvirtue of their abundance and usefulness that theywere named long before our requirement ofstandardized endings was adopted. I use the oldernames; they were the first to be published. The eightfamilies with two equally correct names are: FAMILY EQUIVALENCIESFirst Published Family Name AlternativeCompositae (Sunflower family) AsteraceaeCruciferae (Mustard family) BrassicaceaeGramineae (Grass family) PoaceaeGuttiferae (Garcinia family) ClusiaceaeLabiatae (Mint family) LamiaceaeLeguminosae (Legume family) FabaceaePalmae (Palm family) ArecaceaeUmbelliferae (Carrot family) ApiaceaeLet me put your mind at ease. You will not be askedto learn the technical family names of any plants.COMPONENTS OF SCIENTIFIC NAMESIf we examine the botanical works of the 15th and16th centuries, we see that the name of a plant wasoften a lengthy series of descriptive words, typically inLatin, as in \"Convolvulus argentateus foliis ovatisdivisis basi truncatis: laciniis intermediis duplolongioribus.\" These phrase names or polynomialsbecame increasingly awkward because the discoveryof a new kind of plant required that the existingpolynomial be slightly modified so that it could bedistinguished from the older one.A new way of naming plants was developed over fourcenturies ago to replace the polynomials. It waspopularized in the 17th century by Carolus Linnaeus,the leading botanist of his time. This system wasbased upon the principle that each plant (or animal forthat matter, because they are named according to thesame scheme) is given a scientific name that consistsof two components, both of them parts of thetaxonomic hierarchy mentioned above. The firstelement of the scientific name is the genus (orgeneric name), as in Triticum, the genus of wheat.The plural of genus is genera, not genuses. Thesecond element is the specific epithet, as inaestivum, the particular kind of wheat called breadwheat. This second element of the scientific name isoften incorrectly called the \"species.\" It is the genusand specific epithet together that form the speciesname. Triticum aestivum is the species name of breadwheat. Because the name of a plant or animal is thecombination of these two words, the scientific name iscalled a binomial and we call this scheme of givingtechnical names to organisms the Binomial Systemof Nomenclature.The binomial, for reasons of completeness andaccuracy, is followed by the name (typicallyabbreviated) of the person or persons who firstpublished that name for the plant. For example, in thescientific name Zea mays L., the \"L.\" stands forLinnaeus.It is sometimes necessary to transfer the name of aplant from one genus to another, usually becausemore recent research has demonstrated that the plantwas incorrectly assigned to a particular genus. Forinstance, Linnaeus called the tomato Solanumesculentum. Several years later, Philip Millerdetermined that the tomato should be in the genusLycopersicon, to separate it from the nightshades ofthe genus Solanum. The scientific name of the tomatobecomes Lycopersicon esculentum (L.) Miller. Theperson whose name is in the parentheses firstpublished the specific epithet for the plant. The nameafter the parentheses is that of the person whotransferred it into the genus where it now resides.It is often useful to recognize variation within aspecies. The two most widely used are thesubspecies (abbreviated ssp.) and the variety(abbreviated var.). These names also haveauthorities, as in Cannabis sativa L. ssp. indica(Lamarck) E. Small & Cronquist. If the subspecies orvarietal name is a repeat of the specific epithet, thenthe authority is not repeated, as in Zea mays L. ssp.mays.Since we are focusing our attention on plants ofeconomic importance, an additional explanation isneeded for the term variety. For reasons that areobvious, we have developed many different cultivatedstrains of a particular crop plant or ornamental. Thereare literally thousands of different kinds of rice. Thereare probably hundreds of different kinds of tuberousbegonias. In general parlance, we often call thesevarieties. However, for purposes of formalnomenclature, these variations are considered toominor and often too short-lived to warrant giving them-10-a scientific name. The variety of botanicalnomenclature is not used in these instances. Instead,we employ the term cultivar (cultivated variety). It isabbreviated cv. The \"Martha Washington\" geranium istechnically known as Pelargonium hortense cv. 'MarthaWashington.'Many of our economic plants are hybrids that resultfrom the accidental or purposeful crossing of twoclosely related species or cultivars. This can bereflected in the scientific name of the hybrid byinserting an \"x.\"  If the x occurs before the genericname, then the plant is considered the result of across between two plants in different genera, as in XTriticale, a hybrid between wheat (Triticum) and rye(Secale).If the x occurs between the generic name and thespecific epithet, then the plant is the product of across between two species in the same genus, as inthe banana, Musa x paradisiaca. It is result of a crossbetween Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana.WRITING SCIENTIFIC NAMESThere are a few simple rules that must be followed inwriting scientific names.' The genus is always capitalized.' The specific epithet should not be capitalized. Therules allow them to be if they are commemorative,as in Elymus Smithii (a relative, no doubt) or if theepithet was once a generic name itself, as in AcerNegundo, the box-elder. Even in such instances,however, the rules discourage capitalization.' The generic name and specific epithet areunderlined when they appear in handwritten ortyped material. They are put in italics or bold-facein printed text.' The authority is always capitalized, but it is notunderlined or otherwise set off from the remainderof the text.THE ORIGIN OF SCIENTIFIC NAMESMost of the words that make up scientific names arederived from Latin or Greek, although there is norequirement that they must be. Modern names andeven nonsensical ones have been used. Manystudents, however, believe that there must be somerequirement that scientific names be as long andunpronounceable as possible. This reveals a certainlack of scholarship. Even a rudimentary knowledge ofetymology is very helpful in understanding thecomposition of scientific names. The followingexamples may be helpful.Commemorative NamesBlighia William Bligh, Captain of the BountyCarnegia Andrew Carnegie, American industrialistnuttallii Thomas Nuttall, English botanistmenziesii Archibald Menzies, surgeon/naturalistClassical/aboriginal NamesAgrostis Greek name for grassFagus Latin name for the beech treemays Indian name for corn or maizecepa Latin name for the onionGeographical Namesanglicus of or pertaining to Englandgallicus of or pertaining to Francecanadensis of or pertaining to Canadasinensis of or pertaining to ChinaGrowth Formarboreus treerepens creepingscandens climbingHabitatarenarius growing in sandcampestris of the fieldsfluviatilis of the riverssativus cultivatedStructural featurePenstemon having 5 stamensSanguinaria having a red sapamabilis lovely in appearancefoetidus foul-smellingtuberosus having a swollen partUseesculentus edibleofficinalis recognized as medically importantsomniferum sleep inducingtextilis having useful fibersPRONUNCIATIONThe International Code of Botanical Nomenclaturestates that scientific names of plants are to be treatedas Latin words, regardless of their origin. A few of themore scholastically inclined botanists will argue,therefore, that we ought to pronounce scientificnames according to the strict rules of the sounds ofvowels and consonants in Latin and that great careshould be taken in accenting the proper syllable. But,there are several versions of Latin to choose from,each with its own set of rules for pronunciation.Most American botanists pronounce the scientificnames of plants as though they were English words.Some of us follow the rules in Latin for determiningwhich syllable is accented; most of us do not. Many ofus pronounce scientific names the way we were taughtas undergraduates (if any formal discussion occurred)or more commonly we imitate the way our professorssaid them when we took their classes. These becomethe familiar and \"correct\" way to pronounce thescientific names of plants.A Quick and Dirty Guide to Pronunciation' Pronounce each syllable.' Say them as you would in English.' Put the accent where you think it ought to be.' Try to be consistent.A More Scholarly Approach The following is an attempt to present a basic guideto pronouncing vowels, consonants, and diphthongs,together with some of the rules for accenting-11-syllables.' The letters of the Latin alphabet are the sameas ours, except that J, U, and W did not occurin the classical version.' Each syllable will contain a vowel or a doublevowel combination (ae, au, ei, oe, or ui). Thelatter are called diphthongs.' Pronounce all of the syllables. Ribes is \"r\u00ee-bees,\" not \"r\u00eebs.\"' Final vowels are long, with the exception of a.If a word ends in two vowels (unless they area diphthong), they are sounded separately.The epithet quinquefolia is pronounced \"kwin-kwe-fo-li-ah.\"' The diphthongs \"ae\" and \"oe\" have the sound\"e,\" as in the word beat; \"au\" has the sound of\"aw,\" as in awful; \"ei\" usually has the sound\"i,\" as in  site; \"eu\" has the sound of \"u,\" as inneuter; and \"ui\" has the ui-sound in the wordruin.' The \"oi\" in the ending \"-oides\" is treated as adiphthong by most American botanists and wegive it the sound that \"oi\" has in the word oil. Thishabit is considered close to barbaric by Englishand Europeans who are much more persnicketyabout such matters. Because these two vowels donot form a diphthong, they should be pronouncedseparately, so that the ending \"-oides\" has thesound \"-o-e-deez.\"' A single consonant is placed with the followingvowel, as in \"pa-ter.\"  Double consonants areseparated, as in \"am-mi.\" If there are two ormore consonants, the first one is usually put withthe preceding vowel, as in \"an-gli-cus.\"' The letters B, d, f, h, l, m, n, p, qu, and z arepronounced the same in Latin and English.' The consonants c and g are soft (that is, have thesounds of \"s\" and \"j\") if they are followed by ae,e, i, oe, or y. Otherwise, the c is pronounced likea \"k\" and the g is also hard, as in \"go.\" The s isalways pronounced as it is in the word \"so,\" notas a \"z.\" An initial x is pronounced as a \"z,\" not\"ek-z.\" Xanthium is \"zan-thi-um,\" not \"ek-zan-thi-um.\"' The first letter is silent in words beginning withcn, ct, gn, mn, pn, ps, pt, and tm.' Accenting the proper syllable can be tricky.Sometimes the author of a flora or other manualmay provide assistance by including an accentmark. Most do not. If included, they are for theconvenience of the reader and they are not part ofthe scientific name itself. If you must determinewhich syllable to accent, the following rules maybe helpful. Words of two syllables are alwaysaccented on the first syllable. In words of three ormore syllables, the last syllable is never accented.The stress will fall either on the next to the lastsyllable (the penultimate syllable), as in \"ar-ven-sis,\" or on the third from the last syllable(antepenultimate), as in \"an-gli-cus.\"  No matterhow long the word, the accent can never be to theleft of the antepenultimate syllable. Decidingbetween these two options is a difficult choice.Accent the penultimate syllable if it ends in aconsonant, diphthong, or in a long vowel.' Commemorative names (patronyms) present aspecial problem because giving them the properaccenting can render the person's nameunrecognizable. The epithet jamesii is pronounced\"ja-me-se-i,\" not \"james-e-i.\"  Most of us in theUnited States ignore this rule.THE CODE FOR CULTIVATED PLANTSThe naming of cultivated plants is governed by its ownset of rules, the International Code of Nomenclaturefor Cultivated Plants. The following articles arepertinent:Article 1. Cultivated plants are essential to civilization.It is important, therefore, that a precise, stable, andinternationally accepted system should be available fortheir naming.Article 7. Cultivated plants are named at three mainlevels: genus, species, and cultivar (variety).Article 10. The international term \"cultivar\" denotes anassemblage of cultivated plants which is clearlydistinguished by any characters (morphological,physiological, cytological, chemical, or others), andwhich, when reproduced (sexually or asexually),retains its distinguishing characteristics. The term isderived from cultivated variety. Note 2. The conceptof cultivar is essentially different from the concept ofbotanical variety, varietas. The latter... are always inLatin form and are governed by the Botanical Code.Note 4. The terms cultivar and variety (in the sense ofthe cultivated variety) are exact equivalents.Article 29. A cultivar name, when immediatelyfollowing a botanical or common name, must bedistinguished clearly from the latter, either by placingthe abbreviation cv. before the cultivar name, or bysome typographical device, preferably by enclosing itwithin single quotation marks. It should not be printedin italics.-12-1.4 ! CHRONICLE OFECONOMIC BOTANYThe purpose of this compilation is to identify the datesof various critical discoveries, events, voyages,inventions, publications, etc. that relate toeconomically important plants. I begin by setting thestage, so to speak, with cosmological considerations --the formation of the universe, solar system, and ourplanet. The next several entries relate to theappearance of life on the earth, beginning about 4billion years ago. The evolution of our immediateancestors began about 4 million years ago, with thefirst true human beings appearing in Africaapproximately 1.5 million years ago. Our use of plantsbegins at about that point, with such discoveries asfire-making, the building of shelters, and the cosmeticuse of dyes. About 150,000 years ago we beganincorporating flowers into ritual burials; there is someevidence that 60,000 years ago we started usingvarious herbs because of their medicinal properties.Farming of cultivated plants began about 16,000 yearsago; the domestication of various plants and animalsapproximately 10,000 years ago. Most of ourimportant crop plants were domesticated over thenext few thousand years. Only a handful of plantshave been domesticated in the last two millennia.In about A. D. 800, Irish voyagers reached Iceland,beginning an age of exploration that would last for athousand years. Among the many notableaccomplishments of Marco Polo, ChristopherColumbus, James Cook, and others was a dramaticincrease in our knowledge of the natural history of ourplanet and the exchange of plants and plant productsaround the globe. As the sixteenth century came to aclose, newly developed instruments and techniques inthe fields of botany and chemistry formed the basis ofour modern understanding of the plant kingdom. Thiswas followed by the appearance of a series ofinventions designed to extract various products fromplants and to process them.The nineteenth century saw the refinement ofchemical extraction procedures that allowed us toisolate and purify a number of economically importantmaterials, especially certain alkaloids with medicinaland psychoactive properties.In the twentieth century, we have witnessed thegrowth of giant industries based upon the supplying ofa long list of plant products to the consumer. It was alittle over a hundred years ago that the field ofgenetics was founded with the investigations ofStrasburger and von Beneden into the mechanisms ofmitosis and meiosis. For the last several decades, wehave developed the techniques needed to control thegenetic heritage of many of our most important cropsand to create entirely new ones in our laboratories.Our studies have also shown how dangerous plantproducts such as alcohol, tobacco, and the opiates canbe; how destructive to the natural environment ourconversion of land for the growing of crops can be;and how we have become increasingly dependentupon a relatively short list of genetically-impoverishedplants.DATE EVENT, DISCOVERY, ETC.Years Ago: 13,500,000,000 The \"Primordial Explosion\" or \"The Big Bang\"12,500,000,000 Galaxies form6,000,000,000 Sun forms 5,000,000,000 Solar system forms 4,500,000,000 Earth forms 4,000,000,000 Beginning of life on Earth (bluegreen algae) 1,600,000,000 Multicellular plant life evolves425,000,000 Terrestrial plant life evolves395,000,000 Insects evolve380,000,000 Ferns evolve350,000,000 Gymnosperms (cone-bearing plants) evolve216,000,000 Mammals evolve200,000,000 Continental drift begins123,000,000 Flowering plants evolve69,000,000 Primates evolve67,000,000 Extinction of the dinosaurs24,000,000 Grasses evolve14,000,000 Ramapithecus, oldest human-like primate, evolves in Africa and India11,000,000 Grazing animals evolve7,000,000 Sahelanthropus tchadensis (\u201cToumai man\u201d) oldest hominid species, evolves in Africa4,400,000 Ardipithecus ramidus  evolves in Africa4,000,000 Australopithecus afarensis (\"Lucy\") evolves in Africa3,700,000 Modern horses evolve3,200,000 Large ice sheets build up over northern continents2,400,000 Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) begins2,400,000 Hominids in Africa make first stone tools2,000,000 Australopithecus boisei and A. robustus evolve1,900,000 Homo habilis (\"Handy Man\") evolves in Africa; first hand axes1,800,000 First stone dwellings (Tanzania)1,600,000 Apes and prehumans use red ochre as a cosmetic1,500,000 Homo erectus, first true human, emerges in Africa1,400,000 Discovery of fire (Kenya)1,000,000 Homo erectus migrates through the Old World tropics-13-800,000 Homo erectus populates temperate zones; makes shelters from branches420,000 First huts (France); first fishermen (France)200,000 Homo sapiens (\"Thinking Man\") evolves200,000 Artistic hand axes appear150,000 Neanderthal Man emerges in Paleolithic Europe; ritual burials there and in Far East127,000 Last glaciation and associated warming period79,000 Oil-burning lamps made of stone in use60,000 Earliest evidence of herbal medicine50,000 Humans first populate Australia45,000 Music and oral literature developed (Asia)35,000 Modern humans evolve in Europe35,000 Oldest written records35,000 Asian hunters cross Bering Strait35,000 Cro-Magnons appear; Neanderthals decline32,000 Flute, first known musical instrument, invented30,000 Human settlements in Mexico27,000 Cave art (France); ceramics and sculpture (Czechoslovakia)27,000 First humans colonize Japan21,000 Sewing needle invented18,000 Bow and arrow invented (Europe)18,000 Laurentide and Scandinavian ice sheets attain their greatest extent16,000 Mesolithic begins16,000 Farming of cultivated plants begins15,000 Ropes invented (France)13,000 Grinding stones for grain developed (Egypt)11,000 Pottery developed (Japan)11,000 Bottle gourd domesticated (Africa ?)10,000 Dog domesticated (Iraq/Palestine)10,000 World population reaches 3 millionB.

TWENTY-FIVEIMPORTANT FAMILIESThere are various ways of surveying useful plants. Iwill use the structure found in most textbooks on thesubject -- arrange the plants according to how we usethem, as opposed to some botanical scheme. Whilethis makes good sense, it obscures the fact that someplant families are economically more important thanothers. Which plant families are high in useful plants?Here is one analysis.FAMILIES WITH 25+ USEFUL PLANTSPlant Family Taxa %*01 Grass (Gramineae) 359 15.602 Legume (Leguminosae) 323 29.703 Rose (Rosaceae) 154 36.404 Nightshade (Solanaceae) 100 40.705 Sunflower (Compositae) 75 44.006 Myrtle (Myrtaceae) 73 47.207 Mallow (Malvaceae) 67 50.108 Mint (Labiatae) 55 52.509 Squash (Cucurbitaceae) 46 54.510 Mustard (Cruciferae) 43 56.411 Rue (Rutaceae) 43 58.212 Spurge (Euphorbiacecae) 41 60.013 Carrot (Umbelliferae) 38 61.714 Ginger (Zingiberaceae) 32 63.115 Palm (Palmae) 30 64.416 Goosefoot (Chenopodiaceae) 30 65.717 Yam (Dioscoreaceae) 29 67.018 Century Plant (Agavaceae) 25 68.0* The percentages shown are cumulative. In other words, thefirst 10 families contain 56.4% of all of the useful plantstallied by the authors. Data from Zeven & Zhukovsky (1975).A PLANT FAMILY SURVEYI have selected 25 plant families to summarize below.My choice is more subjective than I had originallyintended. Even if someone had tallied the number ofeconomic plants per family, I would argue that afamily that contains fifty plants of minor economicimportance should not rank higher than, for instance,Cannabaceae, which contains only marijuana andhops.Each of the descriptions below gives you the technicaland common name of the plant family, the number ofgenera and species it contains, a brief statement as toits distribution, the typical growth form (herbs, trees,etc.), the typical number of flower parts, the fruittype, a list of economically important species, andtheir use(s).

PLANT KINGDOMRECORDSI began constructing this section several years agobecause  these kinds of questions were often asked.What is the biggest, smallest, oldest, most expensive..., etc. Some of what follows is found in the GuinnessBook of World Records;  much of it comes from a widevariety of newspaper articles and more obscuresources.Oldest plant: King's holly (Lomatia tasmanica), amember of the protea family growing in southernAustralia, is estimated to be 43,000 years old.Oldest tree: bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) inCalifornia is estimated to be 4700 years old. Somereferences cite the \"Eon\" tree, a redwood growing inHumboldt County, California, as 6200 years old.Tallest living tree: The \"stratosphere giant,\" aredwood (Sequoia sempervirens) in HumboldtRedwoods State Park is 112.3 m (368.6 ft.) tall, asdetermined by Dr. Stephen C. Sillett, a botanist atHumboldt State University.Tallest tree ever measured: \"Ferguson tree\"(Eucalyptus regnans) in Australia was 470-480 ft. tall.Tree with the largest canopy: the Great Banyan(Ficus benghalensis), growing at the Indian BotanicalGarden in Calcutta, has 1775 prop roots and coversabout three acres.Most massive organism (plant or animal):\"Pando\" aspen clone in the Wasatch Mtns. of Utah. Its47,000 trunks cover 106 acres and weigh anestimated 13 million pounds.Plant with greatest coverage: The honeymushroom (Armillaria ostoyae), growing in theMalheur National Forest in Oregon, covers about 2000acres or 3.5 sq. miles. It is estimated to be 2400years old.Most massive living tree: \"General Sherman,\" aSierra redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum) inSequoia Natl. Park in California. At 274 ft. tall, 36.5 ft.in diameter, 82.3 ft. in circumference, and weighingan estimated 4.5 million pounds, this tree may be thelargest single organism that has ever lived on ourplanet, exceeding by far the size of any knowndinosaur or whale. It would yield 600,120 board feetof lumber.Most massive tree ever measured: The \u201cLindseyCreek\u201d redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), with anestimated weight of 8 million lbs. It was downed by astorm in 1905.Tree with the lightest wood: Aeschynomenehispida, a South American legume, has wood with aspecific gravity of 0.044. A cubic foot weighs only 2.75lbs.Tree with the heaviest wood: ironwood (Olealaurifolia), an African relative of the olive tree. With aspecific gravity of 1.49, one cubic foot weighs 93 lbs.Largest yield of cork bark from a single tree. Asingle tree produced enough cork for 100,000 bottlesof wine. The average yield is closer to 4000 corks.Fastest growing plant: Chaparral yucca (Yuccawhipplei). It grew 12 ft. in 14 days.Largest simple leaf: elephant ear (Alocasiamacrorrhiza), a member of the philodendron or aroidfamily growing in Malaysia. One leaf was measured at9 ft. 11 in. long by 6 ft. 3 in. wide.Largest compound leaf: raffia palm (Raphiafarinifera), from tropical Africa, has leaves with a 13ft. petiole and a 65 ft. long blade.Largest flower cluster: Puya raimondii, a memberof the pineapple or bromeliad family, that grows onlyin Peru and Bolivia. The inflorescence was 35 ft. tall.Plants flower after 80-150 years, which may also besome kind of record.

DOMESTICATION2.1 - AN OVERVIEW' We have domesticated plants and they, in asense, have domesticated us.' In many cultures, if you cultivate plants, you arecivilized; if you do not, you are a savage.' Agriculture is a relatively recent invention; for90% of the time that we have been on earth, wehave been hunter-gatherers.' There are a few regions, most of them in the OldWorld, where domestication began.' Only a few plants (coconut, bottle gourd, sweetpotato) were in use in both the Old World and inthe New World in Pre-Columbian times.' Today most crop plants are not growncommercially where they are native.' We have modified plants to meet our needs, withlittle regard to the biological consequences to theplants themselves.' The wild ancestors of several of our mostimportant crops are now extinct.' The destruction of wild populations of ancestralforms is endangering the genetic viability of anumber of our crop plants.' The domesticated forms of some of our mostimportant crops are now incapable of livingwithout our assistance.' Many of our crops are reproduced asexually.' Asexual reproduction means genetic stability;sexual reproduction means variation. Therein liesthe great paradox -- in homogeneity liesproductivity; in diversity lies survival.' The natural crossing of plants in closely relatedspecies or genera has been an important processin the origin and evolution of many of our crops.' Many of our crop plants have three or morecomplete sets of chromosomes in each nucleus,while their wild ancestors typically had only twosets.' The domestication of plants is intimatelyassociated with the rise of great civilizations.' There have been three great revolutions:agriculture, the Green Revolution, andbiotechnology (genetic engineering).' We are losing plant species, possible sources offood and cures, at an ever increasing rate.2.2 ! DOMESTICATION\u201cAgriculture is the first of all arts. Without it therewould exist neither merchants nor poets norphilosophers.\u201d  [Frederick the Great]\u201c... the offspring of the ancient marriage of plants andpeople are far stranger and more marvelous than werealize.\u201d [Michael Pollan, \u201cThe Botany of Desire\u201d]\u201cEconomic botany is a necessity for human survivalbut a potential hazard to the survival of Nature.\u201d[G. Kunkel]\u201cOne day a little band of these odd apes \u2013 for apesthey were \u2013 shambled out upon the grass: the humanstory had begun. Apes were to become men, in theinscrutable wisdom of nature, because flowers hadproduced seeds and fruits in such tremendousquantities that a new and totally different store ofenergy had become available in concentrated form.The great Ice Age herds were destined to vanish.When they did so, [a] hand ... would pluck a handfulof grass seed and hold it contemplatively.In that moment, the golden towers of man, hisswarming millions, his turning wheels, the vastlearning of his libraries, would glimmer dimly there inthe ancestor of wheat, a few seeds in a muddy hand.Without the gift of flowers and the infinite diversity oftheir fruits, man and bird, if they had continued toexist at all, would be today unrecognizable.Archaeopteryx, the lizard-bird, might still be snappingat beetles on a sequoia limb; man might still be anocturnal insectivore gnawing a roach in the dark. Theweight of a petal has changed the face of the worldand made it ours.\u201d[Loren Eiseley, \u201cThe Immense Journey\u2019]' ' ' ' 'We have lived on Earth in a recognizably distinct formfor about 2 million years. For the vast majority of thattime, we have hunted beasts, gathered roots andfruits of various kinds, and eaten wild grasses. Of theestimated 80 billion \"cultural people\" who have livedon our planet, about 90% have been hunters andgatherers.Please refer to the \"Chronicle of Economic Botany\"earlier in the syllabus. You will note that it was about14 million years ago when the first human-likeprimate evolved and that it was about 3-4 millionyears ago that our closest relatives (Australopithecusspp.) came on the scene. It was only about 250,000years ago that we began to make standardized tools. But the monumental event that is often called thesingle most significant occurrence in human culturalevolution happened a scant 10,000 years ago. Thatevent is the cultivation and domestication of plantsand animals.To emphasize how recent this was in the scheme ofthings, I will switch time scales. Assume that theentire history of the universe can be collapsed into asingle year.HISTORY IN A SINGLE YEARJanuary 01 Creation of the UniverseSeptember 25 Origin of life on earthDecember 20 Plants colonize the landDecember 28 First flowering plants appearDecember 31 (10:30 p.m.) First humansDecember 31 (11:00 p.m.) Use of toolsDecember 31 (11:59 p.m.) Agriculture-34-In other words, this monumental event (or process)that has so changed the way we live on this planetoccurred one minute before midnight on the very lastday of the \"Cosmic Year.\"THE PROCESS OF DOMESTICATION\u201cDomestication is a biological process that invokeschanges in the genotype and physical characteristicsof plants and animals as they become dependent uponhumans for reproductive success.\u201d [Price & Gebauer, 1995]What do we mean by cultivation and domestication ofplants and what are the processes involved? Tocultivate means to care for a plant; to till the soil,water, weed, and prune. To domesticate means tobring into the household and in so doing, to alter itfrom its wild state. We have domesticated a hundredor so plants and 50 or so animals, such as the dog,pig, cattle, horse, water buffalo, goat, sheep, andchicken.Domestication is really directed evolution, which inturn is based upon two basic phenomena: variation,the concept that not all individuals are the same andthat some are better adapted for survival than others,and natural selection, the view that nature selectsfor those individuals that are best adapted toreproduce the species. When it comes to our cropplants, natural selection has been largely replaced byartificial selection -- by people consciously andunconsciously selecting those individuals that we wantto preserve.Domestication involves three important steps:(1) moving seeds, tubers, etc. from their nativehabitats and planting them in new areas;(2) removing selective pressures and therebyallowing more variants to survive; and (3) selecting for characteristics that are useful to us,but not necessarily for the plant under its naturalconditions.CHANGES BROUGHT ABOUT BYDOMESTICATIONSome changes in plants that have occurred as a resultof domestication include:Ecological:' spread into a greater diversity of environmentsand a wider geographic rangeLife History/Reproduction:' flowering and fruiting simultaneously;' reduction or loss of dispersal mechanisms;' conversion from perennials to annuals;' absence of normal pollinators;' loss of defense mechanisms (thorns, spines, etc.);' development of seedless fruits;' reproduction by vegetative means;' change in chromosome number;' increased susceptibility to disease;' loss of seed dormancy;' loss of photoperiod controls;' change from cross- to self-pollination;' conversion of flower partsSize of Plants/Plant Parts:' Increase (as in maize and potato)' Decrease (as in dwarf wheats)Chemical Constituents:' Increase (as in % of corn oil, THC, etc.)' Decrease (as in % of nicotine, HCN, etc.)Aesthetics:' Palatability' Uniformity' Color and textureWHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG?The overriding question about the domestication ofplants is why did it take so long for us to make sosimple a \"discovery\" or to take this step. A number oftheories have been put forth:' While we lived by hunting, fishing, and gatheringwe had too little time for such cultural luxuries.' Domestication became a necessity after dramaticshifts in climate.' For thousands of years, we would be satisfied justto meet our basic needs for food, shelter, andclothing. Domestication occurred as theculmination of an ever increasing differentiationand specialization of human communities.' Some plants and animals may have beendomesticated as parts of religious ceremonies.' No particular motive or advance was required;only the revelation that seeds can be sown toproduce plants when and where desired (\"TheEureka! Model\").' There is no single explanation; all of them havecontributed to our understanding of the problem(\"The No-Model Model\").IDENTIFYING THE ANCESTORSThere are two schools of thought, each championed bya giant figure in this field. ALPHONSE DE CANDOLLE (1806-1893) was amember of a distinguished family of Swiss botanists.In his two great works (\"G\u00e9ographie BotaniqueRaisonn\u00e9e,\" 1885 and \"Origine des Plantes Cultiv\u00e9es,\"1882) he attempted to demonstrate that the differentkinds of cultivated plants that we now see could betraced back to wild ancestors that were still with usand recognizable as their wild progenitors. DeCandolle determined that there were 247 ancestralspecies: 199 in the Old World, 45 in the New World, 7now extinct, and 3 whose origin was uncertain.The following concluding remarks from his \"Origin ofCultivated Plants\" provide an excellent summary of histhinking:\"Cultivated plants do not belong to any particularcategory, for they belong to fifty-one differentfamilies. They are, however, all phanerogamous[flowering plants] except the mushroom.... Thecharacters which have most varied in cultivation are,beginning with the most variable: a. The size, form,and colour of the fleshy parts...; b. The number ofseeds, which is often in inverse ratio to thedevelopment of the fleshy parts of the plant; c. Theform, size, or pubescence [hairiness] of the floralorgans which persist round the fruits or seeds; d. The-35-rapidity of the phenomena of vegetation -- whenceoften results the quality of ligneous [woody] orherbaceous plants, and of perennial, biennial, orannual.\"\"The classification of varieties made by agriculturistsand gardeners are generally based on thosecharacters which vary most (form, size, colour, tasteof the fleshy parts, beard in the ears of corn, etc.).Botanists are mistaken when they follow this example;they should consult those more fixed characters of theorgans for the sake of which the species are notcultivated.\"\"No distinctive character is known between anaturalized plant which arose several generations backfrom a cultivated plant, and a wild plant sprung fromplants which have always been wild.\"\"A species may have had, previous to cultivation, arestricted habitation, and subsequently occupy animmense area as a cultivated and sometimes anaturalized plant.\"\"In the history of cultivated plants, I have noticed notrace of communication between the peoples of theold and new worlds before the discovery of America byColumbus.... Between America and Asia twotransports of useful plants perhaps took place, the oneby man (the Batata, or sweet potato) the other by theagency of man or of the sea (the cocoa-nut palm).\"CHARLES ROBERT DARWIN (1809-1882) isprobably best known for his great work, \u201cThe Origin ofSpecies by Means of Natural Selection.\u201d Another of hismost important contributions to the field of naturalhistory is \"The Variation of Animals and Plants underDomestication.\" In these quotes from the secondedition, you will see that Darwin took a very differentapproach to the problem.\"The subject is involved in much difficulty. Botanistshave generally neglected cultivated varieties, asbeneath their notice. In several cases the wildprototype is unknown or doubtfully known; and inother cases it is hardly possible to distinguish betweenescaped seedling and truly wild plants, so that thereis no safe standard of comparison by which to judgeof any supposed amount of change. Not a fewbotanists believe that several of our ancientlycultivated plants have become so profoundly modifiedthat it is not possible now to recognise their aboriginalparent-forms.\"\"... M. De Candolle concludes that plants have rarelybeen so much modified by culture that they cannot beidentified with their wild prototypes. But on this view,considering that savages probably would not havechosen rare plants for cultivation, that useful plantsare generally conspicuous, and that they could nothave been the inhabitants of deserts or of remote andrecently discovered islands, it appears strange to methat so many of our cultivated plants should still beunknown or only doubtfully known in the wild state. If,on the other hand, many of these plants have beenprofoundly modified by culture, the difficultydisappears. The difficulty would also be removed ifthey have been exterminated during the progress ofcivilisation; but M. De Candolle has shown that thisprobably has seldom occurred.\"\"From innumerable experiments made through direnecessity by the savages of every land, with theresults handed down by tradition, the nutritious,stimulating, and medicinal properties of the mostunpromising plants were probably first discovered....We probably owe our knowledge of the uses of almostall plants to man having originally existed in abarbarous state, and having been often compelled bysevere want to try as food almost everything which hecould chew and swallow.\"WHEN DID IT OCCUR?The answer is reasonably straightforward \u2013 at varioustimes in different places around the world. Thequestion also implies that domestication is a pastevent. We continue to guide the evolution of plantsand animals around us.DOMESTICATED PLANTSB. C. E.

We donot know in what region first appeared in their wildform wheat, barley, oats and rye.\"Habitat. Since that time, a variety of habitats havebeen suggested, including (1) arid hillsides ormountainous regions; (2) grasslands; (3) edges offorests; (4) rubbish heaps; (5) stream terraces; and(6) edges of lakes and rivers.Geography. In attempting to locate the geographicregion where domestication arose, attention was firstdirected to locations in the Old World. Fossil remains,although scanty, were there. The earliest come frompresent-day Iraq and Iran, from sites in the ZagrosMountains. The fossils have been dated at 8000 B. C.E. They consist of grinding stones, obsidian tools,bones of domesticated sheep and goats, and a fewgrains of two kinds of domesticated wheat and one ofdomesticated barley. Three or four thousand yearslater, a second major center of domesticationappeared in China or Southeast Asia. The people ofthat region first domesticated a small-grained cerealcalled millet. Rice and the soybean came later.In the New World, studies have centered onMesoamerica and South America, especially sites inMexico and Peru. The great Indian civilizations ofthese areas were based upon the domestication ofmaize, squashes, beans, quinoa, and the potato.CENTERS OF ORIGINNickolay Ivanovich Vavilov (1887-1943) was oneof the leading investigators of the origin of cultivatedplants. He held several high positions in the Sovietscientific establishment, including President of theLenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Directorof the Institute of Plant Industry. Vavilov was incharge of over 400 research units and experimentstations in the U. S. S. R. from 1921 to 1934. Heengaged in extensive field work in Afghanistan,Ethiopia, China, Central America, and South America.It was the detailed knowledge from this vast amountof field work that formed the basis of many of histheories.Much of Vavilov\u2019s work on the origin of cultivatedplants is summarized in \"Phytogeographic Basis ofPlant Breeding\" (1951). Vavilov recognized eightindependent areas that are now variously referred toas centers of origin or as centers of diversity. Thetwo concepts are not the same, although the termsare often used interchangeably. These centers areseparated from one another by extensive deserts ormountain ranges that acted as barriers to themovement of plants and primitive peoples. Taken asa whole, the eight areas occupy only 1/40th of theland surface of the earth.Vavilov's early work, resulting in his designating theseeight centers of origin, rests on the premise that theplace of origin of a particular kind of cultivated plantis that area where we encounter the greatest numberof genetic varieties or strains of that plant. This ideawas not original with Vavilov, but he did much tosubstantiate it by collecting tremendous amounts ofdata on his numerous expeditions. At first, theconcept was widely accepted. In recent years,however, Vavilov's work has come under increasingcriticism. Vavilov himself recognized the validity of some ofthese criticisms and made certain basic changes in histheories. Probably the major improvement in histheories involves recognizing that what he called\"centers of origin\" should have been called \"centers ofdiversity.\" The Abyssinian Center of Vavilov containsmany plants that had their origins elsewhere. Cropssuch as wheats, barleys, peas, flax, and lentils havegreat diversity there, but their sites of origin may wellbe in the Middle East. None of the wild counterparts ofthese plants occurs in Ethiopia. This presents a seriousproblem, unless we accept the idea that domesticatedplants arise de novo. In an attempt to answer thiscriticism, Vavilov distinguished between \"primarycenters\" where domestication began and \"secondarycenters\" where cultivated plants may be found afterthe initial domestication.A summary of Vavilov's eight centers, their geographicdelimitations, and their most important plant speciesis presented below.I. The Chinese Center. This is the largest center oforigin. It covers the mountainous regions of centraland western China and the adjacent lowlands. 136species, including the peach, apricot, cherry, walnut,kumquat, loquat, persimmon, litchi, water chestnut,taro, soybean, rhubarb, eggplant (now you can seethis hideous creature in its true light -- a communistplot against all right-thinking citizens!), cucumber,broomcorn millet, tea, mulberry, paper mulberry,opium poppy, ginseng, sesame seeds, tung nut oil,China berry, cassia, ramie, and hemp.II. The Indian Center. This center includes Burmaand Assam, but it excludes northwest India, thePunjab, and the northwestern frontier region. 117species, including many peas and beans, mango,orange, jack fruit, betel nut, chaulmoogra oil tree,rice, sorghum, madder, Indian rubber tree, yam,henna, madder, black pepper, cardamon, cumin,cinnamon, coconut, safflower, black mustard, gumArabic, and sandalwood.-37-IIa.

The Abyssinian Center. This center includesEthiopia and Eritrea. It is limited in both size and inthe number of endemic species. 38 species, includingteff, raggi, pearl millet, fenugreek, cow pea, hyacinthbean, castor bean, khat, coffee, okra, myrrh, andindigo.VII. South American & C. American Center. Inaddition to southern Mexico and Central America, thiscenter also includes the Antilles. 49 species, includingthe prickly pear, soursop, sapodilla, three kinds ofsapote, papaya, avocado, guava, star apple, cashew,yam bean, sweet potato, arrowroot, chayote, agave,cherry tomato, cacao, annatto, tobacco, lima bean,tepary bean, upland cotton, sisal, henequen, maize,and various peppers.VIII. The South American Center. This centerincludes Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. Many of theendemic plants occur in the high mountains. Theregion is characterized by unusual potatoes and othertuber-bearing plants. 45 species, including potatoes,oka, nasturtium, tomato, tree tomato, ground cherry,pumpkin, peppers, marigold, coca, passion flowers,quinoa, Egyptian cotton, quinine, and tobacco.VIIIa. The Chiloe Center. This is the smallest centerof origin, a small island off southern Chile. 4 species,including the white potato and wild strawberry.VIIIb. The Brazilian-Paraguayan Center. Althoughrich in wild plants, this center is poor in its number ofcultivated species. 13 species, including manioc,peanut, cacao, the rubber tree, Paraguay tea,pineapple, Brazil nut, and cashew.NUMERICAL SUMMARY OF CENTERSCenter Number ofSpecies% of TotalChineseIndianCentral AsiaNear EastMediterraneanAbyssinianMesoamericanS.

Only 111are New World plants. About 80% of the Old Worldplants had their origin in southern Asia. Themountains and tropical regions of Asia are the homeof many plants that we use today. Second, there aremajor continental areas that are particularly poor inmajor endemic cultivated plants. They are NorthAmerica, Europe, Africa, and Australia. This is not tosay that these areas are devoid of cultivated plantsthat played some role in the ethnobotanicaldevelopment of peoples. It is just that they areimpoverished in major cultivated plants. Can youname, for instance, a major crop plant that is nativeto the United States?VAVILOV AND LYSENKOAs Vavilov\u2019s fame grew around the world, he foundhimself the target of scientific and political opposition,especially from one of his staff members, an ambitiouscharlatan named Trofim D. Lysenko. He claimed thatchromosomes did not exist and that the field ofgenetics was just some silly notion of a Catholic monk(Mendel). His bizarre ideas of crop breeding includedthe belief that one species of plant could betransformed into another in a matter of months.Unfortunately for Soviet agriculture in general, and forVavilov in particular, Lysenko had a very powerfulpatron -- none other than Josef Stalin himself.Lysenko finally decided that his position was strongenough to bring down Vavilov, who was accused ofbeing a British spy, accepting the concepts of westernscientists, and rejecting those of Soviet workers,including Lysenko. Vavilov was arrested, tried, andsentenced to death. He was put in one of the infamousSiberian labor camps. He became a \u201cnon-person.\u201d Oneof the 20th century\u2019s most distinguished scientistssimply failed to exist. The circumstances surroundingVavilov's death remained unclear for many years. Nowwe know that he died in 1943 of starvation and heartdisease.Lysenko became a dominant figure in Sovietagriculture, which accounts, at least in part, for decades of food shortages as the collective farms wereforced to adopt his scientifically discreditedprocedures. Lysenko fell from grace when NikitaKhrushchev was ousted. A few years later, the Sovietgovernment not only acknowledged that Vavilov hadexisted, but it restored his reputation and accordedhim great honors.TIMELINE: N. I.

They include:' comparison of wild and cultivated living forms;' fossil remains, in the form of:! charred (carbonized) material;! impressions;! silica skeletons;! water-logged material;! desiccated or mummified grains;! frozen material;! petrified material;' art work with botanical illustrations' references to plant use in ancient texts; and' linguistic studies.We are now able to combine these lines of evidencewith genetic data (DNA comparisons) and chemicaldata from living plants to produce a more completepicture of the ancestors of our modern domesticatedplants. This has led to other more recentinterpretations of centers of diversity, as seen below.RECENT VIEWS OF CENTERS OFDIVERSITYZhukovsky

diversity are richin species, while others are less so. Which are in thelatter category? Consider the array of plants that weuse in this country today. Where are they native?WAS DOMESTICATION A MISTAKE?Let\u2019s end this topic by pointing out that not everyoneis convinced that the domestication of plants andanimals has been such a fine thing. How is it possibleto hold such a position? Are we not better off nowthan the people in the Middle Ages? The cavemen?The apes? Jared Diamond (1987) argues thefollowing:' We are now much more dependent upon a few highcarbohydrate crops, such as rice and the potato.' We are more susceptible to famine and crop failure.' Studies show an increase in tooth enamel defectsassociated with malnutrition, an increase in iron-deficiency anemia, an increase in bone lesions, anduntil recently a decrease in life expectancy.' The population densities that are now possible withagriculture encourage the spread of parasites andinfectious disease.' Agriculture led to deep class divisions andaccentuated the inequality of the sexes.ORIGIN VERSUS PRODUCTION ?As we move through our review of useful plants, youwill notice an interesting pattern. The places aroundthe world where we now grow these plants is typicallyfar removed from their ancestral home. At first, thismay seem to make little sense. Here are somereasons why we grow the crops where we do:' Better growing conditions;' Competition from weeds, pests, and diseases;' Availability of land;' Cost, supply, and efficiency of labor;' Availability of capital;' Existence and proximity of markets;' Economic/governmental stability;' Government subsidies;' Industrial subsidies;' Role of botanical gardens, experiment stations,etc.;' Role of an individual (botanist, politician,monarch, etc.) in identifying a region.-43-2.3 ! WEEDS:OUR COMPANIONS\u201cWhat is a weed? A plant whose virtues have not yetbeen discovered.\u201d (Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1878)\u201cA weed is more than a flower in disguise.\u201d(James Russell Lowell)A weeds is \u201c... a plant which has an innate dispositionto get into the wrong place.\u201d (Celia Thaxter, 1894)\u201c... a weed is a plant out of place.\u201d(Willis Blatchley, 1912)Weeds are \u201cwild plants that interfere with humanobjectives.\u201d (Ellstrand, et al., 1999)\u201c... the history of weeds is the history of Man.\u201d (Edgar Anderson)' ' ' ' 'It might strike you as a little peculiar that a discussionof economically important plants would include weeds.They are of great economic importance, mostly in thenegative sense. It is estimated that weeds cost theAmerican farmer several billion dollars each year byreducing both the amount and quality of cropsproduced. Their damage causes a loss as large asinsect injury and disease combined. Another reasonfor studying weeds is their intimate association withour own species. Many of them are essentially ourwards and they would perish without ourencouragement.There are many definitions of a weed. Inherent inmost of them is the idea that a plant is a weed if it isgrowing where we do not wish it to be. The picture ofa well-manicured lawn dotted with dandelions comeseasily to mind. There are problems with this approach.If I am growing irises, then a rose that appears in mygarden is a weed. Bermuda grass is a highly prizedlawn grass in much of the southern United States.Elsewhere it tends to live in disturbed areas. IsBermuda grass a weed?A good botanical definition of a weed is that of the lateHerbert Baker, a botanist at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley. A plant is a weed, \"... if, in anyspecified geographical area, its populations growentirely or predominately in situations markedlydisturbed by man (without, of course, beingdeliberately cultivated plants).\" Remember thatdisturbed sites include not only relatively undesirablevacant lots and roadsides, but also our primeagricultural lands. Some weeds invade one or theother; some live in both.Weeds are such a problem in the agricultural statesthat there is legislation against them. Many stateshave weed laws that require the farmer to use varyingdegrees of control against weedy plants. The \"primarynoxious weeds\" are considered so bad that the landowner is required to destroy them if he discoversthem on his property.THE SYNDROME OF WEEDINESSThere are certain biological features that many weedyplants have. These include:' persistence  from year to year in an area;' ability to reproduce vegetatively, thereby allowingplants to spread quickly and efficiently;' ability to germinate in many differentenvironments;' producing flowers early in its life cycle;' long-lived seed;' high seed production;' setting  seed in a wide variety of conditions;' rapid seedling growth;' having a \"general purpose\" set of genes that willenable plants to compete very effectively againstnative plants when they are competing ondisturbed sites;' self-pollination or some other asexual means ofreproduction;' if cross-pollinated, then by wind or someunspecialized insect visitor; and' being unpalatable or even toxic to livestock orherbivores.Can we say anything positive about weeds? Yes,indeed. In ruined and abandoned areas, weeds makeup much of the flora. Many of the more attractiveplants that city folks see these days are weeds. Theyalso retard or prevent erosion along many of ourroadsides.Why have I linked this subject to domestication?SOME OF OUR COMMON WEEDS*Aster Aster pilosusBarnyard grass Echinochloa crus-galliBedstraw (cleavers) Galium aparineBeggar\u2019s ticks Bidens spp.Bind weed, field Convolvulus arvensisBind weed, hedge Calystegia sepiumBindweed, black Polygonum convolvulusBlack berry Rubus allegheniensisBlack medic Medicago lupulinaBlue grass, annual Poa annuaBouncing bet Saponaria officinalisBox elder Acer negundoBur cucumber Sicyos angulatusBurdock Arctium minusButter weed Packera glabellaButtercup, small-flowered Ranunculus abortivusButterprint (velvet leaf) Abutilon theophrastiCarolina cranesbill Geranium carolinianumCheat grasses (chesses) Brtomus spp.Cherry, black Prunus serotinaChickweed Stellaria media-44-Chicory Cichorium intybusCinquefoil Potentilla rectaClovers, Japanese Kummerowia spp.Cocklebur Xanthium strumariumConfederate daisy Helianthus porteriCrab grasses Digitaria spp.Daisy Chrysanthemum leucanthemumDandelion Taraxacum officinaleDay flower Commelina communisDay lily Hemerocallis fulvaDock, curly Rumex crispusDodder Cuscuta pentagonaElderberry Sambucus canadensisEvening-primrose Oenothera biennisFalse nut sedge Cyperus strigosusFireweed Erechtites hieracifoliaFleabane Conyza canadensisFleabane Erigeron annuusFoxtail grasses Setaria spp.Gama grass Tripsacum dactyloidesGarlics Allium spp.Goldenrod Solidago canadensisGoosefoots Chenopodium spp.Gout weed Aegopodium podagrariaGrape, frost Vitis vulpinaGround-cherry Physalis philadelphicaGround-ivy Glechoma hederaceaHenbit (dead nettle) Lamium amplexicauleHoney vine Cynanchum laeveHoneysuckle, Japanese Lonicera japonicaHorse-nettle Solanum carolinenseIndian hemp Apocynum cannabinumIndian-tobacco Lobelia inflataIronweed Vernonia giganteaJimson weed Datura stramoniumJohnson grass Sorghum halepenseKnotweed Polygonum aviculareMexican tea Chenopodium ambrosioidesMilkweed Asclepias syriacaMock-strawberry Duchesnia indicaMoonseed Menispermum canadenseMorning glories Ipomaea spp.Mulberry, white Morus albaMulleins Verbascum spp.Nightshade, black Solanum nigrumPepper-grass Lepidium campestrePigweeds Amaranthus spp.Pineapple weed Matricaria discoideaPipe vine Aristolochia tomentosaPlantains Plantago spp.Poison ivy Toxicodendron radicansPoke weed Phytolacca americanaPrickly lettuce Lactuca serriolaPrickly sida Sida spinosaPrivet Ligustrum vulgarePurslane Portulaca oleraceaQuack grass Elymus repensQueen Anne\u2019s lace Daucus carotaQuick weed Galinsoga quadriradiataRagweeds Ambrosia spp.Rose, multiflora Rosa multifloraRye grass Lolium perenneSassafras Sassafras albidumSelf-heal Prunella vulgarisSheep sorrel Rumex acetosellaShepherd\u2019s purse Capsella bursa-pastorisSmart weeds Polygonum spp.Snakeroot, black Sanicula canadensisSnakeroot, white Eupatorium rugosumSow thistles Sonchus spp.Speedwells Veronica spp.Spring beauty Claytonia virginicaSpurges Euphorbia spp.St. John\u2019s wort Hypericum perforatumStar-of-Bethlehem Ornithogalum umbellatumSumac, smooth Rhus glabraSump weed Iva annuaSunflower Helianthus annuusSweet clover, white Melilotus albusSweet clover, yellow Melilotus officinalisTeasel Dipsacus sylvestrisThistle Cirsium vulgareTimothy Phleum pratenseUnicorn plants Proboscidea spp.Venus\u2019s looking glass Triodanus perfoliataViolet, dooryard Viola sororiaVirginia creeper Parthenocissus quinquefoliaVirginia rock cress Sibara virginicaWhitlow-grass Draba vernaWinter creeper Euonymus fortuneiWinter cress Barbarea vulgarisWitch grass Panicum capillareWood sorrels Oxalis spp.Yarrow Achillea millefolium* After Heiser, C.

Sometimes the search for useful or preciousplants was the principal justification for a voyage;at other times they were incidental.' The early voyages were not well-documented.Those of Columbus marked a turning point.' Sometimes the expeditions were paid for withprivate funds; mostly they were sponsored bymonarchs or government agencies.' Especially since the 1700's, naturalists and artistswere often part of the expedition.' These voyages brought back tens of thousands ofscientific specimens, principally to the greatbotanical research centers in Europe and theUnited States.' The explorers also brought back criticalethnographic data; the first knowledge thatEuropeans had of many of the world\u2019s peoples.' Exploration continues!3.2 ! THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE\"I simply do not know where to go next. I never tirefrom looking at such luxurious vegetation, which is sodifferent from ours. I believe there are many plantsand many trees that could be worth a lot in Spain foruse as dyes, spices, and medicines; but to my greatsorrow I do not recognize them.... I am the saddestman in the world for not knowing what kind of thingsthese are because I am very sure that they arevaluable. I am bringing a sample of everything I can.\"(Christopher Columbus)' ' ' ' 'Christopher Columbus was not the first person inhistory to be involved in some aspect of botanicalexploration. Hatshepsut [1495-1475 B. C. E.], Queenof Egypt, is often cited as the individual behind thefirst botanical expedition. She ordered a military partyto the Land of Punt to bring back myrrh and otheraromatic resins used in religious ceremonies. TheVenetian, Marco Polo [1254-1324], explored Asia from1271 to 1295. His memoirs contain many referencesto pepper, sesame oil, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, andcassia, and to the production of these spices. He alsowrote of how people used various plants, such asflavoring wine with rice and spices.A little over 500 years ago, Christopher Columbus and80 or so companions left on a long ocean voyage, andthe world has not been the same since. Why did heundertake this great adventure? It was not to provethat the earth was a globe. That had been acceptedfact for quite some time. Columbus told his potentialsponsors that his voyage had three goals:(1) to find a water route to the Indies;(2) to bring back precious materials, including thewealth of the Indies themselves (black pepper,cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, etc.); and(3) to bring the message of Christianity to theheathen.Somewhat more privately, he suggested that some ofthis new found wealth could be used to freeJerusalem.If we look at how well he accomplished his statedgoals, we would have to conclude that Columbus wasa failure. He did not find the Indies, although hebelieved that he had until the day he died. He was notable to bring back caravels filled with precious spices.He did not succeed in bringing the message of hisreligion to the Indians.Perhaps we are being too harsh. Was he not the firstEuropean to travel to the New World? No! Norsemenvisited coastal North America in A. D. 900-1000. Theremay well have been Polynesian voyages to the Pacificside of South America centuries before Columbus.If he was not the first, at least he did discover a newworld. While it was new to him and to his companions,it was not new to the 60-70 million people who wereliving there at the time. It had been their home for10,000-60,000 years. They had built great cities in theAmericas when London and Paris were little more thandirty little villages.Why then do we make so much of a failed mission?The voyage of Columbus was the first documentedcontact. He kept diaries that we can still consult. Sofar as we know, he was also the first to return to theNew World, a second, third, and fourth time. He wasalso the first person to lay claim to what he hadfound. He became \"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" and theViceroy and Governor General of various lands.The true significance of the voyages of Columbus isthat he brought two existing worlds into contact withone another. He initiated communication andexchange -- a two-way movement of people, usefulplants and animals, harmful ones, ideas, prejudices,and diseases. This commerce has been called \"TheColumbian Exchange.\" His voyages and those whocame after him did create a New World.The log of the Santa Maria for 13 October 1492 givesus the first European reference to tobacco. \"In themiddle of the gulf ... I found a man in a canoecarrying a little piece of bread ... a gourd of water ...and some dry leaves which must be a thing very muchappreciated among them.\" Other major New World discoveries included maize(corn), the potato, many new kinds of beans, thepeanut, vanilla orchid, chocolate, pineapple, horse,-46-and turkey. The Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations cites four principal plants that feedour species: wheat, rice, maize, and the potato --three cereals and a root crop. Two are of New Worldorigin.A more complete listing of the two-way traffic thatconstitutes the Columbian Exchange follows:FROM THE NEW WORLD TO THE OLDCereals:Maize, wild-riceRoot Crops:Potato, sweet potato, Jerusalem artichoke, cassavaVegetables:Beans (lima, scarlet), squash, pumpkinsSpices/Flavorings:Peppers, vanilla, pimento, allspice, coriander(cilantro), chocolateFruits/Nuts:Pecan, black walnut, blueberry, cranberry,strawberry, persimmon, cashew, pineapple, guava,papaya, avocado, sunflowerBeverages:Cacao (chocolate)Medicinal/Psychoactive:Quinine, coca, tobaccoMiscellaneous:Rubber, sugar maple, turkey, slaves, syphilis (?)FROM THE OLD WORLD TO THE NEWCereals:Wheat, barley, rice, oats, millets (a group of small-grained cereals)Vegetables:Cabbage, lettuce, onions, watermelon, soybean,peas, lentilsSpices/Flavorings:Black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, apple, pear, citrusfruits, olive, bananaBeverages:Coffee, teaMedicinal/Psychoactive:Foxglove, opium, marijuanaMiscellaneous:Sugar cane, sugar beet, horse, cow, pig, chicken,honeybee, slaves, missionaries, smallpox,diphtheria, measles3.3 ! THE POLYNESIANEXCHANGEWhile much has been made, and justifiably so, of thevoyages of Columbus and their consequences, lessattention is often paid to the cultural and biologicalimportance of the earlier oceanic explorations madeby Asians who traveled to the far outposts of what wenow call Polynesia. The spread of these Proto-Polynesians and their plants and animals acrossthousands of miles and taking thousands of years tocomplete is one of the great events in human history.THE POLYNESIAN EXPANSIONB.

In many cases, the leader of theexpedition had no particular training or interest inbotany or natural history. However, the exploringparty often included specialists in various areas.Charles Darwin served on the H. M. S. Beagle.Joseph Banks was the naturalist on Captain Cook'sfirst voyage to the South Pacific. Other greatexpeditions were led by scientists, such as Alexandervon Humboldt, for the specific purpose of collectingbotanical specimens and making detailedobservations. The diaries and field notes of thefamous explorers often contained information aboutuseful plants, how they were prepared, theiraboriginal names, and other ethnographic data.Vasco da Gama [1469?-1524], Portuguesenavigator. His party of about 170 men on four shipsexplored the coasts of Africa and India. They wereespecially interested in locating cloves, pepper, andginger.Francisco Pizarro [1470-1541], Spanishconqueror of Peru. The dates of his major activitiesare 1524-1525, 1526-1527, and 1531-1533.Ferdinand Magellan [1480-1521], Portuguesenavigator and explorer. Of particular interest is hisvoyage to the Spice Islands from 1519-1522.Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s [1485-1547], Spanish conquerorof Mexico (1519-1521).Francisco de Orellano [1490-1546], Spanishexplorer of the Amazon (1541-1542) and usuallycited as the first man to go down the Amazon River.Gaspar de Carvajal kept detailed diaries. He wrote ofa race of tall, white, naked warrior women who usedthe bow and arrow much better than did the maleIndians. He called them Amazons. A second voyageoccurred in 1545-1546.Jacques Cartier [1491-1557], French explorer.His three voyages (1534-1542) provided an earlyinventory of the natural products of the New World.Francisco Hernandez [1515-1578], Spanishphysician and natural historian. His work wascompiled into 16 folio-sized volumes that were sentto King Philip II. He deposited them in the library atthe Escorial. A terrible fire would later destroy mostof Hernandez's work.Jan Pieterszoon Coen [1587-1629], Dutchexplorer. He sailed to the Spice Islands, where heattempted to control the sales of cloves, nutmeg,and pepper.Abel Tasman [1602-1659], Dutch navigator andexplorer (1642-1643; 1644) of the South Pacific. Hediscovered New Zealand and Van Damien's Land,now known to us as Tasmania.Louis-Antoine de Bougainville [1729-1811],French navigator and explorer who wascommissioned by the French to circumnavigate theglobe (1766-1769) on the La Boudeuse and theL'Etoile (storeship). He explored Tahiti, Samoa, NewHebrides, Falklands, Great Barrier Reef, New Guinea,and Pitcairn Island. The popular ornamentalBougainvillea is named in his honor.James Cook [1728-1779], English navigator andexplorer. First voyage: 1768 to 1771 on H. M. BarkEndeavour. The crew consisted of 71 navy, 12marines, and 11 civilians. In the party were thebotanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, and theartist (botanical draughtsman) Sydney Parkinson.Second voyage: 1772 to 1775 on H. M. S. Resolutionand H. M. S. Adventure. George Vancouver andWilliam Bligh were on board. The artists were JohannForster and his son George. Third voyage: 1776 to1779 on H. M. S. Resolution and H. M. S. Discovery.George Vancouver and William Bligh on board. Thenaturalist was William Anderson and the artist wasJohn Webber.

Commissioned byLouis XV, his was the first scientific expedition toSouth America (1735-1745). The party of tenconsisted of an astronomer, a mathematician, amedical doctor, an artist, and a botanist (Joseph deJussieu). The principal reason for the trip to SouthAmerica was to settle an argument between theFrench and the English as to the shape of the Earth.Newton had argued that our planet was flattened atthe poles; Cassini that it was flattened at theequator. While there the party discovered a rubberlatex tree, brought out samples of the fever barktree (later to be named Quinaquina condamine), andplatinum. When de Jussieu's botanical specimenswere lost at sea, he went insane and had to be putaway.Joseph Banks [1743-1820], English botanist,explorer, and long time President of the Royal-48-Society. Sir Joseph sailed with Cook on theEndeavour, but refused to go on the second voyageto the Pacific because the ship would not be modifiedto meet his needs. It was Banks who recommendedto King George III that William Bligh be sent toTahiti for breadfruit, and who named Botany Bay inAustralia. The genus Banksia of Australia is namedin his honor.Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander, Baronvon Humboldt [1769-1859], Prussian scientistand explorer of Central and South America (1799-1804). The Baron has been described as the \"lastgreat universal man.\" Darwin called him \"thegreatest scientific traveler who ever lived.\" As to hismission, von Humboldt said \"I shall make collectionsof fossils and plants. I intend to institute chemicalanalysis of the atmosphere and I shall makeastronomical observations. My attention will be everdirected to observing harmony among the forces ofnature....\" Intense! He and Aim\u00e9e Bonpland (1773-1858) traveled about 40,000 miles, made 1500measurements, collected about 60,000 plantspecimens in South America and they were the firstEuropeans to observe the preparation of the curarearrow poisons. He also investigated the connectionbetween the Amazon and the Orinoco rivers anddiscovered the ocean current that bears his name.After leaving Central America, the Baron had dinnerone evening in Washington, D. C. with another manvery much interested in natural history \u2013 PresidentThomas Jefferson! Once back in Europe,  vonHumboldt spent 23 years preparing the manuscriptof his 29 volume narrative! Samuel Wallis [1728-1795], English navigatorand explorer (1766-1768). Sailing on H. M. S.Dolphin, he discovered Tahiti in 1767, naming it KingGeorge the Third's Island.Andr\u00e9 Michaux [1746-1803], French botanist. Heconcentrated on eastern North America, sendingback some 5000 tree seedlings and thousands ofseed packets to Versailles. Michaux delivered gifts ofseeds from Lafayette to Washington. He would die ofa fever in Madagascar.William Bligh [1754-1817], English navigator.Bligh was sent by George III to transport breadfruitfrom Tahiti to England. First voyage: 1787-1789(\"Operation Breadfruit\") on H. M. S. Bounty. Thebotanist was David Nelson. The famous mutinyoccurred on 28 April 1789. Nelson sided with CaptainBligh. We botanists are establishment people. Asecond voyage in 1791 on H. M. S. Providencesuccessfully transported the breadfruit plants backto England. Bligh explored Tahiti, Tasmania, and Fiji.He rose to the rank of Vice Admiral in the RoyalNavy and was later appointed Governor of NewSouth Wales in Australia. An edible and toxic fruittree, Blighia sapida, is named in his honor.Hipolito Ruiz Lopez [1754-1816] and AntonioPavon y Jimenez [1754-1840], Spanish explorersin South America. They are known in the botanicalliterature as Ruiz and Pavon. Trained aspharmacists, they collected 55 cases of specimens ofeconomic plants and would coauthor the \"FloraPeruviana et Chilensis.\" A fire destroyed much oftheir material. Ruiz once complained that he hadsuffered from \"... heat, fatigue, hunger, thirst,nakedness, want, storms, earthquakes, plague ofmosquitos and other insects, continuous danger ofbeing devoured by jaguars, bears and other wildbeasts, traps of thieves and disloyal Indians, treasonof slaves, falls from precipices and the branches oftowering trees, fording of rivers and torrents... andthe most touching of all, the loss of manuscripts.\"Mathew Flinders [1774-1814], English navigatorand explorer. He served with Bligh on a secondvoyage to the Society Islands (1801-1803). RobertBrown, a leading English botanist, accompanied himon his exploration of the coasts of Australia. Theartist was Ferdinand Bauer.Meriwether Lewis [1774-1809], personalsecretary to President Thomas Jefferson andAmerican explorer, and William Clark [1770-1838], U. S. soldier and explorer. The Lewis & ClarkExpedition (1804-1806) had as its primary goal thediscovery of a waterway from the Mississippi River tothe Pacific coast. Other, less publicized, objectiveswere more commercial and military, including findingthe best farmland for future settlers in the West.Along the way, the party of 48 collected plant,animal, and geological specimens, and NativeAmerican artifacts. Daniel Boone was asked to goalong, but he declined. The early plant collectionswere sent back to Thomas Jefferson, who sortedthem. In the Bitterroot Mtns., Lewis found the theplant that was later named after him (Lewisiarediviva). The genus Clarkia, of the evening-primrose family, commemorates William Clark.J. S. C.

The party visited 280islands and collected 50,000 botanical specimens.The botanical work of the expedition was publishedby Asa Gray of Harvard Univ. Wilkesiagymnoxiphium, a silver-sword relative known onlyfrom Hawai'i, is named after the admiral. It was alsoon this expedition that Darlingtonia californica, theCalifornia pitcher plant or cobra-lily, was firstcollected.Stephen Harriman Long [1784-1864], AmericanArmy officer and explorer of the Great Plains ofNorth America (1820).Thomas Nuttall [1786-1859], English naturalistwho explored the Ozarks, Arkansas River, Hawaii,and California. He was one of the founders of thePhiladelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. Most ofNuttall's botanical discoveries were \"appropriated\"and published by Frederick Pursh. After botanizing inthe San Diego area, Nuttall returned to the East-49-Coast on the Pilgrim, accompanied by one of hisformer students, Richard Henry Dana. Who wasDana?David Douglas [1799-1834], indefatigableScottish collector, especially of horticulturallyimportant plants. By the time he was 28, Douglashad been elected to the Linnean Society, theZoological Society, and the Geological Society inEngland. His specimens are deposited at the NaturalHistory Museum in London. Douglas was the firstEuropean to collect the California laurel, the sugarpine, chinquapin, Ponderosa pine, and the Douglas-fir. He died under mysterious circumstances,presumably being killed by a wild bull in a pit inHawai'i.Charles Darwin [1808-1882], English naturalistand explorer. He served as the naturalist on H. M.

TWO MODERN REVOLUTIONS4.1 ! AN OVERVIEW' The first great agricultural revolution occurredthousands of years ago when humans begancultivating and later domesticating plants. Thoseprocesses continue.' After a few millennia, our understanding of plantshad progressed to the point where we haddeveloped two important techniques \u2013 graftingand crossing of closely related plants to yieldhybrids that combined desirable traits.' Two highly significant advances occurred in the20th century. The Green Revolution and geneticengineering can be thought of as second and thirdagricultural revolutions.' Both are based on recent advances in geneticsand technology.' Both have already demonstrated great successesin increasing the world\u2019s food supplies and thequality of plant resources available to us.' The Green Revolution has also been called the\u201cRevolution That Failed\u201d and has been criticizedfor its negative economic impact, especially in theThird World.' Genetic manipulation of plants remains verycontroversial, with critics expressing concernsabout the effects of genetically engineeredorganisms on the human body, on nutritionalquality of foods, and on the environment.4.2 ! THE GREENREVOLUTION\u201cIt is as if man had been appointed managing directorof the biggest business of all, the business ofevolution... whether he is conscious of what he isdoing or not, he is in point of fact determining thefuture direction of evolution on this earth. That is hisinescapable destiny, and the sooner he realizes it andstarts believing in it, the better for all concerned.\u201d[SirJulian Huxley, 1957]\u201cWe are now in a position where we must not onlymanage our crop plants, our domestic animals, ourfisheries, out forests and range lands, but the wholeglobe is in our care, ready or not, competent or not.We are affecting the atmosphere, the oceans, theforests, rainforests, deserts, and even the climate. Weare woefully unprepared for this awesomeresponsibility. This is an age of great knowledge andlittle wisdom, but we have no choice; we must blunderon. Who is in charge here? God h[eJlapc uks H, awrela anr,e 1!\u201d992]\u201cTwenty-seven years ago, in my acceptance speechfor the Nobel Peace Prize, I said that the GreenRevolution had won a temporary success in man\u2019s waragainst hunger, which if fully implemented, couldprovide sufficient food for human-kind through to theend of the 20th century. But I warned that unless thefrightening power of human reproduction was curbed,the success of the Green Revolution would only beephemeral.... The more pertinent question today iswhether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to usethis new technology. Extremists in the environmentalmovement from the rich nations seem to be doingeverything they can to stop scientific progress in itstracks.\u201d[Norman Borlaugh in a 1997 address]TIMELINE: GREEN REVOLUTION1839 U.

' ' ' 'The genetic manipulation of plants and of animals is afairly recent development. After all, the field ofgenetics is only about a century old. Gregor Mendel'swork on garden peas was published in 1866 in arelatively obscure journal. It was rediscovered in1900. A few years later, the terms \"gene\" and\"genetics\" were first used. This does not mean,however, that our attempts to control and to takeadvantage of desired traits in plants is also somethingrelatively new. Grafting is an ancient technique usedto combine the tissues of two or more plants. Theplant that provides the root system and lower portionof the stem is called the stock; the new section ofplant that is added to the stock is called the scion.The interaction between the different genetic systemscan influence the appearance of the plant (e. g. yielda dwarf fruit tree), affect its hardiness, or modify itsresistance to disease. Unlike higher animals, plantshave not developed the antibody mechanisms that canlead to tissue rejection. However, if the stock andscion are too structurally and physiologically different,-51-graft incompatibility may occur. Grafting of fruit treesis very common. On your next Napa Valley winerytour, look carefully at the grape vines. You will seewhere European grape vines have been grafted on toAmerican stocks.Long before we understood the rudiments of genetics,we had discovered the advantages of cross-breedingor hybridization. We learned by trial and error thatwe could take the pollen from one plant that had itsparticular set of desirable features and place it on thestigmas of another plant that had features that alsosuited us. The object of all of this was to produceoffspring that combined the desirable features of thetwo plants. We soon discovered that only closelyrelated plants could be crossed or hybridized -- wheatwith barley, but not wheat with rice. In nature, it isthe wind, or insects, birds, bees, water, etc. thatcarries the pollen from one plant to another. Thetechniques of hybridization require that we controlpollen transfer to make certain that it is only thepollen that we want that finds its way on to thestigmatic surface of another flower. We emasculateflowers to prevent self-pollination. We hide flowersbehind netting or enclose them in bags to preventpollinators or the wind from effecting cross-pollination.When we are the agent of pollination, we use littlebrushes, sticks, or our fingers to dab pollen onreceptive stigmas. Then we cover up the flowers toprevent further, natural pollination from occurring.Many of our best known crop plants are the result ofmany generations of hybridizations and arethemselves very complex hybrids that combine thegenetic heritage of many different plant varieties.A quiet agricultural revolution began in the 1930's.Plant breeders in this country and elsewhere in theworld perfected the techniques needed to increasedramatically the yield of several of our most importantcrops, especially cereal grains. The effort was anattempt to provide higher crop yields to feed an everincreasing human population. The technology itselfwas then made available to the governments indeveloping countries where the need was acute. In1943, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexicangovernment established the Centro Internacional deMejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo (International Center forthe Improvement of Maize and Wheat).Several decades later this massive program of cropimprovement has become known as the \"GreenRevolution.\" Sugar cane, maize, wheat, rice and thesoy bean have been the major players. Yields perhectare (1 hectare = 2.471 acres) in the United Statesincreased dramatically: wheat (115%), rice (117%),maize (320%), sugar cane (141%), peanut (295%),soybeans (112%), cotton (188%), and the potato(311%).If we were to single out a particular crop and aparticular person as the \"stars\" of the GreenRevolution, they would be wheat and Norman Borlaug.By 1954, he had developed high-yielding varieties(HYV) of wheat, semi-dwarf forms with immenseyields of grain. These cultivars were also moreresistant to fungal attacks and had stems better ableto bear up under heavy applications of fertilizerswithout falling over (lodging) in wind or rain. Mexico,which had been able to meet only 1/3 of its needs forwheat, then became an exporter. Similar success wasseen in India. In recognition of his efforts, NormanBorlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. TheNobel Committee cited his technological advances thatwould make \"... it possible to abolish hunger in thedeveloping countries in the course of a few years.\"Unfortunately, this would not be the case.The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations sponsored theInternational Rice Research Institute in Los Banos, ThePhilippines. New strains matured earlier, had morethan one crop per year, and had more grains perhead.PLANT GERMPLASM CENTERSA series of agricultural research centers now existsaround the world. They are involved in the continuingprocess of crop improvement and of preservingdifferent genetic strains of particular plants. Theseunits are called germplasm centers because they storesamples of the hereditary material \u2013 the chromosomesand genes \u2013 of various crop plants. The ones that aredevoted to plant investigations are listed below.CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura) in Cali, Colombia. Beans, cassava, rice, and tropicalpasture plants.CIMMYT (Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Ma\u00edz y Trigo) in Londres, Mexico. Wheat,maize, and triticale.CIP (Centro Internacional de la Papa) in Lima, Peru. Sweet potatoes.IBPGR (International Board for Plant Genetic Resources) in Rome, Italy. A wide variety ofuseful plants.ICARDA (International Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas) in Aleppo, Syria.Barley, lentil, faba bean, durum wheat, breadwheat, and chickpeas.ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institutefor the Semi-Arid Tropics). Sorghum, millet,chickpea, pigeon pea, and groundnut.IITA (International Institute of Tropical Agriculture) in Ibaden, Nigeria. Cassava, maize,plantain, cowpea, soy bean, rice, and yams.IRRI (International Rice Research Institute) in Manila, The Phillipines. Rice.WARDA (West African Rice Development Association) in the Cote d'Ivoire. Rice.SEED BANKSThe need to maintain a collection of germplasm of ourcrops and their wild ancestors is not a new idea. N. I.Vavilov established a collection of seed samples in hislaboratory in St. Petersburg, then called Leningrad. Itstill exists. Hundreds of thousands of samplesgathered on various expeditions around the worldwere stored there. Today we call such collections seedbanks. We have 19 seed banks in this country thatcollectively form the National Plant GermplasmSystem. The main facility is in Fort Collins, Colorado.The various international research centers listedearlier in this section perform a similar function. To amuch more limited extent, certain of our largerbotanical gardens also preserve some of this geneticheritage.THE REVOLUTION THAT FAILED?\u201cIn most developing nations, food is still grown mainlywith traditional methods; even where appropriate, thegreen revolution and its yield-boosting inputs arelargely unaffordable or unavailable to subsistencefarmers.\u201d[Anne & Paul Ehrlich, 1987]Even the most enthusiastic supporters of the GreenRevolution admit that it has not been an unqualified-52-success. Its harsher critics label it as a major failure.What has cast such a pall over the early optimism?To begin with, these high yield varieties require agreat deal of tender, loving care -- more water, morefertilizer, more pesticides, and more equipment toplant and to harvest them. The newer fertilizers mayrequire two or three times more nitrogen andphosphorus. There has been a three fold increase inthe use of pesticides, leading to environmentalpollution. Much more irrigation water is required.Massive irrigation projects may be needed. Aquifers,underground water supplies, become depleted. Themachinery needed for harvesting crops istechnologically advanced and expensive. Developingcountries often find themselves deeply in debt to payfor the seed, fertilizer, equipment, etc.The new cultivars are in some ways nutritionallyinferior to those planted before the Green Revolution.The protein content of Kansas wheat declined by44.7% in the period 1940-1969. Prehybrid maize had82% more crude protein; 37% more copper; 113%more manganese than current hybrids. In rice, proteincontent is down from 9-10% to 7-8%. The appearanceand taste of bread and other products made from thenew cultivars was sometimes disappointing.The Green Revolution has also favored the practice ofmonoculture, the growing of a single strain of aparticular crop year after year, and often over largeexpanses of farm land. As our plant breedingtechniques improved, it was possible to plant seed ofthese new high yielding strains that produced geneticcarbon copies of one another. It was wonderful! Theplants all looked alike, came into flower and fruit atthe same time, could be harvested at the same time,and they all had the same set of desirable features.This all sounds very positive.Our increasing reliance on the monoculturing of highyield varieties is dangerous. As the 21st  centurybegins, we find ourselves dependent upon a handfulof cultivars for each of our major crops. As Levitin &McMahon (1996) point out, in the United States halfour wheat crop is derived from only nine cultivars; 4cvs. of potato account for 75% of the crop; 3 cvs.yield half of our cotton crop. In this country, we nolonger grow about 90% of the different varieties ofcrops that we grew before the Green Revolution. Thismeans that the genetic variability that was storedaway in those thousands upon thousands of cultivarsis lost to us.If we have these spiffy high-yielding varieties, why arewe concerned about losing the genes in these cultivarsthat we are not growing because they are inferior tothe HYV's? Because these traditional varieties or landraces, as they are sometimes called, are thereservoirs of the genetic heritage of the new strains.They are the source of the germplasm, the library ofthe genetic codes needed by plant breeders tomaintain, to modify, and to create new strains ofthese critical crops. Some of the first high yieldcultivars of the Green Revolution, such as IR-8 rice,have already shown signs of genetic deterioration.Only an infusion of genes from the very cultivars thatthey were to replace can save them.What if something happens to these cultivars? Thevery genetic uniformity that makes them so useful tous also makes them potentially vulnerable to disaster.If one plant of a particular cultivar is susceptible to afungal pest, then all of them will be. They aregenetically identical. This is not simply a theoreticalconcern. It has happened. In the 1840's, the potatocrop in Ireland was decimated by a fungus, the lateblight of potato. In 1892, coffee rust, another fungalinfection, wiped out the plantations in Ceylon. Themaize varieties in this country that contained the genefor cytoplasmic male sterility were hit badly by thecorn leaf blight in 1970. A bacterial infection of citrustrees in Florida killed millions of trees. New resistantcultivars were needed. Where do plant breeders go forthe genes they need? To the germplasm reservoirstored in the land races.SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTUREModern agriculture has tended to substitute: (1)continual culture of a single crop for crop rotation anddiversification; (2) herbicides and pesticides forbiological control; (3) inorganic fertilizers that must bepurchased, rather than organic ones or green manure;and (4) larger agricultural fields in place of smallerfamily farms.The perils are obvious. What do we do? One solutionhas been called \"organic farming,\" \"alternativeagriculture,\" or \"sustainable agriculture.\" The basicprinciple underlying this approach is that a plot of landhas to be seen as a small ecosystem, not as a factory.It is an ecosystem that must be maintained inbalance. The techniques include:' switch from monoculture to polyculture;' switch from annual to perennial crops;' crop rotation;' biological pest control;' working the soil to minimize erosion;' use of animal manure and green manure; and' control weeds and disease.Plant breeders are now developing perennial forms ofsorghum by crossing the annual (Sorghum bicolor)with the common Johnson grass (S. halepense), aperennial weed. Similar efforts may produce a newform of maize by crossing the annual crop (Zea mays)with a recently discovered perennial, wild teosinte(Zea diploperennis).Sustainable agriculture sounds like a return to thetechniques of long ago, but it is much more than that.For a farm to be sustainable it must produce adequateamounts of high-quality food, it must beenvironmentally safe, and it may even turn a profit.Such enterprises must minimize what they purchaseexternally and rely upon the renewable resources ofthe farm itself. About 90% of the farms that practicethese alternative methods are in poorer parts ofworld.4.3 !

The pollen grains had in themnot only the genes for the desirable feature, but manyothers as well. We may not want them. Thetechniques were also laborious and time consuming.What plant breeders wanted was the ability to produceoffspring that combined specific traits. Once ourunderstanding of basic genetics was in place, webegan to realize that someday we ought to be able tocontrol reproduction in plants -- to produce carboncopies of plants that had we found useful to us or totransfer specific genes from one plant to another. Wenow have a series of new techniques at our disposal toaccomplish exactly those goals.CLONING. The term comes from the Greek word fortwig. In this procedure, we use individual cells from aplant with desirable features to produce whole plantswith the those traits. These are the \u201ctwigs\u201d of theparent plant. The process involves:Removing tissue from plantLSeparating  cells from one anotherLDissolving cell wallsL-54-Putting cells in nutrient solutionLCells clumping together to form callus tissueLNurturing callus tissue into adult plantsPROTOPLAST FUSION. The cell membrane and allthat is inside it is a protoplast. In protoplast fusion,we create new forms by combining cells from differentplants and then regenerating a hybrid from the fusedcells. The result is a somatic hybrid. Protoplastfusion occurs naturally or it can be induced bytreatment with electrical shock or with certainchemicals, such as polyethylene glycol. One gram ofplant tissue may contain as many as 4 millionprotoplasts that are capable of maturing into adultplants, either one their own or after being fused withother cells. Sometimes the results are adisappointment. The \u201cpomato\u201d is a somatic hybrid ofthe potato and tomato. It produces both tomato fruitsand potato tubers, but both are small and its seed isinferior. On the other hand, when a potato protoplastwas fused with one from a triazine-resistant blacknightshade (both members of the genus Solanum),the somatic hybrid could be grown in soil that hadbeen treated with triazine -- a potent herbicide.Crops that have been regenerated through protoplastfusion include citrus, the sunflower, cassava, clover,millets, cabbage, and asparagus.GENETIC ENGINEERING. The most recent and mostcontroversial technique goes by a variety of names,such as genetic engineering, gene splicing, andbiotechnology. This highly advanced technology allowsus to alter the genetic makeup of plants byintroducing single genes from the nucleus of one plantinto the nucleus of another. The \"host plant\" thenreproduces new cells that contain the genes that havebeen transferred into its nuclei. The new forms areoften called transgenic organisms, or geneticallymodified or genetically manipulated organisms.In the popular press, they are often called \"GM\" plantsand animals, or \u201cGMO\u2019s.\u201dThe process is easy to describe, but it requires rathersophisticated techniques. Identify desired gene and its locationLIsolate gene using restriction enzymesLInsert gene into new host plantLActivate gene in host DNALDesirable feature appearsFirst, you must identify the desired gene and itslocation. Then you isolate the gene and remove itfrom the donor plant by using enzymes that cut achromosome at a specific spot. Finally, you musttransfer the gene into the host plant. This isaccomplished by plucking out the gene with a pair oflittle tiny tweezers and carrying it across thelaboratory to the host plant, hoping that you don\u2019tsneeze or stumble or drop the gene on the floor. Well,not exactly.In most cases, the transfer of the gene isaccomplished by using Agrobacterium tumefaciens,the soil bacterium that causes crown gall disease invarious crop plants. This bacterium has the ability topenetrate host cell nuclei and to introduce fragmentsof its own DNA, called plasmids. The genetic code ofthe plasmid then instructs the host plant to produceexcess hormones. This results in the growth of tumortissue, the crown gall. The bacterium itself finds thistissue to be a suitable home. These days, we takeadvantage of the bacterial plasmid by using it as thevector or carrier of the genetic material that we wantto transfer from one plant to another. In thelaboratory, we culture in a petri dish bacteria thathave had the desired gene inserted into their DNA.The bacteria infect pieces of tissue from the host plant-- the one that will be the recipient of the gene. Thehost cells are now transformed or we say thattransformation has occurred. By the way, thebacterial plasmids have been \u201cdisarmed\u201d geneticallyso that they will not cause the crown gall tumortissues to form, as they do in nature. The transformedhost tissues are then moved to a new growth mediumthat kills off the bacteria and that induces theformation of callus tissue, shoots, and eventually awhole new plant. Common examples of crops plants that have beentransformed and regenerated by this techniqueinclude maize, rice, wheat, barley, rye, cotton, flax,soybean, sunflower, beans, peas, lettuce, potatoes,sugar beet, tobacco, tomato, apples, and walnuts.Even newer procedures involve injecting genes into anucleus using microscopic needles and shooting DNA-coated pellets fired into host tissues with DNA particleguns. The latter is the technique favored by  theNational Rifle Association.THE MAJOR PLAYERSTHE PLANTS THE ENGINEERSMaizeTomatoSoy beanPotatoCottonTobaccoRapeseedMelons/squashesAlfalfaRiceMonsantoPioneer Hi-Bred SeedCalgeneUpjohnDupontDe KalbU. S. Dept. AgricultureFrito-LayDNA Plant TechnologyTHE RESULTS OF GENETIC ENGINEERINGIn 1996, about 7 million acres of transgenic cropswere grown around the world; in 1997, 31.5 millionacres. In 1998, farmers in this country, Argentina,Canada, Australia, Mexico, Spain, France, and SouthAfrica planted 69.6 million acres of geneticallymodified crops. In the United States, about 40% ofthe corn crop is GM; 27% of  the soybeans wereengineered to be herbicide resistant, as was 27% ofthe cotton crop. Three percent of our potato crop hasbeen transformed to have a built-in pesticide.Genetic engineering allows us to produce plants thatcan fix their own nitrogen, which means that they willuse less fertilizer. By increasing their tolerance of heavy metals and salinity, and by increasing droughtand frost resistance, we can grow crops in a widervariety of locations. By increasing resistance toherbicides and by manufacturing their owninsecticides, the competitive advantage of geneticallymodified crops is also enhanced.It is also possible to view crop plants as \u201cmolecularfarms,\u201d living factories that can be geneticallymanipulated to produce the raw materials of industry-55--- starch, essential and fixed oils, enzymes, and evenhuman medicines. Genetic engineers at Michigan StateUniv. have produced transformed plants that make abiodegradable plastic that would ordinarily have beenmanufactured by the bacterium itself. Belgianscientists have developed a procedure for producinghuman neuropeptides in the seeds of the canola oilplant. In the popular press, the genetic engineeringmedicines are called farmaceuticals.Genetic engineering to produce biopesticides is still inits infancy. These newer techniques promise to bemuch more precise than our traditional \u201cspray andpray\u201d approach to pesticide and herbicide application.Another bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis, known to itsfriends simply as \u201cBt,\u201d makes a protein that is toxic tocaterpillars that eat various plants. The gene from Btthat makes that protein has been transferred toanother bacterium (Pseudomonas fluorescens) thatlives in the roots of corn plants. When corn seeds thathave been coated with the transformed bacteriumgerminate, they are protected from the caterpillarsthat would have eaten their roots! Last year about 1million acres of Bt corn were planted in the Midwest.Yield went up 10-15%.AN OVERVIEWEcological:Fix their own nitrogenIncreased tolerance of heavy metalsIncreased tolerance of salty soils or salt waterIncreased tolerance of drought/water stressIncreased tolerance of freezing temperaturesDetoxification of contaminated soilsPest and Weed Management by Resistance to:HerbicidesInsectsVirusesFungiBacteriaImproved Post-Harvest Qualities:Delay of ripeningImproved storage capabilityImproved Nutritional Qualities:High starch potatoesSweeter fruits and vegetablesHigher amino acid content (lysine)Plant Cells as Molecular Farms:StarchEssential oilsBiodegradable plasticsFixed oilsEnzymesHuman/veterinary medicinesNEW PLANTS? WHO OWNS THEM?Those of us who are interested in the naming andclassifying of plants will fret over whether these newproducts of genetic engineering should be recognizedas distinct and given their own scientific names.Another group of people who are also very interestedin these novelties are patent attorneys. When acorporation or a university has invested millions ofdollars in perfecting these techniques andregenerating GMO\u2019s, when can it patent this new plantor animal to protect its investment, offer it for sale,and earn a profit? This is a very hot issue. In 1930,The United States Congress passed the Plant PatentAct. It covered plants that were asexually propagated.The 1970 Plant Variety Protection Act dealt withsexually reproducing plants -- but not their seeds. In1980, the United States Supreme Court ruled on acase that involved four different plasmids transferredinto a single bacterial cell. It ruled that \u201cnovel lifeforms\u201d could be patented, including all parts of theplant. That meant the adult plant itself, along withcuttings, seeds, and tissue cultures. Europeancountries have taken a much more conservativeapproach. The European Patent Convention makes itall but impossible to patent plants or animals or \u201c...biological processes for the production of plants oranimals.\u201d Another way to protect your investment has beendeveloped by Monsanto and its partners. It has beendubbed the \u201cterminator gene\u201d or the \u201csuicide seed.\u201dYou purchase the GM seed, you plant it, and it yieldsthe crop that you desired.  If you attempt to plant theseeds of the crop you have just harvested, you willdiscover that they  have been engineered to be sterile.You will have to go back to the seed store to buy moreseed to replant. Developers of the terminator genespoint out that you are not permitted to make copies ofvideos or books that you have purchased. Why shouldthe fruit of their work be any different. It is a geneticform of intellectual property.THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORYRecent articles in the popular press bear titles such as,\u201cThe Great Gene Escape,\u201d \u201dAttack of the GeneSplicers,\u201d \u201cAgricultural Biotech Faces Backlash inEurope,\u201d \u201cThe Suicide Seeds,\u201d and my personalfavorite, \u201cThe Curse of Frankenfood.\u201d Here, andespecially in Europe, we are seeing a backlash againstgenetic engineering. It is easy to dismiss some of thecritics as late-20th century versions of Luddites whooppose new inventions and technologies. However,there are a number of well-informed critics who raiselegitimate concerns. These include:Unexpected products of genetic engineering.GMO\u2019s can go ahead (on their own) to produce newpathogenic organisms, especially those that haveviruses incorporated into them.  We may also becreating \u201csuper weeds\u201d without realizing it.Contamination of traditional strains of cropplants. Pollen from GMO\u2019s can be carried by the wind,insects, etc. to non-GMO\u2019s in adjacent fields.Reliance on so few transformed plants. We areheading down the same path of monoculturing of ourcrops -- millions of acres devoted to one kind of GMcorn, GM cotton, etc. Farmers, especially those in theThird World, will become even more dependent onpatented seeds, associated pesticides and herbicides,which they cannot afford.Loss of traditional varieties of crop plants andtheir wild relatives. We will become so enamored ofthe GMO\u2019s that we will not continue to grow the oldstyle plants or worry about their wild relatives assources of genetic material. Gene pools of our cropswill continue to deteriorate.There will be unexpected and undesirableconsequences. Scientists at Cornell University havejust found that corn pollen from plants that have Bttoxin transferred into them will kill monarch butterflylarvae. The pollen had been sprinkled on milkweedplants, a favorite food of the butterfly. A major portion-56-of the butterfly\u2019s natural distribution overlaps the\u201ccorn belt.\u201dSafety of genetically-engineered foods. TheBritish tabloids call them \u201cFrankenfoods.\u201d Are GMO\u2019stoxic? Will they produce allergies in consumers?Nutritional quality. Are they as nutritious as thenon-GMO\u2019s?  Recent articles suggest that the GMversion of soybeans is lower in phytoestrogens,compounds that may protect us against heart diseaseand cancer.-57-   SECTION 5 ! FOOD PLANTS5.1 ! AN OVERVIEW' We are heavily dependent on a handful of cerealsand root crops as the major sources of our food.' How many plants are critical to feeding the world?From about six to one hundred, depending uponthe criteria employed, and which expert you ask.' Most of our food plants are of Old World origin.' While many food plants are important items ofinternational commerce, hundreds of others aregrown and consumed locally and are little-knownoutside the immediate region.' Very few new food plants have come on the scenein the last several thousand years.' Most of the spices and flavorings that we use havebeen around since ancient times.' We devote most of our land to the growing ofcereals.' All great civilizations, past and present, are basedupon the cultivation of cereals.' Several plant families that are important sourcesof food plants are also notorious for their toxicmembers. In fact, many food plants must beprepared properly to rid them of toxins.' Nor is the category \"food plant\" entirely distinctfrom \"medicinal plant\" or even \"psychoactiveplant.\"' Many of our most important food plants havesignificant nutritional deficiencies and do not, inand of themselves, provide an adequate diet.' Typically, we see in our markets only a narrowsegment of the spectrum of food plants potentiallyavailable.' We have often been fearful of and resistant toconsuming new foods.5.2 !

Theyprovide us with the materials needed to maintain life,to make new tissue; to grow. Food plants are also thesource of energy needed for the body's variousactivities.HOW MANY FOOD PLANTS?Estimates vary widely. The most recentcomprehensive survey by Kunkel (1984) shows about12,500 species in 400 plant families. Here are the topten families that are the sources of our food plants.01.

The summary that follows shows youthat there are well-known food plants that have toxicproperties. Sometimes it is a matter of processing; inother instances the toxicity is a function of individualsensitivities or even genetic makeup.Dermatitis: cashew, mango, pineappleGastrointestinal: potato, tomato, rhubarb, horseradish, spinachCirculatory/cardiovascular: fava bean, onions +allies, bananaSkeletal: sweet peaCellular (hydrogen cyanide poisoning): apples,peaches, lima bean, chick pea, cassava, flaxCentral nervous system: nutmegMutagens/teratogens (aflatoxins): peanutFOOD PLANT DETOXIFICATIONMany of our food plants contain toxins that must beremoved or destroyed before we can eat them. Wehave discovered a number of methods foraccomplishing this goal. According to Johns (1990),we have learned to detoxify plants by:heating: boiling, stewing, roasting, baking, frying,and steaming;soaking: in static water, soaking with change(s) ofwater, soaking in running water, leaching, soaking insalt water, soaking with ashes, lye, acids, and boiling;fermentation: spontaneous or using an inoculumfrom earlier preparations;adsorption: clay, charcoal, and mud;drying: sun, kiln, or hot-air;physical processing: peeling, grating or rasping,squeezing, pounding, grinding, and cutting; andchanging pH: lye or lime, acidic substances.WHICH ONES ARE CRITICAL TO US?While the question seems simple enough, the answerremains elusive.

ROOT CROPSThis category of food plants includes those with edibleroots, underground root-like stems, subterranean leafbases, and combinations of these tissues. In otherwords, root crops are not limited to just those foodplants that have edible roots, as the name might wellimply. In general, root crops are:' mostly water;' high in starches and/or sugars;' low in proteins and oils;' not easily stored, transported, or marketed;' not the basis of a balanced diet;' sometimes consumed raw, but often requireheating or some other processing to destroytoxins.The annual tonnage of the major root crops is almostas great as the cereal production. They exceed themajor cereals in their nutritional yield in terms ofmillions of calories per acre:  potato = 4.84; rice =2.77; maize = 2.55; wheat = 1.61.THE IRISH POTATO\u201cTwo things are too serious to talk about \u2013 marriageand potatoes.\u201d [Old Irish saying]\u201c... a scarcely innocent underground stem.\u201d[John Ruskin, 1869]Also known as the Irish or white potato, Solanumtuberosum probably originated in the AndeanMountains of Bolivia and Peru. It has been in usethere since at least A.D. 200 and it is still in commonuse. The potato is a tuber, a starchy, underground-61-stem. The eyes are buds; leaf scars are also evidenton the surface. The tuber is about 70-80% water, 8-28% starch, and 1-4% protein. The food value variesgreatly with cultivar, growth conditions, storage, andhandling. In Solanum tuberosum, x = 12 and there are diploids,tetraploids, and hexaploids. The Tuberosum Group, towhich our cultivars belong, is tetraploid (2n= 4x =48).TIMELINE: IRISH POTATOBCE:11,000 First archaeological remains (Chile)5,000 Alkaloid-free diploids evolve5,000 Domesticated ??CE:1533 First seen by Europeans (Pizzaro)1553 First European reference (\u201cChronica del Peru\u201d)1570 Introduced into Spain1585 Introduced into Italy1586 Introduced into England1588 Introduced into Ireland1590 Jos\u00e9 de Acosta describes chu\u00f1o making1597 First printed illustration (Gerard\u2019s \u201cHerball\u201d)1601 \u201cIt springs from a bulb\u201d (Clusius)1619 Gaspard Bauhin names it Solanumtuberosum esculentum1622 Governor of Bermuda sends them to Governorof Virginia1625 Now a food staple in Ireland1651 German Grand Elector forces their planting andconsumption1662 Royal Society considers planting throughoutEngland1664 John Forster publishes \u201cEngland\u2019s HappinessIncreased...\u201d1697 Introduced into Russia by Peter the Great1719 Introduced to U.

The potato was brought to Europe in themid-1500's and was planted extensively in NorthAmerica by about 1700. The plant was not animmediate success, for a variety of reasons. It wasseen to be a member of the nightshade family(Solanaceae), a group of plants long known for theirtoxic properties. There were also cultural and religiousbiases against the potato. Later its reputation changedand it became very popular. Often its planting was theresult of a royal edict. The potato became a dominantfood in the diet of the Irish. The \"late blight of potato,\"caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans, wipedout the Irish crops two consecutive years (1845-1847). It is estimated that 1.5 million died as a resultof the famine and that perhaps another millionIrishmen immigrated to the U.S.TOXICITY. When exposed to sunlight, potato tubersmake chlorophyll and turn green. They also increaseproduction of a toxin called solanine. It has causedsickness and death in domesticated animals that eatgreen tubers, but it rarely causes problems in humansbecause we destroy the toxin during the cookingprocess.USES.The potato is not just a food plant for us and forsome of our domesticated animals. Its starch is usedin textiles, paper, confections, and adhesives, and tomake industrial alcohol. Chicha is a South Americanbeer made from fermented potatoes. Schnapps is alsomade from potatoes.SWEET POTATOIpomoea batatas, a relative of the ornamentalmorning glory and the weedy bindweeds, is a trailingvine of tropical lowlands. The plants are vegetativelypropagated; many strains rarely flower. Its origin isstill a matter of controversy. It was probably used inboth the Old World and New World before Columbus.Current thinking appears to favor New World tropicallowlands as the sweet potato's ancestral home. Notethe similarities in common names:kumar \u2022 Quechua Indians (Andes)kumara \u2022 Polynesian islandsumara \u2022 Tahitiumala \u2022 Samoauwala \u2022 Hawai'iThe plant is very popular in the southern U.S., whereit is often called a yam. The true yams are entirelydifferent species and are rarely seen in this country.China is the leading producer of sweet potatoes. It has50% more calories than the Irish potato, usually lessprotein (1.5-2.0%), and is a good source of Vitamin A.The sweet potato is a polyploid (2n = 4x = 60 and 6x= 90).Henry VIII loved sweet potato pie. He thought that itwas good for his love life, a common belief of thetime. William Shakespear makes reference to thiswhen he has Falstaff hoping that the sky would rainpotatoes.CASSAVAManihot esculenta has a number of common names,including manioc and yuca (not to be confused withyucca, an entirely unrelated plant). Cassava is amember of the spurge family, known for its manytoxic species. It is a shrubby perennial of the tropicallowlands. It was originally from South America,perhaps eastern Brazil.  In Africa and in the WestIndies, cassava is cooked and then pounded into adough to make fufu, a traditional African pudding.The plant is not widely known outside of the tropics,-62-although there it is a very important plant. While youmay not know a cassava when you see it, you doknow a product made from its roots \u2013 tapioca. Thestarch from cassava and maize were used to makepostage stamp glue.The edible part is a series of swollen roots. With littlecare the plants will yield 10 tons of roots/acre. Theroots contain a poisonous glycoside that will yield HCN(hydrogen cyanide or Prussic acid) when it breaksdown. We have learned by trial and error that theroots must be heated to drive off this toxic gas. Theroots are consumed whole after boiling, or pulverizedand dried to a meal called farinha. The juices are alsoused to make alcoholic beverages and as a componentin meat sauces (West Indian pepper pot).YAMSFirst, please note that yams and sweet potatoes arenot the same thing, and that while all of the sweetpotatoes belong to a single species, there are severalspecies of yams. Dioscorea spp. are perennial climbingvines of the tropics. Three \"Groups\" are oftenrecognized: Asian, African, and America. Only one, thecush-cush yam, is native to the New World. The vineshave large storage tubers that can weigh up to severalhundred pounds. The plants may have aerial tubers aswell. The yam is a very important food in the WestIndies, much of South America, in Asia, and the SouthSea Islands. It is baked, boiled, or ground into flour.The yam is mostly starch. Several million tons areproduced each year.In addition to being an important root crop, the yamhas ritual and medicinal uses. I will tell you about thatlater in the semester.THE TRUE YAMS (DIOSCOREA)New World:D. trifida Cush-cush yam, ajam, yampiAfrica:D. abyssinica RikuaD. cayenensis Yellow Guinea yamD. dumetorum Bitter yam, 3-leaved yamD. bulbifera Potato-yam, air-potatoD. elephantipes Elephant's footD. rotundata White yam, Guinea yamAsia:D. alata Greater yam, water yamD. bulbifera Potato-yam, air-potatoD. esculenta Lesser yam, Asiatic y., Chinese y.D. hispida Intoxicating yam, namiD. japonica Japanese yamD. nummularia KerungD. opposita Chinese yamD. pentaphylla Sand yam, buck yamD. praehensilis Bush yam, forest yamPacific Islands:D. papuanD. spinosa Spiny yamTARO\u201cOne man\u2019s meal is another man\u2019s poi, son.\u201d(Restauranteur in Honolulu Polynesian bistro)' ' ' ' 'Colocasia esculenta, a member of the philodendronfamily, is very widely used by the peoples ofSoutheast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plants livein moist to swampy areas, seldom flower, andtypically have large leaf blades shaped like elephantears. The fleshy corms are eaten boiled, baked, ormashed; or they may be dried and pulverized. Thesetreatments destroy the calcium oxalate crystalspresent in the underground structures. These crystalsare quite characteristic of the family.In Hawai\u2019i, the plant is known as kalo. Its leaves areluau; the same word is also used for a soup made oftaro leaves and for the well known feast. As a soup,\u201c... it is as delicate, wholesome, and agreeable a oneas any in the world.\u201d (Sturvevant, 1919). The leavesare also called callaloo, as is a Caribbean soup madefrom taro leaves, okra, yams, chili peppers, andcoconut milk. Po'i, the famous Hawai\u2019ian dish, issteamed taro that has been crushed and fermented.So much of it is grown for local consumption thatprecise production figures are unavailable.Taro is only one of several important root cropsderived from the philodendron or aroid family. Thereis much confusion as to their common names.ARROWROOTSThere are several unrelated Old World and New Worldroot crops that are collectively known as arrowroots.They are important starch sources that we use as foodin the tropics and for a variety of other purposes. Thestarch is deposited in tubers or rhizomes.THE ARROWROOTSMaranta arundinacea arrowroot, W. Indian a.Tacca leontopetaloides Tahiti a., African a.Curcuma angustifolia Bombay arrowrootZamia pumila Florida arrowrootManihot esculenta Brazilian arrowroot, Par\u00e1 a.Canna indica Queensland arrowrootArrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) is the best knownmember of the group. Its rhizomes are cleaned,peeled, crushed, grated, and then washed to free thestarch. The resulting liquid is then centrifuged orpoured on to a flat surface to allow the starch to settleout. The air-dried starch lumps are pulverized to yielda very fine, small-grained starch. The highly-digestiblestarch is a favorite in foods for infants and invalids. Itis also used in various jellies and pastes. The starch isalso applied externally as a face powder and to treatwounds, ulcers, insect bites, and snake bites. Mostarrowroot comes from St. Vincent, in the West Indies.The United States is the chief importer.Tahiti arrowroot is a favorite starch crop of the SouthPacific. Its tubers are treated to remove taccalin, abitter chemical. Besides being a food plant, the starchis also processed to make the coating used on carbon-less computer paper. Tahiti arrowroot leaves are usedto make hats.-63-TABLE BEET AND SUGAR BEETThe many cultivars of Beta vulgaris that we now useare presumably derived from B. maritima of northernEurope. Close relatives include chard (edible leaves)and the mangelwurzel, all of which freely interbreed.Our own production of the sugar beet increaseddramatically in the early 1960's, after we boycottedcane sugar from Cuba. The sugar in sugar beets isidentical to that of cane sugar. The main ingredient inborsch, a Russian soup, is a puree of beets. Beetrootwine is a popular homemade wine.CARROTDaucus carota var. sativa is another of our ancientfood plants. It is perhaps native to the Afghanistanarea. It was highly prized by Europeans and wasbrought to America by the early colonists. The carrotis a biennial, although the plant is mature after thefirst year. There are many kinds of carrots, some withenormous root systems three feet long. The carrot isrich in vitamin A and sugar. At first it was considereda medicinal plant, its seeds used as a stimulant and asa diuretic. After many centuries it was considered afood plant. Eating carrots raw is a very recent habit.The early cultivars were purple. The orange onesbecame popular when they were exported fromHolland in the 17th and 18th centuries.PARSNIPPastinaca sativa, a carrot relative, has been cultivatedas a food plant since the days of the ancient Romans.However, the development of fleshy roots did notcome until the Middle Ages. The parsnip is high insugars and starch. We also make parsnip wine.JERUSALEM ARTICHOKEHelianthus tuberosus is a close relative of our nativeNorth American sunflower. The common name wouldcertainly suggest otherwise. According to oneexplanation, \"Jerusalem\" is a corruption of the Italianword for sunflower. The plants produce tubers that aresomewhat like the potato in appearance. Althoughnative to the New World, the Jerusalem artichoke isbetter appreciated in Europe and China. In the UnitedStates it is most often used as a food for hogs. Wheneaten by humans it is usually boiled or baked. TheJerusalem artichoke contains inulin, a sugar that maybe used by diabetics.THE BRASSICA ROOT CROPSSeveral different root crops are derived from thegenus Brassica, a member of the mustard family. Theturnip is a combination of edible stem and roottissue. There is considerable variation in the size,shape, and flesh color in different cultivars. The turniphas been used since prehistoric times. The rutabagais of recent origin, the result of hybridization betweenthe turnip and the cabbage sometime in the 17thcentury. The kohlrabi is a leafy stem base. It can getto be about the size of an orange when fully grown,but it is best eaten before it gets that large.THREE S. AMERICAN ROOT CROPSThere are several South American root crops that arein wide use there, but which are almost completelyunknown to us in this country. Chief among them isoca (Oxalis tuberosa), a relative of our local redwoodsorrel or sour-grass. It is used primarily in Peru,Ecuador, and Bolivia. The tubers are acid when fresh.They are usually dried in the sun so that they getmore floury and less acid. If dried for several weeks,oca takes on the flavor of dried figs.Two other crops of note are the a\u00f1u (Tropaeolumtuberosum), a relative of the garden nasturtium, andullucu (Ullucus tuberosus), an important Andean foodplant with no well known relatives in North America.-64-SURVEY OF ROOT CROPSCommon Name (Scientific Name) Plant Family Commenta\u00f1u (Tropaeolum tuberosum) Nasturtium South American tuberarracacha (Arracacia xanthorrhiza) Carrot Used in Peruvian regionarrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) Prayer plant Starchy rhizomesarrowroot, African (Tacca leotopetaloides) Tacca Starch sourcearrowroot, Indian (Curcuma angustifolia) Ginger Starch sourcearrowroot, Queensland (Canna edulis) Canna Starchy rhizomeartichoke, Chinese (Stachys floridana) Mint See crosneartichoke, Japanese (Stachys floridana) Mint See crosneartichoke, Jerusalem (Helianthus tuberosus) Sunflower Native to North Americabeet (Beta vulgaris) Goosefoot Relative of sugar beetcarrot (Daucus carota) Carrot Native to Near Eastcassava (Manihot esculenta) Spurge Important pantropical foodceleriac (Apium graveolens) Carrot Used in soups and stewschavar (Hitchenia caulina) Ginger Used like arrowroot; Indomalaysiachicory (Cichorium intybus) Sunflower Coffee flavoring/substitutechufa (Cyperus esculentus) Sedge Tubers rich in starch, sugar, oil; pantropicalcrosne (Stachys floridana) Mint Edible tubers; popular in Europe, esp.

STEMS, LEAVES, &FLOWERSThis group of food plants is relatively straight-forward.We tend, for obvious reasons, to consume thesevarious leaves and flowers while they are young andtender. The flower clusters are often so immature thatyou may not realize what you are eating.ONIONS AND THEIR ALLIESThe edible portion of various Allium spp. is the bulb,a modified stem system bearing a series ofoverlapping, fleshy leaves. The outer leaves are oftendry and papery. The stem itself is reduced and is oftendiscarded before the rest of the bulb is eaten.Chives A. schoenoprasumEgyptian onion A. cepa var. proliferumGarlic A. sativumGarlic chives A. tuberosumKurrats A. ampeloprasumLeeks A. ampeloprasumOnion A. cepaPotato onion A. cepa var. aggregatumRakkyo A. chinenseRocambole A. ampeloprasumShallots A. cepa var. aggregatumTree onion A. cepa var. proliferumWelsh onion A. fistulosumONION. The onion (Allium cepa) is of uncertainorigin. The common name derives from the Latin(unio), the French (oignon), and the Anglo-Saxon(onyon). It was in use by the Egyptians in 3000 B. C.It was a common food in Europe in the Middle Ages.Long ago, the onion had another reputation. It \u201c...serves no other thing but to provoke and stirre folksto the act of carnal copulation.\u201dThere are numerous cultivars. Yellow onions oftenhave golden-brown skins; red or Italian onions haveruby-red skins; white onions are white. The famoussweet and juicy Vidalia onion is named after the cityin Georgia.Why do we get all teary-eyed when we slice an onion?The cause is propanethial-S-oxide, a volatile sulfurcompound. It changes quickly to sulfuric acid, whichirritates our eyes and causes the tears. Put the onionunder water when slicing it to reduce the effect.GARLIC. This onion relative is another ancient plant.We have Egyptian inscriptions from 3200 BCE. Inthose days, garlic had a number of ceremonial uses.The Greeks and Romans ascribed magical propertiesto the plant. It was offered to the gods. Warriors ateit for added strength.  It was also tied around babiesnecks to ward off evil spirits. Its medicinal uses alsodate to ancient times. Garlic was used to treateczema, toothaches, and snake bites.SHALLOTS. Shallots are not simply baby onions. Theyare a type of slender onion with a long neck andcopper skins. They have a more delicate flavor andthey dissolve more easily in liquids during cooking.LEEKS. This plant was also used by the ancientGreeks, Romans, and Egyptians. It is sometimescalled the \u201cKing of the soup onions.\u201d CABBAGE AND ITS ALLIESWe have been eating Brassica oleracea for thousandsof years. It was a favorite of the Greeks and Romans.The Emperor Claudius once asked the Senate of Rometo confirm that corned beef and cabbage was indeedthe best dinner dish.  Its wild ancestor may still befound along the coasts of Great Britain and Europe.Today cabbages are cultivated in almost everycountry, from the Arctic to the subtropics. This singlespecies is the source of an amazing variety of leaf,stem, and root crops. Some yield edible leaves, as inkale and collards; kohlrabi is an aerial stem;broccoli and cauliflower are edible leafy buds andimmature flower clusters, respectively. Headcabbage is essentially a large bud made up ofnumerous broad leaves. It is about 91% water, alongwith some lime salts and proteins. Slaw is merelyuncooked cabbage. In this form it is not too easilydigested and it is often boiled or steamed. We also eatpartially decomposed cabbage leaves in the form ofsauerkraut.Cabbage has a characteristic odor when cooked. Atabout the point when the leaves begin to soften, theygive off hydrogen sulfide. This is the smell that weassociate with rotten eggs and sewer gases. -66-OTHER EDIBLE LEAVESARUGULA. Also known as rocket, Eruca sativa is amember of the mustard family. It is native to Eurasia.I have added it to the syllabus because arugula isshowing up in our markets, especially in the fancysalad mixes. For a long time, its bitter, peppery flavorwas not that popular with Americans. The ancientGreeks and Romans enjoyed arugula. They ate it asan aphrodisiac, to balance the \u201cdampening\u201d effect oflettuce. Arugula adorned statues of Priapus, son ofAphrodite and Dionysus, and himself the Greek god offertility. He was also the protector of gardens andherbs.LETTUCE. Lactuca sativa, a member of the sunflowerfamily, is derived from the weedy wild lettuce (L.serriola) that is native to southern Europe and Asia.As in the cabbages, lettuce is another ancient plant.Early on it was used for a variety of medicinalpurposes. The leaves contain alcohols that have asoporific effect.  Lettuce is 95% water; it has littlefood value. Several hundred cultivars are now in use.RHUBARB. Rheum rhabarbaratum is native to Asia.It is one of the very few food plants in which we eatthe leaf stalk (petiole) and throw everything elseaway. Many people mistakenly believe that the edibleportion is the stem and that the leaf is poisonous. It isthe leaf stalk that is edible and the leaf blade thatmust be discarded. The petiole is about 95% water,along with citric and malic acids. The blade containsoxalic acids, soluble oxalates, and other toxicsubstances in high enough concentrations to causepoisoning and even death in humans.CELERY. Apium graveolens, a member of the carrotfamily, is native to coastal marshes in Eurasia. Itsearly history is that of a medicinal plant, touted as acure for impotence, hangovers, constipation, and forits diuretic effects. Plants contain a family of chemicalscalled psoralens, that can cause severe allergicreactions in sensitive individuals. It is an occupationalhazard among celery pickers.SPINACH. Spinacia oleracea is probably the mostcommonly consumed of the \"greens.\" Spinach isnative to Southwest Asia. It was first cultivated inPersia, thousands of years ago. It came to Europe viathe Arab world. Italians are said to be especially fondof spinach, which gives rise to the phrase a laflorentine, which means a dish made with spinach.The amount of soluble oxalate in its tissues can behigh enough to cause poisoning under improperdietary conditions.  About half of the U. S. crop isgrown here in California; Texas is the other leadingproducer.NEW ZEALAND SPINACH. Tetragonia tetra-gonioides is a member of the ice plant family and notat all related to spinach. It is native to the islands ofthe Pacific and to New Zealand. It was named byCaptain Cook when he was in that part of the world in1771. Here in California, you will encounter this plantas a weedy escape along the coast.EDIBLE AERIAL STEMSASPARAGUS. Asparagus officinalis, a member of thelily family, is native to the eastern Mediterranean. Itsyoung shoots, spears, are typically boiled or steamed. It has been a favorite food plant since the time of theancient Greeks and Romans. Originally it was amedicinal plant, eaten for its diuretic effects. Our mostpopular cultivar, \u201cMary Washington,\u201d was developedby the U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. Asparagus has otheruses. Its seeds have been used as a coffee substituteand its stems for paper-making.And then, there is that little problem associated witheating asparagus. As Lemery noted in 1702, \u201cTheycause a filthy and disagreeable Smell in the Urine, asevery Body knows.\u201d As it turns out, some of ussecrete this smelly urine, and some of us do not.Perhaps it was under genetic control. It now appearsthat all of us make this sulfur-containing compound(methyl mercaptan), but we vary in our ability todetect it. In other words, this explains why some ofyou know what I am talking about in this paragraphand others are scratching their heads.Caesar Augustus defined haste as \u201cquicker than youcan cook asparagus.\u201dFLOWER CLUSTERS/HEADSARTICHOKE. Cynara scolymus is native to theMediterranean and to the Canary Islands. Today it iswidely planted and grows best along sea coasts. Theplant is a member of the thistle tribe of the sunflowerfamily. The edible portion is a head of tiny flowerssurrounded by a series of bracts, modified leaves. Welike to eat a coating found on the bracts and theartichoke heart, the tissue to which the immatureflowers are attached. When the artichoke was firstgrown, it was the regular foliage leaves that wereconsumed. The plant has little food value. It has beensuggested that, \"Eating an artichoke is like getting toknow someone really well!\"CARDOON. A close relative of the artichoke is thecardoon (Cynara cardunculus). The blanched leavesare the edible part of this plant. They are covered withblack plastic bags or with newspaper to keep out thesunlight. The pale green leaves are typically harvestedin the fall. They taste like artichoke x asparagus xsalsify. CAULIFLOWER. Brassica oleracea var. botrytis is anOld World plant, probably native to the Near East. Wehave been eating cauliflower for at least 2500 years.It reached the U. S. in the 17th century, being grownfirst in Long Island, New York. The edible portion, the curd, is a mass of undevelopedflower buds that are attached to branches that are, inturn, from a central stalk. They come in white, green,and purple. The surrounding leaves are used to coverthe curd in the cvs. that will be white. Cutting off thesunlight prevents chlorophyll and other pigments fromforming. The curd may be eaten raw or cooked.Broccoflower is a cauliflower x broccoli hybrid.As Mark Twain noted, \"Cauliflower is nothing morethan cabbage with a college education.\"-67-EDIBLE FLOWERS, LEAVES, AND AERIAL STEMSCommon Name (Scientific Name) Family Commentsartichoke (Cynara scolymus) Sunflower Domesticated in Mediterraneanarugula (Eruca vesicaria) Mustard Pungent leaves; Mediterraneanasparagus (Asparagus officinalis) Lily Native to Mediterraneanbamboo (Bambusa and other genera) Grass Young shoots widely usedbroccoli (Brassica oleracea) Mustard Stems, lvs, and flws usedBrussel sprouts (Brassica oleracea) Mustard Leafy buds eatencabbage, Chinese (Brassica oleracea) Mustard Primarily Oriental cropcabbage, common (Brassica oleracea) Mustard In use for 8000 yearscabbage palm (various genera) Palm Central leafy bud eatencardoon (Cynara cardunculus) Sunflower Blanched leaves eatencauliflower (Brassica oleracea) Mustard Immature flower cluster eatencelery (Apium graveolens) Carrot Domesticated in Mediterraneanchard (Beta vulgaris var. cicla) Goosefoot Beet relative without swollen rootchervil (Anthriscus cerefolium) Carrot Native to Europe and Near EastChinese-spinach (Amaranthus tricolor) Pigweed Long use in Orientchives (Allium schoenoprasum) Lily Native to Old Worldcollards (Brassica oleracea) Mustard Southern U.

MAJOR CEREALS\u201cAll flesh is grass.\u201d (Book of Isaiah, 40:6)\u201cNo civilization worthy of the name has ever beenfounded on any agricultural basis other than thecereals.\u201d      (Paul Mangelsdorf)INTRODUCTIONThe great civilizations, past and present, have beenbased upon agriculture. These agricultural systems, inturn, have been founded upon a handful of cereals orgrains. Those of the Near and Middle East, notablythose of Greece, Rome, and Egypt, were basedprimarily on wheat; as were those of Europe and laterNorth America. The well-developed agriculture of theMaya, Aztecs, and Incas rested on maize. The greatsocieties of China, India, and the Far East were basedupon rice. While all of the great civilizations cultivatedmany different kinds of plants for a variety ofpurposes, it is almost impossible to overestimate theimportance of the cereals. We devote 70% of ourfarmland to growing cereals and we derive about 50%of our calories from them. As a group they are,without question, the most important source of ourfood and they have been throughout our entirecultural history.WHY SO IMPORTANT? There are several features ofcereals that make them useful to us. They areannuals, which means that we can rely on getting acrop in a relatively short time. They are also adaptableand efficient producers of food. The yield perhectare/acre is high. Cereals are very nutritious.Grains can be easily harvested, cleaned, andprocessed.NUTRITIONAL VALUE. The cereal grain contains acarbohydrate-rich tissue called endosperm, whichserves as food for the germinating embryo. Theembryo itself contains oils and about 8-15 % protein.Vitamins and minerals are also present. The aminoacids cysteine and methionine occur at levelsadequate to meet our needs. Other amino acids,notably lysine and tryptophan, may be insufficient,depending on the cereal consumed. See the tablebelow for amino acid content. Cereals are alsodeficient in calcium and Vitamin C.TRUE AND FALSE  CEREALSAll of the true cereals belong to the grass family. Itis common to recognize maize (corn), rice, and wheatas the major cereals. Barley, rye, and oats are thebetter known minor cereals. In addition to the truecereals is an artificial group of plants called the falsecereals. They are characterized by small, grain-likefruits. Sunflower and buckwheat \"seeds\" are perhapsthe best known examples.The most important part of the cereal plant is its seed-like fruit, the caryopsis. It is more commonly knownas a grain or a berry. It contains a single seed whoseouter coat is fused to the inner wall of the fruit. Theouter layer of the grain (ovary wall and seed coat) areoften called bran; the embryo within the grain is thegerm. Hulled and crushed grains are called groats.The caryopsis is found within a very complicatedstructure called a spikelet. It is a highly modified andreduced flower system. The spikelet is composed of acentral stalk, a series of tiny overlapping bracts, andvery small flowers. Some spikelets, as in those of therice plant, may yield only one grain; those of oats willproduce more than one. The caryopsis is typicallyenclosed by two bracts, the palea and lemma. Incommon parlance they are called hulls. These bractsmay be fused to the grain or free from it. This is nota trivial matter when it comes to the processing of thecereal grains.WHEATTriticum aestivum is most widely cultivated crop plant.It is the second oldest cereal, after barley.Archeological remains dating to 6700 B. P. have beenfound in Jarmo, Iraq. These were relatively primitivewheats. But, even the advanced bread wheat is knownfrom 5000 BCE. from the Nile Valley. Wheat wasbrought to the New World by the Spanish in 1529. Ithas been in cultivated in the United States since about1602.Today there are literally tens of thousands of cultivarsof wheat. They are classified informally as follows:Winter wheats are planted in the fall, remaindormant during the winter, and then mature in theearly summer. Winter wheats are grown in the UnitedStates from Texas to South Dakota. Spring wheat is planted in the spring and maturesthat same summer. It is adapted for growing seasonsas short as 90 days. Spring wheat is grown in thenorthern regions of the U. S. and Canada. It is arehardy as far north as the Arctic Circle.Hard wheat has a protein content of 13-16%, morethan does soft wheat. It is typically used to make longlasting breads. These cultivars are usually grown inareas of low rainfall. Soft wheat grains have about 8-11% protein andthey are  often used for pastries and breads that willbe consumed quickly, such as French bread. They aregrown in more humid regions.One of the popular cereals is bulgur wheat. Itconsists of kernels that have been steamed, dried,and then crushed. In that sense, it is a kind of crackedwheat; but not all cracked wheat is bulgur wheat. It isa staple in the Middle East countries. We also see it insalads, such as tabbouleh.Semolina is made from very hard strains of durumwheat. Its flour is tough and it will not become astarchy paste when cooked. Bakery products madefrom it tend to be of a light texture. It is also used tomake a variety of puddings.Kamut is a relative of durum wheat. The name comesfrom the ancient Egyptian name for wheat. Its grainsare two or three times larger than regular wheat, itsprotein content much higher, and it also containssignificant amounts of other nutrients. Look for it inhippie food stores; otherwise it is not commonlyencountered.SPECIES OF WHEAT (TRITICUM)There are about 14-16 commonly recognized speciesof wheat. They fall easily into three groups, differing-69-in chromosome number and morphology. In Triticum,x = 7. Two of the wheats are diploid (2x = 14); eightare tetraploids (4x = 28); and six are hexaploids (6x= 42). A more detailed summary is presented below.The diploids and tetraploids are of little economicimportance, except for durum or macaroni wheat.Species (common name) Chromosome SetDiploids [2n = 2x = 14]:T. boeoticum (wild einkorn) AAT. monococcum (einkorn) AATetraploids [2n = 4x = 28]:T. dicoccoides (wild emmer wheat) AABBT. dicoccon (emmer wheat) AABBT. durum (durum or macaroni) AABBT. turgidum (poulard or rivet) AABBT. polonicum (Polish wheat) AABBT. carthlicum (Persian wheat) AABBT. timopheevii (Timopheevi wheat) AAGGT. araraticum AAGGHexaploids [2n = 6x = 42]:T. spelta (spelt wheat) AABBDDT. macha (macha wheat) AABBDDT. vavilovii (Vavilov's wheat) AABBDDT. compactum (club wheat) AABBDDT. sphaerococcum (shot wheat) AABBDDT. aestivum (bread wheat) AABBDD* This summary is modified after Simmons, N. W. (editor).1976. Evolution of crop plants. Longman. London, England.P. 121. The nomenclature for the various wheat speciesfollows Terrell, et al. (1986).EVOLUTION OF BREAD WHEATAs you can see from this table, bread wheat and itsimmediate relatives are hexaploids; they have sixcomplete sets of chromosomes. Each set containsseven chromosomes. Further inspection will show thatthe six sets are not six different sets, but three ofthem (A, B, & D) in duplicate. In other words, breadwheat contains three different genomes, eachrepresented twice. The evolutionary process that ledto our modern day bread wheat began with a natural,spontaneous crossing of a wild einkorn wheat with akind of goat grass (Aegilops speltoides) that occurredin the same area. Both were diploids (2x = 14). Thisprimitive wheat is the source of the A genome inmodern bread wheat; the goat grass is the donor ofthe B genome. The hybrid that resulted from thenatural crossings would be designated AB and it wasat least partially sterile because of the differences inthe chromosomes in the A and B sets (genomes).Eventually, by a procedure in which unreducedgametes (egg and sperm nuclei that have twice asmany chromosomes as they ought to have) combine,the chromosome complement in these primitivehybrids doubled. The result was wild emmer wheatwith 28 chromosomes (AABB). The inhabitants of theNear East domesticated this grass and used it alongwith einkorn wheat.A few thousand years later, a domesticated form ofemmer wheat crossed spontaneously with a secondkind of goat grass (Aegilops squarrosa). It has beenidentified as the source of the D genome in modernbread wheat. Again, the immediate result of thishybridization was a sterile grass with three genomes(ABD) and a chromosome number of 21. The union ofunreduced gametes would eventually yield offspringthat were AABBDD.Here is the same explanation, this time in the form ofa diagram.PHASE I:  DIPLOID TO TETRAPLOIDTriticum boeoticum Aegilops speltoides(wild einkorn wheat) (goat grass)[2n = 2x = 14] X [2n = 2x = 14][genome: AA] [genome: BB]?Sterile First Generation Hybrid[2n = 2x = 14][genomes: AB]?Unreduced Gametes(\"chromosome doubling\")?Triticum dicoccoides(wild emmer wheat)[2n = 4x = 28][genomes: AABB]?Domestication??Triticum dicoccum(cultivated emmer wheat)[2n = 4x = 28][genomes: AABB]PHASE II:  TETRAPLOID TO HEXAPLOIDTriticum dicoccum Aegilops squarrosa(cultivated emmer wheat) (goat grass)[2n = 4x = 28] X [2n = 2x = 14][genomes: AABB] [genomes: DD]?Sterile Hybrid[2n = 3x = 21][genomes: ABD]?Unreduced Gametes(\"chromosome doubling\")?Triticum aestivum(bread wheat)[2n = 6x = 42][genomes: AABBDD]?Domestication?Hulled/free-threshing cultivars?Recent domestication/genetic engineeringBREAD MAKING\u201cThere is not a thing which is more positive thanbread.\u201d (Feodor Dostoyevsky)\u201cThinkst thou such force in bread?\u201d (John Milton)\"Everything is food, but bread is the great mother.\" (Hindu scripture)\"Bread made from wheat, as compared with thatmade from barley, is more nourishing, more digestible-70-and in every way supe(rSioiprh.\"ilis of Siphonos, 100 BCE)\"Wheat is stronger and more nourishing than barley,but both it and its gruel are less laxative. Bread madeof it without separating the bran dries and passes,when cleaned from the bran it nourishes more, but isless laxative.\" (Hippocrates, ca. 400 BCE)' ' ' ' 'HISTORY. As Hindu scripture suggests, bread isclearly one of our most important foods. Threecommon English words also speak to its significance.A \"lord\" is the keeper of the loaf; a \"lady\" is thekneader of the loaf; a \"companion\" is a person withwhom we eat bread.To most of us, bread is a dough made from wheatflour and water that is baked in an oven. A broaderdefinition recognizes that bread may be made fromcarbohydrate sources other than wheat and that itmay be deep-fried, cooked on a griddle, or poachedand then baked, in the case of the bagel. Bread is anancient foodstuff, older than our recorded history. Inits earliest form, bread was probably a gooey doughof wild cereal grains mixed with water. It evolved outof more watery gruels, grouts, or porridges. Thegrains had been beaten between two rocks to crackthem. The mass was parched and then formed intoflat cakes that could be cooked on hot stones.Crushing and parching also separated the grain itselffrom hulls that adhered to it. The domestication ofwheat brought about a critical improvement --varieties that could be easily husked.About 6000 years ago, the Egyptians discovered thatuncooked dough would begin to bubble and to give offa characteristic sour smell if left alone for a few hours.When cooked, this version of dough made a lighter,more palatable leavened bread. They quickly foundthat a small piece of the soured dough would producethis same effect in freshly made dough. So didsoaking crushed wheat grains in white wine for aboutthree days. The relationship between brewing andbread making has always been an intimate one. TheEgyptians became master bread makers, addinghoney, eggs, and various aromatic substances to theircreations. They formed the dough into a loaves ofvarious shapes and baked them in a ovens of theirown design. They were a two-chambered oven,shaped like a bee hive. The fire was maintained in thelower compartment and the baking occurred in theupper section.The Greeks and Romans were also skilled bakers.Because they drank wine, fermented grape juice wastheir source of yeast. Pliny noted, however, that thebarbarians in Spain and France who were beerdrinkers managed to make a lighter loaf of bread byusing scrapings from the beer vats. The Romansdeveloped the first rotary mill powered by animals, byslaves, or by running water. A thousand years later,Europeans would adopt an Arab invention, thewindmill. Cereal grains were crushed between astationary lower mill stone and an upper one thatrotated. Milling does two things. It separates theendosperm from the bran (the outer layers of thegrain) and from the germ (the oily embryo). It alsoreduces the starchy endosperm to a fine powder, theflour. Flour comes from the same root word as\"flower,\" meaning that it is the best part of the grain.The Romans were probably the first to establishcommercial bakeries. Large stone bowls with woodenpaddles to mix and knead dough allowed largequantities of dough to be processed. Knowledge ofthese techniques spread with the Roman army. By theway, since the days of the ancient Greeks and Romanswhite bread made from refined flour has beenconsidered far superior to the coarser, darker breads.The upper class has eaten white bread; the poorer folkand those in prison ate unleavened bread made frombarley, oats, or rye.The invention of the steam engine by James Watt in1769 allowed for significant technologicaladvancements. In 1834, Jacob Sulzburger developedthe steam-powered milling machine that used steelrollers. In 1870, Edmund La Croix invented a way ofseparating the middlings (bran, germ, and othercoarse materials) from the starchy endosperm. Rollerscracked the cereal grain, rather than crushing it. Thegrains were then passed through a series of screens ofincreasingly finer mesh. Air currents blew awayimpurities; the bran and germ were also sifted off.BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY. When the ancientEgyptians noticed that soured dough gave off bubblesand a particular smell, they were observing theactivity of air-borne, wild yeasts that had gotten intothe dough and were now carrying out their lifeprocesses. Yeasts are microscopic, one-celled fungi.The particular species that is important in breadmaking is the same one used in brewing,Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The name translatesroughly as \"brewer's sugar fungus.\" The yeast cellsconvert the starchy endosperm in the dough to carbondioxide and alcohol. The chemical process is starch --> glucose --> 2 pyruvic acid --> 2 CO2 + 2 ethylalcohol. The carbon dioxide is trapped in the doughand forms gas pockets. Baking the dough increasedthe generation of carbon dioxide. The alcohol (ethanolor ethyl alcohol) escapes from the baking bread andexplains, at least partially, the characteristic aromathat we find so pleasing. Of course, at a certain stageduring baking, the temperature rises to a point atwhich the yeasts are killed. One pound of doughcontains about three billion yeast cells. Did theysuffer?All carbohydrate sources will be worked on by theyeast cells in the same fashion. One cereal grain,wheat, is especially well suited to bread makingbecause it contains two proteins, glutenin andgliadin, that combine when moistened to form anelastic substance called gluten. When wheat dough iskneaded, gluten will absorb up to twice its weight inwater and it will form a three dimensional mesh ormatrix that traps carbon dioxide and stabilizes it.Otherwise, the raised dough would collapse at somepoint during the baking process. Kneading strengthensthe gluten structure, increasing its ability to stretch.When you purchase lighter, fluffier breads made fromrye or some other grain, these have wheat flour inthem to impart this feature. This special feature ofwheat helps to explain why breadmaking was not animportant aspect of life in regions where ricepredominates or starchy root crops are the primarycarbohydrate source.The production of carbon dioxide by yeast cells is notthe only mechanism for making raised or leavenedbreads. Much later, we discovered that ash made froma hardwood, when soaked in water, would yieldcarbon dioxide when heated. This hardwood ash is, forall practical purposes, lye. In the last century, bakingsoda was developed. It is sodium bicarbonate(NaHCO3), an alkaline substance that imparts anunpleasant taste to the bread unless it was neutralizedby an acid of some sort. Buttermilk and fruit juiceshave been traditional sources. French bread is madefrom milk, butter, and beer leavening. Baking powder,sodium bicarbonate combined with cream of tartar to-71-supply the acidic neutralizer, was developed in the1840's. The chemical process is sodium bicarbonate +tartaric acid --> sodium tartrate + water + carbondioxide. In 1855, packaged baking soda, cream oftartar, and cornstarch to absorb excess moisture wasdeveloped. In 1867, Charles and MaximillianFleischmann, two Austrian bakers, started the yeast-making industry in the United States. Yeast cells weregrown in a sugar solution. Then excess water wasremoved and the yeast was mixed with starch,compressed into cakes, and packed in balsa woodboxes. Dry yeast cakes, developed during World WarII, became available for widespread use after 1945.European scientists had also developed the techniquesneeded to grow particular strains of yeasts for avariety of special purposes, including those of thebaker.The flour that we use today is typically bleached andaged. Bleaching yields the uniform white color thatmany of us find aesthetically appealing. Chlorinedioxide is often the bleaching agent. If you allow flourto sit around, the oxygen in the atmosphere willaccomplish the same result. Unbleached flour has ayellow cast to it, the result of pigments calledxanthophylls. Various products made from semolinawheat, such as pastas, use unbleached flour. Thebleaching process also destroys small amounts ofVitamin E. \"Aged\" or \"improved\" flour has betterbaking qualities. Aging allows important changes ingluten to occur.You might think that bread making is a dull,noncontroversial subject. You would be wrong! In1861, Eben Horsford, a Harvard professor (there-fore,immediately suspect) warned that yeast cells werepoisonous molds and should not be used. After all,they were microbes -- germs. Instead, he suggesteda baking powder made from lime and sodiumphosphate, both of which are found in the humanbody. At about the same time, a pamphlet wasdistributed that argued that the bread of the day was\"... rotted by fermentation or poisoned with acids andalkalis, [so that] the staff of life has well become thestaff of death.\" The so-called Boston Water Cure urgeduse of an oven that was so hot that dough would bepuffed up by the sudden expansion of air andvaporized water. The result was a loaf of bread thatwas amazingly dense and unpopular. In the 19thcentury, there was also concern abut the adulterationof bakers' bread with alum, chalk, and ground uphuman bones!WHITE OR BROWN BREAD? A rephrasing of thequote from Hippocrates cited above suggests thatbrown bread has a laxative effect on us and that whitebread is more nutritious. This is consistent with a viewespoused by the ancient Greeks and Romans -- whitebread is better than brown bread made from wholewheat grains or from grains other than wheat. Thisopinion persisted, more or less unchallenged, until the19th century. The Reverend Sylvester Graham and Dr.John Harvey Kellogg, inventor of the Graham Crackerand one of the brothers who founded Kellogg Cereals,were vocal advocates of the superiority of whole graincereals. Graham wrote that separating the endospermfrom the bran was akin to \"... put[ting] asunder whatGod has joined together....\" Kellogg focused hisattention on the laxative effects of the brancomponent. He believed that we ought to have threeor more bowel movements each day to prevent thebuild up of intestinal poisons.The views of Graham and Kellogg gained credibilitywith the appearance of studies in the 1970's ondietary fiber. These suggested that the higher theintake of these indigestible cell wall components, thelower the risk of intestinal disorders, hemorrhoids, andcancer of the colon and rectum. Brown bread hasmore nutrients in it than white bread and it clearly hasa higher fiber content. The irony is that, \"... becausethe cellulosic material of the bran cannot be digestedand tends to speed the passage of food through thehuman digestive tract, the total nutritive contributionof whole wheat flour is less than that found inenriched white flour products.\" (Pomeranz, 1973)RICE\u201cGrain upon grain, fresh and delightful as frosta dazzling jewelto what can I compare this treasure?\u201d (Yang Ji, Ming Dynasty poet)There are 20-25 species in the genus Oryza, but onlytwo are of economic significance. Asian rice,  Oryzasativa, is the principal food for about 60% of theworld's population. There is some question as to itsnativity. Some experts say it is native to India; othersto southwest China or southeast Asia. It has beencultivated in southeast Asia for at least 7000 years.Sealed pots of rice 8000 years old have been found inChina. Literally thousands of cultivars have beendeveloped, 8000 of them in India alone. Asian ricewas introduced into America in 1647. Oryzaglaberrima, red rice or African rice, is native to Africaand has been used locally there for about 3500 years.Unlike wheat, most kinds of rice are diploid (2n = 2x= 24). It is usually grown in a swampy field known asa paddy. This helps to explain why so much rice israised in the monsoon belt where heavy seasonalrainfall is used. In most instances, rice seeds are notplanted directly in the paddies. Instead there arenurseries where seedlings are started and thentransferred. The seedlings are planted in smallbunches, each clump about 4-16\" from the next one.Most cultivated strains require flooding, this beingaccomplished by taking advantage of the monsoonsand by the skillful manipulation of dikes in thepaddies. There are also cultivars called upland ricesthat can be grown in drier fields.At maturity, most rice plants are 4-6 ft. tall; somedeep water varieties reach 20 ft. Once the plants haveflowered, the water level is reduced and finally thesupply is shut off entirely and the fields allowed todry. When the plants begin to wither, it is time toharvest the crop. In the Old World, the harvesting andthreshing processes are done by hand. In the U.S. andother technologically advanced countries, much of thisis done by machine. In this country, Arkansas,Louisiana, Mississippi, and California are the main ricegrowing states.KINDS OF RICE. We commonly recognize three typesof rice based upon the length of the grain: long:tropical rices; not too soft nor starchy; grains 7-8 mmlong, the length prized by the connoisseur; medium:commonly grown in the U. S.; somewhat softer;grains averaging about 6.6 mm long; short: grown inthe more northern climates, often planted in Japan;even more starchy; grains averaging about 5.5 mmlong.Rice cultivars vary in the \u201cstickiness\u201d of their grains.This is a function of the proportion of amylose andamylopectin, two types of starch. The higher theamylopectin, the stickier the rice. The range is about70% in the least sticky to about 83% in the stickiest.-72-Brown rice has not had its nutrient-rich outer layersremoved during processing. In other words, it has notbeen pearled or polished. Given its nutritionalsuperiority, why do we eat white rice? Because brownrice is harder to cook, tougher, not as sticky, goesrancid more rapidly, is more susceptible to insects,and has been considered aesthetically inferior to whiterice since ancient times.Converted rice has been steeped, steamed, anddried before it is milled. The technique was developedabout 2000 years ago in India and Pakistan. Severalchanges occur, including diffusion of Vit. B from thebran and germ into the endosperm.In the 1904 World\u2019s Fair, Quaker oats introducedpuffed rice, the \u201ccereal that was shot from guns.\u201dThey used a canon from the Spanish-American War!Today\u2019s puffed rice is prepared in pressure cookers,with the pressure released at the last minute to puffthe rice.Basmati rice was originally grown in the foothills ofthe Himalayas, where it has been used for thousandsof years.  It is a long-grained rice that is aged toreduce moisture content. Basmati rice is particularlypopular in Middle Eastern and Indian markets. Thegrains are yellow and have a characteristic sweet,nutty aroma and flavor.NUTRITIVE VALUE. The intact grain is a good sourceof iron, calcium, magnesium, selenium, vitamin E, theB vitamins, and an essential fatty acid, alpha linoleicacid. However, people who subsist on polished rice aremore likely to suffer from beriberi, brought on by adeficiency in vitamin B1 (thiamine). Sensory nervesare affected, starting with the feet and workingupward in the body. In one form of the disease,congestive heart failure occurs.MAIZE OR CORN\u201c... a sort of grain they called maiz which was welltasted, bak\u2019d, dry\u2019d and made into flour.\u201d(Christopher Columbus, 5 November 1492)\u201cThis Corne is a marveilous strange plante, nothingresembling any other kinde of grayne.\u201d (H. Lyte, 1578)' ' ' ' 'First, a word about the common name of Zea mays. Inthis country, we usually call this plant corn or Indiancorn. Maize is a better common name (and a perfectlylegitimate one) because corn is used by other English-speaking peoples around the world for what we wouldcall wheat, oats, or as a generic term for cerealgrains. This explains the use of the word \u201ccorn\u201d in theHebrew Bible and other ancient texts, since what wecall corn would have been unknown to them.There are three features of maize that make itdifferent from wheat, rice, or any other cereal. It isthe only important cereal that is native to the NewWorld. Second, maize as we known it today isconsiderably different in appearance from its wildancestors. The progenitors of the other cereals arebasically the same in general appearance as theirmodern derivatives. Maize is strikingly distinct. Andthird, maize is unique among the major cereals inhaving separate male and female flowers borne onentirely different parts of the plant. The male flowersare found on the branches of the tassel, while thefemale flowers are clustered in the ear, the complexfruiting structure that bears an even number of rowsof caryopses, or kernels as they are commonly called.Maize has many uses. In this country, about 90% ofthe crop goes into livestock food. In many othercountries, maize is a very important food for humans.It is inferior to wheat and to some other cereals in itsprotein content. This means that maize flour productsare less tasty than those made from rye or wheat.Maize flour, however, has been the mainstay of manypeoples in Central and South America. Hominy isdried, hulled maize kernels that are cooked in variousways. The word comes from the Algonquian language.Hominy was one of the first Native American foodsthat was accepted by the early European settlers inthe 17th century. Lime (the mineral, not the fruit) orlye (from wood ash) is used to help loosen the hulls.Grits is made from finely ground hominy. It issometimes called hominy grits. Look for it south of theMason and Dixon Line. I discovered many years agoon my first collecting trip into the South that gritswere served with just about anything that youordered, especially for breakfast.Other important products from maize include cornstarch, corn oil, alcoholic beverages, and silage. Asone author noted, maize is with us from cradle tograve \u2013 literally. It is in baby powder and in embalming fluid!TYPES OF MAIZEThere are six main types of maize in use today:flint: kernel made of hard starch; in use by NativeAmericans at the time of Columbus; widely used in thenorthern corn belt;dent: kernel of hard starch, capped by soft starchthat dries to leave a small depression in the top of thegrain; economically the most important maize; muchused in the corn belt;flour: kernel consists almost entirely of soft starch;used by the Native Americans of the Southwest andthose in South America for hand grinding;sweet: kernels with high sugar content, consumedwhile immature; most widely grown for humanconsumption here and in Europe;pop: kernels lacking soft starch, cells burst uponheating because of high water content of central cells;related to flint corn;pod: peculiar type with comparatively little economicimportance; kernel enclosed by bracts; considered bysome to be the ancestor of modern maize.THE RELATIVES OF MAIZEMaize has two close relatives -- gama grass andteosinte. There are about seven species of gamagrasses (Tripsacum spp.), found from the centralportion of the U. S. to southern Brazil. All of them areperennials. The male and female flowers are separatefrom one another, as in maize, but they are not in thetassel and ear configuration.There are three kinds of teosinte, all occurring inMexico and Central America. Traditionally, teosintehas been placed in its own genus (Euchlaena), but inmore recent works the species have been put in Zea.The male flowers are borne in a tassel at the top ofthe plant; the female flowers are borne on a spike on-73-the lower parts of the plant.THE ORIGIN OF MODERN MAIZEFor much of the last century, the identity of the grassthat gave rise to maize has been the subject of muchcontroversy. Most of the botanists and geneticist whostudied the matter belonged to one of two camps.They are either teosinte people, followers of GeorgeBeadle, or pod corn people, followers of PaulMangelsdorf and Richard Reeves. Those who believethat teosinte was the ancestor of modern maize pointout how easily it can be crossed with maize. They notethat the conversion of the hard bracts surrounding thegrains on the teosinte \"ear\" into soft structures wouldproduce a maize-like ear. Hugh Iltis, a botanist at theUniv. of Wisconsin, has suggested that it was theconversion of male flowers, with their softer bracts,that was actually involved.The more widely held view was that modern maizeoriginated from a wild form of pod corn and that thevariety that we see today in maize is the result of pasthybridization between Zea and Tripsacum, the gamagrasses. According to the \"Pod Corn Theory,\" teosinteis not a maize ancestor at all, but the result of naturalcrosses between maize and gama grasses.The results of the archeological, botanical, and geneticresearch into the origin of maize suggest thefollowing:' Maize is native to the New World, moreparticularly to Mesoamerica. Reports of Pre-Columbian maize from the Old World have notbeen substantiated.' Domestication of maize began about 10,000 BP.' The ancestor of maize is teosinte, its closestrelative.' Teosinte is not a hybrid of maize and gama grass.' Gama grass may have crossed with someprimitive forms of maize and thereby contributedto the evolution of modern kinds of maize.' Primitive maize became extinct because it couldnot compete against more successful cultivatedforms and perhaps because of the introduction ofgrazing animals by the Spanish after theConquest.The Beadle school won and the pod corn people, thefollowers of Paul Mangelsdorf, lost the long battle. Hewas generous in defeat.HYBRID MAIZEOne of the great developments in modern agriculturalgenetics is hybrid corn. The basic principle behindhybrid corn is that stable inbred lines can be crossedwith one another to produce more uniform plants withhigher yields. Modern hybrid corn involves a doublecrossing. During the first year, inbred strain A iscrossed with B. Self-pollination is prevented duringthese crosses by removing the male flowers from onestrain (detasseling), thereby rendering the plantseffectively female. In separate fields, strains C and Dare similarly crossed. The seeds from the A x B andfrom the C x D crosses are planted. These mature intoAB and CD individuals. These are then crossed duringthe second year, yielding the double cross ABCDhybrid seed. It is planted the third year to producetremendous yields of high-quality seed. The ABCDseed is not true-breeding and must, therefore, bepurchased regularly.CYTOPLASMIC MALE STERILITYIn 1938, Paul Mangelsdorf, a Harvard botanist whodevoted his life to the study of maize, discovered asweet corn variety in Texas that was male sterile. Themale flowers of its tassel had shriveled anthers thatdid not produce fertile pollen grains. Investigation ofthis plant revealed that the sterility was under geneticcontrol, as opposed to some short-lived environmentalproblem, such as drought. Sterile sex cells typicallyresult from chromosomal abnormalities, either in theirnumber or structure. However, in this case the cornplant produced sterile pollen when a sterility factor [S]in the cytoplasm of the cell was present at the sametime that it had a double recessive gene [rf] in itsnucleus. This same kind of phenomenon was firstfound in onions, and is now known to occur in severalcrop plants. One possible explanation is that thecytoplasmic sterility is caused by viruses that cansurvive only if the rf rf condition exists. If the gene ispresent in the Rf state, fertility is restored. Cytoplasmwithout the sterility factor is designated N, for\"normal.\" The cytoplasmic factor passes from onegeneration to the next only via the egg.Therefore, by using an inbred line that contains the Srf rf genetic combination, male sterile plants areproduced. The corn plants are rendered functionallyfemale. The difficulty in finding enough workers andtheir cost made the male-sterile strains a veryattractive alternative to manual detasseling. Withintwenty years, practically all of the maize grown in theUnited States incorporated the male sterility factorfirst found in the Texas corn plants. Once again we had made one of our major crop plantsmore genetically similar to one another, with all of theadvantages and disadvantages associated with thatuniformity. The bill came due in the summer of 1970.Our corn fields were invaded by a fungus(Helminthosporium maydis), which causes thesouthern leaf blight. The disease spread rapidly,moving from Florida northward at about 150 km perday. By the end of the summer, the blight hadcovered much of the eastern and central UnitedStates. It devastated the Texas male-sterile hybrids,causing more than a $1 billion loss in the corn crop.\u201cJUMPING GENES\u201dJames Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize withFrancis Crick for their discovery of the structure ofDNA, said, \u201cThere are really three main figures in thehistory of genetics -- the three M\u2019s: Mendel, Morgan,and McClintock.\u201d Gregor Johann Mendel (1822-1884),an Austrian monk, is often called the father ofgenetics. His work on the changes that he observedfrom one generation to the next in pea plants that hegrew in the monastery garden is well known --  astandard fixture in all highschool and college texts inbiology and genetics. Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866-1945), of Columbia University, along with his wife(Lillian) and his students  did research on the fruit fly(Drosophila melanogaster).  His lab was the first toshow that genes were located on chromosomes in thecell nucleus, that genes were located at specific siteson a chromosome, and that traits were passed fromparent to offspring through genes. Morgan won theNobel Prize in 1933 for these fundamental discoveries.The third \u201cM\u201d is Barbara McClintock (1902-1992). Sheearned her bachelor\u2019s degree in botany from CornellUniversity, where she was also awarded her master\u2019s-74-and doctorate. In 1931, McClintock identified the tenchromosomes of maize, and she co-authored with Harriet Creighton the first paper to describe thegenetic phenomenon of crossing-over. In 1944,McClintock identified the seven chromosomes of thebread mold, Neurospora, and began her research onmobile genes and controlling elements in maize. Shehad observed that some plants have leaves withdifferent patterns of pigment in them. In maize, somekernels were white, some solid purple, and some hadspeckles of purple on otherwise white kernels.After years of detailed study, McClintock developed atheory to explain what she had seen. The differencesin pigmentation of corn kernels was caused by somegenes moving from one site on a chromosome toanother location, or from one chromosome to another.Further, it appeared to her that other genes acted asswitches that turn a gene on and off during plantdevelopment. McClintock presented the results of herwork in 1951 at a Cold Spring Harbor Symposium. Thereaction was mixed. Most of her colleagues failed tounderstand her work, others rejected it outright, andothers thought that poor Barbara had been out in thesun too long playing with her corn plants. One said,that \u201c... he had never heard anything as ridiculous.\u201dAnother, \u201cI understand that you\u2019re doing somethingthat\u2019s very strange. I don\u2019t want to hear a word aboutit.\u201d At the other end of the spectrum, thedistinguished Caltech geneticist Alfred Sturtevant said,\u201cI didn\u2019t understand one word she said, but if she saysit is so, it must be so!\u201dWhat Barbara McClintock had proposed was heresy!Everyone knew that a chromosome was like anecklace and the beads were genes. This bead isalways next to that bead in a necklace; this gene isalways next to that gene on a chromosome. And shewas saying that it ain\u2019t necessarily so. In her nowclassic paper, McClintock concluded that the bestexplanation for what she was seeing was that a genedid, in fact, actually move from one site on achromosome to the site of the gene that controlledpigment color. She called it  Ds, the dissociator gene.Ds would instruct the color gene. The Ds gene, inturn, was controlled by an activator, Ac.McClintock called these mobile genetic unitstransposons. Time Magazine called them \u201cjumpinggenes.\u201d It explained McClintock\u2019s theory in terms ofthree characters -- a painter, a boss, and a policeman.The painter is the structural gene that makes a kernelhave a particular color. The boss (Ds or dissociatorgene) can tell the painter to paint or not to paint. Theboss must follow the directions of the police officer (Acor activator gene), who can tell the boss to let thepainter do his job or not. The officer can tell the bossto have the painter stop and then later resumepainting. Depending on the interaction of the painter,boss, and policeman, the kernel will be pigmented,speckled, or colorless.On 10 October 1983, McClintock learned from theradio that she had won the Nobel Prize in Physiologyor Medicine. The folks in Stockholm had tried to callher at home, but she didn\u2019t have a telephone. She,Marie Curie in 1911, and Dorothy Hodgkin in 1964 arethe only three women to receive an unshared Nobel inany field.McClintock\u2019s long-time friend and champion, MarcusRhoades, said of her work:\u201cOne of the remarkable things about BarbaraMcClintock\u2019s surpassingly beautiful investigations isthat they came solely from her own labors. Withouttechnical help of any kind she has by virtue of herboundless energy, her complete devotion to science,her originality and ingenuity, and her quick and highintelligence made a series of significant discoveriesunparalleled in the history of cytogenetics. A skilledexperimentalist, a master at interpreting cytologicaldetail, a brilliant theoretician, she has had anilluminating and pervasive role in the development ofcytology and genetics.\u201dTransposable elements have since been found in manyplants and animals. They are best known in maize,fruit flies, yeasts, and humans.5.6 ! MINOR CEREALSBy convention, any true cereal other than wheat, rice,or maize is called a minor cereal. Many of them areunfamiliar to people who live outside the tropics, butin those regions they are very important food plantsfor us and for our animals.BARLEY. Hordeum vulgare is the fourth leadingcereal, in terms of world-wide production. Along withwheat, it was one of the first plants that wedomesticated. All of the cultivated species are diploids(2n = 2x = 14). Barley differs from wheat, maize, andrice in having three spikelets per node. If all threedevelop, the spike has the appearance of having sixrows of grains, three on each side (the 6-rowedbarleys); if the two lateral spikelets are rudimentary,then the spike appears to have two rows of spikelets(the 2-rowed barleys). The two bracts immediatelysurrounding the grain are fused to it. The grain ispearled, rubbed against abrasive disks to remove thehulls and some of the outer layers of the grain, duringthe processing for human consumption. The chief useof barley is as animal food. It is a relativelyunimportant food for humans. About one-third of thecrop is used for making malt used in brewing,flavoring, cereals, icings, coffee substitutes, infantfoods, flours, medicinal syrups, candies, and industrialfermentations.RYE. Secale cereale is a plant of cool, non-humidregions. It is grown chiefly in northern Europe. In theU. S., North and South Dakota and Nebraska grow themost rye. The species is diploid (2n = 2x = 14). It isnow unknown in the wild. Most rye is fed to cattle. Weuse it to make flour for \"rye bread\" or the famousblackbread (Schwartzbrot) of Germany, Poland, andRussia. Most of our U. S. ryebread has a very highwheat flour content. Rye is also used to make whiskyand industrial alcohol.Ergot (Claviceps purpurea) is an important fungalparasite of rye. It causes tremendous crop losses andpoisoning in both cattle and humans. More on thatsubject when we get to medicinal plants.SORGHUM. The U. S. is the leading producer ofSorghum bicolor. The species is believed to be Asianor African in origin. Sorghum was introduced into theU. S. in the mid-1800's. The grains are small anddifficult to process. We use the various species mostlyfor forage and silage, but in the Old World the grainsare often eaten like rice or made into an unleavenedbread. All of the speciesof the genus are diploids (2n= 2x = 40), except Johnson grass, a very aggressivetetraploid weed. -75-There are four commonly recognized groups ofsorghum species, based upon their use:' syrup or sorgos, whose stem juices areabundant and sweet;' broom-corn, used to make old-stylebrooms;' grain sorghums, such as kaffir, milo, anddurra; and ' grass sorghums, such as Sudan grass,Tunis grass, and Johnson grass, grown forforage and silage.OATS. The origin of Avena sativa is still obscure.There are few references to it in the ancient literature;none, for instance, in the Hebrew Bible. It may havebecome domesticated in the cultivated fields of barleyor of some other crop. It is now grown in temperateregions, chiefly of Europe and North America. TheUSSR is the leading producer. As in wheat, there arediploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid oats. We use thehexaploids more than the others.USEFUL SPECIES OF OATSScientific (Common) Name Genome(s)Diploids [2n = 2x = 14]:A. brevis (slender oat) AAA. strigosa (sand oat) AsAsA. nuda (naked oat) AATetraploids [2n = 4x = 28]:A. barbata (slender oat) AABBA. abyssinica (Abyssinian oat) AABBA. vaviloviana (Vavilov's oat) AABBHexaploids [2n = 6x = 42]:A. fatua var. fatua (wild oat) AACCDDA. fatua var. sativa (cultivated o.) AACCDDA. sterilis (wild red oat) AACCDDA. byzantina (red oat) AACCDDOats, until quite recently, were not widelyappreciated, even though they are very nutritious(protein content of 13.8%). Samuel Johnson, in his1755 dictionary, defined oats as, \u201cA grain which inEngland is generally given to horses, but in Scot-landsupports the people.\u201dOats are used to make flour, rolled oats, and even asa beverage (avena). The crop is often rotated withcorn. Iowa is the leading U. S. producer.Wild Rice. Zizania spp. are native to North America.The common name is confusing, because wild rice isnot a kind of rice. The plants are robust aquatics. Asin maize, the two sexes are found in separatespikelets on different parts of the plant. NativeAmericans gathered the grains by boat. Until recently,wild rice has eluded cultivation with most of the cropcoming from Minnesota. It is now being grown here inCalifornia.JOB\u2019S TEARS. Although native to southeastern Asia,Coix lacryma-jobi is now very common through all ofthe tropical and subtropical regions of the world whereits grains are used as food. It is not highly regarded,even though it has a very high protein content. Manyof you will have seen these grains because they arealso used to make rosaries and tourist trinkets. Thecommon name may derive from an Old Testamentfigure named Job who experienced great suffering.MILLETS. This is the group name for a series of truegrasses that have small grains. Most of the commonones belong to the genera Pennisetum, Setaria,Panicum, and Eleusine. They are also used for forage.Most of us in North America and Europe, except forcollege students who frequent hippie co-op foodstores, have never eaten any of the millets and weprobably do not appreciate the role that they play inthe diet of about one-third of the world's people. Wesee their relatives as roadside weeds or asconstituents in bird seed mix. This unfortunatelycauses us to underestimate their importance ashuman food.-76-THE MINOR CEREALSCommon Name (Scientific Name) Commentacha (Digitaria exilis) African; quite palatable and nutritiousAdlay (Coix lacryma-jobi) See Job's tearsAfrican millet (Eleusine coracana) Widely used in China, India, and Africabarley (Hordeum vulgare) Old World; one of the ancient cerealsbarnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli) Known to us also as an agricultural weedbroom millet (Panicum miliaceum) Cultivated especially in the Old Worldbrowntop (Brachiaria ramosa) A relative of the Panicum cerealsbulrush millet (Pennisetum americanum) A relative of elephant and Napier grasschannel millet (Echinochloa turnerianum) A relative of our barnyard grassclub wheat (Triticum compactum) Grown mostly in Chile, USA, and Indiacommon millet (Panicum miliaceum) In use since prehistoric times; Eurasiadurum wheat (Triticum durum) High in gluten; used to make spaghettieinkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum) Primitive diploid, 1-seeded wheatemmer wheat (Triticum dicoccon) Ancient Mediterranean wheat; still usedfinger millet (Eleusine coracana) Important cereal in Africa and Indiafonio (Digitaria elixis) Used in tropical Africafoxtail millet (Setaria italica) Native to India; Near East & ChinaGerman millet (Setaria italica) See foxtail milletguinea grass (Panicum maximum) A perennial grass of tropical areashog millet (Panicum miliaceum) See common milletHungarian millet (Setaria italica) Old World; now widely cultivatedItalian millet (Setaria italica) See Hungarian milletJapanese millet (Echinochloa crusgalli) See barnyard grassJob's tears (Coix lacryma-jobi) SE Asia; ornamental use in jewelrykoda millet (Paspalum commersonii) Old World; relative of Dallis and bahia grasslittle millet (Panicum sumatrense) Grown extensively in Indiamanna grass (Glyceria spp.) Used especially in North Americanaked oat (Avena nuda) Upland regions of Chinaoats (Avena spp.) Hexaploids most importantpearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) Highly nutritious; hybrids grown in USApod corn (Zea mays) A maize with well-developed bracts around grains; S.

PSEUDOCEREALSA few plants produce fruits that somewhat resemblethe true grains of the cereals and may be confusedwith them, particularly if you are terribly far-sightedand have difficulty distinguishing items that have littlein common. Because they are derived from plantfamilies other than Gramineae, they are called falsecereals or pseudocereals.BUCKWHEAT. Fagopyrum esculentum is grown incool, moist regions. The northeastern United States isone of the major production areas. Buckwheat isrelated to knotweeds, smartweeds, and docks. All arecommon weeds over much of the country. Thepyramid-shaped, one-seeded fruit makes it easy toidentify. We use them to make pancakes, soup, andporridge. We also feed buckwheat to our domesticatedanimals.Kasha, in this country, refers to toasted buckwheatgroats or to a gruel made from them. In Russia andother countries where kasha is a popular food, thename applies to a gruel made from buckwheat or anyof several major/minor cereals.QUINOA. Also known as quinua, Chenopodiumquinoa, is a member of the goosefoot family. Its seedswere first cultivated in about 3000 BCE on the highplains of the Andes. It has been and continues to be-77-an important food plant in South America. Accordingto the Baron Alexander von Humboldt, quinoa was tothe inhabitants of that region what \"wine was to theGreeks, wheat to the Romans, cotton to the Arabs.\"Quinoa seeds are not only rich in protein, but they arehigh in certain essential amino acids (particularlylysine and methionine) that are deficient in mostcereals and legumes. The seeds also contain toxicsaponins that must be leached out or removed by amilling process to render them edible.GRAIN AMARANTHS (Amaranthus spp.) aresometimes advertised as the miracle grain of theancient Aztecs. In North America, we mainlyencounter plants of this genus as undesirable weeds,with names such as pigweed and red root. But, inMexico the small, one-seeded fruits were an importantfood, especially before the Conquest. Spanish clericsinsisted that the growing and use of the grainamaranths cease because the Aztec priests usedthem, combined with human blood, to form figurinesthat were part of their religious ceremonies. The seedsare quite nutritious; relatively high in protein, rich inlysine and oils. Seeds must be boiled, baked, orpopped to render them edible.SUNFLOWER. Helianthus annuus, of the aster ordaisy family, is both a food plant and an industriallyimportant one. The familiar stripped sunflower seed ofour markets is actually a 1-seeded fruit. When wecrack open the shell, we are discarding the fruit wallto gain access to the seed itself. We consume theseseeds and we feed them to our domesticated animals.The seeds are also rich in sunflower oil, which is usedin cooking and in various industrial applications.Argentina is the world's leading producer of sunfloweroil.5.8 ! PULSES(THE EDIBLE LEGUMES)\"And let them give us pulse to eat, and water todrink.\" (Book of Daniel 1:12)' ' ' ' 'The edible fruits and seeds that we derive from thebean or legume family (Leguminosae) are second onlyto the cereals in importance as food plants to us. Theterm pulse is the collective noun for these edibleproducts. The word has been part of the Englishlanguage for hundreds of years, as in the biblicalquote above, but it has almost disappeared fromcurrent usage. In common parlance, we typically referto various edible members of the family as beans orpeas. While there is no clear botanical distinctionbetween the two, there is a tendency for the seeds ofmost kinds of bean to be oval or kidney-shaped andfor most peas to be spherical, except for the black-eyed pea. A gram is a seed or entire legume used forhuman food or animal fodder that is grown in Asia oron the Indian Subcontinent. Examples include thechick-pea, and the black, green, and golden grams.It should be noted that not all plants that have \"bean\"as part of the common name are members of thelegume family. The coffee bean is from a plant in themadder family (Rubiaceae); the castor bean andMexican jumping bean are from plants in the spurgefamily (Euphorbiaceae).The domesticated pulses of the Old World includelentils, peas, vetches, and the soybean. The peoplesof the New World domesticated a variety of beans. Wehave good archeological remains from 5000 BP inMexico and 3000 BP in Peru.The fruit, generally called a pod, splits open along aseam or suture at maturity. We often eat the fruitbefore it is fully mature because it can become tough,fibrous, or almost woody. There are usually severalseeds inside. Technically the fruit is called a legume.Botanists do not recognize \"pod\" as a fruit type.NUTRITIONAL VALUEThe primary nutritional significance of pulses lies intheir protein content. The immature pods are oftenabout 10% protein; mature pods may be 22-40%protein! There may also be a complementationbetween the proteins of the cereals and those inlegumes. For example, the alpha and beta globulins inblack beans complement those of zein, the principalprotein in maize. Lysine is the limiting amino acid inzein. The globulins of black beans are high in lysine.The protein of one complements the other.Although not terribly high in tryptophan (an aminoacid), many pulses supplement that found in maize.Tryptophan acts as a precursor of niacin and itsuccessfully replaces the niacin lost in tortilla making.This helps to explain the lack of pellagra in thoseareas in Central America where the inhabitants eatboth beans and tortillas. This disease is brought aboutby a deficiency in niacin (nicotinic acid). It causes skinlesions, inflammation of the soft tissues of the mouth,diarrhea, and central nervous systems disorders.Maize and beans were not domesticated together.Many of our legume crops have entered into asymbiotic relationship with bacteria. Thesemicroscopic creatures have the ability to fixatmospheric nitrogen. The legume plant uses thisnitrogen in the manufacture of protein, an essentialpart of its life processes. When the plant dies, thisprotein returns to the soil making it richer.FLATULENCE\"Beans, beans, the musical fruit. The more you eat,the more you toot!\" (Kinky children\u2019s verse)And, of course, there is the social problem associatedwith eating beans. It is nicely captured in thechildren's poem quoted above. Bowel gases arecomposed of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide,hydrogen, and methane. They are derived fromswallowed air, production within the gut itself, anddiffusion from the blood into the gut. Hydrogen andmethane are combustible and in proper mixtures withoxygen may even be explosive. The unpleasant odorsthat we associate with other people's bowel gasescome from skatole, indoles, ammonia, and hydrogensulfide.The cause of flatulence is that many of the beans thatwe eat are high in raffinose sugars. They escapedigestion in our intestinal tract because we lack anecessary enzyme (alpha-galactosidase). Bacteria inthe lower portion of our gut act on these sugars toform large amounts of carbon dioxide and hydrogenand to lower the pH of our intestine. Appreciableamounts of methane are also formed. Navy beansseem to have the highest yield: 5-465 cc of gas per-78-hour, with an average of 179 cc. Hot water treatmentsand alcohol extraction may be useful techniques inlowering gas production.TOXICITY\u201cWretches, utter wretches, keep your hands offbeans!\u201d (Empedocles, 5th century BCE)\u201cI tell you too, as did Pythagoras, withhold your handsfrom beans, a hurtful food.\u201d(Callimachus, a 3rd century BCE Greek poet)\u201cAvoid beans as you would matricide.\u201d(Pythagorus, Golden Verses)\u201cOne should abstain from eating beans because theyare full of the material of which our souls are made.\u201d(Diogenes Laertius, 1st century, BCE)' ' ' ' 'These quotes may surprise you. But since the days ofthe ancient Greeks, legumes have been regarded asdangerous. Pulses, fresh or dried, are often boiled orcooked for a sufficiently long time before they areeaten. Several experts recommend at least 10minutes. Not only does this render them morepalatable, but the heating process destroys toxins inthe legume seeds.Here are four syndromes of poisoning that can occurfrom eating improperly prepared legumes, or toomany of them:Lectins are plant proteins that can cause stomachcramps, nausea, and diarrhea. They can also causered blood cells to clump together. Peas and lentils arerelatively low in lectins and it is generally sufficient tobring them to a brief boil before they are cooked.Many beans must be boiled for about 10 minutesbefore you continue to simmer them.Hydrogen cyanide is present at toxic levels in somepulses, such as the lima bean and chick pea. The U. S.Department of Agriculture monitors the HCN contentof various cultivars and will not allow those above acertain level to be sold in this country. The MinimumLethal Dose (MLD) for HCN taken orally is estimatedat 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams per kilogram in humans. Thewhite Burma cultivar has 100 mg; the black PuertoRican strain has 300 mg! Cyanide, contrary to popularbelief, does not kill its victims by paralyzing the lungs.It works at the cellular level to impair cellularrespiration.Favism comes from eating too many fava or broadbeans. It is a form of acute anemia. It occursespecially in males of Mediterranean extraction. Thecause is a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase (G-6-PD).Lathyrism, caused by eating too many sweet pea orgrass pea seeds, again affects primarily males andcauses skeletal deformation and loss of bowel andbladder control. Thousands have died from thisdisorder, particularly in developing countries afterdroughts have killed more desirable food plants andpeople were forced to eat too many seeds.SURVEY OF PULSESBEANS. The genus Phaseolus is the most importantsource of many of our beans, such as the lima, scarletrunner, string, shell, white, and black. Most of themare cultivars of Ph. vulgaris. The plants typicallyrequire hot weather and good moisture. In somecases, we eat the entire fruit; in others we shell awaythe fruit wall and eat only the seeds. Many of ourbeans are of New World origin.FAVA BEAN. Also called broad bean (because of itslarge, flat seeds), Vicia faba is native to northernAfrica or to the Near East. It was the only widelycultivated bean in the Old World before the spread ofthe New World beans after Columbus.GARDEN PEA. Pisum sativum, also called the Englishpea, is native to central and western Asia.Archeological remains go back to 5700 BCE. Anancient Greek play mentions \u201cpease porridge.\u201d Agroup of cultivars called the marrowfats have large,wrinkled seeds. They are commonly used in canningand in frozen foods.GARBANZO BEAN. Also called the chick pea, Cicerarietinum is native to western Asia where it has beencultivated since ancient times. Its seeds are groundinto flour from which a very nutritious bread may bemade. Hummus is a thick paste made of mashedgarbanzo beans, lemon juice, garlic, and tahini oil(from crushed sesame seeds).BLACK-EYED PEA. Vigna unguiculata, also called thecowpea, is native to Africa. It is now grown throughmuch of the tropics and in the southeastern UnitedStates, where it is a very popular regional food plant.Sometimes we eat the pods; at other times the seeds.This genus is also the source of the adzuki bean, fromIndia or Japan, and the mung bean, from India.LENTILS. Lens culinaris -- what a wonderful scientificname! -- is native to southwest Asia. It is an ancientpulse, being a favorite food plant of the Greeks andEgyptians. We have fossil remains from 8000-9000BP. The next time you are preparing or eating lentils,look at the seeds. They are shaped like little opticallenses. Actually, it is the other way around. Glasslenses are called lenses because they are shaped likelentil seeds. Lens is the Latin name for the lentil.MUNG BEAN. Vigna radiata is also known as thegreen, golden, and black gram. Guess what colors itsseeds are. It is a tropical crop, often grown in paddiesafter the rice has been harvested. Its seeds maycontain 25% protein. Sprouted bean shoots have longbeen a favorite in Chinese cooking. Dried seeds havealso been ground into a flour and added to variousdishes.PEANUT. Also called the goober or groundnut,Arachis hypogaea is native to South America. Its usespread from there to Africa and then to the UnitedStates via slaves. The seeds are highly nutritious (1 lbof peanuts yields 2700 calories; 1 lb of beef = 900calories). Peanut oil and the cake that remains afterthe oil has been extracted are also important, thelatter as cattle food.In recent years, much concern has been expressedabout the amount of aflatoxins found in peanutbutter. These toxins are not made by the plant itself,but by a bread mold fungus (Aspergillus flavus) thatcontaminates it. Aflatoxins cause liver damage andthey are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic;they cause cancers, mutations, and birth defects.About 5 million Americans suffer from food allergies,including allergic reactions to the peanut. Symptoms-79-include rapid swelling of the breathing passage way,loss of consciousness, and anaphylactic shock, whichmay be fatal. At the other end of the spectrum of things to worryabout is arachibutyrophobia, the fear of peanutbutter sticking to the roof of your mouth. This is oneof those vocabulary-building words.SOYBEAN. Glycine max is an ancient food plant ofthe Orient. While we do not have an especially goodfossil record, there are references to the plant inliterature from 3000 BP. The U. S. is the world'sleading producer of soybeans; we supply about 70%of the world's crop. The seeds contain 38% proteinand 18% fats and oils. Edible soybean cultivars arebecoming popular again. The seeds may be boiled,baked, or roasted. These processes removed trypsininhibitors that cannot be handled by the digestivesystem of non-ruminants. The seeds may also beground into flour. Intact soybean pods and seeds mayalso be eaten. They are known as edamame.Soybean oil is the leading source of vegetable oilsused in margarine, shortening, salad and cooking oils.Its protein is also being used to enrich foods and as ameat substitute. Soybean oil is used in adhesives,enamels, linoleum, printing ink, and soap.Perhaps 2000 years ago, the Chinese discovered twosomewhat elaborate ways to prepare soybeans. Misois a mixture of ground soybean, salt, and a moldy ricepreparation. It  is a paste that may be used to flavorsoups and sauces. Here is the recipe:Steam beansLAdd moldy rice or barley(or innoculate with bread mold)LSmash beans by footLMix beans and cerealLFerment(for up to 3 years)Tofu or bean curd is a soft, bland, more or less inertlooking substance made from curdled soybean milk.The procedure is much like that for making cheese.Soak beansLGrindLAdd water, then boilLFilterLCurdle(add calcium sulfate)LLadle into boxesLPress to squeeze out wheyWINGED BEAN. Psophocarpus tetragonolobus isprobably native to southeast Asia. It is well adapted tothe humid tropics. The plant, which produces edibletubers and seeds, is the subject of a great deal ofcurrent research to develop it as a major food plant.The tubers contain about 13.5% protein -- much morethan other tropical root crops. Mature seeds haveabout 33% protein, 18% oil, 30% carbohydrates, and8% fiber. They also contain trypsin inhibitors andchemicals that can cause blood to coagulate. Heatingdestroys these substances.CAROB. Also known as St. John\u2019s bread and thelocust bean, Ceratonia siliqua is an evergreen treenative to Syria. It has been cultivated in the Old Worldsince antiquity. The dried pods contain about 50%sugar and they are eaten as candy. The ground seedsare used to make a nutritious meal and in breadmaking. A sweet pulp around the seeds is also eaten.You may have consumed carob without realizing it. Itis a common substitute for chocolate in a variety ofproducts.The ancient Greeks prized the seeds for anotherreason \u2013 their uniform size. They used them tomeasure the weight of gold and silver. They called theseeds \u201ckeration,\u201d from which our modern word \u201ccarat\u201dis derived. The New Testament story of St. John theBaptist eating locusts in the desert gives rise to twoother common names for this plant. Chances are the locust being referred to in that case was not theinsect, but a locust-shaped fruit.EDIBLE FRUITS AND SEEDS OF THE BEAN FAMILYCommon Name (Scientific Name) Origin; Commentadzuki bean (Vigna angularis) India or Japan; used mainly in Orientasparagus bean (Vigna unguiculata ssp. sesquipedalis) India or Africa; immature pods, ripe seedasparagus pea (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) See winged beanBambarra groundnut (Voandzeia subterranea) Africa; consumed like the peanutbean (Phaseolus vulgaris) See common beanblack bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) See common beanblack gram (Vigna mungo) See urd beanblack-eyed pea (Vigna unguiculata ssp. unguiculata) Africa & Asia; seeds and pods eatenbonavist bean (Lablab purpureus) See hyacinth beanbroad bean (Vicia faba) See fava beanbutter bean (Phaseolus lunatus) See lima beanCajan pea (Cajanus cajan) India; very drought resistantcarob (Ceratonia siliqua) Mediterranean; also a chocolate substitutecatjang pea (Vigna unguiculata ssp. u.)

FRUITS WE CALLVEGETABLESIn botany, we define a fruit as the ripened ovary of aflower, along with any other floral or vegetative partsthat may be attached to it or surround it and thatmature at the same time. This definition is notobserved in everyday life when we consider that thereare a number of fruits that we call \"vegetables.\" Incommon parlance, we seem to call certain fruitsvegetables if:' they are eaten along with the main dish;' they are put into a side dish;' we put salt on them; or' they are predominantly green at the stage whenwe consume them.This distinction between a fruit and a vegetable mightseem a pretty trivial matter, but it went all the way tothe United States Supreme Court in 1893. A merchanttried to escape a tax on vegetables (in this casetomatoes) by arguing that they are fruits. TheSupreme Court ruled,\"Botanically speaking, tomatoes are the fruit of a vine,just as are cucumbers, squashes, beans, and peas.But in the common language of the people, whethersellers or consumers of provisions, all these arevegetables, which are grown in kitchen gardens, andwhich are whether eaten cooked or raw, are, likepotatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnips, beets, cauliflower,cabbage, celery, and lettuce, usually served at dinnerin, with, or after the soup, fish or meats whichconstitute the principal part of the repast, and not,like fruits generally, as dessert.The attempt to classify tomatoes as fruit is not unlikea recent attempt to class beans as seeds, of which Mr.Justice Bradley [1889], speaking for the court said:We do not see why they should be classified as seeds,any more than walnuts should be so classified. Bothare seeds in the language of botany or natural history,but not in commerce nor in common parlance.\"THE CUCURBITS(SQUASHES, PUMPKINS, & MELONS)Many of the more common fruits that we callvegetables come from the squash or gourd family(Cucurbitaceae). In botany, we also call themcucurbits, obviously based on the technical name ofthe plant family. Most of the plants are coarse vines,sometimes reaching over 100 ft. in length and bearinga few hundred fruits. The vines produce male andfemale flowers on the same plant. The plants arediploids (2n = 2x = 40).Common names (squashes, pumpkins, melons,marrows, etc.) are something of a problem becausethey of their inconsistent use. Also, there is no cleardistinction between squashes and gourds. Most gourdshave a hard, durable outer rind and are not edible.They have a series of utilitarian uses (cups,containers, ornamentals, etc.). They are discussedelsewhere in the text.The edible members of the family are prized for theirfleshy or fibrous fruit walls and nutritious seeds. Pepitas are the shelled and roasted seeds of thesesquashes. The fruits generally have a very high watercontent and little food value. We have  domesticateddifferent cucurbits in both the Old and New World.Five species of squashes and pumpkins are nativehere. The oldest fossil remains of seeds and rinds datefrom about 7000 BCE in Mexico. The earliest forms didnot have fleshy interiors; it was their seeds that weate. Squashes were carried north from Mexico tobecome a principal food plant of North Americanagricultural Indians. Along with maize and beans,squashes were one the \u201cthree sisters\u201d of theindigenous peoples of this continent. The cucumber,cantaloupe, casaba, and watermelon are native to theOld World and were domesticated there.SURVEY OF EDIBLE CUCURBITSSquashes, pumpkins, and marrows. The wordsquash comes from a Massachusetts Indian term,askutasquash, which means \u201ceaten raw.\u201d Thesquashes are all native to the New World. Thedistinction between summer and winter squashes isarbitrary. Most of the former have soft skins becausethey are eaten when the fruits are immature. Wintersquashes are stored and their skins harden duringstorage.  These cucurbits belong to the genusCucurbita, as seen in the following list:C. pepo: summer s., winter s., vegetablemarrows, spaghetti s. (noodle s.), crookneck s.,yellow custards, pumpkins (some), Americanpattypan, zucchini (courgette)C. maxima: winter s. (larger ones), Hubbard s.,turban s., buttercup s.C. moschata: pumpkins (some), winter s.(smaller ones), winter crooknecksC. ficifolia: ivy-leaved s., Malabar gourdC. argyrosperma: cushaw, silverseed gourdCucumber. A relative of the melons, Cucumis sativusis native to the Himalayan region, where its has beenin cultivation for about 3000 years. It is now unknownin the wild. The cucumber is about 96% water and 2%sugar. The fruits range from a few centimeters toabout half a meter in length. They are eaten fresh orvariously seasoned to yield the familiar pickle. SamuelJohnson once remarked, \u201cA cucumber should be wellsliced, and dressed with pepper and vinegar, and thenthrown out, as good for nothing.\u201d-82-Gherkin. Cucumis anguria is an Old World relative ofthe cucumber. It probably arrived in the New Worldvia the slave trade. Most gherkins are pickled andmost of what we see in our markets are not really thisspecies, but small cucumbers. Look for real gherkinsin the West Indies and in Brazil.Chayote. Also known as the vegetable pear orchristophine, Sechium edule is native to Mexico andCentral America where it was widely used by the Aztecpeople. Its fruit is 1-seeded and it has a greenishflesh. Its tubers are also edible. Once ratheruncommon, chayote is now a standard fixture in manyof our markets in this country.Cassabanana. Also known as the musk cucumber,sikana, or melocot\u00f3n, Sicana odorifera is foundthroughout tropical America. It resembles a very largecucumber, but with orange-yellow flesh. Fresh fruitsare added to soups and stews, but it is more popularwhen made into a jam. The specific epithet suggeststhat the plant has an odor about it. In this case it is apleasant one and the fruits have been used to makelinens smell better.Melons. Cucumis melo, native to Africa and perhapsalso to Southeast Asia, is the source of a number ofthe \u201cdessert fruits,\u201d such as the honeydew, Persian,musk, casaba, cranshaw melons and the cantaloupe.They are not mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptiantexts, but do appear later in Roman works.TOMATO[The tomato is an] \u201c... evil fruit... treacherous anddeceitful.\u201d (Henri LeClerc)\u201c ... a person who should eat a sufficient abundance ofthese apples would never die.\u201d(Dr. Siccaary)Lycopersicon esculentum has had several commonnames through the centuries, including love-apple,mala peruviana, tomatl (an Aztec word from which wederive tomate and tomata), pomi dei Moro, pommed'amour, and pomi d'oro. It is a New World plant,native to the Andes of Ecuador or Peru. Its famespread slowly upon its introduction into Europebecause it was recognized as a member of thenightshade family (Solanaceae) and, therefore,thought to be toxic. The Europeans were correct -- itis toxic under certain circumstances.  Its use as a foodplant is relatively recent.EGGPLANTAlso called the aubergine, mad-apple, spawn of hell,etc., Solanum melongena is a relative of the potato,tomato, and other nightshades. It is a native ofnorthern India, near Burma. The fruit is a large egg-shaped berry, typically purple or black in the cultivarsthat we grow in temperate areas. In tropical regions,yellow- and white-fruited forms are common. Theeggplant is a minor crop in the United States, withFlorida being the leading producer.As with the tomato, the eggplant was not alwayspopular as a food plant... and with good reason!Through the centuries, various authors havesuggested that it can cause insanity (one of itscommon names is mala insana), leprosie, cancer,hemorrhoids, melancholy, cancer, pustules, badbreath, changes in skin color, and obstructions in theliver and spleen.I also encourage you to consider the following itemsthat I have assembled after many years of research.I offer them as part of my continuing effort to bring anunsuspecting world the truth about the hideous purpleperil.' Not a single major religious leader (Moses, Jesus ofNazareth, Mohammed, the Buddha, etc.) everrecommended eggplant to his followers, nor is itmentioned in the sacred writings of any of theworld\u2019s great religions.' The country that grows the most eggplants isCommunist China. What more needs to be said?' Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Saddam Hussein allate the eggplant.' Lord Byron\u2019s \u201cOde to an Aubergine\u201d was sosavaged by literary critics that he destroyed allexisting copies.' Martha Stewart was overcome by the fumes of aneggplant as she attempted to prepare it on hernationally syndicated television program. Sherecovered fully.' The Central Intelligence Agency once used a toxicextract from the eggplant in an attempt to kill FidelCastro.' Mama Cass Elliot did not choke to death on a hamsandwich, as widely reported in the press. Aneggplant became lodged in her throat.' The Monsanto Corporation, using secret techniquesof genetic engineering, has developed a polyploideggplant that can cross with wheat, rice, andmaize and replace them in the fields.As if more evidence were needed, consider thefollowing astounding statistics:' 100% of all Americans who ate eggplant in 1880subsequently died!' 92.6% of all patients in this country\u2019s mentalhospitals ate eggplant.' 87.2% of all heroin addicts began by eatingeggplants.' 98.4% of all individuals who listen to RushLimbaugh on the radio have eaten eggplant.' 82.1% of all divorces occurred in couples who hadconsumed eggplant.' 78.9% of all fatal automobile accidents happenedafter eating eggplants.'

It has been cultivated since antiquity. Itis a member of the mulberry family (Moraceae). Asimilar plant, the Osage-orange or bois d'arc, grows inthe United States. The breadfruit is a false fruit, beingformed by the fusion of many true fruits to produce asingle, large, warty \"fruit.\" Unlike most fruits, thebreadfruit is high in starch (30-40%). It is not eatenfresh, but is typically baked, boiled, or fried. Althoughits seeds are edible, the seedless strains are the mostcommonly used. An eight year old tree can produce700-800 fruits.The cultivars with large, edible seeds are called thebreadnut. Here the surrounding flesh is discardedand the seeds are boiled. They taste like chestnuts.Most of us in this country have never seen breadfruit,but we have heard of the plant because of a famousevent in history. In 1787, Lt. William Bligh was sent toTahiti to collect breadfruit seedlings for eventualtransplanting to feed slaves in the West Indies. As youknow, on the return voyage, the crew of H. M. A. T.Bounty mutinied against the captain and put him andeighteen others (including the ship's botanist, DavidNelson) into a small boat. They survived a grueling 41day ocean voyage. The mutineers, led by FletcherChristian, established their new home on PitcairnIsland. Bligh went on to become a Vice Admiral in theRoyal Navy and a Governor in Australia.Two close relatives of the breadfruit are the jackfruit,also spelled jakfruit (A. heterophyllus), whose giantfruits can weigh about 70 lbs., and the marang (A.odoratissima, whose scientific name suggests one ofits best known features -- it is highly aromatic.OKRAAbelmoschus esculentus [= Hibiscus e. in the olderliterature] is native to Africa, perhaps the Upper NileValley. It came to the New World via slaves in the 16thcentury. They also brought with them dried peas,yams, and ackee, an interesting fruit. Okra  is relatedto hibiscus and cotton. This is fairly evident when youexamine the flowers. It is a very popular vegetable,especially in French Louisiana where it is used insoups, stews, etc. Some people object to its slimy,mucilaginous nature. We eat the immature fruit, acapsule. If you let it mature, it gets almost woody andsplits open. What is the best way to serve okra? Tosomeone else!SPAGHETTI TREEWe have become so accustomed to eating artificialspaghetti that many of us are unaware that thenatural version grows on plants. Pastadendron italica,the spaghetti tree, is native to the hilly regions of theMediterranean. The edible portion is a stringyoutgrowth on the surface of seeds. In the earlysummer, the tree\u2019s woody pods split open to revealnumerous seeds, each with a string of carbohydrate-rich tissue about 30 cm long. It is a curious sight tosee hundreds of these trees with their strands ofspaghetti dangling gracefully in the wind. Processingis simple, but laborious. Workers, usually of thepeasant class, move through the spaghetti treeplantations and harvest the material manually.Attempts to mechanize the process have not beensuccessful. As with cotton, it is necessary to separatethe seed, which will be discarded, from the desiredportion. This is done by hand, one seed at a time. Thetissue is then washed and placed in the sun to dry bycarefully arranging the spaghetti on a network ofstrings or wire drying racks. Almost all of the work isdone by women. A few years ago, the BBC producedan award-winning documentary on the harvesting andprocessing of spaghetti. A particularly touching part ofthe film showed women singing various harvestingsongs as they plucked the spaghetti from the trees.Historically, the very best spaghetti came from treesgrown around Tuscany. Unfortunately, almost all ofthem were destroyed during World War II. Thisprompted the research to produce artificial spaghetti,as did a dramatic increase in the popularity ofMediterranean foods. Attempts to improve spaghetti\u2019snutritional quality and the length of the strandsthrough hybridization with other species ofPastadendron have not been successful. The Italiangovernment has funded a spaghetti tree germplasmcenter (\u201cseed bank\u201d) in Rome, in an attempt topreserve the genetic heritage of the species. To date,five genomes have been identified.Real spaghetti is once again available in our localmarkets,  but it is quite a bit more expensive. It issold under the label \u201cSpaghetti Antigua\u201d or \u201cSpaghettia la Tuscany.\u201d It must be kept refrigerated.

See the discussion ofpulses elsewhere in the syllabus for a more complete listing.2. The garden or English pea belongs to the genus Pisum. The black-eyed pea is a kind of Vigna; the chickpeaor garbanzo bean belongs to the genus Cicer.3. Most of the commonly encountered squashes (crookneck, banana, summer, scallop, butter, etc.) belong toCucurbita or Cucumis.-85-5.10 ! FRUITS OF THETEMPERATE ZONEMany of the fruits that we commonly eat, with theexception of the banana, citrus fruits, and thepineapple, come from temperate areas of the world.Most of these fruits are intensively cultivated, ratherthan being fruits easily available in the wild state. Therose family (Rosaceae) is the single largest source ofthese species.Most of the temperate fruits are of Old World origin.Many of them have been in cultivation since ancienttimes. In more advanced societies, fruits are not astaple. They provide interesting flavors and variety toour table. Some of them are high in vitamins, variousorganic acids, and mineral content. For the most part,however, they are nutritionally poor. They are mostlywater. Because of the high water content and theirtexture, many fruits are perishable. Pickling, canning,and freezing have allowed their shipment around theworld. So has rapid air transportation.SURVEY OF TEMPERATE FRUITSAPPLE. Malus sylvestris probably ranks first ineconomic  importance and extent of cultivation. It isnative to the Caucasus Mountains of western Asia. Wehave perpetuated, and to some extent developed,over 6500 horticultural forms. The Old World specieswere introduced into the United States by colonistswho were dissatisfied with the fruits of the nativespecies.A ripe apple is about 84% water, 11% sugar, and0.3% protein. It is usually harvested ripe, because itwill not ripen well after being picked. Apples are verysensitive to a variety of insect and fungal pests.PEAR. Pyrus communis is native to Eurasia. The plantis similar to the apple in appearance. It is propagatedeither by seed or by grafting. The United Statesproduces about one-quarter of the total output. Pearsare picked before they reach full maturity.APRICOT. Prunus armeniaca is an Asian species. Ithas been used in China since about 2000 BC. Becausethe flowers are sensitive to frost, apricots are grownin warmer climates. They were introduced intoCalifornia in the 18th century. Sun dried fruits arevery popular.PEACH. Prunus persica is native to China. Like theapricot, it is an ancient fruit. It was introduced intothe United States by the early colonists. Today it issecond only to the apple in importance in this country.The nectarine, sometimes distinguished as P. persicavar. nectarina is a peach without fuzz, often with aricher flavor. It is not a hybrid, as many peoplebelieve.PLUMS AND PRUNES. Several species of Prunus, amember of the rose family, are the source of plums.The ones that reach our tables are derived fromEurope, Japan, or they are native to North America.The plum industry in this country is centered on thePacific coast. Prunes are merely plums with a highsugar content. They can be cured without removingthe stone inside.STRAWBERRY. The two most important species inthe United States are Fragaria chiloensis, which isnative to the New World from Chile to the westerncoast of North America, and F. virginica, a wildstrawberry native to the eastern part of the continent.Both species are octaploids. The European \"ever-bearing strawberry\" (F. vesca) is a diploid. Except forthis species, the cultivated strawberries are allpropagated by runners or stolons; they reproduceasexually. The \"fruit\" is very sensitive to pressure andcan be easily bruised. Most strawberries are,therefore, handpicked. Unlike most other temperatefruits, the strawberry is the result of an intensiveselection and breeding program.The edible portion of the strawberry is not the fruititself, but the expanded, swollen stem tip that bearstiny, hard, seed-like fruits. Most of us would bedelighted if breeders could only get rid of those peskylittle fruits so that we could better enjoy the succulent,sugary stem. \u201cDoubtless God could have made a better berry, butdoubtless God never did.\u201d (William Butler)BRAMBLES. From the single genus Rubus, we derivethe raspberry, blackberry, thimbleberry, dewberry,youngberry, loganberry, boysenberry, and a series oflesser known kinds. The berry is not really a berry inthe botanical sense, but an aggregation of numeroussmall, fleshy fruits giving the appearance of a singlestructure.CURRANTS AND GOOSEBERRIES. We eat bothnative and introduced species. Gooseberry plants havebristly branches and 1-3 fruits in a cluster. Currantsdo not have bristles and typically have 4 or morefruits in a cluster. Often currants are used in the formof jelly. One species, Ribes nigrum, is the alternatehost for the white pine blister rust. The common name\"currant\" is also used for a kind of grape grownprincipally in Greece.MULBERRY. The mulberry is a false fruit -- anaggregation of many tiny fruits put together in such away as to simulate a single, larger fruit. The blackmulberry (Morus nigra) is native to Asia Minor. It hasbeen in use there for thousands of years. The whitemulberry (M. alba), also from Asia, is used as food forthe silkworm. The red mulberry (M. rubra) is native toNorth America.CRANBERRY. The American cranberry, Vacciniummacrocarpon, is a low-growing shrub of the heathfamily (Ericaceae). It is usually cultivated in a low,acidic bog. It is related to our local huckleberries andsalal. At present, the organized cranberry industry ismainly in the United States. Another species, V.oxycoccus, is native to the northern portions ofEurope, Asia, and North America.GRAPES. Vitis vinifera is native to Southwest Asia,where it has been cultivated for millennia. Manycultivars, literally thousands of them, have beenselected. Early attempts by the Colonists to establisha grape industry in the United States were largelyunsuccessful until they started to use the nativespecies. The Concord grape is such an example. Thewine industry in California is not based upon ournative grapes, but on the European V. vinifera. I haveheard one or two tour guides in the Napa Valleycarefully explain (incorrectly) that they use only good,old American grapes! More about this in the lecture onwine making.-86-TEMPERATE FRUITSCommon Name (Scientific Name) Familyacorn  (Quercus spp.) oakalmond (Prunus dulcis var. dulcis) roseapple (Malus sylvestris) roseapricot (Prunus armeniaca) rosebarberry (Berberis vulgaris) barberrybeechnut (Fagus sylvatica) oakbilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) heathblackberry (Rubus spp.) roseblueberry (Vaccinium spp.) heathboysenberry (Rubus ursinus) rosebullace (Prunus insititia) rosebutternut (Juglans cinerea) walnutcherry, sweet (Prunus avium) rosechestnut (Castanea sativa) oakcloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) rosecowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) heathcrabapple (Malus spp.) rosecranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) heathcurrant (Ribes spp.) gooseberrycurrant, black (Ribes nigrum) gooseberrycurrant, red (Ribes rubrum) gooseberrydamson (Prunus insititia) rosedewberry (Rubus spp.) roseelderberry (Sambucus canadensis) honeysucklefilbert (Corylus spp.) aldergage (Prunus insititia) rosegooseberry (Ribes spp.) gooseberrygooseberry, Chinese (Actinidia chinensis) actinidiagrape (Vitis vinifera) grapegreen gage (Prunus insititia var. italica) rosehawthorn (Crataegus spp.) rosehazelnut  (Corylus spp.) alderhickory (Carya spp.) walnuthuckleberry (Vaccinium spp.) heathkiwiberry (Actinidia chinensis) actinidialoganberry (Rubus ursinus) rosemedlar (Mespilus germanica) rosemirabelle (Prunus insititia var. syriaca) rosemorello (Prunus cerasus) rosemulberry, black (Morus nigra) mulberrymulberry, red (Morus rubra) mulberrynectarine (Prunus persica) roseolive (Olea europaea) olivepeach (Prunus persica) rosepear (Pyrus communis) rosepecan (Carya illinoensis) walnutpersimmon (Diospyros spp.) ebonypistachio (Pistacia vera) cashewplum (Prunus domestica) roseplum, American (Prunus americana) roseplum, cherry (Prunus cerasifera) roseplum, Japanese (Prunus salicina) roseprunes (Prunus domestica) rosequince (Cydonia oblonga) roseraisin (Vitis vinifera) graperaspberry, black (Rubus occidentalis) roseraspberry, red (Rubus idaeus var. idaeus) rosestrawberry (Fragaria spp.) rosestrawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) heathveitchberry (Rubus ursinus) rosewalnut, black (Juglans nigra) walnutwalnut, English (Juglans regia) walnutwineberry (Rubus phoenicolasius) roseyoungberry (Rubus ursinus) rose5.11 ! EDIBLE NUTSEdible nuts were among our earliest foods gatheredfrom wild trees. They were easily harvested andnutritious. Many nuts contain about 10-30% protein,55-70% fat (often highly un- or monosaturated), andthey may also be a good source of vitamins. A few arerich in starch. Their water content is low, which meansthat they will store well if kept cool.The term nut may be defined botanically as a hard,one-seeded fruit that does not dehisce (split open) atmaturity. We usually break through a hard shell to getto the seed inside. The nut may also be partially toalmost completely hidden by a leathery or spiny cupor husk. The nuts derived from trees in the oak andbirch families fit this more restricted definition ratherwell. Other fruits that are often considered nuts by thegeneral public are technically drupes, as in thealmond, coconut, pecan, and walnut. Menninger(1977) suggests the broadest definition. A nut is \u201canyhard shelled fruit or seed of which the kernel iseaten....\u201d In other words, sometimes a nut is a 1-seeded fruit; sometimes a nut is a seed that has beenremoved from a multi-seeded fruit, as in the peanut orthe Brazil nut. Pine nuts represent a special casebecause these edible seeds are not borne in fruits, buton specialized woody cone scales of the familiar cone.By the way, the Menninger that I just quoted is thebrother of the founder of the famous clinic in Topeka,Kansas.Look for the discussion of the peanut under thelegumes and the coconut under tropical fruits.-87-NUTRITIONAL VALUESFruit % Protein % Fats % WaterAlmond 20 40-60 4Brazil nut 17-20 65-70 5Chestnut 2-4 2-5 52Filbert 18 68 5Macadamia 8 70 3Pecan 18 70 1Pistachio 18 55 5Pine nut 12-31 47-68 3Walnut 15 70 3SURVEY OF EDIBLE NUTSALMOND (PRUNUS DULCIS). The almond wasdomesticated in the Old World about 3000 BCE and isnow the world\u2019s most important nut tree. California isthe leading producer. It has wide uses in foods,candies, etc. The tree is a member of the rose familyand therefore related to the cherry and the apricot.There are two varieties of almonds \u2013 sweet (var.dulcis) and bitter (var. amara). The differencebetween the two is how much hydrogen cyanide theycontain!BRAZIL NUT (BERTHOLLETIA EXCELSA). Thereare no Brazil nut plantations any where in the world.We harvest the seeds from wild trees growing inAmazonia after their heavy wooden pods have fallento the ground. By the way, these fruits are heavyenough to cause injury and even death if you are hiton the head by one of them! Pods are split open toextract the 1-25 seeds that they contain. Brazil nutsare second only to macadamia nuts in mono-unsaturated oils. They are eaten raw, roasted, orsalted.CHESTNUT (CASTANEA SATIVA). This relative ofthe oaks and beech tree is native to Europe, where ithas been popular since ancient times. Chestnuts haveless fat and more starch than other nuts. They areroasted (think of street vendors or Nat King Cole\u2019ssong) or boiled and used in flour, bread, porridge,fritters, and for stuffing the interiors of birds. We havea chestnut that is native to eastern North America (C.dentata), but its importance has been much reducedin the 20th century because of a fungal disease(chestnut blight).FILBERTS AND HAZELNUTS (CORYLUS SPP.).These Eurasian shrubs are related to birch trees. Thegeneric name derives from the Greek word for a hoodor helmet, a reference to the husk that surrounds thefruit. If that structure extends beyond the fruit, it is afilbert; if not, it is a hazelnut. An unrelated use for thehazelnut is to make divining rods.MACADAMIA NUT (MACADAMIA SPP.). Twospecies of Macadamia, also known as the Queenslandnut and the Mac nut, are native to Australia. Themacadamia nut is named after a local naturalist, JohnMacadam. It was domesticated in 1858 and it is theonly Australian food plant of world wide economicimportance. It is third after the pineapple and sugarcane in the Hawai\u2019ian economy. It is prized as one ofthe gourmet nuts because of its delicate flavor. Sothat\u2019s why they cost so much!PECAN (CARYA ILLINOENSIS). This tree is nativeto the central and southern parts of the United Statesand it is the most important native nut tree in NorthAmerica. The common name comes from paccan, theAlgonquin Indian name. A really good pecan tree canproduce 400 lbs. of nuts each year. In addition to thedelectable pecan pie, pecan oil is used in cosmeticsand pharmaceuticals. The pecan belongs to the sameplant family as the walnut. In both cases the fruit(technically a drupe) is enclosed in a husk.PINE NUTS (PINUS SPP.). Pine nuts are also calledpi\u00f1on, pinyon, and pignolia nuts. A number ofdifferent pines from both the Old and New Worldsyield these edible seeds. The ancient Romans ate pinenuts; so did the Indians of North America.PISTACHIO (PISTACIA VERA). This relative of thecashew is native to the Middle East and Central Asia.The principal production regions are Iran, Turkey, andCalifornia. We eat pistachios raw or salted in brinewhile still in the shell. The seed itself is usually green(from chlorophyll) and the shell reddish. Here inCalifornia, we often dye shells a darker red. Thepistachio costs about three or four times what we payfor other nuts.WALNUTS (JUGLANS SPP.). The common or Englishwalnut (J. regia) is native to Europe, Asia, and China,where it was domesticated thousands of years ago.The edible portion is the enlarged embryonic leaves(cotyledons), as in the pecan. California is the leadingproducer. Walnut trees can live for 300-400 years.Walnuts are very popular in France and in Britain,where the Brits like to pickle them in vinegar. Thewalnut shell is often bleached with chlorine or sulfurdioxide. The black walnut (J. nigra) is native toeastern North America. It has a thicker shell that ismore difficult to crack open, but the seed inside has aricher flavor than its Old World cousin.-88-EDIBLE NUTSCommon (Scientific) Name Production Centersacorn (Quercus spp.) North AmericaAfrican walnut (Coula edulis) Africaalmond (Prunus dulcis) North AmericaAmerican beech (Fagus sylvatica) North AmericaAmerican chestnut (Castanea dentata) North Americabeaked filbert (Corylus cornuta) North Americabeech nut (Fagus spp.) Europe, N.

TROPICAL &SUBTROPICAL FRUITSOne of the most striking features of tropical andsubtropical fruits is their diversity. There are literallyhundreds of kinds, belonging to a number of plantfamilies that are relatively unknown to most of us,even to the average temperate botanist. Many of thefruits are used widely. Some of them, such as thebanana, coconut, various citrus fruits, and thepineapple, have become quite common in ourmarkets. Hundreds more are used locally and rarelyenter into regional or international trade. Commonnames abound and there is also some confusion in theapplication of scientific names.While the various tropical and subtropical fruits arenot major portions of our diet, they are often veryimportant daily foods of tropical peoples. The foodvalue is variable. Often the fruit is mostly water and oflittle value, while others are high in certain vitamins,organic acids, and minerals.While the rose family (Rosaceae) is the primary sourceof fruits in the temperate zone, it plays a minor role intropical and subtropical areas. The major plantfamilies from which tropical fruits are derived includethe cashew family (Anacardiaceae), which comes as asurprise to many of us who know only its mostcommon North American representatives -- poisonoak, poison ivy, and poison sumac; the custard applefamily (Annonaceae); the myrtle family (Myrtaceae),also a source of many ornamental shrubs; the citrusfamily (Rutaceae); the sapote family (Sapotaceae);and the soapberry family (Sapindaceae).In the survey that follows, I will devote most of theattention to six of the major tropical fruits andcomment briefly on a few others of interest.BANANA AND RELATIVES\u201cThere is nothing so delicious as a banana.\u201d(Benjamin Disraeli)The banana was domesticated in Southeast Asia; itswild counterparts can still be found there today. Thereare about 25-30 species and subspecies in cultivation.The banana of commerce is Musa x paradisiaca. About300 cultivars are now planted.THE BANANA AND ITS ALLIESMusa acuminata Cavendish, dwarf, ChineseMusa balbisianaMusa corniculata horse bananaMusa discolorMusa erransMusa nana dwarf bananaMusa oleracea banana poret\u00e9Musa x paradisiaca banana, plantain, platanoMusa superba wild plantainMusa troglodytarum fe\u2019iMusa textilis Manila hempEnsete ventricosum Abyssinian bananaA banana \"tree\" is actually a large, tree-like herb. Itcan reach a height of 25 ft. The trunk of a bananaplant is a series of overlapping leaf bases, hiding asmall central shoot that will later give rise to theflower cluster. The bulk of the stem system is a large,fleshy rhizome that lies underground. The leaves maybe 10-12 ft long. They are simple, but often appearpinnately compound because of the fraying of theblade that results from wind damage. The flowercluster is large and drooping, with the growing tip atthe bottom end of the inverted cluster. The femaleflowers, which will eventually produce the fruits, areborne toward the base of the cluster. The male flowersare toward the tip. These unisexual flowers, althoughconspicuous and attractive, are sterile. A plant willbegin to bear fruit in about 8-14 months. A maturefruiting cluster can weigh up to 140 lbs. Individualbananas occur in small bunches, known in theindustry as \"hands.\"By the way, if banana flowers are sterile, where didthose fruits come from? Review the brief discussion ofparthenocarpy in the introductory section.Bananas are harvested while green. They are soperishable that if they were picked after maturing,they would spoil before reaching the markets. After aplant has borne fruit, it usually dies back or is cutdown. Bananas are loaded on air-conditioned ships fortransport to world markets. The hold is usually kept atabout 14E C to prevent premature ripening. Thetemperature will later be raised to begin thematuration process. At that stage, the bananas turnfrom green to yellow and starch begins to change tosugar.Many different cultivars are now available, but we seeonly a few of them in our temperate markets. Ourlocal stores are carrying more than they once did.Until a few years ago, the most common cultivar was\"Gros Michel\" or \"Big Mike.\" It was wiped out by thedreaded Panama disease. Big Mike has been replacedby \"Valery\" and \"Lacatan.\"Modern bananas and their relatives contain fivegenomes (A, B, E, F, and T). All edible bananas-90-contain either the A (Acuminata) or B (Balbisiana)chromosome sets (AAA, AAB, ABB, BBB). The industryis based upon an AAA triploid [2n = 3x = 33]. Bananafruits are seedless, and therefore sterile, because ofthe genetic complications that arise from having threeidentical sets (AAA) of chromosomes competing withone another as they go through meiosis. Bananas arepropagated vegetatively by cuttings taken from themother plant.A close relative of the banana is the plantain, alsoknown as the platano or cooking banana. It is verywidely used in tropical countries as a food plant, butwas rarely seen in our markets until recent years. Theplantain must be cooked before use because it storescarbohydrates in the form of starch, rather thansugar. The cooking process converts starch to sugar.The only other economically important species is Musatextilis, the Manila hemp. It is not grown for its ediblefruits, but for its fibers. They are used in heavy ropesand in very delicate tea bags.A less known relative is Ensete ventricosum, theensete or Abyssinian banana. It is grown in Africa forfiber and for food \u2013 not from nice fleshy fruits. Theedible portions are the young shoots, leaf bases,flowers, and seeds.CITRUS FRUITSThe various citrus fruits, excluding the grapefruit andnumerous hybrids, all appear to be native toSoutheast Asia. The plants are shrubs or small treeswith compound leaves reduced to a single leaflet. Theplants have a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi inthe soil. Citrus plants are said to lack root hairs andthis relationship is probably explained on this basis. Allof the species are diploids [2n = 2x = 18].Most citrus production is in the New World, in bothtemperate and tropical areas. More oranges are grownthan any other citrus fruit. Annual production is about56 million metric tons; Brazil is the leading producer.Next comes the tangerine, at about 10 million metrictons, mostly from Japan. About 13 million metric tonsof lemons, limes, grapefruits, and pomelos areproduced each year. The United States is the leadingproducer.Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C, just as you havealways been told. The rind contains numerous oilglands, the basis of a famous parlor trick that I will tellyou about in lecture. The part of the fruit that we eatis a series of thick, juicy hairs that line the paperyseptations within the fruit. Look very closely nexttime!Some citrus fruits, such as the orange and thegrapefruit, are allowed to ripen on the tree. Others,such a lemons and limes, are harvested green. Manyoranges are artificially colored or treated with gases orother chemicals to destroy the green chlorophylls inthe flesh of the fruit to give it a better appearance onthe market shelf.The more familiar citrus fruits are the orange, lemon,lime, mandarin orange, tangerine, kumquat, citron,pomelo, shaddock, and sour orange. The grapefruitappears to be a spontaneous, recent hybrid betweenthe orange and the pomelo. All of them are variousspecies of Citrus, except for the kumquat. It belongsto the genus Fortunella.SUMMARY OF THE GENUS CITRUSSubgenus:  Scientific/Common Name.

C (ascorbic acid) from fresh vegetablesand fruits. Tens of thousands of sailors died fromscurvy, especially from the 15th to the 18th centuries.One of the earliest scientific investigations was that ofDr. James Lind, who published \u201cA Treatise on Scurvy\u201din 1753. He concluded that various citrus fruits werevery effective in the prevention and treatment ofscurvy. It would take almost a century for the Lords ofthe Admiralty to approve the use of lime juice onBritish naval vessels. Now you know why Britishsailors are called limeys.Here are typical symptoms of the disease:' Longing for land, greenery, home' Uncontrollable weeping' Depression' Weakening of capillaries' Subcutaneous bleeding' Anemia' Skin \u201cblack as ink\u201d' Ulcers on legs' Loose teeth' Gums protruding from mouth' Really bad breath!' Stiffness/soreness of joints' Slow healing of wounds' Difficult breathing' Overwhelmed by stimuli' Death-91-COCONUT\u201cHe who plants a coconut tree, plants food and drink,vessels and clothing, a habitation for himself, and aheritage for his children.\u201d(Polynesian traditional saying)' ' ' ' 'As inhabitants of the temperate zone, it is all butimpossible for us to appreciate Cocos nucifera, whichhas been called \"one of Nature's greatest gifts toMan,\" the \"tree of life,\" the \"tree of heaven,\" and\"Mankind's greatest provider in the tropics.\" There itprovides food, drink, oil, medicine, fiber, timber,thatch, mats, fuel, and domestic utensils. In additionto these utilitarian aspects, the coconut has alsoplayed a prominent role in the customs and beliefs oftropical peoples.The home of the coconut remains controversial. Itappears to have been present in both the Old Worldand the Americas before 1492. The fruit is able tofloat for a hundred days or more in salt water; thebest ocean currents are from Asia to the New World.It was probably first domesticated in the Indo-Pacificregion. There are no reproductive or geneticdifficulties here. 2n = 2x = 32.The coconut is a kind of palm. The trees can produce50-100, to as many as 500 fruits per year. The firstcrop typically comes on in about 6-8 years. The fruitis single-seeded. The fruit wall is clearly differentiatedinto an outer layer (exocarp) that is woody; a middlelayer (mesocarp) that is fibrous; and an inner, bonylayer (endocarp) that is more or less fused to the seedcoat. When we see coconuts in our markets, theexocarp and mesocarp have been removed duringprocessing. The coconut \"seed\" is the true seed, plusthe innermost layer of the fruit wall, the endocarp.After harvesting, the fruits are cut in half and thecoconut meat is gouged out. It will be cured in the sunor in kilns to yield copra. It contains about 60-68%oil. Coconut oil is about 90% saturated and it is one ofthe \"tropical oils\" that manufacturers are increasinglyproud to say they are no longer using in their foods.Once the oil has been removed from copra, theresidue (coconut cake) is used for cattle feed. It is arich source of protein and carbohydrates. Curiously, itis rarely eaten by humans, even in areas whereprotein is otherwise deficient.The middle portion of the fruit wall, the fibrousportion, is the source of coir. This fiber, sometimessold under the name coco fiber, is used for mats,rugs, filters, stuffing, and rope.  Various plant partsyield sennit fiber used to make ropes, hats, andother items.DATE PALM\u201cHonor your maternal aunt, the palm, for it wascreated from the clay left over after the creation ofAdam (on whom be peace and the blessings of God!\u201d (The Prophet Muhammad)' ' ' ' 'We have been cultivating Phoenix dactylifera for 6000-8000 years. According to Muslim tradition, the firstdate palms arose from the dust left over from thecreation of Adam. This explains one of the plantscommon names, the \"tree of life.\" Wild populationswith small, inedible fruits may still be found in SaudiArabia and the Sahara. Today the domesticated formsare found on the fringes of African and Asian deserts.The date palm was introduced into California in 1765at Mission San Ignacio. This state and Arizona areleading producers in the U. S. The palm trees on theArcata plaza are Ph. canariensis, a relative of the datepalm native to the Canary Islands.The leaves of the date palm are used for thatchingand matting, and its trunks for building materials. Thefruit is a drupe, with a brown skin (exocarp), a sweetjuicy pulp (mesocarp), and a thin, bony layer(endocarp) surrounding a single seed. The fruits havea high sugar content. They may be consumed fresh,dried, or pounded into a paste. In the Arab world,they are often eaten with milk. If properly dried, theywill last indefinitely. A single tree can produce about100 lbs. of dates each year. Trees may continue tobear fruit for 100-200 years. Maturing fruits are oftenbagged to protect them from birds and insects. Weharvest dates the same way that we did in ancienttimes -- by hand, with a sharp knife.The Hebrews and Babylonians carried out a ritualceremony to ensure that a good crop of dates wouldbe produced. Even though the concept of sexuality inplants would not be discovered until the close of the17th century, they had found that it was necessary tobring pollen-bearing flowers into the oases where thedate palms grew. The cultivated date palm is a femaleplant and it must be fertilized with pollen from a maledate palm tree if it is to produce fruit. For thousandsof years, we have maintained a few, isolated maletrees wherever we cultivate the date palm for thispurpose. Although its seeds are fertile, we usually cutoff sucker shoots at the base of the trunk to grow newdate palms.We also discovered that we could ferment the sap ofthe date palm and produce arrak, which one sixteenthcentury traveler called  \"the strongest and mostdreadful drink ever invented.\"PINEAPPLEAnanas comosus, native to the New World, wasunknown to Europeans until it was first seen byColumbus in 1493 on Guadaloupe Island. By thattime, the inhabitants of tropical America had alreadyselected seedless varieties for their use. Their wildcounterparts with numerous seeds could still be seengrowing in the vicinity of villages. When the pineapplewas introduced to Europe, it was considered aninteresting oddity, but certainly not an edible fruit.Leading growers include Costa Rica, the United States(principally in Hawaii), Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, andSouth Africa.The pineapple plant is an herb with a basal clump ofstiff, sword-shaped leaves. Many of the cultivars havesharp teeth on the leaf margins. The widely usedCayenne cultivar does not. The flowers are borne atthe center of the rosette of leaves. At first, the flowersare separate from one another, but as the plant setsfruit, the individual fruits from adjacent flowers fusewith one another to form a false fruit, the familiarpineapple. The hole in the center of canned pineapplerepresents the area once occupied by the central axisof the fruiting cluster. A plant can bear fruit in aboutone year. After the first pineapple has been cut fromthe plant, the growing point divides and the next cropwill be two, smaller pineapples per plant. After these-92-are harvested, the growing point divides once again,and four even smaller pineapples are produced. Theseare often used to make pineapple juice. After the 4-pineapple stage, replanting occurs. Except forhandpicking, the pineapple industry is now almostcompletely automated.Modern cultivars are also seedless. Unlike the banana,however, there are no genetic difficulties that preventsexual reproduction from occurring. We see to that byexcluding the pollinators needed for cross-polination.The fruits contain about 15% sugar, some organicacids, minerals, and a proteolytic enzyme calledbromelain. Because it can digest animal tissue,workers in the pineapple fields and processing plantsmust wear protective clothing. Test the power ofbromelain yourself by allowing the juice of areasonably fresh pineapple to remain on your lips.Note the tingling sensation as the enzyme begins todissolve the delicate tissue of your buccal orifice!FIGThe ancestral home of Ficus carica is probablysouthern Arabia. It spread quickly to theMediterranean. There are now several kinds of figs incultivation, notably the common fig, the Capri fig, andthe Smyrna fig. As in the pineapple, the sap of the figcontains a proteolytic enzyme that is the cause of anoccupational hazard called \"fig-pickers disease.\"FIG RELATIVESBanyan tree Ficus benghalensisWeeping fig Ficus benjaminaIndian rubber tree Ficus elasticaBo tree Ficus religiosaSycamore fig Ficus sycamorusCreeping fig Ficus pumilaStrangler fig Ficus spp.Mulberry Morus spp.Osage-orange Metopium toxiferumBreadfruit Artocarpus altilisJackfruit Artocarpus heterophyllusFRUIT STRUCTUREThe fig is a false fruit. What appears to be the  skinand much of the flesh of the \u201cfruit\u201d is a receptacle,which is stem tissue. If you cut a fig in longitudinalsection (down the middle), you can see that it has ahollow interior. At the top of the fig is a small opening(osteole) lined with scales. The inner wall of the vase-like structure is lined with hundreds of unisexualflowers. The upper section is covered with maleflowers; the middle and lower portions with femaleflowers. Figs produce two kinds of female flowers. Onetype is sterile and the other fertile. The latter willproduce a tiny, one-seeded fruit. These are the truefruits of the fig. As in the strawberry, it is easy toassume that the tiny fruits are the seeds of the plant,located within a fleshy fruit. POLLINATIONLet\u2019s focus on the wild form of the edible fig (Ficuscarica). It will form three different versions of figsduring the year. The first one appears during thewinter months. It contains male flowers and sterileflowers. Tiny female wasps (Blastophaga psenes) willenter the opening at the top of this fig, penetrate thewall of the ovary, and deposit their eggs inside thesterile flowers. When she lays an egg, she also injectsa drop of a special secretion that will stimulate thesterile flower to develop gall tissue. This will nourishthe newly-hatched wasp larvae. She then dies. Theeggs hatch, with male wasps appearing first. Theyhave poorly-developed legs and eyes, and they haveno wings. The males roam around in the interior of thefig, looking for flowers that contain female wasps. Themales bore through the ovary wall, find the females,and fertilize them right then and there. Talk aboutcradle-robbing. The males then die. The femalesemerge from the flowers and find their way to theopening, and exit the fig. The scales around theosteole will often damage their wings and antennae. As they pass through the opening, they are dustedwith the pollen of the male flowers, which have justmatured. It is June. The gravid female wasps nowmigrate to a second generation of figs that has beenmaturing on the tree. They leave behind the earthlyremains of their mother and their brothers.The second generation of figs contains a mixture offemale flowers and sterile flowers, or it may containonly female flowers. The wasp will lay her eggs in bothtypes of flowers, but only those laid in the sterileflower type will develop. They have a hollow, shortneck (style) that sits on top of the ovary. It is shortenough that when the female wasp attempts to layeggs in the sterile flower, her egg-laying apparatus(ovipositor) is long enough to reach the chamber inthe flower\u2019s ovary. That location is essential for propermaturation of the wasp\u2019s eggs. The female flowers, onthe other hand, have a much longer, solid style -- toolong for the wasp\u2019s ovipositor. However, when thewasp attempts to lay her eggs in the female flowers,she coats the stigma with the pollen that she hasbrought on her body from the first generation of figs.That pollen will fertilize the female flowers and theywill set seed. It is now autumn. Following the sameplan, gravid female wasps emerge from the sterileflowers, leave the second generation of figs, andmigrate to the third generation of figs. It has a smallerreceptacles and it contains only sterile flowers. Egglaying and fertilization occur, as before. A newgeneration of wasps emerges in the winter and thecycle repeats itself.FIG POLLINATION[February]Gravid female wasp enters figLDeposits egg + injects special secretionLGall forms (food for her young)LShe diesLLarvae hatchLMale wasp emerges firstLPierces flower - fertilizes female waspLMale wasps die[May or June]Fig has ripened, but tough/bitterMale flowers shed pollenGravid female emergesLShe leaves fig - dusted with pollenLEnters 2nd generation of figs-93-LLays eggsLShe dies[September or so]Fertilized females emergeLEnter third generation of figsLInsects emerge in winterIn the fig, we see a complex inter-relationshipbetween a plant and its pollinator. Because it involvespollination and fertilization, it is an example -- acomplicated one -- of sexual reproduction. In thedomesticated figs, many cultivars produce figs withonly female flowers that set seed without pollinationand fertilization have occurred. These figs, like thebananas, have replaced sexual reproduction withasexual reproduction and have parthenocarpic fruits.We have maintained them through the centuriesbecause we like their predictably tasty figs.FIG CULTIVARSKadota Self-pollinated or parthenocarpicMission Self-pollinated or parthenocarpicSmyrna Figs with & flowers onlyCapri Figs with % flowers onlyCapri + Smyrna + rituals and incantations \u00fb figsOTHER TROPICAL FRUITSMANGO. Mangifera indica is native to Asia, where ithas been in cultivation for at least 6000 years. It isone of the few tropical fruits that has beensignificantly improved by cultivation. Some peoplediscover that they are allergic to the skin of themango fruit. This is not surprising when you realizethat the plant is member of the same plant family thatcontains poison-oak and poison-ivy. The toxin is notin the skin itself, but exudes on to the surface whenthe fruit is harvested.PAPAYA. Carica papaya is a native of the New World,to the West Indies more specifically. Its flowers areunisexual and occur on separate trees. There are alsocultivars with bisexual flowers. The fruits containpapain, a digestive enzyme similar to pepsin. Look forit in meat tenderizers.CASHEW. Also native to the New World, Anacardiumoccidentale is now heavily cultivated in the Old World.India is the leading producer. The familiar cashew nutis attached to a larger swollen structure \u2013 the cashewapple. It is also edible, but because it is so perishableit is relatively unknown outside the tropics. The fruitscan cause rashes in sensitive individuals. The cashewis also in the poison-ivy and poison-oak family. Thetoxin is in the shell and it is destroyed when thecashew is roasted.ACKEE OR AKEE. Blighia sapida, a tree of thesoapberry family (Sapindaceae), is named in honor ofLt. William Bligh. It is doubtful that he would bepleased, because this is a poisonous plant thatproduces fruits that are edible only during a shortperiod of their maturation. Fruits can be lethal whentoo ripe. They cause epidemics of poisoning in theCaribbean, calledthe \u201cVomiting Sickness of Jamaica.\u201dDURIAN. Durio zibethinus is native to westernMalaysia.  Its green, spiny fruits usually weigh up to2 kg (5 lbs.) and grow high up on trees 30 m tall.Falling fruits have killed people! We are not the onlyfan of the durian; elephants, tigers, and monkeys areparticularly attracted to its fruits.The durian may be the world\u2019s most notorious fruit.Most people find its smell and taste repulsive. Theodor of mature fruits is so strong that they are bannedin subways, on airplanes, and in public buildings.What does it smell like?' French custard passed through a sewer;' stale vomit;' a civet cat;' a fermented papaya after a fruit-eating bat haspee\u2019d on it; and my personal favorite;' a garbage truck that has run over a skunk in apaper mill town on a damp day!Others express something akin to adulation when discussing its unique qualities. The great naturalistAlfred Russel Wallace, who described himself as a\u201cconfirmed durion eater,\u201d put it this way:\u201c A rich butter-like custard highly flavoured withalmonds gives the best general idea of it, but inter-mingled with it com wafts of flavor that call to mindcream-cheese, onion-sauce, brown-sherry, and otherincongruities. Then there is a rich glutinoussmoothness in the pulp which nothing else possesses,but which adds to its delicacy.

WILD EDIBLES If you drop into almost any bookstore and look in thenatural history section, you are likely to find a recentlypublished book on the identification and preparationof wild edible plants. There is a tremendous interest inthis subject, particularly on the part of impoverishedstudents and others fascinated by a return to a moresimple way of living.We might begin with a simple question. What is anedible plant? The answer is not as easy as you mightthink. Consider our personal preferences in cultivatededible plants. Are we all in agreement that okra,eggplant, and hominy grits are edible? To many of usthey are comparable to slime, cardboard, andwallpaper paste. About all we can do is talk aboutplants that most of us consider edible, realizing thereare many others that we might add to the list.SOME PRECAUTIONSBe sure of the identification of any plant that you eat.It is not only important to avoid poisonous plants, butto know the identity of the plant that you are about toconsume.Make certain that you know the toxic plants of yourarea. Excellent technical and popular references areavailable to assist you in telling the edible from thepoisonous. It can be difficult. The edible plants of thecarrot family are amazingly similar to ones that arelethal. The toxic plants of the lily family closelyresemble some of the popular wild edible ones. Peoplemake these mistakes all the time; some only once!Eat plants that are growing in uncontaminated areas.Avoid plants growing in stagnant waters, thosegrowing in the immediate vicinity of agricultural areasthat might have been sprayed, or those growing insoils high in nitrates or selenium.In some plants, only certain parts are edible, while inothers the entire plant body may be eaten withimpunity.Also, some plants may be eaten without anypreparation, while others require cooking, sometimesinvolving a change of waters. Consult the recipes fordetails.Never eat large quantities of any wild plant that youhave not tried before. Place a small portion in yourmouth, chew it up, and then spit it out. Wait for a fewminutes to see if any unpleasant taste or stingingsensation occurs. If not, chew and swallow a smallpiece of the plant. This time, wait for an hour or so. Ifthe plant passes your personal test, then proceed withsome of the fancy recipes.You should also ignore much of the folklore associatedwith wild edible plants. One of the most dangerousmyths is that you can use other animals' food habitsas a guide. After all, if a bird can eat that plant or ifyou see Bambi browsing on some herb, then it mustbe safe to eat. The digestive system of birds, othermammals, and insects are sufficiently different fromours that they should not be viewed as reliable guides. The notion that plants come color-coded (certaincolors indicate edibility; others toxicity) is also withoutfoundation. Also be leery of the stories about tellingmushrooms from toadstools by the latter's ability todiscolor silver spoons or coins.SOME WILD EDIBLE PLANTS OF CALIFORNIACommon Name Scientific name CommentsUNDERGROUND PLANT PARTSamole Chlorogalum pomeridianum Bulbs, slightly acid unless cookedarrowhead Sagittaria latifolia Tuberous roots;

FORAGE PLANTSI will close this section on food plants by pointing outto you that there is another vastly important categoryof food plants -- those that we feed to ourdomesticated animals, especially horses, dairy cattleand beef cattle. Another way of looking at it is that weuse dairy and beef cattle to transform plants intomeat, milk, and other dairy products. In the UnitedStates alone, forage crops constitute a multibilliondollar industry. It is estimated that more than half ofthe earth's land surface is devoted to pastures andmeadows used for grazing by farm animals.The high cellulose levels of grass stems and leavesmake these tissues relatively difficult for mostanimals, including humans, to digest. However, thebacteria that inhabit the intestinal tracts of manyanimals carry out a fermentation process that reducesthe cellulose to simpler compounds. We also create asuitable environ-ment in which anaerobic fermentationcan occur when we put silage into a silo -- thosecylindrical, observatory-looking structures that yousee in farm country. For all practical purposes,chopped up plant material is pickled by being bathedin organic acids that are produced by the bacteria. Ifdone properly, silage can be stored for years. The endproduct may sound pretty disgusting, but many of usenjoy something that is similarly prepared. It is calledsauerkraut. From the German (sour + cabbage), it ischopped cabbage leaves that have been fermented inbrine.Although a great variety of plants can providepalatable food for our domesticated animals, all of theimportant forage plants are either grasses or legumes.COMMON FORAGE PLANTSCommon Name Scientific Name CommentGRASSES:Bermuda grass Cynodon dactylon Also an aggressive weed and lawn grassBrome grasses Bromus spp. Very important in dry, cool regionsBuffalo grass Buchlo\u00eb dactyloides Native grass of cool, dry prairiesFescues Festuca spp. Well adapted to warm summersKentucky bluegrass Poa pratensis One of the best and most palatableLove grasses Eragrostis spp. Widely used in southern Great PlainsOrchard grass Dactylis glomerata Does well in cool, humid regionsRedtop Agrostis stolonifera One of the best wetland forage grassesReed canary grass Phalaris arundinacea Well adapted to wet areasSorghum Sorghum bicolor Also used for grain, silage, and syrupTimothy Phleum pratense Eurasian; widely plantedWheat grasses Agropyron spp. Good in cool, dry regionsWild ryes Elymus spp. Natives of the Pacific Northwest-104-LEGUMES:Alfalfa Medicago sativa Excellent protein sourceBird's-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus Grows well on poor soilsBush clovers Lespedeza spp. Plants of poor soilsClovers Trifolium spp. Good protein and very palatableCrown vetch Coronilla varia Eurasian; also used for erosion controlSweet clovers Melilotus spp. Drought resistant; good soil buildersVetches Vicia spp. Often used as winter cover crops-105-SECTION 6 ! SPICES, FLAVORINGS, AND SUGAR6.1 - AN OVERVIEW' Most of the spices and flavorings that we usetoday were also used in ancient times.' It is difficult for us now to imagine how preciouscertain spices were in the Middle Ages and theefforts made then to discover where they grewand to control their sale.' Many of them are associated with particularregions of the world and ethnic groups.' Some spices are made by grinding up entireplants, but most of them come from a particularpart, such bark, leaves, seeds, etc.' Spices have little food value.' Some spices and flavorings, such as horseradishand wasabi, can be toxic if consumed in excess.' In addition to their use in the kitchen, spices alsoare used in various medicines to impart apleasant flavor.' Before the invention of refrigeration, spices wereused to mask the unpleasantness of spoilingmeat.' Sugars are carbohydrates, with the ratio ofhydrogen to oxygen being 2:1, as in water.' The effects of refined sugar on the body remaincontroversial, especially its purported addictiveproperties.' Sugars are not the only sweetening agents foundin plants. Some contain proteins or glycosidesthat are 4000 times sweeter than sucrose.6.2 ! SPICES ANDFLAVORINGSSpices are edible materials that are consumed not somuch for their food value as they are for theiraromatic, flavor-producing qualities. They are notnecessities; spices generally have little nutritionalvalue. Many of them are produced in Central America,northern South America, equatorial Africa, andSoutheast Asia. Most spices owe their popularity tothe essential oils that they contain. These oils arehighly aromatic. Chemically they are benzene orterpene derivatives or straight-chain hydrocarbons ofintermediate molecular length, seldom more than 20carbon atoms long. Some may contain sulfur ornitrogen.FUNCTIONSThe major functions of spices are: '  to add variety to our diet;' to disguise the unpleasant taste of bad meat, animportant consideration in warm areas; and' to increase perspiration and salivation, therebycooling the body and perhaps aiding in digestion.Some not so major, but historically interesting, usesof spices include:' as deodorants' for prevention of the plague' for the fumigation of areas before royal visits' for covering up bad breath (once an absoluterequirement before an audience with the Emperorof China)' for embalming the dead, particularly in ancientEgypt' in magical rites of various sorts' in religious purification ceremonies' as ingredients or cosmetic flavorings in medicines' as aphrodisiacs.HISTORYAlmost all of the spices that we use today have beenin use for thousands of years. Until the 14th century,the world spice trade was controlled by the Arabs. Inthe 15th century, Venice took control and it was atabout this time that many spices became known andwidely used in Europe. In the late 1400's, Portugalbecame the leading figure in international spice trade.None of the important spices left the East Indies,except on Portuguese ships. An uprising in 1574ended their rule of the Moluccas, also known as \"TheSpice Islands.\" England soon controlled India and theSpice Islands. This was the era of the founding of thefamous East India Company. The Dutch then tookcontrol of the East Indies and for almost two centuriesthey dominated the distribution of pepper, mostcinnamon, cloves, ginger, mace, and nutmeg. Todaymany of the spices are widely planted and no singlecountry has a monopoly.TIMELINE: SPICE TRADEBCE:5000 Spices used in Middle East3000 Egyptians use spices in embalming2000 Arabs establish monopoly in spice trade1500 Queen Hathepshut of Egypt imports spicesfrom the Land of Punt992 Queen of Sheba brings spices to KingSolomon200 Chinese import cloves from the Spice IslandsCE:410 Fall of Rome610 Arab domination begins (to 1096)812 Charlemagne orders spices planted onimperial farms1096 First Crusade opens trade routes1180 Pepperer\u2019s Guild founded in London1271 Nicolo, Marco, & Maffeo Polo sail for Asia-106-1460 Portuguese bring back grains-of-paradisefrom Africa1492 Columbus sails for the Indies in search of itsprecious spices1498 Vasco de Gama reaches Calicut, India1510 Portuguese gain control of Ceylon (Sri Lanka)1522 Magellan arrives in Spice Islands1560 Overland trade route to Asia re-established1574 Uprising against Portuguese in Spice Islands1579 Sir Francis Drake reaches East Indies1600 British East India Company founded1602 United (Dutch) East India Co. founded1605 Dutch drive Portuguese out of Spice Islands(to 1621)1641 Dutch capture Spice Islands 1651 Dutch begin destroying nutmeg and cloves1770 Pierre Poivre smuggles cloves, etc. from SpiceIslands1795 U.

It is the most popular of the group ofrelated species shown in the table. Onions areprobably native to southwestern Asia. Theircharacteristic flavor and aroma come from a sulfur-containing compound, allicin. The onion is also heldin high regard as a medicinal plant.GARLIC (Allium sativum) is second only to the onionin popularity as a flavoring. It is also native to Asia.Garlic cloves are segments (axillary buds) of theparent bulb, surrounded by a papery sheath. Garlichas a long history of medicinal uses to cure cancer,tuberculosis, athlete's foot, hemorrhoids, and to treathigh blood pressure, and as an aphrodisiac.Sacks of garlic worn about the neck have beenconsidered by some people to be useful in warding offtrolls and vampires. All I can say in this matter is thatnot a single friend of mine who uses garlic has everbeen the attacked by either of these creatures.OTHER \u201cROOTS\u201dGINGER (Zingiber officinalis) is the most important ofthe root spices. It is actually the rhizome that containsthe spice. Ginger, a member of the ginger family(Zingiberaceae), is native to Southeast Asia.TURMERIC (Curcuma longa) is native to SoutheastAsia. It is also a member of the ginger family. Thespice is derived from rhizomes with blunt tubers.Turmeric is immensely popular because it is a principalingredient in curry powder.HORSERADISH (Armoracia rusticana) roots containa very potent glycoside called sinigrin. The plant, amember of the mustard family (Cruciferae), is nativeto southeastern Europe, where it can be a weed.WASABI (Wasabia japonica) is related to thehorseradish, but it is not a kind of horseradish. It isalso known as the Japanese horseradish, which addsto the confusion in common names. This perennialmember of the mustard family grows naturally next tomountain streams; it is cultivated in flooded terraces.The roots are ground to make a green powder orpaste. Most of the wasabi that we are served ishorseradish + mustard + green food coloring. The realwasabi is far too expensive for general use.It is very pungent! One fellow who did not know aboutwasabi thought that it was strange that a Japaneserestaurant would be serving guacamole. Afterconsuming a hearty bite, he ended up in the hospital.SARSAPARILLA (Smilax spp.) is a trailing, pricklyvine native to the New World tropics. The roots yieldthe spice, once widely used in various health tonicsand beverages. The hero in the old western moviesalways ordered this when he found himself in asaloon. The plant belongs to the lily family (Liliaceae).BARKSCINNAMON (Cinnamomum zeylanicum) comes froma tree native to Ceylon and India. The volatile agentis cinnamic aldehyde. Bark is removed by hand afterthe monsoon season. The best material is intact barksections from which the underlying cells have beenremoved. These are the \"quills\" of commerce.Damaged quills and fragments are converted intopowdered cinnamon.CASSIA (Cinnamomum cassia), an ancient spice, isoften confused with true cinnamon. The tree is nativeto Burma. Its bark is loosened, stripped off, and dried.Cassia is used in medicine, flavorings, soaps, andcandies. A significant portion of the cassia crop is soldas cinnamon.SASSAFRAS (Sassafras albidum) comes from a treenative to eastern North America. It has been used toflavor medicines, root beers, soaps, etc. It hasindustrial applications in floor oils and polishing oils.The once popular sassafras tea is now rarely-107-encountered because of its recently discoveredcarcinogenic properties.LEAVESBASIL comes from Ocimum basilicum, a mint nativeto India and Africa. It is much used in stews,dressings, and in mock turtle soup.PEPPERMINT is also derived from a mint, Menthapiperita. It grows wild in Europe, Asia, and NorthAmerica. The plants yield menthol, an essential oilwith wide applications.SPEARMINT is derived from Mentha spicata, a mintnative to Europe and Asia. It is a widely used flavoringmaterial.SAGE (Salvia officinalis) is a mint native to theMediterranean region. It has been a popular culinaryherb since ancient times. The generic name, derivedfrom the Latin verb \"to save,\" tells us of its reputationas a medicinal plant. The specific epithet indicates thatthe plant was listed officially and approved for medicaluse.WINTERGREEN comes from the leaves of a birchtree, Betula lenta. The flavoring derives from aglycoside, methyl salicylate. Originally this popularspice came from  Gaultheria procumbens, a plant ofthe heath family.TARRAGON (Artemisia dracunculus) is an Asian herbthat belongs to the daisy or sunflower family. It is inthe same genus as the sagebrush of our westernstates. Its distinctive bittersweet flavor has made itone of the most popular culinary herbs. Tarragon'spopularity appears to go back only to about the MiddleAges.FLOWERS AND FLOWER BUDSCAPERS are the flower buds of a shrub (Capparisspinosa) native to the Mediterranean. It is alsocultivated in the southern U. S. Caper buds are pickledin salt and strong vinegar.CLOVES are the unopened flowers and attachedsection of stem from Eugenia caryophyllata, a treenative to the Spice Islands. Most cloves now comefrom Zanzibar and the Malagasy Republic. Oil of clovesis obtained by distillation. Eugenol is used in thesynthesis of vanillin, the artificial vanilla flavoring.SAFFRON, from the stigmas and styles of Crocussativus, a relative of the garden crocus, is the mostexpensive of the commonly used spices. It takesabout 70,000 flowers to yield one pound of saffron.The material has also been used as a plant dye.FRUITSALLSPICE is derived from Pimenta dioica, a treenative to the West Indies and Central America. Thecommon name comes from the fact that the spicetastes as though it were a combination of severalflavorings.PEPPERS is the common name used for the fruits ofvarious species of Capsicum, New World members ofthe nightshade family. Because they can be confusedwith black and white pepper, some authors prefer tocall these plants \"capsicums\" or \"capsicum peppers.\"A SUMMARY OF CAPSICUM PEPPERSCommon Name Scientific NameAji C. baccatum var. pendulumAji C. chinenseAnaheim C. annuum var. a.Ancho C. annuum var. a.Banana C. annuum var. a.Bell C. annuum var. a.Bird C. annuum var. glabriusculumBird C. frutescensCascabel C. annuum var. a.Cayenne C. baccatum var. baccatumCayenne C. frutescensChamburoto C. pubescensChile manzana C. pubescensChili C. frutescensChili C. annuum var. a.Chilipiquin C. annuum var. glabriusculumChiltepine C. annuum var. glabriusculumGreen C. annuum var. a.Habanero C. chinenseHungarian wax C. annuum var. a.Jalapeno C. annuum var. a.Mango C. annuum var. a.Mirasol C. annuum var. a.Paprika C. annuum var. a.Peperoni C. annuum var. a.Pepperoncini C. annuum var. a.Peter C. annuum var. a.Pimiento C. annuum var. a.Poblano C. annuum var. a.Rocotillo C. chinenseRocoto C. pubescensSerrano C. annuum var. a.Squash C. annuum var. a.Tabasco C. frutescensTomato C. annuum var. a.

It is a member of the piper orpeperomia family and not at all related to thenightshades. The unripened fruits are hand picked,piled in heaps, and dried in the sun. Naturalfermentation causes the fruits to turn black. The hard,berry-like fruits are called \"peppercorns.\" Commercialblack pepper is made by grinding up the peppercorns.White pepper is made by soaking the ripe peppercornsfor about two weeks. The outer skins are removed andthe smooth, white insides are washed and dried in thesun.VANILLA beans are the unripened, fermented fruitsof Vanilla planifolia, a New World tropical vinebelonging to the orchid family. The essential oil,vanillin, is extracted with alcohol. The Spanish foundvanilla in use by the Aztecs. Bernal Diaz describesMoctozuma using it to flavor a beverage calledchocalatl.THE \"SAVORY SEEDS\"Several plants of the carrot family (Umbelliferae)produce small, seed-like fruits that are commonlyknown as \"savory seeds.\" Some examples are:ANISE from Pimpinella anisum, one of our oldestspices, is used to flavor cakes, pastries, candies, andanisette, a liqueur.CARAWAY, from Carum carvi, is used in baking,medicine, and to make kummel. The plant is native toEurope and Asia.DILL comes from Anethum graveolens, native toEurope and Asia. It is used in cooking and to flavorpickles.FENNEL, a common roadside weed in our area,comes from Foeniculum vulgare, a native of theMediterranean region. All parts of the plant arearomatic. It is widely used in cooking.SEEDSWHITE MUSTARD, from Sinapis alba, containssinalbin, a glycoside. When combined with water, ityields a non-volatile sulfur compound that imparts thecharacteristic taste. White mustard is used in medicineand as a condiment.BLACK MUSTARD is derived from Brassica nigra, aEurasian plant. It is now widely cultivated. The seedscontain sinigrin, which will produce a volatile sulfurcompound when it breaks down. It is exceedinglypowerful and can cause great damage to the sensitivelinings of the digestive tract. Black mustard has astimulating effect on the salivary glands and on theperistaltic action of our gastrointestinal tract. Theground mustard that we typically purchase is often amixture of black and white mustards.NUTMEG comes from Myristica fragrans, a tree nativeto the Spice Islands. It was unknown to most of theancient world. Most nutmeg is now grown on Grenada,an island in the West Indies. The seeds also containpsychoactive compounds.MACE comes from the very same tree. Whereasnutmeg is the seed, mace is the brightly-coloredtissue (aril) that surrounds the seed.SPICES AND FLAVORINGSCommon Name (Scientific Name) Part Used Commentsachiote  (Bixa orellana) seeds See annattoallspice  (Pimenta dioica) fruits Not a mixture, as commonly thoughtangelica  (Angelica archangelica) roots Used to flavor vermouthangostura  (Galipea officinalis) bark Flavoring in alcoholic/soft drinksanise  (Pimpinella anisum) fruits* Used in anisetteannatto  (Bixa orellana) seeds From tropical America;

SUGAR & OTHERSWEETENERSIn everyday language, sugar is a sweet, crystallinesolid used to flavor food, to hide disagreeable tastes,and in a variety of industrial processes. Within theplant body, sugar is an intermediate, soluble,transportable form of food. Sugars are kinds ofcarbohydrates. To a chemist, carbohydrates arepolyhydroxyaldehydes or ketone alcohols. To the restof us, they are organic compounds made up of carbon,hydrogen, and oxygen, with the hydrogen and oxygentypically occurring in a ratio of 2:1, as they do inwater.It is convenient to divide carbohydrates into twosubgroups: sugars and polysaccharides. Sugarshave simpler structures and lower molecular weights.The simplest sugars are called monosaccharides,sugars that cannot be broken down (hydrolyzed) intoeven simpler sugars. Dissacharides, on the otherhand, yield two monosaccharide sugars on hydrolysis;trisaccharides break down into three, and so on. Thepolysaccharides are chemically more complex, oftenrepresented graphically as long chains of repeatingchemical units. Two very common examples ofpolysaccharides are starch and cellulose. Starch canbe thought of as the principal food storage form inliving plants. It can be chemically converted back intosimpler, more directly usable sugars. More aboutstarch later. Cellulose is an inert material. It is thechief component of plant cell walls. It, too, is of greateconomic importance. Cotton fibers are essentiallypure cellulose. It is the main constituent in wood.There are many kinds of sugars, including dextrose,also called corn sugar or grape sugar; fructose orfruit sugar or levulose, which occurs in honey and inmany fruits; glucose, the kind found in karo syrups;lactose or milk sugar; sucrose, also known as canesugar or beet sugar; and xylose or wood sugar, whichis made by boiling corn cobs, straw, etc. Far andaway, the most economically important of thesesugars is sucrose, a disaccharide made up of glucoseand fructose. World production is about 111 millionmetric tons of raw sugar each year, from theprocessing of about 1 billion metric tons of cane and282 million metric tons of sugar beets. These twoplants concentrate enough sucrose in the jointedstems of the sugar cane and in the swollen taproot ofsugar beets to make extraction economically feasible.TIMELINE: SUGAR & SWEETENERSBCE:10000 Sugar cane domesticated510 Persian tablet provides first account of solidsugar useCE:1493 Columbus brings sugar cane to New World1523 Cane first grown in Cuba1532 Cane first grown in Brazil1605 Oliver de Serres discovers beet juice similar tosugar syrup1751 Sugar cane first planted in U.

It spread from its ancestral home to China,then to Java, and to the islands of the Pacific. Sugarcane was brought to the New World by Columbus onhis second voyage. It was first planted in the UnitedStates in New Orleans in 1751. Now it is grown inwarm areas around the world.Sugar cane is vegetatively propagated by plantingsections of stems with buds. It generally takes about1 to 1.5 years to get a crop. Current production isalmost 1 billion metric tons per year worldwide. Canerequires a great deal of water -- 2 metric tons ofwater to produce 1 kg of sugar. Plants are subject toa number of diseases and pests, including rats.PROCESSING. The crop was traditionally harvestedby hand, often by slaves. Because of the terribleconditions under which they worked, one authorityestimated that 1 ton of sugar cost the life of oneslave. Today, manual labor is still used, but so is agreat deal of specialized equipment.The processing of sugar cane consists of two phases:MillingStems washed, chopped, shredded, andpressed between giant rollersLStems chopped more finelyLSoaked in hot watersqueezed  to extract more sugarLCrushed stem fiber remains (bagasse) burned to make steam to run millLLime added and the mixture heatedLFibers and soil settle out or float to surfaceL Juice pumped to evaporatorsLLoss of water yields a thick, dark syrupLPumped to vacuum pansLMore evaporation occursLSyrup boiled down to form massecuite(solid sugar crystals and liquid molasses)LMassecuite centrifuged to separatesolid and liquid phasesLSugar crystals washed (removes film of molasses)LSpinning and drying(just what it sounds like)All of the steps so far are accomplished at the mill,often located in a tropical or subtropical area close tothe sugar cane plantations. Most of them were builtmany years ago and they tend to look prettydisreputable. The product at this stage is unrefinedraw sugar. It is about 96% sucrose, a disaccharideconsisting of fructose and glucose. It also containssoil, microbes, and various other contaminants. TheFood and Drug Administration says that it is unfit forhuman consumption. Turbinado is a partially refinedform of sugar. It is washed with steam duringcentrifugation. Molasses, from the Latin for honey-like, is the syrup that remains after sucrose has beencrystallized. Its darker color comes from carmelizationand the high temperature during boiling.RefiningThe refining of raw sugar typically occurs in a separatefacility, often located somewhere far removed fromthe mill.Raw sugar melted to reform syrupLFiltered twice to yield a colored syrupLBoiled in vacuum pansLCentrifugedLAir-driedLFiltered again(diatomaceous earth, carbon black,and ground bone)Brown sugar is a form of refined  sugar. Syrup hasbeen added to the processed sucrose and it isredissolved and recrystallized. A fine molasses filmremains on the sugar crystals. The sugar industryonce claimed brown sugar was so contaminated thatit should never be eaten.Average consumption of sucrose in the United Statesis about 136 lbs per person annually or about 450calories per day. Large amounts of sugar, and somepeople eat about 4 lbs/week, can meet the body'senergy needs. Consuming sugar in this amount caninhibit starch and fiber-converting enzymes. Ourstomachs then find it more difficult to digest starchand fiber. Some argue that we can become addictedto refined sugar. Some authorities believe that thereis a strong correlation between high sugarconsumption that high alcohol intake outside ofregular meals.BEET SUGARBeet sugar is derived from the swollen taproots ofBeta vulgaris var. altissima, a relative of the edibletable beet. The wild beet of northern Europe, Betamaritima, is presumably ancestral to both of them. Itwas not until the latter part of the 18th century thatthe potential of the sugar beet was realized. In thefollowing years, the chemical nature of its sugar wasfound to be identical to that of sugar cane andintensive breeding programs began. In 1993, we grew282 million metric tons of sugar beets. Sugar beetsare grown in the temperate parts of the world. Franceis the leading producer, which is not unexpected whenwe recall the edict of Napoleon Bonaparte.Extraction ProcessTopping (removal of the leaf cluster)LThorough washingLShredding taprootsLSoak material in hot water(most soluble sugar diffuses into water)LRemove impurities(add lime, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide)LFilterL-112-Concentrate clear liquid that results to yieldcrystalline sucrose.The residue that remains makes an excellent cattlefeed. As in sugar cane, the raw sugar obtained fromsugar beets is brown and must be refined to createwhite sugar. Two hundred years ago, sugar beetscontained about 6% sucrose. Today's improvedvarieties can produce up to 20% sugar.MAPLE SUGARThe indigenous peoples of North America had used thesugar maple (Acer saccharinum), and to a lesserextent, the black maple, as the source of a sweeteningagent. They made cuts in the bark of the trees in theearly spring. The sap that oozed out was collected andconcentrated by dropping hot rocks into it or byfreezing the sap and removing the layer of sugary icethat formed each day. Early European settlersmodified the procedure by drilling holes in the treesand by boiling the sap down in iron kettles. Today weuse power drills, perhaps even the battery-poweredmodels! Final processing occurs in the \"sugar house,\"where the maple sap is concentrated even more in anevaporator to yield maple syrup. If boiled evenfurther, the product will be the crystalline solid calledmaple sugar.Maple sugar is mostly sucrose. The sugar content ofthe sap is only about 2-6%, much lower than that ofcane or beets. One reason why maple sugar is soexpensive is that it takes about 40 gallons of sugarmaple sap to make one gallon of maple syrup. One ofthe major users of maple syrup is the tobaccoindustry, as a flavoring in its products.OTHER SWEETENERSPerhaps fueled by the controversy about the healthhazards of sucrose, some attention has been turned toplants that yield sweeteners other than ordinarysugars. The West African plant Thaumatococcusdaniellii, an herb in the prayer plant family(Marantaceae), contains a protein that is up to 4000times sweeter than sucrose. From that same region,a second plant called Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii,yields another protein that is 800-3000 times sweeterthan cane sugar. Stevia rebaudiana, a South Americanmember of the sunflower family, contains stevioside,a glycoside up to 300 times as sweet as sucrose. Alittle closer to home, Lippia dulcis, of the vervain orverbena family native to Mexico, has a compound inits leaves and flowers that is 1000 sweeter.-113-SECTION 7.0 ! BEVERAGE  PLANTS7.1 ! AN OVERVIEW' There are three major groups of beverages thatwe derive from plants: fruit juices and those thatcontain caffeine or alcohol.' Many widely used beverage plants are relativelyunknown here in the United States.' The ethyl alcohol in beer, wine, and distilledbeverages is a byproduct (which sounds betterthan waste product) of microscopic yeasts.' Caffeine acts as a stimulant to the centralnervous system.' Alcohol is not so easily categorized. It can be adepressant or a stimulant, and has other effectsas well.' Both caffeine and alcohol fit comfortably withinthe usual definition of a drug.' The ill effects of alcohol abuse are well-established.' Linkage of caffeine consumption with heartdisease, high blood pressure, etc. remainscontroversial.7.2 ! CAFFEINATEDBEVERAGES\u201cIt is probably significant that the most widespreadwords in the world \u2013 borrowed into virtually everylanguage \u2013 are the names of the four great caffeineplants: coffee, cacao, cola, and tea.\u201d(E. N. Andes, \u201cThe Food of China\u201d)' ' ' ' 'We have developed a number of non-alcoholicbeverages from plants. There is an almost endless listof fruit juices. They are, however, of rather minoreconomic importance when compared to the threeleading nonalcoholic drinks -- tea, coffee, andchocolate. These drinks contain alkaloids,physiologically active compounds containing nitrogen.If you examine a structural representation of theirmolecules, you will see that they have a ring of carbonatoms.CAFFEINE & RELATEDALKALOIDS The principal alkaloid in coffee, tea, and chocolate iscaffeine, technically known as 1, 3, 7-trimethyl-xanthine. It has been called the most widely usedpsychoactive material on earth. In the United States,we consume about one quarter of the world's supply,about 211 milligrams per person per day (about threetimes the world's average).Two other chemically similar alkaloids may also befound in caffeine-bearing plants. They aretheobromine and theophylline. Collectively they areoften called the xanthine alkaloids.CAFFEINE CONTENTWe encounter caffeine in various foods, beverages,medicines, and weight-control aids.

Caffeine acts by inhibitingadenosine, a naturally-occurring tranquilizer in thebrain. It appears to dislodge adenosine from receptorsites. A recent paper suggests that the effects of ourfirst cup of coffee in the morning are really those ofcompensating for the first stages of withdrawalsymptoms that began while we were asleep and notreplenishing the supply of caffeine to our centralnervous system.In large doses, caffeine can cause:' nausea' vomiting-114-' insomnia' restlessness' tinnitus (ringing in the ears)' tremors' scintillating scotoma (\"island of blindness\")' rapid heart action' irregular heart beat, and' diuresis.Tolerance and habituation may develop fromprolonged use.

Cancer Inst. reports inhibitory effects ongrowth of tumorsTea or cha, from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, wasonce the most widely consumed caffeinated drink inthe world. Now it is second only to the cola beverages.The plant is native to Southeast Asia, perhaps China.Tea has had a long history. At first it was strictly amedicinal plant. It was not until about the 5th centuryA.D. that tea became popular in Asia as a drink. Itremained relatively unknown in Western Europe untilthe 16th or 17th century. Today China remains theleading producer; India and Ceylon the chiefexporters.The tea plant is a small tree that is usually keptpruned back as a shrub. It is often grown under theshade of some other plant on the hillsides of tropicaland subtropical areas. The leaves are produced influshes. After the third or fourth year, the flushes areplucked. This consists of removing a section of theyoung shoot bearing three or four young leaves andthe terminal bud. The plucking stimulates the lateralbuds to produce shoots. After about ten years, theplant is cut back to the ground and sucker shoots takeover. The harvesting is done by hand in mostinstances, although machinery is used in some areas.It is important not to bruise the young leaves.There was, by the way, a version known as \u201cImperialPlucking.\u201d Tea for the Emperor of Japan was pluckedby virgin women who wore special gloves and usedscissors of gold to remove the bud and youngest leaf.They were placed on a golden platter to dry.PROCESSING OF BLACK TEAWitheringLRollingL-115-SortingLFermentationLDryingLSortingLGradingAfter the leaves have been removed from the plant,they are spread out on trays to wilt. Once again it isessential to prevent bruising so as to avoidfermentation. Temperature during the withering phasemust be precisely controlled. Once the leaves havewilted, they are rolled under pressure to separatethem from the stem tips and to crush them. Thecrushing helps to distribute the sap within the leaf.This also initiates fermentation. A preliminary sizing orsorting also occurs at this point. The partiallyfermented and sized leaves are placed on screen-bottom trays. During this fermentation phase thetemperature is kept between 21-25EC and the relativehumidity at about 90%. Many very important bio-chemical changes occur during the fermentationprocess. The tea leaves are then dried for 20-25minutes at 90-100EC. The final grading involvesjudging the aroma, uniformity, and appearance of theleaves along with the taste, color, and aroma of theinfusion made from the leaves.Green tea is processed much the same as black tea,except that the freshly plucked leaves are heated toinhibit fermentation. The oolong teas are partiallyfermented. Black tea is the most commonly producedtype.Because of local variation in quality, differences inquality over a period of time, and local tastepreferences, most of the commonly consumed teashave leaves from a wide variety of sources blendedtogether.Bubble tea or boba milk tea or tapioca milk tea is arecent fad imported from Taiwan. It is tea, milk,sugar, and black tapioca pearls, served cold.Tea leaves contain up to 5% caffeine or theine andabout 20% tannins. There are also dextrins, pectins,cellulose, and other structural materials. After a fiveminute infusion the tea leaf yields about half of thetannins, 3/4 of the caffeine, and about half of theother extractable solids.THE TEA CEREMONYThe Japanese tea ceremony, adapted from an earlierritual developed by the Chinese, is based on the Zenprinciple of adoration of the beautiful and the routine.The setting is a tea house in a garden or special roommade of specific materials and configuration. Typicallythere are hanging scrolls, flowers, and a sunkenfireplace. Participants enter along path of pavingstones, walk silently, and leave behind their worldlyconcerns. The host extends a silent greeting. A lightmeal is served. Water is heated over a charcoal stove.The host presents the tea utensils that will be used.Green tea (matcha) is now prepared. Everyone drinksfrom a communal bowl, usually taking three servings.The teapot, spoon, and other implements are  washedand put away. The host now offers cake and a weakertea. This sets the stage for silent contemplation of thefire and the surroundings. The host now takes gueststo threshold of the tea house where there is a ritualrinsing of mouth and hands.COFFEE\u201cOne need only compare the violent coffee-drinkingsocieties of the West to the peace-loving tea drinkerof the Orient to realize the pernicious and malignanteffect that bitter brew has upon the human soul.\u201d(Anonymous Hindu dietary tract)\u201cCoffee should be black as Hell, strong as death andsweet as love.\u201d (Turkish proverb)\"They have in Turkey a drink called coffee.

About 80% of all coffeeproduced comes from South America; half of it fromBrazil. Coffee is second only to tea in world popularity.In the U.S. it is a much more popular drink. About 75-90% of all coffee beans processed come from Coffeaarabica. This shrub is native to Ethiopia, not Arabia asthe epithet suggests. Much of the remainder is derivedfrom \"Robusta Coffee\" (C. canephora), which is usedprincipally to make instant coffee. Other speciesutilized are \"Liberian coffee\" (C. liberica) and \"Excelsacoffee\" (C. excelsa).Coffee beans were first used as a food, the seedsbeing eaten on long trips to ward off fatigue. It wasnot until the 15th century that coffee became popularas a drink.The coffee plant is a shrub or small tree. Like tea, it isoften grown in the shade of other plants. Trees beginto bear fruit after about three years. The fruits aregreen at first, and after about a nine monthmaturation period, they turn a bright red. At thisstage they are often called cherries. The fruit consistsof an outer skin (exocarp), a pulpy flesh (mesocarp),and a hard bony inner layer, the parchment(endocarp), which surrounds the seeds. The seed coatitself is called the silverskin. Processing of the coffeebean involves getting rid of these layers surroundingthe seeds.PROCESSINGThere are two methods of processing the cherries. Thesimplest is the dry method. The fruits are spread outin the sun to dry for 15-25 days. They are thendehulled. The more commonly employed wet methodinvolves several steps. The cherries are first pulped.This removes the outer skin and much of themucilaginous flesh. The seeds surrounded by theparchment and some adhering pulp are graded bytheir specific gravity into various size classes andplaced in fermentation tanks for 12-24 hours. Thefermentation removes any remaining pulp from theparchments. The coffee beans are then washedcarefully and dried. This drying stage is traditionallydone on a \"coffee drying floor.\" Sun-drying usuallytakes 8-10 days. Artificial heaters are also used. Thefinal stage of processing is curing. It consists ofremoving the parchment from the seeds, polishing,and a final grading.WET PROCESSING METHOD\u201cCherries\u201d pulped(outer skin and pulp removed)LSort by sizeLFermentLWashLDry(drying floor or oven)LMilling and polishing(remove parchment and silver skin)LFinal gradingLShippedLRoastedCoffee, like tea, is usually blended to local tastes. Theseeds contain 1-1.5% caffeine, not as much as in tealeaves. An essential oil, caffeol, imparts thecharacteristic aroma and flavor. Coffee seeds alsocontain glucose, dextrins, and various proteins.DECAFFEINATIONMaking decaffeinated coffee begins with unroastedbeans that are steam-softened. They are then flushedwith a solvent for about an hour. Until the mid-1970'strichloroethylene was used; now it is  methylenechloride or ethyl acetate. The solvent is drained awayand the beans are steamed to evaporate the residue.This phase may be repeated as many as 24 times. Thefinal product is about 97% caffeine-free (0.08% vs.1.0-2.0%).KINDS OF COFFEE PREPARATIONSSome people have suggested that we blame Frasierand Niles Crane for the increased interest in exotic,yuppie kinds of coffee. Especially here along thePacific Coast, we have many opportunities to samplethem.Espresso is a strong, dark-roast coffee that is brewedunder pressure.Cappuccino is an Italian espresso coffee that istopped with steamed, foamed milk. Some of the milkis mixed into the coffee. Cocoa or cinnamon is oftenadded to the foam.Caf\u00e9 latte is similar to cappuccino, except that thesteamed and foamed milk is mixed throughout. Caf\u00e9 au lait is made from a strong coffee orespresso; it is about half coffee and half milk. Caf\u00e9 mocha is caf\u00e9 latte with chocolate added.Caf\u00e9 con leche is a very strong black coffee to whichhot milk is added.Caf\u00e9 amaretto is a black coffee that is flavored withamaretto, cloves, citrus rinds, and cinnamon.Caf\u00e9 brulot is a black coffee that is flavored withsugar, citrus rinds, cloves, cinnamon, and brandy. Itis set on fire and allowed to flame briefly. Look for itin New Orleans.Caf\u00e9 macchiato is an espresso with just a dollop ofsteamed milk foam on the topCaf\u00e9 Normande is black coffee flavored by Calvados,an apple brandy from Calvados, Normandy.Caf\u00e9 royale is like a caf\u00e9 brulot, but it is not set onfire. It may also be bourbon- and sugar-flavoredcoffee.-117-By the way, caf\u00e9 is the French, Spanish, andPortuguese  word for coffee and the place where it issold is called a caf\u00e9teria.COFFEE AND YOUR HEALTHIs coffee good for you? Certainly it can be drunk toexcess. What about more moderate consumption \u2013two to four cups a day? Below is an attempt tosummarize recent studies, which often seem tocontradict one another.Too much coffee may cause:1986: Phobias, panic attacks1990: Heart attacks, stress, osteoporosis1991: Underweight babies, hypertension1992: Higher cholesterol1993: Miscarriages1994: Intensified stress1995: Delayed conception2000: ArthritisCoffee may also help prevent or treat:1988: Asthma1990 Colon and rectal cancer, impotence1992 Mental sluggishness, heart disease(instant only)1996 Fatal car accidents, suicide1999 Gallstones, heart disease2000 Parkinson\u2019s DiseaseSource: Time Magazine: 05 June 2000CACAO\u201cThe divine drink which builds up resistance and fightsfatigue. A cup of this precious drink permits a man towalk for a whole day without food.\u201d[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]\u201cThis cacao, when much is drunk, when much isconsumed, especially that which is green, ... makesone drunk,... dizzy, confuses one, makes one sick,deranges one. When an ordinary amount is drunk, itgladdens one, refreshes one, consoles one, in-vigorates one. Thus it is said: \u2018I take cacao. I wet mylips. I refresh myself.\u201d[Bernardino de Sahagun, 16th century]\u201cThe beverage of the gods was ambrosia; that of manis chocolate. Both increase the length of life in aprodigious manner.\u201d[Louis Lewin, \u201cPhantastica\u201d]' ' ' ' 'First, a word about easily confused common names.The plant itself is a cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). Byprocessing its seeds, we obtain products that we callcocoa and chocolate. The South American shrub thatbears the coca leaf, the source of cocaine, is acompletely unrelated plant.Cacao is a small tree native to the New World tropics.The Aztecs made a drink from it called xocoatl; theMayans made kakaw. These were very popular drinkslong before the Conquest. They also used it as amoney substitute. The usual Aztec recipe called forcacao, maize, water, and capsicums. The maize wasused because the cacao seeds contained so much fat.This concoction was relatively unpalatable to theSpaniards. It was not until the Dutch broke a virtualSpanish monopoly that cacao even became known tomost Europeans. Cacao did not become popular inEurope until someone discovered that it could beimproved by adding sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla.PROCESSINGProcessing of cacao begins with the harvesting of thefruits. This is done by hand. The fruits are often splitopen immediately and the seeds removed. The seedsare then fermented, either by placing them in largepiles in the open, or by putting them in specialfermentation tanks. This process helps to removepulpy material from around the seeds. They are thenwashed, dried, and packaged for export. Finalprocessing usually occurs in the U.S. or Europe. Thisconsists of the seeds being cracked open and themeat expressed to yield the oils and fats, the cocoabutter. It is used in everything from suntan lotions tohemorrhoid medicines. The remaining cake is thesource of commercial chocolate. Cacao seeds containtheobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine), an alkaloidrelated to caffeine.Today West Africa is the leading cacao productioncenter. Ghana produces about 35% of the world'ssupply; Nigeria about 14%. The United States andUnited Kingdom use about half.The chocolate industry was helped considerably bytwo discoveries. In 1828 C. J. van Houten discoveredthe process for removing the excess fat from seeds. In1876, M. D. Peter of Switzerland formulated milkchocolate by adding dried milk.Initial Processing:Extract seedsLFermentLClean/dry seedsLRoast (121E C)LSeparate nibs from shellsLGrindLCake + liquorLSecond grindLPressLCocoa butter + cakeFinal Processing:Option 1:Cocoa butterLAdd liquor and sugarLConchLSweet chocolateOption 2:Cocoa butterLAdd liquor, sugar, milk solidsLConch-118-LMilk chocolateOption 3:Cocoa cakeLPulverizeLCocoa powderCOLA BEVERAGESCola nitida is a tree native to the rain forests of Africa.Its seeds contain caffeine (up to 3.5%), theobromine(less than 1%), and kolanin, a glycoside. Cola nutextracts were once used to flavor the various coladrinks. Now most of these use flavorings,theobromine, and caffeine from other sources. Most ofthe cola nuts are produced in Africa and Jamaica.While the chewing of coca leaves never becamepopular in Europe and North America, various drinkswith coca leaf extracts did. John Styth Pemberton wasa pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia. He was also a CivilWar veteran who had become addicted to morphine,as had so many of his compatriots. Pemberton wasaware of the research that indicated that cocainecould cure morphine addiction and that it had otherhealthful properties. Earlier he had concocted a seriesof patent medicines with colorful names, such asTriplex Liver Pills, Globe Flower Cough Syrup, IndianQueen Hair Dye, and my personal favorite, BotanicBlood Balm.Noting the success of Vin Mariani (see the discussionof cocaine), Pemberton formulated a drink calledFrench Wine Coca, which he described as \u201can idealtonic and stimulant.\u201d He placed it on the market in1881. He claimed that it cured addiction to opiates,was effective in the treatment of alcoholism, and wasdrunk by thousands of the world\u2019s leading scientists.What a testimonial! In 1885 the good citizens ofAtlanta voted to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages,which meant that Pemberton\u2019s coca-fortified wine wasnow illegal. He came up with a new recipe that wasalcohol-free. His accountant, Frank Robinson,suggested that he name the new beverage after itstwo exotic ingredients \u2013 coca leaf and the kola nut.With a little bit of purposeful creative misspelling,Coca Cola was born. In 1891, Pemberton sold hisrights and the secret recipe to Asa Griggs Chandler for$2300. Coca Cola also has a less well known reputation. Thecompany itself claimed that it was \u201ca most wonderfulinvigorator of the sexual organs,\u201d which led to astrange trial in 1909 when the government chargedthat the drink caused young boys to masturbate. Itwas also popular with young women who picked up onthe rumor that Coca Cola, when used as a doucheafter intercourse, was an effective spermicide. Thescientific literature on cocaine as an aphrodisiac ismurky. Its ability to kill sperm has not beendemonstrated.Modern day Coca Cola does not contain cocaine, butit still has coca leaf flavoring in it. A plant in NewJersey, run by a subsidiary of Coca Cola, processesabout 175,000 kg of the trujillo coca leaf each year toremove its cocaine. They refer to the leaves as\u201cMerchandise No. 5\u201d (Streatfeild, 2001). You mayrecall that in the 1980's, we saw a new version ofCoke for sale, but that it failed and it was replaced by\u201cClassic Coke.\u201d The recipe that failed had no coca leafflavoring in it.MINOR CAFFEINATEDBEVERAGESMAT\u00c9. Ilex paraguariensis, also called yerba mat\u00e9 andJesuit tea, is a shrub related to English holly. It isprobably the world's 4th most popular drink. It is verywidely used in South America, where it is native. Theleaves contain about 1.5% caffeine. Mat\u00e9 is becomingmore popular in the U.S.GUARAN\u00c1. This is the \u201cBrazilian cocoa\u201d or the \"cola\"of Brazil. Paullinia cupana is a twining shrub that haslong been used by the local Indians. It has 3-4 timesmore caffeine than either tea or coffee. In recentyears it has found its way into North Americanmarkets, often as one of the ingredients in beveragesthat health-conscious folks drink.7.3 ! ALCOHOLICBEVERAGES(FERMENTED)The use of beverages containing alcohol has alwaysbeen part of our culture. In addition to the verycommon social aspects of drinking alcoholicbeverages, we have also used them in a ceremonialand religious context. We first encountered alcoholperhaps through the accidental discovery of naturallyfermented substances. The fact that yeast wasnecessary for these natural processes to occur musthave been appreciated early on. It has beensuggested by some authors that yeast was our firstcultivated plant.THE PLAYERSOrganism Where Used?Aspergillus oryzeae Sak\u00e9, miso, soy sauceAspergillus soyae Soy sauceSaccharomyces cerevisiae Beer/breadSaccharomyces carlsburgensis BeerSaccharomyces ellipsoideus WineSaccharomyces sake Sak\u00e9Saccharomyces exiguis BreadSaccharomyces beticus Fino sherriesSaccharomyces theobromae CacaoLeuconostoc mesenteroides SauerkrautLactobacillus plantarum SauerkrautLactobacillus sanfrancisco Sour dough breadFERMENTATIONIn the beginning, we had only fermented beverages.Fermentation is a biochemical process by which awide variety of carbohydrate sources are acted uponby naturally occurring or cultivated strains of yeasts(Saccharomyces spp.). We use these organismsbecause they: (1) are efficient producers of alcohol,(2) can tolerate higher levels of ethanol in theirenvironment than many other fungi, and (3) alsomake other compounds that affect the taste offermented beverages. They live in an anaerobic-119-(oxygen-free) condition. Yeasts ingest sugar andnitrogenous compounds produced by other organisms.They metabolize 6-carbon simple sugars. They cannotbreak down starch directly; it must be metabolized forthem. This usually means that one or more enzymesmust be present.During fermentation, sugars are broken down intoethanol (ethyl alcohol), carbon dioxide, fusel oils(alcohols of long chain-lengths), acetaldehyde, aceticacid, and various sulfur-containing compounds. About47% of the sugar is converted into alcohol. With anunlimited supply of sugar, the alcohol level can reachabout 14-18%. In a sense, the yeasts are swimmingabout in alcohol, a waste product of their lifeprocesses. When the alcohol concentration reachesapproximately 18-19%, the yeasts are killed by it andthe fermentation process stops. This is the reason forthe comparatively low alcohol content of beer, wine,and other fermented drinks.FERMENTATION: THE RECIPE(Joseph Gay-Lussac, 1810)C6 H12 O6 \u00fb 2 C2 H5 OH + 2 CO2Sugar \u00fb ethyl alcohol + carbon dioxideMuch of our modern understanding of fermentationrests on the work of Louis Pasteur (1822-1895), theFrench chemist and bacteriologist. In a series ofexperiments, he found that: (1) grape juice will notferment into wine in the absence of yeast cells, and(2) \"... fermentation by yeast is the directconsequence of ... life.\" Pasteur trapped air-borneyeast cells so that he could examine them under themicroscope. Pasteurization is the process that hedeveloped for destroying microorganisms and therebyarresting fermentation. It involves heating milk orsome other material to about 140E F.ALCOHOL CONTENTBeverage % AlcoholFermented:Beer 3.5-6.0Ale 6.0-8.0Hard cider 8.0-12.0Wine and fortified wine 10.0-22.0Distilled:Whiskey 40.0-55.0Brandy 40.0-55.0Rum 40.0-55.0Gin 40.0-55.0Vodka 40.0-55.0[After Der Marderosian & Liberti (1988), p. 32]ALCOHOL AND ITS EFFECTS\u201cI have made an important discovery... alcohol, takenin sufficient quantities, produces all the effects ofintoxication.\u201d (Oscar Wilde, \u201cIn Conversation\u201d)\u201cAn alcoholic is someone you don\u2019t like who drinks asmuch as you do.\u201d (Dyan Thomas)\u201cAlcohol ... enables Parliament to do things at 11 atnight that no sane person would do at 11 in themorning.\u201d (George Bernard Shaw)' ' ' ' 'Alcohol is a non-selective depressant of the centralnervous system. At first, it has a slightly stimulatingeffect, but this is followed by a much more prolongeddulling of the senses. In low to moderate doses, thereis little evidence of long lasting, harmful effects. Whatconstitutes \"low to moderate\" remains a matter ofdebate. Several experts have spoken of the efficacy ofone or two glasses of red wine per day.Ethanol is soluble in water and fats. It moves easilythrough membranes. Almost all of the alcohol that weimbibe is absorbed in our stomach and large intestine.Typically we drink alcohol faster than our system canbreak it down to carbon dioxide and water. Thealcohol levels in our body simply rise. This leads to afeeling of general numbness, which we perceive as asense of relaxation.Drinking can produce disorientation, reducedjudgmental ability, and loss of reasoning. It can alsolead to permanent physical damage characterized by:' lowering of the body's resistance to disease(especially tuberculosis);' a progressive destruction of liver tissue andaccompanying formation of sclerotic tissue(cirrhosis of the liver); hepatic coma;' nervous complications;' physical and psychological dependence; and' an increased chance of having a stroke.The recently described \"fetal alcohol syndrome\" high-lights the effects of alcohol on the developing youngof women who drink during their pregnancies. Therecan be little doubt that alcohol is a drug -- a legal one.BEER\u201cA meal of bread, cheese and beer constitutes thechemically perfect food.\u201d [Queen Elizabeth I]\u201cBeer is proof that God loves us and wants us to behappy.\u201d [Benjamin Franklin]' ' ' ' 'Beer, in the broad sense, is an alcoholic beverage thatis made by fermenting the carbohydrates found a widevariety of plants. In its simplest form:carbohydrate + water + enzymes \u00fb beerBy carbohydrates I mean the starches and sugarsfound in the roots, tubers, stems, and fruits of a longlist of plants. Enzymes are needed to break down thecarbohydrate. They occur when wild or cultivatedstrains of yeast are present. We also found out severalmillennia ago that the enzymes in our saliva will dothe trick.The brands of beer popular in this country aretypically made from a cereal as the carbohydratesource. They are also typically flavored with hops.PROCESSING OF MALTED BEERSTo prepare the malt, a cereal grain (usually barley) is -120-washed and cleaned, then steeped in vats of water forabout two days. The grains are then germinated undercontrolled conditions. This stage usually lasts four tosix days. When the primary root has emerged,germination is stopped by drying the grains in kilns.Grains are steeped in water, germinated, ground up,and dried. The result is malt. The enzymes in thesesprouted grains break down the carbohydrate materialthat is added to it. A carbohydrate source (adjunct), such as rice, corn,wheat, or potatoes, is added to the malt. The mixtureoften consists of about 65% malt and 35% adjunct.This combination is called the mash. The liquidportion of the mash is the wort. After it is drawn off,the barley grains are collected, dried, and used ascattle feed.Most American beers are not only malted, but alsohopped, which means that the wort is boiled with hopsfor two or three hours. Hops is made from the bractssurrounding the female flowers of Humulus lupulus, avine in the hemp family (Cannabaceae). California isone of the main producers of hops in the U. S. Itimparts the characteristic bitter flavor to beer andhelps to clarify it. Clarification is the coagulation ofnitrogen-containing materials in the wort. Most of ourbeers do not have a high hops content; Europeanversions are usually much higher.The cooled wort is now placed in large tanks where itis inoculated with a select strain of Saccharomycescerevisiae, a yeast. It will act on the wort to producecarbon dioxide, ethyl alcohol, and minor organicconstituents. At this stage, the fermented beer iscalled green beer. After a couple of days of initialfermentation, the green beer is transferred to lageringvats where a secondary fermentation occurs. Duringthis several day process, various organic materialscoagulate as scum. The beer is then aged for a periodlasting from a few weeks to a few months. Young beermay be added just before bottling to bring thecarbonation to a desired level or carbon dioxide maybe artificially added. The beer is then filtered andusually pastuerized. Draft beer is not pastuerized. Thefinal product is about 5% ethyl alcohol (ethanol), 90%water, along with maltose (a sugar), gums, dextrins,and various nitrogenous substances.THE BREWING PROCESSBarley soaked and germinatedLSteeped in warm water 2-3 daysLPartly germinated grain (malt) heated and driedLStore 20-30 daysLMalt + warm water (mashing)LSweet, brown liquid (wort)LAdd adjuncts (cereal, potato, etc.)LFilterLAdd hopsLBoil (2+ hours)LCoolLCentrifugeLAdd cultured yeastLFerment(8-11 days for beer)(5-6 days for ale)LSkim to remove yeastLGreen beerLAdd yeast, sugar, or fresh wortLFermentLClarifyLBottle or canLPasteurize (keg)orUnpasteurized (draft beer)[After McGee, 1984]TYPES OF BEERMALTED BEERSAle has a higher hops concentration and a higheralcohol content (4-7%). It is brewed at a highertemperature and it is made by yeasts floating on thesurface of the wort, rather than those on the bottomof the tank.Bock is a potent dark beer. It is often made from thefirst hops and malt of the season.Porter is a dark, sweet, bock-like ale. It is usuallyaged for six to eight weeks. It is often made from aninferior malt and then colored with caramel or licorice.Stout is a porter-like beer of high alcohol content andwith a strong hop flavor. It is heavier than porterbeers and it is usually aged for about a year.Kvass or quass is a Russian beer made from barleyand rye and flavored with peppermint.Pombe or bousa is an African beer made from milletgrains.Weiss is a light, malty ale made mostly from wheat.UNMALTED BEERSChicha is a very popular South American beer that ispractically unknown in the U. S. It can be made froma variety of carbohydrate sources, including maize,potatoes, manioc, plantain, and palms. The enzymesneeded for fermentation to occur are provided byhuman saliva using the ancient \"chew and spit\"process.Ginger beer is produced by allowing a sugar solutioncontaining ginger rhizomes to be acted upon by yeastand bacteria.Hard cider is based upon the fact that many kinds offruits, especially the apple, ferment quickly. A largeproportion of the apple cider that we make is allowedto undergo acetic acid fermentation that will yieldcommercial vinegar.Mead is made with fermented honey. It is soconcentrated that fungi and bacteria cannot live easily-121-in it, which explains its long shelf life. It played animportant role in the 30 day wedding ceremonies, the\"honeymoon,\" of the Scandi-navians.Pulque is a favorite Mexican beer made from the sapof several different century plants (Agave spp.).Root beer is made from herbs, barks, roots, sugar,and yeast. Sarsaparilla, ginger, and wintergreen areoften used. There is, of course, the non-alcoholicversion sold by Hires, and others.Sake (also spelled saki) is a Chinese and Japanesefavorite made by fermenting steamed rice.Fermentation is accomplished by Aspergillus oryzae,rather than Saccharomyces. The alcohol content ishigher than that of typical wine or beer. Sake issometimes treated as a kind of wine.WINE\u201cWine is the most healthful and hygienic ofbeverages.\u201d [Louis Pasteur]' ' ' ' 'Wine-making is one of our most ancient enterprises.We read in Genesis that the first thing that Noah didafter the waters of the Great Flood had receded wasto plant a vineyard. We know, with perhaps morecertainty, that the ancient Mesopotamians made winethousands of years ago. The Greeks and Romans werewell-versed in the subject. Their wines were stored for15-25 years in a two-handled, earthenware vesselcalled an amphora. They also used amphorae to storeoils.By the Middle Ages, amphorae had been replaced bywooden casks. The habit at that time was not to fillthe casks completely. Contact with air in the barrelmade the wines turn to vinegar rather quickly, somost of these wines had to be drunk within a year orso. In 1690, Dom Pierre Perignon rediscovered the useof the cork and began storing champagne in newlydeveloped strong, glass bottles.The European colonists established vineyards aroundthe world. By the mid-1600's, the Spanish had plantedgrapes in Mexico, Chile, and Argentina. South Africahad vineyards a century later. California and Australiawere planted in the later part of the 18th century;New Zealand followed a few decades later.In 1863, the vineyards of the Rhone Valley in Francewere attacked by a root louse (Phylloxera vastatrix),imported accidently from the United States. Thisinsect caused the grape vines to loose their leaves andit eventually killed them. The European cultivars werehighly susceptible and the plague spread through thevineyards with appalling speed. Many treatments wereattempted, but the one that proved to be mostsuccessful involved grafting European cultivars ontoAmerican strains that were resistant to Phylloxera.The insect has never been eradicated from thevineyards. Almost all of today's wines are made fromgrafted vines.Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Chile, France,Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Soviet Union, Spain, andthe United States are the leading wine-producingcountries. France, Italy, and Spain are the top three,usually in that order.There are many species of grapes known throughoutthe world, but only one of them, the European Vitisvinifera meets all of the requirements for making anexcellent wine. Its fruit contains enough of the rightkinds of sugars with the properly low acidity so thatthe juices can be made into a stable and balancedwine without having to add large amounts of sugar orwater. We have domesticated thousands of cultivarsof this single species and they provide most of theworld's wine.DEFINITIONMany authorities restrict the term \"wine\" to fermentedgrape products. Other fruit sources, such as cherries,blackberries, and elderberries, often referred to aswines, are then considered to be hard ciders. Whilethe definition of \"wine\" may be a broad one in thestudy of economically important plants, it often is verynarrow in the legal sense. California restricts the termto only those products with a minimum percentage ofgrapes used in their manufacture.TYPES OF WINEThere are four commonly recognized categories ofwines. In dry wines, almost all of the sugar in thegrape has been fermented into ethanol and carbondioxide. The finished wine typically has an alcoholcontent of about 12%.In unfortified sweet wines, only a portion of thesugar is broken down. These are rich, sweet whitewines made from partly dehydrated grapes or fromthose that have been attacked by the \"noble rot,\"caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. In either case,the yeasts are killed by the level of alcohol produced(14%) before they can break down the highconcentrations of sugar present in the grapes.In sparkling wines, a second fermentation occursinside sealed containers. More sugar and yeasts areadded to the finished wine to set the stage. Becausethe second fermentation occurs inside sealed vessels,any carbon dioxide produced will remain in the wine,making it effervescent. The best known example of asparkling wine comes from the Champagne region ofFrance. In the strict sense, it must be made frompinot noir, pinot meunier, or Chardonnay grapes.Fortified wines have been augmented by wine-baseddistilled beverages to raise their alcohol content toabout 20%. They may be either sweet or dry. Thebest known examples are:' Madeira, named after an island off the coast ofPortugal; usually served after a meal or as adessert wine' Port is a fortified sweet, red wine named after thePortuguese city of Oporto. It is usually drunk afterdinner. There are also brown and white versionsavailable.' sherry, made from white palomino grapes andnamed after Jerez (Xeres)  de la Frontera, a townin southern Spain. Sherries range from very dry tovery sweet.Vermouth is a wine to which aromatic herbs havebeen added. The name comes from the German wordfor wormseed (wermut), one of the original flavorings.VARIETALS. I mentioned earlier that there werethousands of cultivars of Vitis vinifera. A few of them,called the \"noble grapes,\" produce the world's bestwines.-122-White Noble Grapes (White Wines):Chardonnay, makes champagne and our best whitewines in California, the Pacific Northwest, and NewYork;Chenin blanc, makes both dry and sweet wines;Gewurtztraminer, produces a highly scented wine;Riesling, also yields a highly scented grape thatproduces Germany's finest wines, and its best sweetwines when infected by the noble rot;Semillon, when infected with the noble rot, yieldssweet white wines of the Bordeaux region of France.Black Noble Grapes (Red Wines):Cabernet Sauvignon, yields wines that are high inacidity and tannins and that are long-lived;Gamay, from the Beaujolais district of Burgundy inFrance,  produces wines highly regarded for theirfresh, fruity flavors;Grenache, a black grape that does well in hotclimates of France, Spain, North Africa, and California;Merlot, from the Bordeaux region of France, producesa robust, long-lived wine;Pinot noir, yields fine red burgundies; andSyrah, which produces a robust red wine.Other grapes of note include: barbera, made from anItalian black grape; catawba, a black grape native toNorth America; colombard, a white grape used inCalifornia to make French colombard and, in France,to make some cognac; Concord, a black grape nativeto North America used to make both a dry wine and asweet kosher wine; lambrusco, an Italian blackgrape; mission, the first European grape introducedinto the New World and the main one used inCalifornia until the late-1800's; petite sirah, a blackgrape introduced into California from France;sylvaner, a white grape grown in Germany and inCalifornia; and zinfandel, a black grape, possiblyfrom Italy, now planted in California where it yieldsfruity, red wines.PROCESSINGWhile the process of wine-making is relatively easy toexplain, there is a great deal of art and sciencerequired to produce really top quality wines. Thejuices of the grape are squeezed out (expressed) bylarge machines (by foot in the olden days) to form themust. It is then inoculated with a particular strain ofyeast, Saccharomyces ellipsoideus. Fermentationbegins and it will continue until the alcohol contentreaches 10-14%, at which time the yeasts are killedby their own metabolic products. The must may betreated with sulfur dioxide or pasteurized to killunwanted micro-organisms that could spoil thedelicate flavor that is desired. Initial fermentationcontinues for several days, during which various solidssettle and chemical changes occur. The conversion ofgrape sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide alsogenerates heat. It and the alcohol itself begin to breakdown the grape skins. Tannins in the skin are of greatimportance in the production of many of the redwines. The stem of the grape is another source of thesetannins. Grapes may be fermented with the stemsintact, partially removed, or completely absent. Todaythere are machines that stem and crush the grapes,thereby allowing the skins and juices to be pumpedinto vats and the stems to be discarded. Vats aremade of wood, concrete, or stainless steel. If thegrape skins remain in the must, the result is a redwine. Many of them are named after the areas wherethey were first developed or they are associated withthe wine industry of a particular country. Somecommon examples of red wines are Burgandy, claret,Chianti, Cabernet, and zinfandel. If the skins are not allowed to remain on the grapesduring fermentation, a white wine will result. Whilethe skins may be left on long enough to impart somecolor and flavor, the juices will lack the tannin contentof red wines. These tannins inhibit the growth ofbacteria. Sulfur dioxide is used in its place. Whitewines are typically fermented at lower temperaturesthan are red wines. Common examples includeChardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Riesling, Tokay,Chablis, champagne, sauterne, and white burgundy.Ros\u00e9 wines are made by leaving the grape skins in themust for a short period of time and then removingthem. Really cheap ros\u00e9 wines may be mixtures of redand white wines.The high malic acid content of new wine can bereduced by a secondary fermentation or malolacticfermentation. The process is mediated by selectstrains of yeast. It is used extensively in theprocessing of California chardonnays. Better wines are then aged in wood for a period ofabout six months to several years. The casks aretypically made of oak and hold 225-228 liters (about60 gallons). Alcohol and water diffuse into the woodand then evaporate. These processes concentrate thewine at the same time that a number of highlycomplex biochemical changes are occurring. Duringmaturation, wine is decanted from one vessel toanother. Racking, as it is known in the trade, allowsa clear liquid to be drawn off and for the lees (deadyeasts, tartar crystals, small pieces of grape skin, andother solids) to remain behind. Wines may alsoundergo clarification or fining. This process alsoremoves microscopic solids. They coagulate aroundfining substances, such as egg white, gelatin, orbentonite, a kind of clay.WINE MAKINGHarvest grapesLCrushLRemove skins/seeds(white wine)LSqueeze our juices to form mustLAdd yeast, sugar, & sulfur dioxideLFermentLRemove skins/seeds(red wine)LDraw off liquid (rack)LClarify (fining)LAge in wooden barrelL-123-FilterLBottleLSell at an extravagant price FERMENTED BEVERAGESBeverage Plant Source Part UsedArrack (arak) Date (Phoenix dactylifera) FruitsBeer Many plant sources Grains, bractsChicha Various plants Grains, seedsCider Apple (Malus spp.) FruitsGinger beer Ginger (Zingiber spp.) RhizomesKava (yangona) Kava (Piper methysticum) Roots, etc.Kvass (quass) Cereals + mint (Mentha spp.) Grains, leavesPalm wine Various palms Stem apexPombe Millet (Eleusine spp.) GrainsPulque Maguey (Agave spp.) Stem apexRoot beer Several aromatic plants Leaves, bark, rootsSaki (sake) Rice (Oryza sativa) GrainsSorgo Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) GrainsWine Grapes (Vitis vinifera +  Vitis spp.) Fruits7.4 ! ALCOHOLICBEVERAGES (DISTILLED)\"There's no such thing as bad whiskey. Somewhiskeys just happen to be better than others.\"  [William Faulkner]'  ' ' ' 'We have not been satisfied with the modest 14%alcohol content afforded us by the natural processesof fermentation by microorganisms. We have evidencethat the ancient Egyptians and Greeks knew ofmethods to increase the alcohol content of a liquid.Aristotle wrote of making seawater drinkable by adistilling process and suggested that it could also beused with wines and beers.DISTILLATIONSometime during the late Middle Ages, the Arabs orthe Saracens perfected the process by which thepercentage of ethyl alcohol in a fermented drink couldbe increased by a process called distillation.The principle of distillation rests on a very simple fact.Alcohol vaporizes (changes from a liquid to a gas) at173E F and water vaporizes at 212E F. Therefore if youheat an alcohol + water mixture to just below theboiling point of water, the alcohol will turn to a gas,escape, leaving the water behind in its liquid state. Ifyou were to cook a beer mash or wine in an open pot,the alcohol would simply escape into the atmosphere.We do not want that to happen. We have to figure outa way to trap the alcohol and change it back frombeing a gas to a liquid.All of this is accomplished in a place called a distillery,in a device called a distilling apparatus or still. Theequipment consists of: (1) a boiler, the vessel orcontainer in which the material is heated; (2) acondenser that returns the gas to its liquid phase; and(3) a receiver in which the end product is collected.The boiler may be heated by coal, wood, or steam. Ontop of the boiler is a hood of some sort, a device fortrapping the alcohol vapors. The gas travels throughthin metal pipes, often made of copper, to acondensing coil. It is a section of metal tubing bathedin cold water. The temperature of the alcohol vapordrops below 173E F and it changes back to its liquidstate. The alcohol now trickles out of the condenserinto a receiving pan or vessel of some sort. There areseveral different kinds of stills. Some of them have thegrace and elegance of a large, ugly hot water tank,while others are extremely handsome pieces ofequipment.TYPES OF DISTILLED BEVERAGESWhiskey (also spelled whisky) comes from twoScottish and Irish words meaning the \"water of life.\"It is a very popular drink made from cereal grains,although potatoes are sometimes used. Whiskey isusually aged in white oak casks. This aging may lastfor several years. The alcohol content is about 50%(or 100 proof, another way of describing alcoholcontent). Several different kinds of whiskey are incommon use. Bourbon or corn whiskey is madefrom at least 51% corn mash. It was first concocted inBourbon Co., Kentucky by the Rev. Elijah Craig, aBaptist minister. Irish whiskey is made from abarley mash. The malt is kiln-dried. Rye or ryewhiskey is made from at least 51% rye mash.Scotch or Scotch whiskey is made from barleymash that is cured in the smoke of a peat fire. -124-Gin is distilled to obtain nearly pure alcohol. The mashis usually of maize and rye. Various aromatics, such asthe juniper berry (Juniperus spp.) or sloe berry(Prunus spinosa) are added for flavor.Vodka is from the Russian word for water. For allpractical purposes, it is pure ethanol. It is made froma wheat-malt mash and it is unflavored and unaged.Rum (rhum or ron) is distilled from sugar-cane juiceor from molasses to which water and yeast are added.It is then distilled to yield an alcohol content of about80-150 proof. It is aged in oak, usually for 1 to 10years. Various flavorings are often added. Most of ourrum comes from the Caribbean. Tequila, a favorite Mexican drink, is made by distillingthe fermented juice from a century plant (Agavespp.). The highest quality is obtained by using 100%blue agave, a cultivar of A. tequileana. Plants that areabout 10-12 years old are harvested. After the leaveshave been cut off, what remains is a 75-150 lb. plantpart that the locals call a \"pi\u00f1a\" or \"cabeza.\" It issometimes called the fruit of the plant, but that isincorrect. The agave heads are cooked in ovens,cooled, and then put through mechanical crushers thatseparate the juice from the solid material. Yeasts areadded to the agave juice to begin the fermentationprocess. The fermented mash will then be distilled.Tequila is a very popular drink these days. Premiumlabels sell for as much as $300 a bottle; $20 a shot atyour fancy upscale bars down in The City. Brandy is made by distilling wine or fermented fruitsother than grapes. It is usually aged in wood. Thealcohol content is about 40-50%. Cognac, named afterthe French city, is probably the best known brandy.Absinthe is the most dangerous and notorious of thedistilled beverages. It is a green liqueur made of oil ofwormwood (from a kind of sagebrush, Artemisiaabsinthium), fennel, star-anise, and other aromatics.Sale of absinthe was banned in France in 1915, withthe United States and many other countries adoptingsimilar restrictions. Curiously, in 2005 Switzerland willonce again allow limited production.The toxic principles appear to be l-thujone and d-isothujone. On the other hand, a mixture of absintheand anisette is reported to be excellent in treatingmotion sickness. A reformulated version of absinthe,called pernod, appeared in 1922. It lacks thewormwood, but retains the anise base.Over indulgence causes:' mania;' convulsions;' irritation of the gastrointestinal tract;' stupor;' hallucinations;' extreme nervousness;' loss of hearing and sight;' coma; and ' death.Akvavit is a favorite Scandinavian drink made fromgrains or potatoes flavored with caraway seeds.Bitters is made from various herbs and flavorings.The alcohol content is about 40%. Angostura bitterscontains quinine and several aromatic substances,including the angostura bark from Galipea, a memberof the citrus family.Liqueurs or cordials are made by combining brandywith a series of flavorings, often by simply addingdried fruits. Common examples include apricotcordials, creme de cacao, and creme de menthe.DISTILLED BEVERAGESProduct Plant Source Commentabsinthe grape, wormwood spirit flavored with oil of wormwoodakvavit (aquavit) potato and caraway distilled potato starch and caraway fruitsarrack rice, sugar cane, palm distillate of fermented grains and palm juicebrandy grapes distilled grape winecognac grapes distilled grape winefruit brandy apples, plums, etc. distilled fruit winesgin maize, rye, juniper grains malted, fermented, and distilledguaro sugar cane The national drink of Costa Ricaliqueurs grape and sugarcane spirits, sweetened and flavored with herbsmezcal century plant distillate of fermented sap and pulpokolehao (oke) rice, dasheen molasses-flavored; aged in charred barrels; Hawai\u2019iraki (ouzo) various plants distillate of wine, grain, potatoes or molassesrum sugar cane juice fermented and distilledtequila century plant distillate of fermented sap and pulpvermouth grape and wormwood fortified wine flavored with herbsvodka rye, potato, wheat distilled potato or grain starchwhiskey barley, maize, and rye grains malted, fermented, and distilled-125-8.0 \u2022 INDUSTRIALLY IMPORTANT PLANTS8.1 ! AN OVERVIEW' Many of our great industries are based upon theextraction and processing of various woods,fibers, fixed oils, essential oils, latexes, gums,resins, starches, dyes, etc. from plants.' Still others are involved with a host of productsderived from micro-organisms, such as carefullymaintained cultures of yeasts needed for breadmaking and brewing, and other fungi that areused in medicine.' In some instances, a plant is killed duringprocessing to extract a particular product.' In other cases we have developed refinedtechniques that allow us to remove what wewant, but to keep the plant alive.' The importance of some plants, such as Par\u00e1rubber, was linked to technologicaldevelopments; in this case the invention of thepneumatic tire and the internal combustionengine. Before that, it was an interestingcuriosity with limited potential.' As the natural sources have been exploited anddepleted, we find it increasingly necessary tocreate synthetic substitutes for these extractives.8.2 ! FIBER  PLANTS\u201cFiber plants are second only to food plants in termsof their usefulness to humans and their influence onthe advancement of civilization. Tropical people useplant fibers for housing, clothing, hammocks, nets,baskets, fishing lines and bowstrings. Even in ourindustralized society, we use a variety of natural plantfibers.... In fact the so-called synthetic fibers nowproviding much of our clothing are only reconstitutedcellulose of plant origin.\u201d [Mark Plotkin, 1988]' ' ' ' 'The category \"fiber plants\" is an artificial one,including not only true fibers based on anatomicalorigin, but also a number of miscellaneous plants andplant parts that are loosely called fibers. Woody planttissues also contain fibers, but they are treated in thenext section.GENERAL FEATURES OF FIBER CELLS' Long and slender, with tapering ends; ' About 1-250 mm long and about 1/100 to 6/100mm wide;' Dead at maturity;' Comparatively thick walls;' Central opening (lumen) is typically quite small;' Occur in clusters.The cell wall of a fiber consists of cellulose,hemicellulose, and lignins. Often, especially in thecase of high quality fibers, the cell wall is almost purecellulose.TYPES OF FIBERSSoft, stem, or bast fibers occur toward the outside ofthe stem, when viewed in cross-section. For those ofyou with a general botany background, bast fiberstypically lie in the cortex, phloem, and pericycletissues. Common examples include flax, hemp, ramie,and jute.Hard, leaf, or structural fibers usually come fromleaves, typically from some kind of monocot, such asthose in the century plant family. The leaves are oftentough, with the fibers embedded in a pulpy matrix.Common examples include sisal, Manila-hemp, andNew Zealand flax.Surface fibers are derived from surfaces of seedsand interior walls of fruits. The most important ofthem are fibers derived from the seeds, with cottonbeing the pre-eminent example. In addition to cotton,kapok, cotton-grass, and several species of milkweedsyield surface fibers.PROCESSINGStem or bast fibers usually occur in bundles,cemented together by a middle lamella. The fibers arefreed from one another by a process called retting. Itinvolves their partial decomposition in water by micro-organisms. The water may be dew or rain, or thefibers may be submerged in lakes, rivers, or tanks.After retting, the fibers may be scutched, a processof smashing the stems between fluted rollers. Thecentral core and bark of the stem are separated fromone another.Leaves are scraped and pounded to separate thevascular bundles from a pulpy matrix around them.Traditionally this was done by hand, but now amachine called a decorticator is used. Because somuch manual labor is involved, hard fibers are oftengrown and processed in tropical countries whereinexpensive labor is available.The processing of seed fibers involves ginning, inwhich the fibers are caught on toothed disks or combsand are then pulled through openings too small for theseed itself to pass.Once fibers have been extracted they may be putthrough additional machines to align them with oneanother (combed), stretched (attenuated), and thentwisted to interlock them to yield yarn. It is thentwisted in the opposite direction to produce cord,which is used to make rope, which is used to makecables.-126-HOW DO WE USE FIBERS?Fibers may also be classified according to their uses:textile fibers are used primarily in the fabricindustry. Cotton, flax, ramie, hemp, and jute arecommon examples.cordage fibers are used to make twines and ropes.Jute, cotton, hemp, abac\u00e1, sisal, and New Zealand flaxare common examples.brush, plaiting or braiding fibers are used to make brooms, brushes, mats, hats, baskets, rugs, screens,etc.  In this category, the fiber strand can be braidedor folded. Examples include a variety of palms,bamboos, herbaceous grasses, and sedges.filling fibers are used for stuffing, caulking, andreinforcing. Kapok, cotton, several of the hard fibers,Spanish moss, and many grasses fall into thiscategory.paper-making fibers are used to make paper. Whowould have guessed it? There are purists, however,who will argue that hemp, paper mulberry, papyrus,kenaf, rice paper, and various bamboos do not give us\u201cpaper,\u201d but only a writing surface. Real paper, theysay, can be made only out of wood fibers and ragsthat have been reduced to a pulp and thenreconstituted. See Section 8.3 for a discussion ofpaper-making.FLAXFlax is one of the oldest fibers. It comes from Linumusitatissimum, a member of the flax family (Linaceae).From the time of the ancient Egyptians until about the19th century, it was the leading fiber plant. Now it isrelatively unimportant. Flax seeds are the source oflinseed oil.Flax is retted, either in dew or it is immersed in waterfor one or two weeks. After retting, the fibers arescutched. The central core and bark are separatedfrom one another. Commercial flax is derived from thebark. The fiber is superior to cotton in many ways.Flax fibers can absorb up to 20% of their own weightin water and they are stronger wet than they are dry.For this reason, hey are prized as towels.HEMP\u201cHemp is intertwined with American history. We grewit to rig the great New England sailing ships, traveledwest in Conestoga wagons covered in hemp cloth,dressed in homespun hemp cloth when we got thereand wound up wearing hemp jeans. We tied our cargowith hemp rope and fed the poultry with hemp seed.We used hemp to help develop this country.... GeorgeWashington said, \u2018Make the most of hemp seed. Sowit everywhere.\u201d (Willie Nelson) ' ' ' ' 'Like flax, hemp (or hempen) fiber is another plantwith a long history of use. Its fiber is similar to that offlax and it may be used as a substitute for it. Hemp(Cannabis sativa) is native to Asia. The plant is notonly the source of a valuable fiber, but it also yieldsedible seeds (used for birdseed), oils, andpsychoactive resins. The stems are allowed to ret for3-8 weeks, usually in the dew of fields. They are thenscutched. Hemp is used in cordage, in rather coarsefabrics, and to caulk wooden sailing ships, a need thatseems to be declining. Until the latter part of the 19thcentury, hemp was a major source of fiber formanufacturing paper. Its present day advocates havelaunched an educational campaign to grow it onceagain for that purpose, thereby saving our forests.A COMPARISON OF HEMP & PINE PAPER PULPHemp Pine trees80% conversion to pulp 43 % conversion3-20% lignin 30% ligninRequires less bleaching Requires more3-8 tons dry wt. per acre 2-4 tonsTIMELINE: HEMP FIBERBCE:8000 Earliest fiber remains at \u00c7atal H\u00fcy\u00fck4500 Spreads from Central Asia to China2800 Emperor Shen Nung teaches Chinese tocultivate2700 Use widespread in Old World170 Oldest extant specimens of hemp paper CE:100 Chinese first to make paper from hemp1150 Moors open factory in Spain (first inEurope)1533 Henry VIII requires farmers to grow hemp1545 Spanish introduce hemp to New World1563 Elizabeth I renews Henry\u2019s decree1564 Philip I of Spain orders use in Central &South America1611 King James Bible printed on hemp1619 Jamestown colonists directed to growhemp1637 Families in Hartford, CT ordered to plant 1tsp. of seed1645 Puritans introduce into New England1753 Linnaeus publishes Cannabis sativa asscientific name1776 Drafts of Declaration of Independencewritten on hemp1807 Treaty of Tilset controls sale of hemp1812 U.

See the \u201cSurvey of Fiber Plants\u201d tablefor more details.PAPYRUS\u201cPapyrus sheets preserve the thoughts and deeds ofman.\u201d (Leonardo Da Vinci)This writing material of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks,and Romans was prepared from the stems of anaquatic sedge, Cyperus papyrus. The plant is native tocentral Africa and the Nile Valley. It is naturalized insouthern Europe. The plant is a typical member of thefamily, in that its stems are solid, rather than hollow,as in the grasses. The Egyptians perfected thetechnique of cutting strips of tissue, placing themparallel to one another, smashing them together witha smooth rock and water from the Nile, and thendrying them to form papyrus. The process wasrecorded by the Greek historian Herodotus, in the 5thcentury B. C. E.Although our modern word \u201cpaper\u201d comes frompapyrus, purists on the subject do not refer topapyrus as paper. They restrict the term to writingsurface prepared from cloth or wood that has beenpulped, which means that the fiber tissues have beensmashed and macerated (soaked in water to softenthem), and then trapped on a screen to form flatsheets of writing material.Papyri have amazing durability. Scholars have accessto texts from the early dynasties that tell us of ancientwars, political matters, day-to-day life, and that alsodocument their uses of plants. It is customary to givethem names. The Ebers Papyrus, discovered inThebes, Egypt in 1872, lists several hundred medicinalplants, along with how they were prepared and used. Papyrus fibers were used to make sails, clothing,mats, and cords. In about the 9th century, it wasreplaced by paper as a principal writing material.COTTON\u201cI wish I was in de land ob cotton, old times dar amnot forgotten. Look away, look away, look away, DixieLand.\u201d (Daniel Decatur Emmett, 1859)' ' ' ' 'King Cotton! This is the world's most important fiberplant. In addition, its seeds yield cottonseed oil andthey are used for fodder cake. The mature fruit, theboll, splits open to reveal the fibers, outgrowths ofthe seed surface. These unicellular hairs areessentially pure cellulose. The hairs may be 1000-6000 times longer than they are wide. They occur intwo forms: (1) fuzz, also called linters, that are thickat the base and firmly attached to the seed itself; and(2) lint, with a narrow, delicate base that is easilydetached. Lint can be spun. The linters are removedby special machinery and they are used to make nitro-cellulose and rayon. What do we use nitrocellulosefor? (A hint: it is the N in TNT.)There are three major groups of cotton species, basedon the length of the seed fibers:' Long-staple (2.5-6.5 cm long) cottons are themost difficult to grow, but they yield a fine,lustrous fiber. Examples include sea island, pima,and Egyptian cottons.' Medium-staple (1.3-3.3 cm long). American up-land cotton is an example.' Short-staple (1.0-2.5 cm long) yield coarserfibers that end up in blankets and carpets, orblended with better quality material.PROCESSING. The processing of cotton fibersinvolves several stages, including:' ginning, the removal of the lint fibers from theseeds; ' carding, the straightening of fibers;' combing, which brings the fibers in parallel,equal-sized groups; and' spinning, which is the twisting of fibers into acontinuous thread.SPECIES OF COTTON. Cottons are derived fromvarious species of Gossypium, plants related to okraand the ornamental hibiscus. The genus is representedin both the Old World and in the New World. Theleading Asiatic species are Gossypium arboreum andG. herbaceum. The Old World cottons have 13 pairs oflarge chromosomes. Gossypium barbadense and G.hirsutum, the leading New World cottons, have 26pairs of chromosomes -- 13 pairs of largechromosomes and 13 pairs of small ones.GENETICS OF COTTON. There is some controversyas to the number of species of cotton. About 30 ofthem are diploids (2n = 2x = 26) and four aretetraploids (2n = 4x = 52). Only four of them are ofsignificant economic importance. Gossypium hirsutum(cotton, upland cotton) provides about 95% of ourcotton fibers; G. barbadense (sea island cotton, pima,Egyptian cotton) most of the remaining 5%.AN OVERVIEW OF COTTON SPECIESThey fall into four groups that are recognized at thesubgeneric level:' Australian (C-genome diploids)' New World (D-genome diploids)' African & Arabian (A, B, E, & F genomes)' New World (AD tetraploids)Here is an overview expressed in a little more detail.-128-Genome(s) DistributionDiploids:AA 1 (G. herbaceum); S.

America; Pacific)AADD G. caicoense (Brazil)AADD G. tomentosum (Hawai\u2019i)Have you noticed that we have a little problem withour New World cottons? There are several with the Dgenome native here. We also have three tetra-ploidcottons with both the D and A genomes. But there areno native New World cottons that could havecontributed the A genome! How an Old World seedsource got to the New World remains an openquestion. Recent molecular studies suggest that theevent occurred only once, about 1-2 million years ago.Most of the cotton in the United States is grownexactly where you suspect, in the southern states.Repeated plantings have depleted the soils, forcingthe farmer to rotate crops in order to replenish them.Until the development of appropriate insecticides, theboll weevil (Anthonomus grandis), introduced fromMexico just prior to the turn of the 20th century, wasa major cotton pest. It is a beetle that lays its eggs inthe fruit, where its larvae hatch and damage theplant. The fruit of cotton and flax is called a boll. Ithink that I was in college before I realized that thebug was not called a \u201cbo weevil.\u201dFor centuries, the growing of cotton was intimatelytied to the institution of slavery. The following datafrom Mississippi and Louisiana are instructive.COTTON AND SLAVESYear Pounds Exported # of Slaves1785 5,000 8,0001790 25,000 8,2001800 20,000,000 10,0001820 125,000,000 32,0001858 1,100,000,000 450,000[Source: Kahn, 1985]THE AGAVE FIBERSThese fibers are derived from plants of the agave orcentury plant family (Agavaceae).  Most are sterilepolyploids. They are called century plants based onthe mistaken belief that they bloomed every 100years. The agaves yield about 90% of all of the hardfibers used in commerce. About half is derived fromsisal, named after a port city in Mexico. After 3-8years, depending on the species, the plants will haveproduced about 300 thick, juicy, sword-shaped leavesthat are ready to be harvested by machetes or similarimplements.Leaves are inserted into mechanical decorticatorsthat separate the fiber bundles from the softer, pulpyleaf tissues. A decorticator consists of a set of rotatingwheels armed with blunt knives. The fibers aretypically washed, dried on racks in the sun or by hotair, and cleaned. The various agave fibers are used tomake strong, inexpensive ropes and twines. They arealso used in paper, matting, and building panelmaterials. The waste pulp is used as a fertilizer. The sap of other Agave species is fermented to yieldmaguey or mezcal, or distilled to produce tequila.

It is native to thePhilippines. Historically the fibers were highly prizedbecause they do not deteriorate in salt water. Thismeant that they were commonly used in marineropes, ship caulking, and sails. They were also used tomake sacks, coarse fabrics, and wrapping paper.While you may not have heard of Manila hemp, it isprobably more commonly encountered in your dailylife than you realize. It is found in tea bags, cigarettefilters, salami wrappers, and in manila folders andenvelopes (hence the name). In Japan, the fibers areused in the light-weight interior walls of homes.The fibers are extracted from the sheaths at the baseof the banana-like leaves. They are strong, light, andcan be 2-4 meters long! They are the strongest of thestructural fibers.MINOR FIBER PLANTSBARK CLOTH. Early European explorers of the SouthPacific found the natives wearing various article ofclothing that they made from bark fibers. The bestknown of these is tapa or kapa, which is a Polynesianword meaning \u201cthe beaten thing.\u201d Tapa can be madefrom several plants, including the paper mulberry,breadfruit, milo, and hau tree.-129-PAPER MULBERRY (Broussonetia papyrifera), yieldsthe best known of the bark cloths. It is a tree nativeto southeast Asia. The Polynesians carried the plantwith them as they colonized the South Pacific. Theinner bark of the plants is used, after the outer layerhas been scrapped away. While the fibers are stilldamp, they are spread evenly into strips. Now theyare placed on a smooth surface and beaten with awooden mallet (hence the name, \u201cbeaten thing\u201d). Thefibers spread out and mat with one another. Mucilagefrom plants such as the taro and hibiscus is used toincrease adherence of fibers. Sections of tapa areattached to one another by pounding togetheroverlapping edges. In this way, it is possible to  createwrap-around garments, mats, and panels ofconsiderable size, and writing materials. Tapa cloth isoften elaborately dyed -- brown, red (from annatto),yellow (from turmeric), and black (from the kukui orcandlenut tree). The patterns are characteristic of thevarious islanders who made them and have assistedanthropologists in determining the sequence ofinhabiting the islands of the South Pacific.KAPOK. The kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra), native tothe American tropics, is the source of valuable stuffingor filling fibers used in life preservers, cushions,mattresses, sleeping bags, and as an insulatingmaterial. The fibers line the interior fruit wall andsurround the seeds. Relatives of the kapok tree whosefibers are used in a similar fashion include the silk-floss tree and the red silk-cotton tree.RAMIE. Ramie or China-grass (Boehmeria nivea) isnative to the Old World, probably to China. The fiberis one of the finest known, but problems in getting itout of the stem and degumming the fibers have madeit difficult to process economically. Ramie has about8X the tensile strength of cotton and 4X that of flax.When you look at our specimen in the subtropicaldome, it may remind you of a large nettle. They are inthe same plant family. Ramie does not sting, however.Most members of the nettle family (Urticaceae) donot.JUTE. Corchorus capsularis and C. olitorius, relativesof our popular  basswood tree, come from easternAsia.  The latter has become a widespread tropicalweed. About 98% of the world\u2019s production comesfrom Asia. Jute is a very widely used fiber, although itis of poor quality. Much of it will be used for packingmaterial and spun into a coarse yarn. About three-quarters of the crop will be used to make sacks.Although you may not have heard of jute fibers, youknow of two products that are made from them --burlap bags and gunny sacks. By the way, what is agunny? How many will fit in a sack? Also, look on theunderside of carpets and linoleum. You may well findjute fibers in the backing.KENAF. Hibiscus cannabinus is a related to theornamental hibiscus, cotton, and okra. Plants weredomesticated first in Africa, probably before 4000B.C.E. Through the millennia, kenaf has been used inthe Old World as a substitute for jute. Shortly afterWorld War II, production increased dramatically.India, China, and Thailand are the main producerstoday.Kenaf is an easily grown, annual crop. One acre ofkenaf can yield 7-10 tons of dry fibers -- five timeswhat an acre of pine trees would produce. The fibersare increasingly popular for paper pulp. The newsprintmade from kenaf is brighter, requires less ink, and theink sticks to the paper better. This is a minor blessingto those of us addicted to the Los Angeles and NewYork Times.A SURVEY OF FIBER PLANTSCommon Name (Scientific Name) Family Commentsabac\u00e1 (Musa textilis) Banana Banana relative; cordage, baggingAfrican-hemp (Urena lobata) Mallow Used for fishing nets and cordagearamina (Urena lobata) Mallow New World; jute-like fiberbasswood (Tilia americana) Basswood Used by Native Americans; basketsbolo-bolo (Clappertonia ficifolia) Basswood Africa; used for matsbowstring-hemp (Sansevieria senegambica) Century Plant Africa; nets and bowstringsbroomroot (Muhlenbergia macroura) Grass North & Central America; brushescabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto) Palm Found from Florida to N.

WOOD, ITSBYPRODUCTS, & CORKANATOMICAL STRUCTUREWhen we first attempt to describe or identify a plant,we often note whether it is an herb, a shrub, or a tree.This classification has served us well since prehistorictimes. While useful, it is misleading in the sense thatherbs, shrubs, and trees are structurally quite similarto one another. They are composed of the same planttissues. Beginning at the outside and working our wayto the center they are the epidermis, cortex, pericycle,phloem, cambium, xylem, and pith. The differencebetween an herbaceous and a woody plant is notwhether one or more of these tissues is present orabsent, but the degree to which particular tissuescontinue to be produced year after year. In a woodyplant, the incremental growth of the outer four tissues(epidermis, cortex, pericyle, and phloem) constitutethe bark, a tough, protective outer layer. Herbs mayhave a light covering of bark on their stems andbranches, but not to the degree that we encounter inshrubs and trees. These tissues are, for the most part,dead at maturity. Beneath the bark lies the cambium, a living tissue thatcontinues to undergo repeated cell divisions during thelife of the plant. It will produce some additionalphloem tissue to the outside and significant additionalxylem tissue toward the inside. Plant anatomists referto these as the secondary phloem and secondaryxylem, respectively. Xylem and phloem are theplumbing system of a plant. They are the tissuesthrough which water and nutrients flow. Most of thesetissues will also be dead at maturity. The chiefdifference between an herbaceous plant and a woodyone is that the latter continue to build layer upon layerof secondary xylem in annual increments (annualrings). In other words, most of what we call wood issecondary xylem. Also note that when you look at aperfectly healthy, mature tree most of its stem system(the trunk and branches) are composed of dead cells.In fact, xylem tissue will not be fully functional as thewater plumbing system of the stem until it is dead andits cell contents (cytoplasm) have dissolved. Theportion of the xylem tissue that conducts water iscalled sapwood; the portion that is no longerfunctional is the heartwood.Forestry and lumber industry people recognize twomajor categories of woody plants -- hardwoods andsoftwoods. The terms are confusing, because theysuggest some feature of the wood itself; somemeasure of its density or hardness. Instead, they tellus whether the wood comes from a conifer (softwood)or from a flowering plant (hardwood). While it is truethat there are fundamental anatomical differencesbetween the xylem tissues of most conifers and mostflowering plants, they do not lead to a soft wood inone group and a hard wood in the other.CHEMICAL STRUCTUREFrom a chemical viewpoint, wood is primarilycellulose and lignins. Cellulose is a carbohydratepolymer -- a long molecule made of many glucoseresides (C6H10O5) linked to one another. You know ofglucose, a monosaccharide sugar (C6H12O6). Theorganization of these glucose residues becomes quitecomplex. The structure of glucose remains an activesubject of research. Cellulose is found in other partsof the plant, as well. Grass leaves are high incellulose. One of the reasons that we havedomesticated certain animals is that their digestivesystems are able to deal with these molecules,because ours lack the enzymes needed to break downcellulose. Lignin is the other main constituent of wood.A typical wood sample will contain about half as muchlignin as cellulose. It is also a high polymer ofrepeating phenylpropanoid molecules. I do not havethe slightest idea what phenylpropanoid moleculesare. Lignin breaks down even less easily thancellulose. By the way, much of the foul smellassociated with paper pulping mills comes from thelignin residue that is a byproduct of paper making.CHARACTERISTICS OF WOODColor. Woods come in a variety of colors, includingyellow, black, red, white, green, purple, and variousstriped combinations. These result from pigments inthe xylem.Porosity refers to the number, size, and distributionof larger cells (vessels) in the wood. It will determinehow readily a kind of wood takes paint or is resistantto decay. Some trees, such as maple and basswood,have their vessels scattered through the wood(diffuse-porous). Other woods, such as those fromoaks, walnuts, elms, and ashes have vessels that areparallel to the annual rings (ring-porous).Grain is the technical term for the alignment of cellsthat make up the xylem tissue. All of them can beparallel to the vertical axis of the tree, such that across-section cuts neatly through all of them. Some liethat angles so that an oblique cut is produced. Othersare arranged spirally. Grain is a major feature indetermining the aesthetic appeal of a particular wood.Density of a wood is its weight divided by its volume.-132-The industry standard calls for measuring an oven-dried cube of wood 1 cm on each side. Because 1 cm3of water weighs 1 gram, any wood that has a densityof less than 1.0 will float in water; those with adensity of greater than 1.0 will sink. Balsa wood isprobably the lightest, with a density of 0.13grams/cm3. You have probably seen balsa woodwithout knowing it. Think about the thin, light woodused to make model airplanes. At the other end of thescale are lignum vitae and quebracho with densities ofabout 1.25 grams/cm3. Densities for woods fromvarious North American trees include: incense cedar,0.35; Douglas-fir, 0.45; redwood, 0.41; ponderosapine, 0.38; white ash, 0.55; black cherry, 0.47;American elm, 0.46; white oak, 0.60; sycamore, 0.46;and black walnut, 0.51.Durability. Woods vary greatly in the kinds ofchemicals, such as phenolic and terpenoidcompounds, that they deposit in their heartwood. Thisdetermines the durability of the wood. In some trees,such as redwood and bald-cypress, the deposition ofvarious compounds retards the growth of fungi andbacteria that would otherwise decompose the woodover a period of time. On the other hand, basswoodand poplar (usually misspelled and mispronounced\"popular\") decay comparatively rapidly. Because mostwoods will last much longer if they are kept dry, wehave developed a series of preservatives, such aspaints, varnishes, creosotes, and tar oils that we applyto their surfaces.Moisture content. The amount of moisture in woodranges from about 70% to 7%, with the sapwoodhaving a higher water content than the heartwood. Inmost instances, woods with a lower water content arepreferable to those with more moisture.Mechanical Properties. Cleavability is an index ofhow easily wood can be split. When we want to chopfirewood, we want a wood that cleaves easily. Whenwe are constructing something that requires us to usenails or screws in the wood, we want low cleavability.In addition, there are a number of mechanicalproperties of wood that must be taken into account.They include stiffness, tensile strength, shearstrength, crushing strength, and cross-breakingstrength. The particular use intended for the wood willdetermine which of these features is critical.THE USES OF WOODFUEL. Until the development of alternate energysources, such as coal, oil, gasoline, electricity, andnuclear materials, we burned wood. Even today, about1 billion m3 of wood is consumed by burning it as fuel.In North America, only about 10% of our annualtimber harvest goes for fuel, but in Latin Americanand Africa that figure is much closer to 90%. In thiscountry, wood is a primary fuel in some of the morerural areas. Woods vary considerably in the way thatthey burn. This is a function of their physical andchemical structure. Obviously the density and drynessof the wood are important factors. Most woods willyield about 4 calories of heat for each gram burned.When we burn a piece of wood, the first phaseinvolves evaporation of water. This requires heat.Then comes the vaporization of volatile materials inthe wood at we observe as the flame of the fire. Manyconifers are a problem in this regard because theirwood is impregnated with resins that will formflammable deposits on the interior of stove pipes andchimneys. Once enough heat has been reached, thecell walls of the xylem itself begin to burn or glow.This is the stage of maximum heat production.For most of us, burning wood is not a necessity, butan option that we enjoy. We buy cords of wood for ourfireplaces or we burn charcoal in our cookouts. A cordof wood is a stack 8' wide, 4' high, and 4' deep. A facecord has the same width and height, but the individuallogs may be only 16\" or 24\" long, as opposed to 48\"in the full cord. Charcoal is wood that has been burnedin a contained area where only enough oxygen occursfor partial combustion, as in an underground pit. Inother words, it has gone through the first and secondstages of burning that I described in the lastparagraph. Charcoal can produce very hightemperatures, hot enough to smelt some metals. Inthis country we see charcoal in the form of briquets.They are molded from wood waste and often containcoal. Before you get too upset about learning that youwere cooking with coal at your last picnic, have youever considered that coal is, for the most part, wood?Yes, very, very old wood. Fossil wood.LUMBER. About 0.5 billion m3 of timber are harvestedeach year as sawlogs for the production of lumber forthe construction. The United States and Canada arethe leading consumers of timber for this purpose, withEurope close behind. In the U. S., we harvest about38 billion board feet or almost 0.25 billion m3 eachyear for lumber. There is little of this activity in Asia,Africa, and Latin America. Logging and millingoperations are often geographically close to oneanother because 50-70% of the cost of producinglumber is in getting the logs to the mill. In a highlyefficient, modern mill about 60-70% of the log willeventually become lumber. The rest is shavings,sawdust, trimmings, etc. In the United States, most ofour timber comes from forests in the West and in theSoutheast. Lumber production is about 40 billionboard feet per year, with about 75% of it beingderived from softwoods. The demand of lumber forthe housing industry is a major use. A typical framehouse contains about 10,000 board feet. Each yearabout 3 billion board feet of lumber go into themanufacture of furniture, handles, baseball bats,musical instruments, caskets, and an almost endlesslist of other items. Here both utility and beauty of thewood are critical factors.A particular piece may be may of solid wood or aveneer, a thin (0.25 mm to 1 cm thick) sheet of woodof uniform thickness that is either shaved (slicedveneer) from a flat surface of a log or more commonlypeeled from it as the log is revolving (rotary-cut). Thetechniques may suggest to you that advancedtechnology is needed to produce veneers, but this isnot the case. We find them in the tombs of thePharaohs who lived 3500 B. P. How they did it issomething of a mystery. Yet another example, somewould say, of extraterrestrial intervention. Becausethey can be laminated onto the surface of a cheaperwood or composite material, veneers are very popular.When considering the purchase of some piece offurniture, most of us would select something madefrom solid wood, as opposed to a veneer. Obviously,solid wood is better than an item where only thesurface is the real thing. Perhaps not! An expertveneer cutter can produce an exterior beauty that thevast majority of solid woods cannot match. Furnituremade of a solid wood is also more likely to warp,crack, and split. Of course, if the wood is to be carved,then solid wood is the choice.The most utilitarian use of veneer is in themanufacture of plywood. Douglas-fir is the principalsource of plywood veneer in this country. To make-133-plywood, an odd number of sheets of veneer are gluedto one another, each so that the grains run at rightangles to the sheet immediately above and below it.Recent development of synthetic resins havepermitted very effective gluing of the plies to oneanother. The chances of failure and peeling are muchreduced. Pound for pound, modern plywood arestronger than steel.OTHER USES OF RAW WOOD. Some logs arestripped of their bark, allowed to dry, often afterhaving been impregnated with chemicals. Thisunmilled material is called round wood. It finds its wayinto a variety of products, including poles, posts,pilings, and timbers for mines. Over 6 million newpoles for telephone and telegraph wires are producedeach year; about 300 million new posts annually. Wealso cut these logs into shingles and shakes. If oneend is thicker than the other, it is a shingle.I have no idea how many railroad ties there are in thiscountry. Because we have been unable to come upwith anything better, we still use about 1 billion boardfeet per year to replace worn out ties. That translatesinto about 30 million per year.Most of the need in this country for wooden barrelshas disappeared because of metal, plastic, and papersubstitutes. But, barrel-making, technically known ascooperage, remains as a minor industry. If you needa watertight container, you want a tight cooperagebarrel; otherwise a slack cooperage one will do. Thebest wood for tight cooperage is white oak becausethe xylem cells of its wood are clogged up so badlythat water will not pass through them. The wood alsohas no undesirable smell or taste to it. The vastmajority of the white oak goes for whiskey barrels andto age red wine. Some large redwood tanks have beenin use in California wineries for almost a century.LUMBER BYPRODUCTS. Pieces of wood that are toosmall, poorly shaped, or simply ugly have their uses,as well. They are made into particle board, fiberboard,and chipboard. The first two require that these piecesof wood be reduced to smaller chips, sorted, andgraded. The particles are then mixed with glues,pesticides, fire retardants, etc. and then pressed intothe required size and shape. Fiberboard, as the namesuggests, are made from wood fibers, not from smallwood chips. Pieces of wood are placed in chemicalsolvents to separate the fibers, resins, and otheradditives are mixed with them, and the resultingproduct then pressed into sheets and dried.Masonite is manufactured by subjecting wood chips tohigh pressure in a steam chamber and then explodingthem by a quick release of the pressure. This changetears the fibers apart and it reactivates the lignin,which will act as a glue to fix and bind the wood fibersin their new orientation. Further application of heatand pressure will produce a grainless, synthetic boardthat is hard and water resistant.Rayon, cellophane, and acetate are also woodbyproducts, in that they come from wood cellulose.The first two differ only in their final form -- a sheet ora thread. Wood chips are placed in a chemical baththat reduces them to a pulp that is washed, groundup, and oxidized in the air. Carbon bisulfide is mixedin, along with caustic soda. The product sits until itreaches the proper consistency, at which time it ispressed into sheets of cellophane or extruded throughsmall openings to yield threads of rayon. Some of thenewer rayon fibers rival natural ones in many of theirphysical attributes. Acetate is a more synthetic fiber,in the sense that the pure cellulose has beenaugmented by acetyl groups during the manufacturingprocess. The cellulose comes from wood or from fibersleft on cottonseeds are they have gone through theginning process. Because the fibers resist wrinkling,they are popular in the manufacture of permanentpress clothing. They are also used to make cigarettefilters.Turpentine is a mixture of essential oils and resins.We extract it from a variety of trees in a variety ofways. About one-quarter of what we produce in thiscountry comes from distilling wood, especially oldstumps and roots of pine trees. About half is producedas a byproduct of the sulfate paper-making processdescribed above.PAPER. One of the most important byproducts of thetimber industry is paper. Before outlining themanufacturing process, a definition is in order. Variouscivilizations used plant tissues to create a surface fortheir writings. We also used animal skins and silkcloth. The Egyptians cut strips of pith from the stemsof the papyrus sedge (Cyperus papyrus). Our word\"paper\" comes from papyrus. Asians also used thepith of the rice paper plant (Fatsia papyrifera), whichis not a kind of rice; and the Polynesians and theMayans both pounded the bark of the paper-mulberry(Broussonetia papyrifera) into sheets. This samespecies is the source of tapa cloth worn by thePolynesians. Early Spanish colonials in the New Worldused century plants and fig leaves. However usefulthese materials might have been, they are not\"paper,\" according to the narrow definition. Truepaper, a Chinese invention from about A. D. 100, ismade by separating plant fibers from one another andthen reconstituting them into thin sheets on a mat orscreen. It has been suggested that observing thepaper-making wasp construct its nest from maceratedwood provided a helpful clue! After drying, the sheetsof paper are peeled away from the surface of thescreen. The earliest true papers were often mixturesof flax, hemp, paper-mulberry, and rags. Until about200 years ago, paper making was labor intensive andtherefore expensive. It comes as a surprise to learnthat since Colonial times until the close of the lastcentury, much of our paper in this country was madeof hemp (Cannabis sativa). Other forms of this samespecies are the source of psychoactive materials andare called marijuana, etc. Therefore, there is no needto mutilate pre-Civil War books by smoking them. Theinvention of movable type by Gutenberg and of paper-making machines made it necessary to look for newsources of plant fibers. Those from wood pulp were anobvious choice.Processing consists of stripping the bark from logs andthen turning them into pulp. In mechanical pulping,debarked logs are forcefully pressed against arevolving grindstone to yield a mush of short woodfibers and fragments. Various agents (bleaches, gums,starches, etc.) may be added. These additives, calledsizings, will produce a paper with a smoother surfaceand one that will accept the printer's ink more readily.The mixture is then floated onto the surface ofscreens. The slurry of fibers begin to interlock withone another, forming a thin mat of plant fibers. Afterdraining and pressing, the paper is wound up in largerolls. One cord of wood will produce about a ton ofpulp. The paper that comes out of this mechanicalpulping process is inexpensive and of poor quality. Itsoon acquires a yellow tinge to it and crumblesrapidly. You encounter it daily (at least I hope youdo!) in the form of newsprint used to make yourfavorite newspaper. Most of the books manufacturedafter about 1850 employed paper made by the sulfiteprocess. The world's libraries are now discovering that-134-their vast holdings of older books are now crumblingas the paper disintegrates. The Library of Congress,probably the world's largest library, is attempting tosave its books from this era by moving them into alarge chamber where the books are treated withdiethyl zinc. This chemical neutralizes the acid residueon the paper.There are three chemical processes used to producepaper pulp. In the sulfite process, wood chips areplaced in a large metal digester and heated underpressure with bisulfites and hot acid. The dissolvedlignins are drained off. The softened fibers ofessentially pure cellulose are then washed and dried.They may be stored in this form or sent on to beatersand the paper-making screens and presses. Thestrong and durable paper is used in many differentproducts, as in kraft wrapping paper. In the sulfateprocess, wood chips are reduced in an alkalinesolution of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide.These chemicals are able to remove resins, waxes,and fats from wood chips. This means that a widervariety of woody plants may be used, including thesoftwoods (conifers). Most of our paper these days ismade this way. In the soda process, sodiumhydroxide is the only digester used. The paper thatresults here is often used in books and magazines.Ninety percent of today's paper is made from woodpulp. Cigarette paper and banknotes are still made outof the linen fibers from flax. Paper made from hemp,straw, and other fibers are produced on a very smallscale. In the United States, we consume about 600lbs. of paper and paperboard per person each year;200 lbs in Britain, under 100 lbs. in France; about 50lbs. in Japan, and 25 lbs. in Russia, and only 2 lbs. perperson per year in The Peoples Republic of China.  Asour demand for paper increases -- the computer agenotwithstanding -- there is renewed interest intraditional pulp sources (hemp, bamboo, etc.) and innew ones. Two new ones of particular interest arekenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus), a cotton relative, andsunn (Crotalaria juncea), a member of the beanfamily.OTHER ODDS AND ENDS. If you subject a piece ofwood to rapidly moving knives or teeth, the result isexcelsior. These thin, curled strands can be madefrom almost any light weight, lightly-colored, odorlesswood. Basswood is especially prized. We use excelsiorfor packing and for stuffing mattresses and furniture.One cord of wood will produce about 1500 lbs. ofexcelsior. Shavings, especially those from white pine,are also used as packing material. Sawdust is used forfuel, bedding, as a packing material, as a soilamendment, and as an ingredient in a number ofindustrial products. Wood flour is finely groundsawdust, shavings, and wood waste. It finds its wayinto linoleum, plastic, nitroglycerin, veneer, flooring,and many other products. I am reminded of the oldjoke about the cow. The only part that isn't used is themoo.SURVEY OF TIMBER TREESTEMPERATE WOODSScots pine (Scotch pine). Pinus sylvestris(Pinaceae) is probably the most important coniferthrough northern Europe and Asia. It is used infurniture, poles, veneers, and it is pulped for makingkraft paper.Eastern white pine. Pinus strobus (Pinaceae) is ourmost famous pine. It is native from southern Canadathrough New England across to the Great Lakes. Whenwe were a British colony, this species was protectedon royal reserves because the trunks were used tomake the masts for sailing ships. After we gained ourindependence, we set about logging vast tracts ofeastern white pine, making it the most often cuttimber tree in the New World. Only about 2% of theoriginal forests remain. Today it is relativelyunimportant because so little remains and because ithas become the victim of the white pine blister rust,a fungal infection introduced from Europe.Longleaf pine. Pinus palustris (Pinaceae) is the bestknown pine from the southeastern United States.Longleaf pine is the heaviest of the commercialsoftwoods. It is very important economically becauseit yields lumber for heavy construction and it is pulpedto make paper. This is the world's leading source ofrosin and turpentine.Ponderosa pine. Pinus ponderosa (Pinaceae) is thesource of more lumber than any other North Americanpine. It is the most widely distributed and importantpine in the West. Its wood is light, hard, and strong.Douglas-fir. Pseudotsuga menziesii (Pinaceae)accounts for about half of the standing timber in thewestern United States and is the source of about 20%of the timber cut each year. It is native to westernNorth America from British Columbia southward alongthe Pacific coast and the Rocky Mountains into Mexico.It reaches its greatest size in our local forests (thelargest being almost 300 ft. tall and 14 ft. indiameter). The wood is highly prized for all kinds ofconstruction. Much of our plywood is made from thisspecies.Redwood. Sequoia sempervirens (Taxodiaceae)grows along the Pacific coast of southern Oregon andCalifornia. Its wood is valuable because it is relativelysoft, light, and resistant to decay. Swellings on thetrunk (burls) are valuable because they yielddecorative lumber that can be turned into table andcounter tops, along with a myriad of strange noveltyitems that tourists love to purchase.White oak. Quercus alba (Fagaceae) is probably themost valuable of several oaks that yield timber. Itswood is used in furniture-making, flooring, and tomake staves for tight cooperage for red wines andthat most elegant of alcoholic beverages, Scotchwhiskey! We import white oak from Europe. It is veryexpensive.Black walnut. Juglans nigra (Juglandaceae) is nativeto much of the eastern United States. On favorablesites it can reach a height of 150 ft. and a diameter of4 ft. The wood is so valuable that I read of walnut treerustling a few years ago. The lumber is heavy, strong,and durable. It is popular in cabinet making and forinterior finishes. The wood from its roots is used tomake gunstocks.Black cherry. Prunus serotina (Rosaceae) is native tomuch of the eastern United States and southeastCanada. It also occurs in North America in Arizona andTexas. While many cherry trees are small, blackcherry can reach a height of 60-80 ft. Its wood isvalued for high quality furniture and interiors. It isalso used in such specialty items as the wooden blocksthat support the electrolyte plates used in printing.Sweet gum. Liquidambar styraciflua (Ham-melidaceae) is a 50-120 ft tall tree native to theeastern United States. Its wood is used to make a-135-beautiful veneer, lumber, plywood, boats, toys, slackcooperage, and boxes. We also chew its sweet sap.Tulip tree. Liriodendron tulipifera (Magnoliaceae) isnative to the eastern portion of the United States. Itis commonly used in plywood, veneer, wood pulp,wood flour, and it is a favorite of wood carvers.TROPICAL WOODSTeak. Tectona grandis (Verbenaceae) is native to theseasonally dry rain forests of southeast Asia. Its woodis one of the world's strongest, most beautiful, mostdurable, and most stable. It is used in flooring,plywood, veneer, and in a variety of marine situations,including shipbuilding.Mahogany. Swietenia mahogani (Meliaceae) is alarge tree native to the West Indies. Soon after itsdiscovery by Spanish explorers, it became popular forshipbuilding and for fine furniture. In fact, itsbeautifully colored wood is so valuable that we havebeen using other species of Swietenia and othergenera in the same family and other families(Leguminosae and Burseraceae) and calling all ofthem mahogany.Rosewood. This is a collective common name forvarious species of Dalbergia and Pterocarpus of theLeguminosae. Its scarcity these days limits its use forsolid wood items, but it is more widely available in theform of a strikingly beautiful veneer. The Brazilianrosewood (D. nigra) has a red-brown wood with blackstreaks.Ebony. Diospyros spp. (Ebenaceae) yields amagnificent black wood or one that combines blackwith brown, grey, and green. The trees are native toIndia and southeast Asia. It is an ancient wood. TheRomans used to purchase it from the East. In additionto its popularity in luxury cabinets, it shows up inspecialty items, such as door knobs, violin fingerboards, bagpipe chanters, castanets, and guitarbacks.COMMERCIAL TIMBER TREESCommon Name

H. & S. R. Chant. 1982.Popular encyclopedia of plants. Cambridge Univ. Press. P.329.CORKTypically, bark is removed during processing to get atthe wood that lies beneath it. There is an importantexception. The cork oak (Quercus suber), native to theMediterranean, has highly desirable bark severalcentimeters thick that can be removed from the plantwithout killing it. Trees are stripped at about age 25and cork may be harvested again every 9 or 10 years.The first cork removed (virgin cork) is inferior to laterstrippings. It will be ground up for wall and floorcoverings. Later strippings will be used to makestoppers, etc. About half of the world's cork comesfrom Portugal; most of the rest from Spain andMorocco. Cork has a number of desirable features. Itsair-filled cells make cork light (it floats in water) andthey are poor conductors of sound and electricity. Itcan be compressed without rupturing its cells, whichwill return to their normal size when the pressure isremoved. Cork does not burn easily, nor does itabsorb odors or flavors readily. While rubber andplastics have replaced cork in some seals and gaskets,it remains popular world-wide because there is nocommonly available synthetic substitute.8.4 ! LATEX PLANTSMost of our familiar herbs and trees have a waterysap. A few have a milky or brightly-colored latex thatoozes from the plant when it is wounded. Although noteasily defined, latex is a colloidal mixture of water,hydrocarbons, salts, resins, acids, and various organicand inorganic constituents. It is formed in specializedcells in the plant and often moves in its own separateplumbing system. The function of latex is uncertain.Perhaps it serves to close injured plant parts or tostore nutrients.SOURCESAbout 2000 species of plants contain latex. Severalplant families characteristically have it, including thespurge family (Euphorbiaceae), milkweed family(Asclepiadaceae), dogbane family (Apocynaceae),sunflower family (Compositae), mulberry family(Moraceae), and sapote family (Sapotaceae).-137-TYPES OF LATEXThe basic building block of the industrially importantlatexes is the isoprene molecule C5H8 -- thousands ofthem linked to one another to form polyisoprene. Thedifference in physical linkage is the basis forrecognizing the two basic kinds of latex: rubber is cis-polyisoprene and gutta or balata is trans-polyisoprene.Category Rubber BalataResilient Yes NoPliable Yes NoBounce? Yes NoMoldable? No YesIsoprene units Cis-form Trans-formPANAMA RUBBERWe begin our survey of latex-bearing plants by lookingat one that is probably unfamiliar to most of us. Myreason for doing so is that this tree was the first to betapped by the indigenous peoples of the New Worldand it would later be confused with the much betterknown Par\u00e1 rubber tree.When Columbus and other early European explorerscame to the New World, they found the indigenouspeoples making a variety of useful items from thelatex of native trees. Two species of Castilla, trees ofthe mulberry family (Moraceae), were chief amongthem. Panama rubber, derived from the latex of C.elastica, was used since ancient times byMesoamerican peoples to make solid and hollowrubber balls and figurines, rubber bands, shoes,vessels, and for waterproofing. It also had medicinaland ritual uses.The famous Mayan ball game used solid rubber ballsabout 15-30 cm in diameter and that weighed up to 7kg made from Panama rubber. We have archeologicalremains as early as 1600 B. C. E.Trees were tapped by cutting into the inner bark ofthe tree. Latex flows until the tree is drained. It is nota pretty sight! If the tree lives, it may take months forit to recover. A mature tree can yield up to 50-70 lbs.of latex. Early Spanish chroniclers noted that the latexwas coagaulated by mixing it with the sap of a localmorning glory, Ipomoea alba. The resulting rubbercould then be shaped into a desired form and itbounced. Crude rubber could be stored or shipped byforming it into flat cakes.Panama rubber remained the primary source of rubberuntil 1850 when it was replaced by Par\u00e1 rubber. Itenjoyed a rebirth of popularity as an emergencysource of rubber latex during World War II.The early history of rubber latex and its sources in theNew World is confusing because both Panama rubberand Par\u00e1 rubber were called \u201cheve\u201d and their latexcalled \u201ccaoutchouc.\u201d PAR\u00c1 RUBBER\u201cRubber dazzled them, as gold and diamonds havedazzled other men and driven them forth to wanderthe waste places of the world. Searching for rubber,they made highways of rivers whose very existencewas unknown to the government authorities, or tomap-makers.

The Spaniards did not seem terribly impressedby all of this and they did not see the potential of the\"weeping woods.\" Perhaps the first reference torubber in the European literature appeared in \"DeOrbo Novo,\" written by Pietro d'Anghiera (1530). Hedescribed the Aztec game balls, \"... made of the juiceof certain herbs ... (which) being stricken upon theground but softly (bounced) incredibly into the ayer.\"Although there is still some question, the rubber treesthat the Spaniards saw and the samples that werelater sent back to France were from the Panamarubber plant (Castilla elastica), a member of themulberry family. Uncertainty as to identification andconflicting reports of the latex content of trees werefinally settled by later expeditions into South America.We now know that the principal latex trees of theAmazonian basin are various species of Hevea,especially H. brasiliensis.Rubber remained relatively unknown in Europe untilthe French astronomer Charles Marie de la Condaminesent samples of \"caoutchouc\" from Peru to France in1736. At first the latex was regarded as nothing morethan a curiosity. Joseph Priestley used it to rub outunwanted pencil marks and supposedly gave the latexits common name of rubber.Although the potentials of rubber latex were realizedby workers of the late 18th and early 19th centuries,it remained an unimportant commodity. There weredefinite drawbacks to the use of rubber. It got brittleand cracked when exposed to the cold, it becamesomewhat fluid and sticky on hot days, and it had amost unpleasant aroma. Caoutchouc became ahousehold item when Macintosh rediscovered that thelatex could be dissolved in naphtha cheaply andefficiently. This made it possible to waterproofgarments. In England, a raincoat is still called amackintosh.The technological discovery that made rubber criticallyimportant was vulcanization. Charles Goodyear orThomas Hancock (accounts vary, depending uponwhether you are American or English) discovered thatby treating the latex with sulfur at high temperatureand pressure, these troublesome changes in itsconsistency could be overcome. Carbon black and zincoxide are added, together with antioxidants to retarddeterioration caused by oxygen and ozone. It wasrecently dis-covered that irradiation with cobalt-60can replace the use of sulfur.Vulcanized rubber was used in the pneumatic tiresreinvented by John Lloyd Dunlop in 1888. Andr\u00e9Michelin in France and Benjamin Franklin Goodrich inthe U. S. began making automobile and bicycle tireson a commercial scale. The need for rubber latex wasnow immense!A few farsighted individuals had seen that thehaphazard methods of collecting the latex from wildtrees of the Amazon Basin would not be sufficient tomeet these new demands. They saw, instead, hugeplantations where rubber trees could be grown andharvested under precise control. Starting such anoperation would require getting thousands of seedsout of South America. But, the Brazilian governmentclamped heavy restrictions on the export of rubbertrees, seedlings, and seeds in an attempt to keepabsolute control of the latex market. They were notaltogether successful. Farris sent 2000 seeds back tothe Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in 1872. Four yearslater Henry Wickham \"acquired\" 70,000 seeds andsent them home to Kew. They were germinated andthe seedlings then sent to the English colonies in theFar East where plantations were begun. A gratefulQueen Victoria would  make him Sir Henry Wickham.Today over 90% of all rubber comes from SoutheastAsia and rubber's ancestral home in Brazil is ofsecondary importance.PROCESSINGRubber plantations are a marvel of organization andefficiency. Work begins very early each day. Theworkers tap the trees by making cuts into the trunk,just deep enough to sever the ends of the latexvessels that lie in the inner bark. Cuts made toodeeply will damage the underlying tissues of the tree.The herringbone pattern of cuts soon begins to oozethe rubber latex. It is collected and taken to a factoryfor processing. The latex is cleaned, filtered, anddiluted. It is also coagulated in large tanks of formic,acetic, or sulfuric acid. A liquid phase, the serum(accounting for about 70% of the latex) is drained off.The latex is then sent to mills to be rolled into sheets.Processing is far from finished. The latex sheets arewashed, freed from impurities, and dried. They areput into large machines called masticators that chewthem up into small chunks of latex. The next stageinvolves mixing the latex with a wide variety of fillers,antioxidants, plasticizers, and coloring materials. Thisstage is critical and the exact proportions are a closelyguarded secret of  each company. The treated latex isnow put into a machine that produces sheets of stockof a desired size and thickness. If strips of rubber ortubes are wanted, then the treated latex is putthrough an extruder. It is then vulcanized.-139-PROCESSING OF LATEX[Initial Processing]Tap treesLCollect latexLAdd ammonia to prevent coagulationLDilute with water, filterLCoagulate(old: over a fire)(new: acetic/formic acid)LConcentrate latex(evaporation or centrifugation)LRoll into sheetsLWash, clean, & dryLSmokeLGradeLStore or transport[Final Processing]Mastication(machines reduce stored latex)LBlendLAdditives(carbon black, plasticizers, coloring agents)LVulcanizationNATURAL RUBBER PRODUCTION(metric tons)1826 161870 15,0001900 52,0001920 302,0001940 1,127,0001947 1,275,0001950 1,750,0001960 2,095,0001970 2,986,3001980 3,748,1081990 5,223,8852000 6,825,4752003 7,437,129NATURAL ALTERNATIVES TO PAR\u00c1 RUBBERDuring the Second World War, rubber sources werecut off from us because of the occupation of certainAsian countries. Our government became intenselyinterested in two alternatives -- other latex sourcesand the development of synthetic rubber. Other plantsinvestigated were:guayule (Parthenium argentatum), a shrub of thesunflower family native to Texas and adjacent Mexico;Russian dandelion (Taraxacum koksaghyz), ofCentral Asia, which the Russians had been working onsince the 1930's; and therubber vine (Cryptostegia spp.), native to the OldWorld, but introduced into Mexico and North America.MINOR LATEX-BEARING PLANTSAFRICAN OR RED RUBBER. Landolphia gummiferaand other species of the same genus yield red rubber.It is also called African and Madagascar rubber. Thelarge woody vines are members of the dogbane family(Apocynaceae). The fact that they produced a latexwas discovered in 1850 by T. L. Wilson, a missionaryto Africa. By the turn of the century, the profits fromthese vines would finance the first stage of formalcolonial rule in Central Africa.One of the more horrendous chapters in the history ofthat continent involves Leopold II, King of theBelgians, who personally owned most or all of tropicalwest Africa. The region may have been called theBelgian Congo, but the land belonged to the King, notthe country. He leased huge portions of it to outsidecommercial interests. Those folks paid him tribute andtaxes. It is estimated that Leopold received 1/5 of allthe profits made on ivory tusks and red rubber.Villages had quotas of latex assigned to them. Thenative Africans who failed to meet their quotas wereflogged, tortured, mutilated by having their hands cutoff, or simply killed. The wives and children of themale workers were held as hostages. This happenedto tens of thousands of Africans. In 1908, the Belgiangovernment, reacting to world outrage, confiscatedthe holdings of King Leopold.\u201cThe worst feature in connection with this particularrubber industry, however, was the barbaroustreatment of the natives. The story of the operationsin the Belgian Congo during the reign of Leopold II willalways remain one of the bleake(sAt lpbaegrte sF .i nH ihlli,s t1o9r5y2.\u201d)GUAYULE. Parthenium argentatum is the only nativeU. S. plant that has been used commercially as a latexsource. It was studied intensively during World War II.The latex is much inferior to its competitors,principally because of its resin content. The juice isextracted by macerating the plants.CHICL\u00c9. Manilkara zapota is native to the New Worldtropics. It used to be the principal source of chewinggum latex. The industrial demands were so great thatother sources were also used. Today's chewing gumuses polyvinyl acetate and microcrystalline waxesinstead.The chewing gum industry is an offshoot of the rubberindustry. According to one account, the manresponsible for chewing gum is none other thanGeneral Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. A few yearsafter his defeat by Sam Houston, the General went toNew York with a piece of chicle that he thought wouldbe a good rubber substitute. There he met ThomasAdams, who was not that impressed by a series ofless than successful demonstrations. Adams did note,however, that during their conversations the Generalchewed the latex. The rest is history.GUTTA-PERCHA. Palaquium gutta is native to theMalayan region. The trees are usually cut down duringthe extraction process. The latex is hard at roomtemperature, oxidizes rapidly, and should be keptunder water. It is a very poor conductor of electricity.Gutta-percha is used to insulate submarine cables, ingolf ball centers, and in dentistry. If you have had rootcanal work, you probably have some gutta percha inyour mouth.-140-SYNTHETIC RUBBERNo other natural latex source has proven satisfactory.Synthetic rubber, on the other hand, has been a greatsuccess. Chemists found that butadiene and styrenecan be combined to form a polymer much like that ofnatural rubber. Both molecules can be obtained fromcoal, petroleum, and alcohol. Much of what wepurchase today is a mixture of natural and artificialrubber. It is often referred to as \u201cSBR,\u201d styrenebutadiene rubber.As you will note from the following data, there was adramatic increase in synthetic rubber productionbeginning in the 1940's. This was obviously linked tothe need for rubber by the U. S. military and theoccupation of the plantations of Southeast Asia by theJapanese.SYNTHETIC RUBBER PRODUCTION(metric tons)1940 43,0001945 800,0001950 583,0001960 2,021,0001980 8,690,0002002 10,880,000LATEX-BEARING PLANTSCommon Name (Scientific Name)                                     Family CommentAssam rubber (Ficus elastica) Mulberry Another name for India rubber plantbalata (Manilkara bidentata) Sapote Especially good for machine beltsBorneo rubber (Willughbeia coriacea) Dogbane Malaysian; coagulated by salt watercastilla rubber (Castilla spp.) Mulberry C.

GUMS, RESINS, ANDEXUDATESIf there is a more familiar term for gums, resins, andvarious plant exudates, it would be oozings or gunk. The discussion that follows is not that satisfactory,mainly because it is so difficult to distinguish thecategories from one another.GUMSGums are noncrystalline mixtures of carbohydratesand organic acids that exude from plants. They oftenharden on exposure to air and swell to produce aviscous dispersion or solution when added to water.They are insoluble in alcohol, ether, and many otherreagents. They will char, but will not burn freely. Theirrole within the plant body is not thoroughlyunderstood. Some experts believe that gums help toheal wounded plants and to store water. We are notable to digest gums completely, so to us they areessentially inert substances.Gums have a variety of uses. Many of them aresizings, substances spread on cloth or paper to glazeor coat them. They stiffen and strengthen fibersduring processing. We often wash or steam the sizingsout of clothing before we wear them.Four of our most important gums are derived frommembers of the bean family (Leguminosae). GumArabic (Acacia spp., especially A. senegal) comes froma plant that lives in North Africa, India, and Arabia.The gum exudes from exposed underbark. It is usedin adhesives, confections, polishes, inks, andmedicines. Gum tragacanth (Astragalus spp.), comesfrom plants native to western Asia and southeasternEurope. It also yields sizings, adhesives, andmedicines. Gum from the locust bean (Ceratoniasiliqua) is used in papermaking and as a stabilizer infoods. Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba) is an Indianplant used in salad dressings and ice cream. RESINS AND OTHER EXUDATESThis assemblage of exudates is not easilycharacterized. Many resins appear to be the result ofreduction and polymerization of starches and othercarbohydrates. Others seem to be oxidative productsof essential oils. Resins often have high molecularweights. They are typically brittle, and more or lesstransparent. Resins are insoluble in water and more orless soluble in ordinary reagents. Their function withinthe plant remains incompletely understood. They areusually seen when it is wounded. Resins are typicallyfound in special ducts or canals within the plant.Resins have been used since ancient times as acaulking material, in all-weather torches, asembalming agents, medicine, and materials forpainting. While resins are found in many plants, theycome primarily from species in three families -- thepines (Pinaceae), legumes (Leguminosae), and thedipterocarps (Dipterocarpaceae).TURPENTINE is a mixture of the resins and essentialoils, an oleoresin, found in the resin canals in the barkand sapwood of various conifers. The crude materialthat exudes from the plant is called pitch. It isdistilled to separate the resin from the essential oil.The production and processing of pitch is called thenaval stores industry. Turpentine manufacture inthe U. S. started in the Carolinas. Longleaf pine andslash pine were the principal sources. The tappingprocedures themselves have remained relativelyunchanged. Crude pitch is gathered every week. Thepitch is then diluted and filtered. It is then treatedwith acid to yield a lighter, more valuable grade ofresin. Water is added to remove the traces of acid. Itis then distilled. Oil or spirit of turpentine boils offfirst. A heavier residue, rosin, remains behind. Therosin is screened, cooled, and hardened. The oil will beused as a solvent. The rosin will be used in soaps,varnishes, inks, waxes, and lubricants. It is alsorubbed on violin bows.AMBER is the resin of an extinct pine (Pinussuccinifer). Its origin remained a mystery for manycenturies. It was once thought to be made by thesun's rays or to be petrified whale sperm. Ambervaries from yellow to black. The lighter colors will getdarker upon continued exposure to light. Amberpolishes up well and is often incorporated into jewelry.When rubbed, it takes on a negative charge. One ofthe most fascinating aspects of amber is that insectsthat were flying about when the trees were exudingthe resin sometimes became trapped in the viscousmaterial, just as they do today. This means that wehave available to us now the amazingly well preservedremains of insects, millions of years old, trapped inthe amber. Large chunks of amber are quiteexpensive. The largest specimen that I know aboutweighed 18 lbs. and sold for $30 million.BALSAMS are oleoresins that contain benzoic orcinnamic acid. They are typically highly aromatic.Balsam-of-Peru, the resin found in Myroxylonbalsamum of the New World tropics, has been used toheal persistent sores, as a fixative in perfumes, as avanilla substitute, and as an ingredient in arrowpoisons, soaps, and consecrated oils.LACQUER is the resin obtained from Rhus verniciferaand other plants of the cashew family(Anacardiaceae). These shrubs are native to China,Japan, and other countries in the Old World. The resinis milky when it comes out of the plant, but it darkensupon exposure to the air. Sometimes as many as 300layers of lacquer are applied to furniture. Becausethese resins are from plants closely related chemicallyto those found in poison ivy-oak-sumac group, someindividuals will have an allergic reaction to furnituretreated with these lacquers.MIXTURES OF GUMS AND RESINS. You haveperhaps heard of three of them that were once morepopular than they are now. Frankincense is anexudate scrapped from the trunk and branches ofBoswellia carteri and B. fiereana, trees of the burserafamily (Burseraceae). The elephant tree that lives insouthern California is one of the few members of thisfamily in our part of the world. Frankincense was onceimportant as a fumigant and it was used in medicineand in embalming. It was also traded. Myrrh is asimilar material that comes from Commiphora spp.,African trees in the same family.Asafetida is a truly foul-smelling, milky juice thatexudes from the roots of Ferula assafoetida, an herbin the carrot or parsley family (Umbelliferae). Itenjoyed limited popularity as a medicine, often byhanging a bag of asafetida around the neck. I suspectthat this malodorous gunk did reduce the spread ofillness by keeping people from getting too close to-142-someone using it.GUMS AND RESINSProduct (Source) Plant Family or GroupGUMSAgar (Gelidium spp., etc.) Red algaeAlgin (Ascophyllum spp., etc.) Brown algaeArabic (Acacia senegal, etc.) BeanCarob (Ceratonia siliqua) BeanCarrageenan (Chondrus crispus) Red algaeCatechu (Acacia catechu) BeanFurcellaran (Furcellaran fastigiata) Red algaeGhatti (Anogeissus latifolia) CombretumGuar (Cyamopsis tetragonolobus) BeanKaraya (Sterculia urens) SterculiaLarch (Larix occidentalis) PineLocust bean (Ceratonia siliqua) BeanTragacanth (Astragalus gummifer) BeanRESINSOpopanax (Opopanax chironium) ParsleyPitch  (Pinus australis) PineTurpentine (Pinus australis) PineOLEORESINSBalm of Gilead (Abies balsamea) PineCanada balsam (Abies balsamea) PineElemi (Several different plants) BurseraMastic (Pistacia lentiscus) CashewHARD RESINSAmber (Pinus succinifer) PineCopals (Hymenaea and related genera) BeanDammars (Hopea + related genera) DipterocarpDragon blood (Dracaena draco) Century plantLacquer (Rhus and related genera) CashewBALSAMSBalsam of Peru (Myroxylon balsamum) BeanBalsam of Tolu (Myroxylon balsamum) BeanBenzoin (Styrax benzoin) StyraxGUM RESINSAsafetida (Ferula assafoetida) ParsleyFrankincense (Boswellia carteri) BurseraGamboge (Garcinia hanburyi) MangosteenMyrrh (Commiphora spp.) BurseraSource: Hill (1952)8.6 -  STARCH PLANTSStarch may be the most widely distributed organiccompound found in plants and it occurs in practicallyall parts of the plant. Although it is usually producedin the leaves as a temporary storage form forphotosynthetic products, it is primarily in seeds, roots,and a few stems where it is stored permanentlyenough and in sufficiently large quantities to make itsextraction economically feasible. Starch occurs withinthe plant body as insoluble granules that havecharacteristic sizes, shapes, and striations. Experts insuch matters can tell the source of a starch sample byexamining these granules under a compoundmicroscope.The most common sources of commercial starch aremaize, the potato, wheat, rice, sorghum, cassava,arrowroot, and the sago palm.Starch is a glucose polymer. So is cellulose. Thedifference between the two is the nature of thechemical bond that unites the glucose molecules toone another. In starch they are \u00e1-bonds; in cellulosethey are &-bonds. Now you know! In starch theindividual glucose building-blocks are linked in a lineararray (amyloses) or in a branched configuration(amylopectins). Because \u00e1-bonds are more easilyattacked by enzymes, starch can be broken downmore readily than cellulose. Alpha-amylase is theenzyme that occurs in our saliva and pancreatic juicethat breaks down starch into simpler sugars. Completehydrolysis of starch will yield glucose.Starch has many uses. We produce billions of tons ofit each year in the United States, with 95% of thestarch coming from maize. You may be surprised tolearn that about 60% of the starch used in thiscountry goes into the paper and cardboard industry,as sizings. A size is a substance used to fill in thepores of paper or cloth to make the surface appearmore uniform. In the textile industry, starch is used tostrengthen fibers and to make thread easier to weave.Laundries use starch to give a shirt a more finishedappearance. In the food industry, starch is athickening agent. On a much smaller scale, we do thesame thing in our kitchens when we thicken gravy.Starch has a number of cosmetic applications, as invarious soothing powders.We manufacture much of our industrial alcohol fromstarch. The process is essentially the same as thatused to produce ethyl alcohol, the kind found in beer,wine, and distilled beverages. The difference is thatindustrial alcohol has been denatured -- renderedundrinkable -- by adding methyl alcohol to it. Perhapsthe least known use of starch is in the manufacture ofexplosives. Cellulose + nitric acid \u00fb nitrocellulose.Starch + nitric acid \u00fb nitrostarch. Toward the end ofWorld War II, the United States was using almost 2million lbs. of nitrostarch a month to make theexplosives for hand grenades.-143-STARCH PLANTSCommon & Scientific Name Plant FamilyAir potato (Dioscorea bulbifera) YamAmerican cabbage palm (Roystonea oleracea) PalmArrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) Prayer plantBread tree (Encephalartos altensteinii) CycadCassava (Manihot esculenta) SpurgeCocoyam (Xanthosoma atrovirens) AroidCorn (Zea mays) GrassCush-cush (Dioscorea trifida) YamDasheen (Colocasia esculenta) AroidEast Indian arrowroot (Curcuma angustifolia) GingerFijian arrowroot (Tacca leontopetaloides) TaccaGiant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma chamissonis) AroidGiant taro (Alocasia macrorhiza) AroidGomuti palm (Arenga pinnata) PalmGreater Asiatic yam (Dioscorea alata) YamJapanese sago palm (Cycas revoluta) CycadKaffir bread (Encephalartos caffer) CycadMaize (Zea mays) GrassManioc (Manihot esculenta) SpurgePotato (Solanum tuberosum) NightshadeQueensland arrowroot (Canna edulis) CannaRice (Oryza sativa) GrassSago palm (Arenga pinnata) PalmSago palm (Caryota urens) PalmSago palm (Cycas circinalis) CycadSago palm (Metroxylon sagu) PalmTanier (Xanthosoma atrovirens) AroidTaro (Colocasia esculenta) AroidWheat (Triticum spp.) GrassWhite Guinea yam (Dioscorea rotundata) YamYam (Dioscorea spp.) YamYampee (Dioscorea trifida) YamYellow Guinea yam (Dioscorea cayenensis) Yam-144-8.7 ! ESSENTIAL OILSIn the section on spices and flavorings, I mentionedthat spices usually owe their desirable qualities to theessential oils that they contain. They are characterizedby their ability to evaporate readily, by their aromaticodors, and by their pleasing taste. These essential orvolatile oils are different from the fatty or fixed oils.From a chemical standpoint, essential oils arecomplex. They are often benzene or terpenederivatives or hydrocarbons of intermediate molecularlength. Some contain sulfur and nitrogen. Typicallythey are liquids. Their function in the plant is stilluncertain. Essential oils are often found in flowers, butthey may be found in other plant parts. They aretypically produced in special glands.Essential oils are widely used in perfumes,deodorants, and soaps. They also flavor manybeverages and tobacco mixtures. Industrial usesinclude insecticides, solvents for paints, and as aningredient in glue, paste, and polish. Some haveantiseptic properties and are useful in medicine.EXTRACTION METHODSDISTILLATION. When an essential oil is not solublein water (immiscible), steam distillation or boiling maybe used. A layer of oil separates from a layer of water.Hot water or live steam is injected into a still filledwith the aromatic plant part. Both vaporize and arethen condensed into an adjacent receptacle. When theoil and water are miscible, it is necessary to usetechniques that take into account the different boilingand volatilization temperatures. In this process, thereis a gradual increase in temperature, with the morevolatile essential oils distilling off first. Severaldistillations may be necessary.ENFLEURAGE (COLD FAT EXTRACTION).Distillation can ruin certain oils by the chemicalprocesses of hydrolysis, polymerization, or the loss ofa delicate oil in relatively large quantities of water.Enfluerage is the process of applying fresh flowers orother aromatic plant parts to glass plates covered withpure tallow and lard. These absorb the essential oilsfrom the plant. The saturated fat is then subjected toalcoholic extraction. This dissolves the trappedessential oil, but not the insoluble fat. The essential oilis then concentrated. Much of this process involveslaborious hand labor in which women with tweezersremove wilted petals and replace them with freshones.SOLVENT EXTRACTION. Fresh flowers and asolvent, often petroleum ether, are placed in anextractor. The ether dissolves out the essential oil,along with other impurities. The ether is then removedby a vacuum. All of this is done at room temperature.The principal drawbacks of this process are theexpensive equipment required and the precise controlneeded.EXPRESSION. This process involves the squeezing ofplant material under great pressure, either in handpresses or in giant mechanical devices.

FIXED OIL PLANTS\u201cThe diesel engine can be fed with vegetable oils andwould help considerably in the development ofagriculture of the countries which will use it.\u201d(Rudolph Diesel, 1911)' ' ' ' 'In the last section, we looked at volatile, aromatic oils.Clearly, there are other kinds of oils produced byplants; ones that are not volatile and that are more orless odorless. These are the fixed oils. They are alsoknown as vegetable oils and fatty oils. Plants thathave high fatty oil content often are rich in proteins aswell. Chemically they are very closely related to fatsand waxes. Waxes are esters of certain alcohols.Because they are impervious to water, they serve toprotect the plant and we use them in the same way.Fats and oils are glycerides of organic acids. They are-146-typically a mixture of several of these fatty acids. Thedistinction between the two is rather simple andarbitrary: fats are more or less solid at roomtemperate, while oils are liquids. A fat on a summerday in Humboldt County may be an oil in Redding.An important chemical consideration in  vegetable oilsis the degree of saturation of chemical bonds in thefatty acids. The more double bonds, the more likely itis that the oil will dry to a waterproof film. Less doublebonding means that the oil will remain a liquid for along period of time after exposure to air. The ability ofa fixed oil to absorb iodine correlates directly with itsdrying properties. The higher the number of iodineions incorporated into the positions of double bondsalong the fatty acid chain, the more likely it is that theoil will oxidize to an elastic film. This index is knownas the iodine number. It is the number of grams ofiodine absorbed by 100 grams of fat. The range iniodine numbers is about 7 to 200+.IODINE NUMBERS OF FIXED OILSFixed Oil Iodine NumberLinseed oil 165-204Tung oil 160-175Soybean oil 137-143Safflower oil 140-150Sunflower oil 119-135Corn oil 111-135Cottonseed oil 108-110Canola oil 94-105Sesame oil 103-108Rapeseed oil 94-102Peanut oil 84-100Caster oil 81-89Olive oil 78-88Palm oil 51-77Cacao butter 32-41Palm kernel oil 13-17Coconut oil 7-10Source: Schery (1972) and Simpson & Ogorzaly (1995)DRYING CAPACITY OF FIXED OILSNondrying oils have little or no linoleic or linolenicacid and a low iodine number (less than 100).Examples include: palm oil, peanut oil, olive oil, castoroil, rapeseed oil, almond oil, avocado oil, cacao butter,cashew oil.Semi-drying oils lack appreciable amounts oflinolenic acid, often are rich in linoleic acid, and haveintermediate iodine numbers (100-130). Examplesinclude: cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil,croton oil, corn oil.Drying oils are high in both linoleic and linolenicacids and have high iodine numbers (over 130).Examples include: linseed oil, soybean oil, tung nutoil, hemp seed oil, poppy seed oil, safflower oil, perillaoil, Par\u00e1 rubber oil.Source: Schery (1972) and Simpson & Ogorzaly (1995)SATURATION OF EDIBLE OILSThis feature of the degree to which vegetable oils aresaturated carries over into dietary concerns. Saturatedfats and oils have a hydrogen atom bonded to eachcarbon atom of its molecule. If there is one unbondedsite, the fat or oil is mono-unsaturated; if there areseveral, it is poly-unsaturated. Saturated fats/oilscome mostly from consuming animal products (meat,milk, butter, and cheese), but they also come fromthe \u201ctropical oils,\u201d such as coconut, cocoa, and palm.Common examples of monounsaturated oils includeolive, avocado, peanut, and canola. Polyunsaturatedfats and oils may be further subdivided into omega-3'sthat come from flax, seafood, and lean meat; andomega-6's that come primarily from various fruits andseeds.EXTRACTION AND PROCESSINGA variety of both tropical and temperate plants yieldfixed oils. While vegetable oils are found present invarious plant organs, most of the important ones arefound in seeds. They are extracted in much the sameway that we get essential oils out of a plant. The seedcoat is removed and the interior reduced to a finemeal. The oil is removed by a solvent or by expressingit under pressure. It is then filtered and often purifiedfurther. Higher grades of fixed oils go into foodproducts; the lower grades have a variety of industrialuses. The oils may also be bleached and deodorized.SURVEY OF FIXED OIL PLANTSSoybean oil (Glycine max). The soybean, native toeastern Asia, is one of our most ancient oil sources. Itwas one of the five \"sacred grains\" of China. The oilcontent is 13-25%. Soybean oil is used in margarine,shortening, salad oils, whipped toppings, and icings.Its industrial uses include paint, linoleum, printing ink,soap, candles, insecticides, disinfectants, cosmetics,and plastics.Coconut oil (Cocos nucifera). The oil is expressedfrom copra, the dried coconut flesh. The oil content ishigh, 65-70%. The refined oil is used in foods,especially margarines. Lower grades are found insoaps, cosmetics, salves, shaving creams, shampoos,and as an illuminant.Oil palms. Two other palms are also importantsources of fixed oils. The African oil palm (Elaeisguineensis) bears fruit after about 4 or 5 years. Theyare cut from or knocked off the tree and thenprocessed quickly to keep naturally occurring enzymesfrom destroying the oil. The fleshy meso-carp yields45-55% oil used in margarine, cooking fats, soaps,and candles. Taxi cabs in some tropical cities run onpalm oil. A different fixed oil is found in theendosperm of the seed (palm kernel oil). It ischemically similar to coconut oil and is used in icecreams, mayonnaise, toilet soaps, and detergents.The endosperm is about 50% oil. The cake thatremains after expressing the palm oils is used inlivestock food. This plant has the highest yield of oil ofany crop (3475 kg per hectare per year).The American oil palm (Elaeis oleifera) appears to benative to Central and South America. It is closelyrelated to the African oil palm and the two hybridizefreely. It is not as important a source of fixed oil.Canola oil (Brassica spp.). There is no canola plantgrowing out there. The name derives from theCanadian Oil Low Acid research project that developedit in the 1960's from rapeseed oil. Some cultivars arehigh in toxic erucic acid. These oils are used inindustry, often as lubricants. The strains that are lowin erucic acid were approved by the United StatesFood and Drug Administration in 1985 as a food.Canola low has a long shelf life.-147-Meadowfoam oil (Limnanthes spp.). Variousspecies of meadowfoam are native to valleygrasslands and vernal pools in California and Oregon.It is a current subject of much research. It can becultivated as an annual crop and perhaps grown in ricefields. The plan is to use the oil as a substitute forsperm whale oil. The U. S. once imported about 50million pounds per year.Castor oil (Ricinus communis). The ornamentalcastor bean plant is also the source of an importantindustrial oil. The United States is the largestimporter. The oil content of the seed varies from 35-55%. Castor oil is found in soap, synthetic rubber,linoleum, inks, nylons, and as a lubricant in airplaneand rocket engines. About 1% of the production goesinto a more refined version that is used in medicine,where it is called \"oleum ricini.\" It is a very effectivepurgative, an agent that causes evacuation of thebowels.Olive oil (Olea europea). The olive tree, native towestern Asia, is another of our most ancient plants. Itis probably the most important of the non-drying oils.The oil is not extracted from the seed itself, but fromthe fruit pulp that surrounds it. Two to four pressingsare often involved, the first of which yields thegreenish-yellow \"virgin\" oil. If the fruits were from thehighest quality trees, processed in a particular way(mechanical vs. chemical extraction), meet certainaesthetic standards, and have less than 1% free oleicacid, then the product can be called \"extra virgin\"olive oil. Use of the term is regulated by theInternational Olive Oil Council (IOOC). The U. S. is nota member, but California producers have formed theCOOC. Olive oil has a prominent role as a salad andcooking oil. It has a long shelf life.  Hippies andYuppies have been known to get all misty-eyed whendiscussing the virtues of olive oil. Later pressings findtheir way into soap, lubricants, and medicines.Linseed oil (Linum usitatissimum). We grow somecultivars of flax for their fibers and others for the oilcontent in their seeds (32-43%). Linseed oil is used inpaint, oilcloth, soft soaps, varnish, ink, linoleum, andto seal various surfaces, including concrete highways.Safflower oil (Carthamus tinctorius). This memberof the sunflower family is known only in cultivation.The ancient Egyptians appear to be the first to haveused it. The oil content of the seeds is about 40%. Ithas the highest percentage of linoleic acid. Saffloweroil has become a very popular cooking oil because itis low in cholesterol. It is also used in shortening,margarine, salad oils, and mayonnaise.Peanut oil (Arachis hypogaea). The peanut isnative to South America, perhaps to Brazil. It hasbecome a major crop in the United States, especiallyin the South. The seeds have oil content of 30-45%.The higher grades of peanut oil are used in margarineand shortening, and to pack sardines. The inferiorgrades end up in soap, lubricants, and illuminants.Corn oil (Zea mays). The oil content is about 50%.Corn oil is used in cooking and salads (Mazola oil), andto make margarine. It smokes when heated to hightemperatures. Industrial uses include soap, paints,and in rubber substitutes.Cottonseed oil (Gossypium spp.). Cotton seedscontain about 35% oil. Refined oils are used incooking and salad oils, margarine, and shortening.Processing inactivates gossypol, a toxin found inglands within the seed. Inferior grades end up insoaps. Cottonseed oil is the most important of thesemi-drying oils.FIXED (NON-AROMATIC) OIL PLANTSFixed Oil Scientific Name FamilyMAJOR OIL CROPS:African palm oil Elaeis guineensis palmAmerican palm oil Elaeis oleifera palmcastor oil Ricinus communis spurgecoconut oil Cocos nucifera palmcorn oil Zea mays grasscotton seed oil Gossypium spp. mallowlinseed oil Linum usitatissimum flaxolive oil Olea europaea olivepeanut oil Arachis hypogaea beanrapeseed (rape) oil Brassica spp. mustardsesame oil Sesamum indicum pedaliumsoybean oil Glycine max beansunflower oil Helianthus annuus sunflowerMINOR OIL CROPS:babassu oil Orbignya phalerata palmben oil Moringa pterygosperma moringaBrazil nut oil Bertholletia excelsa Brazil nutbuffalo gourd oil Cucurbita foetidissima squashcajeput oil Melaleuca leucadendron myrtlecandlenut oil Aleurites moluccana spurgecanola oil Brassica napus, B. campestris mustardcarapa oil Carapa guianensis mahoganycashew nut oil Anacardium occidentale cashewchaulmoogra oil Hydnocarpus kurzii flacourtia-148-China wood oil Aleurites fordii spurgecocoa butter oil Theobroma cacao sterculiacohune oil Orbignya cohune palmcolza oil Brassica napus mustardcroton oil Croton tiglium spurgeeng oil Dipterocarpus tuberculatus dipterocarpgorli oil Oncoba echinata flacourtiagurgum (gurjun) oil Dipterocarpus spp. dipterocarphempseed oil Cannabis sativa hempillipe nut oil Shorea macrophylla dipterocarpjojoba oil Simmondsia chinensis simmondsiakapok seed oil Ceiba pentandra bombaxlicuri oil Syagrus coronata palmmacassar oil Schleichera oleosa soapberrymeadowfoam Limnanthes spp. meadowfoammurumuru oil Astrocaryum murumuru palmmustard oil Sinapis spp. and Brassica spp. mustardNiger seed oil Guizotia abyssinica sunfloweroiticica oil Licania rigida coco plumpeach oil Prunus persica roseperilla oil Perilla frutescens mintpistachio oil Pistacia vera cashewpoppy seed oil Papaver somniferum poppysafflower oil Carthamus tinctorius sunflowertung oil Aleurites fordii spurgewalnut oil Juglans regia walnut -149-8.9 ! TANNINS AND DYESTannins and dyes are secretion products found almostuniversally in plants. They are usually notconcentrated enough to make extractions worthwhile.Tannins and dyes are combinations of carbon,hydrogen, and oxygen. Nitrogen is present in somecases. Dyes, in particular, have been largely replacedby synthetic derivatives of coal tars. Only about 10%of our currently used dyes are of natural origins.TANNINSThis term is applied to a wide variety of astringentsubstances. Generally speaking, they are metabolicbreakdown products of sugars. Tannins are watersoluble and are chemical reducing agents. Thefunction of tannins within the plant body is obscure.Perhaps they play a protective role. They are usuallyfound in out of the way places, such as heartwood orthe cork, rather than sites of active growth ormovement of materials.The principal use of tannins is in the tanning industry.They combine with proteins in animal skin to yieldleather, which is resistant to water, air, temperaturechanges, and bacterial attack. During the tanningprocess, the animal skin is soaked in a tanninextraction for a period of time ranging from just a fewhours to several months. The leather can then befurther treated with oils to restore some pliability anddyed.Tannins also combine with iron salts to form the basisof several inks. Tannins have some medical uses, suchas antidotes to alkaloid and heavy metal poisoning,and in reducing gastric bleeding and diarrhea.SURVEY OF TANNIN PLANTSChestnut (Castanea dentata). Tannins are extractedfrom the wood. This source has practicallydisappeared in the U.S. because of excessive loggingand the chestnut blight.Tanner's dock or canaigre (Rumex hymeno-sepalus). An annual species of the south-western U.S.The roots contain 25-35% tannins.Sumac (Rhus coriaria). The species is native to Sicily.The leaves contain about 35% tannins. Our nativespecies of Rhus also have tannins in them, but theyare inferior in their tanning ability.Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). This coniferous treelargely replaced the chestnut, but now it is alsodisappearing. The bark contains 8-14% tannins. T.heterophylla of the western U.S. has become moreimportant as a tannin source since the decline of theeastern hemlock.Quebracho (Schinopsis lorentzii). This plant is theforemost source of natural tannins. The tree is nativeto Argentina and Paraguay. The wood contains about22% tannins. The U.S. imports great quantities ofquebracho tannins each year.Mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). The bark contains55-58% tannins after concentration. This is one of thecheapest tannin sources. The U.S. is the chiefimporter.Wattle (Acacia spp.). These trees are usually nativeto Australia. They are now widely planted. The barkcontains about 50% tannins.Gambier (Uncaria gambir). This species is native tothe East Indies. A resin in the leaves contains 35-40%tannins.DYESWhether natural or synthetic, dyes are chemicallyrelatively straightforward. Fustic, for example, has theempirical formula C13H10O6. As with tannins, thefunction that the dye performs in plants is not wellunderstood.Dyes have been in use for thousands of years. No oneknows how many different dyes there are, but aconservative estimate is at least 2000.When dyes were first used to color and decorate cloth,they were impermanent and faded rather quickly. Thecolors would also change with time. It was necessaryto fix and bind the dye with the fibers of the cloth.This was done by using a mordant. Most of themordants are salts of metals. By using a differentmordant with a specific dye, the color value of the dyemay be changed.SURVEY OF DYE PLANTSWoad (Isatis tinctoria). This plant is perhaps native tosouthern Russia. Its use spread rapidly, however. Theleaves contain a glucoside, indican. The leaves arecrushed by rollers to extract a pulpy material. This isrolled into a ball and dried. The balls are laterpulverized, wetted, and fermented. The woad is thendried once more and may be stored in this form.When it is to be used, fermentation is once morerequired. Two uses of woad are of some historicalinterest. When the Romans invaded Briton, they foundthe inhabitants using woad to decorate their bodies.Later in English history, woad and a yellow dye weremixed to yield the \"Saxon Green\" dye worn by RobinHood and his Merry Men.Indigo (Indigofera tinctoria). This is one of the bestknown dyes. It is a brilliant blue. Oxidation is requiredbefore the color develops. Fresh cut leaves are soakedfor about half a day and aerated. The blue precipitatethat develops settles out. This is dried and becomesthe \"indigo cake.\" When indigo became popular, it metstiff resistance from the woad dyers (the \"Woadites\").In 1577, England \"...prohibited under the severestpenalties... the newly invented, harmful, balefullydevouring, pernicious, deceitful, eating and corrosivedye known as 'the devil's dye'....\"Madder (Rubia tinctorum). The brilliant red dye isextracted from the roots. The roots are washed, dried,and then pulverized. The color of madder will varywith the mordant.Logwood (Haematoxylon campechianum). This treeis native to Mexico and Central America. The dye isextracted from the heartwood. The dark purple dye isused on cotton, leather, furs and silk. Logwood is alsothe basis of a black ink and the histological stainwidely used in biology.Annatto (Bixa orellana). The annatto plant is nativeto Brazil, but it is now very widely planted. The dyecomes from the pulp around the seeds. It may beextracted with water or some solvent, such as-150-chloroform. Annatto is an orange dye that is widelyused as a food coloring in cheese, butter, andmargarine; as a condiment on rice; as a dye; as a skinpaint; and as an ingredient in lipstick.Saffron (Crocus sativus). This was the principalyellow dye of ancient times. It is extracted from thestigmas of the flowers.Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius). This thistle-likeplant is native to Asia. The dye is obtained from theflowering heads. This dye has been used as a saffronsubstitute. Safflower is also the source of an importantoil.DYE PLANTS OF THE U.

BAMBOOS &GOURDSPlants of industry and technology suggest those thatare the basis of large and sophisticated corporateentities, such as rubber, cotton, and timber. There aremany other plants that are used locally andindividually by peoples around the world. In therealms of economic botany and anthropology, theseconstitute examples of the material culture ortechnology of a culture.To my way of thinking, the bamboos and the cucurbitsor squashes, offer us many excellent examples ofthese \u201cnon-corporate\u201d plants of industry.BAMBOOS\u201cIt is quite possible not to eat meat, but not to bewithout bamboo.\u201d (Su Dongpo, Song Dynasty poet)\u201cBamboo is my brother.\u201d (Vietnamese proverb)' ' ' ' 'Bamboos, or tree grasses as they are sometimescalled, constitute one subfamily of the grasses.

We have good fossil remains fromEgypt (3500 BCE), from Peru (12,000 BP), and fromMexico and Thailand (7000 BCE). Was it distributed inPre-Columbian times by us or by ocean currents? Bothviews have their advocates. The exterior of this gourdis tough, almost woody, and more or less imperviousto water. That explains its ability to float longdistances and its use as a container. The bottle gourdis also a favorite of artists who paint on or carveintricate designs in its woody surface.The loofa (loofah, luffa) or vegetable sponge(Luffa aegyptiaca) is native to the Old World. Maturefruits the softer outer skin and inner flesh have rottedaway. Once the seeds have been removed, theremaining vascular system (the plumbing system ofthe fruit) is bleached to yield the familiar luffa sponge.You may have one hanging in your bathroom or youknow someone who does. The next time that you havethe opportunity, turn the luffa on end and notice thethree chambers that run the length of the fruit. This isa standard feature of the squash family.

If you see a gourd growing on a tree, itis not a true gourd. It is probably the fruit of thecalabash tree (Crescentia cejute) a member of thefamily Bignoniaceae.

POISONOUS PLANTS9.1 - AN OVERVIEW' The toxic compounds that plants make areprobably, in many cases, a defense mechanismagainst being eaten. In other instances, we arenot quite certain.' Curiously enough, we knowingly or unknowinglyexperience the symptoms of toxicity from plantpoisons when we use plant-derived medicinesand psychoactive materials.' Many of our most valuable food plants comefrom plant families that are notorious for theirtoxicity, such as the carrot family, mustardfamily, and nightshade family.' A poisonous plant is not necessarily a lethal one.' There are many factors that influence the toxiceffects that a plant will have on its victim.' Many cases of plant poisonings are accidents,often involving misidentification.' Not all cases of poisoning are accidental. We alsoemploy toxic plants in purposeful ways, in theform of arrow, fish, insect, rat, and ordealpoisons. This will be the focus of our look at toxicplants.' The abuse of two toxic plant products, alcoholand tobacco, are leading causes of death in theUnited States.9.2 ! INTRODUCTION\u201cWhat is food to one, is to others bitter poison.\u201d[Lucretius, 99-55 BCE]\u201cUnfortunately, the illustrations of edible andpoisonous mushrooms were reversed on page 14 ofthe Sunday edition.\u201d [Chicago Tribune]\"... there are few more excruciating ways of expiringthan to eat a misidentification.\"  [R. S. Cowan, an American botanist]' ' ' ' 'A DEFINITIONA poisonous plant is one capable of disrupting thenormal functioning or state of health of its victim -- aperson, a wild or domesticated animal, or evenanother plant. Some toxic plants are lethal. Most ofthe several hundred that occur in North America arenot. What makes a plant poisonous? The majority ofthem are toxic because they manufacture one or morepoisonous substances. They are called toxicprinciples or poisonous principles. Some plants donot make a poison, but instead they absorb oraccumulate a toxic principle from the environment.The locoweed weeds, for instance, do not manufacturethe selenium found in their tissues. They absorb itfrom the soil in which they grow.RELATIVE TOXICITYThe amount of toxin required to kill a test animal maybe amazingly small. It is typically expressed in termsof an amount of toxin per weight of the victim. Thefigures below show the MLD (minimum lethal dose) inmicrograms (1 million micrograms = 1 gram) of toxinper kilogram of subject. The poison is administered byinjection. Notice that such well known poisons assodium cyanide and strychnine are relatively crude.TOXICITY OF SELECTED POISONSToxin (source) MLD in micrograms/kilogramNicotine (tobacco) 50,000Ouabain (arrow poison) 14,000Sodium cyanide 10,000Amanitin (mushroom toxin) 1,100Strychnine 500Curare (arrow poison) 500BWSP-toxin (black widow spider) 100Tetradotoxin (puffer fish) 8-20Rattlesnake toxin 0.2Ricin (castor bean toxin) 0.02Tetanus toxin 0.0001Botulinus toxin A 0.00003FACTORS INFLUENCINGTOXICITYA number of factors influence the severity of plantpoisonings. They include:' the kind of toxin produced;' the quantity of material ingested or contacted;' the part of the plant eaten and its condition;' the time of year;' environmental conditions, such as drought orfrost;' the kind of animal, its age, sex, and generalhealth;' personal sensitivities, allergic systems, and' even the genetic background of the victim.HOW DOES POISONING OCCUR?People fall prey to poisonous plants in a variety ofways:' curiosity, especially in children;' mistaking a toxic plant for an edible one;' using toxic plant parts in jewelry or as toys;' sucking nectar from flowers;' using leaves for teas;-155-' misuse of herbal or medicinal preparations;' abuse of recreational drug plants, such as thejimson weed; and' direct or indirect contact with toxic plants whencamping, weeding the garden, backpacking, orplaying.A few simple precautions will help lessen the chancesof poisoning. Know the common toxic plants of yourarea, including the ornamentals. Keep pets, infants,and small children away from attractive (especiallybrightly-colored) ornamentals and seeds. Store bulbs,seeds, and rootstocks away from children.SOME COMMONMISCONCEPTIONSOn the other hand, you can get yourself into a passelof trouble by accepting some widely held beliefs thatare without any foundation.' Discoloration of a silver spoon or coin is not areliable way of telling a mushroom from atoadstool.' Poisonous plants do not come color-coded. Not allred fruits are poisonous; not all blue ones aresafe.' Toxic plants do not always have bitter,disagreeable tastes; some are quite pleasant.' You cannot use the eating habits of birds or wildanimals as a reliable guide; birds are quite fond ofbrightly-colored \"fruits\" of the yew trees, whichwill kill us within minutes.' While cooking will destroy some toxic principles,others are not heat sensitive.SYMPTOMS OF PLANTPOISONINGSymptoms of plant poisoning in humans are manifoldand may present themselves in a variety of areas onand in our bodies. They include:' itching, redness, stinging, burning, blistering ofthe skin;' tingling, numbness, burning, swelling of the lips,mouth, tongue, or throat;' sweating, salivation, and tears;' nausea, retching, and vomiting;' stomach/abdominal pains, diarrhea, orconstipation;' changes in pulse rate and blood pressure;' headache, dizziness, faintness, and weakness;' difficulty in breathing, speaking, or seeing;' change in pupil size;' lack of muscular coordination, trembling, orparalysis;' convulsions or epileptic-like seizures;' changes in mental state (nervousness, giddiness,depressions, or signs of hallucinations;' sleepiness, coma, and' death.TREATMENTIt may come as a surprise to learn that there are noeffective antidotes for most of the poisons found inplants. Treatment usually consists of providingsymptomatic relief -- treating the effects of thepoisons, as opposed to neutralizing or destroying thetoxin. What can be done in cases of plant poisoning?' Make the victim vomit, if he or she is conscious.' Keep the victim warm and quiet, while observingclosely.' Call a physician or take the victim to a hospital.' Be ready to identify the plant or bring some of itwith you. Plant material in vomitus or stools mayalso be useful in identification.A word of caution. You and I are not medical doctors.We cannot legally tell a victim that he or she shouldfollow a particular \u201ccure.\u201d9.3 ! SURVEY OF PLANTSThere are roughly 30,000 native, naturalized, andornamental higher plants in North America; but onlya few hundred of them are toxic. Perhaps thirty orforty species are known to cause serious instances ofpoisoning or fatalities. One of them, tobacco[Nicotiana tabacum] is far and away the mostdangerous toxic plant encountered by most of us inmodern society. Its use leads to the death of severalhundred thousand people each year in this countryand to billions of dollars in health care expenses andlost productivity. It seldom receives the attention thatit should in discussions of toxic plants, probablybecause it is a legal drug plant whose use has beenwidely accepted and it is the source of tax revenue.EXPOSURES IN U.

P. & T. D. Jacobsen. 1997. Plantexposures... A national profile of the most common plantgenera. Vet. Human Toxicol. 39(4): 248, 249.In the descriptions that follow, I have selected plantsthat are poisonous to humans or animals. Most ofthem are well known to the general public; one or twowere included to demonstrate particular aspects oftoxicity.POISON-OAK AND POISON-IVYIn many ways, it is convenient to treat poison-oak andpoison-ivy as though they were one plant. They arevery closely related structurally, chemically, andgenetically. Western poison-oak (Toxicodendrondiversilobum) and eastern poison-ivy (T. radicans)account for most of the million or so cases ofdermatitis reported in the United States each yearbecause most of us do not recognize these plants inthe field and unknowingly come into direct or indirectcontact with them. The plants may grow as low,much-branched shrubs or they may be robust anderect. They may climb trees by means of aerialrootlets that fasten them to the trunk. The shape ofthe three leaflets is variable. All parts of the plant, with the possible exception ofpollen grains, are potentially dangerous at any time ofthe year. Plants do not have to be in flower or in fruitbefore they can produce symptoms. The mainconstituent of the irritating oil in poison-oak andpoison-ivy is urushiol, a pale-yellow liquid. It is amixture of catechol derivatives. The vast majority ofus appear to be initially immune to urushiol, so thatour first encounter with these plants will not producedermatitis. However, this event does initiate a seriesof immunological changes that will render theindividual much more likely to present symptomswhen plants are touched on future occasions. Thatmay be as early as the second encounter. Some of usappear to have much higher threshold levels thatmust be reached before symptoms appear.Contrary to popular belief, poison-oak and poison-ivydo not give off mysterious vapors or rays that causerashes. Direct or indirect contact with plants isrequired. It is the indirect means that most of us tendto overlook. We gleefully chop down poison-oak orpoison-ivy and then carelessly put away the hoe,shovel, and rake. We handle the family pet that hasjust run through a patch of these plants. We stand inthe smoke of burning leaves and stems, not realizingthat the toxin may be carried in droplets in the smoke.The characteristic streaks of red and vesicles areindicative of points of contact with the plant. The signsof itching, burning, and redness are usually seenwithin a few hours to about five days after exposure,depending upon the sensitivity of the victim. In moresevere cases, open running sores may develop. Thefluid from these sores is lymph, not the toxin itself.Urushiol binds with the protein of the skin withinabout ten minutes, so that reinfection from the spreadof this lymph is most unlikely. What often passes forthe spreading of poison-oak or poison-ivy fromrunning sores is actually caused by reinfection fromplant material beneath the fingernails or contaminatedclothing. Reactions to urushiol in some individualsmay be so severe that hospitalization is required.There are many time-honored cures for poison-oakand poison-ivy. Most of them cannot withstand closescrutiny. One of the more popular is taking a hotshower with yellow soap immediately after exposure.This does little more than wash off excess toxin. Anancient preventative, supposedly practiced by NativeAmericans, calls for eating a small piece of poison-oakto bring about a natural immunity. One person whoattempted this procedure came down with a seriousinflammation of the mouth and of the anus. Most ofthe creams, lotions, and pills that are available over-the-counter provide only symptomatic relief; they donot cure. Those treatments requiring a physician'sprescription have had mixed results.What follows is taken from a handout for a class onpoisonous plants that I once taught. You might alsofind it helpful.' Poison-oak is not a type of oak, nor is poison-ivya type of ivy. Both are members of the genusToxicodendron of the cashew family(Anacardiaceae), which includes the pistachio,cashew, pepper tree, and the mango.' There is no poison-ivy in California, only thewestern poison-oak.' The toxic substance in poison-oak and poison-ivyis called urushiol, a complex of four catechols.' The toxin is present in all parts of the plant thatcontain resin canals.' The toxins are not contracted via mysteriousvapors or rays; direct or indirect contact isrequired.' Urushiol may be present in the smoke of burningplants, because it is trapped in dust or ash.-157-' The toxins may be spread by animals. Petting adog that has run through a patch of poison-oak orpoison ivy is a way of contracting it.' Toxins may be spread by articles of clothing. It ispossible to reinfect yourself by handling the sameitems you were wearing in the field.' The liquid that oozes from broken blisters islymph and does not contain the toxins.' Sensitivity is based upon reactions at the cellularlevel between the toxins and specialized whiteblood cells called T-lymphocytes.' Sensitivity gradually declines with time,regardless of continued exposure. A minority ofpersons over 60 are sensitive.' Usually one must be sensitized by an initialcontact before you will react by producingdermatitis from subsequent exposures.' The level of sensitivity to urushiol and relatedtoxins differs from person to person. Once youhave surpassed a threshold of sensitivity, you willmost likely alter that threshold. In someinstances, it appear that a severe case will heraldeven more serious ones; in others it appears thatit precludes future episodes.' Strong soap merely removes excess poison fromthe skin, but it will not remove any that hasalready reacted, because the toxins have becomechemically bound to the skin within minutes afterexposure.' Eating a leaf as a means of building a naturalimmunity to poison-oak or poison-ivy can be mostdangerous. The internal poisoning likely to occurcan be serious, even fatal.' There is no evidence to support the widespreadbelief that the American Indian (or any otherracial or ethnic group) is naturally immune tothese plants.' Medicines used on the skin do not cure theinflammation. They serve only to dry the blisters,to treat secondary infections, and to relieveitching.' Injections and over-the-counter remedies areuneven in their effectiveness. They can makematters worse. Their use during an acute attack ishazardous.' Corticosteroids are the only agents with ademonstrated ability to benefit dermatitis frompoison-oak and poison-ivy.' There is some evidence to suggest that in someinstances dermatitis from poison-oak andpoison-ivy may be psychosomatic in its origin.HORSE CHESTNUT OR BUCKEYEAesculus is a genus of shrubs and trees representedin North America by both native species and thoseintroduced as ornamentals because of their attractivefoliage and spikes of flowers. All parts of these plantsare potentially dangerous. Children are often thevictims of buckeye poisoning, perhaps because of thelarge, interesting seeds that must be sampled, orbecause children like to make teas. Cattle have alsobeen poisoned. The toxic principle is aesculin, a kindof glycoside. It causes incoordination, sluggishness,vomiting, diarrhea, dilated pupils, and may lead toparalysis and death.Native Americans realized the toxic properties of theCalifornia buckeye [Ae. californica]. They used theseeds and other plant parts to stupefy fish. Also, aftercareful leaching, the seeds were ground up and eaten.LARKSPUR OR STAGGERWEEDDuring the spring and summer months, plants of thegenus Delphinium are among our most attractive wildflowers. Many of them have been brought intocultivation. But, the larkspurs or staggerweeds, asthey are known to ranchers, are a leading cause ofcattle loss in the western United States. There aremany kinds of larkspur and they are difficult todistinguish from one another. Assume that all of themare toxic to one degree or another. When they are inflower, larkspurs are readily identified by the singlenectar spur. They are not so easily spotted in thevegetative state because they closely resemble plantsof the buttercup, mallow, and geranium families. Thisis unfortunate, since much of the poisoning occurs inthe early spring before plants come into flower.Several toxic alkaloids have been isolated fromlarkspurs, the most important being delphinine.Toxicity varies from one species to the next, with theage of the plant, with the part ingested, and with thekind and vigor of the animal involved. Symptoms arealso variable. Livestock suffer from falling, kicking,severe constipation, vomiting, bloating, and paralysisof the respiratory centers. Most cases of poisoninginvolve cattle that have been put out to pasture beforeit is ready, so that the animals have little to eat otherthan young larkspur plants.FALSE HELLEBOREVeratrum californicum, a native member of the lilyfamily, is found in mountain meadows, often on wettersites. The robust plants have broad leaves withprominent veins and branched clusters of dull whiteflowers. The toxic principles are alkaloids that mayoccur singly or in combination with other classes oftoxins. Poisoning in humans is rare and it involvesgastrointestinal distress with severe vomiting anddiarrhea. There is also impairment of motor functions.Cardiovascular involvement is typical, with theheartbeat being noticeably slowed.Toxicity in pregnant ewes is dramatic. If they feed onfalse hellebore, the effect of the veratrum alkaloidson embryological development is severe and leads toa malformation in lambs called \"monkey-face\" or\"cyclops.\" The face is shortened, the forehead and jawprotrude, the nose is reduced so that the face isflattened. In cycloptic animals, there may be a singlecentral eye, two eyeballs in the same socket, or twoeyes partially fused.OLEANDERNerium oleander, a Mediterranean shrub, is a favoriteornamental in many of the warmer parts of the UnitedStates, because of its attractive flowers andpenetrating fragrance. It was once believed that theheavy fumes were, in fact, toxic if allowed to-158-accumulate in a closed, poorly ventilated room. Whilethis particular story has no basis, oleander's generalreputation for toxicity is well-founded. Cattle andhumans have both been killed by this plant. Childrenhave been poisoned by eating the leaves and bysucking nectar from the flowers. Cases of poisoningfrom eating meat that had been skewered on oleanderstems are also in the literature.All parts of the plant are poisonous. Several cardiacglycosides are present. Symptoms of toxicity inhumans include dizziness, drowsiness, irregular andweak heart-beat, coma, and death. Smoke fromburning plants is also dangerous.POISON HEMLOCKThe carrot family (Umbelliferae) is an excellentexample of a common and easily recognizable plantfamily that contains both toxic and edible plants. Mostof them vaguely look like, smell like, and even tastelike carrots. The species are difficult to tell from oneanother. Most of the botanical features reside inmicroscopic features of the fruits. It is mistakenidentity that leads most people to eat the poisonhemlock (Conium maculatum), thinking that it isperhaps a wild carrot of some sort. Plants are commonroadside weeds over much of the United States. Theyhave delicate, fern-like foliage and white flowerclusters. The best diagnostic feature is purpleblotching on the stems and leaf stalks.Poison hemlock contains a series of nicotine-likealkaloids, the best known of them being coniine.Alkaloid concentration is highest in the seeds andlowest in the roots. Their effect is on the centralnervous system. The victim experiences progressivedepression of vital functions. The tips of the fingersand toes become insensitive; movement of the armsand legs is then impaired. They are finally paralyzed.The heart is weakened and slowed. Death comes asthe result of paralysis of the diaphragm andsubsequent respiratory failure.Circumstantial evidence suggests that one of poisonhemlock's most famous victims was Socrates. Thereremains some uncertainty as to the identity of thehemlock used in ancient Greece to dispatch enemiesof the state, but the symptoms reported by Plato inPhaedo are consistent with much of what we knowabout the plant. \u201cThe boy went out, and after spending a long time,came in with the man who was to give the poisoncarrying it ground ready in a cup. Socrates caughtsight of the man and said, \u2018Here, my good man, youknow about these things; what must I do?\u2018Just drink it,\u2019 he said, \u2018and walk about till your legsget heavy, then lie down. In that way the drug will actof itself.\u2019... he put the cup to his lips and, quite easy andcontented, drank it up.He walked about, and when he said that his legs werefeeling heavy, he lay down on his back, as the mantold him to do; at the same time the one who gavehim the potion felt him, and after a while examinedhis feet and legs; then pinching a foot hard, he askedif he felt anything; he said no.After this, again, he pressed the shins; and, movingup like this, he showed us that he was growing coldand stiff. Again, he felt him, and told us that when itcame to his heart, he would be gone. Already the coldhad come nearly as far as the abdomen, whenSocrates threw off the covering from his face \u2013 for hehad covered it over \u2013 and said, the last words uttered,\u2018Criton,\u2019 he said, \u2018we owe a cock to Asclepios; pay itwithout fail.\u2019... after a little time, he stirred, and the manuncovered him, and his eyes were still. Criton, seeingthis, closed the mouth and eyelids.This was the end of our comrade...\u201d[Phaedo, Plato]It has been suggested, however, that Plato knowinglyomitted some of the more unpleasant aspects of whatoccurred in an attempt to make the death of Socratesseem more dignified and heroic.WATER HEMLOCKIf we had to select the most violently poisonous plantin North America, it would probably be water hemlock.The various species of Cicuta occur over much of thecontinent. Their most unmistakable diagnostic featureis found in the root-like stems, at or below the surfaceof the ground. When cut lengthwise, the rootstocksreveal cross-partitioning that divides them into smallcompartments. This is the most toxic part of the plant.One rootstock is sufficient to kill any large animal,including humans.The toxic principle is cicutoxin, an unsaturatedalcohol. It is a violent convulsant to the centralnervous system. Symptoms appear within 15 minutesto one hour after ingestion. At first, there is excessivesalivation, followed by tremors and convulsions. Theseizures alternate with periods of relaxation. Thetetanic convulsions become more frequent and moreviolent. In many victims there is an uncontrollablechewing movement that makes it difficult toadminister treatment. The tongue may be shreddedand teeth forced from their sockets. The poisoning isso traumatic in humans, that survivors often have norecollection of the event.Here is perhaps the earliest account in English ofwater hemlock poisoning.\u201cWhen about the end of March, 1670, the cattle werebeing led from the village to water at the spring, intreading the river banks they exposed the roots of thisCicuta [water hemlock], whose stems and leaf budswere now coming forth. A that time two boys and sixgirls, a little before noon, ran out of the spring and themeadow through which the river flows, and seeing aroot and thinking that it was a golden parsnip, notthrough the bidding of any evil appetite, but at thebehest of wayward frolicsomeness, ate greedily of it,and certain of the girls among them commended theroot to the others for its sweetness and pleasantness,wherefore the boys, especially, ate quite abundantlyof it and joyfully hastened home; and one the girlstearfully complained to her mother that she had beensupplied too meagerly by her comrades, with the root.Jacob Maeder, a boy of six years, possessed of whitelocks, and delicate though active, returned homehappy and smiling, as if things had gone well. A littlewhile afterwards he complained of pain in hisabdomen, and scarcely uttering a word, fell prostrateon the ground, and urinated with great violence to the-159-heighth of a man. Presently he was a terrible sight tosee, being seized with convulsions, with the loss of allhis senses. His mouth was shut most tightly so that itcould not be opened by any means. He grated histeeth; he twisted his eyes about strangely and bloodflowed from his ears.... He frequently hiccupped; attimes he seemed to be about to vomit, but he couldforce nothing from his mouth, which was most tightlyclosed. He tossed his limbs about marvelously andtwisted them; frequently his head was drawnbackward and his whole back was curved in the forma bow, so that a small child could have crept beneathhim the space between his back and the bed withouttouching him.When the convulsions ceased momentarily, heimplored the assistance of his mother. Presently,when they returned with equal violence, he could bearoused by no pinching, by not talking, or by no othermeans, until his strength failed and he grew pale; andwhen a hand was placed on his breast he breathed hislast.These symptoms continued scarcely beyond a halfhour. After his death, his abdomen and face swelledwithout lividness except that a little was noticeableabout the eyes. From the mouth of the corpse even tothe hour of his burial green froth flowed veryabundantly, and although it was wiped awayfrequently by his grieving father, nevertheless newfroth soon took its place.DUMBCANEThis popular ornamental (Dieffenbachia picta), nativeto the American tropics, may well be the most toxicmember of the philodendron or aroid family(Araceae). The traditional explanation of toxicity inthis group is relatively straightforward -- microscopic,needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate (raphides)become imbedded in the soft tissues of the mouth andthroat. The result is an intense burning sensation,abundant salivation, and a swelling of the lips, tongue,and mouth. There may be impairment of breathingand swallowing. Speech may become unintelligible orlost; hence the common name of the plant. There mayalso be corrosive effects on the esophagus andstomach. Sap can be very irritating to the eyes, aswell.In recent years, the role calcium oxalate in dumbcanetoxicity has been increasingly questioned. One recentstudy suggests that the raphides do not play a majorrole in the toxic effects of Dieffenbachia. Variousresearchers have implicated a proteolytic enzyme,histamines, and kinins.MISTLETOEMistletoes are parasitic shrubs that live on woodyplants, especially oaks. The European mistletoe[Viscum spp.] has a long history of medicinal uses,including to induce abortions. It is known in NorthAmerica only from introductions in California. TheAmerican mistletoe [Phoradendron spp.] has enjoyeda reputation for being highly poisonous, with only oneor two berries or leaves supposedly being fatal.Extracts from it have been used in herbal teas and itsleaves and berries incorporated into Christmasdecorations.Recent studies demonstrate that mistletoe toxicity hasbeen overstated. Ingestion of 1 to 3 berries or leavesappears unlikely to produce adverse reactions.However, herbal tea preparations do put a person atrisk and symptoms of poisoning may be severe.POINSETTIAEuphorbia pulcherrima, the poinsettia, is named afterJoel Poinsett, an American ambassador to Mexico inthe 19th  century. It is one of this country's mostpopular ornamentals. Because literally millions ofthem are raised each year, especially at the Christmasseason, the question arises as to the plant's toxicity.It is widely held that the milky latex in the plant cancause irritation to the eyes and blistering of the skin.Ingestion of any portion is commonly thought toproduce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, loss ofconsciousness, and even death. As with mistletoe, it now appears that the poisonousproperties of the poinsettia have been exaggerated.While many standard references on toxic plants havemore or less the same litany of deleterious effects,documentation has been meager. The only fatalitycited appears to be that of a two-year-old child inHawaii who died in 1919 after eating a single leaf. Thecase is now considered hearsay. Recent studiessuggest that the latex has a mildly irritating effect onthe skin of laboratory rabbits and that it also inducesphotosensitivity. Rats fed 25 gm/kg body weight of apoinsettia suspension showed no significant toxiceffects. Assuming a 50 lb child would react similarly,he or she would have to consume 500-600 leaves tosurpass that experimental dose.ERGOTI want to end this survey of toxic plants with the ergotfungus because it provides such a fine example of aplant that is toxic, one that has important medicinaluses, and is also well known for its psychoactiveproperties. The focus in this section will be on itspoisonous aspect. For thousands of years we havesuffered from a debilitating disease known as St.Antony's Fire or Ignis Sacre. Its victims werehorribly disfigured because of the loss of ears,portions of the nose, fingers, toes, hands, feet, oreven the lower portions of arms and legs.Domesticated animals were similarly poisoned. Forcenturies the cause was assumed to be evil spirits oreven God's punishment for wickedness.We now know that these symptoms are caused byalkaloids produced by the ergot fungus (Clavicepspurpurea and other species). Poisoning occurs whenwe consume contaminated food, often bread madefrom a cereal host of the fungus. The alkaloids causeconstriction of blood vessels, leading to the death oftissue and loss of body parts. Extremities of the bodyare the most likely targets because they are mostdistant from the heart. This syndrome of poisoning,known as chronic ergotism, occurs when the victimconsumes relatively small amounts of the ergotalkaloids over a long period of time. If the local milleris really sloppy and large doses of toxin enter thebody, the effect is not on the circulatory system, buton the central nervous system. The result isconvulsive ergotism, which produces a syndrome ofbizarre behavior that mimics mental illness. I will tellyou more about that subject when we get to medicinalplants.-160-POISONOUS PLANTS OF NORTH AMERICAScientific Name [Common Name] Toxic Part Toxic Principle.

PURPOSEFUL USE OFTOXIC PLANTS\"We did not escape without damage because [theIndians] killed another companion of ours ... and intruth, the arrow did not penetrate half a finger, but asit had poison on it, he gave up his soul to our Lord.\"(Francisco de Orellana, 1541)We have knowingly used poisonous plants asinstruments of punishment, torture,  murder, andsuicide. As interesting as some of these episodesmight be, they are not the subject of this section. Iwant to concentrate instead on our use of plant toxinsin arrow poisons, in the little-known ritual known asthe \"ordeal,\" and on their use to kill fish, insects, androdents.ARROW & DART POISONSPeoples of both the Old World and the New Worldhave used many different plants in the preparation ofthese poisons. Native Americans on this continentused relatively few arrow poisons from plant sources,relying instead on rattlesnake venom and the juices ofthe black widow spider. The Indians of South Americaand the tribesmen of Africa used arrow poisons bothto hunt wild game and in wars against their enemies.CURARE. This is probably the most famous arrowpoison. The name is a phonetic rendering of an Indianphrase meaning, \"He, to whom it comes, falls.\" Otherspellings used in the literature are urari, woorari,woorali, and wourali. Curare is the name for a wholegroup of arrow poisons used in South America. Thefact that the ingredients and their relative proportionsvary from one location to the next hindered any realunderstanding of the botanical and chemical nature ofthe poison.The Baron Alexander von Humboldt was probably thefirst European to witness the preparation of curare. Hewrote that the Indians shredded bark of certain treesand made an infusion from it. This was furtherconcentrated by boiling it. Several other plantmaterials were added to the mixture.The Indians have several different ways of assayingthe strength of curare. One is to wound a frog with apoisoned arrow or dart. If it can jump more than eighttimes without the curare taking effect, then the potionis deemed too weak. Another test involves a monkeyjumping from tree to tree. When the curare is at itsproper strength, an animal should not be able to jumpto more than one tree before the toxin takes effect.And, a final test is that since the honor of preparingcurare often falls to the old women of the tribe, if theyare not half intoxicated by the fumes of the boilingmixture, the brew is not yet ready.The exact botanical nature of curare is still in somedoubt. The two principal toxic ingredients areStrychnos spp. (often S. toxifera) of the Logan-iaceaeand Chondrodendron tomentosum of the moonseedfamily (Menispermaceae).Three basic groups or kinds of curare are oftenrecognized, based upon the physical form in whichthey are prepared. Tubocurare, also known as tubecurare or bamboo curare, is cylindrical, having beenpacked in hollow bamboo stems. The two other kindsare gourd or calabash curare and pot  curare.Chondrodendron is the principal ingredient in tubecurare; it is also used in pot curare. Strychnos is usedin both calabash and pot curare.The active ingredient is d-tubocurarine chloride ortubocurarine chloride, a whitish, odorless powder.Poisoning manifests itself in muscular relaxation byblocking of impulses between the nerve and themuscle fiber activated by it. Symptoms include:' impaired vision' bilateral drooping of lips' heaviness of face' relaxation of jaw' weakness of head muscles' inability to raise head' paralysis of spinal muscles, legs, & arms' slowed respiration, and' death.Curare is rapidly destroyed and excreted. Its actionusually lasts for about 15-20 minutes, during whichthe victim dies. The flesh of animals killed by curaremay be eaten.There are also medicinal uses for curare. Because it isa muscle relaxant, it may be used in the treatment ofconvulsive mental patients and in certain types ofsurgery. Curare is also used to diagnose myastheniagravis, a muscular disorder characterized by an overalldeterioration of muscle tone.KOMBI. The action of this African arrow poison wasfirst described in detail by Dr. David Livingstone, themissionary to Africa of \u201cDr. Livingstone, I presume\u201dfame. He observed people preparing a poison from thefruits of Strophanthus, a member of Apocynaceae, thedogbane family. The action of kombi is much like thatof curare. The wounded animal rarely runs more thanabout a hundred yards before it falls. Kombi containsstrophanthin, a glycoside with digitalis-like effects. Itmust get into the blood stream, which means that theflesh of kombi victims is edible.Strophanthin also finds limited uses in medicine. It isused on heart attack victims when time is of theutmost importance. It takes effect much faster thandigitalis, but it is such a violent poison that thedosages must be carefully controlled.UPAS. This is an arrow poison used by the natives ofJava. The chief ingredient is Antiaris toxicaria ofMoraceae, the mulberry family.OUABAIN. The natives of tropical Africa prepare anarrow poison from Strophanthus gratus. A somewhatinferior brand can be made from Acokantheraschimperi and A. deflexa. Ouabain is the most rapidlyacting heart-glycoside known.-172-NEW WORLD ARROW & DART POISONSScientific Name (Family) Area of UseAconitum spp. (Buttercup) North AmericaAnemone spp. (Buttercup) North AmericaAnomospermum spp. (Moonseed) South AmericaCapsicum annuum (Nightshade) South AmericaCocculus spp. (Moonseed) South AmericaColliguaja odorifera (Spurge) South AmericaChondrodendron spp. (Moonseed) South AmericaConium maculatum (Parsley) North AmericaCynanchum macrophyllum (Milkweed) N.

The technique is notcomplex. It typically involves putting the required partof a particular plant in a still body of water. The planttoxin is released into the water, numbing the fish sothat it comes floating to the surface.The California buckeye (Aesculus californica) was usedby several tribes of Native Americans. Seeds,sometimes leaves or young stems, were crushed andmade into a mash that was floated on the surface ofthe water. The stupefied fish were then gathered byhand or in nets. The fish poison tree (Piscidia piscipula) of the beanfamily occurs in Texas, Florida, Mexico, the WestIndies, and South America. Its leaves, stems, and rootbark are macerated with a rum distillation residue orlime water. The material is then placed in baskets andfloated in the water until the stupefied fish surface.The plant contains piscidin, a mixture of two toxicglycosides.FISH POISONSScientific & Common Name Where Used ?Aesculus californica (California buckeye) CaliforniaChlorogalum pomeridianum (soaproot) CaliforniaClibadium spp. (Cunambi) AmazonConium maculatum (wasia) MexicoCroton setigerus (turkey mullein) CaliforniaDerris elliptica (tuba-root) AsiaEchinocystis fabacea (manroot) CaliforniaErythrina piscipula South AmericaHura crepitans (oassuc\u00fa) South AmericaLomatium dissectum CaliforniaLonchocarpus spp. (barbasco) Tropical AmericaLycopus spp. (horehound) CaliforniaManihot esculenta (cassava) GuianaPatinoa sphaerocarpa AmazonPaullinia spp. (timb\u00f3) South AmericaPhyllanthus spp. South AmericaSapindus saponarius (amolli) MexicoSerjania spp. (timb\u00f3) South AmericaSmilacina sessilifolia (Solomon seal) CaliforniaTephrosia piscatoria South AmericaThevetia peruviana (jorro-jorro) BrazilTrichstema lanceolatum (blue curls) CaliforniaUmbellularia californica (pepperwood) CaliforniaWikstroemia spp. Hawai'iINSECTICIDESIn addition to the more exotic arrow and ordealpoisons, the plant kingdom yields useful poisons forthe control of insects. About 1200 different specieshave been used in this context, although onlyrotenone, pyrethrum, and nicotine are of any realcommercial value. One of these, rotenone, was usedfor centuries as a fish poison in South America beforeits use as an insecticide.Rotenone is a very popular insecticide derived fromthe roots of Derris and Lonchocarpus, both membersof the bean family. The former is native to the OldWorld tropics, while the latter is New World in itsdistribution. Rotenone was first isolated from Derris in1902. It is a colorless, crystalline compound extractedfrom the dried roots. Rotenone is insoluble in water,but soluble in oil. It is about fifteen times more toxicthan nicotine. The toxic principle has no effect onwarm blooded animals. Rotenone was isolated fromthe roots of Lonchocarpus in 1926. Its roots are richerin the toxin than those of Derris.Pyrethrum is the name given to the dried flowerheads of three species of Chrysanthemum. They yieldvolatile oils that paralyze insects. This came as nosurprise to horticulturists who knew that these plantswere rarely attacked by insects. Depending upon thespecies, the pyrethrum is often called \"Dalmatianinsect powder,\" \"Caucasian insect powder,\" or\"Persian insect powder.\" Pyrethrum has been usedsuccessfully in the control of flies, fleas, malarialmosquitos, and body lice.INSECTICIDES FROM PLANTSScientific Name (Common Name) CommentAnabasis ioaphylla Used in Near EastAnnona cherimola (cherimoya)  Used against liceChrysanthemum cinerariifolium PyrethrumCroton texensis (croton) Used in New MexicoCymbopogon nardus (lemon grass) Citronella oilDelphinium spp. (larkspur) Seeds usedDerris spp. (tuba-root) Root source of rotenoneDolichos pseudopachyrrhizus Tropical Africa-173-Duboisia hopwoodii Leaves contain nornicotineEupatorium spp. (boneset) Eastern N.

Therefore, they are sometimes calledraticides. They are effective in small quantities, andappear to taste just fine.Squill or sea-onion (Drimia maritima) is aMediterranean member of the lily family. Since ancienttimes, its bulbs and extracts of the bulbs have beenused to kill rodents. If you or I eat this material, it willmake us sick and we will vomit, thereby ridding thesystem of the toxin. Rodents, on the other hand, haveno \u201cvomit control center\u201d in their brains so that anyplant parts consumed will remain in the stomach andbe absorbed. The sea-onion contains a series of toxinsthat affect the heart. They are called cardiacglycosides and they are chemically similar to thosefound in the foxglove plants. The sea-onion toxins,given by injection in moderation, have medicinal usesas diuretics, emetics, and expectorants.Sweet clover. One of the most pleasant smells ofrural areas is freshly mown pastures. Part of that nicearoma comes from sweet clovers (Melilotus spp.),herbs of the legume family. These plants also producea form of coumarin, which inhibits blood clotting.Given in controlled quantities, coumarins are effectiveas blood thinners. Some years ago, the WisconsinAlumni Research Foundation discovered that amodified form of coumarin made a very effective ratpoison. They named it Warfarin (after themselves).The poor little rats go off someplace and die frominternal hemorrhaging. ORDEAL POISONSThe lives of many peoples through the ages have beendominated by a complex pantheon of deities, bothgood and evil. In many societies, one very importantobligation was to placate friendly gods and not toencourage the evil ones. These were not societies thatwere protected by a single omnipotent god whorewarded good deeds and punished the wicked. Inmany societies, the people developed procedures fordetermining guilt and innocence. This was a trial or anordeal to which suspects were subjected. If innocent,the person would be able to pass the ordeal; but, ifguilty, he or she would fail.We have used similar devices in the United States andEurope. Consider the witch trials of the 17th century.A woman suspected of being a witch was bound,placed in a bag, and tossed in a lake. If she floated, itwas concluded that she was indeed a witch and shewas dispatched in some novel fashion. If the womansank to the bottom of the lake and drowned, hersurvivors had the consolation of knowing that she wasinnocent.Many of the African tribes employed plant poisons intheir own version of the ordeal. No one really knowshow the use of ordeal poisons began. One plausibleexplanation is that food gatherers mistakenly pickeda toxic plant, assuming it to be edible. The people ofthe village ate it; some were poisoned and died, whileothers lived. Given the philosophical and religiousclimate, a possible explanation that would come tomind is that those who ate the plant and died weresomehow connected with witchcraft or were guilty ofsome evil and were being punished.There are several different ways in which the ordealpoisons were employed. One of the moststraightforward involves a plant called the tanghin ofMadagascar (Cerbera spp.) All parts of this tree aretoxic, the fruits especially so. The toxin is a cardiacglycoside. The person undergoing the ordeal is givena drink of rice water or rice soup. He or she is thengiven three pieces of chicken skin to swallow withoutchewing, followed by the crushed tanghin fruits mixedwith banana juice and a preparation of cardamomleaves or juice. Incantations are performed. Theconcoction acts as an emetic, a substance that willcause vomiting. Failure to do so is an immediate signof guilt. The vomitus is carefully examined by tribalofficials to see if all three pieces of chicken skin arepresent. They must be if the suspect is to be judgedinnocent. If not, the other members of the tribe killthe person, knowing now that he or she is guilty. Thesignificance of the chicken skin lies in the belief thatan evil spirit inhabits the body of a guilty person andthat it would devour any flesh presented to it,including chicken skin. Before considering this to be aquaint custom, consider that in 1830 a series ofnatural disasters and diseases swept Madagascar. Thisprompted mass ordeal trials to determine who wascausing these calamities. As many as 6000 peopledied in one trial!Probably the most famous of the ordeal poisonsinvolves the Calabar bean (Physostigma vene-nosum), a vine of the legume family named after atown in Nigeria. It has a long history of use in Africaas a means of identifying and killing witches. The trialconsisted of the accused drinking water that containedeight smashed Calabar beans. If the personregurgitated the beans or raised his right arm andsurvived, then he was judged innocent. The fast-acting toxin, physostigmine, rarely pro-duced thatresult.In recent years this plant has been the object ofmedical research. This same toxin is now used to treatglaucoma, chronic constipation, and aspects ofAlzheimer\u2019s disease.The \"Mauvi tree\" of East Africa is used by the nativesof the Lake Nyassa region. The bark is mixed withother substances and given to the suspects. If you areguilty, you will vomit and die. There is a certainsimplicity to it. The body of the guilty party is spiritedaway by relatives who will cremate the remains, grindup the bones, and put the powder on their faces.In some instances, the suspects at an ordeal will beasked to perform some task. Inability to do so is takenas a sign of guilt. In one tribe, the medicine mandraws a line on the ground about ten feet in front ofthe suspects. If you can walk across the line, you areinnocent. In another tribe, the suspect is asked to-174-jump over a stick held about 50 cm above the ground.One tribe that occupied what used to be called theIvory Coast in Africa used the white latex from amember of the spurge family. A latex-soaked piece ofcotton was placed under the eyelid and allowed toremain there for a required period. Damage to thecornea was taken as evidence of guilt.Many of the ordeal poisons were simple preparationsinvolving a toxic plant and one or two otheringredients. Some were complex preparation of aplant poison, lizards, crushed snakes, toads, heartsfrom previous victims, miscellaneous human organs,blood, and bile. The various ingredients were thenfermented for one year to bring them up to properstrength.The belief in the accuracy of the ordeal poisons was sopowerful that perfectly innocent people who weresubjected to the ritual would confess to the mosthorrible crimes if they felt the toxin taking effect. Aswith so many useful social institutions, corruptionsoon tainted the ordeal rituals. The priests and witchdoctors found that they could guarantee the outcomeof an ordeal by careful preparation of the poisons.Their friends received weak doses; their enemiesseldom survived. The witch doctor would make aconspicuous display of drinking a weak dose of theordeal poison before a large crowd to strengthen hisposition in the community and to show that theinnocent had nothing to fear.

As a general termused in botany, an herb is a non-woody plant. In thekitchen, an herb is a plant or plant part, such as dill ororegano, used to flavor food. What we are about toexamine are the medicinal herbs. Here the term, asdefined by Varro Tyler (1994)  means \"... crude drugsof vegetable origin utilized for the treatment ofdisease states, often of a chronic nature, or to attainor maintain a condition of improved health.\" HISTORYA BRIEF HISTORY OF MEDICINE (SORT OF)BCE:2000 Here, eat this root!CE:1000 That root is heathen.

Here, eat this root!(After Nature: 21 October 2004)Perhaps no other aspect of economic botany is morefascinating than the study of medicinal plants. Wehave turned again and again to plants as sources ofmedicines to cure our diseases and disorders. In noother phase of ethnobotany do we find such a strangemixture of fact and fiction, sound medicine andfanciful tale.Anthropological and archeological studies suggest thatwe have been using plants for medicinal purposes forabout 60,000 years. This date is tied to fossilized plantremains at a Neanderthal grave site unearthed in Iran.Buried with the individual were yarrow, hollyhock,groundsel, grape-hyacinth, St. Barneby's thistle, andjoint-fir (Ephedra).Ancient texts reveal to us the materia medica, thebody of medical knowledge, possessed by variouscivilizations. Some of the more important ones are:Pen Tsao Ching, written by the Emperor Shen Nungin about 2700 BC, lists 365 drugs used in ancientChina.Code of Hammurabi, the Babylonian legal code ofabout 1770 BC, lists cassia, henbane, licorice, andmints.Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian text from 1500 BC lists700 drug plants and 876 formulas in use at the time.This 67 ft. long document was discovered by GeorgEbers in 1874 near Luxor. The papyrus cites hemp,opium, frankincense, myrrh, aloe, juniper, linseed,castor oil, fennel, cassia, senna, thyme, and henna.-176-De Materia Medica was written about AD 78 by theGreek physician Pedianos Dioskurides, better knownto us now as Dioscorides. It lists the medicinal uses of600 plants, including opium, ergot, black nightshade,and cinnamon. An illustrated version, the CodexJuliana, appeared in AD 512. De Materia Medicaremained an authoritative reference for 19 centuries!Physica is the only ancient herbal that I know ofwritten by a woman, Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179). It is also the first book on natural history donein Germany. Hildegard established a convent atRupertsberg and served there as Abbess until herdeath. She said that God had commanded her to writeher herbal.THE AGE OF HERBALS (1470 to 1670)An herbal is a compilation of plants used in a medicalcontext. Some had few, if any illustrations.

Acompilation of Aztec materia medica, it was the firstherbal of the New World. The only surviving copy wasdiscovered in the 1940's in the Vatican Library, whereit had been lost for more than four centuries. It listedabout 200 plants, along with an illustration and howthe plant was used. Pen Tsao Kang Mu was written in 1590 by Li Shih.This 52 volume catalogue of medicinal herbs contains1094 plants and about 11,000 recipes.The English Physician and Complete Herbal,published by Nicholas Culpeper in 1653, iscontaminated by his beliefs in astrology and alchemy.It remains popular even to this day, having gonethrough more than 100 editions.Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae (1615) waswritten by Francisco Hernandez (1514-1587),physician to King Philip II of Spain. It first appeared as16 folio volumes. An illustrated edition was publishedin 1651.New Herball was written by William Turner (1510-1568). Part 1 appeared in 1551; Pt. 2 in 1562.Paradisi in Sole Paradisus Terrestris (1629) waswritten by John Parkinson (1567-1650), apothecary toKing James I of England.Theatrum Botanicum: the Theater of Plantes, oran Universall and Compleate Herball (1640) wasthe other major contribution made by John Parkinson.The Herbal or Generall Historie of Plantes (1597)by John Gerard is perhaps the most monumentalclassical herbal in the English language. There may bemore printed copies in circulation today than when itappeared four centuries ago. Gerard was a member ofthe Barber-Surgeon's Company in London. Much ofwhat we find in the Herbal was taken from HenryLyte's translation of another herbal written byRembert Dodoens.The Compleat Herbal was written by Joseph Pittonde Tournefort (1656-1708). It was a translation andexpansion of his earlier work \u201cEl\u00e9mens de Botanique\u201d(1694). The work appeared in two volumes, dated1719 and 1730.Herbarum Vivae Eicones by Otto Brunfels is a threevolume work that was the first to base its illustrationson living plants. Seventy-seven of the originalwatercolor paintings by Hans Weiditz were found inthe attic of the Bern Botanical Institute in 1930.Charles Singer (1927) noted that, \"Most herbalremedies are quite devoid of any rational basis. It maybe taken for granted that the writer of the herbal isunable to treat evidence on a scientific basis.\"THE DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURESIt was particularly during the Age of the Herbals thatthe Doctrine of Signatures became a popular belief. Ifthe idea had a special champion, it was the Swissphysician and alchemist Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus(born Theophrastus Bom-bastus von Hohenheim). Theconcept is captured in the following quotes:\"Though sin and Satan have plunged mankind into anocean of infirmities, yet the mercy of God which isover all His works has made the grass to grow uponthe mountains and herbs for the use of man and Hehas not only stamped upon these a distinct form, butalso has given them particular signatures wherebymen may read, even in legible characters, the use ofthem.\" (Nicolas Culpeper. English Physician, 1680)\"God [has] imprinted upon Plants, Herbs, and Flowers,as if it were in Hieroglyphics, the very signatures oftheir vertues.\" (William Turner, in an herbal dedicatedto Queen Elizabeth I).In other words, the very shape of a plant or portion ofa plant gives us a sign as to how it can be used totreat our medical problems. If a plant has a heart--177-shaped leaf, it is a sign that it is good for the heart; aplant with a scorpion-shaped flower cluster is effectivein the treatment of scorpion bites. Kidney beansshould be good for the kidneys and walnuts ought tomake us smarter. Such nonsense persists today.MORE RECENT DEVELOPMENTSUntil the early part of this century, the practicingphysician derived most of his standard cures from theplant kingdom. Medical botany was a required coursein a physician's formal training. The intimaterelationship between medicine and botany yielded aninteresting side effect. Many of our outstandingbotanists, including Linnaeus Himself, were trained inmedicine. A number of them gave up their medicalpractices to go into botany full-time.The use of drugs of botanical origin began to declineas they were replaced by synthetic substitutes. In1820, 82% of the drugs listed in the NationalFormulary were from plants. In 1946, only 38% wereof plant origin; 56% were chemical; and 6% animal.Today the plant kingdom is once again a major sourceof interest to both the major drug houses and the U.S.government. Large screening programs are underwayto test thousands of species for their ability to controlcancer and leukemia. Other programs areinvestigating plants, such as the yams of Mexico, thatmanufacture the chemical components that are vitalto the biosynthesis of steroidal hormones. Several arebeing looked at as useful in the treatment of AIDS.The shelves of our local bookstores and articles in thepopular press provide strong evidence of a renewedinterest in herbal remedies. A number of reasons havebeen suggested, including dissatisfaction with modernhealth care systems, the costs of commercial drugs,and returning to a more natural way of treating ourillnesses. A recent study cited in Brevoort (1994)showed that about half of the people who purchasemedicinal herbs use them every day, 70% buy themregularly, and about a third of people have been usingherbs for 15 years or more. Regular users of medicinalherbs spend about $30 per month on them.Herbal remedies constitute a major industry in thiscountry. The following data are from Blumenthal(2001). Total retail sales declined about 15% over theprevious year. Of the top ten herbs shown below, onlysoy and valerian sales were up.IRRATIONAL HERBALISMThe late Varro Tyler, one of our most respectedexperts on the use of medicinal herbs, offered somewords of caution. He suggests that if we accept any ofthe following precepts, then we have adoptedirrational beliefs about herbal medicine.' A conspiracy by the medical establishmentdiscourages the use of herbs.' Herbs cannot harm, only cure.' Whole herbs are more effective than their isolatedactive constituents.' \"Natural\" and \"organic\" herbs are superior tosynthetic drugs.' The Doctrine of Signatures is meaningful.' Reducing the dose of a medicine increases itstherapeutic activity.' Astrological influences are significant.' Physiological tests in animals are not applicable tohuman beings.' Anecdotal evidence is highly significant.' Herbs were created by God specifically to curedisease.TERMS USED IN HERBAL MEDICINEastringent: an agent, often rich in tannins, that precipitates proteins and thereby leads to thecontraction of tissues and the checking of bleeding;bitter: an agent that aids in digestion by promoting salivation and the secretion of stomach acids anddigestive enzymes;carminative: an agent that soothes the digestive system by relieving gas, spasms, and distention;cathartic: an agent with a laxative effect, thereby causing an evacuation of the bowels;demulcent: an agent, often mucilaginous, that soothes irritated or inflamed tissues, especiallymucous membranes;diaphoretic: an agent that promotes perspiration;emmenegogue: an agent that stimulates menstrualflow;emollient: an agent that softens or smooths the skin;febrifuge: an agent that lowers fever;galactagogue: an agent that promotes the flow of milk;nervine: an agent stimulates or depresses thenervous system;purgative: an agent with strong laxative effectstomachic: an agent that supports gastric functionsand promotes appetite;tonic: an agent that invigorates specific organ(s) oran entire individual;vulnerary: an agent that supports the healing of wounds[After Boon & Smith, 1999]10.3 ! SURVEY OFMEDICINAL PLANTSThere are literally hundreds of plants with medicinalproperties, well-documented and otherwise. Many ofthem have been officially recognized by governmentsand medical associations for approved use byphysicians. Many more reside in the realm of \u201cherbal-178-remedies\u201d with varying degrees of demonstratedeffectiveness.MANDRAKEMandrake (Mandragora officinarum) is not really amedicinal plant. I have included it because of its longhistory in folk medicine and its bizarre reputation.From the beginning it has been considered one of thebest aphrodisiacs and cures for sterility. A reference toone or both of these uses is found in the Hebrew Bible(Genesis 30:14-16). This is probably the firstreference to the plant in western literature. Thesenotions as to the power of mandrake arise from theappearance of its root system, as viewed by someonewith a little imagination. The root system is carrot-like, but it is often branched. To many people thebranched roots represent tiny humans, complete withsex organs. To others the unbranched root clearlyrepresented a man's penis. In either case, the beliefwas that the Lord, in His Infinite Wisdom, constructedthe root in such a way to give an indication of its use.This view was in keeping with the \"Doctrine ofSignatures.\"In the Middle Ages, mandrake became a cure-all.Preparations were also used in drinks to stupefy thevictim. One recent author has also claimed thatperhaps Jesus of Nazareth was given a mandrakedrink to produce a death-like trance while on thecross. Mandrake wines were used in this fashion inPalestine.Harvesting such a powerful plant was fraught withperil. The plants were so full of strong magic that theycould not be pulled from the ground by mere mortals.One way of extracting a mandrake was to draw threecircles around the plant with a sword or stick and digonly while looking west. Stuff your ears before doingthis because the plant will produce horrible, deafeningscreams as it is pulled from the ground. It is also bestto stand upwind because of the foul stench the plantsgive off. The most favorable time for doing all of thiswas a Friday evening. Apparently so many peoplewere deafened or killed by extracting mandrakes thatdogs were later substituted. One end of a rope wastied around the dog, the other end around themandrake. The dog was struck and it ran away,pulling the mandrake from the ground. Naturally, thedog died.The sedative properties of mandrake result from aseries of alkaloids, principally hyoscyamine, scopol-amine, and mandragorine. The aphrodisiac qualitiesare yet unsubstantiated.QUININE AND MALARIA\"The great gift of malaria is utter apathy.\" (Sir Richard Burton, noted explorer; not the actor)\"Malaria can strike anyone, but history and experienceshow that it affects primarily the poorest, mostperipheral and most marginal groups of a population.\" (World Health Organization)\"A tree grows which they call 'the fever tree' in thecountry of Loxa, whose bark, the color of cinnamon,is made into a powder amounting to the weight of twosmall silver coins and given as a beverage, cures thefevers and tertians; it has produced miraculous resultsin Lima.\" (An Augustinian monk writing in 1633)' ' ' ' 'MALARIA & FEVER BARK: TIMELINEBCE:  200 \u201cMarshes produce small creatures...\u201dCE:1633 \u201cA tree which they call \u2018the fever tree\u20191717 Lancisi suggests transmission by mosquitos1807 Crawford suggests malaria caused by eggs1882 King finds malaria transmitted by mosquitos1897 Ronald Ross identifies Plasmodium vivax asthe cause1820 Pelletier & Caventou isolate quinine1858 J. Schweppe patents quinine tonic water1932 Atabrine synthesized1939 Chloroquine synthesized1944 Doering & Woodward synthesize quinine1976 Quinine sulfate synthesizedThe World Health Organization estimates that onethird of the world's population is constantlyendangered by malaria. The annual death toll is about2 million and another 200-800 million are chronicsufferers. We tend to think of malaria as a disease ofthe tropics, but until control procedures becameeffective, 4-6 million people in the southern U.S. weremalaria-ridden.Malaria is caused by several species of the protozoanPlasmodium, particularly P. vivax. The protozoan iscarried in the stomach of a female Anophelesmosquito which, in turn, brings the organism to us.Plasmodium enters the body when the mosquitopierces the skin. It gets into the blood stream whereit attacks red blood cells. Their destruction and thesubsequent release of waste products bring on thecharacteristic \"chills-fever-sweat\" cycle of malaria.For centuries there was little known about its cause orpossible treatment. The method of choice used byphysicians was bloodletting. This only tended tohasten the end because the malaria victim wasanemic. Another treatment was to drink winecontaining three drops of blood from the ear of a cat.This must be administered by a woman of high birthto be effective. But, even in the days of ancient Romescholars suggested that malaria was caused by somesort of invisible creature associated with marshes.These suggestions were ignored. They were contraryto the accepted religion and science of the day. In theMiddle Ages, malaria was thought to be the result ofbreathing bad night air. Look again at the word\u201cmalaria.\u201d  Doctors recommended closing all windowsand doors at night to exclude these foul vapors.Closing the house did help, because it kept somemosquitos out.While the Old World was busy worrying about the badnight air, the Indians in the New World were using the\"fever bark\" tree or \"quina\" to control malaria. Thereis some question as to whether the Indians reallyknew of the advantages of the bark. Some suggestthat they knew quite well that it would controlmalaria, but were somewhat reluctant to share thisknowledge with the Spanish conquerors. After all,\u201cThe only good Spaniard ....\u201dThe most famous story of how the fever bark becameknown to the Europeans involves the Countess ofChinchon, wife of the Viceroy of Peru. In 1638 she fellvictim to malaria and was on the verge of death whenthe Governor of Loja heard of this and sent her some-179-of the bark of \"quinaquina\" (Quechuan for \"bark ofbarks\"). This bark effected a miraculous cure and shereturned to Spain, extolling the virtue of the Indiancure.  Linnaeus, being aware of this popular story ofthe fever bark tree, named the tree Cinchona, afterthe Countess. He misspelled her name.Unfortunately, the story is a complete myth. The firstCountess died three years before her husband wasappointed Viceroy, and the second never had malariaand died of other causes in Colombia, without everreturning to Europe.The Jesuits played an important role in the spread ofknowledge and use of the fever bark tree. They hadintimate contact with the Indians who used it regularlyand did much to bring it to the attention of Europeans.Some people were convinced that fever bark wasactually a Jesuit poison used to kill Protestants. OliverCromwell died of malaria in 1685, rather than usingthe \"Jesuit bark.\"The active ingredient in the bark is a series ofalkaloids. The best known is quinine. It is extractedfrom several species of Cinchona and from Remijiapedunculata, another member of the madder or coffeefamily (Rubiaceae). The extraction of the alkaloidallowed standardization of doses. This eliminatedmuch of the trial and error treatment of malaria. Theexact mode of action is still incompletely known. Onesuggestion is that quinine interferes with an enzymesystem of the Plasmodium. This has not beendemonstrated, however.Although Cinchona is native to South America, thechief site of production for most of this century hasbeen Java. At the time of the Second World War, 95%of the world's quinine supply came from Java. Thissource was eliminated from the Allies by the Japaneseoccupation. This initiated an intensive search forquinine substitutes and for new sources of high gradematerial in the New World.In 1944, Doering and Woodward synthesized quinine.Unfortunately, it cost about $1000 per gram. Atabrine,synthesized by the Germans in 1928, was used by theU.S. Army at the rate of a billion pills per year. Duringthe Korean War, the U.S. used chloroquine. Since thenseveral other quinine substitutes have beendeveloped. Unfortunately, not all malaria strains canbe controlled by these alkaloids. New ones are knownthat are resistant to quinine or any of its syntheticderivatives. Malaria remains our costliest disease.FOXGLOVE AND HEART DISEASE\"In the year 1775 my opinion was asked concerning afamily recipe for the cure of dropsy. I was told it hadlong been kept a secret by an old women inShropshire, who had sometimes made cures after themore regular practicioners had failed. I was informed,also, that the effects produced were violent vomitingand purging; for the diuretic effects seem to havebeen overlooked. This medicine was composed oftwenty or more different herbs; but it was not verydifficult for one conversant in these subjects toperceive that the active herb could be no other thanthe Foxglove.\" (Dr. William Withering,1785)' ' ' ' 'One of the most important heart drugs is obtainedfrom a plant of the snapdragon family, the foxglove(Digitalis purpurea + other spp.). For centuries it wasa favorite ornamental. In the 1700s, foxglove wasused by witches and others to treat dropsy. Thisdisorder was characterized by an accumulation ofliquids in the chest and abdomen, and a swelling ofthe legs and ankles. William Withering, an Englishdoctor, after hearing stories about the success of localwitches, experimented with treating dropsy patientswith pulverized foxglove leaves and found that theydid correct the disorder. In 1785 he published \"Anaccount of the foxglove and some of its medical uses:with practical remarks on dropsy and other diseases,\"which remains one of the most famed monographs inmedical history.The real importance of foxglove was not realized untilresearch showed that dropsy was a symptom of amore serious problem, heart disease. Today foxgloveremains an important tool in the treatment of heartpatients. The leaves yield cardiac glycosides, knowncollectively as the digitalis glycosides. Two of themare digitoxin (C41H64O13) and digitalin (C35H36O14).The digitalis glycosides have not been synthesized. We grow large fields of foxglove plants and usealcohol to extract the glycosides from leaves.The effects of the digitalis glycosides are:' the intervals between cardiac contractions arelengthened;' the contractions are stronger and more regular;' the pulse is more regular;' blood pressure is increased;' kidney functioning improves; and' urine is passed in copious quantities.Dr. Withering also recognized the toxic nature offoxglove when he noted, \"... when given in very largeand quickly repeated doses, [it] occasions sickness,vomiting, purging, giddiness, confused vision, objectsappearing green or yellow, increased secretion ofurine with frequent motions to part with it; slow pulse,even as low as 35 in a minute, cold sweats,convulsions, syncope [fainting as a result of deprivingthe cerebrum of oxygen], and death.\"BELLADONNA\"Belladonna, n. in Italian a beautiful lady; in English adeadly poison. A striking example of the essentialidentity of the two tongues.\"(Ambrose Bierce. The Devil's Dictionary) ' ' ' ' 'Atropa belladonna, also called the deadly nightshade,has been known for many centuries. For most of thistime, belladonna was a favorite poison. The plant isnative to central and southern Europe and Asia. Thecommon name comes from the Italian for \"beautifulwoman,\" and the generic name from Atropos, the Fatewho cuts the thread of life.The leaves contain a series of alkaloids, knowncollectively as the belladonna alkaloids. These areextracted after the leaves have been dried from 2-15weeks. Ether or ethyl acetate solvents are often used.The alkaloids are then crystallized. Some of the chiefalkaloids are atropine, hyoscyamine, andscopolamine.Atropine is used to stimulate the sympathetic nervoussystem, to dilate the pupils of the eye during-180-examinations, to relieve pain, and to reduce musclespasms. Scopolamine, a depressant, is used as asedative, in the treatment of insomnia, and to helpreduce the symptoms of motion sickness. You mayhave noticed people wearing scopolamine skin patchesbehinds their ears.OPIUM, THE GREAT PAIN KILLER\u201cAmong the remedies which it has pleased AlmightyGod to give to man to relieve his suffering, none is souniversal and so efficacious as opium.\u201d (Sydenham, 1680)Opium is the name for the crude latex extracted fromthe opium poppy (Papaver somniferum), a relative ofthe popular garden poppies. The sap that oozes fromcut surfaces on the plant contains a series of alkaloidscollectively known as opiates. They have played animportant role in medicine. Morphine, in particular,remains a widely used pain-killer and sedative. Whenadministered in small quantities (about 8 mg),morphine produces a drowsiness that soon turns intosleep. When 15-30 mg are used, the patient goes intoa dreamless sleep, can easily be awakened, but willreturn to sleep when left alone. Larger doses producea deep coma characterized by a slow respiratory rateand contracted pupils. In overdose quantitiesmorphine causes a purple discoloration of the face(cyanosis), extreme respiratory slowness, dilation ofthe pupils, and finally death. Morphine is used also tocontrol diarrhea and vomiting and to induceperspiration.Codeine, usually in the form of codeine sulfate, isused orally or subcutaneously to control coughing andas an analgesic. The abuse of the opiates aspsychoactive substances is treated in the next section.COCA LEAFCocaine, an alkaloid found in the South Americanshrub Erythroxylum coca, has some medical use as alocal anesthetic applied to the surface. It isparticularly useful in operations of the eye, nose,throat, and anus. The alkaloid is one of the activeingredients of the coca leaf, the popular masticatory.A discussion of cocaine as a psychoactive material willbe found in the next section.EPHEDRA (MAHUANG)Ephedra sinica, a relative of the Mormon tea of ourwestern deserts, is probably the oldest medicinal plantin continuous use since ancient times. The Chinesemention its use in 2700 B. C. E.  Mahuang containsephedrine, used in the treatment of bronchial asthmaand in drug poisoning. It dilates the pupils and it is aspinal anesthetic.Various herbal preparations containing ephedraappear to be the cause of a number of deaths in thepast few years. Some states have already banned itsuse; others, including California are looking into thematter.Another ephedrine alkaloid, pseudoephedrine, hasbeen the focus of recent attention because variousOTC preparations have been used to makemethamphetamine.ERGOTERGOT POISONING/USE: TIMELINEBCE:  600 \u201cA noxious pustule ... of grain\u201d  350 \u201cNoxious grasses that cause womento drop the womb and die in childbed\u201dCE:  590 Outbreak of ergot poisoning in France  941 40,000 die in France1000 First precise description of affliction1129 12,000 die1582 Lonier cites ergot to quicken childbirth1597 Infected rye cited as cause of ergotism1674 Severe outbreak in France1692 Strange behavior in Salem, MA1812 Austria confiscates contaminated rye1818 Desgranges publishes medicinal uses1824 Hosack writes of stillborn children1920 Ergonovine isolated1926 Outbreak in Russia1935 Ergotamine isolated1943 Hofmann synthesizes LSD1943 Ergocristine isolated1977 Outbreak in EthiopiaYou will recall that the alkaloids produced by the ergotfungus (Claviceps purpurea) can have deleteriouseffects on the circulatory system and on the centralnervous system. The poisoning is typically the resultof consuming bread products made out of ryecontaminated by the ergot fungus. Now we knowinglyinfect entire fields of rye grass with ergot to get a richcrop of these toxic alkaloids. Why? Because thesesubstances, given in precisely controlled quantities,are highly effective during childbirth and in thetreatment of migraine headaches. In both cases, theability of the ergot alkaloids to constrict blood vesselsis the key. During delivery, significant hemorrhagingcan occur, especially at the time of expulsion of theplacenta. The ergot alkaloids help control post-partumbleeding and they also stimulate the smooth muscle ofthe uterus.In the Middle Ages, midwives ground up the beak-likefungal bodies and gave them to women duringdelivery. They called the beaks \"mother seed\" or\"mutterkorn.\" It was not until 1920 that the alkaloidergonovine was isolated. Fifteen years later (1935)ergotamine was isolated. It is the alkaloid that ishighly effective in constricting dilated cranial bloodvessels, especially in combination with caffeine andthe belladonna alkaloids.-181-GINSENGGinseng (Panax quinquefolia + other spp.) is anotherplant highly regarded because of its almost limitlesspowers. In Asia, it is used to treat anemia, diabetes,insomnia, gastritis, and impotency. It is, \"... a tonic tothe five viscera, quieting animal spirits, establishingthe soul, allaying fear, expelling evil effluvia,brightening the eye, opening up the heart, benefittingthe understanding, and if taken for some time it willinvigorate the body and prolong life.\" Not bad!It is the root that is so highly prized. The UnitedStates exports about 200,000 tons of three to six yearold plants each year; about 90% goes to Hong Kong.This is nothing new. We have been exporting ginsengroot since Colonial times. Recent biochemical studiesshow that the roots contain a complex mixture oftriterpenoid saponins that affect the midbrain, heart,internal secretions, and blood sugar levels.GINKGOOne of the more important medicinal herbs of the lastdecade is the maidenhair tree, Ginkgo biloba, a widelyplanted ornamental tree. We use a concentratedextract made from the dried leaves. The extractcontains a mixture of flavonoids and diterpenes, thelatter known as ginkgolides A, B, and C.Two things make ginkgo exciting. It appears to beeffective in the treatment of reduced blood flow to thebrain and as a scavenger of free radicals. Some claimssuggest that GBE is also effective in the prevention ofstrokes and of Alzheimer's disease, but theseassertions have not yet been properly demonstrated.ST. JOHN\u2019S WORTHypericum perforatum is a European herb of thegarcinia family (Guttiferae). The common name isbased on the belief that the plant has been observedto release a blood red oil on 29 August, the day thatJohn the Baptist was decapitated. It has long hadmagical powers associated with it, including the abilityto ward off evil spirits. It has been a popular herbalremedy since ancient times. Hippocrates andDioscorides recommended its use.The plant contains hypericin, hyperforin, andpseudohypericin. St. John\u2019s wort has been used totreat wounds and bruises, warts, hemorrhoids,bacterial infections, influenza A & B, and herpessimplex virus 1 & 2. However, its main claim to fameis as a sedative and antidepressant. One of its currentcommon names, probably of Madison Avenue origin,is \u201cNature\u2019s Prozac.\u201d As a mild depressant, it inhibitsthe uptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, anddopamine, naturally occurring neurotransmitters.Current investigations are focused on its use in thetreatment of HIV, psoriasis, and the seasonal affectivesyndrome.St. John\u2019s wort was once a major weed in this part ofthe United States, where it is known as Klamath weed.Ranchers noticed that when their animals ate the plantthey experienced severe skin blisters. They werecaused by an interaction between sun-light and redpigments found in glands on the stems, leaves, andflowers. Humans who have taken excessive amountsof St. John\u2019s wort have experienced similar problemswhen they are exposed to sunlight.INDIAN SNAKEROOTRauvolfia serpentina has been used for thousands ofyears in India to treat the mentally ill, to rid oneself ofintestinal worms, and to cure insect bites. Untilrecently the plant was largely ignored as just anotherexample of quaint plant mythology. Today it is ofgreat importance in the treatment of hypertension andcertain kinds of mental illness, particularlyschizophrenia. The roots contain the alkaloidreserpine. It is similar to serotonin, a naturallyoccurring chemical in our brain. It has been suggestedthat schizophrenia is the result of a serotoninimbalance.Reserpine occurs in several other species of Rauvolfia.In addition to perhaps correcting a serotoninimbalance, reserpine also decreases blood pressureand pulse rate. Its action appears to be on all parts ofthe central nervous system, particularly thehypothalamus.ECHINACEA OR CONE FLOWEREchinacea or coneflower (Echinacea purpurea + otherspp.) is a 19th century \"blood purifier\" derived fromNorth American Indian herbal medicine. The termblood purifier was often a euphemism for treatingvenereal disease. Echinacea's claim to fame is that itstimulates our body's own ability to heal itself. Studiescarried out in the last 50 years would seem to showthat echinacea does cause a number of changes thatcould lead to enhanced resistance to disease,particularly colds and flu. It is also sold as a cream orlotion for the treatment of wounds and burns.FEVERFEWTanacetum parthenium, a member of the sunflowerfamily, has been used for over 2000 years to treatheadaches. It has been rediscovered and it is nowwidely used for migraine and the associated nauseaand vomiting. The active ingredients include a numberof sesquiterpene lactones that are found in the leaves.In the olden days, people simply ate the leaves, butthis often resulted in ulcers and inflammation of themouth and lips. Today it is put up as a tablet orcapsule.VALERIANValerian is the dried underground portions of Valerianaofficinalis. For a thousand years we have used thisplant for its sedative, tranquilizing powers. Studiescarried out in the last few decades show that it candepress central nervous system activity. The activeingredients have yet to be identified to everyone'ssatisfaction.PERIWINKLEThe periwinkle or Madagascar periwinkle(Catharanthus roseus) is a member of the dogbanefamily (Apocynaceae). The plants contain about 70 orso alkaloids, known collectively as the vincaalkaloids. At the time the original research was done,periwinkle was placed in the genus Vinca. The mostfamous of them are vincristine and vinblastine.They have the ability to inhibit tumor growth and to-182-arrest nuclear division. They have been verysuccessful in treating childhood leukemia, Hodgkin'sDisease (a cancer of the lymphatic system), cancer ofthe testicles, and Kaposi's sarcoma.PACIFIC YEWTaxus brevifolia is a coniferous tree of the PacificNorthwest, It contains taxol, now considered verypromising in the treatment of ovarian and breastcancers. Taxol is found in bark of about 80 year oldtrees; it is also in the needles.MEDICINAL PLANTSCommon Name (Scientific Name) Active Ingredient(s) Therapeutic Use(s)agar (Gelidium cartilagineum) Polysaccharide Bulk laxative; emulsions; lubricantsaloe (Alo\u00eb vera) Aloin Skin-softening; burn treatmentautumn crocus (Colchicum autumnale) Colchicine Treatment of goutbalsam of Peru (Myroxylon balsamum) Volatile oil Skin ointments; flavor medicinesbelladonna (Atropa belladonna) Atropine* Dilate pupils for eye examsbenzoin (Styrax benzoin) Benzoin Loosens phlegm in respiratory passagesbetel nut palm (Areca catechu) Arecoline Destroys tapeworms; treat urinary tract problemsblack pepper (Piper nigrum) Piperine* Reduces gases; stimulates heartblue cohosh (Caulophyllum thalictroides) Saponin Rheumatism; promotes menstruationbuckbean (Menyanthes trifoliata) Gentianine* Pain-killer; lowers blood pressureCalabar bean (Physostigma venenosum) Physostigmine Stimulates heart: treatment of glaucomacamphor (Cinnamomum camphora) Camphor oil Superficial pain/itching; vapors (asthma)cascara sagrada (Rhamnus purshiana) Anthraquinone glycosides Laxativecastor oil (Ricinus communis) Ricinolein Irrigates intestineschaulmoogra (Hydnocarpus wightiana) Hydnocarpic/chaulmoogric acids Treatment of leprosyChinese rhubarb (Rheum palmatum) Anthraglycosides/tannins Treat constipation/diarrheacloves (Syzygium aromaticum) Oil of clove Antiseptic/pain-killercoca (Erythroxylum coca) Cocaine Local anesthetic; heart/respiratory stimulantcomfrey (Symphytum officinale) Allantoin Treat psoriasis/other skin problemscorkwood (Duboisia myoporoides) Scopolamine Anesthetic/pain-killercranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpum) Fructose + unknown Treat urinary tract infectionsechinacea (Echinacea spp.) Polysaccharides/chicoric acid Treat infectionselecampane (Inula helenium) Sesquiterpene lactones Asthma; chest colds; antibioticergot (Claviceps purpurea) Ergot alkaloids Uterine contractions; treat migraineeucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) Oil of eucalyptus Antiseptic; treat bronchial congestionfeverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) Parthenolide Treat migraine headache, nausea, vomitingfoxglove (Digitalis purpurea) Digitalis glycosides Regulates heart beat/contractionsgarlic (Allium sativum) Disulfide* Antiseptic; reduces hypertension; antispasmodicginger (Zingiber officinale) Volatile oils Soreness; reduce gas; prevent motion sicknessginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) Glycosides Treat cardiovascular disordersginseng (Panax quinquefolia) Volatile oils CNS stimulant; complex tonic effectsgoldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) Hydrastine* Antiseptic; stops bleeding; treat stomach achesgum arabic (Acacia senegal) Gum arabic Treat sore throats, coughs; diarrheahenbane (Hyoscyamus niger) Hyoscyamine* Sedative; muscle relaxant; dilates pupilshorehound (Marrubium vulgare) Mucilage Bring up phlegm from respiratory passageIndian snakeroot (Rauvolfia serpentina) Reserpine Treat mental illness; high blood pressureipecac (Cephaelis ipecacuanha) Emetine Induce vomiting; treat persistent coughsjaborandi (Pilocarpus jaborandi) Pilocarpine Treat glaucoma; diureticJamaica quassia (Picrasma excelsa) Quassin Stimulates stomach/intestines; pesticidekaraya (Sterculia urens) Gum karaya Laxativekava (Piper methysticum) Methysticin* Tranquilizer; stimulate appetitekhat (Catha edulis) D-norpseudoephedrine CNS stimulantlignum vitae (Guaiacum officinale) Guaiaretic/guaiaconic acids Anti-inflammatory; local stimulantMadagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) Vincristine/vinblastine.

Medicinal teas -- boon or bane?  Drug Therapy February: 178-186]-196-SECTION 11 ! PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS11.1 - AN OVERVIEW' The plant kingdom is the source of most of thesubstances that affect our mental processes,behavior, or that alter our perception of theuniverse around us.' We have become dependent upon a series ofplant products that provide these psychoactiveeffects.' Many of these plants are used by individuals;others are used more commonly in a ceremonialor ritual context where they have becomeimportant elements in our religions, myths, andmagic.' These plants contain one or more chemicals(often alkaloids) that stimulate, depress, producea sense of well-being, or cause us to hallucinate.' This category overlaps with medicinal plants(opiates, cocaine, marijuana), beverages (tea,coffee, cocoa, alcohol), spices (nutmeg), andrecreational ones (tobacco).' Only a few of these plants (tobacco, alcohol, tea,coffee, cacao, coca, marijuana, and opium) are ofeconomic significance. Most of the others areused locally.' Most of what we experience from psychoactiveplants can be explained by the toxic effects thatthey have on our central nervous system.' For some yet unexplained reason, the New Worldhas more psychoactive plants than the Old World.' Many psychoactive plants are not as dangerousas their critics suggest, nor are they as risk freeas their proponents believe them to be.' Terms such as psychoactive, hallucinogenic,addictive, and narcotic have reasonably precisedefinitions, but they are often lost in everydaydiscussions.' Recent research has brought into question thepsychoactive properties of several plants withlong standing reputations, such as the mescalbean.11.2 !  INTRODUCTION\u201cIf human consciousness is the most wonderful thingon earth, the attempt to fathom the depths of thepsychophysiological action of narcotic and stimulatingdrugs makes this wonder seem greater still.... Sucheffects are brought about by chemical substances. Themost powerful of these are products of the vegetablekingdom, into whose silent growth and creativeabundance man has not yet fully penetrated. By theexercise of their powers on the brain, they releasemarvelous stores of latent energy. They relieve thementally tortured, assuage the racking pains of thesick, inspire with hope those doomed to death, endowthe overworked with new vitality and vigour such asno strength of will could attain, and replace for anhour the exhaustion and langour of the overworked bymental comfort and conten(tL.\u201douis Lewin, Phantastica)\u201cExperiences with plant drugs have puzzled andfascinated our species for millennia. They haverevealed substances powerful enough to heal or to kill.Yet, whether they help or hurt, these plants are alsopursued for their power to intoxicate with stimulating,inebriating, tranquilizing, or hallucinogenic properties.We search our planetary garden for these mind-altering delights with a passion so blinding that thegarden becomes a labyrinth, the search becomes thegoal, and our passion becomes addiction.\u201d(Ronald Siegel, Intoxication)\u201cEvery kind of addiction is bad, no matter whether thedrug be alcohol, morphine or idealism.\u201d (Carl Jung)' ' ' ' 'There are about 250,000 different kinds of plants.Only a 150 or so have been used as sources ofpsychoactive substances in either primitive oradvanced societies. Siegel (1989) has suggested thatif we look at the history of our species we will discoverthat the use of these intoxicants is one our four basicdrives, along with hunger, thirst, and sex. Of theseplants, only tobacco, opium, coca, cacao, marijuana,coffee, tea, and alcohol are of any commercialimportance.WHAT TO CALL THEM?Scholars have found it difficult to come up with anacceptable collective name for this category of plants.Those that have been suggested include: deliriants,delusionegens, eidetics, entheogens, genussmittel,hallucinogens, misperceptinogens, mysticomimetics,phanerothymes, phantastica, phantasticants,psychedelics, psychodelics, psychotica, psychoticants,psychogens, psychosimetics, psychodysleptics,psychotaraxics, psychotogens, psychomimetics,psychotomimetics, psychotropic, and schizogens.WHY DO WE USE THEM?Various authors have suggested the following reasonsfor our use of these plants. They are not in anyparticular order of importance.' to alter moods' to explore self' to escape boredom and despair' to enhance sensory experiences and pleasure' to stimulate artistic creativity and performance' to improve physical performance' to treat disease' to rebel-197-' to go along with peers' to establish an identity' to aid in religious experiences.HOW DO WE USE THEM?We have discovered a variety of ways of introducingpsychoactive materials into our bodies. Eating,drinking, and smoking of plant materials come quicklyto mind. Less obvious methods include mastication(chewing on plant material without swallowing it),inhaling/snuffing, applying materials to the skin (oftenmixed with animal fat), putting finely ground powdersunder our eyelids, injecting via the hypodermic needle(a 19th century invention), and inserting material intothe nostrils, rectum, and vagina.These different approaches have something incommon. They are designed to bring the psychoactivesubstance into contact with capillary-rich tissues or tointroduce them directly into the circulatory system.This is their pathway to chemical binding sites in thecentral nervous system. Depending on the methodemployed and the chemicals involved, it can take onlya few seconds to a few minutes for these psychoactivesubstances to reach the brain.THEIR EFFECTSWe are dealing here with plant materials that haveprofound or significant effects on our mentalprocesses. They affect our mental activity, ourbehavior, and even our perceptions of the worldaround us. Many of these substances are intoxicantsthat either dull the senses or stimulate them. Othersare narcotics. In the popular sense, this term is usedfor any dangerous drug. In the narrower sense,narcotics are those materials that induce drowsiness,sleep, or anesthesia. Some of these plants canproduce addiction. You can become enslaved to itsuse. Addiction is characterized by craving for thematerial, developing a tolerance to it, and sufferingreasonably serious trauma when we attempt to ceaseusing it (withdrawal).The classification developed by Louis Lewin (1931)may be helpful in understanding the breadth of effectsof psychoactive plants. He recognized five classes:Excitantia. \"Their action, which extends to the brainand particularly to the cerebral cortex, is a purelyexciting or stimulating one, which, even if highlyconcentrated and intense, produces these effectswithout calling forth serious symptoms of fatigue orinhibition of the functions.\" Examples: tobacco,caffeinated beveragesInebriantia. \"A primary phase of cerebral excitationis followed by a state of depression which mayeventually extend to complete temporary suppressionof functions.\" Examples: alcoholic beveragesHypnotica. These are the sleep-producing agents.Example: kavaEuphorica. \"These substances diminish or evensuspend the functions of emotion and perception intheir widest sense, sometimes reducing orsuppressing, sometimes conserving consciousness,inducing in the person concerned a state of physicaland mental comfort.\" Examples: coca and opiumPhantastica. \"... I mean the action of chemicalsubstances capable of evoking such transitory stateswithout any physical inconvenience for a certain timein persons of perfectly normal mentality who arepartly or fully conscious of the action of the drug...These phenomena may be accompanied or followed byunconsciousness or other symptoms of alteredcerebral functioning.\" Examples: marijuana, fly agaric,sacred mush-rooms, nutmeg, Jimson weed, andpeyoteYou may be surprised to find coffee, tea, chocolate,and the various alcoholic beverages classed aspsychoactive. How could it be otherwise? These plantshave been discussed elsewhere and will not be treatedfurther here. The remaining three categoriesconstitute the subjects for this section. The last class,the Phantastica, is probably the most interesting.These plants, in particular, have been afforded a veryspecial place in both primitive and advanced societies.They are the plants that bring about hallucinations.We can perceive an external object or stimulus withany of our five senses. There are visual (sight),auditory (hearing), olfactory (smell), tactile (touch),and gustatory (taste) hallucinations.SOME CHEMICALCONSIDERATIONSThe chemical basis of the activity of the many plantsclassed as psychoactive is incompletely understood.Many species have had their active principles analyzedin great detail. Others remain completely unknown.The chemical nature of the Excitantia and Inebriantiahave been discussed elsewhere. Kava of the Hypnoticacontains methysticin and other components in a seriesof related substituted 5,6-dihydro-\u00e1-pyrones.

OLD WORLD PLANTSOPIUM POPPY\u201cOh, jab me with your fine needle a hundred times,and a hundred times I will bless you, Saint Morphine.\u201d[Jules Verne]\"When I got home that night I experienced for thefirst time the white night of opium. One lies relaxedand wakeful, not desiring sleep. We dread wakefulnesswhen our thoughts are disturbed, but in this state oneis calm....\u201d [Graham Greene]\"... The next morning ... I awoke with excruciatingrheumatic pains of the head and face, from which Ihad hardly any respite for about twenty days. On thetwenty-first day I think it was ... that I went out intothe streets; rather to run away, if possible, from mytorments, than with any distinct purpose of relief. Byaccident, I met a college acquaintance, whorecommended opium. Opium! dread agent ofunimaginable pleasure and pain! ... After arriving atmy lodging (with my purchase of a copper halfpenceworth of opium), it may be supposed that I lost not amoment in taking the quantity prescribed. I wasnecessarily ignorant of the whole art and mystery ofopium-taking; and what I took I took under everydisadvantage. But I took it; and in an hour, Oheavens! what a revulsion! what a resurrection, fromits lowest depths, of the inner spirit! what anapocalypse of the world within me! That my pain hadvanished was now a trifle in my eyes; this positiveeffect was swallowed up in the immensity of thosepositive effects which had opened before me, in theabyss of divine enjoyment thus suddenly revealed.Here was a panacea, a pharmakon nepenthes, for allhuman woes; here was the secret of happiness, aboutwhich the philosophers had disputed for so manyages, at once discovered; happiness might now bebought for a penny, and carried in the waistcoat-pocket; portable ecstasies might be had corked up ina pint-bottle, and peace of mind could be sent downby mail....\"  [Thomas de Quincey]TIMELINE: OPIUMBCE:3400 Sumerians praise \u201cjoy plant\u201d2000 Reference to bhang in Atharva Veda1300 Egyptians begin cultivation and trade in opiumpoppies460 Hippocrates cites usefulness as narcotic330 Alexander the Great introduces opium intoPersia and IndiaCE:1000 Opium introduced into China1499 Amerigo Vespucci observes use of coca1527 Paracelsus formulates laudanum (opium +alcohol)1606 English ships bring home finest Indian opium1680 Thomas Sydenham formulates Sydenham\u2019slaudanum1729 Emperor Yung Chen prohibits sale ofopium/closes smoking houses1753 Linnaeus gives it scientific name (Papaversomniferum)1760 Chinese develop technique for smoking opiumwithout tobacco1767 East India Co. now exporting 2000 chests peryear to China1793 British East India Co. establishes monopoly onopium trade1796 Emperor of China prohibits importation ofopium/export of silver1799 Emperor Kia King bans poppy cultivation andtrade1805 Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner isolates morphium(morphine)1816 John Jacob Astor\u2019s American Fur Co. engagedin opium smuggling1821 Thomas De Quincey publishes \u201cConfessions ofan English Opium-eater\u201d1827 Heinrich Merck Co. begins commercialproduction of morphine1832 Pierre Robiquet isolates codeine1839 China orders all foreign traders to surrendertheir opium1839 First Opium War between England and China[to 1842]1843 Smoking of opium banned in China1853 Alexander Wood invents functionalhypodermic syringe1856 Second Opium War [to 1860]-201-1857 Opium Act of 1857 regulates cultivation and manufacture of opium1858 Treaty of Tientsin legalizes importation ofopium into China1860 Charles Baudelaire publishes \u201cLes ParadisArtificiels ...\u201d1874 C.

It is now widelycultivated and escaped. The opium poppy is closelyrelated to the ornamental garden poppies and to ourstate flower, the California-poppy. The history ofopium use is an ancient one. By the 16th century,opium was used in several standard medicaltreatments. The physician Paracelsus concoctedlaudanum, a mixture of opium and alcohol(technically referred to as tincture of opium). Englishliterature is filled with characters who used laudanumfor one thing or another. In 1732, Thomas Dover, anEnglish physician, invented a gout remedy, Dover'sPowder. In the 18th century a very popular homeremedy for diarrhea was paregoric, a mixture ofopium and camphor. It remains a popular treatmenttoday, although it must be purchased by prescriptionsince it contains a narcotic. By the end of the 19thcentury, opium-containing medicinals were socommonly used that it is estimated that 1/400Americans were addicted, many of them housewives.THE OPIUM WARS\u201c... a war more unjust in its origin, a war morecalculated to cover this country with permanentdisgrace, I do not know and I have not read of.\u201d(William Gladstone)' ' ' ' 'Opium has been involved in the statecraft of manygreat powers. In the 19th century, Great Britainwished to make trade agreements with the Chinese.The English were interested in buying tea from China,and would in turn sell the Chinese opium. TheEmperor of China objected strenuously and told hiscourt officials to have no dealings with theseforeigners. The British made \"informal arrangements\"with certain officials in Canton, and soon British andAmerican ships were taking opium into China andbringing out tea. Finally in 1838, the Emperor put anew official in charge of watching over the port atCanton. He immediately confiscated all of the opiumon British and American ships and seized thousands ofcases in warehouses on docks. The British wereinfuriated. The result was the \"Opium War.\" Britain,the leading naval power of the world, soon defeatedthe Chinese. They forced a treaty opening China totrade, creating the British Crown Colony of HongKong, and made the Chinese pay about $6,000,000 indamages for destroying the opium. The Opium War isnot remembered today by many who associate theproblem of opium with China.In 1839, Lin Zexu, Chinese High Commissioner, wrotethe following letter to Queen Victoria. \u201cThe Way ofHeaven (Tao) is fairness to all. It does not suffer us toharm others in order to benefit ourselves. Men arealike in this all the world over; that they cherish lifeand hate what endangers life. Your country lies twentythousand leagues away; but for all that the Way ofHeaven holds good for you as for us, and yourinstincts are not different from ours.We have heard that in your honorable nation, too, thepeople are not permitted to smoke [opium]... Thoughnot making use of it one's self, to venturenevertheless to manufacture and sell it, and with it toseduce the simple folk of this land, is to seek one'sown livelihood by exposing others to death, to seekone's own advantage by other men's injury.... We nowwish to find, in cooperation with your honorablesovereignty, some means of bringing to a perpetualend this opium, so hurtful to mankind; we in this landforbidding the use of it, and you, in the nations of youdominion, forbidding its manufacture.Let us suppose that foreigners came from anothercountry, and brought opium into England, andseduced the people of your country to smoke it. Wouldnot you ... look upon such a procedure with anger,and in your just indignation endeavor to get rid of it?Now we have always heard that Your Highnesspossesses a most kind and benevolent heart. Surelythen you are incapable of doing or causing to be doneunto another that which you should not wish anotherto do unto you.I now give my assurance that we mean to cut off thisharmful drug forever. What is here forbidden toconsume, your dependencies [India] must beforbidden to manufacture, and what has already beenmanufactured, Your Majesty must immediately searchout and throw to the bottom of the sea.... The lawsagainst consumption of opium are now so strict inChina that if you continue to make it, you will find thatno one buys it.Do not say you have not been warned in time. Onreceiving this, Your Majesty will be so good as toreport to me immediately on the steps that have beentaken at each of your ports.\u201dTIMELINE: THE OPIUM WARS1000: Opium introduced into China1729: Emperor of China prohibits sale of opium1793: British East India Co. establishes opiummonopoly1796: Emperor prohibits importation of opium1799: Emperor bans opium cultivation1833: British Parliament ends East India Co.monopoly1838: China confiscates British/American opium atCanton docks1839: High Commissioner Lin Zexu writes to QueenVictoria-202-1839: First Opium War: Britain vs. China (to 1842)1840: Lord Palmerston affirms China\u2019s right toprohibit use1841: British fleet arrives at Canton1842: Wm.

All parts of the plant seem to contain the latex,but the leaves lack the alkaloids that are the activeprinciple. The seeds are essentially devoid of alkaloidsas well, so poppy seed rolls may be eaten without fearof addiction.A few days after the delicate petals have fallen fromthe poppy flowers, workers enter the fields and makeincisions in the fruits. These cuts are not deep and donot pierce the seed chamber. The incisions bleed alatex that hardens in about a day. The latex is thenscraped from the fruits, removing some of theepidermis as well. This crude dried exudate is opium.Externally opium is a pale olive-brown or gray, with acoarse surface. It is often covered with poppy leavesor the plant parts from other packing material. Insideit is reddish-brown and granular. It has a very bittertaste. The use of crude opium has declined greatly inrecent years, although the tincture and camphoratedtincture of opium are still popular.THE ACTIVE PRINCIPLESOpium contains about 25 alkaloids. Morphine andcodeine are probably the best known. Their relativepercentages vary. Opium may be 5-15% morphineand 0.1-2% codeine. The function of these alkaloids inthe plant is uncertain. It has been suggested that thebitter latex may protect the plants against insects orthat the alkaloids provide a nitrogen reserve formaking proteins.Morphine is the chief narcotic principle in opium. Thereare various ways of separating it and purifying it. Inone of these, macerated opium is mixed with waterand the morphine precipitated by ammonia. Thecrystals are then purified. A similar process involvesammonia and sulfuric acid. Morphine was first isolatedin 1803. The effects of the alkaloid are a state ofpleasant drowsiness and muscular relaxation. There isa freedom from anxiety, a shortening of the sense oftime, an increased ability to discriminate, a decreasedability to concentrate, a lessening of physical activity,dimness of vision, and lethargy. Finally the subjectdrifts into a restful sleep. The advantages to medicineof such an alkaloid are immediately apparent.Morphine became one of the chief pain killers,permitting surgery under greatly improved conditions.Unfortunately, morphine exhibits both physiologicaland psychological dependence. The subject becomestolerant of it so that increased dosages are required toachieve desired results, and the withdrawal frommorphine is especially painful.Codeine is generally like morphine, but much milder.The effects of codeine are approximately 1/6 to 1/10those of morphine. Codeine is a common ingredient incough preparations. It is a narcotic and produces bothphysical and psychological  dependence. Withdrawalsymptoms are present, but they are much milder thanthose associated with morphine. Tolerance to codeinealso develops.THE SYNTHETIC DERIVATIVESHeroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine. Itis not, therefore, a naturally occurring alkaloid. Heroinis made by adding acetic anhydride or acetylchlorideto morphine. The result is a white, odorless,crystalline powder that is very bitter. It is soluble inwater. Heroin was developed in Germany in 1898 asan analgesic more powerful than morphine. Ananalgesic is a painkiller that does not render thepatient unconscious, unless it is administered in largedoses. Heroin is three or four times stronger thanmorphine. Strangely enough, it was widely used tohelp morphine addicts through their difficultwithdrawal periods and was hailed as a cure formorphine addiction. Several years passed before itbecame apparent that heroin was itself addictive.Today heroin plays no significant role in medicine. Itis under strict government supervision. Heroin addictseither inject the material, as with morphine, or theymay inhale it. Heroin is the only opiate that has aneffect on the mucous membranes of the nose.Methadone is to heroin what heroin was oncethought to be to morphine. Methadone is a syntheticdrug used to break addiction to heroin. It is slightlymore potent than morphine and it is nearly aseffective taken orally as it is by injection. Methadoneis both physically and psychologically addictive.Former heroin addicts who are using methadone mustcontinue to use methadone in its place.THE EFFECTS OF THE OPIATESThe naturally occurring and synthetic derivatives havethe following effects in humans:' pleasant drowsiness' muscular relaxation' freedom from anxiety' shortens sense of passage of time' increased ability to discriminate' decreased ability to concentrate' lessened physical activity' contracted pupils' dimness of vision' lethargy' slowed respiration' sleep' delays in emptying of stomach' slows peristalsis in small and large intestines' stimulates, then depresses the central nervoussystem' pain-killing, hypnotic, and narcotic effectsADDICTION & WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMSA number of studies have focused on the long termeffects of addiction to opiates. One of the best knownof these is the \u201cPhiladelphia General Hospital Study.\u201dIt concluded that:' addiction is not characterized by physicaldeterioration;' there is no evidence of changes in circulatory,hepatic, renal, or endocrine functions;' addiction does not cause emaciation;-203-' pale complexions are result of sedentary lifestyles;' 60% had gum disease and carries;' chronically-inflamed throats resulted fromcigarette use;' sexual potency and libido normal;' pupils were constricted, which impairs nightvision' chronic constipation was common.We have tended to confuse the effects of using opiatesover a long period of time with those that occur fromwithdrawal. They include:' constant flow of mucous;' chills and sweats;' delusions;' nausea;' diarrhea;' hemorrhaging; and' death.MARIJUANA\"They have a sort of hemp growing in this country,very like flax, except in thickness and height; in thisrespect hemp is far superior.... When therefore theScythians [inhabitants of a region in southeast Europeand Asia] have taken some seed of this hemp, theycreep under the cloths, and then put the seed on thered hot stones; but this being put on smokes, andproduces such a steam, that no Grecian vapour-bathwould surpass it.

Marijuana does very well indisturbed, nitrogen-rich wastelands near humans. Theplant has been used for about 12,000 years as thesource of fibers, oils, food, medicine, and it remainsone of the most widely used psychoactive plants.Historical references to the use of marijuana aboundin the literature. One of the more interesting tales,perhaps an apocryphal one, concerns Hassan-Ibn-Al-Sabbah, the 12th century leader of a band ofmountain raiders who swooped down on unsuspectingcaravans and Crusaders. According to legend, Hassanused to instill courage and the ability to endure painby having his men take one of the strongerpreparations from the hemp plant. The group becameknown as Hashishins, from which our modern wordassassin is derived.CLASSIFICATIONHemp was named by Linnaeus. He recognized onlyone species, Cannabis sativa, a view that is still widelyheld. Other competent experts in the field of plantsystematics argue that there are at least three speciesof: C. sativa, a taller plant of the northern latitudes;C. indica, a low-growing plant of more southerndistribution; and C. ruderalis, a small, unbranchedplant native to Russia and Europe. At various times,Cannabis has been placed in the mulberry family(Moraceae), the nettle family (Urticaceae), and in itsown family (Cannabaceae). The last opinion hasprevailed and now most botanists put marijuana inCannabaceae, along with hops (Humulus lupulus).The plants are large perennials, with male and femaleflowers occurring on separate plants. The active-204-principle is concentrated in the bracts associated withthe female flowers, although the leaves and stemsalso contain the resinous material.PREPARATIONSThe marijuana cigarette is the only form known tomost users in this country. The leaves, flowering tops,and sometimes the stems are often mixed withtobacco and then smoked. In the Old World, however,where Cannabis has been in use for thousands ofyears, several different preparations and modes of useare employed.Hasheesh or hashish, derived from the resin ofrecently fertilized female flowers, is popular amongthe Muslim peoples of northern Africa and westernAsia where it is smoked (often through a water pipe),eaten, or drunk.In India, Cannabis is used in a variety of ways. Threepreparations are commonly encountered.Bhang, is prepared from uncultivated plants. Thedried parts are powdered and then mixed with wateror milk. It is smoked or drunk. It is the weakestpreparation.Ganja or ganjah is prepared by gathering theflowering tops of very carefully selected female plants.It is usually smoked with tobacco, but it may be eatenor drunk like bhang. It is considered superior to bhangin its psychoactive effects.Charas is prepared from pure resinous materialcollected from especially cultivated female plants. It isnormally smoked, but it may be eaten. It isconsidered the most potent preparation, in that itcontains the highest percentage of active resins.ACTIVE PRINCIPLESThe resin contains a series of active and inactive non-nitrogenous compounds derived from terpenes. Theyinclude cannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabigerol,cannabichromene, cannabidiolic acid, tetra-h y d r o c a n n a b i n o l - c a r b o x y l i c  a c i d ,tetrahydrocannabinol, and its various stereo-isomers.The latter group is collectively calledtetrahydrocanninols or THC. Delta-9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol appears to be the activeprinciple responsible for producing euphoria. It is alsoavailable medically to control the nausea associatedwith cancer chemotherapy. Some forms have beensynthesized recently and are now available for clinicalstudy. Common cultivars average about 1.0-1.5%THC; some of the very potent sinsemilla (Spanish forseedless) and various hybrids now reach 12-13%. \u201cBCBuds\u201d from Vancouver, British Columbia contain 25-30% THC!PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS' Dizziness, vertigo, and light-headedness' Increased heart beat' Slight rise in blood pressure (sometimes)' Dryness of mouth and throat' Impaired coordination (ataxis)' Hunger and/or craving for sweets' Nausea and vomiting (sometimes)' Burning of the eyes' Ringing or pressure in the ears' Urge to urinate and defecate (sometimes)PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS' Vague dread/anxiety (among inexperienced)' Disorientation of thinking' Disturbance to memory' Euphoria, giggling, hilarity' Desire to speak more freely' Depersonalization' Spatial/temporal distortions' Floating sensation' Detachment' Drowsiness' Stimulation or depression or both' Heightened perception of colors, music, etc.The effects of a single, inhaled marijuana cigaretteappear to reach their maximum intensity within about30 minutes, to be diminished after about 1 hour, andto be dissipated after about 3 hours according to Weil,Zinberg, and Nelson (1968).EFFECTS FROM CHRONIC USEThere have been numerous studies looking at the longterm effects of Cannabis  on the human body. Hereare some of the conclusions reached in two classicalstudies:The India Hemp Commission Report (1894):' no substantial evidence that moderate use willproduce mental or moral injury;' no proof of connection between moderate use ofCannabis and disease; and' no proof that moderate use leads to excess anymore than in alcohol.The Laguardia Report (1944), named after the famousmayor of New York City, concluded that marijuanadoes not:' cause crime;' lead to aggressive or antisocial behavior;' alter basic personality structure;' cause sexual overstimulation;' lead to addiction (in strict sense);' lead to morphine, heroin, or cocaine addiction; ' cause juvenile delinquency.The most recent research suggests that chronic use ofmarijuana:' effects mood, perception, and psychomotorcoordination;' causes reduction in motility \u2013 initial sluggishnessfollowed in some cases by almost completeimmobility;' has profound effects on the brain, both in themanner in which sensory inputs are processedand the thinking process itself;' has little or no effect on the ability to recallpreviously learned material;' causes a relatively severe impairment of workingmemory;' does not cause structural damage to the brain;' impairs short-term memory and slows learning;' may cause transient episodes of confusion oranxiety;' increases heart rate and initially blood pressure,then lowers  blood pressure;' causes dilation of air passages;' impairs pulmonary function with prolonged heavyuse;' smoke, because of its tars, is carcinogenic;' suppresses the number and motility of humansperm;-205-' does not cause any permanent damage to themale or female reproductive system;' may affect chromosome segregation during celldivision;' has no effect on the health of offspring;' can suppress the immune system, but only indoses much higher than humans consume;' may lead to tolerance and dependence in someusers.MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANAOne of the controversies raging in the medical andlegal communities centers on whether marijuana hasany use in the treatment of disease or in providingrelief to those suffering from serious, even terminaldiseases. As recently as 1995, Governor Wilson vetoedlegislation here in California that would have mademarijuana legally available to certain individuals. In1996, the electorate passed Proposition 215 thatwould permit limited medicinal use. In 2001, theUnited States Supreme Court ruled that medicinal useof marijuana violated federal law.Advocates of its medical use argue that it is effectivein the treatment of glaucoma, side effects of cancerchemotherapy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, AIDS,chronic pain in general, migraine headaches,osteoarthritis, severe itching, premenstrual syndrome,menstrual pain, labor pain, and depression. Lesscommonly marijuana has been used to treat asthma,insomnia, severe nausea, Adult Attention DeficitSyndrome, schizophrenia, Crohn\u2019s Disease, ringing inthe ears, violence, post-traumatic stress syndrome,phantom limb pain, alcoholism, scleroderma, andterminal illnesses (Grinspoon & Bakalar, 1997).FLY AGARIC\"... [This] puts me in mind of a custom among theTartars.... The Russians, who trade with them, carrythither a kind of mushroom, which they exchange forfurs of squirrels, ermines, sables, and foxes. Thesemushrooms the rich Tartars lay up in large quantitiesfor the winter, and when a nobleman makes amushroom feast all the neighbors around are invited.The mushrooms are prepared by boiling, by which thewater acquires an intoxicating quality, and is a sort ofdrink which the Tartars prize beyond all other. Whenthe nobility and ladies are assembled, and theceremonies usual between people of distinction over,the mushroom-broth goes freely round; they laugh,talk double entendre, grow fuddled, and becomeexcellent company. The poorer sort, who lovemushroom-broth to distraction as well as the rich, butcannot afford it at the first hand, post themselves onthese occasions round the huts of the rich, and watchthe opportunity of the ladies and gentlemen as theycome down to pass their liquor; and, holding awooden bowl, catch the delicious fluid, very littlealtered by filtration, being still strongly tinctured withthe intoxicating quality. Of this they drink with utmostsatisfaction, and thus they get as drunk and as jovialas their betters.\"  (Oliver Goldsmith.1762)\"Soma was at the same time a god, a plant, and thejuice of that plant. So far as we know, Soma is theonly plant that man has ever deified.... In the courseof the Soma sacrifice the juice was pounded out withstones on resounding planks and was drunk by theofficiating priests. Soma -- the three somas -- inspiredhymns vibrant with ecstasy, composed over centuriesby priests who lived in centers remote from eachother.... Some of the hymns are [of] so exalted, evendelirious, a tenor that the modern reader is led toexclaim: 'This surely was composed under theinfluence of a divine inebriant.' It takes littleperception to sense the difference in tone between theawe-inspired hymns to Soma and the rowdy drinkingsongs of the West prompted by alcohol.\" (R. GordonWasson. 1971. Soma. Divine Mushroom ofImmortality)' ' ' ' 'Fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) is a mushroom that iscommon in the north temperate zone of bothhemispheres. It was once probably widely employedfrom Siberia through northern Europe. The use of themushroom by the Siberians came to the attention ofWesterners in the 18th century. One of the earliestreports is that of a Swedish officer who was heldprisoner by the Siberians for about twelve years. Theyapparently had no other intoxicant until the Russiansintroduced alcohol.The fly agaric is usually eaten by the men of thecommunity. It is not eaten fresh, but only after it hasbeen dried in the sun or over a fire. The dose varies,but often three are eaten; one large mushroom andtwo small ones. Some have reported consumption ofas many as twelve. The fly agaric may be eatenseparately or incorporated into soups, stews, reindeermilk, or mixed with the juices of certain plants, suchas fireweed. It may even be added to alcohol.As with all of the psychoactive plants, the mental andphysical state of the user plays an important role indetermining the effects of fly agaric. Early symptomsinclude a twitching, trembling, and slight convulsionsof the arms and legs. This is followed by a numbnessof the feet, euphoria, and a strong desire to dance.Subjects often carry on elaborate conversations withpeople who are not present and recount fantastic talesof courage and prowess. In some, there is a strongurge to confess misdeeds and sins in general. Somepeople occasionally become violent and dash aboutuntil they are exhausted and fall into a deep sleep.One of the more fascinating features of fly agaric useis that the intoxicating effect can be obtained bydrinking the urine of a person who has eaten Amanita.One can only speculate as to how this was discovered.There are stories of poor people waiting outside thehuts of the wealthy members of the community whocould afford the fly agaric. When a gentleman cameout of his hut to urinate, someone was there with abowl to collect his urine. Fly agaric users also savedtheir own urine in containers to take with them onlong trips.The psychoactive properties of Amanita have beenattributed to muscarine, but more recent work byEugster and Waser indicate the active principle ismuscimol(e), unsaturated hydroxamic acid. This isformed by the decarboxylation and loss of water fromibotenic acid.The late Gordon Wasson, a most respected amateurbotanist associated with Harvard University, suggested that the fly agaric is the famous \"soma.\"About 3500 years ago, the Aryan peoples moved intothe Indus Valley from the north. They brought withthem the cult of soma. To them the plant was divine.The Aryans composed over a thousand hymns to it.The problem is that no one today knows the identityof the plant. The cult is now dead and no physicaldescriptions of the plant have been uncovered.-206-Various workers have suggested that it was Ephedra,a peculiar gymnosperm; others that the soma ismarijuana; still others that the plant is completelymythical. Wasson, using certain linguistic devices andreferences to urine-drinking believes that soma isAmanita muscaria.NUTMEGThe nutmeg tree, Myristica fragrans, is native to theEast Indian Archipelago. In addition to providingnutmeg and mace, the seeds have been used forhundreds of years as an hallucinogen. The plant hasenjoyed a recent popularity among college students inthe United States and Europe. It must certainly be themost easily accessible of the hallucinogens.One teaspoon or so taken orally will usually producesome response. The effects are variable, but theyoften include some distortion of space and time and afeeling of detachment. Visual hallucinations are notcommon, but do occur in some users. Some aredisappointed because they get no reactions at all,while others describe illusions similar to those produceby LSD. Users complain of headaches, dry mouth,dizziness, and a general malaise. The oil in the seedscontains safrole, myristicin, and elemicin.KHATCatha edulis is a shrub native to East Africa. It isvariously called khat, kat, and qat. It is the leastknown of the masticatories in the West. MostAmerican had not heard of this stimulant until the\"Desert Storm\" operation when our newspapersreported that enemy soldiers were getting hopped-upon some exotic drug plant over there. Its leaves havebeen chewed by the inhabitants of that region and theArabian peninsula for centuries. It is a stimulant thatMuslims are permitted to use. The leaves containabout 1% d-norpseudo-ephedrine, a stimulant to thecentral nervous system.11.4 ! SOUTH PACIFICAlthough the South Pacific is a botanist's delightbecause of its rich flora, it is relatively poor inpsychoactive plants. The three species described hereare relatively unknown to those who have not visitedthe region. They are very popular masticatories.KAVAKava goes by several other names, including kava-kava, yangona, yaqona, and grog. It is prepared fromthe masticated roots of Piper methysticum, a relativeof black pepper. The shrub is widely cultivated in theSouth Pacific. A mildly intoxicating drink is prepared.Outsiders compare its flavor to dirty dish water. Itsactive principles, a series of pyrones, act on thecentral nervous system and the skeletal system toproduce a feeling of relaxation and reduced irritability,along with localized anesthetic effects. The lips andtongue go numb. The use of kava is often associatedwith important events in the life of a village, such asa wedding or the visit of an important person.Traditionally, kava ceremonies follow very preciserules. It is important that you know how to sit, whento sing, when to clap your hands, etc.' ' ' ' '\"Kava drinking on Tongariki is a relatively relaxed andunceremonious affair, without the strict adherence toprescribed etiquette characteristic of kava drinking inmuch of the Pacific. It is prepared entirely by chewing,never by the use of mortars, graters, or othermechanical aids. Boys from pre-adolescent age toyoung adulthood usually do the chewing for theirkinsmen or guests, or out of courtesy to others. Olderyouths or young men mix, wash, and wring the kavafrom the chewed pulp. Girls and women mayoccasionally participate in the chewing, whereas thiswas not so in the past. Adolescents and, more rarely,women may drink kava without censure. It is drunk invarious places within the village proper, usually in aquiet house, and strict exclusion of children andwomen from the proximity and view of theproceedings has lapsed.Usually, half of a cocoanut shell or a bowl of the samecapacity is used to prepare kava and the full contents-- about 100 ml -- drunk slowly in one draught.Sometimes twice this quantity is drunk. A kava drinkerusually eats immediately after taking the kava; thekava is prepared while the evening meal is beingcooked. The effects come on in a half our or less, andthe drinking is thus usually postponed until food isready. Those who have drunk kava find a comfortableplace to sit, often beside a dying fire in the darkhouse, where they remain hunched over and avoidinglight and sound disturbances of all sorts. Conversationceases, and slowly they fall into a kava-inducedstupor, which is not true sleep. This stage occursabout an hour after drinking. From it they can bearoused by being addressed or gently shaken, but thisruins the effect they are seeking from the kava. A fewhours after they have drunk kava they arise and walkto their own houses to fall asleep promptly again;others remain where they have first 'fallen.' In earlymorning they appear fresh and without any 'hangover-'like sequelae. Those whom we have seen walking afew hours after the drinking are usually somewhatataxic [loss of motor coordination], photophobic[sensitive to light], and slowed in their reactions. Afew who have had a higher dose are extremely ataxicand could return to their homes only with assistancefrom the children or myself. There is no belligerencyor irritability -- only a quiet and friendly somnolenceassociated with the weakness of the lower limbs andthe accompanying ataxia.The drinkers reply rationally and are well oriented totime, place, and person; they respond intelligently,even sometimes quickly, to complex questions. Brightor moving lights, noise or other sound, touch, andeven the subdued bustle of nearby activities annoythem, and the villagers of all ages have extremerespect for this. In discussions the kava users refer toa heaviness and weakness of their extremities,particularly of the feet and legs, and to an earlierparesthesia ascending from their feet to their trunkand described with such words as 'numbness,''tingling,' and 'coldness.' ... I have taken pulse ratesand blood pressure measurements on a number ofkava drinkers at varying intervals from one to threehours after drinking and found no significant changein either from that observed on the same subjectsduring examinations in the daytime, when they had nokava for the preceding eighteen hours or more.Respiration is shallow and regular; deep tendonreflexes remain intact.\"-207-(D. C. Gajdusek in Holmstedt & Kline, 1967)BETEL NUT\"She had few teeth... and had thin ravines running outfrom the corners of her mouth... usually filled withbetel juice which made her look as if her mouth hadbeen gashed by a rusty razor.\u201d (James A. Michener. Tales of the South Pacific)\"Bloody Mary's chewing betel nuts; She is alwayschewing betel nuts; Bloody Mary's chewing betel nuts,and she don't use Pepsodent.\" (Oscar Hammerstein II. South Pacific)'''''Betel nut is the world's most popular masticatory. Itis estimated that about 10% of the world's people useit regularly. In Hindi, it is called pan. The betel nut isthe seed of Areca catechu, a member of the palmfamily. A sliver of seed is placed on the leaf of Piperbetle, a close relative of the more familiar blackpepper. A layer of lime is sprinkled over this. Thewhole thing is rolled up and placed in the mouthwhere we use our tongues to move it around, withoutbeing chewed up or swallowed. Early writers claimedthat the betel nut would, \"... expel wind, removephlegm, kill germs, subdue bad odors, beautify themouth, remove impurities and induce love....\" On theother hand, lime deposits on the teeth of old betel nutusers and the revolting habit of spitting red-stainedsaliva make it fairly easy to spot the habitu\u00e9.The seeds contain several pyridine alkaloids, witharecoline being the most common and the mostphysiological active. The plant is used in human andin veterinary medicine to expel tapeworms.PITURIDouboisia hopwoodii is a member of the nightshadefamily. Plants of the genus are known for theirtoxicity, and the Australian aborigines have used themas fish and emu poisons, and as insecticides. They arecommercial sources of one of the belladonna alkaloids,scopolamine.Vegetative plant parts are smoked, often after havingbeen mixed with charcoal. Leaves are also formed intoa quid and then chewed as a masticatory. The quid istypically passed from one user to another, and storedtemporarily in the ear.11.5 ! NEW WORLDIn that we have occupied the Old World for a muchlonger time, it would be tempting to assume that thelist of psychoactive plants is much longer than that ofthe New World. For reasons that have not been fullyexplained, just the opposite is true.TOBACCO\"In the middle of the gulf... I found a man in a canoecarrying a little piece of bread... a gourd of water...and some dry leaves which must be a thing very muchappreciated among them...\" [Christopher Columbus, 13 October 1492]\"One of the merveilles of the Hearbe, and that whichedoeth bryng most admiration, is the maner how thepriests of the Indias did use it....

[Nicolas Monardes. 1557]\"... in this island [Hispaniola], as also in otherprovinces of these new countries, there are somebushes, not very large, like reeds, that produce a leaf... which (where it is used) is held in great esteem bythe natives, and very much prized by the slaves whomthe Spaniards have brought from Ethiopia. Whenthese leaves are in season, they pick them, tie themup in bundles, and suspend them near their fireplacetill they are very dry, and when they wish to usethem, they take a leaf of their grain (maize) andputting one of the others into it, they roll them roundtight together; then they set fire to one end, andputting the other end into the mouth, they draw theirbreath up through it, wherefore the smoke goes intothe mouth, throat, the head, and they retain it as longas they can, for they find a pleasure in it, and somuch do they fill themselves with this cruel smoke,that they lose their reason. And there are some whotake so much of it, that they fall down as if they weredead, and remain the greater part of the day or nightstupefied.  Some men are found who are content withimbibing only enough of this smoke to make themgiddy, and no more. See what a pestiferous andwicked poison from the devil this must be.... I haveentered the house of an Indian who had taken thisherb, which in the Mexican language is called tabacco,and immediately perceiving the sharp fetid smell ofthis truly diabolical and stinking smoke, I was obligedto go away in haste, and seek some other place. In LaEspa\u00f1ola and other islands, when their doctors wantedto cure a sick man, they went to the place where theywere to administer the smoke, and when he wasthoroughly intoxicated by it, the cure was mostlyeffected. On returning to his senses he told athousand stories, of his having been at the council ofthe gods and other high visions.\"  [Girolamo Benzoni, 1565]\"And now good Countrey men let us (I pray you)consider, what honour or policie can moove us toimitate the barbarous and beastly maners of thewilde, godlesse, and slavish Indians in so vile andstinking a custome....?

These uses were largelyreligious, medicinal, and ceremonial. They either rolledthe leaves into cigars and inhaled through the mouthor nostrils, or they inhaled the smoke of burningtobacco leaves through long hollow tubes inserted intothe nostrils. The Indians also put tobacco in claypipes, some of them with other plants in them thatacted to filter the smoke. We have extensivearcheological remains of these pipes. The Spanishwere much amazed at these sights and wroteaccounts of the savages who drank fire and whosenavels belched smoke.The fame of tobacco spread quickly to Europe. By1519 it had been introduced to Spain, and from thereit spread to the rest of the continent. It wasintroduced into France by Jean Andre Thevet in 1557.Three years later it was brought to the attention of theFrench Court by Jean Nicot, the ambassador toPortugal. It is Nicot who is commemorated in thegeneric name Nicotiana. Tobacco was introduced intoEngland by Sir John Hawkins, who brought it fromFlorida. Hawkins' tobacco was different from thatdiscovered by the Spanish. Sir Walter Raleigh didmuch to popularize the use of tobacco in England.The smoking of tobacco became controversial almostimmediately in England and Europe. In 1604, KingJames I of England wrote an unsigned pamphlet called\"Counterblaste to Tobacco,\" in which he referred tothe plant as the \"precious stink.\" (Look at the quote atthe beginning of the this section. He also slapped atax on tobacco to discourage its use. Such taxescontinue to this day and have become a most lucrativesource of income for many countries.The English colonies in America, particularly Virginia,were in the tobacco business almost since theirfounding. The English began with N. rustica, a species-209-native to the area, but much inferior to the N.tabacum used by the Spanish. In about 1610-12, JohnRolfe \"procured\" seeds of the Spanish tobacco for useby the English colonial planters. This was thebeginning of the tobacco industry in the United States.In 1615, Virginia exported 2300 lbs. of tobacco; in1629, 1,500,000 lbs., and 86,000,000 lbs. at the turnof the century.The tobacco industry has remained a southerninstitution. The oldest tobacco company in the U.S.and the world is P. Lorillard, founded in 1760supposedly with tobacco from George Washington'sVirginia plantations. Liggett and Meyers Co. wasbegun in 1822 and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in1875.In 1890, W. Duke and Sons combined with four othertobacco companies to form the American TobaccoCompany. The company soon absorbed P. Lorillard,Brown and Williamson, Liggett and Meyers, and PhillipMorris. By 1910, 82% of the 8.6 billion cigarettes soldin the U.S. were made by the American TobaccoCompany. In 1911, the government declared it amonopoly. Most of today's major companies werecarved out of the American Tobacco Co. in the legalsettlement that followed.James Buchanan Duke retained the American TobaccoCo. In 1924, Duke offered Trinity College in Durham,North Carolina, $40 million if it would change its nameto Duke University. Trinity College agreed. Duke diedin 1925, leaving an additional $40 million to hisuniversity.HOW IS IT USED?Tobacco is used in several ways. It may be smoked,snuffed, chewed, drunk, or even eaten. Today, onlysmoking, snuffing, and chewing (\u201csmokeless tobacco\u201d)remain popular. Because the leaves are smoked,tobacco is a fumatory; because it is chewed, it is alsoa masticatory. Here is a more comprehensive look athow tobacco has been used.SmokedSnuffedChewedDippedEatenDrunkLickedSmeared over bodyBlown over warrior\u2019s facesBlown over women\u2019s facesEye dropsEnemasOffered to the godsOffered as a giftNarcoticMedicineInitiation ceremonyTOBACCO AS A MEDICINEYou may have been surprised to see tobacco listed asa medicine. Historically, it has been used to treatwounds, rashes, rabies, head injuries, plague,syphilis, insomnia, thirst, hunger, toothache, scorpionbites, and migraines.PRODUCTIONThe United States leads the world in growing tobacco,with most of it grown in North Carolina, Kentucky,South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. Otherleading producers include The People's Republic ofChina,  India, and Pakistan.Tobacco is planted from seed and requires a greatdeal of care. The seedlings are subject to manydiseases with exotic names. At a certain stage in theirgrowth, the plants are \"topped\" by cutting off thegrowing point. This prevents flowering and promotesthe enlargement of leaves and the accumulation ofmaterials, including nicotine. Individual leaves areharvested from the plants, usually two or three at atime, from the bottom upward. The tobacco leaves arethen dried or cured. This process is done is twoprincipal ways. One is to air cure the leaves inventilated barns, a common sight in the South. Theother method is fire curing the leaves in smoke to addflavor. Curing over artificial heat also occurs. Aftercuring the leaves are gathered into \"hands\" and thensold to buyers. After the purchase they are usuallyallowed to age for a period of six months to threeyears. Fermentation occurs during this period, and thecharacteristic aroma develops. The percentage ofnicotine in the leaves also decreases.NICOTINEMany of the desirable and undesirable effects oftobacco may be attributed to the alkaloid nicotine(C10H14N2). Its effects on the human body arecomplex. It can:' stimulate autonomic ganglia;' stimulate skeletal neuromuscular junctions;' stimulate sympathetic nervous system;' increase heart rate (10-20 bpm);' increase blood pressure (5-10 mm mercury);' increase cardiac stroke volume/output;' increase coronary flow;' produce initial arousal, then relaxation;' cause changes in brain wave patterns;' act on midbrain \u201creward system\u201d region; and' cause the release of dopamine.The amount in a cigarette, though not particularlyhigh, is still harmful. Nicotine is a potent poisoncausing:' vomiting;' nausea;' evacuation of the bowels and bladder;' mental impairment;' twitching and convulsions;' blood to coagulate more easily, which can lead tothe formation of thromboses; and' inflammation and chronic lung disease.Forty to fifty milligrams taken orally can be fatal in anadult. The dependence of the body on nicotine is stillbeing investigated.  Last year the U. S. Food and DrugAdministration declared nicotine to be an addictivesubstance. As you are aware, multi-billion dollarlawsuits are working their way through the courts thatrest, at least in part, on that very point. Did thetobacco companies not only know of the addictivenature of nicotine, but engage in practices that wouldenhance it?SMOKING AND HEALTH\"Smoking is the largest single cause of chronic diseaseand premature death in our society.\"Recent work indicates that nicotine may be only onepart of the problem. Tobacco smoke contains over4000 combustion products, 400 of them toxic, and 40of those are carcinogenic. They include:  nitrogen,-210-oxygen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide,ammonia, various resins, essential oils, methylalcohol, acetone, formic acid, butyric acid, and aceticacid. In December 1997, the Liggett Tobacco Groupreleased additional ingredients used in its L & Mcigarettes. They include molasses, patchouli oil,licorice flavoring, valerian root extract, vanilla extract,and cedarwood oil.Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and it isa major factor in deaths from coronary heart disease,chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other diseases. Itis also involved in cancer of the pancreas, esophagus,mouth and throat, larynx, bladder, kidneys, andcervix. Over 400,000 Americans die each year fromtobacco-related causes. Another 6000 will die from theeffects of second hand smoke. By comparison, 30,000die each year from sexually-transmitted diseases,25,000 from motor vehicle accidents, and 20,000 fromabuse of illicit drugs.Bidis (also called beedies or beadies) are cigarettesimported from India. They are very popular withyounger smokers. Bidis have the tobacco wrapped inleaves from a  relative of the persimmon tree, andtied with colored thread. They are typically flavoredwith chocolate or strawberry. The Center for DiseaseControl cautions that bidis have about three timesmore carbon monoxide and nicotine and about fivetimes the tar found in regular cigarettes.COCA LEAF \"Which is it today,\" I asked, \"morphine or cocaine?\"...It is cocaine,\" he said ... \"would you care to try it?\"\"No, indeed,\" I answered brusquely... \"Perhaps youare right, Watson... I suppose that its influence isphysically a bad one. I find it, however, sotranscendently stimulating and clarifying to the mindthat its secondary action is a matter of smallmoment.\" [Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]\"They may have found a substitute for its [tobacco's]narcotic qualities in the coca ..., or cuca, as called bythe natives. This is a shrub which grows to the heightof a man. The leaves when gathered are dried in thesun, and, being mixed with a little lime, form apreparation for chewing, much like the betel-leaf ofthe East. With a small supply of his cuca in his pouch,and a handful of roasted maize, the Peruvian Indian ofour time performs his wearisome journeys, day afterday, without fatigue, or, at least, without complaint.Even food the most invigorating is less grateful to himthan his loved narcotic. Under the Incas, it is said tohave been exclusively reserved for the noble orders.If so, the people gained one luxury by the Conquest;and, after that period; it was so extensively used bythem, that this article constituted a most importantitem of the colonial revenue of Spain. Yet, with thesoothing charms of an opiate, this weed so muchvaunted by the natives, when used to excess, is saidto be attended with all the mischievous effects ofhabitual intoxication.\" [William H. Prescott. 1847.History of the Conquest of Peru]\"I naturally learned to chew ... toasted coca leavesand, finding it to be a most helpful custom when onemust work hard and there is little food, I used coca foreight years while in these remote areas, withabsolutely no desire to continue upon my return.Cocaine, the powerful alkaloid extracted from theleaves is, of course, a very dangerous addicting drug.But coca leaves, as they are used by the SouthAmerican Indians, particularly in the bleak Andeanheights, are not addictive and they do serve a usefulpurpose enabling undernourished, debilitated personsto do a day's work and thus, at least, survive. Theenergy expended upon punitive internationallegislation against coca leaves might better besupplanted by an all-out attack upon the basicproblems of malnutrition, disease, and a system whichin many respects resembles paid slavery.\u201d\"A spoonful or two is put into the mouth. Conversationis impossible, until the powder has slowly beenmoistened and packed with the tongue between thegums and the cheeks. It is not chewed but is allowedgradually to mix with saliva and pass into thestomach. When the amount of powder is thusdiminished, it is replenished with an additional supply.Normally, a supply is kept in the mouth throughoutthe day.... Coca powder has an initial bitter tastewhich puckers up the mouth. The first noticeableeffect is a slight anaesthetizing of the tongue andmouth; this is followed by a general stimulation....The stimulation and capacity for performance andendurance which coca affords the individual and itsability to suppress hunger pangs gives the drug therole of an indispensable vademecum in the more orless itinerant life of deprivation which many Indians ofthe northwest Amazon must undergo.\u201d[Richard Evans Schultes, Harvard ethnobotanist]\"Woe to you, my Princess, when I come, I will kiss youquite red and feed you to you are plump.

Mastication, from a Greekword meaning \"to gnash the teeth,\" is the technicalterm for the chewing of food or other material,thereby rendering it easier to digest. A fewpsychoactive plants are considered masticatoriesbecause we chew the tissues, typically withoutswallowing them. The process is critical because itbrings the enzymes in our saliva into contact with theactive principles in the plant. Leaves are harvested from two shrubs (Erythrox-ylumcoca and E. novogranatense) native to South America.In older literature, the generic name Erythroxylon wasused for these plants. A person who chews the cocaleaf is a coquero. The pouch used to carry leaves isa chuspa. The gourd that contains the powderedmaterial to stimulate salivation and the action of thealkaloid is an iscupuru; the powder itself is calledllipta.As Dominic Streatfeild (2001) put it, \u201c... in its heart,South America runs on Coca Time.\u201d Both distance andtime are measured in terms of the amount of coca leafconsumed. The standard unit is the cocada, one ofwhich is the amount needed to walk at a comfortablepace on level ground for about 45 minutes or 3 km.HISTORYCoca leaves have been chewed by the Andean Indiansfor centuries to enable them to work harder and towalk longer distances through the mountains. TheGreat Inca himself once controlled its use. The leavesmature in about three or four years. An average chewis not more than 2 oz. per day. Coca leaves are oftenchewed in conjunction with powdered lime or ashes,typically carried in a purse or gourd.Angelo Mariani, a Corsican chemist, was aware ofrecent research, particularly that of Paulo Mantegazza,on the benefits of the coca leaf. He determined earlyon that Europeans would not take well to the habit ofchewing coca leaves, but that they would drink it. Hesoaked coca leaves in a pint of Bordeaux wine. Itsflavor masked that of coca and the alcohol enhancedthe leaching of the alkaloids. He named his newconcoction Vin Mariani and offered it for sale in1863. To say that it was an instant success would bean understatement! Mariani was also skilled atadvertising his new coca leaf wine, especially atgetting endorsements from the rich and famous. Avery incomplete list would include Thomas Edison,Henrik Ibsen, Auguste Bartholdi (who built the Statueof Liberty), Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, President WilliamMcKinley, Pope Leo XIII, and General U. S. Grant.Vin Mariana was so successful that he created anentire line of coca leaf products, including a throatlozenge, a non-alcoholic tea, and Elixir Mariana, withadded alcohol.One of the major figures in the history of cocaine isSigmund Freud (1856-1939), the Austrian physicianwho developed the theory of psychoanalysis. Early onin his career, he began reading about coca leaves andhow they enabled Indians in South America to \u201cresistprivations and hardships.\u201d He started using ithimselfand was so pleased with the results that he notonly recommended cocaine to his friends andcolleagues, but he supplied them with it. One suchrecipient was Martha Bernay, his future wife. Freud,who had not seen Martha for over a year, wrote to herin 1864 of his upcoming visit:\u201cIn my last serious depression I took cocaine againand a small dose lifted me to the heights in awonderful fashion. I am just now collecting theliterature for a song of praise to this magicalsubstance.\u201d His \u201csong of praise\u201d was \u00dcber Coca, published in1884. Students of Freud\u2019s writings say that it was anunusual work for him, in that he wrote so warmlyabout the subject and that the paper was marred bya series of minor errors. He noted, \"The psychic effectof cocaine consists of exhilaration and lasting euphoria... which does not differ from the normal euphoria ofa healthy person.... Absolutely no craving for cocaineappears after the first, or repeated, taking of thedrug.\"In 1885, reports of the dangerous side effects ofcocaine use appeared in the scientific literature. Thisaspect of the drug became very personal for Freudwhen he saw it destroy the life of his close friend,Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow, who was himself a brilliantand successful physician. Unfortunately, as the resultof an accident and subsequent amputation of histhumb, Ernst developed an extremely painful nervecondition. Over a period of time, he becamecompletely addicted to morphine. After seeing hisfriend in such a terrible straight, Freud offered himcocaine, which had recently been shown to curemorphine addiction. And, it worked! A year or so later,Ernst was now completely dependent on cocaine,taking what Freud estimated to be the equivalent of agram of pure alkaloid each day. The effects wereterrifying. Freud would later spend what he describedas \u201cthe most frightful night of my life\u201d caring for hisold friend. What Freud did not know was that Ernstwas not only hooked on cocaine, but that he had goneback to morphine, too. Freud estimated that Ernstwould live for only a few more months, but he hungon for six more years. Freud kept a photograph of hisfriend hanging above his desk for the rest of his life.MODE OF ACTIONCocaine, an alkaloid, can be extracted from the leaveswith almost any organic solvent. It is chemicallyrelated to atropine and the other belladonna alkaloids.Cocaine is a stimulant to all parts of the centralnervous system. It produces its effects by increasingthe concentration of dopamine in certain regions ofour brain, especially those that produce a feeling of-212-pleasure. Dopamine is a naturally occurringneurotransmitter, a category of chemicals that carrymessages between nerve cells or between nerve andmuscle cells. The intense euphoria that results fromthese higher concentrations of dopamine is the \u201crush\u201dthat coke users describe. It is followed by the \u201ccrash\u201dthat comes when cocaine is flushed out of our system.Even natural dopamine levels are reduced, whichmeans that you will feel worse after cocaine wears offthan you did before. So what do we do? We soon findourselves in a feedback loop.Cocaine was once widely used as a local anesthetic.When applied topically, it paralyzes sensory nerveendings. It can produce a profound feeling of well-being, alertness, increased self-confidence,magnification of normal pleasures, reduction in socialinhibitions, and an enhancement of emotions andsexual feelings. Abuse of cocaine, which has becomea major health problem in this country, ischaracterized by:' headaches' seizures' strokes (especially in young people)' severe complications in pregnancy and childbirth(abortions, fetal death, premature birth, smallbabies)' paranoia' loss of weight and appetite' pallor' insomnia, and' what amounts to an all-consuming focus on itsuse, to the exclusion of concerns about eating,sleeping, money, responsibilities, and loved ones.Mood swings may be dramatic -- from elation tomania and delusions. There is reasonably decentevidence that Robert Louis Stevenson wrote \"TheStrange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" while underthe influence of cocaine.Crack is a highly addictive form of smokable cocainehydrochloride. It is made by adding ammonia orsodium bicarbonate and water, and then heating themixture. When it cools to room temperature it formspebble-sized crystals. The term \u201ccrack\u201d refers to thesound made when it is smoked. It takes only about 7-10 seconds for the active principles to reach the brainand heart.PEYOTE\"[There] is another herb, like native tunas [a prickly-pear cactus]; it is called peyotl; it is white; it grows inthe north region.... Those who eat or drink it seevisions either frightful or mirthful; the intoxicationlasts two or three day and then ceases. It is acommon food of the Chichimecas, for it sustains themand gives them courage to fight and not to feel hungernor thirst; and they say that it protects them from alldangers.\" [Bernardino de Sahagun. General History ofThings of New Spain]\"On Good Friday, I found myself entirely alone in thequiet rooms in the Temple which I occupy when inLondon and judged the occasion a fitting one for apersonal experiment. I made a decoction ... of threebuttons, the full physiological dose, and drank this atintervals between 2.30 and 4.30 p.m. The firstsymptom observed during the afternoon was a certainconsciousness of energy and intellectual power. Thispassed off, and about an hour after the final dose Ifelt faint and unsteady; the pulse was low, and I foundit pleasanter to lie down.... The appearance of visionswith closed eyes was very gradual. At first, there wasmerely a vague play of light and shade whichsuggested pictures, but never made them. Then thepictures became more definite, but too confused andcrowded to be described.... Then, in the course of theevening, they became distinct, but still undescribable-- mostly a vast field of golden jewels, studded withred and green stones, ever changing. This momentwas, perhaps, the most delightful of theexperience....\u201d  [Havelock Ellis. 1898]\"A vase containing a rose, iris, and carnation...nothing more, and nothing less than they actuallywere, a transience that was yet eternal life, aperpetual perishing that was at the same time pureBeing, a bundle of minute particulars in which, bysome unspeakable and yet self-evident paradox, wasto be seen the divine source of all existence.\"  [Aldous Huxley. 1954.

It grows in the desertsof the American Southwest and in adjacent Mexico. Itsnatural distribution is centered in the Valley of the RioGrande. Peyote is one of the most fantastic vision-inducing plants of the New World. Perhaps because ofthis and the associated belief in its therapeuticproperties, it is the most sacred hallucinogenic plantof this hemisphere.-213-The common name of the plant is derived from theNahautl word \"peyotl,\" meaning a silk cocoon orcaterpillar's cocoon, a reference to the hairs presenton the upper part of the plant. HISTORY. No one knows exactly how far back in thehistory of the New World the peyote use goes.Sahag\u00fan suggested that the plant was in use in 300B.C. The Spanish historians make numerousreferences to the plant. The missionaries tried tostamp out the peyote cults of Mexico with littlesuccess. After almost 400 years of both religious andgovernmental sanctions, peyote is still widely used. Inthe past one hundred years its use by AmericanIndians has dramatically increased.Early opposition to the plant was directed mostly atthe pagan connotations that it had, rather than anyphysical or mental harm that it might be doing to theIndians. In a religious manual of the late 1700'sentitled \"El Camino del Cielo\" the priest is instructedto ask prospective converts if they had eaten the fleshof man, eaten the peyotl, or sucked the blood ofothers. A \"yes\" answer to any of the above apparentlyeliminates one as a serious candidate. Even Indianswho were thought to be converted to the new religionstill retained remnants of their old ways. It was notuncommon for parents to tie small bags of peyotearound the necks of their children to keep themhealthy. Older Indians also bowed when passing aplant. Combinations of peyote cults and Christianityappear, as seen in such titles as \"El Ni\u00f1o de Peyotl,\"and \"El Santo de Jesus Peyotes.\"The earliest uses of peyote in the United States goback to about 1760 in the territory that would becomeTexas. The plant was in common use by Indiansduring the Civil War. The spread of knowledge ofpeyote may have involved the Plains Indians' raidingparties that went into the Mescalero Indian territory ofthe Southwest. They saw the plant being used andbrought the information back with them. In the late1800's the Kiowa and Comanche Indians hadformulated a ceremony that was to become the basisof the peyote cult in more than thirty tribes. Theyformed semiofficial groups, such as the \"PeyoteSociety,\" and finally organized into the legallyconstituted body known as the Native AmericanChurch. Present membership of this group isestimated at 250,000, including members fromessentially all states and some of the provinces ofCanada. At first the Native American Churchencountered difficulty from the U.S. governmentbecause of the use of peyote during religiousceremonies. In 1933 John Collier, the Head of theBureau of Indian Affairs, succeeded in getting aregulation passed that \"...prohibited absolutely anyinterference by the Indian Bureau with the religiouspractices of the Native American Church.\" In 1962,the State of California decided that peyote had noreligious significance and attempted to prosecute theIndians. The American Civil Liberties Union enteredthe case and the Indians were ultimately victorious.RITUAL USE. In northern Mexico, the peyoteceremony usually involves a long meeting with lots ofdancing. In the U.S., the Indians use a ratherstandardized ritual patterned after the Kiowa-Comanche ceremony of the late 19th century. Thereare, of course, certain tribal variations. Often specialclothing must be worn and certain taboos must beobserved. The peyote ceremony consists of an allnight meeting in a special teepee or other speciallydesignated structure. The worshipers sit in a circlearound the peyote altar. Special drums, gourd rattles,and a carved staff are passed around after certainpurification ceremonies. The worshipers are led inprayer, meditation, and chanting by a cult leader or\"roadman.\" The peyote ceremony ends with a ritualbreakfast consisting of parched corn, fruits, water,and boneless meat. In most cases the ceremonycombines elements of both Christian worship andIndian belief.Peyote is usually consumed in the form of mescalbuttons the dried brown tops of the cactus. Thebutton is the above ground photosynthetic portion ofthe plant. Much of the plant body is below the surface.The dried buttons may be stored indefinitely. Themescal buttons are usually taken into the mouth andsoftened by rolling them in saliva. They are swallowedwithout chewing. Some users prefer to soak them inwater and make a drink from the buttons. The numberof buttons consumed varies from three or four toabout thirty.EFFECTS. The resulting intoxication is one of the mostcomplex known from any psychoactive plant. It ischaracterized particularly by brilliant colorhallucinations. These are often accompanied by tactile,auditory, and olfactory hallucinations. Many usersdescribe a sensation of weightlessness, doubling ofthe ego, and depersonalization. Alteration or loss oftime is common. Symptoms of hallucinating varygreatly from individual to individual and with thesource of material. Injection of any one of thealkaloidal principles can produce some of thesensations, but the effects of intoxication from theentire button should be distinguished from the resultsof injecting any one of these principles.ACTIVE PRINCIPLES. The peyote cactus contains atleast fifteen different alkaloids. The most famous ofthese is mescaline (3, 4, 5-trimethoxy-phenylethylamine). It is the alkaloid responsible forthe pronounced color visions.MESCAL BEANWhile I suspect that most everyone has heard ofpeyote, the mescal bean or red bean is a new plant formost of us. Sophora secundiflora, a member of thebean family, is native to the American Southwest andthe adjacent regions of Mexico. Early reports byCabeza de Vaca (1539) indicate that the plant was intrade. The Stephen Long expedition in 1820 reportedthat the Arapaho and Iowa Indians using it as amedicine and a narcotic. The mescal bean is knownfrom archaeological sites in the Southwest from aboutA.D. 1000.Well-developed mescal bean cults were known inmany Indian tribes, including the Apache, Comanche,Delaware, Iowa, Kansa, Omaha, Oto, Osage, Pawnee,Ponca, Tonkawa, and Wichita. In most cases thebeans were used in initiation ceremonies and fordivination. The hallucinogenic effects were apparentlynot pronounced and much of the mescal bean fervordeclined rapidly with the introduction of peyoteceremonies. Today most of the details concerning thenature of mescal bean ceremonies is unknown.The use of the mescal bean did not completely diewhen the peyotl cactus cults began. Even today theleaders of the peyote ceremonies sometimes wearnecklaces of Sophora secundiflora. The Comanche,Oto, and Tonkawa Indians have mixed peyote andmescal beans together, perhaps leading to some ofthe confusion in names that now exists.-214-THE SACRED MUSHROOMS\"As I was perfectly well aware that my knowledge ofthe Mexican origin of the mushrooms would lead meto imagine only Mexican scenery, I tried deliberatelyto look on my environment as I knew it normally. Butall voluntary efforts to look at things in theircustomary forms and colours proved ineffective.Whether my eyes were closed or open, I saw onlyMexican motifs and colours. When the doctorsupervising the experiment [Hofmann had ingestedPsilocybe mexicana] bent over me to check my bloodpressure, he was transformed into an Aztec priest,and I would not have been astonished if he had drawnan obsidian knife. In spite of the seriousness of thesituation, it amused me to see how the Germanic faceof my colleague had acquired a purely Indianexpression. At the peak of the intoxication, about 1\u00bdhours after ingestion of the mushrooms, the rush ofinterior pictures, mostly changing in shape and colour,reached such an alarming degree that I feared that Iwould be torn into this whirlpool of form and colourand would dissolve. After about six hours, the dreamcame to an end. Subjectively, I had no idea how longthis condition had lasted. I felt my return to everydayreality to be a happy return from a strange, fantasticbut quite really experienced world into an old andfamiliar home.\"  (Albert Hofmann, Swiss biochemistand discoverer of LSD]' ' ' ' 'When the Spanish conquered Mexico, they found theAztecs using certain mushrooms as a sacrament intheir religious ceremonies. The Aztecs referred to theplants as teonanacatl, which translates roughly asthe \"flesh of the gods.\" The Roman Catholic clergywas strongly anti-mushroom because these fungipresented a stumbling block for the establishment ofChristianity in the New World. The Aztecs could seelittle advantage to this new religion when the use ofthe sacred mushroom allowed them to speak directlyto their deities.There are ancient references to the use of the sacredmushrooms. Artifacts from Guatemala show clearrepresentations of them. These pieces are about 3000years old. When first discovered they were thought tobe phallic symbols.Most of our knowledge of the sacred mushrooms hascome from investigations done in Mexico in the pastfew decades. In 1915 William Safford, a notedAmerican ethnobotanist, suggested that the sacredmushrooms were not really fungi at all, but peyote.Safford pointed out that no one had seen anyMexicans eating mushrooms for over four hundredyears, but that the peyote cult was well known. Sincethat time, extensive field work has shown the use ofmushrooms by the Indians of the State of Oaxaca.The Indians of Mexico use at least 24 species ofPsilocybe, Stropharia, Conocybe, and Panaeolus.Collectively we refer to them as the sacred mush-rooms.The chemistry of the mushrooms is not completelyknown. Psilocybe mexicana contains psilocybine (4-hydroxy-dimethyltriptamine), which is allied tobufotenine and serotonin.THE DATURAS\u201cDatura stramonium acts very powerfully upon thecerebrospinal system, causing a line of symptomsshowing it to be a narcotic-irritant of high degrees.The symptoms collated from many cases of poisoningby this drug are: vertigo, with staggering gait, andfinally unconsciousness; stupor and deep sleep, withstertorous breathing; mania, with loquaciousness ormelancholia; hallucinations of terrifying aspect, thepatient bites, strikes, and screams, and throws thearms about, or picks and grasps at unattainableobjects; congestive headaches, with dull beating andthrobbing in the vertex. The pupils are dilated, andthe patient suffers from photophobia [sensitivity oflight], diplopia [double vision], and hemeralopia [dayblindness]; the eyes are wide open, staring and set, orare contorted, rolling, and squinting. The facebecomes red, bloated, and hot, the mouthspasmodically closed, and the tongue dry and swollen;the patient suffers greatly from thirst, but the sight ofwater throws him into a spasm and causes greatconstriction of the throat, foaming at the mouth, butseldom vomiting. The sexual functions are oftenexcited, more especially in women, in whom it causesnymphomania. Spasms of the muscles of the chestare of frequent occurrence; inspiration is slow andexpiration quick. Paralysis of the lower limbs and lossof speech, with twitchings and jerkings of the musclesoften mark a case. Its action will be seen to be similarto that of Belladonna, yet differing in many respects.[Mitilda Cox Stevenson. 1915. Ethnobotany of theZu\u00f1i Indians....]\"The James Town Weed (which resembles the ThornyApple of Peru, and I take to be the plant so call'd) issupposed to be one of the greatest Coolers in ourWorld.

TheHistory and Present State of Virginia]' ' ' ' 'Species of Datura, a member of the nightshade family,are native to both the Old World and New World. Theyhave been used since prehistoric times. In the OldWorld, Chinese and Sanskrit literature make severalreferences to the use of these plants. The genericname is derived from the Hindi word \"dhatura.\" InAsia the seeds of Datura are still used by thieves tostupefy their victims. A group of thugs called theDhatureas once used the plant to kill their victims.-215-USES OF THE DATURASMedicinal:\u201ccureth all inflammation whatsoever\u201dTreat bruises and woundsAsthma preparationsAnesthetic (surgery)AphrodisiacToxic plant (stun, punish, stupefy, or kill victims)Recreational drug useRitual/ceremonial use:DivinationVisionary journeysShape-shifting (birds)ClairvoyanceInitiation ceremoniesFuneral ceremoniesMagic (\u201cherbe aux sorciers\u201d)Discipline unruly childrenZombification (making zombies)The real ethnobotanical center of Datura is the NewWorld. Here the plants assume great medicinal,religious, and magical importance. In North Americathe plants are used mostly in the American Southwestand in adjacent Mexico. However, the Algonquins andother Indian tribes of the eastern woodlands used theJimson weed (Datura stramonium) in initiationceremonies for the young males of the tribe.The species most commonly employed in theSouthwest and Mexico is the sacred datura, D. inoxia(= D. meteloides in the older literature). Among theZunis, for instance, the plant was used as a narcotic,an anaesthetic, and a poultice for wounds and bruises.The rain priests of the tribe put the powdered root ofthe sacred datura in their eyes and ate the root toenable them to talk with the dead and ask for rain.Their belief was that the plant was divine and couldonly be used by members of the priest caste. The useof the plant in Mexico antedates the Conquest. TheAztecs used \"toloatzin\" as both a medicine andnarcotic.RITUAL USE. In South America, different species areemployed in weird and wonderful ways. Several ofthese plants, belonging to the genus Brugmansia(once part of Datura ), are large shrubs or small trees.In Ecuador the plants are used to produce a deepsleep in children who have been misbehaving. Duringthe sleep the children hear the voices of theirancestors who admonish them for their poor behavior.In Pre-Conquest Bogot\u00e1, the wives and slaves of deadchieftains and warriors were drugged with Brugmansiabefore being buried alive with their departed husbandsor employers. Among the Jivaro Indians the plant isused as part of an initiation ceremony for the youngboys of the tribe. A boy is expected to take a sip of aninfusion from the plant from each member of thetribe. Soon he is unable to drink any more. The ritualdoes not cease, however. He is given an enema of theinfusion. During the unconscious period that follows,the boy is supposed to forget all of his boyhood waysand awake a man.\"The Solemnity of Huskanawig is commonly practis'donce every fourteen or sixteen years, or oftener, astheir young men happen to grow up. It is anInstitution or discipline which all young men mustpass, before they can be admitted to be of the numberof the Great Men.... The whole Ceremony is performedafter the following manner.[The] principal part of the business is to carry theminto the Woods, and there keep them underconfinement, and destitute of all Society, for severalmonths; giving them no other sustenance, but theInfusion, or Decoction of some Poisonous IntoxicatingRoots [Datura stramonium or wysoccan]; by virtue ofwhich Physick, and by the severity of the discipline,which they undergo, they become stark raving Mad;In which raving condition they are kept eighteen ortwenty days.... When the Doctors find that they havedrank sufficiently of the Wysocccan, (so they call thismad Potion) they gradually restore them to theirSenses again, by lessening the Intoxication of theirDiet; but before they are perfectly well, they bringthem back to their Towns, while they are still wild andcrazy, through the Violence of the medicine. After thisthey are very fearful of discovering any thing of theirformer remembrance; for if such a thing shouldhappen to any of them, they must immediately beHuckanaw'd again; and the second time the usage isso severe, that seldom any one escapes with Life.Thus they must pretend to have forgot the very use oftheir Tongues, so as not to be able to speak, nounderstand any thing that is spoken, till they learn itagain. Now whether this be real or counterfeit, I don'tknow; but certain it is, that they will not for sometime take notice of any body, nor any thing, withwhich they were before acquainted, being still underthe guard of their Keepers, who constantly wait uponthem every where, till they have learnt all thingsperfectly over again. Thus they unlive their formerlives, and commence Men, by forgetting that theyever have been Boys....\"  (Robert Beverly. 1705. TheHistory and Present State of Virginia.)ACTIVE PRINCIPLES. The daturas manufacture aseries of the tropane or belladonna alkaloids. They areresponsible for the effects on the central nervoussystem.SYMPTOMS OF TOXICITY. Symptoms appear withina few minutes to a few hours after ingestion of plantmaterial. They include:' intense thirst' dilated pupils; avoidance of light' flushed skin' delirium' picking at imaginary objects on clothing or in air' convulsions' coma' death from respiratory paralysisHALLUCINOGENIC SNUFFSTobacco leaves are not the only plant that we snuff.The indigenous peoples of South America havediscovered that they could reduce dried leaves, bark,and seeds to a fine powder and sniff it into thenostrils, with dramatic effects.EP\u00c9NA, also known as yakee, parica, and nyakwana,is one of the widely used hallucinogenic snuffs of theAmazonian region. It goes by various names,depending upon the tribe that prepares it. Althoughthe use of snuffs probably goes far back into thehistory of the New World Indians, detailed botanicaland ethnobotanical knowledge is relatively recent.They were first described in detail after an expeditionto Colombia in 1954.In some tribes, particularly those that refer to thesnuff as yakee, only the witch doctors are allowed toprepare and use the plant. It is felt that during thehallucinogenic phase they are better able to diagnosedisease and to see into the future. Yakee is often-216-prepared from Virola calophylla and V. calophylloidea,species of the family Myristicaceae. Nutmeg and maceare also derived from this family.In other tribes, the ep\u00e9na or nyakwana snuff isprepared from V. theiodora. Generally speaking, anymale member of the tribe may use ep\u00e9na. Thepreparation of the Virola snuffs involves removing thebark from trees, scraping off the inner bark thatcontains a resinous exudate, mixing the resin withwater, and boiling it down into a thick syrup. Thesyrup is sun-dried, pulverized, sifted, and mixed withthe ashes of other plants. The exact recipe and choiceof supplementary plants varies with the tribe.The effects of intoxication vary, but usually include aninitial phase of excitability, numbness of the limbs,twitching of the facial muscles, loss of coordination,visual hallucinations, including macroscopia, andfinally a deep sleep.The Virola plants contain tryptamines in relatively highpercentages. These are believed to be the activeprinciple. These same plants are also used to makearrow poisons.YOPO or PARIC\u00c1 is a strong hallucinogenic snuffprepared from the seeds of Anadenanthera peregrina,a South American legume. Records from 1511 relatethe inhaling of the snuff through long tubes. Thisspecies is probably the basis of many reports ofsnuffing by the South American Indians. Many ofthese reports are now thought to be unfounded andthe use of yopo is more restricted than once believed.Yopo contains various tryptamine derivatives as thepsychoactive principle. Bufotenine, once thought to bein the material, is apparently not involved. One of themore pronounced symptoms of hallucination is seeingpeople and other objects upside down.AYAHUASCA\"I had scarcely dispatched one cup of the nauseousbeverage, which is but half the dose, when the rulerof the feast -- desirous, apparently, that I should tasteall his delicacies at once -- came up with a womanbearing a large calabash of caxiri (mandioca beer), ofwhich I must needs take a copious draught, and as Iknew the mode of its preparation, it was gulped downwith secret loathing. Scarcely had I accomplished thisfeat when a large cigar, 2 feet long and a thick as thewrist, was put lighted into my hand, and etiquettedemanded that I should take a few whiffs of it -- Iwho had never in my life smoked a cigar or a pipe oftobacco. Above all this, I must drink a large cup ofpalm-wine, and it will readily be understood that theeffect of such a complex dose was a strong inclinationto vomit, which was only overcome by lying down ina hammock and drinking a cup of coffee which thefriend who accompanied me had taken the precautionto prepare beforehand.\"\"In two minutes or less after drinking it, its effectsbegin to be apparent. The Indian turns deadly pale,trembles in every limb, and horror is in his aspect.Suddenly contrary symptoms succeed; he bursts intoa perspiration, and seems possessed with recklessfury, seizes whatever arms are at hand ... and rushesto the doorway, where he inflicts violent blows on theground.... In about ten minutes the excitement haspassed off, and the Indian grows calm, but perhapsexhausted. Were he at home in his hut, he wouldsleep off the remaining fumes, but now he must shakeoff his drowsiness by renewing the dance.\" [RichardSpruce, noted explorer of South America]\"My own experiences from participation in manyAmazonian Banisteriopsis rituals might be summarizedby saying that the intoxication began with a feeling ofgiddiness and nervousness, soon followed by nausea,occasional vomiting and profuse perspiration.Occasionally, the vision was disturbed by flashes oflight and, upon closing the eyes, a bluish hazesometimes appeared. A period of abnormal lassitudethen set in during which colours increased in intensity.Sooner or later a deep sleep interrupted by dream-likesequences began. The only uncomfortable after-effectnoted was intestinal upset and diarrhoea on thefollowing day. At no time was movement of limbsadversely affected. In fact, amongst many AmazonianIndians, dancing forms part of the caapi-ritual.\"  [Richard Evans Schultes]' ' ' ' 'Ayahuasca, also called caapi and yaj\u00e9, is apsychoactive drink made by the Indians of thewestern Amazon region. One of the earliest writtenaccounts of the use of ayahuasca is that ofVillavicencio. He reported that the drink helped theIndians to decipher enemy war plans, to formulatereplies to ambassadors in matters of war and peace,to interpret illness, and to help young men endure thephysical pain associated with certain initiations intomanhood.Ayahuasca is the bark of Banisteriopsis caapi and B.inebrians, sometimes fortified with the bark of B.rusbyana. These plants belong to Malpighiaceae, afamily little known to us in North America. As with somany of the South American preparations, variousadditives are often included. These confuse theethnobotanist and chemist and delay a trueunderstanding of the formulae used.The effects of caapi are an early feeling ofnervousness and giddiness, sometimes nausea andvomiting, profuse perspiration, and flashes of lightbefore the eyes. There follows a deep sleep withhallucinations. Early chemical work by Fischer-Cardenas isolated an alkaloid called telepathine. Morerecent work shows the active principle to be anotheralkaloid, harmine, and perhaps harmaline.OLOLIUQUIThe early Spanish historians reported the use ofhallucinogenic seeds by Aztec priests who used themas an analgesic. They were commonly employedbefore making sacrifices on mountain tops and whencommunication with the gods was required. Todaythese morning glory seeds may be the most widelyused hallucinogen of the Mexican Indians. Untilrecently, their use was relatively unknown outsideethnobotanical circles.The identity of ololiuqui remained in doubt for about400 years. Crude drawings and descriptions gave thestrong impression that the plant was a member of themorning glory family. Other experts suggested that itmight be the \"sacred datura,\" Datura inoxia. InMexico, botanists and anthropologists working on theproblem believed that the plant was Rivea corymbosa(now called Turbina corymbosa). In 1939, RichardSchultes found it growing next to the doorway of aZapotec witch-doctor in Oaxaca. This was notaccepted as sufficient proof of the identity of ololiuqui-217-until Albert Hofmann (the discoverer of LSD-25)isolated lysergic acid derivatives from the seeds.Since that time, McDougall discovered the use ofIpomoea violacea in conjunction with or as asubstitute for Rivea. This has helped to clear up someof the botanical confusion.-218-SECTION 12 ! ETHNOBOTANICAL STUDIES12.1 ! AN OVERVIEW' Many of the early ethnobotanical studies weresimple in concept. Which plants did a particularpeople use and how did they use them?' The techniques and methodology used in modernstudies are much more sophisticated, showingvery clearly their dependence on other disciplinesin the natural and social sciences.' Controversy continues as to the focus ofethnobotanical research. Is it just the study of\u201cprimitive\u201d peoples?' To what extent do intellectual property rightsextend to the fruits of ethnobotanical research?' What is a fair compensation to a people whoseknowledge translates into a multi-million dollarproduct, such as a new medicine?' More than ever, there is a sense of urgency.Everyone has heard of endangered species. Whatabout \u201cendangered knowledge?\u201d12.2 ! GOALS &TECHNIQUES\u201cThe best ethnobotanist would be a member of anethnic minority who, trained in both botany andanthropology, would study ... the traditionalknowledge, cultural significance, and the managementand uses of the flora. And it would be even better --for him and his people -- if his study could result ineconomic and cultural benefits for his owncommunity.\u201d  (A. Barrera)\u201cOur challenge is to salvage some of the native ... lorebefore it becomes forever entombed with the culturesthat gave it birth.\u201d (Richard Evans Schultes)' ' ' ' 'We have looked at the scope of economic botany orethnobotany, its history, the domestication of plants,exploration for useful ones, and the plantsthemselves, grouped by how they are used. Thepurpose of this section is to introduce you to howethnobotanical studies are carried out and in the\u201cSelected References\u201d section to show a reasonablycomprehensive  list of the published results of thisresearch.RELATED DISCIPLINESTo a considerable degree, ethnobotany is not a standalone discipline. In other words, much of theinformation that it  uses, and the analyticalapproaches that it employs are those of otherscientific disciplines. They include traditional botany(especially taxonomy), pharmacology, anthropology,archeology, ecology, economics, and linguistics.GOALS OF RESEARCHThe early studies were rather straightforward: how dothe people of tribe X use plant Y for purpose Z. Thosecarrying out the studies tended to be from Europe orNorth America; those studied were often located inremote, poorly known parts of the world. They werecharacterized as primitive, unlettered, non-industrialized, and non-urbanized.The earlier procedure of simply preparing a list or acatalogue of useful plants no longer satisfiesethnobotanical enquiry. Current research ischaracterized by the diversity of its research stylesand its objectives.\u201cContemporary ethnobotany examines the dynamicinterdependencies between humans and plants,recognizing that plants permeate materially,symbolically, and metaphorically every aspect ofculture and that nature is by no means passive tohuman actions. The subject matter of ethnobotanyencompasses traditional primitives and prehistoricpeople as well as literate societies, acknowledging thatwe have much to learn about our society\u2019s folk botanyquite apart from the economic botany of modernindustry and agrobusiness.... Thus, ethnobotany ismore than simply an examination of plants useful tonon-Western people, for it is devoted tounderstanding the limitations and behavioralconsequences of human actions on their botanicalenvironment.\u201d  (Ford, 1981)QUESTIONS THAT NEED ASKINGAlcorn (1995) suggested the following:' Which plants are available?' Why are they available?' What factors cause a plant to be viewed as aresource?' How is knowledge distributed in the population?' What do the people think about plants?' How do they differentiate and classify elements intheir environment?' From which resource zone(s) are plantsharvested?' How are they used?' What economic/financial benefits are derived?-219-' How are the plant populations managed?' What is the effect of this management on the localvegetation and on local institutions?' How have human activities influenced theevolution of local plants?KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMSIn carrying out ethnobotanical research, it is importantto realize that although all cultures have studied thenatural world around them, they have done so usingdifferent values and approaches. The followingcomparison of knowledge systems is based on thework of Johnson (1992). While useful in drawing apoint by point contrast between two world views, Isuspect that our scientific methods of conductingethnobotanical research have been modified in recentyears as the result of a better understanding of howtraditional knowledge of plants and their uses isgenerated.TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS' All parts of natural world regarded as animate; alllife forms as interdependent' Knowledge transmitted largely through oral media' Knowledge developed and acquired throughobservation and practical experience' Knowledge is holistic, intuitive, qualitative, andpractical' Knowledge generated by resource users on a long-term time scale' Nature and status of particular knowledgeinfluenced by sociocultural factors, such asspiritual beliefs, and communally held' Explanations behind perceived phenomena oftenspiritually-based and subjective' Knowledge used to make suitable decisions undervariable conditionsWESTERN SCIENTIFIC SYSTEMS' Human life generally regarded as superior, withmoral right to control other life forms' Knowledge transmitted largely through writtenword' Knowledge generally learned in situation remotefrom its applied context' Knowledge essentially reductionist, quantitative,analytical, and theoretical' Knowledge generated largely by specialists on ashort term time scale' Nature and status of particular knowledgeinfluenced by peer review, and held by individuals' Explanations behind perceived phenomenaessentially rational and objective' Knowledge used to put forward hypotheses and toverify underlying laws or constants.-220-SECTION 13 ! PLANTS BY GROUP/FAMILYThis list began as a updating and expansion of oneprepared by Albert F. Hill (1952) for his introductorytextbook in economic botany... and, I\u2019m afraid it justgot out of hand!  I also thought it would be useful toadd a brief description of how the plant is used andwhat part yields the product. There are a number ofmore or less encyclopedic references on this subject.The number of plants and the details of their uses aresimply overwhelming. In the list below, I haveattempted to focus on plants that are of directeconomic importance to us, and to present them bygroups or families. I have not included ornamentals,weeds, and toxic plants (unless we knowingly usethem to kill something or someone). The variousdictionaries of economic plants also include, on a hit-and-miss basis, plants that are sometimes eaten onlylocally or that have been used medicinally in somefashion. I have included only those food plants thatenjoy wider use and those medicinal plants that havedemonstrated properties. There is an emphasis onplants of the New World.The listing of nonvascular plants, ferns, and their alliesis short enough to scan quickly to find a particularplant. The much more extensive coverage of floweringplants is arranged by plant family.If you are not familiar with their technical names, lookat the end of this section for assistance.
