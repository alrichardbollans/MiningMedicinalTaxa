Moreover, many of the modern pharmaceuticals were developedfrom molecules extracted from natural sources, and medicinal plants still today represent animportant pool for the identification of novel drug leads.The ethnopharmacological tradition in Central and Eastern Europe has a great historicalsignificance and large parts of the Western world\u2019s knowledge for therapeutic properties ofmedicinal plants has its roots in the Greek and Roman cultures (e.g., with a reference to theinfluential works of Dioscorides, Pliny the Elder, and Galen). The German-speaking CentralEuropean areas also have played very important roles, with some influential medieval herbalbook editions such as the Mainz Herbal (Herbarius Moguntinus, 1484) and The German Herbal(1485). Moreover, at the beginning of the nineteenth century modern drug discovery from plantsstarted to played a key role in Central Europe, most notably the work of the German apothecaryassistant Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner, who isolated an analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium thatwas named morphium (morphine) after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. At the same time,it should be noted that on many occasions the rich ethnopharmacological knowledge of someEast European countries and Russia remained localized and did not find its way to integrate withthe Western world of herbal therapy traditions. The focus of this Research Topic is to make aspecial contribution to ethnopharmacology rooted in Central and Eastern Europe, on the contextof global research developments in the area of ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, molecularpharmacology of natural products, nutrigenomics, and other related disciplines. This special issueconsists of 24 articles covering diverse topics related to the listed research fields.Advances in screeningmethods and analytical equipment, increasing number of targets availablefor testing, and improved possibilities for optimization of natural leads using syntheticmodification6Tewari et al. Central and Eastern European Ethnopharmacologystrategies substantially improved the process of moderndrug discovery from natural sources (Atanasov et al., 2015).Hypericum is a well-known genus that is used for its medicinalproperties. Tocci et al. evaluated five Hypericum species fortheir polyphenolic content, toxicological safety, and antifungalpotential against some sensitive and drug resistant clinicalfungal isolates. The authors have identified 52 compoundsby LC-MS analysis and showed that H. hircinum subsp.majus infusion exerted broad antifungal activity againstAspergillus, Penicillium, and non-albicans Candida strains(Tocci et al.).Ethnobotany has played an important role in new drugdevelopment and drug discovery (Kayser, 2018). The importanceof the traditional use of medicinal plants on the Greek islands ofthe North Aegean Region was summarized in a Brief ResearchReport Article by Axiotis et al. In this report the authors present109 wild plants from 52 families, and enlist their therapeutic uses,including uses in galenic preparations which were reported bylocal medical doctors and pharmacists (Axiotis et al.).Medicinal plants and natural products are of potentialimportance in several age-related disorders, including memoryimpairment and dementia (Tewari et al., 2018). In this researchtopic Dimpfel et al. assessed the biological activity of somecommercial extracts of the underground parts of Rhodiola roseaL. and its analytical markers, salidroside and rosavin, using long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in hippocampus slices(a synaptic model of memory).Loeser et al. evaluated the effect of Casperome R\u00a9, an orallybioavailable soy lecithin-based formulation of standardizedfrankincense extract on various systemic parameters and organdamages that were induced by severe systemic inflammationcaused by intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharides(a murine model of sepsis). The study revealed that the extractpossesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and hepatoprotectiveeffects (Loeser et al.).Zielin\u00b4ska et al. review older and recent data on pharmacology,phytochemistry, and clinical studies of Chelidonium majus L.along with controversies about this herb, its safety, and drugquality issues.The study of Wozniak et al. evaluated the effects ofphytochemically characterized extracts of various parts oftraditionally used Syringa vulgaris L. (common lilac) on thepro-inflammatory functions of neutrophils. The authors alsoisolated active compounds, including neooleuropein from theextracts using bioassay-guided fractionation. It was found thatneooleuropein acts through inhibition of cytokine production byattenuation of the MAP kinase pathways (Woz\u00b4niak et al.).Smooth muscle cells are a prominent target of diverse naturalproducts with different bioactivities (Hnatyszyn et al., 2003;Uhrin et al., 2018). S\u00e1ndor et al. assessed the relaxant effectsor contracting activity of the hydroethanolic extract, fractions,phytoconstituents, and essential oil of Roman chamomile onsmoothmuscle preparations. The authors found that the essentialoil of the plant possessed a good smooth muscle-relaxant effect(S\u00e1ndor et al.).Identification of the molecular mechanism of action ofpromising natural products is a vital step toward theirclinical application (Butler, 2008; Tewari et al., 2018). In amechanistic study, Celin\u00b4ska-Janowicz et al. studied the apoptosis-inducing mechanisms of selected propolis components in tonguesquamous cell carcinoma cells (CAL-27). In another work,Grienke et al. isolated several flavonoids and rare sesquiterpenelactones from the ethanolic extract of Centaurea ragusina L., aplant species endemic to Croatia. For the first time they identifiedragusinin, and hemistepsin A from this genus. The authorsfurther studied the mechanism underlining the ragusinin activityin cancer cells (Grienke et al.).In their review article Kozlowska et al. summarize the herbalmedicines used in the Beskid mountain ranges, which are locatedsouth of Krakow and Lviv, two important medieval centers ofapothecary tradition in the area. In another interesting reviewKunnumakkara et al. summarize potential benefits, traditionaluses, chemistry, biological activities, and clinical trials of \u201cguggul\u201dfrom Commiphora and Boswellia.Berberine is an important phytoconstituent of plants utilizedin different traditional medicine systems, including the Chinesesystem of traditional medicine (Huang et al., 2011). In their work\u201cBerberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, ExtractionMethods, and Relevance in Cardiovascular, Metabolic, Hepatic,and Renal Disorders\u201d Neag et al. review diverse biomedicalinformation on berberine, including several chromatographictechniques for berberine extraction and quantification.There is great interest of the scientific community towardthe health benefits of food items used in the Mediterraneandiet, which has a variety of health benefits (Sofi et al., 2010).Wang et al. review recent studies on pomegranate, mainlyfocusing on vasculoprotective effects attributed to diversepomegranate phytoconstituents, including tannins, especiallyellagitannins, and ellagic acid, among other compounds.Lycopene is a carotenoid which is responsible for differentpigmentation in tomatoes, grapefruit, and watermelon, and itrepresents a compound with a potent antioxidant action (Horvitzet al., 2004). In their work, Mozos et al. review mechanismsof action of lycopene on the vascular system consideringsubstantial epidemiological and experimental data, andclinical studies.Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women andrepresents a global health burden both in the developed anddeveloping countries. Hong et al. study apigenin and luteolin tobetter understand their mechanism of action in the context ofbreast cancer intravasation of the lymphatic barrier. Both of thesenatural compounds were evaluated in a three-dimensional assaysystem containing MDA-MB231 breast cancer spheroids andimmortalized lymph endothelial cell monolayers (Hong et al.)Toiu et al. evaluated the chemical composition, antimicrobial,antioxidant, and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of variousextracts of the aerial parts of an important plant species withtraditional use in Romanian, Ajuga laxmannii (Murray) Benth.In their work, Shikov et al. review 70 wild plant species thatare referenced in the 11th edition of the State Pharmacopeia ofthe USSR and also discuss their health food value, mainly basedon published Russian literature.Marchelak et al. present a comprehensive study focusedon extracts of the flowers of Prunus spinosa L. The authorsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 3417Tewari et al. Central and Eastern European Ethnopharmacologyprofiled the phenolic contents of the extracts throughUHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS3, and also studied several biologicaleffects with relevance in the context of cardiovascular disease(Marchelak et al.).Chowdhury et al. explore the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic potential of various extracts of the medicinal plantcolocynth. The authors have found that ethanol and acetoneextracts of colocynth fruit pulp exhibit promising activity indifferent cancer cell types, inhibiting viability, and cell migrationin association with the modulation of the expression of diverserelevant genes and cellular pathways (Chowdhury et al.).Ononis natrix is a member of the Fabaceae family and is a less-explored plant species. In their work, Yerlikaya et al. give newinsight on the chemical composition and biological activities ofOnonis natrix subsp. hispanica.Wang et al. identify and characterize the natural productfalcarindiol as a novel inducer of macrophage cholesterol e\ufb04ux,a process with a protective effect in atherosclerosis.In their research paper, Raclariu et al. establish DNAmetabarcoding and HPLC-MS techniques for the authenticationof Veronica officinalis L. herbal products. The authors advocatefor the use of an integrative approach for the detection ofadulteration and substitution in the herbal products (Raclariuet al.).L\u00f3pez et al. study the effects of lavender essential oil onpharmacological targets that are involved in anti-depressive andanxiolytic effects, as well as on in vitromodels of neurotoxicity.Lewenhofer et al. performed an activity-guided identificationof active principles from Scrophularia lucida L. using cancer cellmodels. The authors identified 14 substances including some veryrare iridoids, like scrovalentinoside or koelzioside, and flavonoidssuch as nepitrin and homoplantaginin (Lewenhofer et al..)In conclusion, this Research Topic includes a wide range ofinterdisciplinary research work contributing to the ultimate goalsof augmenting the existing knowledge and fostering the scientificfield of ethnopharmacology in Central and Eastern Europe,as well as globally. This research topic successfully gatheredcomprehensive interdisciplinary information in the field ofethnopharmacology from the field surveys to standardizationand elucidation of molecular mechanisms of action of naturalproducts. Moreover, with consideration of the existing challengesin the field of drug discovery formmedicinal plants, this researchtopic provides up-to-date snapshot of current knowledge andpaves the way for further chemical and biological assessment ofdiverse natural compounds with potential for future therapeuticdevelopment. We hope that this compendiumwill further inspirescientists from different research fields to make use of thegathered traditional medical knowledge in the search for superiorfuture remedies from nature.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectualcontribution to the work, and approved it for publication.REFERENCESAtanasov, A.

In several chromatographic steps,three flavonoids and three sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) were isolated and identifiedfrom the most active fractions of the ethanol extract. Two STLs, one for which wecreated the trivial name ragusinin, and hemistepsin A are here reported for the firsttime as constituents of the genus Centaurea. All six compounds were screened fortheir effect on several tumor and one normal cell lines. Among them, ragusinin showedthe best bioactivity and high specificity to affect tumor murine SCCVII, human HeLaand Caco-2 cell lines, but not the viability of normal V79 fibroblasts. Due to thesecharacteristics the action of ragusinin was investigated in more detail. Since DNA isthe primary target for many drugs with antibacterial and anticancer activity, we studiedits interaction with ragusinin. Rather moderate binding affinity to DNA excluded it asthe primary target of ragusinin. Due to the possibility of STL interaction with glutathione(GSH), the ubiquitous peptide that traps reactive compounds and other xenobiotics toprevent damage to vital proteins and nucleic acids, its role in deactivation of ragusininwas evaluated. Addition of the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine potentiated the viabilityof HeLa cells, while the addition of GSH inhibitor L-buthionine sulfoximine decreasedit. Moreover, pre-treatment of HeLa cells with the inhibitor of glutathione-S-transferasedecreased their viability indicating the detoxifying role of GSH in ragusinin treated cells.Cell death, derived by an accumulation of cells in a G2 phase of the cell cylce, wasshown to be independent of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3 cleavagepointing toward an alternative cell death pathway.Keywords: Centaurea, sesquiterpene lactones, DNA, cell viability, toxicity, glutathioneFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 9729fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 2Grienke et al. Centaurea ragusina L. Isolates\u2019 BioactivityINTRODUCTIONThe genus Centaurea (Asteraceae) represents an attractivesource for bioactive secondary metabolites such as sesquiterpenelactones (STLs), flavonoids, lignans, and their glycosides(Khammar and Djeddi, 2012). A number of therapeutic effectsagainst microbial infections, gastrointestinal disorders, andurogenital ailments have been attributed to Centaurea species inCroatian folk medicine and worldwide (Pahlow, 1989; Ayad et al.,2012; Politeo et al., 2012).Our recent study on the phytochemical and bioactive profileof non-volatile constituents of Centaurea ragusina L., an endemicCroatian halophytic species (Radic\u00b4 et al., 2013), indicated thestrong potential for obtaining bioactive compounds from the leafethanol extract (CRE) (Vujc\u02c7ic\u00b4 et al., 2017).In continuation of this previous study, the aim was toinvestigate the biological activity of all isolated compounds,namely the interaction with DNA, the antibacterial activityagainst Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii) (Lee et al., 2007;C\u00b4urkovic\u00b4-Perica et al., 2015) and anticancer activity against apanel of murine and human cancer cells.Due to its high biological significance, DNA is the primarytarget for many drugs with antibacterial and anticancer activity.Small organic molecules can bind to DNA by means of anon-specific, electrostatic binding along the DNA backbone, aspecific groove binding and intercalation or can form crosslinkswith DNA strands and induce cleavage of the DNA backbone(Demeunynck et al., 2002; Sangeetha Gowda et al., 2014).STLs are known to bind covalently to sulfhydryl groups ofenzymes and other functional proteins by Michael type additionof their electrophilic \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl structures. It isbelieved that most of STL biological effects are due to theirreaction with biological nucleophiles such as GSH (Kupchanet al., 1971; Picman, 1986; Schmidt, 1999). Among many roles ofGSH in the cell, the most important one seems to be the removalof reactive species and elimination of xenobiotic compounds. Thelast one can be accomplished through conjugation with GSHfollowed by secretion of adducts from the cell (Boyland andChasseaud, 1969).Here, the aim was to study the activity of the most bioactivecompound in more detail, which included the interaction withDNA as the potential primary target and the interaction withGSH and its impact on cytotoxicity, cell cycle and cell death.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll safety precautions were taken when working with chemicalsreagents used in the experiments.General Experimental Procedures1D and 2D NMR experiments were performed on an Avance500 MHz instrument equipped with cryoprobe (Bruker,Billerica, MA, United States). The samples were measured inMeOD and DMSO-d6, respectively (calibrated to the residualnon-deuterated solvent signals). HR-ESI-MS analyses wereperformed on a maXis HD ESI-Qq-TOF mass spectrometer(Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The ESI ion source wasoperated as follows: capillary voltage: 2.0 to 4.5 kV (individuallyoptimized), nebulizer: 0.4 bar (N2), dry gas flow: 4 L min\u22121 (N2)and dry temperature: 200\u25e6C, scanning range, m/z 50\u20131550. Foreach isolated compound, fragment ion spectra of the [M+H]+,the [M+Na]+ and either the [M-H] \u2212 or the [M+HCOO]\u2212 ionwere recorded. The sum formulas of the ions were determinedusing Bruker Compass DataAnalysis 4.2 based on the massaccuracy (1m/z \u2264 2 ppm for MS1 and\u2264 3 ppm for MS/MS) andisotopic pattern matching (SmartFormula algorithm).Column chromatography (CC) was performed usingMerck silica gel 60 (40\u201363 \u00b5m) and Pharmacia SephadexLH-20 (20\u2013100 \u00b5m). The fractions obtained from allchromatographic steps were analyzed by TLC (mobile phase:CH2Cl2-EtOAc (85:15), n-hexane-EtOAc-CH3COOH (6:3:1),or n-hexane-EtOAc (8:2); stationary phase: Merck silica gel60 PF254, detected with staining reagents vanillin/H2SO4 atvis, UV254, and UV366). HPLC was performed on a ShimadzuUFLC-XR instrument (Kyoto, Japan) with a photodiode arraydetector (DAD). LC-parameters: stationary phase: PhenomenexGemini-NX (C18), 150 mm \u00d7 3.00 mm, 5 \u00b5m; temperature:35\u25e6C; mobile phase: water with 0.1% formic acid (A); acetonitrile(B); flow rate 0.4 mL/min; UV detection wavelength: 275 nm;injection volume: 10 \u00b5L; gradient: 80/20 A/B in 5 min to 70/30A/B, then within 20 min to 50/50 A/B and within another 2 minto 2/98, followed by a 5 min column wash (2A/98B) and are-equilibration period of 10 min. All chemicals and solventsused were of analytical grade.Plant MaterialCentaurea ragusina L. plants (in vegetative phase) were collectedin September, 2016, from two wild habitats \u2013 Katalinic\u00b4 brig(43\u25e630\u203203\u2032\u2032N, 16\u25e626\u203240\u2032\u2032E, 363 m) and Sustipan (43\u25e630\u203204\u2032\u2032N,16\u25e625\u203235\u2032\u2032E, 754 m), Split, Croatia and identified by M.

Fraction E9 (26.9 mg) wasfurther separated by means of a Sephadex LH-20 column (mobilephase: MeOH) to give three fractions (F1\u20133). Fraction F2 wasobtained as 21.8 mg of compound 5 [(3aR,4S,6aR,8S,9aR,9bR)-[dodecahydro-8-dihydroxy-3,6,9-tris(methylene)-2oxo-2(3H)-azuleno[4,5-b]furanyl]-3-methyl-butanoate].Fraction A8 (834.3 mg) was separated via a SephadexLH-20 column (mobile phase: MeOH) giving seven fractions(G1-7). Fraction G7 was obtained as 80.3 mg of compound3 (hispidulin). Fraction G4 (339.4 mg) was submitted topassage over a Sephadex LH-20 column (mobile phase: CH2Cl2-acetone, 85:15) to yield twelve fractions (H1-12). Fraction H10(251.4 mg) was further separated using silica gel CC (Mercksilica gel 60 PF254, 150 g; 1.5 cm \u00d7 56 cm) applying againa gradient system of n-hexane-EtOAc-CH3COOH (6:3:1 to4:5:1) to yield ten fractions (I1-10). Fraction I9 (185.8 mg)was subjected to a Sephadex LH-20 column (mobile phase:MeOH) resulting in three fractions (J1-3). Fraction J1 (17.8 mg)was purified by silica gel CC (Merck silica gel 60 PF254,50 g; 1.5 cm \u00d7 35 cm) applying again a gradient system ofCH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH to yield two fractions (K1-2).

Fraction L2 (115.7 mg) was separated via a SephadexLH-20 column (mobile phase: MeOH) giving two fractions(M1-2). Fraction M2 was obtained as 12.7 mg of compound 6(hemistepsin A).The physical and spectroscopic data of compounds 1 to 6agreed with those published previously for chrysin, oroxylinA, hispidulin, deacylcynaropicrin, [3aR,4S,6aR,8S,9aR,9bR)-[dodecahydro-8-dihydroxy-3,6,9-tris(methylene)-2oxo-2(3H)-azuleno[4,5-b]furanyl]-3-methyl-butanoate], and hemistepsin A(Miyase et al., 1985; Zdero et al., 1989; Jang et al., 1999; Nagaoet al., 2002; Marques et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013). Their puritywas checked using TLC and LC-MS and revealed to be > 98% inall cases.Spectroscopic Experiments for theDetermination of ctDNA InteractionsThe electronic absorption spectra (UV/Vis) were recorded on aVarian Cary 100 Bio spectrophotometer (Agilent, Santa Clara,CA, United States) and circular dichroism (CD) spectra on aJASCO J815 spectrophotometer (ABL&E Handels GmbH, Wien,Austria) at 25\u25e6C using appropriate 1 cm path quartz cuvettes(Eriksson and Nord\u00e9n, 2001). The calf thymus DNA (ctDNA)was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Isothermal titrationcalorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed on a MicroCalVP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA,United States) (Chaires, 2006). Origin 7.0 software, suppliedby the manufacturer was used for data analysis. All additionaldata of these experiments are provided in the SupplementaryMaterial.Antibacterial AssayAntibacterial activities of C. ragusina L. CRE extract, fractionsand isolated compounds against Gram-negative A. baumanniiDurn (C\u00b4urkovic\u00b4-Perica et al., 2015) and Gram-positive S. aureusATCC 25923 were tested using modified Clinical and LaboratoryStandards Institute (CLSI), broth microdilution (BD) using2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Lee et al., 2007). TheTTC-BD were performed according to the guidelines of theCLSI using 96-well microplates (Clinical Laboratory StandardsInstitute [CLSI], 2007). The bacteria were grown on nutrientagar (Biolife, Milan, Italy) for 16 h at 36 \u00b1 0.1\u25e6C to obtainthe cultures in log phase of growth. The bacterial biomass wasthen suspended in sterile NaCl (0.85% v/v) to give turbidityequivalent to the McFarland 0.5 standard. Bacterial suspension(0.1 mL) was transferred to a tube containing 9.1 mL nutrientbroth (Biolife) and 0.8 mL 0.05% TTC to give an inoculumdensity of 1 \u00d7 106 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/mL. Minimuminhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidalconcentration (MBC) values were determined in triplicates. Thefinal concentrations for MIC and MBC determination of sampleswere 1.9\u20134000 \u00b5g/mL. Other data on antibacterial experimentsare available in the Supplementary Material.Cytotoxicity Assays and Cell DeathAnalysisCrystal Violet (CV) AssayMurine melanoma (B16F10) cell lines, human colon carcinoma(Caco-2) and human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines werepurchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,Manassas, VA, United States), murine fibrosarcoma (FsaR) andmurine squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) cell lines wereobtained from BC Cancer Research Centre (Vancouver, Canada).Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2,at 37 \u25e6C in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). As normal cellline, the V79 fibroblasts derived from hamster\u2019s lung tissue,were used.

Isolates\u2019 Bioactivitymonolayer culture in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium(DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 10% (FBS;Sigma-Aldrich) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u25e6Cand were sub-cultured every 3\u20134 days. Cytotoxic activity of theSTL 5 was determined by MTT assay, an assay for assessing cellviability based on its metabolic activity, modified accordingly(Mickisch et al., 1990; also in Supplementary Material).Cell Cycle and Cell Death AnalysisHeLa cells were seeded into tissue culture plates and treatedwith different concentrations of the compound during 72 h.Thereafter, both adherent and floating cells were collected,washed with PBS and fixed overnight in 70% ethanol at \u201320\u25e6C. Fixed cells were treated with RNase A (0.1 mg/mL,Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature and afterwardstained with propidium iodide (PI; 50 \u00b5g/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) for30 min in the dark. In order to analyze the cell cycle progression,the DNA content and PI staining were detected by flow cytometry(FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, United States).Data were analyzed with ModFit LTTM program (Verity SoftwareHouse Inc., Topsham, ME, United States).Twenty-four hours after the seeding, HeLa cells were treatedwith 2, 5, and 10 \u00b5M of compound 5. After 48 h, bothadherent and floating cells were collected by centrifugation andthen washed with PBS. The cell suspension was incubated withAnnexin V (BD Biosciences; according to producer\u2019s protocol)and PI (5 \u00b5g/mL, Sigma-Aldrich). Upon 30 min incubation atroom temperature in the dark, the viable, early apoptotic, lateapoptotic/necrotic, and necrotic cell populations were detectedand counted by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Data wereanalyzed with ModFit LTTM program (Verity Software HouseInc.).In addition, the specific markers of programmed cell deathwere determined, cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1(PARP) and caspase-3, by western blot as described previously(Brozovic et al., 2013). In short, the 2 h incubation atroom temperature with monoclonal anti-PARP (Santa CruzBiotechnology) and polyclonal anti-caspase-3 (anti-Cas-3;Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, United States)antibodies was performed. After washing with 0.01% Tween20 in PBS and incubation with the corresponding horseradishperoxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham PharmaciaBiotech, Munich, Germany), proteins were visualized withECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to themanufacturer\u2019s protocol. All membranes were incubated withanti-extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (anti-ERK1/2)(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody to confirm equal proteinloading. ERK1/2 was used as loading controls since no changesin total ERK1/2 expression were detected upon exposure ofcells to different drugs (Brozovic et al., 2004; Herraiz et al.,2011).Determination of Glutathione FunctionThe function of intracellular GSH in cell response to STL 5was investigated by MTT assay. HeLa cells were either pre-treated overnight with a specific inhibitor, 0.001 mM BSO orfor 2 h with a precursor in GSH synthesis, 5 mM NAC. Bothcompounds are frequently used in the manipulation of GSHlevel in the cells (Trachootham et al., 2009; Kannan et al.,2014). Upon pre-treatment with either BSO or NAC, differentconcentrations of STL 5 were added and the cytotoxicity effectof the compounds was determined 72 h later as describedabove.The capacity of GSH to form the detoxification conjugatesthrough enzymatic reaction with STL 5 was investigated bypretreatment of HeLa cells with of 5 \u00b5g/mL ETA for 2 h andthen with different concentrations of STL 5. The cell survivalwas examined 72 h after. The optimal concentrations of usedmodulators of GSH synthesis and glutathione S-transferasereaction were determined previously (Osmak and Eljuga, 1993;Brozovic et al., 2008; Brozovic et al., 2013).Statistical AnalysisAll results were evaluated using the software package Statistica12.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, United States). Results were subjectedto one-way ANOVA for comparison of means and significantdifferences were calculated according to Duncan\u2019s multiple rangetest. Data were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.Different letters indicate significant difference at P < 0.05.RESULTSSelection of Plant Material, Extraction,Fractionation, and First BioactivityAssessmentAs a starting point for phytochemical investigations, an ethanolC. ragusina L. leaf extract (CRE) was prepared to obtain amulticomponent mixture embracing a wide range of secondarymetabolites (Figure 1).In antibacterial assays, CRE showed moderate antibacterialeffects against S. aureus with MIC of 500 \u00b5g/mL and MBC of2000\u00b5g/mL, respectively, and weak activity against A. baumanniiwith MIC and MBC values both of > 4000 \u00b5g/mL, respectively(Vujc\u02c7ic\u00b4 et al., 2017).In contrast to the moderate antibacterial activity, CREexhibited significant effects on all tested murine melanoma(B16F10), squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) fibrosarcoma(FsaR) cell lines and normal hamster fibroblasts (V79).At a CRE concentration of 60 \u00b5g/mL, the cell survivalrelative to the negative control was \u2264 10% for V79 fibroblasts,SCCVII and FsaR, respectively, and 21% for the B16F10. CREdid not show selective cytotoxicity between murine cancer andnormal cell lines, which may be a consequence of a cumulativeeffect of different bioactive compounds included in the crudeextract.For a more focused isolation process of the bioactiveconstituents of the crude extract, twelve fractions (A1\u2013A12)obtained by separation of CRE via silica gel chromatographywere retested in the mentioned cell lines, revealing A6 and A8as fractions with the strongest cytotoxic activity. Both fractions(60 \u00b5g/mL) exhibited stronger cytotoxic activity on B16F10(< 10% cell survival) and SCCVII (\u2264 20% cell survival) cellFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97212fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 5Grienke et al.

Based on these results,fractions A6 and A8, were selected for further chromatographicseparations.Isolation and Identification of PureCompoundsSix constituents were isolated from CRE fractions A6 and A8 byseparation techniques including CC and preparative thin layerchromatography.By using HR-ESI-MS analyses and NMR experiments,and by comparison with earlier studies (Miyase et al.,1985; Zdero et al., 1989; Jang et al., 1999; Nagao et al.,2002; Marques et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013), the isolates(Figure 2) were identified as chrysin (1), oroxylin A (2),hispidulin (3), deacylcynaropicrin (4), (3aR,4S,6aR,8S,9aR,9bR)-[dodecahydro-8-dihydroxy-3,6,9-tris(methylene)-2oxo-2(3H)-azuleno[4,5-b]furanyl]-3-methyl-butanoate (5), andhemistepsin A (6). Instead of using the complicated and longsystematic name for compound 5, we created the trivialname ragusinin. The flavonoids (1\u20133) can be classifiedas flavones, whereby different substitution patterns withmethoxy or hydroxy groups can be observed on C-6 andC-4\u2032. Compounds 4\u20136 are STLs belonging to the subtype ofguajanolides.FIGURE 2 | Chemical structures of isolated C. ragusina L. leaf constituents.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97213fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 6Grienke et al. Centaurea ragusina L. Isolates\u2019 BioactivityCompound 1 is a frequently occurring flavone reported as aconstituent of several Centaurea species (Mouffok et al., 2012).However, we are reporting here for the first time its isolationfrom C. ragusina L. Different bioactivities have been reportedfor compound 1. It suppresses inducible nitric oxide synthase,cyclooxygenase-2 expression and inhibits NF-\u03baB activation,which altogether leads to anti-inflammatory effects (Feng et al.,2014). Compound 1 is also reported as a tumor cell growtharrest compound, arresting C6 glioma cells in the G1 phase ofthe cell cycle either through activating p38-MAPK leading tothe accumulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 protein or mediating theinhibition of proteasome activity (Weng et al., 2005). It alsosuppresses tumor growth of anaplastic thyroid cancer ATC cellsboth in vitro and in vivo (Yu et al., 2013).Compound 2 is known as the main component of severalmedicinal plants including Oroxylum indicum (Krueger andGanzera, 2012) and various Centaurea species. However, sofar it has not been reported for C. ragusina L. Compound 2was shown to activate caspase-3 and caspase-9 in human coloncarcinoma HCT-116 cells and decrease tumor volume and weightin immunodeficient mice that were inoculated with HCT-116cells (Hu et al., 2012). It also exhibits anti-inflammatory effectsby decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines mediated by estrogenreceptor activity (Wang et al., 2013).Compound 3 has been isolated from various Centaureaspecies, e.g., C. melitensis L. (Negrete et al., 1989), C. aspera L.(Ferreres et al., 1980), and C. jacea L. (Forgo et al., 2012), butnever from C. ragusina L. It is an important compound used intraditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of liver carcinoma(Gao et al., 2014). Besides an apoptotic effect on human livercancer HepG2 cells, it was also shown that this effect is mediatedvia mitochondrial dysfunction (Gao et al., 2014). Furthermore,an anti-proliferative effect toward human lung cancer A-549 cellswas reported for compound 3 (Zhang et al., 2012).Compound 4 has already been reported as a constituent ofC. ragusina L. (Mahmoud et al., 1986) and other Centaureaspecies with anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity (Gonz\u00e1lezet al., 1977; Sosa et al., 2011).To the best of our knowledge, guajanolides 5 and 6 havenever been identified as constituents from Centaurea speciesbefore. Whereas for 6 an antibacterial and cytotoxic activitytoward human cell lines in the low \u00b5M range has previouslybeen reported (Jang et al., 1999) compound 5 (ragusinin) withits isovalerate residue is a rare STL without reports on bioactivity.Study of Biological Activity (InteractionsWith DNA, Antibacterial and CytotoxicActivity) of C. ragusina L. ConstituentsThe DNA binding affinity of compounds is important to exploresince the DNA represents a well-known target of several broadlyused drugs and the binding to DNA is one of the commoncauses of cell death (Demeunynck et al., 2002; Sangeetha Gowdaet al., 2014). In order to determine the binding affinity of theisolated compounds to ctDNA, UV/Vis spectroscopy and ITC(Bronowska, 2011) were employed (see section \u201cExperimental\u201dand \u201cSupplementary Material for details\u201d). CD was used formonitoring of conformational changes of ctDNA induced bysmall molecule binding and for gaining information about modesof interaction (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980; Johnson, 1994).Among isolated STLs and flavonoids (SupplementaryMaterial), only 5 exhibited significant changes in CD titrations(Supplementary Figure S4). Due to that reason, we decided tocharacterize the binding of DNA only with compound 5. UV/Visspectroscopy was not applicable in the study of DNA-ragusinininteraction due to absorption of STLs at short wavelengths(210\u2013220 nm). Therefore, the binding interaction of 5 withctDNA was monitored by ITC.The ITC experiment of 5 with ctDNA resulted in negativepeaks indicating that the binding process was exothermic(Figure 3). The resulting values were fitted to a single-site bindingmodel by the non-linear least square method yielding rathermoderate binding constant (log Ka = 4.04). The stoichiometry(N) was fixed to 0.5 based on results from CD titration withctDNA (the saturation of binding sites was reached at theratio, r = 0.5, Supplementary Material). The binding of 5 toctDNA was characterized by a positive binding entropy (T1rS/kJmol\u22121 = 18.5) accompanied by smaller negative enthalpy(1rH/kJ mol\u22121 = -4.6) revealing that its binding is entropicallydriven. In many cases, the groove binding is associated withpositive (favorable) binding entropies due to the release ofFIGURE 3 | Calorimetric titration of compound 5 (c = 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 mol dm\u22123)with ctDNA (c = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 mol dm\u22123) in sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0,I = 0.05 mol dm\u22123; T = 25\u25e6C; 1rG/kJ mol\u22121 = -23.0).

However, since thecytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds was more prominentthan the antibacterial, we presented here cytotoxic activity inmore detail while the data on antibacterial activity are availablein the Supplementary Material.Crystal Violet (CV) bioassay, which measures the DNA massof living cells, was used for initial activity screening. The cytotoxiceffect of the isolated compounds 1 to 6 was monitored with theCV test for 24 h at 5 and 10 \u00b5M on a panel of three murineand three human cancer cell lines. 5-Fluorouracil was used asa positive control at equimolar concentrations as the studiedcompounds (Figures 4, 5). The isolated flavonoids 1 and 2 didnot demonstrate cytotoxic activity against the majority of cancercell lines at the applied concentrations. Only compound 3 exerteda noticeable cytotoxic effect against HeLa cells (Figure 4). Amongthe isolated STLs, 5 showed the most prominent cytotoxicactivity. In particular, compound 5 reduced the cell survival ofSCCVII cells to 42% at 10 \u00b5M and 50% at 5 \u00b5M concentration(Figure 5). It also exhibited promising activity against Caco-2cells at 10 \u00b5M and HeLa cells at both concentrations applied(Figure 5). On the other hand, 5 had weak (cell survival was85% at 10 \u00b5M) or no activity (> 95% at 5 \u00b5M) againstnormal fibroblasts (V79). Moreover, while compound 4 did notshow significant cytotoxic effects on any cell line at the appliedconcentrations, compound 6 showed noticeable effects againstSCVII and FsaR cells at 10 \u00b5M.Cytotoxic Activity of Ragusinin (5) inHeLa Cell LineIn order to determine the biological effect of the most activecompound 5 (Figure 5) in more detail, we used MTT assay andHeLa cells as experimental model (Cimbora-Zovko et al., 2011).Ragusinin decreased cell survival of HeLa cells in aconcentration-dependent manner in comparison to untreatedcells (Figure 6). The dose that killed 50% of the cell population(IC50 value) after 72 h of continuous treatment with 5 wasbetween 1.8 and 2.3 \u00b5M (Figure 6).To better understand the mechanism underlying the cellgrowth impairment by 5, the cell cycle progression wasinvestigated. HeLa cells were treated with increasing doses of5 during 48 h. As shown in Figure 7A, compound 5 triggersthe accumulation of HeLa cells in the G2 phase of cell cycle.Moreover, a compound 5 induced dose-dependent increase ofcells in the Sub G1 population indicates a ragusinin-triggered celldeath (Figure 7A). The same was confirmed by treatment of cellswith 10 \u00b5M of 5 during 24\u201372 h. Time-dependent accumulationof HeLa cells in the G2 phase is detectable as well as time-increaseof cells in the Sub G1 phase of the cell cycle (Figure 7B).In order to determine the type of cell death triggered by 5,the cells were treated with increasing doses of the compoundand 48 h later, FACS-Annexin V/PI staining was performed.Our results show a ragusinin-induced dose-dependent apoptosis(Figure 7C). We then performed Western blot analysis of specificcell death markers, PARP and caspase-3 cleavage, followingtreatment with 1.25 and 2.5 \u00b5M of 5 for 24\u201372 h. Theobtained results were interesting since 5 did not induce PARP(Figure 7D) and caspase-3 cleavage (Figure 7E). The assumedcaspase-independent cell death triggered by 5 was in additionconfirmed by measuring the absence of caspase activity 3/7 byCaspase-Glo R\u00a9 3/7 Assay (data not shown). The occurrence ofcaspase and PARP cleavage independent cell death indicatessome alternative cell death pathway described in the literatureto be triggered by a different type of cell stressors (Kroemer andMartin, 2005; Tait and Green, 2008). This is the first example ofcaspase independent cell death described for compound 5.Role of Glutathione (GSH) in Protectionof Cells From Ragusinin (5)We were further interested in the possible role of GSH asa protector of cells in ragusinin-induced cell death. For thatpurpose, HeLa cells were either pre-treated with 5 mM NAC,the precursor for GSH synthesis, for 2 h prior to treatmentwith compound 5 or overnight with a specific inhibitor of GSHsynthesis, i.e., 0.001 mM BSO. The conditions used were testedpreviously to be effective (Brozovic et al., 2008; Brozovic et al.,2014). The obtained data showed that an increased level ofGSH protects HeLa cells from ragusinin\u2019s toxicity (Figure 8A).At the same time, depletion of GSH decreased cell survival ofHeLa cells compared to cells treated with compound 5 only(Figure 8B).Due to the fact that GSH instills several vital roles withina cell including antioxidation, maintenance of the redox state,modulation of the immune response, and detoxification ofxenobiotics (Balendiran et al., 2004), we discussed first its possiblerole as an antioxidant. It is known that the cytotoxicity of thesesquiterpenes helenalin and cynaropicrin can be affected viageneration of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Choet al., 2004; Jang et al., 2013). We examined that possibility forFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97217fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 10Grienke et al.

The cells were treated either with 2.5, 5, and10 \u00b5M of compound 5 for 48 h (A) or with 10 \u00b5M during 24\u201372 h (B). Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry upon cell staining with PI. Therepresentative data of three independent experiments which yielded similar results are shown. The cells were either non-treated or treated with 2.5, 5, and 10 \u00b5M of5. After 48 h and staining with Annexin V and PI, the cell death was measured by flow cytometry.

Results showedthat antioxidants, as well as salubrinal (Brozovic et al., 2013), i.e.,an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum stress, had no impact onragusinin\u2019s toxicity (Supplementary Material, in SupplementaryFigure S6). Thus, we further explored the capability of 5 to reachfunctional protein targets in living cells without being deactivatedby reaction with GSH. The combination treatment of HeLa cellswith the well-known inhibitor of glutathione S-transferase (GST)ethacrynic acid (Osmak et al., 1998) (c = 5 \u00b5g/mL) decreased cellsurvival compared to cells treated with 5 only (Figure 9). The dataimply the enzymatically regulated formation of a detoxificationcomplex between GSH and 5.DISCUSSIONAmong the isolates (1 to 6) from the traditionally used herbalremedy C. ragusina L. leaves, we discovered an interestingpharmacological profile for the rare guajanolides ragusinin (5)and hemistepsin A (6).

Moore (Zdero et al., 1989) and is characterized byan isovalerate residue in position C-9a; compound 6 has beendescribed previously as a constituent from leaves and flowers ofHemisteptia lyrata Bunge (Jang et al., 1999).Whereas both natural compounds showed no antibacterialactivity against the Gram-negative A. baumannii, they exhibitedmoderate inhibitory activity against S. aureus ATTC 25923(MIC value of 31.3 \u00b5g/mL, Supplementary Material). Forcomparison, three STLs (13-acetylsolstitialin A, centaurepensin,and chlorojanerin) isolated from the aerial parts of Centaureasolstitialis L. ssp. solstitialis showed inhibitory activity againststandard S. aureus with MIC values of 16 \u00b5g/mL (\u00d6z\u00e7eliket al., 2009). In line with these findings, we focused on a moreprominent cytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds and theinvestigation of the mechanism of action of the most activecompound 5.We investigated the binding of isolated compounds to DNAsince studying the interactions of compounds with potential drugtargets and the knowledge of their antiproliferative activity canhelp in forming the hypothesis about the mechanism of action ofnovel compounds.The isolated flavonoids (1\u20133) exhibited only weak interactionswith DNA which may explain the absence of cytotoxic effectsagainst the majority of studied cell lines. The somewhat strongercytotoxic activity of flavonoids against HeLa cells can be ascribedto interactions with biological targets other than DNA (Chenet al., 2012). Compound 3 with the highest number of hydroxygroups on the flavonoid skeleton exhibited the most pronouncedcytotoxic activity. This finding is in agreement with literature data(Beutler et al., 1998; Jeong et al., 2007; Csupor-L\u00f6\ufb04er et al., 2009).While there are numerous reports on DNA binding affinitieswith flavonoids (Kanakis et al., 2005; Rusak et al., 2010), thereis little data on DNA binding interactions with sesquiterpenes(Vujc\u02c7ic\u00b4 et al., 2007). Regarding the structure of 5 and literaturedata (Gates, 2009; Chadwick et al., 2013), the interactionwith DNA can be achieved via noncovalent binding todouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or by alkylation of DNAnucleophiles through reaction with the \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3-lactonegroup. Several studies on the reactivity of STLs toward OH-or N-nucleophiles (Atta-ur-Rahman, 2011) and CD changeswhich were not consistent with an alkylation effect (Agarwalet al., 2014) (Supplementary Figure S4) do not support thelatter possibility. In addition, the -SH group was found to bemuch more susceptible to alkylation by sesquiterpenes than othernucleophiles (Gewirtz et al., 2007). A reasonable explanationbased on our results from ITC and CD is noncovalent bindingof 5 most probably inside a hydrophobic interior of the DNAgroove. Due to its rather moderate binding affinity to ctDNA, itcan be concluded that the cellular DNA is not 5\u2019s primary targetin the living cell.Among the isolated STLs, compound 5 showed the strongestcytotoxic activity, especially on murine SCVII as well as humanCaco-2 and HeLa cell lines, while no cytotoxic effect on normalV79 fibroblasts was observed. Similar to the antibacterial activity,a correlation between the cytotoxic activity and the type andproperties of the substituents on the central ring in the vicinity ofthe \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3-lactone group was observed. In comparisonto less lipophilic substituents of sesquiterpenes, as observed forFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97219fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 12Grienke et al. Centaurea ragusina L. Isolates\u2019 BioactivityFIGURE 10 | A summary of the most significant results obtained in this study.6 and especially 4, the hydrophobic character of the isovalerateresidue of 5 most probably enables better penetration throughthe cell membrane and consequently better antibacterial andcytotoxic activity. In the literature, cytotoxic effects of variousSTLs have been explained by selective alkylation of growthregulatory macromolecules such as enzymes which control celldivision and thus a variety of cellular functions (Lyss et al., 1998;Rasul et al., 2012).Since compound 5 (ragusinin) showed the strongest activitycompared to other isolates and since the biological activityof 5 was not described before we decided to investigate themechanism of its toxicity in more details. The IC50 value ofragusinin was between 1.8 and 2.3 \u00b5M (Figure 6). This isconsistent with data from the literature, where compounds ofsimilar chemical structure, i.e., sesquiterpene lactones such ashelenalin (Gertsch et al., 2003), neoambrosin (Saeed et al.,2015), and damsin (Villagomez et al., 2013), are reported tobe cytotoxic against various cell lines in the micromolar range.Further analysis revealed time-dependent accumulation of HeLacells upon ragusinin treatment in the G2 phase and Sub G1phase of the cell cycle (Figure 7B). But, the occurrence ofcaspase and PARP cleavage independent cell death indicatessome alternative cell death pathway described in the literatureto be triggered by a different type of cell stressors (Kroemerand Martin, 2005; Tait and Green, 2008). The phenomenon isinteresting to follow up further, especially because it is knownthat helenalin, a STL isolated from Arnica montana, inducesthe same atypical form of cell death which does not includethe activation of classical mediators of apoptosis (caspases,AIF, Omi/HtrA2, and Apaf/apoptosome) (Hoffmann et al.,2011).In a series of noteworthy reports on the reactivity andkinetics of helenalin and helenanolide type STLs with GSH,it was demonstrated that at physiological pH helenalin reactswith GSH almost exclusively via its cyclopentenone structurewhile the \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3-lactone site is less reactive (Schmidtet al., 1999). Since the guajanolide 5 possesses one reactivesite, i.e., the \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3-lactone group that can reactwith GSH, we decided to investigate the role of GSH indeactivation of 5.From the literature is known that GSH is one of the majorendogenous antioxidants. In the cytoplasm, GSH is used as asubstrate for glutathione peroxidase in the reduction of H2O2and lipid hydroxyperoxides, a reaction that produces glutathionedisulfide, the so-called oxidative form of GSH. Glutathionedisulfide is rapidly reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase. Thisredox cycling of GSH plays a role in the maintenance of cellularredox homeostasis. GSH binds to endogenous and diversexenobiotic electrophilic compounds either catalytically, throughthe action of glutathione S-transferase, or non-catalytically(Townsend and Tew, 2003; Brozovic et al., 2014). The formedGSH conjugates can be exported from cells, resulting in the loss ofcellular GSH. Our data showed that variation of GSH amount inthe cell induced by a specific precursor in GSH synthesis, NAC ora specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis, BSO had an impact on HeLasurvival upon treatment with 5 (Figure 8). Similar results wereobtained in human colon tumor cells upon BSO and helenalintreatment (Jordan et al., 1987). Moreover, we showed that GSHprobably does not play a role as antioxidant (SupplementaryFigure S6) but rather as molecule which form conjugates with 5increasing in that way the survival of HeLa cells upon treatmentwith it (Figure 9).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97220fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 13Grienke et al. Centaurea ragusina L. Isolates\u2019 BioactivityCONCLUSIONIn this study, the most active compound has shown tobe a sesquiterpene lactone, ragusinin (compound 5) whosebiological activity has not been investigated so far. Currently, ourknowledge about the mechanism of action of STLs is still limited.Several of them reached clinical trials due to their ability to triggercell death in tumor but not in normal cells (Zhou and Zhang,2008; Kawasaki et al., 2009; Crespo-Ortiz and Wei, 2012).Here we are showing for the first time the biological activity ofcompound 5, ragusinin. Although ITC and CD results suggestedthat the cellular DNA is not the primary target of ragusinin in theliving cell, these data represent valuable information since, to thebest of found knowledge, STL\u2212DNA interactions have not beencommunicated before.The variation of the amount of GSH in the cell by using aspecific precursor in GSH synthesis (NAC) or a specific inhibitorof GSH synthesis (BSO) showed the importance of GSH in thecell\u2019s response to 5. Moreover, it was shown that formation ofGSH-ragusinin conjugates increased cell survival what impliesthe role in GSH detoxification rather than in stabilization ofthe cell redox system. Ragusinin induced G2 arrest followed bycaspase-independent cell death.Though the actual protein targets remain unclear at thisstage of the investigation, we can confirm that compound 5 isdeactivated by GSH resulting in a diminished cytotoxic effect.A summary of the most significant results obtained in thisstudy by using specified techniques is presented in Figure 10.In future studies, it will be interesting to investigate whetherragusinin-GSH conjugates have a biological activity or whetherthey are ejected from cells through so-called GSH pumps such asMRP1 and MRP2 (Homolya et al., 2003).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSUG and JR isolated and characterized compounds, analyzed thedata, and wrote a part of the manuscript.

The physico-chemical properties of berberine contribute to the high diversityof extraction and detection methods. Considering its particularities this review describesvarious methods mentioned in the literature so far with reference to the most importantfactors influencing berberine extraction. Further, the common separation and detectionmethods like thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, andmass spectrometry are discussed in order to give a complex overview of the existingmethods. Additionally, many clinical and experimental studies suggest that berberinehas several pharmacological properties, such as immunomodulatory, antioxidative,cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, and renoprotective effects. This review summarizesthe main information about botanical occurrence, traditional uses, extraction methods,and pharmacological effects of berberine and berberine-containing plants.Keywords: berberine, botanical occurrence, traditional uses, extraction methods, biological activitiesINTRODUCTIONBerberineBerberine(5,6-dihydro-9,10-dimethoxybenzo[g]-1,3-benzodioxolo[5,6-a]quinolizinium) Figure 1,is a nonbasic and quaternary benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, a relevant molecule in pharmacology andmedicinal chemistry. Indeed, it is known as a very important natural alkaloid for the synthesisof several bioactive derivatives by means of condensation, modification, and substitution offunctional groups in strategic positions for the design of new, selective, and powerful drugs(Chen et al., 2005).24Neag et al. Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and BioactivitiesFIGURE 1 | Berberine structure (according to ChemSpider database).TRADITIONAL USE OFBERBERINE-CONTAINING SPECIESIn the Berberidaceae family, the genus Berberis comprises of\u223c450\u2013500 species, which represent the main natural source ofberberine. Plants of this genus are used against inflammation,infectious diseases, diabetes, constipation, and other pathologies(Singh A. et al., 2010). The oldest evidence of using barberryfruit (Berberis vulgaris) as a blood purifying agent was written onthe clay tablets in the library of Assyrian emperor Asurbanipalduring 650 BC (Karimov, 1993). In Asia, the extensive useof the stem, stem bark, roots, and root bark of plants richin berberine, particularly Berberis species, has more than 3000years of history. Moreover, they have been used as raw materialor as an important ingredient in Ayurvedic and traditionalChinese medicine (Birdsall, 1997; Kirtikar and Basu, 1998; Guptaand Tandon, 2004; Kulkarni and Dhir, 2010). In Ayurveda,Berberis species have been traditionally used for the treatmentof a wide range of infections of the ear, eye, and mouth, forquick healing of wounds, curing hemorrhoids, indigestion anddysentery, or treatment of uterine and vaginal disorders. It hasalso been used to reduce obesity, and as an antidote for thetreatment of scorpion sting or snakebite (Dev, 2006). Berberineextracts and decoctions are traditionally used for their activitiesagainst a variety of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses,fungi, protozoa, helminthes, in Ayurvedic, Chinese, and Middle-Eastern folk medicines (Tang et al., 2009; Gu et al., 2010).In Yunani medicine, Berberis asiatica has multiple uses,such as for the treatment of asthma, eye sores, jaundice,skin pigmentation, and toothache, as well as for favoring theelimination of inflammation and swelling, and for drying ulcers(Kirtikar and Basu, 1998). Decoction of the roots, and stembarks originating from Berberis aristata, B. chitria, and B. lycium(Indian Berberis species), have been used as domestic treatmentof conjunctivitis or other ophthalmic diseases, enlarged liverand spleen, hemorrhages, jaundice, and skin diseases like ulcers(Rajasekaran and Kumar, 2009). On the other hand, the use ofdecoction of Indian barberry mixed with honey has also beenreported for the treatment of jaundice. Additionally, it has beenreported the use of decoction of Indian barberry and Emblicmyrobalan mixed with honey in the cure of urinary disorders aspainful micturition (Kirtikar and Basu, 1998). Numerous studiesdealing with its antimicrobial and antiprotozoal activities againstdifferent types of infectious organisms (Vennerstrom et al., 1990;Stermitz et al., 2000; Bahar et al., 2011) have been assessed so far.Moreover, it has been used to treat diarrhea (Chen et al., 2014)and intestinal parasites since ancient times in China (Singh andMahajan, 2013), and the Eastern hemisphere, while in China it isalso used for treating diabetes (Li et al., 2004).Nowadays, a significant number of dietary supplements basedon plants containing berberine (Kataoka et al., 2008) are usedfor reducing fever, common cold, respiratory infections, andinfluenza (Fabricant and Farnsworth, 2001). Another reporteduse for berberine-containing plants is their application as anastringent agent to lower the tone of the skin. Also, positiveeffects were observed on the mucous membranes of the upperrespiratory tract and gastrointestinal system with effects on theassociated ailments (Chen et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2016).In southern South America leaves and bark of species of thegenus Berberis are used in traditional medicine administeredfor mountain sickness, infections, and fever (San Mart\u00edn, 1983;Houghton and Manby, 1985; Anesini and Perez, 1993).Furthermore, there are other genera which contain berberine.The genus Mahonia comprises of several species that containberberine. Within them, M. aquifolium has been traditionallyused for various skin conditions. Due to its main alkaloid(berberine), is known to be used in Asian medicine for itsantimicrobial activity. Coptidis rhizoma (rhizomes of Coptischinensis), another plant which contains berberine, is a famousherb very frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine for theelimination of toxins, \u201cdamp-heat syndromes\u201d, \u201cpurge fire\u201d, andto \u201cclear heat in the liver\u201d (Tang et al., 2009). Table 1 gathersa synthesis of the main traditional uses of species containingberberine.BOTANICAL SOURCES OF BERBERINEBerberine has been detected, isolated, and quantified fromvarious plant families and genera including Annonaceae(Annickia, Coelocline, Rollinia, and Xylopia), Berberidaceae(Berberis, Caulophyllum, Jeffersonia, Mahonia, Nandina, andSinopodophyllum), Menispermaceae (Tinospora), Papaveraceae(Argemone, Bocconia, Chelidonium, Corydalis, Eschscholzia,Glaucium, Hunnemannia, Macleaya, Papaver, and Sanguinaria),Ranunculaceae (Coptis, Hydrastis, and Xanthorhiza), andRutaceae (Evodia, Phellodendron, and Zanthoxyllum) (Table 2).The genus Berberis is well-known as the most widely distributednatural source of berberine. The bark of B. vulgaris containsmore than 8% of alkaloids, berberine being the major alkaloid(about 5%) (Arayne et al., 2007).Berberine is also widely present in barks, leaves, twigs,rhizomes, roots, and stems of several medicinal plants species,including Argemone mexicana (Etminan et al., 2005), Berberisaristata, B. aquifolium, B. heterophylla, B. beaniana, Cosciniumfenestratum (Rojsanga and Gritsanapan, 2005), C. chinensis,C. japonica, C. rhizome, Hydratis canadensis (Imanshahidi andFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55725Neag et al.

In the Papaveraceae family, Chelidoniummajus is another important herbal source of berberine (Tom\u00e8and Colombo, 1995). An important number of plants formedicinal use, such as Coptidis rhizoma and barberry, are thenatural sources with the highest concentration of berberine.Barberries, such as Berberis aristata, B. aquifolium, B. asiatica,B. croatica, B. thunbergii, and B. vulgaris, are shrubs grownmainly in Asia and Europe, and their barks, fruits, leaves, androots are often widely used as folk medicines (Imanshahidiand Hosseinzadeh, 2008; Kosalec et al., 2009; Andola et al.,2010c; Kulkarni and Dhir, 2010). Different research groups havereported that maximum berberine concentration accumulatesin root (1.6\u20134.3%) and in most of the Berberis species, plantsthat grow at low altitude contain more berberine compared tohigher altitude plants (Chandra and Purohit, 1980; Mikage andMouri, 1999; Andola et al., 2010a). However, a correlation couldnot be established within the results of berberine concentrationregarding to species and season of the year (Srivastava et al.,2006a,c; Andola et al., 2010c; Singh et al., 2012). Comparativestudies of berberine concentration contained in different speciesof the same genus have been reported, e.g., higher berberinecontent in B. asiatica (4.3%) in comparison to B. lycium (4.0%),and B. aristata (3.8%). Meanwhile, Srivastava et al. (2004)documented a higher berberine content in root of B. aristata(2.8%) compared with B. asiatica (2.4%) (Andola et al., 2010a).Seasonal variation of berberine concentration has been reported,e.g., the maximum yield of berberine for B. pseudumbellata wasobtained in the summer harvest, and was 2.8% in the roots and1.8% for the stem bark, contrary to that reported in the roots ofB. aristata, where the berberine concentration (1.9%) is higherfor the winter harvest (Rashmi et al., 2009). These variations maybe caused to multiple factors, among which stand out: (i) theintraspecific differences, (ii) location and/or, (iii) the analyticaltechniques used. Table 2 gathers a synthesis of the main speciescontaining berberine.EXTRACTION METHODSBerberine, a quaternary protoberberine alkaloid (QPA) is one ofthe most widely distributed alkaloid of its class. Current studiessuggest that isolation of the QPA alkaloids from their matrixcan be performed using several methods. The principles behindthese methods consist of the interconversion reaction betweenthe protoberberine salt and the base. The salts are soluble inwater, stable in acidic, and neutral media, while the base is solublein organic solvents. Thus during the extraction procedure, theprotoberberine salts are converted in their specific bases andfurther extracted in the organic solvents (Marek et al., 2003;Grycov\u00e1 et al., 2007).In the case of berberine, the classical extraction techniqueslike maceration, percolation, Soxhlet, cold or hot continuousextraction are using different solvent systems like methanol,ethanol, chloroform, aqueous, and/or acidified mixtures.Berberine\u2019s sensitivity to light and heat is the major challengefor its extraction. Hence, exposure to high temperature and lightcould lead to berberine degradation and thus influencing itsmatrix recovery. In his study Babu et al. (2012) demonstratedthat temperature represent a crucial factor in both extractionand drying treatments prior extraction. The yield of berberinecontent in C. fenestratum stem tissue samples was higher incase of samples dried under the constant shade with 4.6%weight/weight (w/w) as compared to samples dried in ovenat 65\u25e6C (1.32% w/w) or sun drying (3.21% w/w).

As seen in Table 3, methanol, ethanol, aqueous oracidified methanol or ethanol are the most used extractionsolvents. The acidified solvents (usually with the addition of 0.5%of inorganic or organic acids) are used to combine with freebase organic alkaloids and transform them in alkaloid salts withhigher solubility (Teng and Choi, 2013). The effect of differentinorganic acids like hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, nitricacid, and sulfuric acid as well as the effect of an organic acidlike acetic acid were tested on berberine content and otheralkaloids in rhizomes of Coptis chinensis Franch by Teng andChoi (2013). In this case, 0.34% phosphoric acid concentrationwas considered optimal. Moreover, when compared to otherclassical extraction techniques like reflux and Soxhlet extraction,the cold acid assisted extraction gave 1.1 times higher berberineyields.Large solvent volumes and long extraction time representother drawbacks of conventional extraction methods (Mokgadiet al., 2013). For example, Rojsanga and Gritsanapan (2005)used maceration process to extract 100 g of C. fenestratumplant material with a total volume of 3,200mL solvent (80%ethanol) over a period of 416 h. Furthermore, in a differentstudy, Rojsanga et al. (2006) used several classical extractiontechniques likemaceration, percolation, and Soxhlet extraction toextract the berberine from C. fenestratum stems. This time evenif the extracted plant material was in a lower amount than theprevious study (30 vs. 100 g), large solvent volumes (2,000mLfor maceration, 5,000mL for percolation, and 600mL for Soxhletextraction) over long time periods (7 days for macerationand 72 h for Soxhlet extraction) were employed (Rojsanga andGritsanapan, 2005; Rojsanga et al., 2006).Large solvent volumes are characteristic for otherconventional methods too. Shigwan et al. (2013) extractedberberine from Berberis aristata and B. tinctoria powdered stembark (800 g) using hot extraction (50\u25e6C for 3 h) with 2,500mLmethanol (Shigwan et al., 2013).Even though conventional methods are widely used inberberine extraction, a number of other different methods havebeen developed lately. This led to an improved extractionefficiency, a decreased extraction time and solvents\u2019 volumes usedin the extraction. Thus, ultrasound assisted solvent extraction(USE), microwave-assisted solvent extraction (MAE), ultrahighpressure extraction (UPE), and supercritical fluid extractions(SFE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) have been successfullyused as alternative extraction techniques with better results whencompared with classical extraction methods.Ultrasonically and microwave-assisted extraction areconsidered green, simple, efficient, and inexpensive techniques(Alupului et al., 2009).Teng and Choi (2013) extracted berberine from Rhizomecoptidis by optimized USE. Using response surface methodology,they identified that the optimal extraction conditions were 59%ethanol concentration, at 66.22\u25e6C within 46.57min. A decreasein the extraction time (39.81min) was obtained by Chang (2013).He used the combination of ionic liquids solutions as greensolvents with USE to extract berberine from Coptis chinensis inorder to apply an environmentally friendly approach (Chang,2013). Moreover, in their study, Xu et al. (2017) comparedseveral extraction tehniques like USE, distillation, and Soxhletextraction in order to establish an high-efficient methodfor phellodendrine, berberine, and palmatine extraction fromfresh Phellodendron bark (Cortex phellodendri). In the case ofberberine, the combination of simple or acidified solvent (water,ethanol, andmethanol) with the adjustment of the specific settingcharacteristics to each extraction type enabled them to determinethe highest extraction yield. They concluded that the use ofUSE and hydrochloric acid-acidified methanol were the mostefficient in extracting berberine. The USE extraction yield wassignificantly higher when compared to distillation and Soxhletextraction, with values of \u223c100 mg/g toward 50 and 40 mg/gberberine, respectively (Xu et al., 2017).The important reduction in organic solvent and extractiontime determined the increasing interest in MAE, too. Lately,MAE was used as a green and cost-effective alternative toconventional methods. Using central composite design, Satijaet al. (2015) successfully optimized the MAE parameters in termsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55735Neag et al. Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and BioactivitiesFIGURE 2 | Short view on berberine extraction methods.of irradiation power, time, and solvent concentration to extractberberine form Tinospora cardifolia. They compared two classicalextraction techniques like maceration and Soxhlet extractionwith MAE under optimized conditions (60% irradiation power,80% ethanol concentration, and 3min extraction time). Theresults showed that MAE extraction had the highest yieldof berberine content with 1.66% (w/w) while Soxhlet andmaceration had 1.04 and 0.28% (w/w), respectively. Their study isemphasizing the dramatic time reduction in case of MAE (3min)when compared with Soxhlet extraction (3 h) and maceration (7days) together with solvent and energy consumption (Satija et al.,2015).Another novel extraction technique considered to beenvironmentally friendly is UPE. The interest toward thisextraction technique is increasing because it presents severaladvantages toward classical extraction techniques like increasedextraction yields, higher quality of extracts, less extractiontime, and decreased solvent consumption (Xi, 2015). These areachieved at room temperature by applying different pressurelevels (from 100 to 600MPa) between the interior (higher values)and the exterior of cells (lower values) in order to facilitate thetransfer of the bioactive compounds through the plant matricesin the extraction solvent (Liu et al., 2006, 2013). In the studyregarding berberine content in Cortex phellodendri, Guopinget al. (2012) made a comparison between UPE, MAE, USE, andheat reflux extraction techniques. They observed that the higherextraction yield and the lower extraction time was obtained incase of UPE with 7.7 mg/g and 2min extraction time towardreflux, USE and MAE with 5.35 mg/g and 2 h, 5.61 mg/g and 1 h.and 6 mg/g and 15min, respectively (Guoping et al., 2012).Super critical fluid extraction is another environmentallyfriendly efficient technique used in phytochemical extraction.Because the extraction is performed in the absence of light andoxygen, the degradation of bioactive compounds is reduced. Also,the inert and non-toxic carbon dioxide used as a main extractionsolvent in combination with various modifiers (e.g., methanol)and surfactants (e.g., Tween 80) at lower temperatures andrelatively low pressure, allows the efficient extraction of bioactivecompounds (Liu et al., 2006; Far\u00edas-Campomanes et al., 2015). Incase of berberine extraction from the powdered rhizome ofCoptischinensis Franch, the highest recovery of berberine was obtainedwhen 1,2-propanediol was used as amodifier of supercritical CO2(Liu et al., 2006).Pressurized liquid extraction, also known as pressurizedfluid extraction, pressurized solvent extraction, and acceleratedsolvent extraction (ASE) is considered a green technology usedfor compounds extraction from plants (Mustafa and Turner,2011). Compared with conventional methods, PLE increasesthe extraction yield, decreases time and solvent consumption,and protects sensitive compounds. In their study, Schieffer andPfeiffer (2001) compared different extraction techniques likePLE, multiple USE, single USE, and Soxhlet extraction in orderto extract berberine from goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis).When compared in terms of extraction yield the results arecomparable,\u223c42 mg/g berberine, except single USE with slightlylower content (37 mg/g berberine). Big differences were observedin the extraction time, PLE requiring only 30min for a singlesample extraction compared to 2 h for multiple extractiontechniques or 6 h for Soxhlet extraction (Schieffer and Pfeiffer,2001).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55736Neag et al.

Other extractiontechniques like solid phase extraction (SPE) can also beapplied.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55740Neag et al. Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and BioactivitiesANALYTICAL TECHNIQUESAfter extraction and purification, the separation andquantification of berberine are commonly resolved bychromatographic methods. According to literature studies,berberine determination in plants was predominantly performedusing methods like UV spectrophotometry (Joshi and Kanaki,2013), HPLC (Babu et al., 2012; Akowuah et al., 2014), HPTLCand TLC (Rojsanga and Gritsanapan, 2005; Arawwawala andWickramaar, 2012; Samal, 2013), capillary electrophoresis (Duand Wang, 2010), while berberine content in biological fluidswas mainly achieved by using LC-MS (Deng et al., 2008; Fenget al., 2010), UPLC-MS (Liu M. et al., 2015; Liu L. et al., 2016),UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS (Wu et al., 2015).UV-Vis spectrophotometry can be considered as one of themost rapid detection methods for berberine quantitative analysisfrom plant extracts. Based on the Beer-Lambert law, berberineconcentration can be determined according to its absorptionmaxima at 348 nm. Joshi and Kanaki (2013) quantified berberinein Rasayana churna samples in the range of 2\u201320 \u00b5g/mL, theinterference with other compounds being avoided by the specificisolation of the alkaloid fraction (Joshi and Kanaki, 2013).Next, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is aversatile, robust, and widely used technique for the qualitativeand quantitative analysis of natural products (Sasidharan et al.,2011). This approach is widely used in berberine identificationand quantification. Generally, the choices of stationary phasein berberine separation are variants of C18-based silica column(Table 3) with a mobile phase consisting of simple or acidifiedsolvents like water, methanol, or acetonitrile, used as suchor in combination with phosphate buffers. Normally, theidentification and separation of berberine can be accomplishedusing either isocratic or gradient elution system. Berberineidentification is further accomplished using high sensitivity UVor DAD (diode array detectors) detectors. For example, Shigwanet al. (2013) developed in his study a reverse phase HPLCmethod with photodiode array detection (PDA) to quantifyberberine from Berberis aristata and B. tinctoria. They useda Unisphere-C18 column (5\u00b5m, 4.6 \u00d7 150mm) with anisocratic gradient of acidified water (with 0.1% trifluoroaceticacid) and acetonitrile (60:40, v/v) to elute berberine within5min. The developed method was reproducible, validated,precise, and specific for berberine quantification (with aconcentration range between 0.2 and 150\u00b5g/mL; Shigwan et al.,2013).Two other commonly used techniques in berberinequantification are thin layer chromatography (TLC) andhigh performance thin layer chromatography (HTPLC).Sometimes, these methods are preferred over HPLC, offeringthe possibility of running several samples simultaneously alongwith the use of small amount of both samples and mobile phases(Samal, 2013). For these reasons, Samal (2013) used an HPTLCmethod to quantify berberine from A. mexicana L. using tolueneand ethyl acetate (9:3, v/v) as mobile phases, and a silica gelplate as stationary phase, they developed a simple, rapid, andcost-effective method for berberine quantification. The LOD(0.120 \u00b5g) and LOQ (0.362 \u00b5g) of the method are in accordancewith high-quality requirements.Following the same principles (small sample volume,high separation efficiency, and short analysis time), capillaryelectrophoresis (CE) was successfully used in berberineanalysis. Du and Wang (2010) used CE with end-columnelectrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection for berberineanalysis in both tablets and Rhizoma coptidis. Using a 4minanalysis time, a small sample volume (3.3 nL) and a LOD of (5\u00d710\u22129 g/mL), the developed method proved to be highly sensitiveand with good resolution (Du and Wang, 2010).Besides UV, HPLC, HTPLC, TLC, and CE, other detectionmethods like liquid chromatography coupled with massspectrometry (LC/MS) are currently employed to quantifyberberine in biological fluids. Generally, it is considered apowerful technique for the analysis of complex samples becauseit offers rapid and accurate information about the structuralcomposition of the compounds, especially when tandem massspectrometry (MSn) is applied. For example, Xu et al. (2015)developed a sensitive an accurate LC-MS/MS method todetermine berberine and other seven components in rat plasmausing multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode. Compoundsseparation was optimized using six different types of reverse-phase columns, and two different mobile phases (methanol\u2013water and acetonitrile\u2013water with different additives). Additiveslike formic acid, acetic acid, and ammonium acetate were addedin different concentrations as follows: 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2% forformic acid, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2% for acetic acid and 0.0001, 0.001,0.01 mol/L for ammonium acetate. The method was also testedin terms of specificity, linearity, lower limit of quantification(LLOQ), precision, accuracy, and stability (Xu et al., 2015).ANTIOXIDANT EFFECTUnder normal conditions, the body maintains a balancebetween the antioxidant and pro-oxidant agents (reactive oxygenspecies\u2014ROS and reactive nitrogen species\u2014RNS; Rahal et al.,2014).The imbalance between pro and antioxidants occurs in case ofincreased oxidative stress (Bhattacharyya et al., 2014).The oxidative stress builds up through several mechanisms: anincrease in the production of reactive species, a decrease in thelevels of enzymes involved in blocking the actions of pro-oxidantcompounds, and/or the decrease in free radical scavengers (Pilchet al., 2014).An experimental study demonstrated the effect of berberineon lipid peroxidation after inducing chemical carcinogenesis insmall animals (rats). An increase in LPO (lipid peroxidation) wasobserved after carcinogenesis induction, but also its significantreversal after berberine administration (30 mg/kg). Berberineshows therefore at least partial antioxidant properties, due to itseffect on lipid peroxidation (Thirupurasundari et al., 2009).Other mechanisms involved in the antioxidant role ofberberine are: ROS/RNS scavenging, binding of metals leadingto the transformation/oxidation of certain substances, free-oxygen removal, reducing the destructiveness of superoxide ionsand nitric oxide, or increasing the antioxidant effect of someendogenous substances. The antioxidant effect of berberine wascomparable with that of vitamin C, a highly-potent antioxidant(Shirwaikar et al., 2006; Ahmed et al., 2015).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55741Neag et al. Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and BioactivitiesThe increase in blood sugar leads to oxidative stress notby generating oxygen reactive species but by impairing theantioxidant mechanisms. Administration of berberine to ratswith diabetes mellitus increased the SOD (superoxide dismutase)activity and decreased theMDA (malondialdehyde) level (markerof lipid peroxidation). This antioxidant effect of berberine couldexplain the renal function improvement in diabetic nephropathy(Liu et al., 2008b).The oxidative stress plays an important role in thepathogenesis of many diseases. The beneficial effect of berberineis presumed to reside mostly in its antioxidant role.CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OFBERBERINEEffect on Cardiac ContractilityThe beneficial effect of berberine in cardiac failure wasdemonstrated in a study on 51 patients diagnosed with NYHA(New York Heart Association) III/IV cardiac failure with low leftventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and premature ventricularcontractions and/or ventricular tachycardia. These patientsreceived tablets containing 1.2 g berberine/day, together withconventional therapy (diuretics, ACEI\u2014angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, nitrates) for 2 weeks. An increasein LVEF was observed in all patients after this period, butalso a decrease in the frequency and complexity of prematureventricular contractions. The magnitude of the beneficial effectwas in direct proportion with the plasma concentration ofberberine (Zeng, 1999).The Cardioprotective Effect DuringIschemiaBerberine can provide cardio-protection in ischemic conditionsby playing various roles at different levels: modulation ofAMPK (AMP\u2014activated kinase) activity, AKT (proteinkinase B) phosphorylation, modulation of the JAK/STAT(Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription)pathway and of GSK3\u03b2 (glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2; Changet al., 2016). AMPK is an important enzyme playing an essentialrole in cellular metabolism and offering protection in ischemicconditions by adjusting the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism,the function of cell organelles (mitochondria, endoplasmicreticulum) and the apoptosis (Zaha et al., 2016).Berberine activates the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT pathway which is considered a compensatorymechanism limiting the pro-inflammatory processes andapoptotic events in the presence of aggressive factors. Theactivation of this pathway is associated with a reduction of theischemic injury through the modulation of the TLR4 (toll-likereceptor 4)-mediated signal transduction (Hua et al., 2007).Several supporting data indicate that the JAK2/STAT3signaling plays an important role in cardioprotection againstischemia-reperfusion injury (Mascareno et al., 2001).GSK3\u03b2 is a serine/threonine protein-kinase, an enzymeinvolved in reactions associated to important processes at thecellular level: metabolization, differentiation, proliferation, andapoptosis. Berberine inhibits this kinase, thereby exercising itscardioprotective effect (Park et al., 2014).EFFECTS ON THE ENDOTHELIUMBerberine induces endothelial relaxation by increasing NOproduction from arginine through the activity of eNOS(endothelial nitric oxide synthase) which is considered a keyelement in the vasodilation process. Besides increasing the NOlevel, it also up-regulates eNOS mRNA. Furthermore, berberinefacilitates the phosphorylation of eNOS and its coupling toHSP 90 (heat shock proteins), which consequently increases NOproduction (Wang et al., 2009).Moreover, berberine reduces endothelial contractionby reducing COX-2 expression. Any imbalance inCOX 1 or 2 activity may alter the ratio betweenprothrombotic/antithrombotic and vasodilator/vasoconstrictoreffects (Liu L. et al., 2015).The beneficial effect of berberine on the TNF\u03b1-inducedendothelial contraction was also recorded, as well as an increasein the level of PI3K/AKT/eNOS mRNA (Xiao et al., 2014).THE ROLE OF BERBERINE INATHEROSCLEROSISAtherogenesis is a consequence of high blood lipid levels andis associated with inflammatory changes in the vascular wall.Berberine interferes with this process by up-regulating theexpression of SIRT1 (silent information regulator T1) and byinhibiting the expression of PPAR\u03b3 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3). SIRT1 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase.The SIRT1 enzyme has many targets (PPAR\u03b3 , p53), all playingdifferent roles in atherogenesis (Chi et al., 2014).The Role of Berberine in Lipid MetabolismThe effects of berberine on lipid metabolism are also theconsequence of its effects on LDL cholesterol receptors. On onehand, these receptors are stabilized by an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway, and on the other,berberine increases the activity of LDL receptors through the JNKpathway (Cicero and Ertek, 2009).Moreover, berberine has an effect on ACAT (cholesterolacyltransferases), a class of enzymes that transform cholesterolinto esters, thus playing an essential role in maintainingcholesterol homeostasis in different tissues. There are two typesof ACAT enzymes, ACAT1, and ACAT2. ACAT1 is a ubiquitousenzyme, while ACAT2 can be found only in hepatic cells andenterocytes. Berberine influences the activity of ACAT2 withoutan effect on ACAT1, therefore reducing the intestinal absorptionof cholesterol and decreasing its plasmatic level (Chang et al.,2009; Wang et al., 2014).The hypolipidemic effect of berberine is also a result of itsaction on PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9). Thisenzyme can attach itself to LDL receptors, leading to a decrease inLDL metabolization and an increase in its blood level (Xiao et al.,2012).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55742Neag et al. Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and BioactivitiesIn a clinical trial, 63 patients with dyslipidemia were randomlydivided in three groups. The first group was treated withberberine (1,000 mg/day), the second with simvastatin (20mg/day) and the third with a combination of berberine andsimvastatin. The authors reported a 23.8% reduction in LDL-Clevels in patients treated with berberine, a 14.3% reduction inthose treated with simvastatin and a 31.8% LDL-C reduction inthe group treated with both simvastatin and berberine. This resultdemonstrates that berberine can be used alone or in associationwith simvastatin in the treatment of dyslipidemia (Kong et al.,2008).THE ROLE OF BERBERINE IN GLUCOSEMETABOLISMMany studies demonstrated that berberine lowers blood sugar,through the following mechanisms:- Inhibition of mitochondrial glucose oxidation andstimulation of glycolysis, and subsequently increasedglucose metabolization (Yin et al., 2008a).- Decreased ATP level through the inhibition of mitochondrialfunction in the liver, which may be the probable explanationof gluconeogenesis inhibition by berberine (Xia et al., 2011).- Inhibition of DPP 4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), a ubiquitousserine protease responsible for cleaving certain peptides, suchas the incretins GLP1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP(gastric inhibitory polypeptide); their role is to raise theinsulin level in the context of hyperglycemia. The DPP4inhibition will prolong the duration of action for thesepeptides, therefore improving overall glucose tolerance (Al-masri et al., 2009; Seino et al., 2010).Berberine has a beneficial effect in improving insulin resistanceand glucose utilization in tissues by lowering the lipid(especially triglyceride) and plasma free fatty acids levels(Chen et al., 2011).The effect of berberine (1,500mg day) on glucose metabolismwas also demonstrated in a pilot study enrolling 84 patients withtype 2 diabetes mellitus. The effect, including on HbA1c, wascomparable to that of metformin (1,500 mg/day), one of the mostwidely used hypoglycemic drugs. In addition, berberine has afavorable influence on the lipid profile, unlike metformin, whichhas barely any effect (Yin et al., 2008b).HEPATOPROTECTIVE EFFECT OFBERBERINEThe hepatoprotective effect of berberine was demonstratedon lab animals (mice), in which hepatotoxicity was inducedby doxorubicin. Pretreatment with berberine significantlyreduced both functional hepatic tests and histological damage(inflammatory cellular infiltrate, hepatocyte necrosis; Zhao et al.,2012).The mechanism by which berberine reduces hepatotoxicitywas also studied on CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride)-inducedhepatotoxicity. Berberine lowers the oxidative and nitrosaminestress and also modulates the inflammatory response in theliver, with favorable effects on the changes occurring in theliver. Berberine prevents the decrease in SOD activity andthe increase in lipid peroxidation and contributes to thereduction in TNF-\u03b1, COX-2, and iNOS (inducible nitric oxidesynthase) levels. The decrease in transaminase levels supportsthe hypothesis according to which berberine helps maintain theintegrity of the hepatocellular membrane (Domitrovic\u00b4 et al.,2011).NEPHROPROTECTIVE EFFECT OFBERBERINEThe chronic kidney damage occurring in time in patients withHT (hypertension) and DM (diabetes mellitus) is well known; itis mainly due to the atherosclerosis of the renal artery, causedby inflammation and oxidative stress. The protective effect ofberberine on kidneys was studied on 69 patients suffering fromboth HT and DM, with blood pressure and blood sugar levelscontrolled with conventional medication. The patients received300mg berberine/day for 24 months, with 2-week interruptionsevery 5 months. The authors recorded lower CRP (C-reactiveprotein), MDA and SOD levels after treatment, but withoutsignificant changes in creatinine, arterial pressure, or glycaemialevels. These results support the renal protective effect ofberberine through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects(Dai et al., 2015).Another animal study tested the renoprotective effect ofberberine after administration of HgCl2 (mercury chloride).This substance induces hepato-renal damage by increasing theoxidative stress (increases lipid peroxidation and NO levels, andlowers glutathione and SOD levels as well as the activity of otherprotective enzymes). Administration of HgCl2 increased the AST(aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase),and ALP (alkaline phosphatase) levels, compared to the controlgroup. However, pretreatment with berberine lowered theseenzymes significantly. In addition, both urea and creatinine levelswere significantly increased in the HgCl2 group vs. the controlgroup, and again pretreatment with berberine prevented thesechanges. Additionally, the authors recorded higher pro-oxidantand lower antioxidant levels in the intervention group. Thesedata support the hepatic and renal protective effects of berberine.Other studies performed on animal models with CCl4\u2212inducedhepatotoxicity demonstrated the same effect (Othman et al.,2014).In addition, berberine can lower the nephrotoxicity causedby cisplatine. In an animal study, berberine was administeredin progressive doses of 1, 2, 3mg/kg, orally, for 2 successivedays, starting 2 days after cisplatine administration. After thelast doses of berberine, the animals were sacrificed and thekidneys were examined by the pathologist. The results showedsignificant histological improvement and a reduction in NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated Bcells), TNF \u03b1, COX2 an iNOS levels, all of which supportthe anti-inflammatory effect of berberine (Domitrovic\u00b4 et al.,2013).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55743Neag et al.

The beneficial effectof berberine on this animal model resided in its influenceon cellular and humoral immunity through the inhibition oflymphocyte proliferation (especially CD4), and the decrease inpro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF \u03b1; Li et al., 2014).Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is anestablished model of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis isa one of the most common diseases of the central nervoussystem (CNS) and involves neurodegenerative and inflammatoryprocesses, and autoimmune demyelination (Ransohoff et al.,2015). The blood-brain barrier permeability and changes inmatrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels in the cerebrospinal fluidand brain were studied using this model (Ma et al., 2010). MMPsmay be involved in demyelination and their activity in tissuesdepends on the balance between their level and their tissueinhibitors. MMP2 and MMP9 are the main endoproteinasesinvolved in the migration of lymphocytes in CNS and in alteringthe BBB (blood brain barrier) (Avolio et al., 2003). Berberine has abeneficial effect in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitisby inhibiting the activity of MMP9, reducing BBB permeabilityand, consecutively, by decreasing the inflammatory cellularinfiltration of the CNS (Ma et al., 2010).The current therapy used for inflammatory bowel diseases,including glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents, hasa low level of safety. The effect of berberine was studiedin combination with 5-ASA (5-aminosalicylic acid) vs. 5-ASAalone using an experimental animal model with DSS (dextransulfate sodium)-induced colitis. The authors analyzed the levelFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55744Neag et al. Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and Bioactivitiesof proinflammatory cytokines in the animal gut. A decrease inCOX2, IL6, and IL23 mRNA levels was observed in animalstreated only with 5-ASA, whereas animals treated with both 5-ASA and berberine had a reduction in mRNA levels for COX2,IL6, IL23 as well as for TNF alfa and IL12b. This beneficial effectcould partially be attributed to the inhibition of NF-kB and thereduction in JAK2 phosphorylation (through the influence on theJAK/STAT pathway) by both 5-ASA and berberine (Li et al., 2015;Figure 3).Another study demonstrated that berberine increases thecorticosteroid level in rats with experimentally-induced colitis.This engendered the theory that its beneficial effect may also beattributed to the increase in endogenous glucocorticoid levels,compounds with well-known therapeutic effect in inflammatorybowel disease (Minaiyan et al., 2011).CONCLUSIONA review of the available scientific literature shows thatthe traditional medical uses of berberine-containing plantshave been evaluated by modern pharmacological studies.Different species of berberine-rich plants have multiplepharmacological and therapeutic actions, such as antioxidantand immunomodulatory effects, protective action on thecardiovascular system, liver and kidney, endothelial relaxation,regulator on glucose metabolism and atherosclerosis, whichcan all be explained by the presence of berberine as wellas other phyto constituents (when dealing with berberine-containing plant extracts). Moreover, the effects of berberinevary according to its origin (different plants or pharmaceuticalproducts) and its concentration, depending on the very diverseextraction and detection techniques already described. Overtime, modern extraction techniques were increasingly preferredto classical ones. Since classical methods are generally time- andsolvent-consuming processes, modern extraction techniquessuch as USE, MAE, UPE, SFE, and PLE are seen as betteralternatives to overcome these limitations. Furthermore,berberine, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatoryeffects, has several clinical applications in many disorders,from inflammatory conditions to the metabolic syndrome.However, there are some traditional uses that have not yetbeen completely elucidated, and further studies are needed.Therefore, extensive studies on the potential of plants containingberberine that have shown aforementioned pharmacologicalactivities should go through additional in vitro and in vivostudies.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSMN, AM, JE, and RP have conceived and designed the structureof the manuscript, data collection, and drafting, as well as itsrevision.

For instance, the European Medicines Agency has approved 68anti-cancer drugs, and out of which 39 has reached the market level with no indicationof increased survival nor betterment of quality of life. Even when drugs did improvesurvival rate compared to available treatment strategies, most of these were found to beclinically insignificant. This is a fundamental problem with modern drug discovery whichis based on thinking that most chronic diseases are caused by alteration of a singlegene and thus most therapies are single gene-targeted therapies. However, extensiveresearch has revealed that most chronic diseases are caused by multiple gene products.Although most drugs designed by man are mono-targeted therapies, however, thosedesigned by \u201cmother nature\u201d and have been used for thousands of years, are \u201cmulti-targeted\u201d therapies. In this review, we examine two agents that have been around forthousands of years, namely \u201cguggul\u201d from Commiphora and Boswellia. Although we areall familiar with the search engine \u201cgoogle,\u201d this is another type of \u201cguggul\u201d that has beenused for centuries and being explored for its various biological activities. The currentreview summarizes the traditional uses, chemistry, in vitro and in vivo biological activities,molecular targets, and clinical trials performed with these agents.Keywords: guggul, guggulsterone, boswellia, boswellic acid, cancer, commiphora, chronic diseasesINTRODUCTIONDespite the remarkable advances made in the field of therapies for chronic diseases includingcancer over the last few decades, they still present a major health burden and are the prime causeof death across the world. Most of the chronic illnesses are caused by the deregulation of multiplegenes; however majority of the drugs approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) targetsingle gene product or pathway only. This displays one of the major drawbacks of these syntheticdrugs. In addition, these drugs are associated with different adverse side effects and hence nottolerable by patients (Siddiqui et al., 1984; Sarup et al., 2015; Kunnumakkara et al., 2017; Baniket al., 2018). Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel, safe, and multi-targeted agents forthe prevention and treatment of these diseases (Bordoloi et al., 2016; Kunnumakkara et al., 2018).54Kunnumakkara et al. Googling the GuggulIt has been well-evidenced that natural products are effective,multi-targeted, and extremely safe as they are the roots of manytraditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha,traditional Chinese medicine etc. (Shishodia et al., 2008; Harshaet al., 2017). One such medicine of enormous use in Ayurveda is\u201cGuggul.\u201d Guggul is the gum resin obtained from two differentplants Commiphora and Boswellia, produced by drying the whitesap of 15\u201320 years old tree for a year (Figure 1; Hanus et al.,2005).The history of guggul goes as far back as 1700 BC. Ancientscript on medicine and surgery; Sushrut Samhita, describes thatguggul when taken orally can cure internal tumors, malignantsores, obesity, liver dysfunction, intestinal worms, leucoderma,sinus, and edema. It is also used as an Ayurvedic medicinefor the prevention and treatment of various other diseasessuch as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcers, arthritis,cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes etc. (Shishodia et al.,2008). The main ingredients of guggul are guggulsterone (GS)and boswellic acid (BA) which are obtained from Commiphoraand Boswellia respectively. It also contains a huge number oflignans and ketosterols, which contributes to the vivid healthbeneficiary effects of guggul (Arora et al., 1971, 1972; Kimuraet al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2001; Francis et al., 2004).According to Pubmed; \u201cgoogle,\u201d there are 449 publicationson Commiphora, 519 on Boswellia, 207 on guggulsterone, 329on boswellic acid, and 90 on guggul with earliest being in 1960describing the \u201cAntiarthritic and anti-inflammatory activity ofthe gum \u201cguggul\u201d; and in 1969 on \u201cAnalgesic effect of the gumresin from Boswellia serata.\u201d Some of the major species includeCommiphora wightii (guggul), Commiphora mukul, Commiphoragileadensis, Boswellia serrata (salai guggul), Boswellia carterii,Boswellia sacra (source of frankincense & gum resin), Boswelliaovalifoliolata, Boswellia dalzielii, Boswellia frerean, and BoswelliaFIGURE 1 | (A) Commiphora (Mark W. Skinner/www.discoverlife.org) andGum guggul (http://www.varionlife.com). (B) Boswellia (PankajOudhia/www.discoverlife.org) and Salai guggul.thurifera. What is common among all these plants and theirproducts is that all of them exhibit anti-inflammatory activities,although to a variable extent. The current review describes thetraditional uses, chemistry, molecular targets, in vitro, in vivoand clinical studies of guggul isolated from Commiphora andBoswellia.SOURCE AND CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTSOF COMMIPHORA AND BOSWELLIAThe guggul tree which belongs to the family Burseraceae, ismainly found in the dry regions of the Indian subcontinentmainly India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The oleogum resinof C. mukul (guggul tree) is a yellowish substance that istapped during winter and \u223c700\u2013900 g of resin is obtainedfrom each tree (Deng, 2007; Shishodia et al., 2015; Yamadaand Sugimoto, 2016). The guggul or balsam or the oleo gumresin is found in the balsam canals in the phloem of thelarge veins of leaf and base of the stem. It is a complicatedmixture of minerals, gum, terpenes, sterols (Guggulsterol -I,-II,-III,-IV,-V), essential oils, sterones (Z-, E-, M-guggulsterone, anddehydroguggulsterone-M), ferrulates, lignans, and flavanones.The ethyl acetate soluble fraction also known as guggulipid,consists of various bioactive components like diterpenoids,triterpenoids, steroids, lignans, and fatty tetrol esters. Basedon the pH gradient, further fractionation yields 95% neutral,4% acidic, and 1% basic fractions. The neutral fraction whensubjected to further fractionation produces 88% non-ketonic and12% ketonic fractions. A large number of steroids including thetwo isomers E-(cis-) and Z-(trans-) GS [4, 17(20)-pregnadiene-3, 16-dione] were obtained from the ketonic fraction. Nearly 5%guggulipid and 2% gum guggul by weight is present in the GS(Figure 2A; Deng, 2007; Shishodia et al., 2008, 2015; Sarup et al.,2015).Phenolics are common natural products found in plants andpossess substantial antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.Various phenolic compounds such as hydroxybenzoic acidderivatives such as gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, gentisicacid, vanillic acid, p-hydroxy benzoic acid, syringic acid, ellagicacid, and cinnamic acid derivatives which include caffeic acid,chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid (SA), and p-coumaricacid are largely present in plants. These phenolic compoundsare predominantly available in guggul as well, which in partcontributes to its immense biological function against diversehuman chronic diseases (Hazra et al., 2018).Guggulsterone is the only known antagonist of farnesoidX receptor (FXR). This FXR, also known as NR1H4 (nuclearreceptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4), is a bile acid receptor(BAR). Bioinformatics studies (molecular docking simulation)revealed that GS binds to FXR and nuclear factor-kappa B(NF-\u03baB) and it docks into two non-canonical binding sitesof FXR, helix 1-loop-helix 2 loop and parts of helix\u2014helix 8including helix 8-loop-helix 9 (Meyer et al., 2005; Yang et al.,2014). Different bile acids and chenodeoxycholic acids act asnatural ligand for FXR, whose expression is elevated in the liverand intestine. When FXR binds to its ligand, it gets activatedFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68655Kunnumakkara et al. Googling the GuggulFIGURE 2 | Chemical constituents of Commiphora (guggul) and Boswellia (Salai guggul) (A) Commiphora (B) Boswellia.and reaches the cell nucleus, where it forms a heterodimerwith RXR. This heterodimer binds to the hormone responseelements on DNA and regulates various genes. FXR activationdownregulates cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), therate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis from cholesterol byinducing the expression of small heterodimer partner (SHP)which in turn inhibits the transcription of CYP7A1 gene. Whileobeticholic acid, fexaramine, cafestol, and chenodeoxycholic acidact as agonist of FXR; GS, from the gum resin of guggul hasalso been confirmed to inhibit pro-inflammatory signals, togetherwith transcription factor NF-\u03baB (Sharma and Sharma, 1977;Urizar et al., 2002; Shishodia et al., 2008; Yamada and Sugimoto,2016). Another study reported that the inhibitory activity ofNF-\u03baB is due to the binding of GS to the RH domain of NF-\u03baBprecursor protein p105 containing important sequences for DNAbinding and dimerization (Khan et al., 2013).B. serrata, commonly known as salai guggul, Indian olibanum,loban, or kundur, belongs to the Burseraceae family and is foundin dry mountainous regions of India, Northern Africa, and theMiddle East. Burseraceae family includes 17 genera and 600species of plants. The genus Boswellia has 25 different speciesdistributed throughout the tropical regions. B. serrata is one suchmedicinal plant which exhibits immense potential to combatvarious chronic disorders. The active pharmacological principleFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68656Kunnumakkara et al. Googling the Guggulof the oleo gum resin from the trees of different Boswelliaspecies is the BA (B\u00fcchele et al., 2003; Du et al., 2015; Royet al., 2016). The gum resin of the Boswellia species mainlyconsists of mucus, resin acids, and volatile oil with differentquantitative composition from species to species. The gum resinof salai guggul contains pentacyclic triterpenic acids, namely\u03b1-boswellic acids, \u03b2-boswellic acids, \u03b3-boswellic acid, acetyl-\u03b2-boswellic acid, 11-keto-\u03b2-boswellic acid (KBA), acetyl-11-keto-\u03b2-boswellic acid (AKBA), and tetracyclic triterpenic acids liketirucallic acids viz 3-oxotirucallic acid, 3-hydroxytirucallic acid,and 3-acetoxytirucallic acid (Figure 2B). Other oleo gum resincompounds which display biological activities are: betulinicacid, lupenoic acid, epi-lupeol, isoincensole, isoincensole acetateand 1-ursene-2-diketone-incensole acetate along with few otherterpenes that can be found in volatile oil (Du et al., 2015; Ammon,2016; Roy et al., 2016).MOLECULAR TARGETS OF COMMIPHORAAND BOSWELLIAGS suppresses the physiological action of the FXR which isa nuclear hormone receptor that controls the synthesis andtransport of bile acid (Sinal and Gonzalez, 2002; Urizar et al.,2002). However, it increases the transcription of bile salt exportpump (BSEP) which is majorly involved in hepatic bile acidtransport (Cui et al., 2003). Besides regulating transport of bileacid, GS is a potent anti-inflammatory agent which suppressesLPS-induced NO production (Meselhy, 2003). GS has also beenreported to inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB by suppressing thelevels of receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) (Ichikawaand Aggarwal, 2006). In 2004, Shishodia and group reportedthat GS suppressed the activation of NF-\u03baB and I\u03baB-\u03b1 kinaseand exhibited antiproliferative activity by inhibiting c-Myc andcyclin D1. Furthermore, GS has also been found to exert anti-metastatic effect through reducing the levels of MMP-9, COX-2, and VEGF (Shishodia and Aggarwal, 2004). This group alsoreported that GS induced apoptosis bymodulating the expressionof anti-apoptotic genes, IAP1, XIAP, Bcl-2, cFLIP, Bfl-1/A1, andsurvivin (Shishodia and Aggarwal, 2004). Further, GS has alsobeen found to induce tumor cell apoptosis by activating theapoptotic genes, caspase-3,\u22128,\u22129, and inducing the release ofcytochrome c, cleavage of bid and PARP. This was controlled byactivated mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MKK4) mediatedupregulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and suppressionof Akt. The antiproliferative activity of GS was found to besupported by reduced levels of cyclin D1, cdc2, and simultaneousupregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27(Figure 3A; Shishodia et al., 2007).Boswellic acid is known to inhibit leukotriene synthesis byinhibiting 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) (Safayhi et al., 1992, 1995;Ammon et al., 1993). This 5-LOX inhibitor has also been foundto reduce the activity of human leukocyte elastase (HLE) in vitro(Safayhi et al., 1997). Suppression of these molecules contributesto anti-inflammatory action of Boswellia. Boswellia is also knownto induce apoptosis in cancer cells. In 2007, Bhushan and groupreported that a triterpenediol from B. serrata induced apoptosisin HL-60 cells through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways(Bhushan et al., 2007). In the first case, the triterpenediol wasfound to disturb the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduceBcl-2/Bax ratio and cause release of AIF, Smac/DIABLO, andcytochrome c from the mitochondria along with suppressionof survivin and upregulation of caspases-3,\u22128, and\u22129, therebyleading to the cleavage of ICAD and PARP while in the secondcase, the oxidative stress generated in the cells due to excessiveROS and NO production triggered the activation of TNF-R1and DR4 followed by activation of caspase-8. Another study inmultiple myeloma cells also suggested that BA acetate inducesapoptosis by upregulating death receptor proteins, DR4 and DR5which subsequently leads to the activation of caspase-8 followedby caspase-3 (Xia et al., 2005). The role of DR5-mediated pathwaywhich involves activation of CAAT/enhancer binding proteinhomologous protein (CHOP) was reported in AKBA-mediatedapoptosis of prostate cancer cells (Lu et al., 2008). Caspase-8activation has also been reported in other BA-induced apoptosisstudies (Liu et al., 2002a,b). In 2002, Park et al. hypothesized thatAKBA contributed in the process of proliferation and apoptosisof tumors by inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK-1and ERK-2) (Park et al., 2002b). BA mediated apoptosis has alsobeen evident in cancer cells via activation of p21, an importantcell cycle regulator protein (Glaser et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2006).Apart from this, AKBA has been found to interfere with IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling via protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1subsequently causing downregulation of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and VEGF, thus impeding proliferation, survival andangiogenesis of multiple myeloma cells (Kunnumakkara et al.,2009). Moreover, BA has also been found to suppress metastaticgrowth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), chemokinereceptor; CXCR4 and angiogenic factor; VEGFR 2 (Singh et al.,2007; Pang et al., 2009; Park et al., 2011a). Further, in vivo studieshave unveiled that BA regulates proliferation and metastasis ofcancer cells by downregulating other targets like COX-2, c-Myc,cyclin D1, MMP-9, VEGF, ICAM-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, andcellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (IAP-1) (Park et al.,2011a,b; Yadav et al., 2012). Most of these genes are regulated bythe transcription factor, NF-\u03baB which is also downregulated byBA (Syrovets et al., 2005a,b; Takada et al., 2006). Furthermore,BA has also been shown to regulate the activity of P-glycoprotein(Pgp) which is an important class of drug transporters (Weberet al., 2006). It is also an inhibitor of topoisomerases I and II incancer cells (Hoernlein et al., 1999; Syrovets et al., 2000; Zhaoet al., 2003). The anticancer activity of this potential compoundalso involves regulation of let-7 and miR-200 microRNA family(Figure 3B; Takahashi et al., 2012).THERAPEUTIC PROPERTIES OF GUGGULCongregate evidences show guggul to be profoundly effectiveagainst diverse chronic diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease,arthritis, cancer, pancreatitis, IBD, dermatitis, diabetes, infectiousdiseases, intestinal metaplasia, otitis media, respiratorydiseases, asthma, psoriasis, gingivitis etc. Besides, it alsoFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68657Kunnumakkara et al.

V. et al., 2007; Shah et al., 2012; Roy et al.,2016). GS induced apoptosis in cancer cells via inhibition ofNF-\u03baB, activation of JNK and downregulation of Akt and anti-apoptotic proteins (Shishodia and Aggarwal, 2004; Shishodiaet al., 2007). Treatment with GS led to the inhibition of DNAsynthesis and proliferation of leukemia cells via downregulationof cyclin D1, cdc2, and upregulation of p21 and p27 (Samudioet al., 2005; Shishodia et al., 2007). In addition, B. serrata gumresin displayed cytostatic and apoptosis-inducing effect againstleukemia and brain tumor cells (Hostanska et al., 2002). Further,GS induced cell death in prostate cancer cells by reactive oxygenintermediate (ROI)-dependent activation of JNK, p38MAPK andalso activation of ERK1/2 (Singh S. V. et al., 2007; Xiao andSingh, 2008). Additionally, AKBA inhibited the proliferation andFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68658Kunnumakkara et al.

Besides, it alsomodulated the expression of let-7, miR-200 families and theirdownstream targets in colon cancer cells (Takahashi et al., 2012).Apart from cancer, the effect of guggul has been well provenagainst different inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoidarthritis, IBD, and various other diseases such as obesity,otitis media, uveitis etc. For example, treatment with GSdownregulated RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis and blockedIL-1beta mediated production of chemokines and epithelialneutrophil activating peptide-78 (ENA-78), MMP-1,-3 viasuppression of NF-\u03baB, nuclear p50, and p65 subunit and I\u03baB\u03b1degradation in rheumatoid arthritis (Ichikawa and Aggarwal,2006; Kinne et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2008; Ammon, 2016). Astudy conducted by Cheon and group on IBD showed thatGS inhibited IL-1beta- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- inducedICAM-1 expression, NF-\u03baB transcription activity and I\u03baBphosphorylation/degradation in humanCaco-2 cells and rat non-transformed IEC-18 cells (Cheon et al., 2006). Further, treatmentwith GS alone showed increase in apoptosis and lipolysis andits combination with genistein resulted in increased cleavageof procaspase-3, PARP, expression of Bax, release of cyt-c andprevented lipid accumulation in maturing adipocytes resulting ininhibition of adipogenesis (Yang et al., 2007, 2008). GS exertedits effect against otitis media, the foremost cause of hearingimpairment in children by inhibiting LPS-induced upregulationof TNF-\u03b1 expression, COX-2 production and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation(Ovesen and Ledet, 1992; Barrett et al., 2003; Song et al., 2010).In case of uveitis, treatment with GS inhibited LPS-inducedexpression of inflammatory proteins in human primary non-pigment ciliary epithelial cells (Kalariya et al., 2010).As guggul is an FXR antagonist, it is used extensively as acholesterol-lowering agent (Rizzo et al., 2006; Shah et al., 2012).GS eliminated the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), anFXR agonist on the expression of Cdx2 and MUC2 and thusprevented bile acid induced gastric intestinal metaplasia andcarcinogenesis (Xu et al., 2010). Oswley and Chiang reportedthat GS antagonizes FXR induction of BSEP but activatespregnane X receptor to inhibit CYP7A1 gene (Owsley andChiang, 2003). In addition, Commiphora and Boswellia showedpotent cardioprotective as well as thyroid-stimulatory effects(Singh et al., 1982; Deng, 2007). For instance, GS inhibitedDOX induced cytotoxicity, reduced apoptosis, and intracellularROS and formation of MDA in DOX-treated H9C2 cells (WangFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68661Kunnumakkara et al. Googling the Guggulet al., 2012). In addition, triterpenes and prenylaromadendrane-type diterpenes from the gum resin of B. carterii was shownto exert hepatoprotective effect against d-galactosamine-inducedliver cell damage (Wang et al., 2013, 2016).IN VIVO STUDIES WITH COMMIPHORAAND BOSWELLIA AND THEIR ROLE INDIFFERENT CHRONIC DISEASESPromising after effects of Commiphora and Boswellia againstvarious chronic diseases in the in vitro setting has led toa handful of in vivo studies where the efficacy of guggulwas evaluated in different experimental models of diversechronic diseases such as cancer, inflammatory, cardiovascular,and metabolic diseases, atherosclerosis, asthma etc. (Table 2;Figure 4). Recently, several studies have reported the anti-tumorefficacy of guggul in different cancers such as cancers of breast,esophagus, head, and neck, pancreas, prostate etc. (An et al.,2009). For instance, AKBA was found to prevent intestinaltumorigenesis and exert chemopreventive effect via inhibitionof wnt/\u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB/COX-2 signaling pathways (Liuet al., 2013; Wang R. et al., 2014). Another study showed AKBAto function via modulation of let-7 and miR-200 downstreamgenes in colorectal (CRC) tumors (Takahashi et al., 2012).In case of breast cancer, treatment with GS increased thechemosensitivity of MCF-7/DOX cells to doxorubicin in vivothrough inhibition of Bcl-2 and Pgp (Xu et al., 2014b). Inaddition, GS suppressed esophageal tumor cell viability viainhibition of FXR and prevented the growth of esophagealcancer cells significantly in combination with amiloride in vivo(Guan et al., 2013, 2014). Furthermore, in case of glioma, cyanoenone of methyl boswellates (CEMB), and 3-\u03b1-propionyloxy-\u03b2-boswellic acid (POBA) significantly inhibited the tumor growthin murine models (Ravanan et al., 2011; Qurishi et al., 2013).Again, topical application of Boswellin (BE); B. serrata gum resinexudate inhibited skin inflammation, epidermal proliferation,and tumor promotion induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mice. Additionally, treatment with guggulipid wasshown to cause reduced growth of HNSCC cells in vivo (Leeman-Neill et al., 2009). Besides, GS enhanced the antitumor efficacyof gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer via modulation of Akt, NF-\u03baB, and apoptosis-related proteins (Ahn et al., 2012). In caseof prostate cancer as well, guggul has been found to be highlyeffective in vivo (Syrovets et al., 2005b; B\u00fcchele et al., 2006;Pang et al., 2009; Pathania et al., 2015). Oral administration ofguggulsterone prevented in vivo angiogenesis of prostate cancercells through suppression of VEGF-VEGF-R2-Akt signaling(Xiao and Singh, 2008).Apart from cancer, the efficacy of guggul was well proven indifferent inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, colitis, gastritis,IBD, pancreatitis, uveitis etc. (Sharma et al., 1989; Cheon et al.,2006; Xiao and Singh, 2008; Mencarelli et al., 2009; Kalariyaet al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010, 2013; Dhaneshwar et al., 2013; Kanget al., 2013; Wang R. et al., 2014). In case of rheumatoid arthritis,treatment with guggul decreased the thickness of joint swelling,reduced the infiltration of leucocytes into the pleural cavity,suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased beta-glucuronidase activity in vivo (Sharma and Sharma, 1977; Reddyand Dhar, 1987; Sharma et al., 1989; Fan et al., 2005). In addition,guggul reduced the severity of IBD via inhibition of LPS- orIL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 gene expression and NF-\u03baB activity(Krieglstein et al., 2001; Cheon et al., 2006; Mencarelli et al., 2009;Kim et al., 2010). Furthermore, administration of GS resulted inmitigation of histological damage, suppressed serum lipase levels,inhibition of infiltrations of neutrophils, and macrophages anddecreased cytokine production in pancreatitis (Kim et al., 2015).Moreover, GS inhibited the expression of endotoxin-induceduveitis (EIU)-associated inflammatory markers such as MMP-2,NO, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Kalariya et al., 2010).Guggul exhibited profound cardioprotective effects aswell in vivo (Chander et al., 2003). It decreased the lipidperoxide, creatine phosphokinase, phospholipase, xanthineoxidase activities, and total cholesterol level in the serum;increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), myocardial antioxidants,glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), catalase (CAT); reducedglutathione (GSH), creatine-phosphokinase-MB (CK-MB),and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as reversed thecardiac damage induced by isoproterenol (Kaul and Kapoor,1989; Batra et al., 2000; Ojha et al., 2011). The hypolipidemiceffect of guggul has also been well studied in different animalmodels (Khanna et al., 1969; Dixit et al., 1980; Baldwa et al.,1981; Lata et al., 1991). Guggul diminished hyperlipidemiavia inhibition of FXR activation. In high-fat-diet-fed mice,treatment with GS improved blood glucose in fasting condition,plasma insulin level, glucose tolerance, level of harmful lipids,phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase,and other proteins like glucose transporter-4, PPARc, and TNF-\u03b1(Satyavati et al., 1969; Singh et al., 1990; Urizar et al., 2002;Cui et al., 2003; Sharma et al., 2009; Tripathi, 2009). Further,C. opobalsamum, C. mukul, B. serrata, and B. ovalifoliolataspecies mitigated hepatic damage and displayed protectiveeffect against lipid peroxidation and deviated serum enzymaticvariables (Al-Howiriny et al., 2004; Y et al., 2006; Mahesh et al.,2014). In addition, GS reversed neuronal damage and memorydeficits in mice by increasing glutathione level in the brains,antiacetylcholine esterase, and antioxidant activities (Saxenaet al., 2007). Apart from these, administration of GS was found toincrease thyroid function by enhancing iodine uptake, improvedthe activities of thyroid peroxidase, and protease and amelioratedhypothyroidism through its ability to increase thyroid hormonein vivo (Tripathi et al., 1975, 1984; Panda and Kar, 2005).Taken together, these pre-clinical studies provide substantialevidence of the enormous potential of guggul as a multi-targetedagent for the prevention and treatment of different chronicdiseases.CLINICAL STUDIES WITH COMMIPHORAAND BOSWELLIA AND THEIR ROLE INDIFFERENT CHRONIC DISEASESSeveral clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate theeffect of \u201cguggul\u201d from Commiphora and Boswellia onvarious chronic disorders.

Googling the Guggulbeen found to be effective against different diseases such asasthma, breast fibroadenoma, chronic kidney disease, colitis,Crohn\u2019s disease, fascioliasis, hepatitis C, hypercholesterolaemia,hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, nodulocystic acne,arthritis, schistosomiasis, stress urinary incontinence etc.(Table 3; Figure 4).ArthritisArthritis is mainly caused due to inflammation of joints, thetissues surrounding the joints and other connective tissues.Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis whichaffects a wide range of people across all the places. As guggulhas been reported to exhibit high affectivity against arthritispre-clinically; hence, its effect was evaluated in the clinicalsetting as well. In one such study, 30 patients with arthritiswere treated with gum guggul for 1 month which resultedin remarkable improvement in the total scores of WesternOntario and MacMaster Osteoarthritis Index and condition ofthe patients (Singh et al., 2003). Another study was conductedby Kimmatkar et al., to check the safety, tolerability, and efficacyof B. serrata extract in 30 patients with knee osteoarthritis. Thepatients receiving drug treatment reported a decrease in kneepain and swelling of the knee joint as well as increased kneeflexion and walking distance (Kimmatkar et al., 2003).AsthmaAsthma is a chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease of therespiratory tract and is one of the major health concern. Notably,Boswellia has been found to be effective in the treatment of thisdisease. In a clinical study, 40 patients having 23 males, and 17females in the age range of 18\u201375 years, suffering from bronchialasthma were treated with 300mg of gum resin thrice daily fora period of 6 weeks. This led to improved prognosis in around70% of the patients as various signs and symptoms of bronchialasthma like rhonchi, dyspnoea, and attacks disappeared upontreatment (Gupta et al., 1998).Breast FibroadenomasBreast fibroadenoma accounts for the majority of breast lumpsin young women. Boswellia was found to exert beneficialeffect against breast fibroadenomas as evinced by a studyconducted by Pasta and group. They showed that treatmentwith the combination of Boswellia, betaine, and myo-inositolresulted in decreased fibroadenoma dimension in young womenwithout exerting any toxic effects. The combination also resultedin reduced fibroadenoma volume in 38.8% of the patientsin the experimental group, whereas the same was observedonly in 17.85% patients in the placebo group (Pasta et al.,2016).Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs)CVDs, a group of diseases which involves the heart and theblood vessels is one of the most common causes of deathacross the globe. Notably, guggul presents a potent remedy forcardiovascular diseases. For example, Singh and group conducteda study to evaluate the cardioprotective benefits of guggul byenrolling 200 patients suffering from ischemic heart disease. Thepatients were treated with the combination of gum guggul andInula racemosa for 6 months which resulted in the reduced levelsof total cholesterol, triglyceride, and total blood lipids in thepatients. It also restored the normal electrocardiogram (ECG) in26% of the patients, showed improvement of ECG in 59% of thepatients and lessened the chest pain in 25% of the patients (Singhet al., 1993).Chronic Kidney DiseaseChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease whereoccurs due to enhanced inflammation and oxidative stressleading to reduced kidney function. Studies have indicated B.serrata in combination with Curcuma longa as an effectiveregimen to obtain reduced inflammation in patients with CKDwhich functioned via modulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)(Shelmadine et al., 2017). Moreover, this regimen was foundto be safe, well tolerated which also enhanced the levels ofinflammatory cytokines in CKD patients (Moreillon et al., 2013).Diabetes MellitusA large population of the world is affected by diabetes mellitusor type 2 diabetes. Several preclinical studies have shown thatthe gum resin of commiphora and boswellia are highly effectiveagainst this disease. In a clinical study conducted byAhangarpouret al., it was observed that the treatment of patients withdiabetes mellitus with B. serrata gum resin (900mg daily for 6weeks orally) resulted in decreased risk factors associated withthis disease. Further, the treatment also helped in maintainingfructosamine levels, hepatic enzyme activities, and to bring lipidprofiles close to normal levels in the patients (Ahangarpour et al.,2014).Eczema and PsoriasisEczema, also known as dermatitis and psoriasis are causedmainlydue to inflammation of the skin. Boswellia has been found to exerteffectiveness against eczema and psoriasis. A group of scientistsrevealed that Boswellia-based cream lessens the use of topicalcorticosteroids and can diminish the grade of erythema andthe skin superficial symptoms (Togni et al., 2015). Further, ina double blind study, the efficacy of a novel formulation of BA(Bosexil R\u00a9) containing B. serrata resin extract and lecithin wasevaluated against both psoriasis and eczema. Improvement inpsoriasis, scales (70% of cases), and erythema (50% of cases) wasobserved with Bosexil R\u00a9 compared to placebo. In addition, wheneczema patients were administrated with Bosexil R\u00a9 formulation,it showed improvement in both erythema (60% of cases) and itch(60% of cases) of the patients without any case of waning (Togniet al., 2014).FascioliasisFascioliasis is a parasitic worm infection caused by thecommon liver fluke Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. Theformulation of myrhh, the gum resisn of Commiphora molmolwas reported to be safe, well tolerated, and effective for themanagement of this disease. The formulated drug comprised of8 parts of resin and 3.5 parts of volatile oils, all extracted frommyrrh. They observed that 7 patients who were passing fasciolaFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68664Kunnumakkara et al.

Frankincense extract has been found toexhibit efficacy against gingivitis. A double blinded randomizedplacebo controlled trial was conducted among 75 female patientsaged between 15 and 18 years with moderate plaque-inducedgingivitis. Six groups were randomly formed based on theadministration of 0.1 g of frankincense extract, 0.2 g of itspowder, placebo, and whether the patients have undergonescaling and root planning (SRP) or not. Gingival index, plaqueindex, bleeding index, and probing pocket depth were measuredon the 0, 7th, and 14th days of the study.

Googling the Guggulfrankincense extract or powder might cause significant decreasein inflammatory indices in comparison to the groups withoutdrug therapy and SRP (Khosravi Samani et al., 2011).Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseDifferent clinical studies with guggul have shown its efficacyagainst IBDs which include colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Forinstance, the gum resin of B. serrata was found to be effectivein the treatment of chronic colitis with minimal side effects ina clinical study conducted by Gupta et al. In this study, thepatients with chronic colitis were treated with gum resin fromB. serrata at a dose of 900mg daily divided in three dosesfor 6 weeks. The treatment resulted in the improvement ofstool properties, hemoglobin, serum iron, calcium, phosphorus,proteins, total leukocytes, and eosinophils in the patients(Gupta et al., 2001). Further, a double-blind, placebo-controlled,randomized, parallel study on 82 patients with Crohn\u2019s diseasewas conducted where patients were given a new B. serrataextract; Boswelan. In this trial, remission was observed in 59.9%of the actively treated patients. Additionally, this study alsoconfirmed better tolerability of Boswelan in long-term treatmentof Crohn\u2019s disease (Holtmeier et al., 2011). Furthermore,leukotrienes play an important role in inflammation of thecolon in ulcerative colitis. Sallai guggul gum resin is knownto be specific, non-redox, and non-competitive inhibitors of5-LOX, a crucial enzyme of leukotriene biosynthesis. Patientswith grade II and III ulcerative colitis were treated with B.serrata gum resin at a dose of 350mg thrice daily for 6 weeks.Stool properties, histopathology, and scan microscopy of rectalbiopsies, blood parameters including hemoglobin, serum iron,calcium, phosphorus, proteins, total leukocytes, and eosinophilsshowed slightly better improvement in Boswellia treated patients(Gupta et al., 1997).Nodulocystic AcneGuggulipid is considered to be very effective in topical and oralcomplementary as well as an alternative medicine (CAM) forthe treatment of acne (Magin et al., 2006). In a clinical studyconducted by Thappa andDogra, patients with nodulocystic acnewere given guggulipid equivalent to 25mg GS for 3 months,which resulted in progressive reduction in lesions in majorityof patients. However, patients with oily faces displayed betterresponse to guggulipid (Thappa and Dogra, 1994).Thus, these clinical studies well evince the potential effectof Commiphora and Boswellia on different chronic diseases.However, more studies are inevitable to establish them as cuttingedge strategy for the treatment of diverse human diseases.CONCLUSIONSince ancient times, Commiphora and Boswellia are consideredas important traditional medicinal plants which are used for thetreatment of various ailments. Guggul isolated fromCommiphoraand Boswellia have immense therapeutic potential against severaldiseases and it has been well established by numerous in vitro,in vivo, and clinical studies. Guggul was used traditionallyfor the treatment of inflammation and hyperlipidemia, butwith the extensive studies on guggul and associated molecularmechanisms unveiled newer insights of its use for the treatmentof various other chronic diseases as well. Gum resin guggulpossesses multiple pharmacological activities especiallyhypolipidemic, antiobesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoreffects, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective,thyroid stimulatory effects etc. It effectively regulates differenttranscription factors, enzymes, cytokines, and anti-apoptoticproteins which are involved in inflammation, carcinogenesis, andother chronic diseases. Further, Commiphora in combinationwith other ayurvedic herbs is commercially available andmarketed for the treatment and cure of arthritis, obesity andassociated side effects of the disease. Many patents are alsofiled and approved to use guggul as a constituent of polyherbalformulations and cosmetics. Therefore, taking the medicinalimportance and commercial use of guggul into consideration,it can be advocated to possess substantial therapeutic potentialagainst diverse chronic disorders. However, more in vitro, invivo, and well-designed clinical studies are required to validatethe clinical usefulness of guggul and to obtain a potent herbalderived drug with enhanced efficacy, minimal side effects andstrong disease combating properties.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSBA and AK contributed to study design and writing of themanuscript.

R. rosea extract has a stimulatingeffect on the CNS, suggesting potential benefits on cognitive functions, memory,learning, and attention. The reproducible efficacy and quality of preparations ofthe underground parts of R. rosea depend on the highly variable content of theactive markers, salidroside and rosavin, which affect the quality of HMP and dietarysupplements. However, it is not clear which analytical markers are important forassessing the efficacy of R. rosea preparations intended for use in aging-induced mildcognitive disorders, such as attenuated memory, attention, and learning. Furthermore,the activity of various commercial R. rosea extracts has not been correlated with theircontent. Here, the biological activities of salidroside, rosavin, and seven commercialextracts of underground parts of R. rosea were assessed using a synaptic model ofmemory: long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in hippocampus slices.A high degree of variation in the content of all active markers was observed. Oneextract from China lacked rosavin, and there was even variation in the extracts fromthe Altai geographic region. In vitro, rosavin, salidroside and all tested R. rosea extractspotentiated electric stimulation of an intra-hippocampal electric circuit, which resultedin higher responses of the pyramidal cells in isolated hippocampus slices. Rosavinwas more active at higher concentrations than salidroside; while, salidroside was moreeffective at lower concentrations. The highest content of both active markers wasfound in the extracts that were active at the lowest concentrations tested; while, someextracts contained some other compounds that presumably reduced the efficacy dueto antagonistic interactions.

[Crassulaceae, syn. Sedum rhodiola - DC. Sedumrosea - (L.) Scop cop, known as roseroot, rosenroot, goldenroot, arctic root, orpin rose, rhodiole rouge\u00e2tre] (Currier andAmpong-Nyarko, 2015) has a long history as a valuable medicinalplant and has appeared in the Materia Medica of severalEuropean countries (Panossian et al., 2010). Rhodiola rosea L.roots and rhizome extracts are active ingredients in adaptogenicherbal medicinal products (HMP) and dietary supplements fortemporary relief of symptoms of stress, such as fatigue andweakness (Panossian and Wagner, 2005; Panossian and Wikman,2009, 2010, 2014; EFSA, 2010; Panossian et al., 2010; EuropeanMedicine Authority [EMA], 2011). A growing body of evidencehas indicated the extract\u2019s potential use in the prevention andtreatment of stress- and age-related impairments of cognitivefunctions and mental disorders (Panossian et al., 2010, 2014;Panossian, 2013; Panossian and Gerbarg, 2016; Amsterdam andPanossian, 2016; Nabavi et al., 2016). The stimulating effects ofR. rosea on the CNS were demonstrated long ago and suggestedthere were potential benefits on cognitive functions, memory,learning, and attention (Saratikov et al., 1965, 1978; Marina andAlekseeva, 1968; Kurkin and Zapesochnaya, 1986; Petkov et al.,1986; Marina et al., 1994; Saratikov and Krasnov, 2004). An activecompound, named rhodioloside was isolated and identified assalidroside (Aksenova et al., 1968; Saratikov et al., 1968). A pilotstudy of rhodioloside (syn. salidroside) in 46 healthy humanvolunteers showed that 2.5 mg salidroside increased attentionin cognitive tests 1 h after a single dose was administeredin 83% of subjects, compared with 54% of volunteers whowere administered placebo (Aksenova et al., 1968). Furtherstudies provided evidence that R. rosea and salidroside exhibitneuroprotective activity (Qu et al., 2009; Panossian et al., 2010,2012; Jacob et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013), suggesting they maybe effective in treating neurodegenerative disorders, such asAlzheimer\u2019s disease (Nabavi et al., 2016).Along with salidroside and its aglycone tyrosol (Figure 1),cinnamyl alcohol, glycosides, and rosavins (collective nameof rosavin, rosarin, and rosin) also exhibited stress-protective(Barnaulov et al., 1986), stimulating, and neurotropic activities inrodents; reduced sleep induced by barbital, hexanal, and chloralhydrate in mice (Sokolov et al., 1985, 1990); increased locomotoractivity in mice (Sokolov et al., 1990); and induced anti-depressant-like effects in animal models of depression (Panossianet al., 2008). Salidroside is common for all species of Rhodiola,while phenylpropanoids, rosavin, rosarin, and rosin are specificonly for R. rosea and R. sachalinensis (Kurkin et al., 1985;Nakamura et al., 2007; Booker et al., 2016b). Many publicationshave reported on the neuroprotective and neurotropic activityof salidroside (Sokolov et al., 1985, 1990; Barnaulov et al., 1986;Panossian et al., 2008; Cifani et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2013); while,there is limited evidence supporting the importance of rosavin,the major active marker (Sokolov et al., 1985, 1990; Panossianet al., 2008; Cifani et al., 2010; Marchev et al., 2017). Rosavinwas inactive is rats during a behavioral test of binge eating; while,salidroside dose-dependently reduced or abolished binge eatingfor the period in which it was elicited (Cifani et al., 2010). Inanother study, salidroside was more effective than rosarin androsin in inhibiting the expression of IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in microglialcells, while rosavin was not tested (Lee et al., 2013). Rosavininhibited the expression of the TNF-related apoptosis-inducingligand in concanavalin A activated Jurkat T cells, while salidrosidewas inactive and rosarin had an opposite effect (Marchev et al.,2017).It is unclear which analytical markers are important forassessing the quality and efficacy of R. rosea herbal preparationsintended for treating aging-induced mild cognitive disorders,such as attenuated memory, attention, and learning ability.Rhodiola preparations are usually standardized for salidroside(1%) and rosavin (3%). The content of active ingredients in herbalpreparations depends on many factors, such as the geographicand climate zone it was grown in, which season and under whatconditions it was harvested, and how it was dried, extracted,and prepared to give the final dosage form. For example, ahigh degree of inter-clonal variation was found for all testedconstituents (salidroside, tyrosol, rosavin, rosarin, rosin, andcinnamyl alcohol) in six samples of R. rosea roots collected invarious regions of Norway. The highest variation was foundfor salidroside and tyrosol, showing inter-clonal variations of92.8 and 87.8%, respectively (Hellum et al., 2010). Therefore,the preparations obtained by various producers can have quitedifferent active dose levels. Furthermore, the contribution ofthese active markers to the overall activity of the total extracts wasnot systematically assessed. It was suggested that these phenoliccompounds (rosavin, rosarin, rosin, salidroside/rhodioloside,and tyrosol) have no impact on activity of CYP450 enzymes anddo not inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP1A2 (Hellum et al.,2010; Xu et al., 2013; Thu et al., 2016a). The presence of minoramounts of herbacetin rhamnosides (rhodiosin and rhodionin)may presumably induce inhibition of CYP2D6 (Xu et al., 2013)in some commercial preparations of Rhodiola (Thu et al., 2016b,2017).It is a challenge to obtain reproducible efficacy and qualityof HMP, particularly for preparations of the underground partsof R. rosea (Panossian et al., 2010; Ioset et al., 2011; Bookeret al., 2016a). There may be unpredictable, complex interactionsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 42574fphar-09-00425 May 22, 2018 Time: 17:35 # 3Dimpfel et al. Quality Control of Rhodiola Extracts by BioassayFIGURE 1 | Chemical structures of active markers of R. rosea extracts.between the active constituents of the R. rosea extracts thataffect the regulation of molecular networks playing an importantrole in cellular and physiological functions of human organisms(Panossian et al., 2014). The pharmacological activity of R. roseacrude extract is related to many compounds, such as salidroside,tyrosol, rosavin, and other phenolic compounds (Sokolov et al.,1985, 1990; Barnaulov et al., 1986; Panossian et al., 2008; Leeet al., 2013; Marchev et al., 2017). The batch to batch reproduciblecontent of key active markers and the UPLC fingerprint arenot a guaranty of reproducible efficacy and safety. Additionalbioassays are required to assure reproducible pharmacologicalactivity of HMP. These bioassays may serve as validation toolsfor the quality assurance of complex HMP where the total extractcontains active pharmaceutical ingredients. In this context,assessment of the correlation between the content of activemarkers and pharmacological activity of HMP is important.Although the dose-response relationship of salidroside androsavin and dietary supplements was studied (Cifani et al., 2010;Lee et al., 2013; Marchev et al., 2017), to the our best of ourknowledge, the correlation between the content and biologicalactivity of various commercial R. rosea extracts has not beeninvestigated.The aim of our study was to assess the biological activity ofa selection of commercial extracts of the underground parts ofR. rosea and their analytical markers, salidroside and rosavin,in a synaptic model of memory: the long-term potentiation(LTP) of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (Bliss andCollingridge, 1993). An interesting result using this model wasthe ability of memantine, a substance used in the treatmentof dementia, to increase the population spike amplitude inresponse to single stimuli (SS) and to increase LTP (Dimpfel,1995). We used this method earlier for characterization ofelectrophysiological response of R. rosea in hippocampal slicesand have demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase ofthe amplitude of the population spike (Dimpfel et al., 2016b).These results relate very well to previous clinical results whereneurophysiological effects of R. rosea extract in healthy subjectswere characterized (Dimpfel, 2014).MATERIALS AND METHODSTest SamplesSeven dry commercial extracts were obtained from differentsuppliers via the Internet. Our selection strategy was to compareRhodiola extracts containing glycosides of cinnamyl alcohols(rosavins) with extracts containing only tyrosol and its glycosidesalidroside. Some of the extracts were from plants grown inthe Altai mountains of Siberia. The samples consisted of bulkpowders, obtained from water. According to the manufacturers\u2019certificates of analysis and origin, they were hydroalcoholicextracts of R. rosea roots and rhizome (harvest of 2015). Sixextracts were preparations containing only root and rhizomepowders, while one, SHR-5 contained maltodextrin as a carrier(for details see Supplementary Data S1 and Table 1). Ourinclusion criteria were that products must be consumed as asolid dose or soft-gel manufactured item. Our exclusion criteriaincluded ethanolic tinctures and raw materials including driedroots, rhizomes, and bulk tinctures. Rhodiola SHR-5 extract hasbeen previously tested for efficacy and safety (Panossian andWikman, 2014) and was included as a control (i.e., registeredor licensed product). The samples of R. rosea L. roots andrhizomes extracts were identified by thin-layer chromatography(TLC) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)using salidroside, tyrosol, rosavin, rosarin, rosin, and cinnamylalcohol as reference standards (Supplementary Data S2).

The solvents (water, methanol,and acetonitrile) used for extraction and chromatographywere high performance liquid chromatographic grade (WatersCorporation, United States and Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).Preparation of the Analytical andReference Standard SamplesPowdered extract (0.3 g) was dissolved in 25 mL of solventsystem water:acetonitrile (90:10) using an ultrasonic bath for30 min. It was then filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m pore size filterand analyzed by UPLC. Powdered extract (1 g) was dissolved in10 mL of methanol using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min througha 00H filter. The filtrate was applied (10 \u00b5L) to high performanceTLC (HPTLC) plates. Stock solutions of the reference standard(2 mg/mL) in methanol was further diluted with methanol to200 \u00b5g/mL, 20 \u00b5g/mL, 2 \u00b5g/mL, 200 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and2 ng/mL.Analytical MethodsThe R. rosea extracts were analyzed with two basicchromatographic techniques \u2013 HPTLC and UPLC. Quantitativeanalysis of extracts was performed using a UPLC method,validated for linearity (Correlation coefficient R > 0.999),repeatability and the levels 50, 100, and 150% (RSD < 5%),intermediate precision at different days and analysts (RSD< 5%),accuracy (recovery in the range from 90 to 110%), selectivity(peak purity angle less than purity threshold with resolution> 2),range from 80 to 120% and robustness (RSD< 2%). Actual resultsare shown in tabulated form in the Supplementary Data S1,Table 2. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ)of UPLC methods were evaluated by calculations based uponthe standard deviation of the response (\u03c3) and the slope (S) ofcalibration curve and the following formulas: LOD = 3.3 \u03c3/S andLOQ = 10 \u03c3/S. The specificity, generally defined as the abilityof the UPLC methods to unequivocally assess the sample ofinterest in the presence of potential interferences, was evaluatedin accordance with the new regulatory guideline (USP 25). Inaddition to the evaluation of the resolution between the samplepeak and the next peak, a peak purity test based on photodiodearray (PDA) detection was tested to demonstrate that the samplewas pure with no co-eluting impurities. Specificity of the TLCmethod was based on the colors and Rf value of referencestandards bands on the TLC plates visualized as described below.UPLC MethodAnalytical instrumentation and chromatography detailsThe UPLC fingerprints of the Rhodiola extracts were analyzedusing a Waters Acquity UPLC system consisting of QuaternaryPumps Manager, Sample Manager, Column Manager, PhotodiodeDetector, and Empower 3 software (Waters Corporation,Milford, MA, United States).

Quality Control of Rhodiola Extracts by Bioassayallow recording of in vitro activity from slices during theactive phase of their circadian rhythm (Dimpfel et al., 1994).Animals were exsanguinated under ether anesthesia, the brainwas removed in total and the hippocampal formation wasisolated under a microstereoscopic vision system. The midsectionof the hippocampus was fixed to the table of a vibratingmicrotome (Rhema Labortechnik, Hofheim, Germany) usinga cyanoacrylate adhesive, submerged in chilled bicarbonate-buffered saline [artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF): NaCl:124 mM, KCl: 5 mM, CaCl2: 2 mM, MgSO4: 2 mM, NaHCO3:26 mM, glucose: 10 mM], and cut into slices of 400\u00b5m thickness.All slices were pre-incubated for at least 1 h in Carbogen saturatedACSF (pH 7.4) in a pre-chamber before use (Dimpfel et al., 1991).The stimulation of Schaffer Collaterals leads to release ofglutamate, resulting in excitation of the postsynaptic pyramidalcells. The result of the electrical stimulation is recorded asa so-called population spike. The amplitude of the resultingpopulation spike represents the number of recruited pyramidalcells. The response of the pyramidal cells to electric stimulationin the form of the amplitude of the population spike indicatesactivation as increase of the amplitude as reported earlier forSideritis extract (Dimpfel et al., 2016a) or calming and sedatingeffects (attenuation of the amplitude). Of special interest is theresponse to theta burst stimulation (TBS) resulting in LTP, whichrelates to an increase of time- and space-dependent memory.During the experiment, the slices were held and treated ina special super-fusion chamber (List Electronics, Darmstadt,Germany) (Haas et al., 1979) at 35\u25e6C (Schiff and Somjen, 1985).The preparation was super-fused with ACSF at 180\u2013230 mL/h.Electrical stimulation (200 \u00b5A constant current pulses of 200 \u00b5spulse width) of the Schaffer Collaterals within the CA2 area andrecording of extracellular field potentials from the pyramidal celllayer of CA1 (Dimpfel et al., 1991) was performed according toconventional electrophysiological methods using the \u201cLabteam\u201dComputer system \u201cNeuroTool\u201d software package (MediSystGmbH, Linden, Germany). Measurements were performed at10 min intervals to avoid potentiation mechanisms. Fourstimulations, each 20 s apart, were averaged for each timepoint. After obtaining three stable responses to SS, LTP wasinduced by applying a TBS. The mean amplitudes of threesignals were averaged to give the mean of absolute voltage values(Microvolt) \u00b1 standard error (SE) of the mean for four slices forone of the experimental conditions. Four slices were used per day.Statistical AnalysisThe results are reported as means \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) or\u00b1SE for the indicated number of experiments. The significanceof differences between samples and controls was determinedwith one-way independent measures ANOVA, followed by thepost hoc Tukey\u2019s test for multiple comparisons. The correlationswere evaluated using F-test. All calculations were performedusing GraphPad (San Diego, CA, United States) Prism software(version 3.03) for Windows. GraphPad Prism was also used forsupplemental graphs. All statistical tests were two-sided tests withp-values< 0.05 regarded as significant (Supplementary Data S3).Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney U test was also used throughoutall experimental data for comparison to results obtained byvehicle administration at the particular timing with respect toelectrophysiological data (Supplementary Data S4).RESULTSUPLC and HPTLC Metabolite ProfilingRepresentative UPLC and HPTLC fingerprints of two R. roseaextracts, EPR-7 and the reference standard SHR-5, are shownin Figures 2, 3. They are almost identical except for thepeaks corresponding to rosavins, which are higher on thechromatogram of EPR-7 (Figure 2) and the presence of somefluorescent compounds in SHR-5, which are absent in EPR-7(Figure 3).The contents of all active markers in all studied extracts(Table 1) were quite different, with a lack of rosavin, rosin, androsarin in one extract from China. Even the extracts from thesame geographic region \u2013 Altai (Russia) differed; e.g., the contentof rosavin in Alt-X was 100-fold lower (0.03%) compared withSHR-5 (3.1%) or EPR-7 (3.7%), despite that all other phenyl- andethyl propanoids were within common limits. This may have asignificant impact on the activity of the Rhodiola Alt-X extractin T cell activation and apoptosis (Marchev et al., 2017). Overall,the highest content of rosavin and salidroside was in the RhodiolaEPR-7 extract.Electrophysiological Activity in aSynaptic Model of Memory:Hippocampal Long-Term PotentiationFigure 4 shows the concentration-dependent effects ofsalidroside and rosavin on pyramidal cell activity in termsFIGURE 3 | High performance TLC (HPTLC) fingerprint of extracts exposed toUV 366 nm, after derivatization with 10% sulfuric acid in methanol.

In the presence of salidroside, the amplitudesof the population spike were enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. During SS, amplitudes reached about 2.3 mVand about 4.3 mV during TBS. At 0.5 mg/L, salidroside wasmore effective than rosavin in the TBS test, while at the higherconcentrations of 0.75 and 1.5 mg/L, the effect of rosavin wassuperior (Figure 4, upper part).A comparison of the Rhodiola extract Chi-R, containingthe phenyl ethanoids, tyrosol and salidroside, with the extractscontaining both salidroside and rosavin, e.g., Chi-R vs. RhodiolaEPR-7, demonstrated that the content of salidroside in bothextracts was almost the same 2.5\u20133.0%, while the content ofrosavin in EPR-7 was 3.5-fold higher than in Chi-R (Table 1).That is in line with results where the EPR-7 extract was as active asChi-R at a 2.5-fold lower concentration (Figure 4, lower part, andFigure 5). Figure 5 shows that EPR-7 was the most active extractat 5 mg/L, which corresponds to a concentration of rosavin of0.18 mg/L (0.4 \u00b5M).The EC50 values (Table 2) were calculated during SS andTBS. All results were fitted using a hyperbolic tangent functionto give EC50 values (effective concentration to induce a half-maximal effect). The lower the EC50 values, the less compound isneeded to exert its pharmacological effect. The lower the effectiveconcentration, the less side effects are expected. According to thisbioassay, the EPR-7 extract had the lowest EC50 value amongthe seven Rhodiola extracts compared in this study (Table 2 andFigures 5, 6).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we compared the biological activity of variouscommercial extracts of R. rosea in a synaptic model of memory:Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 42579fphar-09-00425 May 22, 2018 Time: 17:35 # 8Dimpfel et al.

The details of statisticalanalysis see in Supplementary Data S3.the LTP of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (Bliss andCollingridge, 1993). Synaptic transmission is critical in learning,memory, and functioning of the nervous system. As memoriesare thought to be determined by alteration of synaptic strength, apersistent increase in synaptic strength following high-frequencystimulation of a chemical synapse (LTP) is generally consideredone of the major cellular mechanisms that triggers learning andmemory.When comparing the content of rosavin and/or salidrosidein seven extracts with their EC50 values (Table 2), one canconclude that the EPR-7 extract, which has the highest contentof both active markers, was active at the lowest concentrations.However, this correlation did not apply to other extracts, e.g.,SHR-5, which presumably contained compounds that reducedthe overall efficacy of the total extracts (Figure 3). Activecompounds other than rosavin or salidroside might account forthe efficacy of the extracts in this bioassay through synergisticor antagonistic modes of action. In this study, the brainslice is exposed directly to the samples, circumventing theblood\u2013brain barrier. However, both preclinical and clinicalstudies have proven that Rhodiola extract exerts actions onthe brain, suggesting enough compound passes the blood\u2013brainbarrier.The efficacy of Rhodiola SHR-5 extract was demonstratedpreviously on healthy subjects (Spasov et al., 2000; Shevtsovet al., 2003; Dimpfel, 2014), subjects experiencing stress andfatigue (Darbinyan et al., 2000), and patients with chronicfatigue (Olsson et al., 2009) and major depressive disorder(Darbinyan et al., 2007; Mao et al., 2015). In a doubleblind, placebo-controlled study on 20 healthy subjects, Dimpfeldemonstrated that a single dose administration of two capsulescontaining 200 mg R. rosea SHR-5 extract changed thespectral signature of electric brain activity in a stimulatingway compared with placebo. The effect was regarded as asafe booster of mental activity during cognitive and emotionalchallenges. Rhodiola EPR-7 extract was also studied earlierin isolated skeletal muscle cells (Hern\u00e1ndez-Santana et al.,2014), animals (Dimpfel et al., 2016b), and healthy humansubjects (Shanely et al., 2014; Ahmed et al., 2015). Oraladministration of 100 mg/kg of R. rosea root extract led tosignificant attenuation of \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b4, and \u03b8 waves of theelectropharmacograms, which are associated with the activationof dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, andnorepinephrine-mediated signaling pathways (Dimpfel et al.,2016b). The most affected were \u03b12 (dopaminergic transmission \u2013CNS stimulating effect) and \u03b21 (glutaminergic transmission \u2013CNS stimulating effect) in the frontal cortex. The next strongestchanges were seen in the striatum, and the weakest changes inthe reticular formation. Spectral changes lasted up to 4 h afteradministration.These results are in line with those of our recent publication,where we evaluated the effects of Rhodiola extract and salidrosideon gene expression profiling in the T98G human neurogliacell line (Panossian et al., 2014). The most significantlyaffected canonical pathways across the entire dataset, whichcontains the 1062 genes deregulated by Rhodiola and salidroside,were G-protein coupled receptor signaling, glutamate receptorsignaling, ephrin receptor signaling, cAMP-mediated pathways,and dopamine signaling pathways associated with the expressionof cell survival genes (Panossian et al., 2014). A meta-analysison the putative antidepressant action of Rhodiola extractrevealed it was effective on major depressive disorder (146subjects) and stress-induced mild depression (714 individuals)(Amsterdam and Panossian, 2016). Rosavin was not includedin that study. The results of our study are in line witha previous publication where the LTP effect of Rhodiolaextract was tested in vitro in the hippocampal slice (Dimpfelet al., 2016b). A concentration of 5 mg/L induced a slightincrease in the amplitude of the population spike andan increase in LTP. Further increases were observed byincreasing the concentration up to 30 mg/L. During TBS,amplitudes of more than 4 mV were measured, indicating theireffect on LTP.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, rosavin, salidroside and various R. rosea extractspotentiated the in vitro electric stimulation of an intra-hippocampal electric circuit, which resulted in higher responsesFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 42580fphar-09-00425 May 22, 2018 Time: 17:35 # 9Dimpfel et al. Quality Control of Rhodiola Extracts by Bioassayof pyramidal cells in isolated hippocampus slices. Rosavin wasmore active in higher concentrations than salidroside; while,salidroside was more effective at lower concentrations. Thehighest content of both active markers was found in the extractsthat were active at the lowest concentrations. Although, thiscorrelation was not applicable to some extracts containingother compounds that presumably reduced the efficacy due toantagonistic interactions. The standardized content of activemarkers is necessary for the quality control of herbal preparationscontaining Rhodiola extracts, but insufficient for assessment oftheir potential efficacy. The application of bioassays should berequired for adequate assessment of the quality and efficacy ofR. rosea extracts.AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND MATERIALThe datasets used and/or analyzed during the current studyare available from the corresponding author upon reasonablerequest.ETHICS STATEMENTThe principles of laboratory animal care were followed in alltrials and the local authority (\u201cRegierungspr\u00e4sidium\u201d Giessen) \u2013responsible for animal care \u2013 was informed according to GermanHealth Guidelines.

Its fruits and seeds as well as other anatomicalcompartments (e.g., flowers and leaves) are rich in numerous bioactive compoundsand therefore, the scientific interest in this plant has been constantly growing in recentyears. It has been shown that pomegranate and its extracts exhibit potent antioxidative,antimicrobial, and anticarcinogenic properties. The present review summarizes somerecent studies on pomegranate, highlighting mainly its vasculoprotective role attributedto the presence of hydrolyzable tannins ellagitannins and ellagic acid, as well as othercompounds (e.g., anthocyanins and flavonoids). These in vitro and in vivo studiesshowed that substances derived from pomegranate reduce oxidative stress and plateletaggregation, diminish lipid uptake by macrophages, positively influence endothelial cellfunction, and are involved in blood pressure regulation. Clinical studies demonstrated thatdaily intake of pomegranate juice lessens hypertension and attenuates atherosclerosis inhumans. Altogether, the reviewed studies point out the potential benefits of a broader useof pomegranate and its constituents as dietary supplements or as adjuvants in therapy ofvascular diseases, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and peripheral arterydisease.Keywords: pomegranate, antioxidant, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, vasculoprotectiveINTRODUCTIONPomegranate (Punica granatum L.), belonging to Punica L. genus, Punicaceae family, is anancient fruit native to Central Asia in regions spanning from Iran and Turkmenistan tonorthern India as well as in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East (Holland et al.,2009). Archaeologists have found carbonized pomegranate exocarps originated from the EarlyBronze Age (3000 BC), e.g., in Jericho and from the Late Bronze Age in Cyprus (Ward,2003; Boncuk, 2014). Pomegranate has been highly appreciated since centuries by differentcultures. For example, in Ancient Egypt it was not only a part of the supply of fruitsfor pharaoh\u2019s residence (at around 1600 B.C.), but pomegranate was also painted on wallsand tombs to symbolize life after death (Ward, 2003; Boncuk, 2014). Pomegranate used to84Wang et al. Vasculoprotective Effects of Pomegranateplay an important role in different religions, includingZoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam(Langley, 2000; Jurenka, 2008). It was praised, e.g., by the OldTestament of the Bible as \u201ca sacred fruit conferring powers offertility, abundance, and good luck\u201d (Jurenka, 2008). Besidesbeing a part of the mythology and consumed as a fruit,pomegranate has been known for its medical use. For example,the Ebers papyrus originating from about 1550 BC noted thatthe roots of the pomegranate tree were used to treat tapewormparasites (Svenja, 2018). In addition, pomegranate was employedto treat diabetes by Indians (Saxena and Vikram, 2004) and tolessen tapeworm infestation also by Romans (Langley, 2000).The persisting significance of the medical use of pomegranatecan be illustrated, for example, by the fact that in Great Britainthe coats of arms of three royal colleague and the British MedicalAssociation are decorated with the figure of this herb (Langley,2000).Besides native regions spreading from Iran to northern Indiaand the Mediterranean area and the Middle East, pomegranate isnowadays cultivated in subtropical Africa as well as in California,Arizona, and Mexico, as this plant requires high exposure tosunlight during summer and temperature not lower than\u223c12\u25e6Cin winter (Levin, 2006; Holland et al., 2009). The pomegranatetree is about 2\u20133m tall, glabrous, with multiple trunks andbushy appearance. The surface of the leaves is smooth andhairless, with a glossy appearance on the upper part of theleaf (Figure 1). The fruit ripens within 5\u20138 months after it hasbegun to form. During this process, the color of the externalpart of the fruit changes from yellow, green, or pink to fullyred, pink, or deep purple (Figure 1). An edible juicy layer ofa fruit varies in color from white to deep red (Holland et al.,2009).Studies accomplished over the last several decades showed thatpomegranate and its components exhibit potent antioxidative(Gil et al., 2000; Les et al., 2015), anti-inflammatory (Adamset al., 2006; Rasheed et al., 2009) as well as antibacterial,antimicrobial, and antifungal properties (Naz et al., 2007; Fawoleet al., 2012; Elsherbiny et al., 2016; Wafa et al., 2017). In additionto these in vitro studies, in vivo and in vitro studies showedthat pomegranate exhibits anti-hypertensive (Mohan et al., 2010;Dos Santos et al., 2016; Arun et al., 2017) and antiproliferativeproperties (Albrecht et al., 2004; Malik et al., 2005; Malik andMukhtar, 2006). Pomegranate and its constituents have beentested for their use as adjuvant therapy for treatment of severalforms of oncological diseases, mainly of prostate cancer (Lanskyand Newman, 2007; Paller et al., 2013; Panth et al., 2017; Sharmaet al., 2017). Furthermore, numerous pre-clinical studies havepointed out the beneficial effects of intake of pomegranatejuice or pomegranate extracts in a variety of conditions. Forexample, such treatment improved sperm quality in mice (T\u00fcrket al., 2008), lowered amyloid deposition in a mouse model ofAlzheimer\u2019s disease (Hartman et al., 2006), and lessened neuronaldamage in a mouse neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injurymodel (Loren et al., 2005). In addition, single intraperitonealinjection with pomegranate extract applied to fishes that had beennaturally infected with lymphocystis disease virus, stimulatedtheir innate immune response, and reduced their mortalitydue to lymphocystis infection (Harikrishnan et al., 2010). Inhumans, oral administration of pomegranate extract enrichedwith ellagic acid is beneficial for minimizing ultraviolet-inducedskin damage (Kasai et al., 2006), while hydro-alcoholic extractsof pomegranate have a significant antibacterial activity and aretherefore useful for treatment of dental plaques (Menezes et al.,2009). Many studies also demonstrated potent vasculoprotectiveeffects of pomegranate and its constituents, as presented below.BIOACTIVE CONSTITUENTS OFPOMEGRANATEBioactive substances of pomegranate include, for example,hydrolyzable tannins (gallotannins and ellagitannins), ellagicacid and its derivatives, gallic acid, anthocyanins/anthocyanidins,proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, vitamins, as well as sterols,lignans, saccharides, fatty acids, organic acids, terpenes, andterpenoids, among others. Ellagitannins and gallotanninstogether with ellagic acid and its derivatives are crucial bioactivecompounds of pomegranate (Amakura et al., 2000a; Gil et al.,2000; Fischer et al., 2011a; Borges and Crozier, 2012; Brighentiet al., 2017). Furthermore, ellagitannins and gallotannins arehydrolyzed to ellagic acid and glucose or gallic acid and glucose,respectively (Arapitsas, 2012). In addition, pomegranate isa source of numerous (poly)phenolic compounds (Fischeret al., 2011a). Anthocyanins present in pomegranate comprisemainly delphinidin 3-glucoside, delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside,pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin3-glucoside, and cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside (Alighourchi et al.,2008; Fischer et al., 2013; Lantzouraki et al., 2015), and thecharacteristic colors of pomegranate fruits are attributed tothem. Pomegranate seeds contain different fatty acids with themost represented punicic acid (Schubert et al., 1999; Kaufmanand Wiesman, 2007; Pande and Akoh, 2009; Verardo et al.,2014; G\u00f3rnas\u00b4 and Rudzinska, 2016). Flavol-3-ols, flavonoidglycosides, phenolic acids, and hydrolyzable tannins representmain phenolic compounds in pomegranate seed residue(He et al., 2011). In pomegranate peel, gallic acid is a majorphenolic constituent while kaempferol-3-O-glucoside is the mostrepresented flavonoid (Ambigaipalan et al., 2016). Triterpenoidsoleanolic acid and ursolic acid are present in pomegranateflower (Fu et al., 2014). Volatile components of pomegranatecomprise monoterpenes, monoterpenoids, aldehydes, alcohols,and linear hydrocarbons monoterpenes, especially representedby alpha-terpinene, alpha-terpineol, and 3-carene (V\u00e1zquez-Ara\u00fajo et al., 2011; Carbonell-Barrachina et al., 2012). Anoverview of compounds identified in pomegranate is outlined inTable 1.VASCULOPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OFVARIOUS PARTS OF POMEGRANATEREVEALED IN IN VITRO AND IN VIVOMODELSMany pomegranate-derived compounds exhibit a wide rangeof vasculoprotective effects.

Vasculoprotective Effects of PomegranateFIGURE 1 | Fruits, flowers, and leaves of Punica granatum L.(components) have proven to reduce oxidative stress, lipidperoxidation, and generation of foam cells, to positivelyinfluence endothelial cell function (by increasing NO levelsand lowering glucose levels), to attenuate platelet aggregationand diminish hypertension, thus altogether improving vascularfunction, as presented below. In addition, pomegranate and itscomponents are protective against toxicity induced by chemicalsor drugs (Table 2 and the text below).Pomegranate Juice and ExtractIn 2000s, Gil et al. in their pivotal study pointed out thestrong antioxidant properties of pomegranate juice enrichedwith tannin punicalagin, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives,as well as other phenolic substances. Using different analyticalmethods, the authors revealed potent antioxidant activities ofpomegranate juice that were three times higher than the well-known antioxidative properties of red wine or green tea (Gil et al.,2000). These findings were confirmed by subsequent studies thatadditionally pointed to vasculoprotective effects of pomegranateproducts, as presented below.In a study involving mice as well as human volunteers,pomegranate juice intake attenuated oxidative stress (Aviramet al., 2000).More specifically, in apolipoprotein E-deficientmice,food supplementation with pomegranate juice reduced by 44%the size of atherosclerotic lesions and diminished the number offoam cells in such lesions (Aviram et al., 2000). In humans, intakeof pomegranate juice diminished the susceptibility of low-densitylipoproteins (LDLs) to aggregate and enhanced by up to 20% theactivity of serum paraoxonase (Aviram et al., 2000), an esterasethat is associated with high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) andcan protect lipids against peroxidation (Chistiakov et al., 2017).Pomegranate juice also inhibited the oxidized LDL (oxLDL)uptake and cholesterol biosynthesis in a J774.A1 macrophage-like cell line (Fuhrman et al., 2005). A study utilizing diabeticmice model suggested that these protective effects might be dueto the presence of unique complex sugars and/or phenolic sugarsin pomegranate juice (Rozenberg et al., 2006). Another studyinvolved high and low exercise lifestylemimicking rats (high- andlow-capacity runners) fed with pomegranate juice for 3 weeks(Rosenblat et al., 2015).While the effects were stronger in a groupof low-capacity runners, the consumption of pomegranate juicedecreased the cellular oxidation and increased the paraoxonase2 activity in peritoneal macrophages from both animal groupswhen compared with non-treated cohorts of animals (Rosenblatet al., 2015).In cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells exposedto high shear stress, pomegranate juice down-regulated theexpression of redox sensitive genes ELK-1 and p-JUN andincreased the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase(eNOS) (De Nigris et al., 2005) that is necessary for the properfunctioning of blood endothelial cells (Vallance and Chan,2001). In addition, an intake of pomegranate juice by LDLreceptor-deficient mice fed with high-cholesterol diet, lessenedprogression of atherogenesis at different stages of the disease (DeNigris et al., 2005). Another in vitro study using cultured bovinepulmonary artery endothelial cells showed that the presence ofeven very low amounts of pomegranate juice in the cultivationmedium protects the generated nitric oxide (NO) against itsoxidative destruction (via an inhibition of a superoxide anion-mediated disappearance of NO, leading to an enhancement ofthe bioavailability of NO) (Ignarro et al., 2006). Another study ofthis group showed that presence of pomegranate juice in humancoronary artery endothelial cells reverts down-regulation of theexpression of eNOS caused by the addition of oxLDL (de Nigriset al., 2006). In a study accomplished in hypercholesterolemicmice, an intake of pomegranate juice enriched with punicalaginincreased the eNOS expression and decelerated the progressionof atherosclerosis, as well as enhanced nitrates levels (De Nigriset al., 2007). In pigs, an intake of the commercial pomegranateextract Pomanox R\u00a9 made from dried pomegranate skin orhusk could reduce coronary endothelial dysfunction induced byhyperlipidemia (Vilahur et al., 2015). These beneficial effectsincluded an activation of the protein kinase B (Akt)/eNOSpathway and an attenuation of vascular inflammation as well as ofvascular damage induced by oxidative stress (Vilahur et al., 2015).Furthermore, pomegranate juice attenuated the aggregationof human platelets exposed to collagen or arachidonic acidex vivo (Aviram et al., 2000; Mattiello et al., 2009), byattenuating calcium mobilization, thromboxane A2 production,and hydrogen peroxide formation (Mattiello et al., 2009).These effects were assigned to the presence of polyphenolsin pomegranate products (Mattiello et al., 2009). It was alsoshown that pomegranate fruit extract was active at a 2.0\u00b5Mconcentration that is possible to be achieved after polyphenol-rich food intake by humans (Mattiello et al., 2009). On theother side, pomegranate seed oil inhibited cyclooxygenase (COX)Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 54486Wang et al.

The latter substance is known as a potent vasoprotectivefactor inhibiting platelet adhesion and thrombus formation onendothelium (Weiss and Turitto, 1979). In addition, feeding ofrats with pomegranate extract diminished in colonic mucosalevels of COX-2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as well as induciblenitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Larrosa et al., 2010b).Some other works investigated how pomegranate affectsarterial hypertension, an important risk factor for cardiovasculardiseases (Pickering, 1972). For example, in a study involvedthe use of Wistar rats in which diabetes was induced bystreptozotocin administration, and the animals were additionallychallenged by a subcutaneous administration of angiotensin II toinduce hypertension, a prolonged administration of pomegranatejuice (for 4 weeks) reduced activity of angiotensin convertingenzyme (ACE), as well as decreased mean arterial blood pressurein comparison with non-treated animals (Mohan et al., 2010).Pomegranate fruit extracts were also studied regarding theirprotective effect against cardiac toxicity induced by drugs orsmoking. For example, detrimental effects of a cardiotoxic drugisoproterenol (known to cause a cardiac necrosis leading toa myocardial infarction) were reduced upon pre-treatment ofrats with pomegranate juice for 30 consecutive days beforeisoproterenol treatment (Jadeja et al., 2010). Such pre-treatmentsignificantly lessened an increase in the heart weight, infarctionsize, plasma marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation levels as wellas levels of Ca2+ ATPase (Jadeja et al., 2010). The protectiveeffects of pomegranate juice intake were also demonstratedin a study using rats in which a cardiac hypertrophywas induced by cigarette smoke exposure (Al Hariri et al.,2016).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 54490Wang et al. Vasculoprotective Effects of PomegranatePomegranate Seed OilPomegranate seeds comprise about 3% of the pomegranateweight and contain about 12\u201320% seed oil (Lansky and Newman,2007) that is rich in fatty acids and contains mainly punicic acid(Kaufman and Wiesman, 2007; Verardo et al., 2014; G\u00f3rnas\u00b4 andRudzinska, 2016).In rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, oral feedingwith seed extracts significantly reduced blood glucose levels(Das et al., 2001). In mice, an intake of pomegranate seedoil counteracted their obesity induced by a high-fat diet byenhancing peripheral insulin sensitivity (Vroegrijk et al., 2011).Oral treatment of the above cited diabetic rats with pomegranateseed oil significantly decreased peroxidation of plasma lipids(Mollazadeh et al., 2016). In addition, such treatment diminishedmalondialdehyde content in homogenates from the heart andkidney tissues, and reduced triglyceride levels in treated animalsin comparison to the control cohort (Mollazadeh et al.,2016).Pomegranate Flower, Peel, and LeafExtractsA 6-week oral administration of pomegranate flower extractssuppressed plasma glucose levels in Zucker diabetic fattyrats following their exposure to glucose-loading. In addition,such treatment in these animals increased cardiac peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) mRNAexpression as well as restored the down-regulated cardiac glucosetransporter (GLUT)-4 mRNA, altogether improving insulinsensitivity (Huang et al., 2005a). These beneficial effects wereassigned mainly to the presence of gallic acid (Huang et al.,2005a). A long-term treatment of Zucker diabetic fatty rats withpomegranate flower extracts was cardioprotective, as it loweredtheir fatty acid-, triglycerides-, and total cholesterol plasma levelsas well as reduced the cardiac triglycerides content (Huang et al.,2005b). In another study, oral administration of pomegranateflower extracts decreased plasma glucose levels in non-fasteddiabetic rats (but not in fasted-diabetic rats or in normal rats).This study also showed that pomegranate flower extracts inhibit\u03b1-glucosidase (a key enzyme for carbohydrate digestion inintestines) and administration of pomegranate flower extractsmay improve postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, andaltogether diminish the risk of cardiovascular dysfunctions (Liet al., 2005). In mice fed with a high-fat diet to induce obesity,treatment with pomegranate leaf extract decreased body weight,energy intake as well as total cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucoselevels (Lei et al., 2007). Administration of hydroalcoholic peel orleaf extracts of pomegranate for 28 days decreased blood glucoselevels in aWister rat model of diabetes induced by streptozotocin(Salwe et al., 2015). Hydroalcoholic peel extracts of pomegranatewere also tested in spontaneously hypertensive ovariectomizedfemale rats (an animal model for menopause characterized byan increase in the superoxide anion levels; Delgado et al., 2016).Such treatment diminished elevation of superoxide anion levelsand lessened oxidative stress in this animal model (Delgado et al.,2016). Treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats of differentages for 30 days with pomegranate peel extracts, significantlyreduced systolic blood pressure, ACE activity, oxidative stressas well as vascular remodeling (Dos Santos et al., 2016). Arecent in vitro study showed that pomegranate peel methanolicextracts potently scavenge superoxide and hydroxyl radicals,protect LDL against oxidation and suppress ACE activity (Arunet al., 2017). Altogether, these studies demonstrated that alsothe non-edible parts of pomegranate\u2014peel and leaves\u2014exhibitvasculoprotective effects.VASCULOPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OFPURE COMPOUNDS DERIVED FROMPOMEGRANATEStudies presented above showed the numerous vasculoprotectiveeffects of different parts of the pomegranate. It was suggestedthat many of these protective effects are caused by the presenceof hydrolyzable tannins (ellagitannins and gallotannins), theirderivative ellagic acid, or their common metabolites urolithins(Table 3 and the text below).Pomegranate ellagitannins and a single high molecularweight ellagitannin punicalagin, attenuated the inflammatory cellsignaling in colon cancer cells (Adams et al., 2006). Punicalaginand gallic acid induced in isolated macrophages the expression ofparaoxonase 2 (Shiner et al., 2007). These substances also reducedoxidative stress in macrophages via activation of transcriptionfactors PPAR-\u03b3 and activator protein 1 (AP-1; Shiner et al.,2007).Single components (e.g., punicalin, punicalagin, ellagic acid,and gallic acid) isolated from pomegranate fruit suppressedthe formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs,known to contribute to a number of diseases includingdiabetic complications and arteriosclerosis) from bovineserum albumin and sugar in antiglycation assays in vitro(Kumagai et al., 2015). Pomegranate fruit extracts alsoreduced the accumulation of AGEs in mice fed with ahigh-fat and high-sucrose diet (Kumagai et al., 2015).In addition, punicalagin and ellagic acid inhibited lipidmetabolism in mouse and human adipocytes ex vivo (Les et al.,2017).Effects of ellagic acid on reactive oxygen species (ROS)generation were also investigated in endothelial cells. Pre-treatment of HUVECs with ellagic acid attenuated ROSproduction and prevented eNOS downregulation inducedby oxLDL (Lee et al., 2010; Ou et al., 2010). Ex vivo,ellagic acid stimulated vasorelaxation of the rat thoracicaorta via an endothelium-dependent mechanism and aninhibition of calcium influx (Yilmaz and Usta, 2013).Nevertheless, as ellagitannins and ellagic acid in vivometabolize into urolithins that enter systemic circulation(Cerd\u00e1et al., 2005; Larrosa et al., 2010a), researchersalso studied how these metabolites affect the vascularfunction.The antioxidant properties of different urolithins wereevaluated in a cell-based assay and the results showed thaturolithin C and D were more potent antioxidants than theparental substance ellagic acid and punicalagin (Bialonska et al.,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 54491Wang et al.

Nonetheless, although an in vitro antioxidant potentialof urolithin A was relatively low in comparison with otherurolithins, its plasma concentrations was the highest amongthem (Bialonska et al., 2009). In a subsequent study, urolithinA glucuronide inhibited adhesion of monocytes to endothelialcells in the micromolar range (5\u201315\u00b5M), suggesting that thebeneficial effects of pomegranate intake on the vasculaturemight be partly mediated by urolithin A glucuronide (Gimenez-Bastida et al., 2012). In addition, a recent in vitro study showedpotent anti-atherogenic properties of ellagic acid and someurolithins (Mele et al., 2016). All these compounds reducedthe adhesion of THP-1 derived macrophages to HUVECsand diminished secretion of soluble vascular cell adhesionmolecule-1 (VCAM-1) and inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6)(Mele et al., 2016). In a study utilizing cultured human arteryendothelial cells, urolithin A attenuated endothelial dysfunctioninduced by oxLDL (Han et al., 2016). These effects werepartly mediated by counteracting eNOS-dependent decreasein NO production (Han et al., 2016). In addition, urolithinA reduced the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), upon adhesion of THP-1 cells to the endothelial cells.Urolithin A also suppressed the expression of tumor necrosisfactor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6 and endothelin-1, increased PPAR-\u03b3 mRNA expression, and downregulated phosphorylation ofthe extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)(Han et al., 2016). In another study, urolithin A inhibitedheme peroxidases [myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoperoxidase(LPO)] more effectively than its parent compound ellagic acid(Saha et al., 2016). Animal experiments using C57BL/6 micerevealed potent anti-inflammatory properties of urolithin A,as it efficiently reduced phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced mouse ear edema formation (Saha et al., 2016).Urolithin A also lessened myocardial ischemia/reperfusioninjury and reduced myocardial infarct size in mice via thephosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway (Tang et al.,2017).Altogether, the studies presented above pointed to beneficialvascular effects of urolithins and especially metabolite urolithinA. Additional information on metabolic fate and healtheffects of ellagitanins and urolithins can be found in severalrecent reviews (Garcia-Mu\u00f1oz and Vaillant, 2014; Lipinskaet al., 2014; Landete et al., 2016; Tomas-Barberan et al.,2017).In addition to the above presented effects of hydrolyzabletannins (ellagitannins and gallotannins), their derivativeellagic acid, or their common metabolites urolithins, butalso other substances were shown to contribute to beneficialeffects of pomegranate products. These include (poly)phenoliccompounds anthocyanins (Alighourchi et al., 2008; Fischeret al., 2011a) and flavonoids (Sudheesh and Vijayalakshmi,2005; Ricci et al., 2006), as well as fatty acids (Kaufman andWiesman, 2007). For example, anthocyanins exhibit anti-inflammatory activities (Vendrame and Klimis-Zacas, 2015).Flavonoid naringin abundantly present in pomegranate juice(Mphahlele et al., 2014) is considered to contribute (togetherFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 54492Wang et al. Vasculoprotective Effects of Pomegranatewith flavonoid naritutin) to the anti-hypertensive effects ofsweetie juice in humans (Reshef et al., 2005). Puninic acidwas shown to ameliorate glucose tolerance and diminishobesity-related inflammation via an activation of PPAR-\u03b3and \u03b1 (Hontecillas et al., 2009). Quercetin present in juice,seed, and peel of pomegranate (Artik, 1998; Borges andCrozier, 2012; Ambigaipalan et al., 2016) is known to mediateendothelium-dependent vasodilatation via stimulation of boththe NO/cyclic guanylyl monophosphate (cGMP) pathway andendothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) (Khooet al., 2010).CLINICAL STUDIES ON POMEGRANATE INTHE CONTEXT OF CARDIOVASCULARDISEASESMany clinical studies investigating the effects of pomegranate inthe context of CVDs were performed in the last two decades.These works profusely demonstrated the vasculoprotectiveproperties of pomegranate products (Table 4). Nevertheless,some of these studies pointed to the fact that when applyingpomegranate for a longer period or in high amounts, certainpossible side effects of such treatment (mainly diarrhea) mightoccur (Paller et al., 2013).In hypertensive patients, daily consumption of pomegranatejuice for 2 weeks reduced the activity of ACE by 36% aswell as diminished systolic blood pressure by 5% (Aviramand Dornfeld, 2001). The same group also reported that along-duration intake of pomegranate juice (for 3 years) bypatients with carotid artery stenosis significantly reduced theirblood pressure, LDL oxidation and common carotid intima-media thickness (Aviram et al., 2004). A 4-week consumptionof pomegranate juice reduced significantly blood pressurein a cohort of 51 healthy women (without significantlychanging serum ACE activity; Lynn et al., 2012). Anotherstudy involving 13 hypersensitive men demonstrated that intakeof pomegranate juice lowered blood pressure (Asgary et al.,2013). However, in these patients the levels of some clinicalparameters, such as serum concentrations of C-reactive protein(CRP), E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-6 remainedunchanged (Asgary et al., 2013). A subsequent study involving 21hypertensive patients showed that consumption of pomegranatejuice significantly reduced systolic as well as diastolic bloodpressure (Asgary et al., 2014). In addition, a double blind,randomized, placebo controlled pilot study revealed that thepomegranate peel hydroalcoholic extract reduced cardiovascularrisk factors in obese women with dyslipidemia (Haghighian et al.,2016).Although a meta-analysis evaluating the effects ofpomegranate consumption on CRP concentrations did notreveal a significant correlation between these parameters(Sahebkar et al., 2016), the effects of pomegranate consumptionon blood pressure regulation in accomplished animal andhuman studies seem to be clinically relevant. In a recent reviewit was concluded that both pomegranate juice and seed oilcan effectively lower blood pressure (Asgary et al., 2017).Another recently accomplished meta-analysis came to thesame conclusions, as intake of pomegranate juice decreasedlevels of systolic blood pressure regardless of the durationand dose of the juice consumed in the evaluated studies,whereas doses more than 240 cc (eight ounces) exhibited aborderline significant effect in reducing of a diastolic bloodpressure (Sahebkar et al., 2017). The authors of this meta-analysis determined a constant benefit of pomegranate juiceintake on blood pressure, which may be considered clinicallyrelevant.

Vasculoprotective Effects of Pomegranatevasculature can be found in some other reviews (Lansky andNewman, 2007; Aviram and Rosenblat, 2013; Hyson, 2015;Zheng et al., 2017). In addition to many described beneficialeffects of pomegranete on endothelial function, pomegranatejuice was also found to enhance the inhibitory effect of NOon vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (Ignarro et al.,2006). This aspect might be clinically relevant and a subjectof further studies, as vascular smooth muscle cell proliferationplays an important role in the development and progression ofatherosclerosis and restenosis (Uhrin et al., 2018; Wang et al.,2018).CONCLUSIONPomegranate, an ancient and highly distinctive fruit, isa rich source of natural bioactive constituents. Variousstudies showed that pomegranate and its products exhibitprotective effects on the cardiovascular system. Thesevasculoprotective effects include diminishing of oxidativestress, positive influencing macrophage-, endothelial cell-,and platelet function, lowering lipid oxidation, reducingblood glucose levels, vasodilatory effects as well as decreasingblood pressure via an inhibition of ACE activity. In lightof the altogether promising outcome of numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies, pomegranate is advocatedto be used as a dietary supplement for prevention andtreatment of cardiovascular diseases, thus representing asupplementary non-pharmacological therapy for cardiovasculardiseases.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDW, C\u00d6, IA-R, SC, JP, PU, and AA wrote the first draft of themanuscript.

Pharmacol. 9:409.doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00409An Ethnobotanical Study ofMedicinal Plants in the Greek Islandsof North Aegean RegionEvangelos Axiotis, Maria Halabalaki* and Leandros A. SkaltsounisDepartment of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian Universityof Athens, Athens, GreeceGreek islands of the North Aegean Region are a group of nine inhabited islands (Lemnos,Agios Efstratios, Lesvos, Chios, Psara, Oinousses, Samos, Ikaria, and Fourni) located inthe northern part of the Aegean Sea, close to Asia Minor. Each island of this regioncan be considered autonomous in terms of culture and biodiversity. With this workwe try to evaluate the status of the traditional uses of medicinal plants in this region.Endemic and endangered species such as Sideritis sipylea Boiss., Origanum sipyleumL., Thymus sipyleus Boiss., Pistacia lentiscus L., Verbascum ikaricum Murb., are stillused by locals to treat different ailments. Moreover, the use of some species for thetreatment of specific diseases has been reported for the first time. We report about 109wild plants of medicinal importance, from 52 families, listing their uses for therapeuticpurposes and galenic preparations provided by local medical doctors and pharmacists.The information we include was derived from literature sources and additionally collectedthrough semi-structured interviews conducted on 200 informants (100 men and 100women). Additionally, informant consensus factor (FIC) and UV value were calculatedfor the medicinal plants in the current study in relation with the diseases treated. Thisresearch confirms the importance of the medicinal plants and the diffusion of theiruse in traditional medicine within this region. This ethnopharmacological survey is afundamental step for the preservation of the local knowledge both for further scientificresearch and for the protection of endangered and endemic medicinal plants.Keywords: ethnopharmacology, traditional medicine, Near East Greek islands, North Aegean Sea, ethnobotanyINTRODUCTIONGreece holds a unique position with respect to the number of plant species and subspeciescompared to other areas of the globe. This depends on the variety of habitats, as well as ongeological history, climate conditions, and geographical position within the Mediterranean. Thus,it is noted for its high plant species diversity (5800 species and 1893 subspecies) and endemism(22.2% of all species present with 1278 species and 452 subspecies) (Davis, 1965\u20131986; Tutin et al.,1968\u20131980; Strid, 1986; Strid and Tan, 1991, 1997, 2002; Georgiou and Delipetrou, 2010).The Northeast Aegean islands offer a unique ecosystem with significant \u201chotspots\u201d for variousplant diversification responses and endemism. This depends on the fact that Aegean Sea isan archipelago of continental islands placed on the conjunction of Europe, Asia, and Africa(Gogou et al., 2016). The available \u201cecological space\u201d with \u201cenvironmental heterogeneity\u201d inaddition with the \u201cland-bridge system\u201d with the continents determined a high floristic diversityFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 40999fphar-09-00409 May 19, 2018 Time: 14:41 # 2Axiotis et al. Ethnobotanical Study of North Aegeanand endemism (Kallimanis et al., 2011). Several botanical studieshave been conducted on these islands (Christodoulakis, 1986,1996; Panitsa et al., 1994, 2006; Panitsa and Tzanoudakis,1998, 2001; Snogerup et al., 2001; Bazos, 2005). However,there is limited information regarding the medicinal plants andtraditional plant remedies in this area.Nowadays the use of plants and traditional medicine playsan important role for the discovery of new pharmacologicalagents. Ethnopharmacology represents a multidimensionalapproach, shaped by tradition and science that can improveour knowledge of plant use and local meaning of health anddisease (World Health Organization [WHO], 2002). The aimof this study is threefold: to present a complete list of themedicinal plants used in traditional medicine in the islandsof Northeast Aegean Sea, preserve information about theiruse and, lastly, highlight the use in traditional medicine ofendemic and endangered plant species, in order to prevent theirextinction.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy AreaThe current study was conducted on the islands and isletsof the northeast edge of the Aegean Sea and is dominatedby the islands of Lemnos, Agios Efstratios, Lesvos, Chios,Psara, Oinousses, Samos, Ikaria, and Fournoi (Figure 1). Thegeographical coordinates of the islands are represented inSupplementary Table 4. The region covers an area of 3835 km2and has approximately 2500 vascular plant species.The terrain of the islands is 33% mountainous, 35% hilly,and 32% flat. The surface area and the maximum elevationranged from 40 km2 for Psara and Fourni to 1633 km2for Lesvos and from 0 to 1433 m of height (Kerketea mt,Samos), respectively (Higgins and Higgins, 1996). The islandscan be grouped in two phytogeographical zones among the13 existing in Greece (Supplementary Figure 1); the zone ofthe Northern Aegean (NAe) with Lemnos and Agios Efstratiosand the zone of the Eastern Aegean (EAe) with Lesvos, Psara,Chios, Oinousses, Samos, Ikaria and Fournoi, with specificclimatic differences (Rauh, 1949). The palaeography and thegeological events that separated these islands from Anatolianmainland, certain environmental parameters (temperature andhumidity) and habitat diversity in well-defined fragmented areas,are among the causes of the high endemism, floral richnessand diversification in quantity and quality of many secondarymetabolites that characterize the pharmacological properties ofmany species of the study area (Panitsa et al., 2010).MethodologyThe information summarized in the present paper was compiledfrom 15 randomly selected villages from the islands of thesurveyed area (Figure 1). The methodology followed in thefield surveys is based on Fujita et al. (1995). The data wascollected through semi-structured interviews performed withlocal people (Martin, 1995). After explaining the purpose ofour research, a questionnaire in Greek was administered tothe informants including questions about their age, education,and interest in traditional medicine. A total of 200 peoplewas surveyed, 100 women and 100 men, with an average ageof 40. The informants with knowledge about medicinal plantswere questioned multiple times, and, during the interviews,local names of the plants, utilized parts, preparation methodsand traditional cultivation techniques were recorded. Themajority of these skillful informants were medical doctors,pharmacists, and farmers. All the results are summarized inSupplementary Table 1. The data acquired for each plant includesfamily, botanical name, local name in Greek, locality, vouchernumber, parts used and their preparation, therapeutic effect andailments treated. The plant families were listed in alphabeticalorder.Field trips were conducted with the interviewees to collectspecimens of the plants (with the exception of the endangeredones). A photographic archive of the observed species was createdto help the identification. The specimens were collected andherborized by the department\u2019s herbarium with a specific vouchernumber. Furthermore, we examined the therapeutic effect andpreparations of each plant based on the informants\u2019 feedback andon literature records.For the analysis of the use of the medicinal plants againstspecific diseases, we used informant consensus factor (FIC),summarized in Supplementary Table 3 (Trotter and Logan,1986; Heinrich, 2000). Moreover, the Use Value (UV) wascalculated to demonstrate the relative importance of the speciesknown locally, summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The plantspecies scientific names were verified according to the Plant Listand to the International Plant Name Index. Information thatwas not possible to confirm was not recorded. Moreover, inSupplementary Table 1, we reported some of the most importantbibliographic references for plant species and ailments treatedthat were not mentioned by the informants (Snogerup andSnogerup, 1987, 1993; Panitsa et al., 1994, 2006, 2010; Snogerupet al., 2001; Bergmeier et al., 2003; Bazos, 2005; Bourbonnais-Spear et al., 2006; Saliaris, 2008; Axiotis and Axiotis, 2012; Strid,2016).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn the context of the current survey numerous medicinal plantswere ethnopharmacologicaly investigated (in SupplementaryTable 1). The interviews indicated that 109 wild plant speciesfrom 52 different families are being used for medicinal purposes.Lamiaceae family is represented by the highest number of species(17), such as the endemic and endangered Sideritis sipylea Boiss.Asteraceae family is represented by 12 species. Brassicaceae andRosaceae by 5 species. The rest of the plant families are shownin Supplementary Figure 2. Most of the plant parts were used totreat different diseases and they were mostly stored in glass bottlesas homemade dry powders obtained by crushing down well-driedplant materials; the most frequently used parts are leaves (22,8%),roots (12,78%), flowers (11,41%), essential oils (7,30%), fruits(6,84%), and barks (5%). The most common preparation is thedecoction.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 409100fphar-09-00409 May 19, 2018 Time: 14:41 # 3Axiotis et al. Ethnobotanical Study of North AegeanFIGURE 1 | Geographical location of the study area (Islands in red). Collection sites of the information are as follows. (1) Lemnos, (2) Agios Efstratios, (3) Lesvos,(4) Chios, (5) Psara, (6) Oinousses, (7) Samos, (8) Ikaria, (9) Fourni (http://www.pvaigaiou.gov.gr).Interestingly, Hypericum perforatum L. and Verbascumikaricum Murb. are kept in olive oil and used as solutions forwounds and sun burns. Pharmacists from Lesvos, Chios andSamos, still use these preparations as traditional therapy forskin wound healing in combination with modern treatments.Furthermore, clinicians from Lesvos use the powder of theroot of Alkanna tinctoria for skin regeneration after injuries.They observed a combined antibacterial and antipruritic action,which reduces the healing time of the wound. It is important tonote that Sideritis sipylea Boiss., Origanum sipyleum L., Thymussipyleus Boiss., which are endemic and endangered plants aremostly used by the local people of Lesvos, Chios, and Ikariawith many curative purposes, especially for the infections of therespiratory and gastrointestinal tract as indicated from the UVvalues (Supplementary Table 1).Furthermore, the resin of Pistacia lentiscus L., unique productglobally of the Chios island is widely used against diarrhea, asexpectorant and for ulcer healing. The use of the water extractof the roots of Anthyllis hermanniae L. as an efficient naturalremedy against kidney stones in Lesvos and Lemnos, is reportedhere for the first time. It was also observed that local people,especially farmers, use the same name for different plant species.For example, Cistus creticus L. and Cistus salvifolius L. are bothcalled \u201cAks\u00ecstaros\u201d; Origanum vulgare L. and the endemic andendangered Origanum sipyleum L. are both called \u201cR\u00ecgani.\u201d Thislack of distinction by the local population exacerbates the risksfor the endangered species.Very interesting is the distribution of ailments treatedversus plant species used. As it is presented in Figure 2,locals are choosing herbal remedies mainly for antimicrobialactivity, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory, inflammatory,cardiovascular diseases, and skin burns. In SupplementaryTable 3, FIC values of categories of ailments are summarized.Hormonal diseases have the highest FIC value (0,722), while thelowest belongs to the cardiovascular diseases (0,161). Moreover,among the species recorded (Supplementary Table 1), the highestUV were calculated for Matricaria chamomilla L. (0.75) andLavandula stoechas L. (0.64). From the endemic species thehighest UV is recorded for Sideritis sipylea Boiss. (0.31).Essential oils are also common in the region, mainly derivedfrom aromatic plants of Lamiaceae family and they are producedby water or steam distillation. The oils are usually used as dropsdirectly on the skin or in galenic formulations, for skin infectionsor burns. In some cases, they are used for stomach pain (Anthemissp.) or even for urinary infections (Sideritis sipylea Boiss.). Themost common plants used for producing essential oils are SalviaFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 409101fphar-09-00409 May 19, 2018 Time: 14:41 # 4Axiotis et al.

Furthermore, it has beenreported a traditional method for the production of rose oil of theflower petals of Rosa damascena Mill. in a small village of Lesvos.The oil is used for external burns or skin inflammations.The pharmacological properties of medicinal plants presentedin the current study has been also verified by published data, inseveral cases. For example, the essential oil of Laurus nobilis L.,used as anti-inflammatory is reported by Sayyah et al. (2003).The expectorant effect of Cistus creticus L. and the use of Menthaspicata L. in cases of common cold have been reported by Fakiret al. (2009). Tonic effects of Rosmarinus officinalis L. and thediuretic effects of Raphanus raphanistrum L. have been reportedby Bruni et al. (1997). The essential oil of Sideritis species presentsan important antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity and ithas been previously reported by Aligiannis et al. (2001).Generally, these plants are distributed mainly in Lesvos, Chios,Samos, and Ikaria and the majority are wild. A serious threat forsome of these plants, is that they are collected in large amountsfor the local markets; some of them, such as Sideritis sipyleaBoiss., Origanum sipyleum L., Thymus sipyleus Boiss., are in factlisted in the book of the Red List of Threatened Species. Manyspecies, such as Origanum vulgare L. and Paeonia mascula (L.)Mill. subsp. mascula are not yet listed but their population is in acritical condition. Endemic medicinal plants of the research areaare also annotated in Supplementary Table 2.A very important issue is the increased use of medicinalplants in these islands which has led to heavy pressure on thenative populations of many species. The local population mustacknowledge their endangerment and should cultivate them,in order to protect their populations from extinction. Sideritissipylea Boiss. is one of the over harvested species. Habitat loss anddeforestation in Lesvos, Chios, and Samos resulted in a generaldegradation of the ecosystems that could lead to the extinction ofmany species.In conclusion, from this brief report is clear that medicinalplants are an important element of indigenous medical systemof Northeast Aegean islands. In spite of the fact that thelocal population has access to modern medicines, many peoplecontinue to depend, at least for the treatment of some diseases,on herbal remedies. These therapies represent for many localdoctors a low-cost alternative. The population of many endemicspecies such as Sideritis sipylea Boiss., Origanum sipyleum L., arein a critical condition due to unsustainable harvesting techniques,habitat destruction, and absence of cultivation. The endemicspecies of the area have medicinal properties dependent on themetabolites which respond to environmental stimuli that maybe absent under culture conditions. Because of this it is veryimportant to educate local people about respecting their naturalhabitats and strengthen the legislation against the illegal trade ofendemic and endangered plants in the local and national market.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSEA contributed to the study conception and design of themethodology.

Thepresent work provides an up to date overview of mechanisms linking lycopene in thehuman diet and vascular changes, considering epidemiological data, clinical studies,and experimental data. Lycopene may improve vascular function and contributes to theprimary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disorders. The main activity profileof lycopene includes antiatherosclerotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive,antiplatelet, anti-apoptotic, and protective endothelial effects, the ability to improve themetabolic profile, and reduce arterial stiffness. In this context, lycopene has been shownin numerous studies to exert a favorable effect in patients with subclinical atherosclerosis,metabolic syndrome, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, stroke and several othercardiovascular disorders, although the obtained results are sometimes inconsistent,which warrants further studies focusing on its bioactivity.Keywords: lycopene, arterial stiffness, endothelial function, intima-media thickness, cardiovascular riskINTRODUCTIONCardiovascular disorders (CVD) are the leading mortality cause worldwide and prophylacticmeasures to combat it deserve special attention. Atherosclerosis is, in most cases, the mainmanifestation of CVD, and its progression may be clinical silent for a long time, up to a certainmoment, when it directly leads into a severe adverse event (e.g., heart attack or stroke). Beneficiallifestyle changes are important and most cost-effective components of prevention or treatmentof cardiovascular disorders. Compounds occurring in plants often display diverse bioactivitieswith therapeutic potential and different plants and plant-derived compounds have a long historyof being reported to exhibit effects counteracting CVD (Atanasov et al., 2015; Waltenbergeret al., 2016). Among lifestyle factors, a healthy diet is considered a cornerstone of cardiovasculardisease prevention, and the inclusion of sufficient fruits and vegetables in the diet is regarded asespecially important (B\u00f6hm, 2012; Piepoli et al., 2016). The prevalence of cardiovascular disordersis remarkably unevenly distributed in developed countries, and some areas, e.g., Southern Europe,seem to be protected by having significantly less prevalence of the disease. This effect has oftenbeen attributed to dietary factors, as e.g., the Mediterranean diet, with a lot of vegetables, includingtomatoes, tomato products, and olive oil (M\u00fcller-Nordhorn et al., 2008; Krasinska et al., 2017).Tomatoes, tomato sauce, and watermelon are important sources of lycopene andmay be a surrogate105Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular Healthfor the Mediterranean diet to some degree (Sesso et al., 2003;Burton-Freeman and Sesso, 2014; Naz et al., 2014).Dietary lycopene is considered to confer cardiovascularbenefits, as e.g., consuming at least 7 servings/week oflycopene-based products significantly decreased cardiovascularrisk within seven years in postmenopausal women, free fromprior cardiovascular disorders and cancer (Sesso et al., 2003).A negative correlation between serum lycopene concentrationand cardiovascular mortality was also found in a follow-up studywith a large Japanese cohort (Ito et al., 2006). Many studiesabout the relationship between lycopene and cardiovascularrisk have been conducted and, although, some of the resultsare inconsistent, overall dietary lycopene intake and high-serum concentration of lycopene, significantly reduced therisk of major cardiovascular events (Cheng et al., 2017; Songet al., 2017). Not all outcomes were positive, as exemplifiedin the Physicians Health Study, including 499 patients withcardiovascular disorders, not revealing any association of higherplasma lycopene and CVD (M\u00fcller et al., 2016). Within theKuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD), norelationship was reported between low serum lycopene and anincreased CVDmortality and sudden cardiac death, respectively,in Finnish, middle-aged men (Karppi et al., 2012; M\u00fcller et al.,2016).Vascular health depends on endothelial function, arterialstiffness, and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques. Thefollowing section will discuss the different methods to measurevascular health. Endothelial dysfunction enables developmentof the atherosclerotic plaque. The flow mediated dilatation ofthe brachial artery was traditionally used to assess endothelialfunction for a long period, but forearm plethysmographyand reactive hyperemia\u2014peripheral arterial tonometry havebecome the gold standards for assessing endothelial vascularfunction (Kim et al., 2011; Gajendragadkar et al., 2014). Whilehyperemia\u2014peripheral arterial tonometry is less operator-dependent and non-invasive, while being as reliable as thetraditional method, forearm plethysmography additionallyprovides mechanistic information related to nitric oxidesynthesis, is a marker for cardiovascular risk, and can improverisk prediction (Kim et al., 2011; Gajendragadkar et al., 2014).An increased arterial stiffness is one of the first structuraland functional changes of the vessel wall and is mainly causedby arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis and vessel wall calcification(Cavalcante et al., 2011). Arterial stiffness is associated withcardiovascular risk and predicts cardiovascular disorders andmortality (Vlachopoulos et al., 2010; Mozos et al., 2017c). Pulsewave velocity (PWV) and augmentation indices are simple,noninvasive, inexpensive and validated methods used to assessarterial stiffness and as screening methods for the detection ofpre-clinical cardiovascular disorders (Vlachopoulos et al., 2010;Mozos et al., 2017a).Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) assessed non-invasivelyby B-mode ultrasonography, is a simple, validated and safemethod used to measure the extent of subclinical atherosclerosis(Dwyer et al., 2004; Wood and Johnson, 2004; Hosseini et al.,2017; Kim and Youn, 2017). IMT is defined by the measurementof the dimension of the intima and media of the arterial wall,whereas a value >0.9mm is considered abnormal (Cooneyet al., 2015; Piepoli et al., 2016). Although IMT has beenconsidered as a surrogate measure of cardiovascular risk,predicting cardiovascular events, especiallymyocardial infarctionand stroke (O\u2019Leary et al., 1999; Touboul, 2015; Piepoli et al.,2016; Hosseini et al., 2017; Pleskovic et al., 2017), both theAmerican and the European guidelines on cardiovascular diseaseprevention do not recommend the systematic measurement ofIMT to improve risk assessment (Goff et al., 2014; Piepoli et al.,2016). Major concerns of IMT include lack of standardization, itshigh variability and low intra-individual reproducibility (Piepoliet al., 2016). Additionally, a trained sonographer is requiredto limit variability of the results due to the patient or medicalequipment (Touboul, 2015). There are also methods availablethat can better predict cardiovascular events than IMT, mostprominently MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) that can be usedto monitor atherosclerotic plaques. Several methods are strongerpredictor of myocardial infarction than IMT, such as monitoringatherosclerotic plaques and exploring the carotid wall by MRI(because the adventitia is also included in the measurement ofthe wall thickness; Zhang et al., 2014). However, the resourcesneeded to access wall thickness by MRI are manifold higherthan using ultrasonography, but especially for patients withabnormal findings in IMT screenings, a subsequent MRI scanmight be useful to provide a more accurate description of theatherosclerotic plaque and the risk of major cardiovascular events(Zhang et al., 2014).Despite the inevitable influence of aging, vascular changes areat least partially reversible, and dietary changes may improvevascular function. Lycopene has several advantages, such asalmost no adverse reactions, its wide availability and lowcost (Gao et al., 2016). The present review aims to give acurrent overview of the mechanisms linking lycopene in thehuman diet and vascular changes, considering epidemiologicaldata, clinical observational, retrospective, intervention andrandomized studies, dietary and biomarker studies, in vitro andin vivo research and discussing preventive benefits of lycopeneintake in context of cardiovascular disease prevention.LYCOPENELycopene is a lipophilic, biologically active, unsaturated, acycliccarotenoid, with the chemical formula C40H56 (Figure 1). Inplants it is considered as an important intermediate of carotenoidsynthesis, but in human nutrition lycopene plays no role asprovitamin A precursor due to the absence of appropriateenzymes. Plant lycopene is usually present as all-trans isomer.Isomerization of the all-trans isomer into the more bioavailablecis-isomer, occurs under acidic conditions (e.g., gastric acid),due to exposure to light and thermal energy. Lycopene canbe found in tomatoes, watermelon, papaya, red grapefruits,apricots, and guava, and gives their red color (Kong et al., 2010;Gajendragadkar et al., 2014; Mozos et al., 2017c). Lycopenecontent increases during different stages of ripening of fruits,e.g., for tomatoes there is a steady increase in lycopene contentfrom the breaker to the red stage (Saini et al., 2017). WatermelonFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521106Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular Healthpulp can also be used for lycopene extraction (Oberoi andSoqi, 2017) and is a rich source of cis-isomeric lycopene,abundant in higher concentrations than in tomatoes (Naz et al.,2014). Interestingly also the fungal plant pathogen Blakesleatrispora has been recognized as a commercial source to producelycopene (Mantzouridou and Tsimidou, 2008). Several foodshigh in lycopene content are classified as functional foods (Nazet al., 2014). Tomato juice, paste, puree, ketchup, sauce or souprepresent lycopene sources with improved bioavailability due tothermal treatment, but also because processing releases lycopenefrom the fibrous cell structure matrix (Basu and Imrhan, 2007;Thies et al., 2012; Burton-Freeman and Sesso, 2014).Not only lycopene intake counts, but also its serumconcentration may influence cardiovascular risk. Low serumand adipose tissue lycopene levels were correlated with earlyatherosclerosis, and major acute coronary and cerebrovascularevents, and were found to bemore reliable in risk assessment thanthe daily intake of lycopene (Agarwal and Rao, 2000; Rissanenet al., 2001; Kim et al., 2011). Oxidative stress and inflammationare responsible for a reduced level of antioxidants (Kim et al.,2010). Smoking is a potent oxidative stressor, able to impairarterial elasticity and endothelial function (Kim et al., 2010;Mozos et al., 2017b), and lycopene was the only major serumcarotenoid able to reduce the atherosclerotic risk in current andformer smokers according to the Rotterdam Study (Klipstein-Grobusch et al., 2000).CARDIOVASCULAR PROTECTIVEMECHANISMSLycopene has several cardiovascular beneficial effects, suchas an antioxidative, antiinflammatory, anti-atherogenic,cardioprotective, and antiplatelet effect, improving endothelialfunction (nitric oxide bioavailability and blood flow), themetabolic profile (by impairing cholesterol synthesis) and bloodpressure control (Figure 2) (Klipstein-Grobusch et al., 2000;Heber and Lu, 2002; Ahuja et al., 2006; Basu and Imrhan, 2007;Verghese et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2010; Kong et al., 2010; Riccioniet al., 2010; Ried and Fakler, 2011; B\u00f6hm, 2012; Wolak andParan, 2013; Gajendragadkar et al., 2014; Naz et al., 2014; M\u00fclleret al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2017; Milani et al., 2017).Antioxidative and Protective EndothelialEffectsLycopene is considered an effective singlet oxygen quencherin the carotenoids group (Kong et al., 2010; Viuda-Martoset al., 2014). It is a much more potent antioxidant than alpha-tocopherol (10\u00d7more potent) or beta-carotene (twice as potent)(Kim et al., 2010; Kong et al., 2010). Lycopene modulates alsothe production of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxidedismutase and catalase (B\u00f6hm, 2012; Pereira et al., 2017).Lycopene can also scavenge peroxynitrite, resulting oxidizedlycopene products (Pisoschi and Pop, 2015).Oxidative stress causes endothelial dysfunction due touncoupling of the nitric oxide synthase and oxidative injury ofthe endothelial cells (Mozos and Luca, 2017). Both are associatedwith inflammation. By reducing oxidative stress and reactiveoxygen species, lycopene increases the bioavailability of nitricoxide (NO), improves endothelium-dependent vasodilationand reduces protein, lipids, DNA, and mitochondrial damage(Hollman et al., 2011; Naz et al., 2014; Nakamura et al., 2017;Abdel-Daim et al., 2018).Endothelial NO enables vasodilation, inhibits plateletfunctions, and adhesion and transmigration of white blood cells,and reduces smooth muscle cell proliferation (Opatrilova et al.,2017). Watermelon supplementation, due to L-citrulline content,increases plasma L-arginine, enabling NO production (Figueroaet al., 2017), because NO is synthesized from L-arginine byNO synthase in virtually all cell types (Jobgen et al., 2006).Lycopene supplementation improved endothelial mediatedvasodilation in cardiovascular disease patients, but not inhealthy controls (Gajendragadkar et al., 2014), suggesting theimportance of lycopene in secondary cardiovascular prevention(Costa-Rodrigues et al., 2018).In summary, lycopene scavenges both reactive oxygenand nitrogen species, increases the production of antioxidantenzymes and protects the endothelial cells from oxidativedamage.Anti-inflammatory EffectInflammation is related to atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, andmajor cardiovascular events. The anti-inflammatory role oflycopene was demonstrated by several studies (Hung et al., 2008;Kim et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2012; He et al., 2016). Hung et al.revealed that lycopene can inhibit TNF-alpha induced NF-kappaB activation, expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1), and interaction between monocytes and endothelialcells, which might explain the cardiovascular benefits of lycopene(Hung et al., 2008). In a different study with Korean women,lycopene levels were found to correlate with cytokines, but nocorrelation with acute phase reactants was found, probably dueto lycopene\u2019s inhibitory effect on the formation of oxidizedLDL (Kim et al., 2010). Xu et al. found an inverse associationof lycopene with vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1),which enable adhesion of monocytes to the endothelial cells,but could not verify any association between serum lycopeneconcentration and atherosclerosis in their study as suggested byearlier studies (Xu et al., 2012). In the same context, Gianetti et al.reported no significant correlations between plasma lycopeneand soluble adhesion molecules (Gianetti et al., 2002). Lycopeneobtained from red guava exerts several anti-inflammatoryeffects besides modulation of inflammatory mediators, suchas inhibition of leukocyte mobilization, stabilization of mastcells, and inhibition of genes which expression is involved ininflammation (Vasconcelos et al., 2017).Lycopene can also reduce the secretion of metalloproteinasesby macrophages and inhibit T lymphocyte activation (Thieset al., 2017). Recently, lycopene was found as an effectiveantiglycation agent, able to reduce the synthesis of advancedglycation end-products (AGE), downregulating the expressionof their receptors (RAGE), which further contributes to vesselprotection (Tabrez et al., 2015; Thies et al., 2017).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521107Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthFIGURE 1 | Chemical structures of lycopene and other carotenoids.Tomato products reduced oxidative stress related topostprandial lipemia and the associated inflammatory reactionin a study including normal weight participants (Burton-Freeman et al., 2012). He et al. reported the benefits of lycopenein preventing transplant vasculopathy, demonstrating thatintimal hyperplasia and smooth muscle cell proliferation werereduced by the administration of lycopene and the infiltrationof inflammatory cells in allograft vessels was reduced in ananimal model (He et al., 2016). Lycopene can ameliorate allograftatherosclerosis via downregulating Rho-associated kinases andregulating the expression of key factors through NO/cGMPpathways (He et al., 2016). On the other hand, the benefitsof the tomato-rich diet were not directly related to the anti-inflammatory effect according to a randomized study including103 apparently healthy volunteers, after 300 g tomatoes daily for1 month or placebo (Blum et al., 2007).Watermelon was shown to reduce levels of inflammationby downregulation of the proinflammatory mediatorcyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), impairing prostaglandin E2 and I2production, which reduces the progression of cardiovasculardisorders (Sellers et al., 2010; Hong et al., 2015). Watermelonpowder supplementation exerts an anti-inflammatory effectsimilar to COX-2 inhibitors or conventional non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (Hong et al., 2015).High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a non-histone DNAbinding protein, produced by necrotic and immune cells,exposed to pro-inflammatory signals, has an important pro-inflammatory effect by attracting and activating inflammatorycells and mediators and binding to RAGE and toll-likereceptors, related to fatal outcomes (Lee et al., 2012). Leeet al. demonstrated that lycopene inhibits adhesion moleculesexpression, which impair HMGB1\u2014induced monocyte adhesionFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521108Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthFIGURE 2 | Cardiovascular benefits of lycopene [supported by in vivo (*) and/or in vitro (8) findings].and transmigration (Lee et al., 2012). Lycopene has been alsoshown to inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced HMGB1 releaseand HMGB1-mediated secretion of TNF-alpha and secretoryphospholipase A2 (Lee et al., 2012).Oxysterols, the result of cholesterol auto-oxidation,accumulate in the subendothelial arterial layer, exertingoxidative and pro-inflammatory roles and favoring theatherosclerotic process (Palozza et al., 2011). Lycopene impairsoxysterol-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines production inhuman macrophages and oxysterol-induced ROS production,limiting the formation of atherosclerotic plaque (Palozza et al.,2011).Lycopene exerts a cardioprotective effect against atrazineinduced cardiac injury due to its anti-inflammatory effect, byblocking the NF-kappa B pathway and NO production (Li et al.,2017).Considering the mentioned anti-inflammatory mechanisms(Figure 3), including decrease of adhesion molecules, pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibition of leukocyte migrationand genes involved in inflammation, impaired monocyte-endothelium interaction, T lymphocytes activation and synthesisof AGE and RAGE and downregulation of cyclooxygenase 2,lycopene can be useful in the therapy for vascular inflammatorydisorders.Modulation of LipidsLycopene is transported in the circulation by lipoproteins andis actively taken up into adipocytes (McEneny et al., 2013).Lycopene is a regulator of cholesterol levels by inhibition ofHMG-CoA reductase (like statins) and down-regulation ofproprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 mRNA synthesis.These results suggest that lycopene supplementation could beespecially beneficial for patients with statin intolerance (SultanAlvi et al., 2017). Changes in hepatic gene expression, suchas reduced expression in fatty acid synthase, responsible forfatty acid storage, were described after watermelon powderconsumption in rats (Hong et al., 2015). Carbonic anhydrase IIIand adenylate kinase 2 were involved in the lipid-lowering andantioxidant effects of tomatoes (Hsu et al., 2008). On the otherhand, NO stimulates fatty acid oxidation and lipolysis in adiposecells (Jobgen et al., 2006; Hong et al., 2015).Lycopene is not able to increase HDL cholesterol, but wasshown to improve the LDL/HDL ratio, HDL functionality andreduced the accumulation of cholesterol in the rabbit aorta,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521109Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthFIGURE 3 | Anti-inflammatory effects of lycopene. MMPs, matrixmetalloproteinases; COX-2, cyclooxigenase 2; AGE, advanced glycationend-products; RAGE, receptors of AGE.underlining the beneficial effects of lycopene during initialstages of atherosclerosis (Lorenz et al., 2012; Thies et al.,2017). However, a recent meta-analysis found that significantreductions in total and LDL cholesterol were revealed only atdoses of, at least, 25mg lycopene/day in human subjects, and theeffects were comparable with low-dose statinmedication, withoutconcomitant side effects (Ried and Fakler, 2011; Lorenz et al.,2012). Fecal cholesterol excretion increases with levels of dietarylycopene due to decreased intestinal cholesterol absorption. Thiscan be explained by the insight that increased fecal excretionimpairs the enterohepatic circuit of bile acids, thus increasing theconversion of cholesterol to bile acids (Verghese et al., 2008). Thelipid lowering properties of lycopene involve also an increasedactivity of LDL receptors in macrophages (Li et al., 2015; Chenget al., 2017).Lycopene can lower synthesis of dysfunctional HDL,modulating HDL functionality toward an antiatherogenicphenotype, with a low serum amyloid A level and beneficialchanges of the activity of HDL remodeling enzymes (cholesterolester transfer protein and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase)(McEneny et al., 2013). A hypotriglyceridemic effect of tomatojuice was seen only in subjects with initial high serum triglyceridelevels (Li et al., 2015).Lycopen can also regulate the hepatic lipid metabolism andcounteracts the hepatic steatosis induced by a high-fat diet,due to sirtuins (SIRT1) induction and activation, being able tosuppresses lipogenesis, to stimulate lipid catabolism in the liverand skeletal muscles and lipid mobilization in the white adiposetissue (Lomb et al., 2010; Li et al., 2015). Another mechanism ableto ameliorate liver steatosis, by lycopene, was described in miceand is related to decrease of fatty acid binding protein 7 due tobinding to microRNA-21 (Ahn et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015).In summary, lycopene has lipid lowering properties, reducingthe total and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride level, LDL oxidation,and synthesis of dysfunctional HDL.Anti-aggregative EffectPlatelets are involved in the pathogenesis of the atheroscleroticplaque, development of acute thrombotic events and restenosisafter endovascular procedures (Krasinska et al., 2017; O\u2019Kennedyet al., 2017). Another cardiovascular beneficial effect of lycopene,protecting against myocardial infarction and stroke, is itsantiplatelet activity, which is concentration dependent, and wasdemonstrated in vivo and in vitro (Sawardekar et al., 2016).Several mechanisms were considered in explaining the reversibleantiplatelet effect of lycopene, such as the interaction withthromboxane, thrombin, collagen, von Willebrand factor, P-selectin and inflammatory mediators, the influence on calciumand cyclic guanosine monophosphate signaling and ADP-mediated aggregation (Sawardekar et al., 2016; Krasinskaet al., 2017). It was noticed that lycopene can potentiatethe antiplatelet effect of aspirin, which requires low lycopenediet in patients on secondary prophylaxis with aspirin due tothe potential bleeding risk (Sawardekar et al., 2016). On theother hand, in high cardiovascular risk, aspirin (ASP) resistantpatients, or those with ASP contraindications, high risk ofcomplications after antiplatelet therapy or hyperactive platelets(obese, sedentary, hypertensive, diabetic, aging patients, andsmokers), lycopene could have an important contribution incardiovascular prophylaxis (Sawardekar et al., 2016; Krasinskaet al., 2017; O\u2019Kennedy et al., 2017).Antihypertensive EffectLycopene has antihypertensive effects due to inhibition of theangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and due to its antioxidanteffect, reducing oxidative stress induced by angiotensin-IIand indirectly enhancing production of nitric oxide in theendothelium (Li and Xu, 2013; Belovic et al., 2016; Khanet al., 2016; Han and Liu, 2017). A study including 8,556 adultoverweight and obese participants demonstrated association oflycopene and lycopene/uric acid ratio with lower prevalenceof hypertension (Han and Liu, 2017). Paran et al. reporteda decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in54 patients with moderate hypertension, treated with ACEinhibitors or calcium channel blockers, after 6 weeks of tomatoextract supplementation, suggesting a cause-effect relationship(Paran et al., 2009). Li et al. concluded, in a metanalysis,that lycopene supplementation (more than 12 mg/day) mightsignificantly reduce systolic, but not diastolic blood pressure, inprehypertensive or hypertensive patients (Li and Xu, 2013).Angiotensin II induces, besides direct vasoconstriction andoxidative stress, also vascular smooth muscle cells phenotypictransformation and production of inflammatory cytokines (Renet al., 2017), and lycopene might impair the mentioned pathways,as well.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521110Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthAnti-atherosclerotic MechanismsBesides improving endothelial function, oxidative stress(preventing oxidation of LDL) and metabolic profile, the anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effect, lycopene has several otheranti-atherosclerotic contributions (Figure 4), such as inhibitionof vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and foamcell formation (Napolitano et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2014).In general, not all studies confirm the relationship betweenlycopene and early atherosclerosis (Kim et al., 2010).Contractile VSMC change to a proliferative and migratoryphenotype during the atherosclerotic process, enablingmigrationof VSMC into the intima and production of the extracellularmatrix of the plaque (Karagiannis et al., 2013). Such changesin phenotype are called \u201cphenotypic modulation\u201d (Manabe andNagai, 2003) and play an important role in vascular remodeling,not only due to atherosclerosis, but also in hypertension anddiabetic macroangiopathy (Ren et al., 2017). Lycopene cansuppress VSMCs proliferation, due to inhibiting G1 phase cellsentry into the S phase of the cell cycle, related to its antioxidativeeffect (Chen et al., 2010), and not due to the inhibition ofmatrix metalloproteinases (Lo et al., 2007). Minimally-oxidizedLDL can induce phenotypic modulation of VSMC (Karagianniset al., 2013), and synthesis of oxidized LDL may be impairedby lycopene (Kim et al., 2010). Lycopene may block VSMCmigration and proliferation also by direct binding to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and inhibiting PDGF-signaling(Lo et al., 2007), or due to it antioxidant effect, considering thatreactive oxygen species accelerate the switch from the contractileto the synthetic phenotype (Sung et al., 2005).Lycopene has also barrier integrity activity in the endothelialmembrane, by blocking the activation of CD14 and TollFIGURE 4 | Anti-atherosclerotic effect of lycopene. oxLDL, oxidized LDL;VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells.like receptor-4 expression (Bae and Bae, 2011) and impairsthe apoptosis of endothelial cells in vitro, by disrupting theupregulation of p53 and caspase 3 mRNA (Tang et al., 2009).Cardioprotective EffectsRecent studies emphasized the cardioprotective effectsof lycopene. An experimental study including rats withisoproterenol induced myocardial infarction, demonstratedimproved ECG findings (shorter QT and RR intervals andQRS complexes, reduced ST segment elevation) if lycopene waspreviously administrated, related to its cell membrane stabilizingand antioxidant properties (Aman et al., 2012). Supplementationof lycopene in the same study also prevented alteration inhemodynamic parameters (systolic, diastolic, and mean bloodpressure), biochemical and inflammatory markers, apoptoticchanges, and reduced the size of myocardial infarction due tothe antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of lycopene(Aman et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2017).Tomato and lycopene supplementation attenuated cardiac-remodeling and improved diastolic dysfunction after myocardialinfarction according to a study including male Wistar rats,enabled by impairing type I and type III collagen content inthe left ventricle, reduced cardiomyocyte death, expression ofmiRNAs and by the anti-inflammatory effect and reduction ofoxidative stress (Pereira et al., 2017). Wang et al. administeredlycopene in infarcted rats for 28 days, revealing an increasedejection fraction compared to controls, associated with decreasedcollagen fraction in the peri-infarct zone, due to inhibition of p38mitogen-activated protein kinase and matrix metalloproteinase9 expression (Wang et al., 2014). Lycopene effect on interstitialcollagen accumulation was not confirmed by Anjos Ferreira et al.,in a study including male Wistar rats and testing the effect oflycopene on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (Anjos Ferreiraet al., 2007). The anti-inflammatory effect of lycopene has alsoa contribution in reversing ventricular remodeling, by inhibitingthe nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling pathway (He et al., 2015).Lycopene might also serve as a cardioprotective agentagainst several drugs. The cardioprotective effect of lycopenewas demonstrated in the case of tulathromycin, a macrolideantibiotic, and diclofenac sodium, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, by Abdel-Daim et al., in a study includingSwiss albino mice, and was attributed to its antioxidant activity(Abdel-Daim et al., 2018). Lycopene can also protect againstthe cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin (Karimi et al., 2005;Anjos Ferreira et al., 2007; Abushouk et al., 2017), isoproterenol(Aman et al., 2012; Mohamadin et al., 2012), and atrazine (Liet al., 2017).Concluding, lycopene supplementation is beneficial for earlyand late prognosis in myocardial infarction. It may reducemyocardial infarction size and related electrocardiographic,hemodynamic, and biochemical changes (Aman et al.,2012). Lycopene also reverses ventricular extracellular matrixremodeling after an acute coronary event, by inhibitingmyocardial fibrosis and preventing apoptosis and necrosis ofcardiomyocytes, its anti-inflammatory effect and the ability toincrease left ventricular function, preventing development ofheart failure and increasing survival rates (Aman et al., 2012;Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521111Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthWang et al., 2014; He et al., 2015). Considering difficultiesand high cost of early revascularization and significant sideeffects of cardiovascular drugs, lycopene could represent a safeand effective option in controlling post infarction ventricularremodeling (Wang et al., 2014).Lycopene and Endoplasmic ReticulumStress (ERS)The endoplasmic reticulum has several functions related tointracellular calcium storage, lipid and protein synthesis, andmodification (Sch\u00f6nthal, 2012). Disturbance of those functionscauses \u201cendoplasmic reticulum stress\u201d (ERS) involved inmyocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (Gao et al., 2016). Thecell reacts to ERS by initiating an \u201cunfolded protein response,\u201dincluding several mechanisms, enabling cellular adaptation andsurvival or, in severe cases, apoptosis (Sch\u00f6nthal, 2012).Lycopene protects the cardiomyocytes by relieving ERSand preventing apoptosis, through stimulation of adenosine 5-monophosphate-activated proteinkinase, the transcription factorCHOP (C/EBP homologous protein), p-JNK and Caspasepathways (Xu et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2016). However, highlycopene levels might be toxic to the cardiomyocytes (Gao et al.,2016).PRECLINICAL STUDIESLycopene supplementation for 4 weeks strongly reduced totaland LDL serum cholesterol and the amount of cholesterolin the aorta, but the surface lipid accumulation in the aortaand IMT were not significantly reduced and no impairmentof vasoreactivity or increase of pro-oxidant parameters weredetected in New Zealand White rabbits after either a standard ora high-cholesterol diet (Lorenz et al., 2012). Although lycopenesuppressed cholesterol uptake and intestinal absorption andincreased fecal cholesterol excretion in rabbits, it did not decreasethe expression of HMG-CoA reductase (Lorenz et al., 2012).Hu et al. reported anti-atherosclerotic effects for bothlycopene and fluvastatin, in the aorta, in rabbits, after a high-fatdiet (Hu et al., 2008; He et al., 2009). Verghese et al. also revealeda significant decrease in the atherosclerotic plaque formationwith the consumption of lycopene in a study including NewZealand male rabbits, receiving a high cholesterol diet. Furtherobserved effects include an improved serum lipid profile as wellas reduction in total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides (Vergheseet al., 2008). Hsu reported, besides reduction in total and LDLcholesterol and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, also anincrease in HDL cholesterol in hamsters fed a 9% tomato pastecontaining 0.2% cholesterol, after 8 weeks (Hsu et al., 2008).Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic rabbits were used in astudy by Frederiksen et al. demonstrating that lycopene didnot influence cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels, lipoproteinfractions, oxidation of lipids, and aortic atherosclerosis evaluatedbiochemically and by microscopy (Frederiksen et al., 2007).The lack of response of lycopene in Watanabe HeritableHyperlipidemic rabbits is, probably, related to their defectiveLDL receptors (Tanazawa et al., 1980; Lorenz et al., 2012),which would suggest the involvement of these receptors inthe cardiovascular benefits of lycopene (Perera and Yen, 2007).Considering the bloodstream transport of lycopene in LDLparticles, functional LDL receptors enable cardiovascular benefitsof lycopene (Lorenz et al., 2012). Bansal et al. reporteda beneficial cardioprotective effect of lycopene, due to thereduction of oxidative stress and myocardial injury, in anexperimental model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injuryin adult male albino Wistar rats (Bansal et al., 2006). Lycopeneprotects also endothelial progenitor cells, necessary to replacethe injured vascular endothelium and for angiogenesis, in amicroenvironment of advanced glycation end products (AGEs),which act as damage-causing agents (Zeng et al., 2017). Lycopeneimproved cell proliferation and regulated protective mechanismsof AGEs-induced autophagy in endothelial progenitor cellsfrom diabetic rats, suggesting that supplementation with thiscompound might be a new therapeutic option for diabeticvascular complications (Zeng et al., 2017).CLINICAL RESEARCHEndothelial FunctionBoth cross-sectional and supplementation studies emphasizedthe benefits of tomato products on vascular function, mainlydue to the antioxidative effects of lycopene (Kim et al., 2010;Thies et al., 2012; Xaplanteris et al., 2012; Gajendragadkar et al.,2014). However, several articles failed to show improvement ofendothelial function after tomato consumption (Stangl et al.,2011; Table 1).Gajendragadkar et al. concluded that lycopenesupplementation can improve endothelial function in patientswith cardiovascular disorders, but not in age-matched healthyvolunteers (Gajendragadkar et al., 2014). Forearm responsesto intraarterial infusions of acetylcholine were assessed usingvenous plethysmography, which resulted in an improvement by53% of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDV) in patientswith cardiovascular disorders post-lycopene (Gajendragadkaret al., 2014). Endothelial function was improved regardless oftraditional risk factors or inflammatory markers, and, even amodest increase in serum lycopene, further impaired endothelialfunction in atherosclerotic patients (Gajendragadkar et al., 2014).One conclusion of the mentioned study was that lycopene affectsespecially smaller vessels, such as resistance arteries, rather thanlarger vessels, as measured arterial stiffness remained unalteredin all study participants (Gajendragadkar et al., 2014).Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV)Kim et al. reported an independent, inverse association betweencirculating lycopene and brachial pulse wave velocity in 264healthy women, regardless of age, body mass index, smokingand drinking habits, menopause, blood pressure, beta-carotene,alpha-tocopherol, markers of oxidative stress, and inflammation(Kim et al., 2010; Table 1). Reduced oxidative LDL changes mayhave an important contribution to arterial stiffness reductiondue to lycopene (Kim et al., 2010). Another study, including126 healthy men revealed the benefits of lycopene on oxidativestress and endothelial dysfunction, especially in subjects with anFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521112Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthTABLE 1 | Effects of lycopene on endothelial function and arterial stiffness.Number of participants Methodology Results, conclusions References36 statin treated cardiovascularpatients (mean age: 67\u201368years) and 36 healthy volunteers(mean age: 61\u201368 years)Double-blind trial: 7mg lycopene or placebodaily for 2 months.Lycopene supplementation improvedendothelial function in patients withcardiovascular disorders on optimalsecondary prevention, but not in healthypersons.Gajendragadkar et al.,2014225 overweight volunteers, aged40\u201365 yearsParticipants were randomly assigned into 1 of 3dietary intervention groups: control diet (lowtomato content), a high-tomato-content diet, ora control diet with addition of lycopenecapsules (10 mg/d) for 12 wk. Collected bloodsamples were tested for carotenoid and lipidprofiles and inflammatory markers. Arterialstiffness and dietary intake were alsomonitored.A relatively high daily consumption oftomato-based products (32\u201350mglycopene/day) or lycopene supplements(10 mg/day) was ineffective in reducingconventional cardiovascular risk markers,inflammatory markers, markers of insulinresistance and sensitivity, lipid profile andarterial stiffness in moderately overweight,healthy, middle-aged individuals.Thies et al., 201225 study participants, mean age:27 \u00b1 8 yearsRandomized, intervention model, crossoverassignment. The participants consumedhigh-fat meals containing processed tomatoproducts or non-tomato alternative.Tomato products attenuate postprandiallipemia-induced oxidative stress andinflammatory response, with a modestimproved flow-mediated dilatation (FMD).Burton-Freeman et al.,201219 volunteers, 39 \u00b1 13 years Randomized, single-blind, crossoverassignment.Daily tomato paste consumption exerts abeneficial midterm effect on endothelialfunction.Xaplanteris et al., 2012299 Korean men Subgrouped according to the number ofmetabolic syndrome risk factors; brachial-anklepulse wave velocity (PWV), oxidative stress andantioxidants (including lycopene) weremeasured.An inverse correlation was found betweenPWV and serum lycopene, consideringblood pressure, insulin resistance andoxidative stress.Yeo et al., 201119 healthy non-smokingpostmenopausal womenAdministration of 70 g tomato puree.Endothelial-dependent FMD andendothelial-independent nitro-mediated dilationof the brachial artery were measured withhigh-resolution ultrasound.Acute and long-term (7 d) intake of tomatoproducts, despite a significant increase inplasma lycopene had no effect onendothelial function.Stangl et al., 2011126 healthy men Administration of placebo/6 mg/15mglycopene daily for 8 weeks. Endothelial functionwas assessed by reactive hyperemia peripheralarterial tonometry. Plasma superoxidedismutase was used to assess oxidative stress.An inverse correlation between serumlycopene levels and arterial stiffness wasfound. An increased serum lycopenedecreases oxidative stress, which mightinfluence endothelial function.Kim et al., 2011264 healthy women, 31\u201375 years The relationship between serum lycopene andbrachial-ankle pulse wave velocity wasassessed.An independent, inverse relationshipbetween circulating lycopene and brachialPWV was observed.Kim et al., 2010impaired endothelial function (Kim et al., 2011). After 15 mg/daylycopene supplementation, for 8 weeks, Kim et al. reported adecrease of systolic blood pressure and high sensitivity C reactiveprotein (Kim et al., 2011).The main biological mechanism by which lycopene reducesthe risk and mortality of the metabolic syndrome, includethe antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiobesity effects, theability to improve endothelial function, glycemic control, insulinsensitivity and lipid profile (Tsitsimpikou et al., 2014; Liet al., 2015; Han et al., 2016a,b). An inverse relationship wasfound by Yeo et al. between lycopene level and brachial-anklepulse wave velocity (Yeo et al., 2011). PWV was significantlyhigher in patients with metabolic syndrome, with lower thanmedian serum lycopene values (\u22640.0294 mmol/l) compared topatients without metabolic syndrome; no statistically significantdifferences between the 2 groups were found when lycopenelevels were high (Fantin et al., 2010; Yeo et al., 2011).Higher serum carotenoid levels were associated not just witha lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, but also withfewer abnormal metabolic syndrome components. A significantassociation between lycopene and the metabolic syndrome wasdescribed only for normal-weight and overweight participants,but not in obese patients, according to a study enrolling 13,196subjects, probably related to an increased oxidative stress anddecreased antioxidant ability, due to sequestration of lycopenein the adipose tissue and more important inflammation in obese(Han et al., 2016b). On the other hand, daily tomato juiceintake reduced waist circumference, cholesterol, and monocytechemotactic protein-1 (inflammatory adipokine) and increasedadiponectin (anti-inflammatory adipokine) levels in 30 young,healthy Taiwanese females (Li et al., 2015). Lycopene was shownto impair pro-inflammatory cytokine production, such as IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF-\u03b1, preventing insulin resistance (Gourantonet al., 2011).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521113Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthL-arginine or L-citrulline supplementation modulate thearginine-NO pathway, enabled by multiple cyclic guanosine-3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate-dependent pathways, with importantprophylactic and therapeutic contributions in the metabolicsyndrome (Jobgen et al., 2006).A large study, including 225 middle-aged, overweightvolunteers reported no changes of conventional cardiovascularrisk factors, inflammatory tests, insulin resistance and sensitivity,lipid profile, oxidized LDL, von Willebrand factor, and arterialstiffness after high daily intake of lycopene, despite goodcompliance (Thies et al., 2012). One week of lycopenesupplementation increased plasma lycopene, but not biomarkersof vascular oxidative stress and inflammation, or biomarkers ofnitric oxide (plasma nitrate/nitrite) in healthy, active subjects,suggesting that the participants already possessed a robustantioxidant capacity and lycopene provided no additional benefit(Denniss et al., 2008).Intima-Media Thickness (IMT)Several studies reported an association between serum lycopenelevels and intima-media thickness (Gianetti et al., 2002; Riccioniet al., 2009, 2011; Karppi et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2014), whileother authors reported no association (Dwyer et al., 2004;Table 2). Zou et al. revealed a decrease in carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) after 12 months of lutein and lycopenesupplementation (20mg each) in 144 Chinese patients withsubclinical atherosclerosis, demonstrating more effective resultsafter the intake of both lutein and lycopene compared to luteinalone (Zou et al., 2014).High serum levels of lycopene, alpha and beta-carotene wereassociated with a slow IMT progression during 7 years in a studyincluding 840 middle-aged men from Eastern Finland (Karppiet al., 2013). The association between lycopene level and IMTwas mentioned in the scientific literature also for elderly Finishsubjects (Karppi et al., 2011).Higher carotenoids levels (lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta-cryptoxanthin; Figure 1) were correlated with reduced IMTprogression over 18 months, in a study with 573 middle-agedparticipants, free of cardiovascular symptoms at baseline. Beta-carotene and lycopene levels were not significantly associatedwith IMT progression (Dwyer et al., 2004).An inverse correlation was found in women between lycopenelevels and IMT, independent of conventional risk factors, in alarge study including 1,111 subjects (McQuillan et al., 2001).WHY CONFLICTING RESULTS?Several studies revealed the anti-atherosclerotic effect of lycopene(McQuillan et al., 2001; Gianetti et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2008;Verghese et al., 2008; Riccioni et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010;Gajendragadkar et al., 2014), but there are also studies availablethat report conflicting results related to the vascular effects oflycopene (McQuillan et al., 2001; Dwyer et al., 2004; Stanglet al., 2011; Thies et al., 2012). The possible reasons for thisobvious discrepancy are manifold and include methodologicaldifferences in the study designs, such as different lycopenesources, the use of food-frequency questionnaires, differentintervention times, the methodology used to assess vascularfunction, measurement of blood, adipose or dietary lycopene.Besides those, the use of unstandardized amounts of tomatofood products, different modes of delivery, misclassificationof overall tomato intake, combination of lycopene with otherantioxidants, different processing procedures or eating behaviorinfluenced by cultural and temporal patterns among differentindividuals, may influence the results (Sesso et al., 2003; Konget al., 2010; Thies et al., 2012; Gajendragadkar et al., 2014).Other carotenoids extracted from tomatoes could be also partiallyresponsible for the effects attributed to lycopene (Rao, 2002).This is underlined by a study that could not find beneficialeffects for lycopene supplementation alone, but beneficial effectsupon supplementation with tomato-based products (Sesso et al.,2003). Some studies did not consider dietary intake at all (Yeoet al., 2011). The interaction flavanone metabolites\u2014lycopeneis difficult to assess, considering the rapid metabolization ofthe mentioned metabolites (Habauzit et al., 2015). Duration oftreatment, dose and bioavailability of lycopene, and vascularendpoint were also different in the studies published on thistopic and might have influenced obtained results. Several factorsinfluence the bioavailability of lycopene, such as season, theprocessing of tomatoes, their origin, dimensions, shape, and theway they are consumed (Gajendragadkar et al., 2014; Gammoneet al., 2015). Absorption of lycopene may be reduced by diets richin fibers and in elderly people (Kong et al., 2010) and is increasedin the presence of oil.The isomerization of lycopene is another source of variability.Fresh tomatoes contain lycopene in all-trans form (Shi andLe Maguer, 2000). Several factors, including high temperatures,light, oxygen, acids, and metal ions enable isomerization oflycopene (Kong et al., 2010). Lycopene degradation occurs duringthermal processing, mainly isomerization of all- trans to cisforms and oxidation (Shi and Le Maguer, 2000). Dehydrated andpowdered tomatoes have poor lycopene stability, depending ofstorage in a hermetically sealed atmosphere, and a significantincrease of cis-isomers, giving the highest bioavailability oflycopene and higher ability to be incorporated in lipoproteins(Shi and Le Maguer, 2000; Kong et al., 2010). Uptake of cislycopene is significantly higher than all trans-isomers (Konget al., 2010).Lycopene is very bioavailable in the presence of oil, especiallyin monounsaturated oils, other dietary fats and processed tomatoproducts (Shi and Le Maguer, 2000; Basu and Imrhan, 2007;Kong et al., 2010; Gajendragadkar et al., 2014). Lycopene canincrease the antioxidant properties of vitamin C, E, polyphenolsand beta-carotene in a synergistic way (Kong et al., 2010;Karppi et al., 2013). Supplementation with tomatoes, containinglycopene (red tomatoes) or not (yellow tomatoes), showed abetter antioxidant effect than lycopene alone, probably dueto the synergistic effects of naturally occurring secondarymetabolites in tomatoes (Basu and Imrhan, 2007; Gitenay et al.,2007). Generally, supplementation with whole fruits is oftenmore beneficial than supplementing single food constituents:Watermelons contain, besides lycopene, hundreds of differentcompounds, including L-citrulline and ascorbic acid, both ofwhich improve the L-arginine/NOpathway, endothelial function,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521114Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthTABLE 2 | Lycopene and intima-media thickness (IMT).Number of participants Methodology Results, conclusions References144 subjects, aged 45\u201368 years,with subclinical atherosclerosis20mg lutein (n = 48), 20mg lutein + 20mglycopene (n = 48) or placebo (n = 48) wereadministrated for 12 months; carotid arteryintima-media thickness (IMT) was measuredusing Doppler ultrasonography.Lutein and lycopene supplementationsignificantly increased the serumconcentration of lutein and lycopene witha decrease in carotid artery IMT.Zou et al., 2014840 middle-aged men fromEastern FinlandUltrasonography of the common carotidarteries, serum levels of carotenoids7-year change in maximum intima mediathickness was inversely associated withserum levels of lycopene, alpha andbeta-carotene, respectively. Elevatedserum levels of carotenoids may haveanti-atherosclerotic effect.Karppi et al., 20131,212 elderly men from EasternFinlandB-mode ultrasound (IMT of the commoncarotid artery); plasma levels of carotenoidsHigh plasma concentrations of lycopene,alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthinare related to decreased carotidatherosclerosis in elderly patients.Karppi et al., 2011120 subjects without history ofsymptomatic carotid arterydiseaseUltrasonic measurement of common carotidartery IMT, serum profile analysis of cholesterol(total and LDL), triglycerides and lycopene.Carotid atherosclerosis was associatedwith lower plasma lycopene levels.Riccioni et al., 2011640 participants withasymptomatic carotidatherosclerosisCarotid ultrasound investigation wasperformed; medical history and laboratory datawere collected.Participants with IMT \u2265 0.8mm hadsignificantly lower concentrations ofvitamin A and E, lycopene, andbeta-carotene compared to participantswith no evidence of carotidatherosclerosis.Riccioni et al., 2011573 middle-aged women andmen from an occupational cohortUltrasound examination of the common carotidarteries was performed, lipid profile and riskfactors were assessed at baseline and18-month follow-up. Plasma antioxidants weredetermined at baseline.18-month change in IMT was inverselyrelated to serum levels of some measuredcarotenoids, not including lycopene,regardless of cardiac risk factors andhigh-sensitivity C-reactive protein.Dwyer et al., 200411 healthy controls, 11 patientswith uncomplicatedhypertension, 11 with essentialhypertension and peripheralvascular diseasePatients were matched for age, sex, smokinghabit and body mass index; IMT, adhesionmolecules, LDL and antioxidants (includinglycopene) were measured.A statistically significant correlation wasfound between lycopene and IMT,independent of LDL, creatinine clearance,and plasma insulin. No significantcorrelation was found between lycopeneand soluble adhesion moleculesGianetti et al., 20021,111 subjects, aged 27\u201377yearsDietary vitamin intake, fasting plasma levels ofvitamins (A, C, and E), lycopene, alpha andbeta-carotene, bilateralThere was an inverse association betweencarotid artery IMT and plasma lycopene inwomen, but not in men.McQuillan et al., 2001aortic systolic blood pressure, reduce arterial stiffness, andimprove glycemic control, thus acting synergistic with lycopene(Wu et al., 2007; Figueroa et al., 2013, 2017). Grapefruitsalso include in their composition not just lycopene but alsoflavonoids, with several benefits, such as the anti-inflammatoryand anti-atherogenic effect, improving vascular reactivity,reducing insulin resistance, decreasing arterial stiffness, LDLcholesterol, and blood pressure (Habauzit et al., 2015). Thesesynergistic effects hamper assessment of quantitative andqualitative effects of lycopene as a dietary factor.Several studies included healthy participants or subjectswith different disorders and cardiovascular risk factors (Konget al., 2010; Thies et al., 2012; Gajendragadkar et al., 2014).Enrolling volunteers with established elevated risk markersfor cardiovascular disorders may increase the probability ofdetecting changes, especially in short time studies (Thies et al.,2012). Also, several other uncontrolled or unidentified lifestylefactors or dietary constituents associated with cardiovasculardisorders, may provide alternative explanations for the differentstudy results (Sesso et al., 2003). Genetic factors remainunconsidered at all in all of the reviewed publications, althoughthey are reported to strongly influence circulating concentrationsof lycopene in different ethnicities (Zubair et al., 2015).Furthermore, plasma, adipose, and dietary carotenoids are notsufficiently correlated to be interchangeably (Sesso et al., 2003).FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONSMost of the studies considered only tomatoes and tomatoproducts as lycopene source. It will be the aim of futurehuman intervention studies to include other lycopene containingfruits such as watermelon, papaya, red grapefruits, and guava,and consider synergistic effects with other components andtheir importance in primary and secondary cardiovascularprophylaxis.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521115Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthBenefits of lycopene should be especially considered inpatients with high cardiovascular risk, statin intolerance,borderline hypertension, aspirin resistance, hyperactive platelets,vascular inflammatory diseases, metabolic syndrome andcoronary heart disease, and its inclusion in combinationtherapies for the mentioned disorders, should be approached.Further mechanistic research is needed to identify new targetsfor prevention and complementary treatment of cardiovasculardisorders.CONCLUSIONSThe present review supports the importance of lycopene inimproving vascular function and in the primary and secondaryprevention of cardiovascular disorders. The demonstrated effectsof lycopene in view of cardiovascular health comprise its generalantioxidant and anti-inflammatory abilities, the antiplatelet, anti-apoptotic and antihypertensive properties, the ability to improveendothelial function, the metabolic profile and ventricularremodeling, reduction of arterial stiffness as well as reductionof size of atherosclerotic plaque. Lycopene exerts favorableeffects in patients with subclinical atherosclerosis, metabolicsyndrome, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and severalother cardiovascular disorders, but sometimes conflicting resultswere obtained. Clearly, more and better-designed studies will benecessary to improve our understanding of the positive effectsof lycopene on vascular health and to elucidate the involvedmechanisms on a molecular level.Future cardiovascular disease prevention strategies mightinclude lycopene-enriched products, lycopene supplementationand new combinations including lycopene. Future studiesfocused on dietary lycopene and its synergistic effects withother dietary components in different study populations, withelevated cardiovascular risk, are highly warranted and mightenable development of functional foods useful in prevention andcomplementary treatment of cardiovascular disorders.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSIM is the author of the first draft of the manuscript.

Therefore, the identification of newtherapeutic strategies is of great importance. Since ancient times, frankincense isused in traditional medicine for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders suchas rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, the present study intends to evaluate if Casperome R\u00a9(Casp), an orally bioavailable soy lecithin-based formulation of standardized frankincenseextract, is able to ameliorate systemic effects and organ damages induced by severesystemic inflammation using a murine model of sepsis, i.e., intraperitoneal administrationof lipopolysaccharides (LPS).Methods: Male 60-day-old mice were assigned to six treatment groups: (1) control,(2) LPS, (3) soy lecithin (blank lecithin without frankincense extract), (4) Casp, (5) soylecithin plus LPS, or (6) Casp plus LPS. Soy lecithin and Casp were given 3 h priorto LPS treatment; 24 h after LPS administration, animals were sacrificed and healthstatus and serum cytokine levels were evaluated. Additionally, parameters representingliver damage or liver function and indicating oxidative stress in different organs weredetermined. Furthermore, markers for apoptosis and immune cell redistribution wereassessed by immunohistochemistry in liver and spleen.Results: LPS treatment caused a decrease in body temperature, blood glucose levels,liver glycogen content, and biotransformation capacity along with an increase in serumcytokine levels and oxidative stress in various organs. Additionally, apoptotic processeswere increased in spleen besides a pronounced immune cell infiltration in both liverand spleen. Pretreatment with Casp significantly improved health status, blood glucosevalues, and body temperature of the animals, while serum levels of pro-inflammatorycytokines and oxidative stress in all organs tested were significantly diminished. Finally,apoptotic processes in spleen, liver glycogen loss, and immune cell infiltration in liverand spleen were distinctly reduced. Casp also appears to induce various cytochromeFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387121fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 2Loeser et al.

Thus, orally bioavailable frankincense extracts may serve as a new supportivetreatment option in acute systemic inflammation and accompanied liver dysfunction.Keywords: frankincense, lipopolysaccharides, systemic inflammation, cytokines, oxidative stress, liver functionINTRODUCTIONDespite recent advances in critical care, sepsis, septic shock, andsubsequent multi-organ failure remain an important cause ofmorbidity and mortality in intensive care units (Engel et al.,2007; Martin, 2012; Gaieski et al., 2013). About 20\u201325% ofpatients with sepsis and associated organ failure display earlyimpaired liver function, which in severe cases can result in acuteliver failure (Kramer et al., 2007; Koch et al., 2011; Nesseleret al., 2012; Horvatits et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2014). Such liverdysfunction seems to be mediated to a considerable extent bypro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 thatare liberated by resident macrophages of the liver, the so-calledKupffer cells (Nesseler et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2014). Moreover,it has been shown that the severity of liver damage (even morethan the impairment of lung or kidney function) is of majorconsequence for overall patient outcome (Kramer et al., 2007;Koch et al., 2011; Nesseler et al., 2012; Horvatits et al., 2013; Yanet al., 2014). However, although extensive research efforts havebeen made, no specific therapy exists so far for the treatment ofsepsis and of sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (Nesseler et al.,2012; Horvatits et al., 2013). Therefore, the identification of newtherapeutic strategies is of great clinical importance (Yan et al.,2014).Extracts of frankincense gum resins from different Boswelliaspecies have been used for centuries in traditional medicine,e.g., in Indian Ayurveda medicine, in China, and in severalAfrican countries, to treat infectious diseases and chronicinflammatory disorders. But also in Europe, frankincenseextracts are commonly and increasingly used, and severalclinical trials have been conducted to demonstrate theirtherapeutic benefit (Abdel-Tawab et al., 2011). Recent datafrom both animal experiments and clinical trials revealedthat gum resin extracts from Boswellia species not only exertbeneficial effects in various inflammatory conditions such as, e.g.,rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019sdisease, multiple sclerosis, or bronchial asthma, but also inhyperlipidemia, obesity, and cancer (see e.g., Poeckel and Werz,2006; Moussaieff and Mechoulam, 2009; Abdel-Tawab et al.,Abbreviations: ALAT, alanine aminotransferase; BROD, benzyloxyresorufin-O-debenzylation; b.wt., body weight; Casp, Casperome R\u00a9; CD, clusterof differentiation; COX, cyclooxygenase; CSS, clinical severity score;CYP, cytochrome P450; ECOD, ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylation; EMND,ethylmorphine-N-demethylation; EROD, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation; GSH,reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; IL, interleukin; iNOS, induciblenitric oxide synthase; LPO, lipid peroxides; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MROD,methoxyresorufin-O-demethylation; NO, nitric oxide; Phyto, soy lecithin;PROD, pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylation; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactivesubstances; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.2011; Du et al., 2015; St\u00fcrner et al., 2017). Additionally, in2002 the European Medicines Agency classified Boswellia serrataextract as an \u201corphan drug\u201d for the treatment of peritumoralbrain edema. The main active principles of these extracts arepentacyclic triterpenes, termed boswellic acids, which are uniqueto Boswellia species (Ammon, 2006). Among others, there arefour important \u03b2-configurated boswellic acid derivatives: 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-\u03b2-boswellic acid (AKBA), 3-O-acetyl-\u03b2-boswellicacid (A\u03b2BA), 11-keto-\u03b2-boswellic acid (KBA), and \u03b2-boswellicacid (\u03b2-BA).The exact molecular basis for the pharmacological actionsof boswellic acids in chronic inflammatory conditions stillremains to be resolved. As possible target structures microsomalprostaglandin E2 synthase-1, 5-lipoxygenase, human leukocyteelastase, cathepsin G, topoisomerase I and II, as well as membersof the I\u03baB kinase/NF\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways have beenidentified (Syrovets et al., 2005; Poeckel and Werz, 2006; Takadaet al., 2006; Cuaz-P\u00e9rolin et al., 2008; Moussaieff and Mechoulam,2009; Siemoneit et al., 2009, 2011; Ammon, 2010; Abdel-Tawabet al., 2011). Additionally, using precipitation experiments withimmobilized boswellic acids, LPS has recently been identified as apossible direct molecular interaction partner of distinct boswellicacids and their synthetic derivatives (Henkel et al., 2012). Theauthors were also able to show that distinct boswellic acids areable to inhibit LPS-mediated effects in a series of cell-basedassays via direct binding to LPS. The experiments revealed clear-cut structure\u2013activity relationships and \u03b2-BA was found to bethe most potent derivative. These findings are further supportedby the fact that boswellic acids as well as frankincense resinextracts reduce LPS-induced NO and proinflammatory cytokineproduction in macrophages both in vitro and in vivo (Syrovetset al., 2000; Pandey et al., 2005; Gayathri et al., 2007; Sharmaet al., 2016), thereby exerting hepato- and renoprotective effects(Pandey et al., 2005).To the best of our knowledge, neither individual boswellicacids nor frankincense extracts have been evaluated for theireffects in acute systemic inflammatory conditions before.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigatefor the first time the impact of Casp, an orally bioavailablesoy lecithin-based delivery form of standardized frankincenseextract, in a murine model of acute systemic inflammation,i.e., the intraperitoneal administration of LPS. The LPS modelwas chosen based on the assumption of a direct interactionbetween boswellic acids, especially \u03b2-BA and LPS (Henkelet al., 2012). Additionally, in comparison to other sepsis animalmodels such as peritoneal contamination and infection with(human) stool bacteria (PCI) or cecal ligation and puncture(CLP), the LPS model has several essential advantages suchFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387122fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 3Loeser et al. Casperome R\u00a9 in Systemic Inflammationas technical ease and high reproducibility (Seemann et al.,2017; Stortz et al., 2017). Furthermore, the LPS model hasbeen proven to be most suitable for studying effects of newtherapies on acute systemic inflammation (Seemann et al.,2017). Casp is composed of Boswellia serrata extract and soylecithin in a 1:1 ratio, with about half part of microcrystallinecellulose added to improve physical stability. The formulationis standardized to contain \u226525% of triterpenoic acids byHPLC. Compared with poorly bioavailable non-formulatedfrankincense extracts, Casp provides a quicker absorption aswell as considerably higher plasma and tissue levels of themost important boswellic acids, including \u03b2-BA (H\u00fcsch et al.,2013; Riva et al., 2016). Since in rats maximum plasma levelswere reached after 180 min (H\u00fcsch et al., 2013), in thepresent study Casp was administered to the mice 3 h beforeLPS challenge; 24 h after LPS administration, animals of thedifferent treatment groups (soy lecithin alone; Casp alone; soylecithin plus LPS; Casp plus LPS) were evaluated in comparisonto control mice and to LPS-only-treated animals with regardto general condition, body temperature, blood glucose values,and serum cytokine concentrations. Additionally, parameters ofoxidative stress were determined in different organs and immunecell distribution in two organs decisively involved in sepsispathogenesis, the liver and spleen. Since liver function is ofimportance for overall patient outcome, liver glycogen contentand biotransformation capacity, representing two importantliver function parameters, were also assessed. Finally, to furthersubstantiate the animal studies, cell-based experiments usinghuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) wereperformed to confirm the suppressive effect of Casp on cytokinerelease in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and Experimental ProcedureThe study was conducted under the license of the ThuringianAnimal Protection Committee (approval number: 02-011/12).The principles of laboratory animal care and the German Law onthe Protection of Animals as well as the Directive 2010/63/EUwere followed. Male adult C57BL/6N mice (60-days-old, b.wt.25\u201330 g; Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany) wereused and the animals were housed in plastic cages understandardized conditions (light\u2013dark cycle 12/12 h, temperature22 \u00b1 2\u25e6C, humidity 50 \u00b1 10%, pellet diet Altromin 1316, waterad libitum).A total of 48 mice were randomly divided into six groups(n = 8 each): control (vehicle-treated animals; 0.9% NaCl, usedfor dissolution of LPS), LPS, soy lecithin, Casp, soy lecithinplus LPS, and Casp plus LPS. LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4,Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was dissolved in 0.9%NaCl and injected intraperitoneally at a dosage of 5 mg/kgb.wt. With this dosage, a medium-grade non-lethal systemicinflammation was intended to allow for detection of possiblebeneficial effects of co-administered drugs (Seemann and Lupp,2015, 2016; Seemann et al., 2017). Thus, no antibiotic treatmentor fluid resuscitation of the animals was necessary. Soy lecithinand Casp (kindly donated by Indena S.p.A., Milano, Italy)were given orally at a dosage of 80 mg/kg b.wt. (equivalent tothe proportion of soy lecithin in Casp) or 240 mg/kg b.wt.,respectively, 3 h before LPS challenge to ensure maximumplasma levels of boswellic acids at the time of LPS challenge(H\u00fcsch et al., 2013). Based on previous findings (Seemannet al., 2017), animals were sacrificed 24 h after LPS challengewhen plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are stillelevated and changes in immune cell distribution and liverfunction are already detectable. Twenty-four hours after LPStreatment, body temperature was measured and the mice\u2019s healthstatus was assessed by using the CSS described previously(Gonnert et al., 2011). Afterward, mice were sacrificed withan overdose of isoflurane, decapitated, and bled completely.Whole blood was collected in a tube (S Monovette R\u00a9 1.2 mlZ Clotting Activator/Serum, Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany)for clotting. Blood glucose levels were determined using adroplet of the whole blood with a commercially available bloodglucose meter and respective test strips (BG Star R\u00a9, Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany). After 30 min, clotted blood wascentrifuged at 2000 \u00d7 g for 10 min to obtain serum whichwas used for ELISA and enzymatic activity measurements.Additionally, brain, thymus, heart, lung, spleen, kidneys, liver,and adrenals were removed, weighed, and either fixed in 10%buffered formaldehyde or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen forbiochemical analysis. For histological analyses, formalin-fixedorgan samples were embedded in paraffin blocks (n = 8 animalsfor each treatment group).Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, Tumor NecrosisFactor (TNF)-\u03b1, and AlanineAminotransferase (ALAT) AssaysSerum levels of inflammatory and liver damage markerswere quantified with the following commercially availablereagents: mouse TNF-\u03b1 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems,Minneapolis, MN, United States), IL-6 Mouse ELISA Kit(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, United States), IL-10 MouseELISA Kit (Thermo Scientific), and EnzyChromTM AlanineTransaminase Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA,United States).Oxidative Status in the TissuesTo determine tissue content of GSH and GSSG, samples werehomogenized with 11 volumes of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer[5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); pH 8.0] and4 volumes of 25% metaphosphoric acid. After centrifugation(12,000 \u00d7 g, 4\u25e6C, 30 min), GSH was measured photometricallyin the supernatants (Ellman, 1959) and GSSG fluorometrically(Hissin and Hilf, 1976). To assess the tissue content of LPO asTBARS, tissue samples were homogenized with 19 volumes of ice-cold saline and analyzed fluorometrically, as previously described(Yagi, 1987).Liver Biotransformation CapacityBiotransformation capacity was assessed in the 9000 \u00d7 gsupernatants of the livers. To obtain 9000\u00d7 g supernatants, liversFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387123fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 4Loeser et al. Casperome R\u00a9 in Systemic Inflammationwere homogenized with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)(1:3, w/v) and subsequently centrifuged at 9000 \u00d7 g for 20 minat 4\u25e6C. The protein content of these fractions was determinedusing a modified Biuret method (Klinger and M\u00fcller, 1974). Fordetermination of CYP enzyme activities, the following modelreactions for different CYP isoforms were performed: ECOD[CYP1A, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2E (Aitio, 1978)], EROD [CYP1A (Pohland Fouts, 1980)], MROD [CYP1A2 (Lubet et al., 1985)], PROD[CYP2B (Lubet et al., 1985)], BROD [CYP2A, 2B, 2C, 3A (Lubetet al., 1985)], and EMND [CYP3A (Kleeberg and Klinger, 1982)].The amount of metabolite formed in these model reactions wasnormalized to the protein content of the respective 9000 \u00d7 gsupernatants and expressed as (pmol\u00d7mg protein\u22121 \u00d7min\u22121).Histopathology and ImmunohistochemistrySamples for histopathology and immunohistochemistry wereprepared by cutting 4-\u00b5m sections from the paraffin blocks andfloating these onto positively charged slides. Immunostainingwas performed by an indirect peroxidase-labeling method, asdescribed previously (Kaemmerer et al., 2017). Briefly, sectionswere de-waxed, microwaved in 10 mM citric acid (pH 6.0) for16 min at 600 W, and incubated with the respective primaryantibodies (Table 1) at 4\u25e6C overnight. Detection of the primaryantibodies was performed using either biotinylated goat anti-rabbit, horse anti-mouse or rabbit anti-goat IgGs, followedby incubation with peroxidase-conjugated avidin (VectorABC \u201cElite\u201d Kit, Vector, Burlingame, CA, United States).Binding of the primary antibody was visualized using3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) in acetate buffer (BioGenex,San Ramon, CA, United States). Sections were then rinsed,counterstained with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich,Steinheim, Germany), and mounted in VectaMountTMMounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,United States). All immunohistochemical stainings wereevaluated by two independent blinded investigators. To detectliver glycogen content, periodic-acid-Schiff staining (PAS;periodic acid, Schiff \u2019s reagent: Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,Germany) was performed, and to obtain a histological overview,hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) of livers and spleens wasconducted, using standard protocols (McManus, 1948; Fischeret al., 2008). Identification of the specific cell types was based ontheir microscopic features along with the relative location of thecells in the respective tissues.Cell Culture ExperimentsCellsPeripheral blood (Institute for Transfusion Medicine, JenaUniversity Hospital, Jena, Germany) was collected from healthyadult donors who had not taken any anti-inflammatory drugsduring the last 10 days. The protocols for experiments withhuman monocytes were approved by the ethical committeeof the Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany, onMarch 19, 2014; approval number: 4025-02/14. All methodswere performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines andregulations. Leukocyte concentrates were centrifuged (4000 \u00d7 g,20 min, 20\u25e6C) and PBMCs were freshly isolated by dextransedimentation and centrifugation on lymphocyte separationmedium (Histopaque R\u00a9-1077, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,Germany). Resulting PBMCs were seeded in RPMI 1640(Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) supplemented with 10%heat inactivated FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mlstreptomycin in cell culture flasks (Greiner Bio-one, Nuertingen,Germany) for 1\u20131.5 h at 37\u25e6C, 5% CO2. Adherent monocyteswere washed twice with PBS and finally harvested by cellscraping.Cytokine MeasurementIn order to determine the effect of Casp on cytokine release,1.5 \u00d7 106 monocytes/ml in RPMI 1640 (supplemented with5% heat inactivated FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mlstreptomycin) were pre-incubated for 30 min with vehicle(0.2% DMSO) or 30 \u00b5g/ml Casp after allowing for monocyteadhesion for 1.5 h at 37\u25e6C and 5% CO2. Cells were stimulatedwith 10 ng/ml LPS for distinct intervals (TNF-\u03b1, IL-8: 4 h;IL-6, IL-10: 18 h), and cytokines released into the mediumwere measured using specific Quantikine ELISA Kits (R&DSystems, Minneapolis, MN, United States). The glucocorticoiddexamethasone (1\u00b5M; Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) wasused as positive control.MTT AssayTo exclude cytotoxic effects of Casp, monocytes were dilutedto 2 \u00d7 106/ml in RPMI 1640 (containing 5% heat inactivatedFCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin) andseeded in a 96-well plate. Monocytes were allowed to adherefor 1.5 h at 37\u25e6C and 5% CO2 prior to treatment with vehicle(0.5% DMSO) or extract (30 \u00b5g/ml) in 100 \u00b5l of mediumfor 24 h. Afterward, cells were incubated with thiazolyl bluetetrazolium bromide solution (MTT, 5 mg/ml PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) until blue staining of the control.Formazan formation was stopped by adding 100 \u00b5l SDS-lysisbuffer (10%, w/v in 20 mM HCl, pH 4.5) and the well plateswere shaken at room temperature overnight. Finally, absorbancewas measured at 570 nm with a MultiskanTM microplatespectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Ulm, Germany). Thepan-protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (1 \u00b5M; Calbiochem,La Jolla, CA, United States) was used as positive (cytotoxic)control.Statistical AnalysisFor statistical analysis, the IBM SPSS statistics program (version22.0) was used. In all cases, animal experiments were performedwith eight mice per treatment group. Statistical significance wasdetermined by using the non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test,followed by the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test with Holm\u2013Bonferronicorrection.

Twenty-four hours after treatment, the health statusof LPS-challenged mice was distinctly impaired (Figure 1A).Additionally, body temperature was significantly decreased byan average of 2.6\u25e6C (mean control value: 37.2\u25e6C). Blood glucoselevels were even diminished by more than 50% when comparedwith control animals (Figures 1B,C). In all cases, Casp was able tosignificantly ameliorate LPS-induced effects, whereas soy lecithin(solvent control, devoid of frankincense) showed no protectiveimpact. Mice receiving soy lecithin or Casp alone displayed norelevant differences to the control group.In comparison to controls, LPS challenge caused an averagedecrease in b.wt. by 14% (Figure 1D) and in liver and thymusweights by 12 and 25%, respectively, whereas spleen and adrenalweights were increased by 23% (Figures 1E,F). Weights of brain,kidney, and heart, in contrast, remained unaffected (data notshown). Treatment with soy lecithin or Casp alone caused adecrease in spleen weights by 15 and 22% (p = 0.071; p = 0.007)and in thymus weights by 21 and 29% (p = 0.066; p = 0.016),respectively (Figure 1E), with no overt histological changes inthese organs. While administration of soy lecithin had no effecton LPS-mediated changes in body and organ weights, Casp wasable to significantly return the LPS-induced increase in spleenand adrenal weights to control values (Figures 1E,F). Thymusweights, in contrast, remained significantly reduced not only byadditional soy lecithin treatment, but also by co-administrationof Casp by 39 and 34% (p = 0.006; p = 0.007), respectively, whichwas not statistically different from the weight reduction observedafter sole LPS treatment (p = 0.167; p = 0.264; data not shown).Serum Cytokine and ALAT LevelsTo evaluate the impact of Casp on LPS-induced alterations incirculating cytokine levels, serum concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 as well as of theanti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured at sacrifice(Figures 2A\u2013C). Compared to control animals, administration ofLPS caused an elevation of serum TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 valuesby about 120, 670, and 70%, respectively, whereas sole treatmentwith soy lecithin or Casp had no effect. Co-administration ofCasp was able to reduce the LPS-induced increase in serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels by about 30 and 50%, respectively, whereas IL-10values were slightly further elevated. Co-administration of soylecithin, in contrast, had no influence on LPS effects.As a parameter indicating liver damage, serum ALAT levelswere determined (Figure 2D). Here, LPS treatment caused adistinct increase by about 140% compared to controls. Sole soylecithin or Casp administration, in contrast, had no influenceon serum ALAT concentration and no effect of soy lecithin co-treatment on LPS-induced liver damage was noted. In contrast,after co-administration of Casp significantly lower ALAT valueswere observed compared to LPS-only-treated mice.Oxidative Stress in Different OrgansSince oxidative stress plays a major role in systemic inflammation,the impact of Casp on LPS-induced changes in the oxidativestatus was evaluated in different organs. For this purpose, tissuelevels of lipid peroxidation products as well as the tissue contentof GSH and GSSG were determined. After LPS challenge, tissuecontent of lipid peroxidation products was increased by 12,20, 24, 45, 60, and 170% in brain, heart, lung, spleen, kidney,and liver, respectively, suggesting considerably elevated oxidativestress in these organs (Figures 3A\u2013E). Soy lecithin administrationalone caused a decrease in LPO levels only in liver by about 30%,compared to control levels. Similarly, only in heart LPO weredecreased by about 20% after sole Casp treatment. Comparedto LPS-only-treated animals, combined soy lecithin and LPSadministration reduced LPO levels in lung, heart, and spleen,but increased the values in liver. In contrast, co-treatment withCasp significantly attenuated LPS-mediated elevation of LPOtoward control in all organs investigated, thus indicating anoticeable additional antioxidant capacity of Boswellia serrataextract (Figures 3A\u2013E). Regarding glutathione status, increasesin GSH, GSSG, and total glutathione concentrations by about 10,20, and 60% were noticed in kidney, lung, and spleen after LPStreatment (Figure 3F), respectively, while liver levels decreasedby 10% (representing the primary organ of glutathione synthesis;data not shown). There was, however, no major change in theGSH/GSSG ratio in all tissues. In brain and heart, no influence ofLPS administration on glutathione concentrations was observed.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387125fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 6Loeser et al.

In all other organs no relevant significantimpact of either soy lecithin or Casp on LPS-mediated effects ontissue glutathione levels was observed.Spleen: Apoptosis, Immune CellRedistribution, and TNF-\u03b1 ExpressionSince apoptotic processes are of substantial importance in thecourse of systemic inflammation and spleen function is crucialfor the removal of damaged red and white blood cells and ofbacteria from the blood stream, cleaved caspase-3 expressionwas assessed in spleens by means of immunohistochemistryas a marker of apoptotic processes. Examination of spleensfrom LPS-only-treated mice revealed a markedly enhancedexpression of cleaved caspase-3, especially in the white pulp,compared to controls and to soy lecithin R\u00a9- or Casp-only-treated animals (Figures 4A,B). Besides being increasinglypresent in spleno- and lymphocytes, strong immunostainingwas noticed especially in tingible body macrophages, whichwere much more frequently present in the white pulp ofspleens from LPS-challenged mice than in the other treatmentgroups (arrowheads in Figure 4B).

Incontrol animals and in soy lecithin- or Casp-only-treatedmice, CD3+ cells were abundantly present in the periarteriolarsheaths of the white pulp (Figure 4D). In contrast, after LPSchallenge the splenic tissue was nearly devoid of CD3+ cells(Figure 4E). This effect was partially reversed after co-treatmentwith Casp (Figure 4F), but not with soy lecithin, indicating aspecific immunomodulatory action of the frankincense extract.In contrast to the massive emigration of CD3+ positive cellsfrom the splenic tissue after LPS administration, a considerableimmigration of CD68+ cells was detected in spleens after LPStreatment of the animals when compared to controls or to soylecithin- or Casp-only-treated mice (Figures 4G,H). Thesecells were mainly observed in the red pulp, but an increasedinfiltration of CD68+ cells was also noticed in the whitepulp. Again, this effect was nearly completely reversed afterco-administration of Casp, but not of soy lecithin (Figure 4I).Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 is mainly secreted by macrophages.Due to the massive immigration of CD68+ cells into the spleensafter LPS treatment, TNF-\u03b1 expression was additionally assessedin spleen tissue by immunohistochemistry. These investigationsrevealed TNF-\u03b1 expression patterns, which were very similarto those seen in the CD68 immunostaining: In comparisonto control or to soy lecithin- or Casp-only treatment, LPS-challenge caused a massive immigration of TNF-\u03b1-positive cellsinto the splenic tissue, which was almost completely abolishedby co-treatment of the mice with Casp (Figures 5A\u2013C), whereasco-administration of soy lecithin showed no effect.Not only LPS, but also pro-inflammatory cytokines suchas TNF-\u03b1 are known to induce iNOS expression in immunecells such as neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages via theNF\u03baB pathway. Besides giving rise to cytotoxic peroxynitrite,excess NO production is critically involved in the course ofsystemic inflammation, since it contributes to hypotension,cardiodepression, vascular hyporeactivity, and ultimately septicshock.

Following LPStreatment, a massive immigration of iNOS-positive neutrophils(and occasionally also of macrophages) was detected in the redand occasionally also in the white pulp of the spleens fromLPS-only-treated animals in comparison to control and soylecithin- or Casp-only-treated mice (Figures 5D,E). Also here,co-administration of Casp, but not of soy lecithin, distinctlyameliorated this effect (Figure 5F).Liver: Immune Cell Immigration,Glycogen Content, andBiotransformation CapacityIn parallel to the investigations in the spleens, immunostainingsfor different immune cell markers and for TNF-\u03b1 and iNOSwere also performed in the livers. Here, in contrast to thespleens, an increased presence of CD3+ T-lymphocytes wasobserved after LPS treatment of the animals (Figures 6A,B).Additionally, liver expression of the macrophage markerF4/80 was distinctly higher in LPS-challenged mice incomparison to controls, soy lecithin- or Casp-only-treatedanimals (Figures 6D,E). Likewise, TNF-\u03b1 expression wasstrongly enhanced in monocytes/macrophages and alsoin sinusoidal endothelial cells after LPS administration(Figures 7D,E). Additionally, and as in the spleens, LPSchallenge yielded a massive appearance of iNOS-positiveneutrophils in the livers (Figures 7A,B). All these effects weresignificantly less pronounced after pre-administration of Casp(Figures 6C,F, 7C,F), whereas soy lecithin had no impact onLPS-induced changes.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387128fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 9Loeser et al.

In comparison to livers from control, soy lecithin- orCasp-only-treated mice, LPS-challenge caused almost completeglycogen depletion. This effect was partially reversed byadditional administration of Casp but not of soy lecithin(Figures 7G\u2013I).Biotransformation capacity was evaluated by assessing theexpression levels of three different CYP isoforms and bymeasuring CYP-dependent monooxygenase activities by meansof specific model reactions. All three CYP isoforms (CYP1A1,CYP2B1, and CYP3A2) assessed were predominantly expressedin the hepatocytes located around the central veins (Figure 8).In comparison to controls and soy lecithin-only-treated mice,LPS administration produced a strong reduction in CYPisoforms expression. In Casp-only-treated animals, in contrast,a strong increase in CYP expression was observed, whichwas most clearly visible in the pericentral regions of theliver lobules. Whereas co-administration of soy lecithin didnot show any visible influence on LPS-mediated effects,additional treatment with Casp was able to restore CYPexpression levels completely (Figure 8). Also in the CYPmodel reactions a distinct decrease in enzyme activitieswas observed after LPS administration in comparison tocontrols (Figure 9). In contrast, after sole soy lecithin andespecially after sole Casp treatment distinct increases in CYPactivities were observed, suggesting a noticeable CYP-inducingcapacity of Casp (Figure 9). Whereas additional soy lecithintreatment in some instances slightly ameliorated the LPSeffects, biotransformation capacity was completely restored backto control values after supplementary Casp administration(Figure 9).Effects of Casperome R\u00a9 in Human PrimaryMonocytesIn order to investigate anti-inflammatory effects of Casp ina human in vitro model, the influence of the extract onLPS-induced cytokine release from human monocytes wasFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387129fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 10Loeser et al.

At aconcentration of 30 \u00b5g/ml, Casp decreased the levels of allpro-inflammatory cytokines measured. Thus, TNF-\u03b1 release wasreduced by 32% with similar efficiency as for dexamethasone(30% reduction). Even stronger effects of Casp were detectedfor release of IL-6 and the chemokine IL-8 (Figure 10A).Additionally, Casp and dexamethasone blocked the releaseof the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. To exclude anycytotoxicity being responsible for diminished cytokine release,Casp was evaluated in a cell viability (MTT) assay. As shownin Figure 10B, 30 \u00b5g/ml Casp produced no detrimental impacton monocyte viability after 24 h incubation in comparisonto control, whereas staurosporine reduced cell viability toabout 54% of control values. Thus, these data supportCasp as a potent anti-inflammatory agent without cytotoxiceffects.DISCUSSIONSince the beneficial effects of frankincense in the treatmentof chronic inflammatory diseases have already been welldocumented (see e.g., Poeckel and Werz, 2006; Moussaieff andMechoulam, 2009; Abdel-Tawab et al., 2011; Du et al., 2015), theaim of the present study was to assess possible protective effectsof frankincense on acute systemic inflammation for the first time.Because of the well-documented influence of the boswellic acidson cytokine production by monocytes/macrophages (Syrovetset al., 2000; Pandey et al., 2005; Gayathri et al., 2007; Sharmaet al., 2016), we focused on cytokine plasma levels, immunecell redistribution, and oxidative stress as well as liver function.The latter parameter is known to be critical for overall patientoutcome during systemic inflammation and has been shown to benegatively influenced by pro-inflammatory cytokines (Morgan,2001; Novotny et al., 2007; Jacob et al., 2009; Nesseler et al., 2012).After LPS challenge, reduced b.wt. of the animals, decreasedblood glucose levels, and almost complete glycogen depletion ofFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387131fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 12Loeser et al.

Immunohistochemistry (red\u2013brown color), counterstaining with hematoxylin; original magnification: \u00d7400. CYP expression was mainly confined tothe hepatocytes around the central veins (asterisks).the livers were observed, which is in line with literature data(Raetzsch et al., 2009; Santos et al., 2013; Seemann and Lupp,2015, 2016; Seemann et al., 2017). On the one hand, these effectscould be explained by the distinctly reduced health status ofthe animals, mirrored by low CSS scores, which may have ledto reduced food intake. On the other hand, it has been shownthat (partially mediated via increased TNF-\u03b1 expression) LPSis able to reduce gluconeogenesis (Goto et al., 2001; Raetzschet al., 2009; Santos et al., 2013) and to increase glycogenolysis(Casteleijn et al., 1988). Presumably by direct binding of theboswellic acids to LPS and thus blunting TLR4, MyD88, andNF\u03baB signaling (and, consequently, TNF-\u03b1 release and COX-2induction), but probably also by a direct interaction with NF\u03baBand COX-2, co-administration of Casp significantly increasedblood glucose values and liver glycogen content compared tothe LPS-only treatment group. Additionally, general health statusof the animals was significantly improved after co-treatmentwith Casp with increased food consumption, lower levels ofcirculating pro-inflammatory cytokines, a lower severity ofthe inflammatory processes, and a normalization of the bodytemperatures, compared to the LPS-only-treated animals.In the present investigation, markedly increased serumlevels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 wereobserved in LPS-treated animals, as expected from literature data(Seemann and Lupp, 2015, 2016; Seemann et al., 2017). Theseincreased levels were distinctly reduced after Casp co-treatmentof the mice. Thus, the reported suppression of pro-inflammatorycytokine release from monocytes/macrophages by boswellicacids (Syrovets et al., 2000; Pandey et al., 2005; Gayathriet al., 2007; Sharma et al., 2016) could be reproduced alsowith the frankincense extract Casp in vivo in acute systemicinflammation. These results were further confirmed by cell-based assays using human primary monocytes, which revealeda distinct reduction of the LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8release after Casp treatment. In contrast to the suppressiveeffects on pro-inflammatory cytokines, murine serum levels ofthe anti-inflammatory IL-10 were slightly enhanced by Caspco-treatment, whereas in the cell-based assay IL-10 release wasFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387132fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 13Loeser et al.

This discrepancy may be due to the fact thatin vivo IL-10 is not only released by monocytes/macrophagesbut also by many other immune cells such as TH2- or Treg-lymphocytes. IL-10 released from these cells has a central role inlimiting immune responses to pathogens to protect the organismfrom damage due to exaggerated inflammatory processes (Saraivaand O\u2019Garra, 2010). Thus, in addition to the inhibitory effectsseen on cytokine production by monocytes and macrophages,stimulation of IL-10 release from these other immune cells mayhave also contributed to the overall better outcome observed afterco-treatment with Casp, compared to LPS-only-treated mice.In parallel to the influence of Casp on pro-inflammatoryand anti-inflammatory cytokines, also immune cell redistributionwas distinctly reduced by the frankincense extract. In spleens,LPS caused a massive appearance of iNOS-positive neutrophilsand of CD68/iNOS/TNF-\u03b1-positive monocytes/macrophages,but a depletion of CD3+ T-lymphocytes, whereas in liversimmigration of iNOS positive neutrophils as well as CD3+cells was observed. All these effects were distinctly amelioratedafter co-administration of Casp. Especially the influence oniNOS expression may be of importance, since increased iNOSexpression and, most importantly, immigration of iNOS-positiveFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387133fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 14Loeser et al. Casperome R\u00a9 in Systemic InflammationFIGURE 10 | Effect of Casp on cytokine release and cytotoxicity in human monocytes. (A) Human primary monocytes were pre-incubated with vehicle orcompounds (Casp; dexamethasone, dex) for 30 min prior to stimulation with LPS for 4 (TNF-\u03b1, IL-8) or 18 h (IL-6, IL-10). Formed cytokines were measured byELISA. Data are means \u00b1 SEM; n = 3; \u2217\u2217\u2217p < 0.001; \u2217\u2217p < 0.01; \u2217p < 0.05; inhibitor vs. stimulated control (100%), one-way ANOVA plus Bonferroni test. (B) Effectof Casp on cell viability. Intact human monocytes were incubated with compounds (Casp; staurosporine, stsp) or vehicle for 24 h and cell viability was analyzed byMTT assay.

Finally,in parallel to the positive influence on TNF-\u03b1 serum values,Casp was also able to ameliorate LPS-induced increases inTNF-\u03b1 expression by monocytes/macrophages and sinusoidalendothelial cells in liver tissue.In contrast to average b.wt., spleen weights were distinctlyenhanced after LPS treatment. The occurrence of splenomegalyin response to severe systemic inflammation has been shownalso in humans (Arismendi-Morillo et al., 2004) and has beencorrelated with, among others, TNF-\u03b1- and IL-6-mediatedelevation of serum high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) levelsin spleen tissue (Vald\u00e9s-Ferrer et al., 2013). The increase involume has been demonstrated for both red and white pulpand has been shown to be due to hyperemia and enhancedimmigration of white blood cells into the splenic tissue, especiallyneutrophils and macrophages (Vald\u00e9s-Ferrer et al., 2013;Seemann et al., 2017). As mentioned above, an increased presenceof iNOS-positive neutrophils and CD68/iNOS/TNF-\u03b1-positivemonocytes/macrophages was observed in the spleens after LPSchallenge also in the present investigation. Additionally, a distinctrise in apoptotic processes was also noted, demonstrated byincreased cleaved caspase-3 stainings, and mirrored by increasedpresence of tingible body macrophages in spleens after LPStreatment. Probably, there is an increased need for degradationof nonfunctional erythrocytes and white blood cells as a resultof systemic inflammation. In contrast to these processes, massiveemigration of CD3+ T-lymphocytes from spleens was observedafter LPS challenge, which is in line with previous investigations(Vald\u00e9s-Ferrer et al., 2013; Seemann et al., 2017). Since thepresent investigation demonstrated increased immigration ofCD3+ cells into liver tissue, these cells may leave the spleento enter other organs in response to systemic inflammation.Probably by suppressing increased levels of pro-inflammatorycytokines, spleen weights were significantly decreased back tonormal values after co-administration of Casp. Additionally,less neutrophils and macrophages were present in spleen tissuewhile apoptotic processes as well as presence of tingible bodymacrophages were distinctly reduced in comparison to LPS-only-treated animals. Furthermore, emigration of CD3+ cells fromspleen into other organs was significantly attenuated, suggesting anoticeable immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory action ofthe frankincense extract.Lipopolysaccharides-only-treated animals also showedadrenal hypertrophy, which may be explained by activation ofthe hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenocortical axis in response tothe inflammatory event (Prigent et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2007;Zhang et al., 2014), but also by stimulation of adrenal medullarycatecholamine synthesis to stabilize cardiovascular function(Flierl et al., 2008). Probably by decreasing pro-inflammatoryFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387134fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 15Loeser et al. Casperome R\u00a9 in Systemic Inflammationcytokine levels, thus exerting anti-inflammatory effects, Caspwas evidently able to counteract these effects, since adrenalweights were significantly returned back to normal values in ourinvestigation.In contrast to spleen and adrenals, thymus weights weredistinctly reduced after LPS treatment. As in spleen, this effectmay be due to a massive emigration of T-lymphocytes into otherorgans, but also to increased apoptotic processes as has beenshown in other sepsis animal experiments before (Hiramatsuet al., 1997, Seemann and Lupp, 2015). There was, however, alsoa comparable decrease in thymus weights and also a reductionin spleen weights after sole soy lecithin or Casp treatment. Theseeffects remain unclear since no overt histological changes werenoticed in the histological stainings of both organs after solesoy lecithin or Casp administration. The effects of Casp on theweights of these two immune organs could be, however, anexpression of the known immunomodulatory properties of theboswellic acids (see e.g., Poeckel and Werz, 2006; Moussaieffand Mechoulam, 2009; Abdel-Tawab et al., 2011; St\u00fcrner et al.,2017), which in our mouse model evidently helped the animals tobetter cope with the LPS-induced systemic inflammation. Aftercombined treatment with LPS, clear-cut protective effects wereseen on all parameters tested, including spleen weights, plasmalevels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and immune cellredistribution, and there was no additional negative influence onthymus weights. Nevertheless, in future experiments, the effectsof Casp (but also of soy lecithin) on the immune system insystemic inflammation should be elaborated in more detail inorder to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the protectivefindings of the present investigation more precisely and toexclude any adverse effects.Lipopolysaccharides can lead to enhanced generation ofreactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), both directlyand via increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. ROS arethe result of elevated NADPH-oxidase expression in neutrophilsand monocytes/macrophages after LPS challenge (Kim et al.,2007), but may also be caused by increased mitochondrial leakage(Shoji et al., 1995; Galley, 2011). RNSs are generated both viaenhanced NADPH-oxidase and iNOS expression in neutrophilsand monocytes/macrophages. ROS/RNS are neutralized, amongothers, by the glutathione system, which represents an importantanti-oxidative mechanism of the body to protect cellularmacromolecules such as DNA, lipids, and proteins from chemicaldamage and degradation (Hayes and McLellan, 1999). In thepresent investigation, a distinct decrease in glutathione contentin livers was observed after LPS treatment of the animals. Thisglutathione loss may either be caused by LPS-induced livercell damage, as indicated by increased serum ALAT values,and subsequent impairment of glutathione synthesis, but mayalso be caused by intensified export to other organs, such askidneys, lungs, and spleens. This latter hypothesis is supportedby the observation that in these organs, and in contrast toliver, an increase in glutathione content was observed afterLPS treatment. Lipid peroxidation products are the result ofexcessive oxidative stress which has overwhelmed the overallanti-oxidative capacity of the body and has led to a degradation ofmembrane lipids (Ayala et al., 2014). In the present investigation,corresponding to elevated ALAT values, a strong increasein lipid peroxidation products was seen especially in liversafter LPS treatment, but also in all other organs tested. Caspcaused a marked reduction in hepatic LPO content when givenin addition to LPS, presumably by direct binding to LPS,thereby preventing increased expression of NADPH-oxidase,iNOS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but probably also dueto a direct radical scavenging capacity (Afsar et al., 2012; Al-Harrasi et al., 2013). In all other organs investigated, levels wereeven reverted back to normal values. Altogether, these effectssuggest a noticeable anti-oxidative capacity of the frankincenseextract.Biotransformation capacity is of essential importance for thedetoxification and elimination of endogenous substances, as wellas exogenously administered therapies, and the CYP systemrepresents one of the key enzyme systems involved in phase Imetabolism of xenobiotics (Nebert and Russell, 2002). It is wellknown from the literature that the pro-inflammatory cytokinesTNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, interferon-\u03b1, and interferon-\u03b3, as well as NOcause a strong downregulation especially of the CYP system butalso of other biotransformation enzymes (Morgan, 2001; Aitkenet al., 2006). Consequently, in sepsis patients CYP-mediated drugmetabolism is markedly impaired (Carcillo et al., 2003; Jacobet al., 2009). Since sepsis patients usually are concomitantlytreated with several drugs, such as, e.g., antibiotics, reduction inCYP activity may lead to an accumulation of these substancesand enhanced side effects of these multiple medications, whichmay have additional negative impact on the health status ofthese patients (Carcillo et al., 2003). In the present investigation,Casp turned out to be a strong inducer of all CYP enzymestested. Since no other comparable in vivo data are available sofar for either the frankincense extract or individual boswellicacids, this effect remains to be further elucidated. In the onlyin vitro study performed so far on liver microsomes, an inhibitoryaction of frankincense extract and various boswellic acids ondifferent CYP enzymes has been shown (Frank and Unger, 2006).However, in vitro experiments using microsomes do not allow forprediction of potential drug effects as CYP inducer or inhibitorin vivo beyond a mere interaction, since for CYP inductionintact cells are required. Based on the CYP-inducing capacity andthe decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO, wepostulate that Casp may be able to restore both CYP enzymesexpression and activities back to normal values, which wouldsuggest a therapeutic use of frankincense extract in the treatmentof sepsis patients.Besides the distinct beneficial effects of Casp on most ofthe parameters tested, in some instances a significant protectiveinfluence on LPS-mediated changes was also observed withthe phospholipid soy lecithin. Thus, soy lecithin was ableto cause a slight reduction in elevated LPO levels in lungs,hearts, and spleens and an improvement of CYP-mediatedbiotransformation capacity in some of the model reactions.However, in all these cases, the effect of Casp (i.e., thecombination of soy lecithin and frankincense extract) exceededthat of soy lecithin alone. Protective effects of phospholipid-rich lipid solutions in sepsis have been reported both inhumans and in animal experiments (Read et al., 1995;Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387135fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 16Loeser et al. Casperome R\u00a9 in Systemic InflammationGoldfarb et al., 2003; Gordon et al., 2005). The exact mechanismunderlying these effects still remains to be elucidated. However,an increased binding of LPS by lipoproteins generated from theselipids and thus prevention of interaction of the LPS/LPS-bindingprotein complex with Toll-like receptors has been suggested(Read et al., 1995; Goldfarb et al., 2003; Gordon et al., 2005).CONCLUSIONIn summary, the present investigation shows for the first timethat the orally bioavailable frankincense extract Casp is able toprevent acute LPS-induced systemic inflammation in mice byexerting anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and hepatoprotectiveeffects. Casp may therefore serve as a new prophylacticallyacting supportive treatment option in systemic inflammatoryconditions, especially when accompanied by impaired liverfunction. It would be of further interest to determine whetherCasp also exerts protective effects when given later in the courseof the disease and/or using other sepsis models. Additionally,individual boswellic acids should be tested to find out, which ofthe different components of frankincense extract may indeed beresponsible for the beneficial effects of Casp in acute systemicinflammation.AVAILABILITY OF DATA AND MATERIALSThe materials used and raw data supporting the conclusions ofthe present manuscript will be available from the correspondingauthor without undue reservation on reasonable request to anyqualified researcher.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSKL, OW, and AL conceived and designed the experiments.MA-T and OW provided the compounds.

The urgent need for novel antimycotics called particular attention to thestudy of natural products. The genus Hypericum includes many species that are usedin the traditional medicine to treat pathological states like inflammations and infectionscaused by fungi. However, despite the diffused use of Hypericum-based products theantifungal potential of the genus is still poorly investigated. In this study five Hypericumspecies autochthonous of Central and Eastern Europe were evaluated regarding theirpolyphenolic content, their toxicological safety and their antifungal potential against abroad panel of clinical fungal isolates. LC-MS analysis led to the identification andquantification of 52 compounds, revealing that Hypericum extracts are rich sourcesof flavonols, benzoates and cinnamates, and of flavan-3-ols. An in-depth screen ofthe biological activity of crude extracts clearly unveiled H. hircinum subsp. majus as apromising candidate species for the search of novel antifungals. H. hircinum is diffusedin the Mediterranean basin from Spain to Turkey where it is traditionally used to prepare aherbal tea indicated for the treatment of respiratory tract disorders, several of which arecaused by fungi. Noteworthy, the infusion of H. hircinum subsp. majus excreted broadantifungal activity against Penicillium, Aspergillus and non-albicans Candida isolatescomprising strains both sensitive and resistant to fluconazole. Additionally, it showedno cytotoxicity on human cells and the chemical characterization of the H. hircinumsubsp. majus infusion revealed high amounts of the metabolite hyperoside. These resultsscientifically support the traditional use of H. hircinum extracts for the treatment ofrespiratory tract infections and suggest the presence of exploitable antifungal principlesfor further investigations aimed at developing novel antifungal therapies.Keywords: Hypericum, antifungal, Candida, cytotoxicity, LC-MS, phenolic compoundsAbbreviations: CFU, colony forming units; GM, geometric mean; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 382139fphar-09-00382 April 20, 2018 Time: 12:10 # 2Tocci et al. Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal ExtractsINTRODUCTIONThe rising incidence of fungal infections is an emerging serioushealth problem, especially in cases of immune compromisedpatients caused either by diseases like AIDS, or by cancertherapies and prolonged antibiotic treatments (Lass-Fl\u00f6rl, 2009;Weil et al., 2017). Estimates of global mortality rates suggest thatfungi are responsible for more deaths than either tuberculosisor malaria (Brown et al., 2012). Millions more suffer fromsevere illness caused by chronic or allergic fungal infections.Candidiasis is the most prevalent fungal disease worldwidedifficult and extremely costly to treat (World Health Organization[WHO], 2014). The available antifungal drugs like polyenes,pyrimidines, azoles, and echinocandins often provoke significanttoxicity including fever, nausea and vomiting, dose-limitingnephrotoxicity, liver toxicity, and controversial interactions withco-administered drugs (Dismukes, 2000; Zager, 2000). Anothercrucial problem is represented by the increasing rate of drugresistance that invalidates the clinical treatments. The alarminggap in the anti-fungal pipeline makes the discovery of newactive compounds a priority for the scientific community. Thestrong request of new classes of compounds has renewedthe interest in the screening of natural products (Abreuet al., 2012; Atanasov et al., 2016). Especially, ethnobotanyrepresents an important guide in the search of novel antifungalagents. Due to their ability to synthesize a limitless varietyof chemical structures, plants have represented a source ofbioactive remedies for centuries (Arif et al., 2009). Despite ofthis, it is estimated that only a small proportion of plantsare used by humans. Therefore, bioactivity screening programsand research on new plant-derived compounds are of primeimportance for the search of novel leads. Plants belongingto the genus Hypericum, are characteristic components of theEuropean flora. In particular, Europe and the Mediterraneanbasin represent a hot spot of diversity for Hypericum species(N\u00fcrk and Crockett, 2011). The best characterized species isH. perforatum L., which was already described by Hippocratesas a remedy against possession in the Ancient Greece (Dugouaet al., 2006). During the centuries it has been used forthe treatment of various pathological states, like neurologicaldisorders, wounds, inflammations, and infections. The useof H. perforatum extracts is so popular that this species isconsidered the most important medicinal plant of the 20thcentury (Gurib-Fakim, 2006). The German Commission Eapproved its usage for several indications, including treatmentand post-therapy of acute and contused injuries, myalgia andfirst-degree burns as well as dyspeptic complaints (Arsic et al.,2010). In the Balkan Countries it is considered as one ofthe oldest remedies and in the Serbian folk medicine it isindicated for the treatment of cuts, burns, hemorrhoids andalso as an antiseptic, for liver and stomach complaints, diarrhea,and gastric ulcers. Its sale represents a huge part of theoverall herbal market (Crockett et al., 2011), exceeding $570million/annum worldwide (Ayan et al., 2006). Regarding itsantifungal potential, inhibitory properties against Candida spp.,(Tocci et al., 2013) and fungal plant pathogens (Crockett et al.,2011) have been reported. Nevertheless, a growing number ofscientific evidences underlines the importance to investigateother Hypericum species that might exert a more promisingantifungal activity (Radulovic\u00b4 et al., 2007; Stojanovic et al., 2013).In this regard the species H. carinatum, H. myrianthum, H.linoides (Barros et al., 2013), H. garciae (Tocci et al., 2018a) havebeen shown to have the potential to inhibit the growth of Candidaspp. Cryptococcus neoformans and Rhodotorula mucilaginosagrowth.In Central and Eastern Europe several different Hypericumspecies co-occur and the area is considered a significant source ofplant material for the market of herbal products (Raclariu et al.,2017).Amongst others, H. maculatum Crantz subsp. maculatum,H. hircinum L. s. lat., H. hirsutum L., and H. montanumL., as plants used to treat wounds, skin inflammations andburns (Menkovic et al., 2011), as well as infections of therespiratory (Sagratini et al., 2008) and urinary tract (Saric\u00b4-Kundalic\u00b4 et al., 2010). These pathologies are often causedby fungi, with Candida as the main causative agent and bydermatophytes in the case of external infections (Borgers et al.,2005; Johnson, 2012; Ritchie and Eltahawy, 2014). To screen fornew candidates suitable for the development of novel antimycoticsolutions, we studied extracts deriving from the aerial partsof several Hypericum taxa (H. perforatum L., H. maculatumCrantz subsp. maculatum, H. hircinum L. s.lat., H. hirsutum L.,and H. montanum L.) with respect to their chemical profile,their antifungal activity against a broad panel of clinical fungalisolates of the human gut and their toxicological safety onhuman skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs).MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant MaterialSamples of H. hirsutum subsp. hirsutum, H. hircinum subsp.majus, H. maculatum, H. montanum, and H. perforatumhave been collected during spring-summer of 2015 in theAlpine region (Northern-Eastern Italy). Species were identifiedaccording to the most recent Flora of Italy (Pignatti, 1982,2017), nomenclature follows Bartolucci et al. (2018) andtype specimens were deposited in the Department of FoodQuality and Nutrition at the Fondazione Edmund Machin San Michele all\u2019Adige, Trento, Italy (Reference number:NT0001 H. perforatum, NT0002 H. montanum, NT0003H. maculatum, NT0004 H. hirsutum, NT0005 H. hircinum subsp.majus).Preparation of Crude Plant ExtractsFor each species, 500 mg of dried plant biomass, representedby stems and leaves, were powdered by grinding and extractedin the dark with methanol (drug/solvent ratio = 1:20 w/v) bymaceration (3 \u00d7 24 h). H. hircinum subsp. majus was alsosubjected to extractions with boiling water (100\u25e6C) for 20 min,and ethanol 80% by maceration for 24 h. The obtained extractswere evaporated to dryness, weighed and stored at \u221220\u25e6C untilanalysis.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 382140fphar-09-00382 April 20, 2018 Time: 12:10 # 3Tocci et al. Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal ExtractsPreparation of Samples for ChemicalAnalysisPrior to analysis methanolic extracts were resuspended in50% methanol/water and filtered using sterile (0.2 \u00b5m) PTFEfilters.LC-MS AnalysisAnalysis of phenolic metabolites was performed using aWaters Acquity UPLC system (Milford, MA, United States)which consists of a binary pump, an online vacuum degasser,an autosampler and a column compartment as previouslydescribed (Vrhovsek et al., 2012). Phenolic compounds wereseparated at a temperature of 40\u25e6C on a Waters AcquityHSS T3 column 1.8 \u00b5m, 150 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm (Milford,MA, United States). The mobile phase was composed ofcomponent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and component B(0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Acetonitrile was of LC-MSgrade and was purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,United States). Pure standards of hypericin from Hypericumperforatum \u223c95% (HPLC), hyperoside and hyperforin werepurchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States).Milli-Q water was used for the chromatography. The flowwas set to 0.4 mL/min, and the gradient profile was: 0 min,5% B; from 0 to 3 min, linear gradient to 20% B; from3 to 4.3 min, isocratic 20% B; from 4.3 to 9 min, lineargradient to 45% B; from 9 to 11 min, linear gradient to100% B; from 11 to 13 min, wash at 100% B; from 13.01to 15 min, the re-equilibrated to the initial conditions of5% B. Analysis of hypericin, hyperforin and hyperoside wasperformed using the same Waters Acquity UPLC system(Milford, MA, United States) and conditions, by means of adifferent gradient. The gradient profile in this case was: 0 min,10% B; from 0 to 4,5 min, linear gradient to 100% B; from4,5 to 12 min, isocratic 100% B; finally the column was re-equilibrated to the initial conditions of 10% B for 4 min.MRM transitions for hypericin, hyperforin and hyperoside arereported in Supplementary Table S1. Each sample was analyzedin triplicate. Samples were kept at 6\u25e6C during the analysis. Massspectrometry detection for both methods was performed on aWaters Xevo TQMS (Milford, MA, United States) instrumentequipped with an electrospray (ESI) source. Capillary voltagewas 3.5 kV in positive mode and \u22122.5 kV in negative mode;the source was kept at 150\u25e6C; the desolvation temperaturewas 500\u25e6C; cone gas flow, 50 L/h; and desolvation gas flow,800 L/h. Further MS parameters are reported in Vrhovsek et al.,2012.Data AnalysisQuantification was done using Waters MassLynx 4.1 andTargetLynx software.Microorganisms and MediaFor antifungal susceptibility testing, the reference strainC. albicans ATCC MYA-2876 from the American Type CultureCollection (ATCC), Rockville, MD, United States was used. Thehuman gut clinical isolates, C. albicans YN7, C. parapsilosis YB1,C. parapsilosis YB3 (Di Paola et al., unpublished), C. albicansYHS254, C. albicans YHS89, C. lusitaniae YHS217, C. lusitaniaeYHS72, C. parapsilosis YHS133, C. parapsilosis YHS312,C. parapsilosis YHS301, Aspergillus glaucus YHS165, Penicilliumpaneum YHS245 (Strati et al., 2016), C. glabrata MFB004,C. tropicalis MFB035-1, C. tropicalis RTT037-3 (Strati et al.,unpublished) were tested for their susceptibility against theapplied drugs. All strains were grown on Sabouraud agarizedmedium for 48 h at 30\u25e6C before testing.Antifungal Susceptibility TestingCandida strains were tested for their susceptibility toHypericum spp. extracts (7 dilution series, ranging from500 to 8 \u00b5g/ml) following the European Committee forAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing protocol (EUCASTDEFINITIVE DOCUMENT EDef 7.2 Revision; EuropeanCommittee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, 2012).Briefly, cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium supplied with2.0% glucose, counted and inoculated at a concentrationof 1\u20135 \u00d7 105 CFU/ml. MIC50 and MIC90 values weredetermined at 530 nm using a spectrophotometer, as thelowest concentration of the drug that resulted in \u226550% and\u226590% inhibition of growth relative to the growth control after48 h incubation.PBMC IsolationPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained frombuffy coat of healthy donors (as approved by the EthicalCommittee of the local health centre, Azienda Provincialeper I Servizi Sanitari, Provincia Autonoma di Trento)within 4 h from sample collection. PBMC isolation wasperformed using Lympholite (CEDARLANE) density gradient(1.077 g/liter, pH 6,9), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions,and incubated in complete nutrient RPMI 1640 medium(Euroclone) supplemented with glutamine (2 mol/L), 10%fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics (10000 U/ml Penicillin,10000 \u00b5g/ml Streptomycin) (Biological Industries), at 37\u25e6C and5% CO2.Cytotoxicity AssayThe cytotoxicity of H. hircinum subsp. majus infusion,methanolic and hydro-alcoholic extracts was tested using theWST-8 (4-[3-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate sodium salt) conversionassay. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was evaluated ontwo normal cell lines, namely PBMC and human foreskinfibroblast Hs27. Cells were seeded in 96-well culture platesat concentration of 5000 cells/well and incubated for 24 hbefore treatment with H. hircinum subsp. majus extracts.Plant extracts were diluted in DMSO and added to a finalconcentration of 500 \u00b5g/ml (final volume of DMSO 0,5%v/v). To measure the cytotoxic effects 10 \u00b5l of Cell CountingKit-8 (Sigma-Aldrich) (containing the WST-8 solution) wereadded to each well and incubated for 2\u20134 h for fibroblasts andPBMCs, respectively, at 37\u25e6C before reading the absorbance at450 nm.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 382141fphar-09-00382 April 20, 2018 Time: 12:10 # 4Tocci et al.

Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal ExtractsThe results were analyzed by Student\u2019s t-test. The data areexpressed as the percentage of viability and standard error of themean.MicroscopyTo estimate the impact of plant extracts on cell morphology andhealth, cultures were visualized and recorded using an invertedmicroscope Motic AE31 equipped with a camera Moticam 5805.0 MP.RESULTSExtract CompositionThe extracts have been chemically characterized by theidentification and quantification of 52 low molecular weightpolyphenols belonging to the classes: flavonols, benzoatesand cinnamates, chalcones, flavan-3-ols, flavones, stilbens,coumarins, phloroglucinols, and naphtodianthrones (Table 1).LC-MS analysis revealed that species were characterized bydifferent content of the detected metabolites, yet in all of theextracts, quercetin derivatives represented the most prevalentgroup of compounds.Quercetin and quercetin glycosides ranged from 5,21 mg/gin H. montanum to 9,4 mg/g in H. hircinum subsp. majus,with hyperoside being the major compounds in the extractsrepresenting the 45,48% of the detected compounds inH. perforatum and more than the 99% in the other Hypericumspecies. Quercetin-3-glucoside was abundant in H. maculatumand in H. montanum, while quercetin 3-rhamnoside was highlypresent in H. perforatum (132,9 \u00b5g/g). Quercetin-3-glucuronideonly occurred in H. hircinum subsp. majus (28,8 \u00b5g/g) andin H. perforatum (10-fold less concentrated). Chlorogenicacid derivatives (chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, andcryptochlorogenic acid) ranged from 38 \u00b5g/g for H. hirsutumand H. perforatum to 456,7 \u00b5g/g in H. hircinum subsp. majus.Also the flavan-3-ols were relatively abundant ranging from53,12 \u00b5g/g in H. hircinum subsp. majus to 100,12 \u00b5g/g inH. maculatum, with epicatechin being the principal compoundof this class (from 19 \u00b5g/g in H. hircinum subsp. majus up to68,5 \u00b5g/g in H. maculatum).Antifungal Activity of Hypericum CrudeExtractsHypericum extracts were screened against a panel of clinicalCandida isolates (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2) and theresults are hereafter given as GM of MIC values. The screeningunveiled that H. hircinum subsp. majus crude methanolic extracthad a strong anti-Candida activity against all tested fungalstrains, with inhibition properties against C. parapsilosis (MIC5053,5 \u00b5g/ml) in the same magnitude of fluconazole (MIC5022,63 \u00b5g/ml).All extracts exerted antifungal properties against C. albicansand C. lusitaniae while only H. hircinum subsp. majus was alsoactive against C. tropicalis and C. glabrata (MIC50 353,55 and16 \u00b5g/ml, respectively).Also, with respect to the to the MIC90 values, H. hircinumsubsp.majus extract showed higher inhibitory properties than theother tested extracts (Supplementary Table S2).TABLE 2 | Antifungal activity of Hypericum species.Species (strain no.)

Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal ExtractsAntifungal Activity of H. hircinum subsp.majus ExtractsThe antifungal activity of H. hircinum subsp. majus was furtherinvestigated against a broader panel of Candida, includingfluconazole resistant strains, and other fungi (Table 3 andSupplementary Table S3). In addition to crude methanolicextract, infusion and hydroalcoholic extracts have been tested.Notably, all H. hircinum subsp. majus extracts showed antifungalproperties and, in particular a remarkable activity againstfluconazole resistant C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis strains.The methanolic extract showed the most pronounced cytotoxicproperties. Yet, in general the antifungal activity of the infusionoutcompeted those of the hydroalcoholic extract, also withrespect to the MIC90 values.Cytotoxicity of H. hircinum subsp. majusExtractsThe cytototoxicity ofH. hircinum subsp.majus extracts was testedon PBMC and human skin fibroblast Hs27 cell lines by usingthe WST-8 conversion assay. The extracts were tested at a doseof 500 \u00b5g/ml, which corresponds to a 1- (for C. tropicalis) to10-fold higher concentration than those showing inhibition of50% of Candida growth. As shown in Figure 1, only the plantinfusion showed no cytotoxic effect on both human cell lines,while treatment with methanolic and hydroalcoholic extractsinhibited cell viability by 50% for Hs27 cell line and by 65\u201370%for PBMCs.The effect of H. hircinum subsp. majus on human cells was alsoobserved microscopically (Figure 2). The imagines confirmed thecytotoxicity data. Fibroblast treated with plant infusion showeda normal phenotype, while under treatment with methanolicand hydro-alcoholic extracts the cell morphology was markedlyaltered. The same alteration was observed for PBMCs (data notshown).Chemical Composition of H. hircinumsusbps. majus InfusionThe chemical composition of the aqueous extract of H. hircinumsubsp. majus is reported in Table 4. The analysis revealed thatthe infusion process allowed the extraction of higher amountsof phenols in comparison to the extraction by macerationin methanol. The aqueous extract was mainly characterizedby derivatives of quercetin (24,18 mg/g), of chlorogenic acid(4,51 mg/g) and by flavan-3-ols (2,26 mg/g). Hyperoside wasthe most abundant compound, representing the 2,23% of theextract. Abundant were also quercetin-3-glucoside (1,65 mg/g),neochlorogenic acid (2,61 mg/g), chlorogenic acid (1,68 mg/g),procyanidin B2 (0,89 mg/g), epicatechin (0,59 mg/g) andprocyanidin B1(0,40 mg/g).DISCUSSIONPlant-based treatments of the traditional medicine could bringforth new solutions for antifungal therapies. In particularpolyphenol-rich plants represent an import source of bioactiveproducts for human health (Marchelak et al., 2017) includingantifungal treatments. Among polyphenols, flavan-3-ols,flavonols and tannins show a high antimicrobial potential(Daglia, 2012). Flavan-3-ols isolated from green and black teaexert important anti-Candida activity (Hirasawa and Takada,2004; Sitheeque et al., 2009), ellagitannins obtained from Punicagranatum inhibit the growth of plant pathogenic fungi (Glazeret al., 2012), the flavonols myricitrin and fisetin are consideredeffective agents against Candida glabrata and Cryptococcusneoformans, respectively (Salazar-Aranda et al., 2015; Reis et al.,2016). The mechanisms of action of phenols against Candidahave been intensively studied and include inactivation ofenzyme production (Evensen and Braun, 2009) and anti-biofilmeffects (Evensen and Braun, 2009; Shahzad et al., 2014).

Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal Extractsbelonging to the Hypericum genus are able to synthesize a broadarray of such bioactive phenolic compounds, mainly as productsof the polyketide metabolism (Tocci et al., 2018b), and thereforemight contain novel antifungal remedies.Here we report new data on the inhibitory activity of extractsderiving from H. montanum, H. maculatum, H. hirsutum,and H. hircinum subsp. majus and additional data on theactivity of H. perforatum on the growth of clinical isolates ofCandida spp. The crude extracts obtained from H. maculatum,H. montanum, H. hirsutum, and H. perforatum showed amoderate antifungal activity against C. albicans, in the rangeof 250\u2013500 \u00b5g/ml, good activity against C. lusitaniae (64\u2013125 \u00b5g/ml) and no or only weak activity against C. parapsilosis,C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Our data are in accordancewith those of Radulovic\u00b4 et al., 2007, showing that extractsof H. hirsutum, H. maculatum, and H. perforatum exertedcomparable antifungal activity against C. albicans using thedisk diffusion method assay. Discordant data are reportedin Cecchini et al., 2007 which found no activity of extractsobtained from H. hirsutum or H. montanum against C. albicans.Most interesting, the antifungal screening of crude extractsunveiled the promising anti-Candida properties of H. hircinumsubsp. majus. The test showed that extracts obtained fromthis species are able to inhibit 50% of growth of C. albicansat concentrations that are fourfold to eightfold lower thanother Hypericum extracts and with a more pronounced activityagainst C. parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae. Moreover H. hircinummethanolic extract was the only treatment able to inhibit thegrowth of C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. These results areimportant especially in the light of the increasing incidenceof infections caused by emerging Candida pathogens likeC. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei, whichare less susceptible to the commonly used antifungal drugs(Tortorano et al., 2006; Papon et al., 2013). Previous data onthe antifungal activity of H. hircinum are scarce and limitedto susceptibility tests against just a single reference strainof C. albicans. Using the disk diffusion test method Pistelliet al., 2000 found no antifungal activity against the testedstrain, while Cecchini et al., 2007 reported a higher activity ofH. hircinum subsp. majus in comparison to other Hypericumspecies.From a chemical point of view, the extracts applied astreatments in our tests have been deeply characterized byinvestigating the presence of 52 phenolic compounds. Ingeneral, the most abundant classes of detected compoundswere flavonols, benzoate and cinnamates (chlorogenic acidand neochlorogenic acid), and flavan-3-ols. The majormetabolite in all the extracts was the flavonol hyperoside,ranging from 4940 \u00b1 66,3 \u00b5g/g in H. montanum to9306 \u00b1 385 \u00b5g/g in H. hircinum subsp. majus, and veryabundant were the neochlorogenic acid and the flavan-3-olepicatechin. Hyperoside is known for its anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties (Ogawa et al.,2014). The extract of H. hircinum subsp. majus, showedseveral chemical peculiarities. It contained the highestamount of hyperoside, higher amounts of chlorogenicacid, quercetin-3-glucuronide, kampferol-3-glucuronide,catechin, epigallogatechin, gallocatechin, and no traces ofthe phloroglucinol hyperforin and of the naphtodianthronehypericin.In the light of its pronounced growth inhibition propertiesagainst Candida spp. and considering the ethnobotanicalknowledge available for this species, H. hircinum subsp. majushas been further subjected to a deeper antifungal screen.TABLE 4 | Analysis of phenolic compounds in the infusion of H. hircinum subsp. majus.Compound Amount (\u00b5g/g extract) Compound Amount (\u00b5g/g extract)2,6-di-OH-benzoic acid nd\u2217\u2217 Kaempferol 1,08 \u00b1 0,153,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 7,08 \u00b1 0,79 Kaempferol -3-glucoside 7,89 \u00b1 1,09Caffeic acid 44,62 \u00b1 4,97 Kaempferol-3-glucuronide 104,41 \u00b1 14,49Coniferyl alcohol nd\u2217 Iso-rhamnetin 0,78 \u00b1 0,11Gallic acid 15,74 \u00b1 2,18 Iso-rhamnetine-3-glucoside nd\u2217Cinnamic acid 6,10 \u00b1 0,85 Syringetin-3-glucoside 3,39 \u00b1 0,46p-coumaric acid nd\u2217 Myricetin 7,68 \u00b1 1,07p-OH-benzoic acid 8,97 \u00b1 1,24 Luteolin 3,51 \u00b1 0,22Vanillic acid 1,29 \u00b1 0,18 Luteolin 7-O-glucoside 1,77 \u00b1 0,24Cryptochlorogenic acid 229,7 \u00b1 31,88 Naringenin nd\u2217Chlorogenic acid 1683 \u00b1 233,7 Esculin 21,28 \u00b1 2,95Neochlorogenic acid 2615 \u00b1 362,9 Phlorizin 6,57 \u00b1 0,91Hyperoside 22203 \u00b1 380 Catechin 282,2 \u00b1 2,71Quercetin 164,38 \u00b1 15,52 Epicatechin 586,51 \u00b1 68,05Quercetin-3-arabinoside nd\u2217 Epigallocatechin 55,77 \u00b1 7,74Quercetin-3-glucoside 1647 \u00b1 65,03 Gallocatechin 48,92 \u00b1 9,72Quercetin-3-glucuronide 104,41 \u00b1 14,92 Procyanidin B1 401,6 \u00b1 55,74Quercetin-3-sulfate nd\u2217 Procyanidin B2 886,16 \u00b1 108,77Rutin nd\u2217 cis-piceid 1,37 \u00b1 0,19Data are means of three independent experiments, \u2217nd, not detected.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 382145fphar-09-00382 April 20, 2018 Time: 12:10 # 8Tocci et al. Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal ExtractsH. hircinum is a shrub native to the areas of the MediterraneanBasin comprising Greece and Turkey (Euro+Med, 2006).The infusion of its aerial part is applied in the traditionalmedicine to treat chronic catarrhal affections, asthma, sorethroats and cough (Pieroni et al., 2004). Recent scientificevidences indicate that fungi of the phyla Basidiomycetesand Ascomycetes (e.g., Bjerkandera, Aspergillus, Candida, andSaccharomyces) are causative agents of these pathologies (Razaet al., 2017).To investigate whether the beneficial effect of H. hircinumtreatments may be attributed to its antifungal activity, we studied,for the first time, the activity of extracts obtained from theaerial parts of the plant with a hydroalcoholic solution and,in accordance with the traditional preparations, by infusionin boiling water. Additionally, we characterized the chemicalprofile. The assay was performed on a broad panel of clinicalCandida strains, a strain of Aspergillus glaucus and a strainof Penicillium paneum (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S3).The extract obtained from the herbal tea inhibited 50% ofthe growth of all tested fungi, showing strong activity againstboth fluconazole sensitive and resistant Candida strains andmoderate activity against Aspergillus and Penicillium strains.The chemical profile revealed an enrichment in the polyphenolcontent in comparison with the crude methanolic extract.Particularly abundant (content higher than 40 \u00b5g/g extract) werecaffeic acid, chlorogenic, neochlorogenic and cryptochlorogenicacid, quercetin, quercetin-3-glucoside, quercetin-3-glucuronide,kaempferol-3-glucuronide, all the flavan-3-ols investigated andextraordinary high levels of hyperoside were detected. Evenif the bioactivity may be due to the synergistic action ofthe phytocomplex, it appears reasonable to exclude caffeicacid, chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3-glucuronide, kaempferol-3-glucuronide, and gallocatechin as secondary metabolites towhich the antifungal activity may be attributed, since thesecompounds are not present in the other Hypericum extractsshowing growth inhibitory properties on Candida strains.Also, cryptochlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid quercetin,quercetin-3-glucoside, epicatechin, have been detected in allthe crude extract, but they were less present in H. hircinumsubsp. majus and thus their presence cannot be consideredcorrelated to the bioactivity. According to our data a positivecorrelation between the amount of catechin, epigallocatechin,procyanidin B1 and hyperoside and the antifungal activity exertedcan be individuated. The anti-Candida properties of flavan-3-ols, and in particular of catechin and epigallocatechin, are wellknown and documented (Hirasawa and Takada, 2004; Saitoet al., 2013). Nevertheless, our data suggest that the hyperoside,being detected in such high amounts in the extract obtained bythe infusion of H. hircinum subsp. majus in water, may playa fundamental role in the observed fungal growth inhibitionproperties. The hypothesis is supported by studies proposinghyperoside as a lead for the development of new fungicides (Liet al., 2005).Finally, the aqueous extract of H. hircinum subsp. majusshowed another promising characteristic exploitable for thedevelopment of a new antifungal therapy. When tested at highconcentrations on human PBMCs and human skin fibroblastHs27cell lines, no cytotoxicity was detected.CONCLUSIONOur work reports a comprehensive phenolic profile of fiveEuropean Hypericum species, highlighting the presence ofimportant exploitable bioactive metabolites. The infusion ofH. hircinum subsp. majus used in the popular medicine for thetreatment of respiratory tract affections has been chemically andbiologically investigated for the first time. The chemical analysisunveiled a new source of the bioactive metabolite hyperosidethat might be involved in the observed bioactivity of the extract.The biological tests suggest that the beneficial effects of thetraditional remedies based on H. hircinum could be attributed toits antiseptic, and in particular to its antifungal properties againstfungal pathogens of the respiratory tract. Moreover, the lack ofcytotoxicity indicates the presence of exploitable and promisingantimycotic principles for the development of an antifungaltherapy with limited cytotoxic side effects. Hence it encouragesfuture studies to assess the effective therapeutic properties ofH. hircinum subsp. majus with particular attention to thetreatment of fungal-associated pathologies of the respiratorytract.ETHICS STATEMENTPBMCs were obtained from buffy coats prepared from blooddonations collected at the Centro Trasfusionale c/o OspedaleSanta Chiara, Trento, after donor\u2019s signed informed consent.Study procedures were approved by the Comitato Etico perle Sperimentazioni Cliniche, Azienda Provinciale per i ServiziSanitari di Trento on the 12th February 2015.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSNT, TW, and FM conceived the study and wrote the manuscriptwith contributions from all authors.

Kiss 1*1 Department of Pharmacognosy and Molecular Basis of Phytotherapy, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland,2 Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies of Polish Academy of Sciences, Lodz, PolandAim of the study: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects ofphytochemically characterized extracts connected with the traditional use (infusionsand ethanolic extracts) of different parts of Syringa vulgaris (common lilac) on thepro-inflammatory functions of neutrophils. Active compounds were isolated from themost promising extract(s) using bioassay-guided fractionation, and their activity andmolecular mechanisms of action were determined.Methods: The extracts were characterized using a HPLC-DAD- MSn method.The effects on ROS, MMP-9, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, and MCP-1 production by neutrophilswere measured using luminol-dependent chemiluminescence and enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. The effects on p38MAPK, ERK1/2, JNKphosphorylation, and NF-kB p65 translocation were determined using western blots.Results: The major compounds detected in the extracts and infusions belongto structural groups, including caffeic acid derivatives, flavonoids, and iridoids.All extracts and infusions were able to significantly reduce ROS and IL-8production. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of the followingsecoiridoids: 2\u2032\u2032-epiframeroside, oleonuezhenide, oleuropein, ligstroside, neooleuropein,hydroxyframoside, and framoside. Neooleuropein appeared to be the most activecompound in the inhibition of cytokine production by attenuating the MAP kinasepathways.Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that common lilac, which is a traditionallyused medicinal plant in Europe, is a valuable source of active compounds, especiallyneooleuropein.Keywords: Syringa vulgaris, Oleaceae, secoiridoids, neooleuropein, pro-inflammatory mediators, neutrophils149Woz\u00b4niak et al. Effects of Syringa Secoiridoids on Mediators of InflammationINTRODUCTIONThe Oleaceae family encompasses 25 genera and \u223c600 species.Members of this family include trees, shrubs, or woody climberswith almost worldwide distribution from northern temperateto southern subtropical regions, with the exception of theAntarctic. Genera include Olea (20 spp.), Forsythia (7\u201311 spp.),Fraxinus (40\u201370 spp.), Syringa (20\u201330 spp.), Osmanthus (15\u201330 spp.), Jasminum (200\u2013300 spp.), Chionanthus (80\u2013100 spp.),and Ligustrum (40\u201350 spp.) (Jensen et al., 2002; Evans, 2009).In Central-Eastern Europe, only a few representatives of theOleaceae family are found: Fraxinus exelsior L., Ligustrumvulgare L., Syringa vulgaris L., and Forsythia sp. Moreover,Olea (leaves) and Fraxinus (leaves) have monographs in theEuropean Pharmacopoeia as well as European Agency EMEAmonographs. The Syringa genus is distributed in Eurasia, whichis subdivided into western (Central and Southeast Europe) andeastern zones (Central to East Asia) (Wallander and Albert,2000). Most of the species are found in Asia, while only S.vulgaris and S. josikaea are found in Europe (Jensen et al., 2002;Lendvay et al., 2016). S. vulgaris L., known as the commonlilac, is native to the Balkan peninsula and is widely cultivatedas an ornamental plant in Europe. In Poland, it has beennaturalized since the sixteenth century, where it is cultivatedbut also found in the wild (Witkowska-Zuk, 2013). In Europeanethnopharmacology, the common lilac inflorescence or leavesin the form of an infusion or alcoholic extract were used totreat gout, rheumatism and muscle/joint aches (Fournier, 1948;Hanlidou et al., 2010; Jaric\u00b4 et al., 2015; S\u00f5ukand and Pieroni,2016). In Poland, Bulgaria, Italy, and Greece, the flowers, leaves,bark, or fruits in the forms of infusions, decoctions, or alcoholicextracts were used as antipyretics and to treat cold, cough, etc.(Fournier, 1948; Kuznicka, 1986; Kuzniewski and Augustyn-Puziewicz, 1986; Anio\u0142-Kwiatkowska et al., 1993; Leporattiand Ivancheva, 2003; Hanlidou et al., 2010). Locally, differentparts of the plant are used to treat toothaches, gastrointestinaldisorders, skin wounds, and other ailments (Kuznicka, 1986;Kuzniewski and Augustyn-Puziewicz, 1986; Anio\u0142-Kwiatkowskaet al., 1993; Agelet and Vall\u00e8s, 2003; Hanlidou et al., 2010;Papp et al., 2014). Interestingly, in North American materiamedica (pharmacognosy) textbooks, the antipyretic use of theleaves, flowers, and fruits of the common lilac was mentioned(Lyle, 1897; Remington andWoods, 1918), and native Americansused to chew the bark or leaves for treating a sore mouth(Moerman, 1998). The Asian species are also used in traditionalmedicine to treat bronchial disease [Syringa reticulata (Blume)H. Hara leaves], lung and heart diseases (Syringa pinnatifoliaHemsl. stem), tooth pain (Syringa vetulina Kom. Bark), andas antipyretics (Syringa afghanica C.K. Schneid. leaves) (Parket al., 1999; Takenaka et al., 2002; Machida et al., 2009; Su et al.,2016).Scientific data supporting the traditional use of S. vulgarisare connected with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive and antipyretic properties (B\u00e1linet, 1971; T\u00f3th et al.,2015, 2016; Dudek et al., 2017). Moreover, information aboutthe single compounds responsible for each of these activities isscarce.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectsof phytochemically characterized (HPLC-DAD-MSn) extractsconnected with the traditional use (infusions and ethanolicextracts) of different parts of the common lilac (bark, fruits,leaves and flowers) on the pro-inflammatory functions ofneutrophils, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production,metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and tumornecrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) release. We isolated active compoundsfrom the most promising extracts using bioassay-guidedfractionation. Finally, we focused on the activity and molecularmechanisms of action of the isolated compounds that were ableto regulate neutrophil inflammation. The biological activitiesof single compounds were compared with oleuropein andligstroside, characteristic compounds from the Oleacea family(Jensen et al., 2002), and with positive control clarithromycin,a macrolide antibiotic, which has been shown to inhibit thepro-inflammatory function of neutrophils (Simpson et al., 2008;Cervin et al., 2009).MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and General ExperimentalProceduresHanks\u2019 balanced salt solution (HBSS), RPMI 1640, f-MLP(formyl-Met-Leu-Phenylalanine), LPS (from Escherichia coli0111:B4), HEPES solution, and L-glutamine were purchasedfrom Sigma\u2013Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Germany).

Preparative HPLC was performed with a Shimadzu LC-20AP instrument (Japan) using a Zorbax SB-C18 column(150 \u00d7 21.2mm, 5\u00b5m) (Agilent, USA) at a flow rate of20.0 mL/min. TLC was performed on Merck silica gel 60 F254 (0.25mm) plates with a dichloromethane/methanol/formicacid/water (80:25:1.5:4; v/v/v/v) solvent system. Chromatogramswere visualized by spraying with sulfuric acid (5% in methanol)followed by heating at 105\u25e6C for 10min. All solvents usedfor chromatography were of gradient grade. HPLC-DAD-MSnanalysis was performed on a UHPLC-3000 RS system (Dionex,Germany) with DAD detection and an AmaZon SL ion trap massspectrometer with an ESI interface (Bruker Daltonik GmbH,Germany). Separation was performed on a Zorbax SB-C18column (150 \u00d7 2.1mm, 1.9\u00b5m) (Agilent, USA).

The LC eluate was introduced into the ESI interface withoutsplitting, and compounds were analyzed in negative ion modewith the following settings: nebulizer pressure of 40 psi; dryinggas flow rate of 9 L/min; nitrogen gas temperature of 300\u25e6C; anda capillary voltage of 4.5 kV. The mass scan ranged from 100 to2,200m/z. UV spectra were recorded in the range of 200\u2013400 nm.The absorbance and luminescence were measured usinga BioTek microplate reader (Highland Park, USA). Flowcytometry was performed using a BD FACSCalibur apparatus(BD Biosciences, USA).Plant MaterialBark from the branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits of S. vulgarisL. were collected in May and August (fruits) 2016, from anative plant growing in Legionowo, Mazovian district, Poland(52\u25e6 23\u2032 17.647\u2032\u2032 N; 20\u25e6 55\u2032 53.171\u2032\u2032 E). The plant material wasauthenticated according to Flora Europaea (Tutin et al., 1972)by Anna K. Kiss. A voucher specimen (no. SV052015) has beendeposited in the Plant Collection, Department of Pharmacognosyand Molecular Basis of Phytotherapy, Medical University ofWarsaw, Poland (Figure 1S).Extract Preparation and PhytochemicalCharacterization by HPLC-DAD-MS/MSInfusions (Aqueous Extracts)Air-dried plant materials (5 g) were poured with boiling water(250mL), covered, and allowed to stand for 15min. Extracts werethen filtered and lyophilized, resulting in the following aqueousextract masses: bark- 0.52 g, fruit- 0.48 g, flower- 1.69 g, and leaf-1.04 g.Ethanolic ExtractsThe air-dried plant materials (2 g) were extracted with 60%ethanol (v/v, 1:20) in a water bath (70\u25e6C) for 1 h. Then, extractswere filtered, the ethanol was evaporated, and the water residueswere lyophilized, resulting in the following ethanolic extractmasses: bark- 0.25 g, fruit- 0.21 g, flower- 0.58 g and leaf- 0.51 g.The extracts were characterized using an HPLC-DAD-MS/MSmethod. The presence of substances in extracts was confirmedby comparing the retention times and spectra (UV, MS, MS/MS)with standards and/or published data.Bioassay-Guided Isolation of ActiveCompounds From Leaf ExtractThe air-dried plant material (100 g) was crushed and extractedthree times with 75% methanol (1:10) at 70\u25e6C for 1 h each time(3 times). The methanol from combined extracts was evaporatedunder reduced pressure, and the aqueous residue was lyophilizedto yield 40 g of extract. The crude extract was subjected to DiaionHP-20 (Supelco) column chromatography (45\u00d7 5 cm) and elutedwith an H2O-MeOH gradient (100:0\u2192 0:100, v/v) in 5 steps of1.5 L each to obtain 35 fractions, which were pooled into 6 mainfractions (F1-F6) based on their TLC and HPLC profiles. Theactivity of the fractions toward the inhibition of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 was tested at a concentration of 50\u00b5g/mL. Active fraction F6(2.5 g) was subjected to further separation on a Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) column (25 \u00d7 3 cm) with H2O-MeOH (50:50,v/v) to obtain 20 fractions of 50mL each, which were pooled into6 main fractions (F6_1\u2013F6_6) based on their TLC and HPLCprofiles. From fraction F6_2 (235mg), compounds I (75mg; Rt= 11.3\u201312.3min.) and II (13mg; Rt = 13.4\u201313.9); from fractionF6_3 (633mg), compounds III (78mg; Rt = 8.3\u20138.9min) andIV (90mg; Rt = 11.9\u201312.7min), from fraction F6_4 (243mg),compounds V (5mg; Rt= 12.0\u201312.3min), VI (23mg; Rt= 15.4-16.0min) andVII (7mg; Rt= 19.0\u201319.5min) were isolated usingpreparative HPLC with a gradient of 0.1%HCOOH in H2O-0.1%HCOOH in MeCN (80:20\u2192 40:60) over 60min.Preparation of Solutions of Extracts,Fractions, and Compounds for BioassayTested extracts were dissolved in PBS or HBSS (1 mg/mL).Fractions and compounds were dissolved in DMSO (10 mg/mLor 10mM stock solutions) and then diluted with RPMI 1640medium. The extracts were tested in a concentration range of25\u2013100\u00b5g/mL. Compounds were tested at concentrations of10-50\u00b5M. The concentration of DMSO used (<0.1%) did notinfluence the assays.Isolation of Human NeutrophilsPeripheral venous blood was taken from healthy human donors(18\u201335 years old) in theWarsaw Blood Donation Centre. Donorsdid not smoke or take any medications. They were clinicallyrecognized to be healthy and a routine laboratory tests showedall values to be within the normal ranges. The study conformedto the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.Neutrophils were isolated by dextran sedimentation andcentrifugation in a Ficoll Hypaque gradient (B\u00f6yum, 1968) andthen re-suspended in HBSS buffer or RPMI 1640 medium.CytotoxicityCytotoxicity was determined by a standard flow cytometric probeusing propidium iodide (PI) staining. After 24 h of incubationwith extracts/compounds, the neutrophils were harvested andcentrifuged (1500 RPM; 10min; 4\u25e6C), washed once with coldPBS and re-suspended in 400 \u00b5L of PBS. Five microliters of PI(50\u00b5g/mL) solution was added to the cell suspensions. After15min of incubation at room temperature, cells were analyzedby flow cytometry, and 10,000 events were recorded per sample.Cells that displayed high permeability to PI were expressed as apercentage of PI(+) cells.ROS ProductionNeutrophils (3.5 \u00d7 105) were incubated in HBSS buffer with50 \u00b5L of the tested extracts and 50 \u00b5L of luminol (20mM) ina 96-well plate. ROS production was initiated by the additionof f-MLP (0.1\u00b5g/mL) to obtain a total volume of 200 \u00b5L/well.Chemiluminescence changes were measured over 40min atintervals of 2min in a microplate reader. The backgroundchemiluminescence produced by non-stimulated cells was alsodetermined. The percentage of inhibition was calculated bycomparison to the control without the tested extracts at themaximum luminescence.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 349151Woz\u00b4niak et al. Effects of Syringa Secoiridoids on Mediators of InflammationIL-8, MMP-9, MCP-1, and TNF-\u03b1ProductionNeutrophils (2 \u00d7 106) were cultured in 24-well plates in RPMI1640 medium with 10% FBS, 10mM HEPES, and 2mM L-glutamine in the presence or absence of LPS (100 ng/mL) for24 h at 37\u25e6C with 5% CO2 in the presence or absence oftest extracts/fractions/compounds. After 24 h, the neutrophilswere harvested and centrifuged (2000 RPM; 10min; 4\u25e6C). Theamount of released cytokines was measured by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) following the manufacturer\u2019sinstructions (BD Biosciences, USA). The effects on IL-8, MMP-9, MCP-1, and TNF-\u03b1 production were calculated by comparingthe percentages of the released agents to the stimulated control,which lacked the test extracts/fractions/compounds.Western BlottingNeutrophils (4 \u00d7 106) were suspended in RPMI 1640 mediumand incubated for 40min at 37\u25e6C in the presence or absenceof LPS (100 ng/mL) and in the presence or absence of thetest compounds. They were then centrifuged at 1500 RPM for10min at 4\u25e6C. Cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer containingPBS, 5mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, phosphatase and proteaseinhibitors, and the resulting lysates were centrifuged at 8,000RPM for 15min at 4\u25e6C. The proteins were separated by 12%SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters andimmunoblotted with rabbit anti-p38MAPK, anti-ERK1/2, andanti-JNK at 1:1000 dilutions and a rabbit anti-actin polyclonalantibody at a 1:2000 dilution. Peroxidase-conjugated affinipuregoat anti-rabbit antibody was used as a secondary antibody ata dilution of 1:10000. Finally, the blots were incubated withchemiluminescent substrate for the detection of HRP (Thermo-Scientific, USA) for 10\u201315min. Western blots were quantifiedusing the ImageJ 1.38 software after densitometric scanning ofthe bands.Statistical AnalysisThe results were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM of threeindependent experiments performed at least in duplicate. Allanalyses were performed using Statistica 9 software. Thestatistical significance of the differences between means wasestablished by ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s or Tukey\u2019s post hoc test.P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSPhytochemical Characterization andComparison of S. vulgaris From Bark, Fruit,Flower and Leaf Infusions and EthanolicExtractsThe phytochemical analysis of S. vulgaris bark, fruit, flowerand leaf infusions and ethanolic extracts was performedusing a HPLC-DAD-MS/MS method, which allowed for theidentification or partial identification of 64 compounds (Table 1and Figure 1) from the following groups: phenylethanoids(compounds 27, 31, 36, 39, and 42), rare phenylethanoidsesterified with an oleoside 11-methyl ester (compounds 43, 49,50, and 61), flavonoids (compounds 32, 33, and 35), otherphenolic compounds (1\u20133, 5\u201314, 17, 18, and 24), lignans(compounds 21 and 37), iridoids (compounds 34 and 41),secoiridoids (compounds 4, 15, 16, 20, 26, 28-30, 38, 40, 44\u201346, 48, 51\u201357, 60, 62, and 63), together with eight unknowncompounds. Compounds 1, 2, 5, 7, 14\u201316, 27\u201329, 34, 36, 38,41, 43\u201346, 48\u201350, 52\u201354, 61 were previously isolated as purecompounds from S. vulgaris leaves, flowers, and bark (Kurkinet al., 1989, 1990; Damtoft et al., 1995; Kikuchi et al., 2010;Dudek et al., 2017). However, this is a first comprehensivephytochemical analysis of a broad range of compounds fromdifferent parts of the plant. Significant differences were observedin the phytochemical profiles of different plant parts (Table 1 andFigure 1). In bark extracts, themajor compounds were as follows:syringin (14; Rt = 16.9min, m/z 417 [M-H+HCOOH]\u2212),demethyloleuropein (28; Rt = 28.2min, m/z 525 [M-H]\u2212),forsythoside B (31; Rt = 30.0min, m/z 755 [M-H]\u2212), acteoside(36; Rt = 31.4min, m/z 623 [M-H]\u2212) and oleuropein (46;Rt = 38.3min, m/z 539 [M-H]\u2212). In fruit extracts, the majorcompounds were as follows: nuzhenide (38; Rt = 33.0min, m/z685 [M-H]\u2212) and an oleonuezhenide isomer (55; Rt = 43.3min,m/z 1071 [M-H]\u2212). In flower extracts, the major compoundswere as follows: caffeoylglucaric acid (5; Rt= 10.1min, m/z 371[M-H]\u2212), quercetin rutinoside (32; Rt = 30.1min, m/z 609 [M-H]\u2212), acteoside (36; Rt= 31.4min,m/z 623 [M-H]\u2212), oleuropein(46; Rt = 38.3min, m/z 539 [M-H]\u2212), oleoacteoside (49; Rt= 40.1min, m/z 1009 [M-H]\u2212) and oleonuezhenide (60; Rt= 45.4min, m/z 1071 [M-H]\u2212). In leaf extracts, the majorcompounds were as follows: secologanoside (16; Rt= 17.3min,m/z 389 [M-H]\u2212), quercetin rutinoside (32; Rt= 30.1min, m/z609 [M-H]\u2212), syringalactone B (34; Rt = 30.5min, m/z 525 [M-H]\u2212), oleuropein (46; Rt = 38.3min, m/z 539 [M-H]\u2212), 2\u2032\u2032-epi-frameroside (53; Rt= 42.6min,m/z 601 [M-H]\u2212), and ligstroside(54; Rt = 43.1min, m/z 523 [M-H]\u2212). The phytochemicalprofiles of the infusions and ethanolic extracts were similar, andonly quantitative differences were observed.Effect of Bark, Fruit, Flower and LeafInfusions and Ethanolic Extracts ofS. vulgaris on the Pro-inflammatoryFunction of Stimulated NeutrophilsIn all concentrations of the tested extracts, no significantreduction in membrane integrity was observed in comparisonto the control using a propidium iodide assay (Figures 2A,B).Activation of neutrophils by f-MLP results in degranulation anda significant release of ROS compared to the untreated control(Figures 2C,D). Additionally, stimulation with LPS resulted ina significant release of proteinase MMP-9, chemokine IL-8, andcytokine TNF-\u03b1 (Figure 3). Incubation of stimulated neutrophilswith extracts at concentration ranges of 25\u2013100\u00b5g/mL resultedin a statistically significant and dose dependent reduction of ROSproduction by all extracts over all tested concentrations.

The effect on TNF-\u03b1 production/release was less pronounced and was staticallysignificant only at the highest concentration of 100\u00b5g/mLfor bark and leaf ethanolic extracts and the flower infusion(Figures 3C,D). MMP-9 release was inhibited the most by barkand fruit ethanolic extracts (Figures 3E,F). In general, ethanolicextracts were slightly more active than infusions, and flowerand leaf preparations were more active than bark and fruitpreparations. In a previous study, we isolated 29 compoundsthat were hydroxycinnamoyl and secoiridoid derivatives (Dudeket al., 2017) from the flower extract with moderate anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we performed a bioassay-guided isolation of active compounds from the leaf extract.Bioassay-Guided Isolation of ActiveCompounds From Leaf ExtractThe crude alcoholic leaf extract was fractionated using aDiaion HP-20 and eluted with a 5-step H2O-MeOH gradient(100:0 \u2192 0:100) to obtain six main fractions (F1-F6) basedon their TLC and HPLC profiles. The activities of thefractions were evaluated based on IL-8 inhibition and TNF-\u03b1 release. Only fraction F6 inhibited the IL-8 release at aconcentration of 50\u00b5g/mL in a statistically significant manner(p < 0.001). Interestingly, fraction F2 stimulated TNF-\u03b1production, while fractions F5 and F6 decreased the productionof this cytokine (Figure 4). Fraction 5 was rich in oleuropein.Fraction 6, which contained several compounds, was subjectto further fractionation on a Sephadex LH-20 with H2O-MeOH (50:50) and then preparative chromatography was usedto isolate the following seven compounds: 2\u2032\u2032-epiframeroside(I), oleonuezhenide (II), oleuropein (III), ligstroside (IV),neooleuropein (V), hydroxyframoside (VI), and framoside (VII)(Figure 4). The structures of these compounds (Figure 5) wereconfirmed based on their 1H and 13C NMR spectra, whichwere compared with reference data (Fukuyama et al., 1987;Damtoft et al., 1992; Kuwajima et al., 1992; Tanahashi et al., 1992;Iossifova et al., 1998; Konno et al., 1998; Takenaka et al., 2002).Analysis of the extracted ion intensity for single compounds ineach extract confirmed that 2\u2032\u2032-epiframeroside (I), oleuropein(III), ligstroside (IV), neooleuropein (V), hydroxyframoside(VI), and framoside (VII) were the major compounds presentin leaf extract. Only oleonuezhenide (II) was present in a higherconcentration in the flower extract (Figure 2S).Effect on Cytokine/Chemokine Production,MAP Kinases and NF-kB ActivationLipopolysaccharide stimulation of human neutrophils resultedin the induction of the production/release of chemokines IL-8 (neutrophil chemotactic factor) and MCP-1 (monocytechemoattractant protein 1) along with cytokine TNF-\u03b1in comparison to cells that were not stimulated. Isolatedcompounds I, II, V, VI, and VII were tested at concentrationsof 10, 25, and 50\u00b5M, and their activity was compared witholeuropein and ligstroside, the characteristic compounds ofthe Oleacea family that were also isolated from active fractionF6, and with the positive control clarithromycin, a macrolideantibiotic which has been shown to inhibit the pro-inflammatoryfunction of neutrophils.

Neooleuropein was the most activecompound toward inhibiting IL-8 secretion (Figure 6B); atconcentrations of 25 and 50\u00b5M, the release was reduced to50.2% (p < 0.001) and 31.4% (p < 0.001) in comparison withLPS-stimulated cells (100% of release), respectively. The effectof neooleuropein at 50\u00b5M was more significant than the effectsof 2\u2032\u2032-epiframeroside (p < 0.001), oleonuezhenide (p < 0.001),ligstroside (p < 0.001), and oleuropein (p < 0.001) at thesame concentration. Framoside and neooleuropein were themost active in reduction of TNF-\u03b1 release at all concentrationstested (Figure 6C). The effect of framoside at 50\u00b5M was moresignificant than the effect of 2\u2032\u2032-epiframeroside (p < 0.001),oleonuezhenide (p < 0.001), and ligstroside (p < 0.001) at thesame concentration. Additionally, neooleuropein was statisticallymore active than the positive control clarithromycin (p < 0.05).All isolated compounds except oleonuezhenide significantlyinhibited the release of MCP-1 from stimulated neutrophils(Figure 6D). However, only neooleuropein was active at allconcentrations tested (Figure 6D). The effect of neooleuropeinat 10\u00b5M was more significant than the effects of framoside(p < 0.05) and hydroxyframoside (p < 0.05); at 25\u00b5M, theeffect was more significant than the effects of framoside (p <0.01), hydroxyframoside (p < 0.01) and oleonuezhenide (p <0.01), while at 50\u00b5M, the effect was more significant than theeffect of oleonuezhenide (p < 0.001) and the positive controlclarithromycin (p < 0.01) at the same concentration. In general,neooleuropein was as effective or more effective in comparisonwith oleuropein and clarithromycin in reducing the release ofpro-inflammatory agents.The molecular mechanism of the observed effect was relatedto MAP kinases and NF-kB activation. Lipopolysaccharidestimulation of human neutrophils resulted in the rapidphosphorylation of proteins, including p38 MAPK, p42/44extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), as well as the translocation of NF-kB-p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.

The inhibition of the translocation ofNF-kB-p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was observedmost significantly for oleuropein; however, the activity ofneooleuropein was evident but more modest (Figure 7B).DISCUSSIONS. vulgaris preparations have been traditionally used in Europe totreat several ailments connected with inflammation and, togetherwith Asian Syringa sp., appear to be an interesting source ofdiverse bioactive structures (Su et al., 2015). The aim of thepresent study was to investigate the effects of phytochemicallycharacterized (HPLC-DAD-MSn) extracts that have been usedin traditional medicine (infusions and ethanolic extracts) fromdifferent parts of the common lilac (bark, fruits, leaves, andflowers) on the pro-inflammatory functions of neutrophils andto isolate the most active compounds using bioassay-guidedfractionation. Finally, we focused on the activity and molecularmechanisms of action of the isolated compounds able to regulateneutrophil inflammation.For the first time, we provided a comprehensivephytochemical analysis of common lilac and a comparisonof different parts such as bark, fruit, flower, and leafinfusions/extracts (Table 1, Figure 1). We were able to identifyor partially identify 64 compounds, and we also demonstratedsignificant differences in the phytochemical profiles of differentparts of the plant (Figure 1). In general, the major compounds inS. vulgaris are as follows: caffeoylglucaric acid (5), syringin (14),secologanoside (15), demethyloleuropein (28), forsythoside B(31), quercetin rutinoside (32), syringalactone B (34), acteoside(36), nuzhenide (38), oleuropein (46), oleoacteoside (49),2\u2032\u2032-epi-frameroside (53), ligstroside (54), oleonuezhenide isomer(55), and oleonuezhenide (60). The presence of phenyl ethanoids31, 36, 49, and secoiridoids 28, 38, 46, 53, 54, 55, 60 as majorcompounds seems to be specific to this species, while lignansare more characteristic of S. pinnatifolia (Su et al., 2016), andFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 349158Woz\u00b4niak et al.

S. reticulata contains similarphenyl ethanoids and secoiridoids as S. vulgaris; however, thepresence of the iridoid syringapicroside and its derivatives in S.reticulatamay distinguish both species phytochemically (Kikuchiet al., 1989; Machida et al., 2002).In the neutrophil model of the pro-inflammatory state,all extracts and infusions were able to significantly reduceROS production (Figures 2C,D). This is probably relatedto the presence of compounds that contain caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, hydroxytyrosol or tyrosol phenolic moieties,which display antioxidant properties (Bi et al., 2011; Dudeket al., 2017). All extracts and infusions were especially activein decreasing IL-8 production (Figures 3A,B) and, to a lesserextent, MMP-9 and TNF\u03b1 release (Figures 3C\u2013F). However,the leaf extract fractionation revealed that fraction F2 increasedTNF\u03b1 production, while fractions F5 and F6 significantlydecreased the production of this cytokine (Figure 4). A similarphenomenon was observed for Echinacea purpurea extracts(Todd et al., 2015). Further bioassay-guided fractionation offraction F6 led to the isolation of the following secoiridoids:2\u2032\u2032-epiframeroside, oleonuezhenide, oleuropein, ligstroside,neooleuropein, hydroxyframoside, and framoside (Figure 5). Wecompared the anti-inflammatory activity of 2\u2032\u2032-epiframeroside,oleonuezhenide, neooleuropein, hydroxyframoside, andframoside with oleuropein and ligstroside, two well-knowncompounds that are widespread in the Oleaceae family(Jensen et al., 2002). Apart from oleonuezhenide, a dimericsecoiridoid, all compounds exhibited significant inhibition ofpro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release/production.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 349160Woz\u00b4niak et al. Effects of Syringa Secoiridoids on Mediators of Inflammation2\u2032\u2032-epiframeroside primarily inhibited MCP-1 release, whileneooleuropein appeared as themost active compound (Figure 6).Neooleuropein inhibited the secretion of IL-8 more significantlythan oleuropein (Figure 6B) and secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1more significantly than the positive control clarithromycin(Figures 6C,D).The mechanism of LPS stimulation of human neutrophilsis connected with a functional response through the activationof mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): p38 kinase,p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-JunNH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) (Nick et al., 1999; Arndt et al.,2004; Simard et al., 2015). Neooleuropein and oleuropeinsignificantly inhibited the phosphorylation of the MAP kinasesERK1/2, p38 and JNK after LPS stimulation (Figure 7A), as wellas the translocation of NF-kB p65 to the nucleus (Figure 7B).Neooleuropein was more active toward the inhibition of p38phosphorylation, while oleuropein more significantly inhibitedNF-kB p65 translocation, and all tested compounds inhibitedJNK phosphorylation (Figures 7A,B). The activation of p38MAPK in neutrophils is connected with the synthesis of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 (Nick et al., 1999). ERK activation also led to theelevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in humanneutrophils (Simard et al., 2015). In our study, neooleuropein wasthe most active compound in inhibiting p38 phosphorylation,which correlated with a significant inhibition of IL-8 production.However, oleuropein was more active in NF-kB inhibition,which has been shown to affect cytokine gene expression inhuman neutrophils, although it has a less marked effect onIL-8 gene expression (Cloutier et al., 2007). The inhibitionof MCP-1 production by all tested compounds was correlatedwith the inhibition of JNK phosphorylation, which has beenstrictly correlated with MCP-1 expression but not IL-8 or TNF-\u03b1 expression (Arndt et al., 2004). Interestingly, framoside wasable to significantly decrease the TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 secretion(Figures 6B,C) without affecting MAPKs nor NF-kB activation(Figure 7). It appears that framoside, the most lipophiliccompounds, displays a different mode of action. As in humanneutrophils other pathways such as PI3K are also involved in IL-8 production and acts downstream of p38 MAPK (Fortin et al.,2011).The observed significant inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 and chemokine(IL-8 and MCP-1) production is of special interest for treatinginflammatory diseases such as rheumatic arthritis, respiratorydiseases, and arteriosclerosis. The pro-inflammatory effect ofTNF-\u03b1 mainly results from its capacity to stimulate theexpression of adhesive molecules in endothelial cells andpromote neutrophil attachment to the vascular endotheliumin addition to their degranulation and pro-oxidative activity(Witko-Sarsat et al., 2000). MCP-1 (CCL2) is able to stimulatechemotaxis of monocytes and cellular events associated withchemotaxis and integrin expression. At high concentrations,MCP-1 elicits a respiratory burst leading to the generation ofROS (Palomino and Marti, 2015). IL-8 (CXCL8), one of themost important cytokines produced by neutrophils, mediateschemotaxis, releases granule enzymes, and promotes integrinexpression and adhesion to endothelial cells (Gabrilovich, 2013).Although the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity ofoleuropein and ligstroside was intensively studied, this is the firstreport concerning the biological activity of 2\u2032\u2032-epiframeroside,neooleuropein, hydroxyframoside, and framoside. In particular,neooleuropein appears to an interesting compound for further invitro and in vivo study.CONCLUSIONSThe present study demonstrated that the common lilac, whichhas been traditionally used in Europe as a medicinal plant, is avaluable source of active compounds, especially neooleuropein,for further research regarding their use in treating inflammatorydiseases that result from the excessive activation of neutrophils.The observed decreases in the production of cytokines, suchas TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, MCP-1, depend on the inhibition of thephosphorylation of MAP kinases.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSMW, BM, MD, JW, and AK: performed the experiments; MW,BM, MD, and AK: carried out data analysis; AK: plannedthe experiments; AK: wrote the manuscript and supervised allwork.

Inspired by the \u201csignatura rerum\u201d principle and an apparent ancientfolk tradition, various indications were given, such as anti-jaundice and cholagogue,pain-relieving, and quite often mentioned\u2014ophthalmological problems. Central andEastern European folk medicine has always been using this herb extensively. In thisregion, the plant is known under many unique vernacular names, especially in Slavoniclanguages, associated or not with old Greek relation to \u201cchelidon\u201d\u2014the swallow. Typicallyfor Papaveroidae subfamily, yellow-colored latex is produced in abundance and leaksintensely upon injury. Major pharmacologically relevant components, most of which werefirst isolated over a century ago, are isoquinoline alkaloids\u2014berberine, chelerythrine,chelidonine, coptisine, sanguinarine. Modern pharmacology took interest in this herbbut it has not ended up in gaining an officially approved and evidence-based herbalmedicine status. On the contrary, the number of relevant studies and publicationstended to drop. Recently, some controversial reports and sometimes insufficientlyproven studies appeared, suggesting anticancer properties. Anticancer potential wasin line with anecdotical knowledge spread in East European countries, however, in theabsence of directly-acting cytostatic compounds, some other mechanisms might beinvolved. Other properties that could boost the interest in this herb are antimicrobialand antiviral activities. Being a common synanthropic weed or ruderal plant, C. majusspreads in all temperate Eurasia and acclimates well to North America. Little is knownabout the natural variation of bioactive metabolites, including several aforementionedisoquinoline alkaloids. In this review, we put together older and recent literature dataon phytochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical studies on C. majus aiming at a criticalevaluation of state-of-the-art from the viewpoint of historical and folk indications. Thecontroversies around this herb, the safety and drug quality issues and a prospective rolein phytotherapy are discussed as well.Keywords: isoquinoline alkaloids, chelidonine, chelerythrine, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial164Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majusINTRODUCTION\u201cNo less extraordinary is the property of the herb Celandine;which, it is said, if any man shall have this herb, with the heartof a Mole, he shall overcome all his enemies, all matters in suit,and shall put away all debate,\u201d and \u201cif before named herb beput upon the head of a sick man, if he shall die, he shall singanon with a loud voice, if not, he shall weep\u201d; and \u201cit bringeththe business begun to an end,\u201d so wrote Albertus Magnus inthirteenth century A.D. (Best and Brightman, 1999). Nowadays,mankind would definitely benefit from such a miraculousremedy. Unfortunately, such claims about Chelidonium majusL.\u2014the Greater Celandine, have not been verified according tothe modern evidence-based approach (but no data on rigoroustesting toward such properties actually exist in the literature).However, through years of investigations, many other propertiesascribed to this inconspicuous but characteristic plant have beenconfirmed or re-discovered. Several others could not be positivelyconfirmed. Despite the widespread use in folk medicine and inofficial phytotherapy, both in Europe and in Traditional ChineseMedicine, the celandine herb did not join themost popular herbalremedies such as chamomile, valerian, St. John\u2019s wort or ginseng.It has been listed in pharmacopeias and sold in pharmaciesin parallel to the spontaneous collection by people seekingdrugs against gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, infections, butespecially against warts and any skin protuberances. This wasthe reason to combine the available historical and ethnobotanicaldata with the state-of-the art in pharmacology of C. majus andits components in the present review (Supplementary Figure 1).To date, only a couple of papers have provided review ofpharmacological and phytochemical knowledge with the EMAassessment report from 2011 (European Medicines Agency,2011) and the review (Gilca et al., 2010), being the mostrecent and comprehensive ones. Biswas (2013) has publisheda short review with overview of selected bioactivities butonly covering a fraction of available literature and suggestingfuture directions of research. Similar approach to review theC. majus properties was used by Arora and Sharma (2013) whosummarized some activities based on selected literature andincluded pharmacognostic characteristics. Gilca et al. (2010) hasclassified the pharmacological evidence into the categories relatedto traditional usage, also from the viewpoint of the TCM, such asanti-infectious, spasmolytic, gastric and hepatic, and anticancer.They also listed traditional indications that had not beenconfirmed by modern research, such as diuretic, anti-edema,expectorant and antitussive, pulmonary, and ophthalmologicaldiseases. Some current information is also available in herbalbooks and compendia (Wichtl, 2004) or in the Internet. The lattersource is of course difficult to verify.Therefore, we chose to include a possibly high number ofavailable literature, by selecting records from database search(PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar) with the term \u201cchelidonium\u201dor \u201ccelandine\u201d and manually eliminating papers pertaining tofield botany, ecology and other aspects not relevant to medicinaluse of this plant. Some references that have been reviewed earlier(e.g., in Colombo and Bosisio, 1996) were also not cited directlyif the information was redundant. Some information about thehistorical applications and folk medicine in Central and EasternEurope were obtained from sources available in local libraries. Inparticular, we describe the phytochemical composition of variousparts of the plant, the methods used for obtaining extracts andanalysis of the herbal material. Further, we critically summarizethe most credible research on bioactivity and clinical efficacy ofvarious products and substances from C. majus. In addition, thehighly debated and controversial issue of the patented, apparentlysemi-synthetic drug NSC-631570 (Ukrain R\u00a9) promotedmainly asa cancer cure was discussed (Ernst and Schmidt, 2005). With thisreview, we hope to encourage more research and attract interestto this quite common but not always adequately respected weed.BOTANICAL DESCRIPTIONC. majus L. (Papaveraceae1) is a short-lived hemicryptophyte. Ithas up to 1m high stem, branched and sparsely pubescent. Thealternately placed leaves are light bluish at the bottom and greenat the top. The basal leaves are long-petioled, with the obovatedin contour, pinnatosected leaflets with 5\u20137 lobed segments. Theapical leaves are short-petioled, with 3-lobed leaflet. From Aprilto October the plant produces umbellate inflorescences with 2\u20136 flowers, which have 4 bright yellow petals and two whitish,early dropping sepals. The fruit is an elongated (3 cm), pod-shaped, multiseeded capsule, dehiscent with two valves. Theseeds are shiny, ovate and dark brown or black, with elaiosomes.The underground part is a short tap root with numerous andelongated lateral roots. The whole plant contains yellow to orangelatex.C. majus grows in the lowlands and foothills in leafy forests,in brushwood, parks, gardens, on the roadsides and aroundbuildings. It prefers moist soils rich in nitrogen and organicmatter (Zarzycki et al., 2002).Distribution AreaC. majus is native in Europe, western and central part of Asiaand in northern Africa. It occurs from Portugal in the West, toCentral, Eastern to Northern Europe. The Asian range coversTurkey, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Caucasus, and Siberia. InNorth America it is an introduced plant.Taxonomy and NomenclatureUntil the mid-twentieth century the genus Chelidonium L.was monotypic with C. majus L. as the only species. In 1982Krahulcowa based on cytotaxonomic study of C. majus L.sensu lato, proposed to divide the genus into two microspecies.She proposed C. majus L. (2n = 12) distributed in Europe,Siberia, and China and a new species C. asiaticum (Hara)Krahulcova (2n = 10), an East Asian vicariant (Krahulcov\u00e1,1982). Aside from the difference in chromosome numbers anddistribution area, C. asiaticum slightly differs morphologicallyfrom C. majus. It is more hairy, with narrower and sharper leaflobes. Within C. majus she distinguished European C. majus L.subsp. majus with more laciniate lobes of leaves, and C. majus.1The Plant List.

Medicinal properties of C. majus were describedby Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder in the first century AD.Dioscorides in De Materia Medica states that celandine beginsto blossom when the swallows arrive and withers when theydepart. He also refers to a lore saying that swallows restore sightto their blind nestlings with use of celandine (Osbaldeston andWood, 2000). Pliny the Elder repeats these accounts in NaturalisHistoriae (Jones, 1966).The foremost medicinal use of celandine, described since theancient times until the sixteenth century, was treating visualimpairment and eye diseases. For such conditions, Dioscoridesadvised to use herb juice, boiled with honey in a brass vessel.The juice could also be dried in the shade and the resulting smallpellets were ingredients of other medicinal products. Accordingto Dioscurides celandine soaked in wine together with anisefruits was helpful in treating jaundice and dermatologic disorderssuch as herpes. Besides, chewing on a root relieved toothache(Osbaldeston and Wood, 2000). Pliny advised a kind of eyelotion, which takes its name, chelidonia, from the name of theplant (Jones, 1966).Celandine was an admired medicinal plant during the MiddleAges, mostly used to cure eye diseases, for throat cleansing,treatment of ulcers and skin eczema as well as against colicand jaundice (Mayer et al., 2003). In 1080, French monkand physician Odo Magdunensis wrote De viribus herbarum,also known as Macer floridus, a botanical poem describingmedical effects of 77 plants. One of the chapters of M.floridus deals with medicinal application of celandine in \u201cvisualimpairment as well as skin and liver conditions\u201d (Mayer et al.,2003). Hildegard of Bingen wrote about celandine in her workLiber subtilitatum diversarum naturarum creaturarum createdduring 1150\u20131160A.D. and finally published in 1533. Hildegardrecommended celandine juice to enhance sight and juice mixedwith tallow as a cure for skin ulcer (Mayer et al., 2003).Moreover, celandine would be a strong aphrodisiacum, butcausing infertility on ladies. Breathing the smell of the plant byspouses prevents arguments. Celandine was also recommendedby to treat jaundice and against hair overgrowth (Czekan\u00b4ski,2007).Since the sixteenth century, according to Paracelsus\u2019ssignature doctrine, celandine was used to treat jaundice andliver diseases (Rostanski, 1997). C. majus was described incomprehensive botanical medical works of scholars such as:Joannes Minoritanus, Marcello Vergili, Hieronymus Bock,Leonhard Fuchs, Pierandrea Matthioli, and Adam Lonicer.The authors refer to antique sources and recommend usingcelandine to treat eye and skin conditions. According to Lonicer,to cure various dermatologic diseases, known in those days as\u201cleprosy,\u201d the juice of the root of celandine had to be applied onthe skin, conjointly with drinking the juice mixed with syrup ofcommon fumitory (Fumaria officinalis) twice a day for 9 days(Mayer et al., 2003). At the turn of the sixteenth and seventeenthcentury two large works on herbs and their applications werewritten in Poland. The first is Herbarz Polski by Marcin ofUrz \u00b8edowo, printed in 1595 and the second is Herbal by SimonSyrenius, published in 1613. Marcin of Urz \u00b8edowo described,based on works of Dioscorides, uses of celandine to treat eyediseases, jaundice, wounds, toothache, and colic. To cure sightimpairment, herb juice boiled with honey or pellets made ofjuice dried in shade should be used. Cataract, on the other hand,should be treated with juice draining from a broken stem orroot of the plant. In case of jaundice, root of celandine shouldbe boiled in white wine and the decoction should be drunk fora few days. The crashed root with wine was drunk to treat colicand applied on wounds. Applying a piece of root of celandine toan aching tooth, relieved the pain (Marcin of Urz \u00b8edowo, 1595).Simon Syrenius, described celandine-based recipes used ineye diseases. The main ingredient of such medicines is freshcelandine juice. As one of the few authors, Syrenius consideredthe juice irritative and therefore recommended mixing it withsmall amounts of vinegar, milk, or rose water. He also adviseddrinking a decoction of celandine roots cooked in wine withanise or a mixture of powdered root with vinegar before bedtimeto treat jaundice, colic, and stomach ache. In case of toothachehe advised to rub teeth with powdered root with vinegar. Bodyulcers and scabs on the head skin can be cured with a salve ofpowdered rootmixedwith pork fat and vinegar. Alternatively, theFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299166Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majuspowdered root alone could be put directly on the ulcers. Syreniusalso describes the diaphoretic and diuretic effects of the herbalong with the roots or the root itself. The root boiled in wine hasa diuretic effect. As diaphoretic remedy Syrenius recommendedtaking dry bath of celandine herb, which would cause extensivesweating and expulsion of excess water from the body as wellas drinking decoction from roots boiled in rose vinegar orwhite wine with great water dock (Rumex hydrolapathum). Inaddition, the celandine could be used to dye the hair yellow,and to lighten the freckles and hyperpigmentation on the face(Syrenius, 1613).The British Flora Medica (Barton and Castle,1845) cites the traditional applications of C. majus in treatmentof jaundice, visceral obstructions, fevers, dropsies, scrofula,syphilitic a\ufb04iction, gout, cataract, ophtalmia, and specks asdescribed previously by Dioscorides and Galen.In countries, where C. majus is the native species, it becameone of the most widespread drug of folk herbal medicine. Thescope of its applications in folk medicine shows high similarityamong many regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is worthto mention its prevalent application to treat warts, eczemaand other skin diseases, gastrointestinal parasites, jaundice, andliver complaints, inflammatory eye infections and other diseases,including cancer.Skin DiseasesIn folk medicine, C. majus was most commonly used to removewarts. Herb juice or latex were used most frequently for thispurpose, however, use of leaves and flowers was also noted. InPoland it was common to rub the fresh juice from the brokenstem of the celandine onto warts (DeVerdmon, 1936; Kuz\u00b4niewskiand Augustyn-Puziewicz, 1999; Kujawska et al., 2016). In theBieszczady Mountains and in the Podkarpacie Region (S-EPoland) the juice was used directly on warts, or they were firstscrubbed off and then the juice was applied on the wound (Szary,2013). A cataplasm made of flowers that was supposed to bechanged every few days was used in the Kielce Region (CentralPoland) (Szot-Radziszewska, 2012). Occasionally, fresh leaveswere also used (Kujawska et al., 2016). The juice of the aerialpart of the plant was used in the Ukrainian Carpathians (Szary,2010, 2013) and in Russia (Zevin et al., 1997). The herb juicewas applied to treat warts also in the Balkan countries (Red\u017eic\u02c7,2007; Ti \u00b8ta et al., 2009; Menkovic\u00b4 et al., 2011; Mustafa et al.,2012; Koleva et al., 2015) as well as in Central Italy (Menaleet al., 2006) and Great Britain (Barton and Castle, 1845). Otherdermatologic conditions were also treated. All around Polandit was common to apply fresh leaves or juice on wounds. InPodolia (Ukraine) corns were treated by rubbing with a rootof celandine and by application of fresh leaves. After a week,corns softened and ruptured. A salve from celandine, olive oil,fir resin and beeswax was a remedy for pustules (Kujawska et al.,2016). In the Bieszczady mountains (Polish-Slovakian-Ukrainianfrontier), juice of celandine was applied to eczema and cuts, anddecoction of root was used for baths and rinse for dermatologicconditions (Szary, 2013). In the Rzeszowszczyzna (S-E Poland)region leaves were applied to ulcers to stimulate picking up andrupture (Wdowiak and Bielecka-Grzela, 2013). The juice was alsoused to lighten freckles (Kuz\u00b4niewski and Augustyn-Puziewicz,1999). In Russia the juice of aerial parts was used in the treatmentof skin wounds, skin irritation, allergic rashes and dermatitis,leaves, and flowers in the treatment of boils (Mamedov et al.,2004). The aerial parts of the plant were used by the people ofMontenegro to cure blisters, rashes, and scabies (Menkovic\u00b4 et al.,2011). In Central Serbia, juice was applied directly on skin in skineruptions, psoriasis and eczema (Jaric\u00b4 et al., 2007).Liver DiseasesC. majus is one of the best-known folk medicine remedyfor jaundice and liver diseases, such as inflammation, spasticconditions, and gallstones. In Poland, infusion made of youngcelandine leaves was used as a cholagogue and to regulate actionof the digestive tract (Kuz\u00b4niewski and Augustyn-Puziewicz,1999). Jacques (De Verdmon, 1936) in case of jaundice advisedinfusion made of half of a teaspoon celandine per cup. Allaround Poland it was common to bath children with jaundicein celandine and to give celandine infusion to drink (Kujawskaet al., 2016). In the Bieszczady and in the Ukrainian Carpathians,herb infusion was drunk to relieve liver conditions (Szary, 2010).In Western Ukraine, infusion was used as relaxant in colicattacks (Szot-Radziszewska, 2007). Also in Balkan countries,celandine was employed in the treatment of liver disorders. In theAlbanian Alps to treat hepatitis a decoction of fresh aerial partshas been drunk with sugar in small portions\u2014half coffee cup(Pieroni et al., 2005). In Serbia celandine was used internally forinflammation of the gallbladder, bile duct, jaundice, and hepatitis(Jaric\u00b4 et al., 2007; \u0160avikin et al., 2013). The use of celandine issimilar in Gollak region in Kosovo (Mustafa et al., 2012), in theProkletije Mountains (Menkovic\u00b4 et al., 2011) and in Zagori inEpirus, North-West Greece (Vokou et al., 1993).Against Digestive Tract ParasitesPolish name of C. majus \u201cglistnik\u201d (roundworm herb) comesfrom a common traditional usage of this plant to expelroundworms. For this reason decoction of the herb had tobe drunk for 12 days (De Verdmon, 1936). In the BieszczadyMountains children were bathed in decoction of the celandineherb and were given celandine infusion to drink (Szary, 2013).Decoction of seeds was also used in the Kielce Region (Szot-Radziszewska, 2012). In western Ukraine, infusion of the herbwas prepared (Szot-Radziszewska, 2007).Eye DiseasesContrary to ancient phytotherapy, celandine was rarely used totreat eye conditions in folk medicine. Wdowiak (2015) reportsthat in the Podolia Region (Ukraine) drops of celandine juicemixed with vodka were put into eyes. In west Ukraine a tincturemade from celandine was applied. Moreover, a popular beliefamong people of the Podolia Region, as well as the Lubelszczyznaand Podkarpacie Regions (Eastern Poland) said that feces of aswallow can cause sight loss, if they fall into the eye, which canbe only cured by C. majus. In the small town Giby, of Polish-Lithuanian-Belarusian borderland, the celandine pollen was usedagainst eye infections (Kujawska et al., 2017).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299167Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majusOther UsagePeople of S-W Romania and Zagori in Greece were applyingcelandine as diuretic (Vokou et al., 1993; Ti \u00b8ta et al., 2009).In the central Serbia and in Podolia (Ukraine), celandine wasconsidered a remedy for gout. Occasionally, it was used astonic and stimulant of cardiac functions, also increasing bloodpressure (Vokou et al., 1993). In the Bieszczady Mountainspeople incensed aching teeth with the smoke from the burningherb (Szary, 2015). In Poland, juice was used internally to curehydropsy (Kujawska et al., 2016). In Romania it was esteemedas an antidote for snake venom (Ti \u00b8ta et al., 2009). Peopleof Russian descent, called Russlanddeutschen, living in S-WGermany used celandine as depurative (Pieroni and Gray, 2008).Among the Hutsuls living on the Ukrainian side of Bukovina (S-W Ukraine), tea from aerial parts of celandine was employed inthe treatment of cancer (So\u02c7ukand and Pieroni, 2016). In Bosniaand Herzegovina it was used to cure cancer of lungs (Red\u017eic\u02c7,2007). In veterinary treatments, herb decoction was given to cowssuffering from inflammation of the udder, in case of dermatologicconditions animals were rubbed with leaves. Furthermore, cowswere given root to eat to cause vomit to relieve bloat. Besides,herb overcooked in milk was applied to ulcers (Kujawska et al.,2016). In the Bieszczady Mountains celandine was a symbol ofpurification of living world from threatening death, it was used astalismans to protect from demons (Szary, 2015). Dried herb wasused to incense the interiors of huts to deter flies and mosquitosas well as during plague and other epidemics. Grains soaked incelandine juice were used as fish and bird poison (Szary, 2013).PHYTOCHEMISTRYFor the therapeutic purposes, dried herb of C. majus is used(European Pharmacopeia). In some regions (Central and EasternEurope) roots are also exploited. European Pharmacopeiacalls for total alkaloid content as chelidonine [1], assayedspectrophotometrically with additional TLC screening andmicroscopic authentication.AlkaloidsPharmacologically relevant substances of C. majus areisoquinoline alkaloids (Figures 1\u20137, Table 1). These are thecomponents of latex produced in all plant parts, but flowers.Latex is stored in special secretory cells called laticifers. Presenceof articulate laticifers with yellowish content is also used asan authentication microscopic mark in powdered herb bypharmacopoeial monographs. The composition of latex is plantorgan specific (Tome\u00af and Colombo, 1995; Sowa et al., 2018).Generally, five groups of alkaloids were found in C. majus. Theseare the derivatives of phenanthridine (3,4-benzoisoquinoline),protoberberine, protopine [37], quinolizidine, aporphine (Kadanet al., 1990, 1992; Pavao and Pinto, 1995; T\u00e1borsk\u00e1 et al., 1995;Petruczynik et al., 2002; Nec\u02c7as et al., 2005; Sa\u00afrk\u00f6zi et al., 2006;Zhou et al., 2012; K \u00b8edzia et al., 2013; Grosso et al., 2014;Poormazaheri et al., 2017). More than forty alkaloids of differenttypes were isolated and identified from C. majus (Figures 1\u20137).Major phenanthridine derivatives that were found in aerial andunderground parts are (+)-chelidonine [1], chelerythrine [9],(Kadan et al., 1990; Sa\u00afrk\u00f6zi et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2012).Protoberberine derivatives that accumulate in higher amountsare coptisine [31], berberine [28], stylopine [33] (Slavikand Slavikowa, 1977; Fulde and Wichtl, 1994; Shafiee andJafarabadi, 1998; Sa\u00afrk\u00f6zi et al., 2006). Aporphine alkaloidslike corydine [39] also appear (Slavik and Slavikowa, 1977;Shafiee and Jafarabadi, 1998; Kopytko et al., 2005). Twoprotopines were found in C. majus, allocryptopine [36]and protopine [37] (Fulde and Wichtl, 1994; Shafiee andJafarabadi, 1998; Kopytko et al., 2005). Sparteine [38] is theonly representative of quinolizidine alkaloids (Kopytko et al.,2005) but no other publications report its presence. Moreover,new unusual turkiyenine-type alkaloid named (\u2013)-turkiyenine[42] was found in C. majus from Turkey (Kadan et al.,1990).Alkaloid content in different plant organs was found tobe unstable (Kustrak et al., 1982; Tome\u00af and Colombo, 1995).Daily variations were probably due to the alkaloid degradationrather than translocation, because of similar time-course of thecompounds accumulation in all plant parts. Significant increaseof sanguinarine [12], chelerythrine [9], chelidonine [1], andcoptisine [31] was observed during the day, with the highestcontent in the evening, whereupon the alkaloids diminishedduring the night (Tome\u00af and Colombo, 1995). Day light seems tobe the crucial factor influencing alkaloid biosynthesis in C. majus,especially in underground parts of the plants (Kustrak et al.,1982; Tome\u00af and Colombo, 1995). Diurnal changes of alkaloidcontent seem to be less dependent on temperature, what wasobserved during winter time, when the alkaloid content was lowand stable, due to the reduced metabolism and the senescence ofthe aerial parts. According to Tome\u00af and Colombo (1995) totalcontent of alkaloids in leaves was lower than in undergroundparts. In latex the content was 32 times higher than in leavesand 9 times higher than in roots. These results suggest that theamount of alkaloids in plant organs depend on the number oflaticifers in which they are stored. Moreover, the number oflaticifers is probably organ specific. Laticifers in C. majus areunbranched (without anastomoses), articulated with perforatedtransverse cells (Hagel et al., 2008). Articulated laticifers developfrom multiple cells. The structures form longitudinal rowscomposed of series of superimposed cells with perforated endwalls. The type of laticifers can differ even within the sameplant family. In another Papaveraceae species\u2014opium poppy, theperforation of lateral walls leads to the formation of anastomoses(connections) between adjacent laticifer elements, unlike that ofGreater celandine (Hagel et al., 2008). From wounded laticifers, amatrix emerges with various organic substances suspended in it.This excretion is called latex and depending on the plant species,it contains proteins, organic acids, alkaloids, sterols, tannins, andmucilage. The growth and development of laticifers runs close tothe surrounding phloem, which affects the composition of latex.Amajor site of alkaloid accumulation in the protoplast of laticifercells are vesicular organelles, that had been found in opium poppybetween early 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s of the last century (Dickenson andFairbairn, 1975; Roberts et al., 1983). Unfortunately, researchon the site of alkaloid biosynthesis in Greater celandine hasFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299168Zielin\u00b4ska et al.

Recent reports concern proteindetermination in latex and confirm its complex composition(for more information see the separate \u201cProtein subsection\u201dunderneath).The presence and number of laticifers is due to thephysiological functions of aerial parts and underground parts ofthe plant, such as responses to environmental factors, defenseagainst herbivory, metabolic reserves, and energy store (Agrawaland Konno, 2009). Coptisine [31] was found mostly in fruitsand herb (Sa\u00afrk\u00f6zi et al., 2006; K \u00b8edzia et al., 2013; Sowa et al.,2018), whereas berberine [28] showed no significant differencebetween aerial parts and roots (Tome\u00af and Colombo, 1995).Larger amounts of phenanthridine alkaloids like chelidonine [1],chelerythrine [9], sanguinarine [12] were observed in roots ratherFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299169Zielin\u00b4ska et al.

Four diglycosides and fivemonoglycosides were identified as derivatives of kaempferol,quercetin, and isorhamnetin (kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299170Zielin\u00b4ska et al.

Theidentification was based on the mass spectra of the compounds(Grosso et al., 2014). In stems, leaves, and flowers, 5\u2032-methoxy-flavonol [43] and 6\u2032- methoxy-flavonol [44] were also detected(Stancic-Rotaru et al., 2003).Hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic) andtheir derivatives ((\u2013)-2-(E)-caffeoyl-D-glyceric acid [46], (\u2013)-4-(E)-caffeoyl-L-threonic acid [47], (\u2013)-2-(E)-caffeoyl-L-threonicacid lactone, (+)-(E)-caffeoyl-L-malic acid [48]), as well ashydroxybenzoic acids (genistic, p-hydroxybenzoic) wereidentified in aerial parts (Hahn and Nahrstedt, 1993; Wojdy\u0142oet al., 2007). Later, another three hydroxycinnamic acids wereidentified using HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS: caffeoyl threonic acid,caffeoyl glyceric acid, caffeoylmalic acid (Grosso et al., 2014), thathave been detected previously by Hahn and Nahrstedt (1993).Two caffeoyl acid derivatives isomers with precursor ions at m/s359 corresponding to rosmarinic acid were also found in aerialparts (Grosso et al., 2014).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299171Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majusFIGURE 4 | Further structures of minor phenanthridine (3,4-benzoisoquinoline) alkaloids.ProteinsA phytocystatin\u2014chelidocystatin was one of the first proteinsisolated from latex and characterized (Rogelja et al., 1998).Cystatins, a class of thiol protease inhibitors are involvedin defense and stress-response mechanisms and could alsocontribute to the antimicrobial and antiviral activity of C. majuslatex (Benchabane et al., 2010). Whether or not the presenceof cystatin is relevant to the medicinal properties and suchtraditional folk uses as anti-warts is yet to be found out.In a series of papers, Nawrot et al. (2007a,b, 2008, 2013,2014, 2016, 2017a,b) described a number of proteins from rootand leaf latex. Proteomic analysis using LC-ESI-MS/MS systemrevealed the presence of three categories of proteins accordingto their functions: proteins involved in disease and defensesresponses (i.e., superoxide dismutases, lactoylglutathione lyases),nucleic acid binding proteins (i.e., glycine-rich proteins, nucleicacid binding, DNA-binding, or RNA-binding proteins), andthese that are involved in general metabolism (acyl-CoAbinding protein, malate dehydrogenase, flavodoxin-like quinonereductase, ubiquitin, polyubiquitin, serine/threonine proteinkinases, rubber elongation factor). A total of 21 proteins wereidentified in C. majus latex, although in several cases theidentification was based on correlation between experimentaland the theoretical pI/molecular mass, due to their low scoreresults.

Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majusFIGURE 7 | Structures of miscellaneous compounds.METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF ACTIVECOMPONENTS FROM Chelidonium majusAlkaloidsFirst isolation of Chelidonium alkaloids was achieved innineteenth century with an important contribution from Mr.Emanuel Merck\u2019s company at Darmstadt (Henschke, 1888;Schmidt, 1888) and obtaining and characterization of purecompounds (chelidonine [1], chelerythrine [9], protopine [37])was successful in the following years (Selle, 1890; Wintgen andSchmidt, 1901). Alkaloids of C. majus occur as salts or basesdepending on pH of medium; thus, their extraction was mostlycarried out in acidic condition to convert all compounds towater-soluble salts. Methanol or ethanol often with additionof water (Bugatti et al., 1987; Han et al., 1991; Koriem et al.,2013) and hydrochloric (Kursinszki et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2010)or acetic acid (Paulsen et al., 2015) were used as extractants.The isolation from plant material was also achieved with theuse of pure acidified water; further, the solution was alkalizedwith ammonia or sodium hydroxide to obtain base formsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299175Zielin\u00b4ska et al.

The isolation wasconducted by percolation (Capistrano et al., 2015), maceration(Koriem et al., 2013; Borghini et al., 2015), heating under reflux(Gu et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2011; Seidler-\u0141ozykowska et al.,2016), in water bath (Sa\u00afrk\u00f6zi et al., 2006) or Soxhlet apparatus(Bugatti et al., 1987; Stuppner and Ganzera, 1995) as well asultrasound assisted (UAE) (Kursinszki et al., 2006; S\u00e1rk\u00f6zi et al.,2007; Paulsen et al., 2015; Jesionek et al., 2016) or microwaveenergy (MAE) (Then et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2012). Supercriticalfluid extraction (SFE) (Then et al., 2000) or SFE combined withenhanced solvent extraction (ESE) and low pressure solventextraction with water (LPSE) (Ga\u00f1\u00e1n et al., 2016) was alsoapplied. Moreover, in situ solvent formation microextraction(ISFME) with the use of ion-pairing agent (KPF6) and awater-miscible ionic liquid ([C6MIM][Br]) which formed ahydrophobic ionic liquid extraction phase ([C6MIM]PF6) forthe pre-concentration of sanguinarine [12] and chelerythrine[9] was elaborated by Wu and Du (2012). After extraction, thesolution was usually filtrated through a 0.22-\u00b5m membrane (Guet al., 2010) or additionally purified using solid phase extraction(SPE) on C18 cartridge (Stuppner and Ganzera, 1995; Kursinszkiet al., 2006; Sa\u00afrk\u00f6zi et al., 2006). Sa\u00afrk\u00f6zi et al. (2006) developedion-pair SPE with n-heptanesulfonic acid (HS). Dried residueobtained after extraction was dissolved in methanol with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid, diluted with 0.05M aqueous solution of HSand loaded on an SPE C18 microcolumn. Further, 70% HS(0.05M) in methanol was used to remove the matrix and 5%HS (0.05M) in methanol to elute analytes. The examples ofconditions used to isolate alkaloids from C. majus are presentedin Supplementary Table 1.Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)TLC was mostly employed for screening purposes or forqualitative analysis of alkaloid composition in C. majus extracts.This technique has been largely limited to the screening andmultiple sample fingerprinting, but usually does not enable high-sensitivity or high-resolution insight into the minor componentsof the phytochemical profile. Despite of being less intensivelymodernized in comparison to column-based techniques like(U)HPLC, this method is still favored when cost-effectivenessand simplicity of sample preparation is important, for example inherbal industries and educational use. Some recent developmentsin mass spectrometry hyphenation in form of matrix transferor DART (direct analysis in real time) used already in studyingof other species (M\u00f3ricz et al., 2018) should be useful also forC. majus alkaloids.Silica was the most common stationary phase, oftenimpregnated with salts (Ni, Zn, Cr, Co) to improve the selectivity(Wagner et al., 1984; Then et al., 2000; Waksmundzka-Hajnoset al., 2000; Sa\u00afrk\u00f6zi et al., 2006; S\u00e1rk\u00f6zi et al., 2007; Petruczyniket al., 2008; Jesionek et al., 2016) Silica modified with octadecyl(C-18) and cyanopropyl (CN) groups and aqueous solutions ofmethanol or isopropanol with ammonia or diethylamine whichprevented tailing of chromatographic bands were sporadicallyapplied (Petruczynik et al., 2007). Petruczynik et al. (2008)combined various types of stationary phases e.g., cyanopropylsilica with silica or octadecyl silica to obtain adsorbent gradient.Apart from the routine isocratic elution with solventmixtures, using different modes of gradient elution improved theseparation, e.g., as a two-dimensional or unidimensional multipledevelopment (Szumi\u0142o and Flieger, 1999; Waksmundzka-Hajnoset al., 2000; Migas et al., 2012), bivariant multiple development(Bogucka-Kocka and Zalewski, 2017), or stepwise gradientelution (Matysik and Jusiak, 1990; Waksmundzka-Hajnos et al.,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299176Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majus2000; Bogucka-Kocka and Zalewski, 2017). TLC separation ofalkaloids was supported by use of magnetic field (Malinowskaet al., 2017) or forced flow of mobile phase (OPLC\u2014overpressure layer chromatography or optimum performancelaminar chromatography; Pothier et al., 1993; Malinowska et al.,2005).TLC was also applied for direct bioautography (TLC-DB) totest the antibacterial activity of C. majus extracts (S\u00e1rk\u00f6zi et al.,2007; M\u00f3ricz et al., 2015; Jesionek et al., 2016) combined withdensitometry for quantitative analysis (Then et al., 2000; Sa\u00afrk\u00f6ziet al., 2006) and it proved useful as preparative technique forisolation of alkaloids (Waksmundzka-Hajnos et al., 2002; Koriemet al., 2013).High Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC)High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-fast liquid chromatography (UFLC) have been the most oftenapplied analytical techniques. For many years, separation ofC. majus extracts was mostly carried out in reversed phase(RP) system using long (150 or 250mm) C18 columns with4.6mm of diameter and 5\u00b5m of particle size (Niu and He, 1994;Petruczynik et al., 2002; Kursinszki et al., 2006; Borghini et al.,2015; Paulsen et al., 2015; Ga\u00f1\u00e1n et al., 2016). More recently,adsorbents with smaller particles (\u22643\u00b5m) or shorter columns(Prosen and Pendry, 2016; Seidler-\u0141ozykowska et al., 2016) werealso applied to achieve shorter separation and saving solvents.Mobile phases are usually composed of water and acetonitrileor/and methanol with various additives e.g., ammoniumformate/acetate (Borghini et al., 2015; Seidler-\u0141ozykowska et al.,2016), organic amines (triethyl-, tetrabutylamine) (Paulsen et al.,2015), ion-pair reagents (sodiumdodecylsulfate, alkylsulfonicacids) (Ga\u00f1\u00e1n et al., 2016). The additives were necessary to reducepeak tailing forming as a results of interaction of alkaloid cationicforms with residual silanol group of stationary phase. Eluentswere acidified with acetic or formic acid to pH < 4 to avoid theco-occurrence of ionic and uncharged forms.Normal-phase (NP) chromatography set ups were used ratherseldom in analysis of alkaloids. Here, silica columns was elutedwith sodium acetate in methanol, dioxane and acetic acidmixture (Bugatti et al., 1987) or chloroform and methanol withtrifluoroacetic acid (Rey et al., 1993) Also, cyanopropyl stationaryphase was eluted with acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxaneor methanol with phosphate buffer and octane-1-sulfonic acidsodium salt or di-(2-ethyl hexyl) orthophosphoric acid (HDEHP)(Petruczynik et al., 2002).Alkaloids have a strong absorption in UV region andhave ability to fluorescence; thus both spectrophotometricand fluorescence detector (Wu and Du, 2012) were applied.Additionally, ESI-MS and/or NMR were coupled with HPLC toconfirm the identity and structure elucidation of new alkaloids(Paulsen et al., 2015). Moreover, preparative separation ofparticular alkaloids from C. majus extract using silica gel andsequentially elution with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate andmethanol (Yao et al., 2011) or CaCO3 and different compositionsof toluene-hexane and acetone-hexane mixtures (Horv\u00e1th et al.,2010) was performed with use of LC system.Capillary Electrophoresis CECE method with spectrophotometric (DAD) and fluorescencedetection (UV-LEDIF ultraviolet light-emitting diode-inducednative fluorescence or LED-fluorescence) was also used forC. majus analysis (Stuppner and Ganzera, 1995; \u0160evc\u02c7ik et al.,2000; Kulp et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012; Kulp and Bragina, 2013);however, this technique has not yet won high popularity and it isalso limited to charged or polar compounds. Recently, Sun et al.(2015) elaborated the microchip variant of CE with laser-inducedfluorescence detection and 50% formamide as a run buffer andthis technique was applied for separation of chelerythrine [9] andsanguinarine [12]. The examples of application the separationtechniques in analysis of alkaloids from C. majus are presentedin Supplementary Table 2.SpectrophotometrySpectrophotometric method given in European Pharmacopeia(monograph of Greater celandine) may be useful to estimate oftotal alkaloids in C. majus extract. The sample is mixed withsulphuric and chromotropic acid, and heated 10min. at 100\u25e6Cin water-bath. After cooling to 20\u25e6C, the absorption of sampleis measured at 570 nm and the amount of alkaloid is expressedas chelidonine [1]. This approach was applied by (Then et al.,2000; Seidler-\u0141ozykowska et al., 2016). However, for researchpurposes, a total-content approach should be discouraged as tooinaccurate and sometimes misleading about contribution of eachcomponent of an actual alkaloid profile.In summary, most of the published preparative and analyticalapproaches were rather routine and typical for phytochemicalstudies. However, the efficiency of standard methods oftenappeared to be insufficient. The properties that influenced theseparation and analysis processes depend mostly on the tertiaryor quaternary character, oxygenation and secondary cyclizationpattern. Among the most important features are thermo- andphoto-sensitivity, so the procedures should be carried outin mild conditions which has not always been considered.Thus, due to the diversity in physicochemical properties, evenamong compounds from a single subclass, various specializedmodifications were applied which in most cases significantlyimproved the separation.Another issue that should be addressed in future analyticalstudies is that numerous minor alkaloids have been frequentlymissed or overlooked whereas some of them have profoundactivity. The focus should be on comprehensive qualitativeand quantitative profiling under non-destructive conditions thatwould reveal the full phytochemical complexity and allow tounderstand the intraspecific and environmental variation ofC. majus.Other ComponentsCarotenoidsCarotenoids were determined in aerial parts (Varzaru et al.,2015) and flowers (Horv\u00e1th et al., 2010) of greater celandine.The components were hydrolyzed with alcoholic solution ofFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299177Zielin\u00b4ska et al.

(2014) tested different combinations: time,temperature type of extraction, and eluent composition andused Box\u2013Behnken design to establish the effective extractionconditions for phenolic compounds. 76.8% of methanol,150.0min and 60\u25e6C were found to be optimal. Further,hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids were characterized byHPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn (C18 column: 150 \u00d7 1.0mm, 3\u00b5m) andquantified using RP-HPLC DAD (C18 column: 250 \u00d7 4.6mm,5\u00b5m). For both methods, gradient elution with mobile phasecomposed of 1% acetic acid in water and methanol was applied(Grosso et al., 2014). Hence, the method for phenolic analysis issimilar to some which were used for alkaloids and there would bereasonable to include phenolic compounds in any future HPLCor LC-MS profiling of this herb.ProteinsThe composition of proteins in C. majus milky sap was studiedby Nawrot et al. (2007a,b, 2014, 2017a,b). The compounds werepre-separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis andfurther, HPLC on BEH C18 column (100mm \u00d7 100\u00b5m, 1.7\u00b5mparticle diameter) (Nawrot et al., 2017b) or nano-HPLC on75\u00b5m analytical column (Nawrot et al., 2007a, 2014, 2017a) andgradient elution with mobile phase containing 0.1% (v/v) formicacid in water and in acetonitrile were performed. Proteins wereidentified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).Micro and Macro-elementsMineral composition of greater celandine herb and root, aqueoussolutions (infusion, decoction) and alcoholic extracts weredetermined with the use of inductively coupled plasma atomicemission spectrometry (Then et al., 2000; S\u00e1rk\u00f6zi et al., 2005).PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES ANDCLINICAL EVIDENCEObviously enough, the great majority of publishedpharmacological properties of C. majus pertains to thecomplex mixture or individual alkaloids. Recently, moreand more attention has been also paid to proteins from latex, thatcould significantly contribute to the observed activities. Othercompounds, such as various phenolics and chelidonic acid wererarely considered. The versatile pharmacological activities ofcoptisine [31], one of the major constituents of C. majus as wellas the less abundant berberine [28], have been widely describedin the literature but usually as compounds obtained from othersources, such as Coptis (Ranunculaceae) (Tan et al., 2016) orBerberidaceae (Imanshahidi and Hosseinzadeh, 2008).However, these compounds are also contributing significantlyto many of the pharmacological properties of C. majus.From the growing evidence obtained both in vitro andin vivo, with several examples of ex vivo studies on isolatedorgans, it is clear that four types of medicinal properties arepredominating: antimicrobial and antiviral, hepatic and gastric,anti-inflammatory, and finally anticancer. Several other activiteshave been also reported but less extensively.Activites in Vitro and in VivoAntibacterial and AntifungalThe antimicrobial activity of C. majus is attributed mostly tothe alkaloids and flavonoids (Zuo et al., 2008). This kind ofactivity was reported already in the early research on chelidoniumalkaloids, e.g., by Stickl (1928) who proved the bactericidalproperties against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureusand Bacillus anthracis) with chelerythrine [9] and sanguinarine[12] being more potent than chelidonine [1] and berberine [28].In experiments with multidrug resistant bacteria existingin surgical wounds and infections of critically ill patients,C. majus ethanol extract affected Gram-positive bacteria.Ethanolic extracts of C. majus also showed antimicrobial activityagainst Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus,(Kokoska et al., 2002). The complex composition of alkaloidscan manifest wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, arisingfrom different chemical structures of the compounds. Hence,antimicrobial activity of C. majus was also tested with a use ofdifferent solvent extraction. Antibacterial and antifungal testswere performed using 96% methanol extracts from leaves andpetioles of plants grown in nature as well as in vitro shootsand embryos (Ciric\u00b4 et al., 2008). Methanolic extracts wereexamined against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcusluteus, Sarcinia lutea, and S. aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (E.coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enteritidis), plant pathogens\u2014Agrobacterium rhizogenes, A. tumefaciens), and clinically isolatedC. albicans. Both, in vivo and in vitro derived plant materialextracts showed similar bioactivity, with a slight advantage of invitro shoots. Only few extracts were equally active (80 mg/ml)against E. coli, S. enteritidis, and C. albicans, when comparedto the commercially available antibacterial and antifungal drugs(streptomycin, bifonazole, respectively), while the rest of themshowed low or no activity (Ciric\u00b4 et al., 2008).Apart from plant extracts, as it was previously summarizedby Kedzia and Ho\u0142derna-Kedzia (2013), individuallytested compounds showed different antimicrobial activity.Chelerythrine [9] and sanguinarine [12] were significantly morepotent than chelidonine [1] against Gram-positive (S. aureus,S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, B. anthracis), Gram-negative (P.aeruginosa, E. coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella gallinarum,S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri), and acid-fast mycobacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. smegmatis).Moreover, chelerythrine [9] exhibited antimicrobial activityagainst S. aureus and M. smegmatis, while chelerythrine[9] derivatives: 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine [14a], 8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine [10a], dihydrosanguinarine[10], and dihydrochelerythrine [14] were active againstmethicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC50 = 0.49, 0.98, 23.4,46.9\u00b5g/ml, respectively). The strongest activity was presentedby 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine at MIC90 = 1.95\u00b5g/ml,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299178Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majuscomparable to that of vancomycin (2.23\u00b5g/ml) (Zuo et al.,2008). In the ethanol extract of C. majus aerial parts there areseveral other alkaloids that show potent antimicrobial inhibitoryeffect. For instance, berberine [28] was effective against Gram-negative bacteria\u2014Vibrio cholerae and E. coli. It damagedbacterial fimbria, thereby inhibited adhesion to the mucosalsurface (Imanshahidi and Hosseinzadeh, 2008; Wongbutdee,2009).Enzymes included in latex, like extracellular peroxidases,DNases, and lectin-like-active glycoproteins can also exhibitantimicrobial activity. Moreover, chelidocystatines protect plantagainst pests and are among the components of latex whichpresumably contribute to removal of warts resulting from humanpapilloma virus infection (Rogelja et al., 1998; Song et al., 2002;Gerenc\u02c7er et al., 2006; Nawrot et al., 2007b; Ciric\u00b4 et al., 2008).The antifungal activity was tested with the use of plantlatex, and different solvent extracts from aerial and undergroundparts like ethanol/methanol ether, chloroform, acetone, andwater (Kokoska et al., 2002; Kedzia et al., 2003). Chelerythrine[9], sanguinarine [12], chelidonine [1], and their derivativeswere also individually tested against large number of humanand plant pathogenic fungi, i.e., Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger,Candida sp. Cladosporium herbarum, Cryptococcus neoformans,Epidermophyton floccosum, Fusarium sp. Keratinomyces ajelloi,Microsporum sp. Penicillium notatum, Rhodotorula rubra,Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Torlopsis utilis, Trichophyton sp. Theeffect of C. majus extracts on pathogenic fungi was significantlyweaker compared to the effect on pathogenic bacteria. Forexample, the MIC of ethanol and methanol extracts was rangingbetween 1.5 and 8 mg/ml against the most resistant bacteria,whereas the MIC of ethanol herb extract against the mostpathogenic fungi was 20\u201340 mg/ml (Pepeljnjak et al., 2003).Chelerythrine [9], sanguinarine [12] and their derivatives (e.g.,8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine [10a]) were up to several timesstronger than chelidonine [1] (Ma et al., 2000; Meng et al., 2009;Kedzia and Ho\u0142derna-Kedzia, 2013). Chelerythrine [9] was alsoable to inhibit spore germination of several plant pathogenicfungi: Sphaerulina juglandis, Septoria microspora, Fusariumoxysporum, and Curvularia lunata. It suggests the actualbiological\u2014antipathogenic function of isoquinoline alkaloids inthe plant (Wei et al., 2017). However, no particular structuralfeature seems to be pinpointed as a determinant of antimicrobialpotency despite some variation in activity toward different strainsbetween individual alkaloids. It is rather the combination ofthem and other compounds targeting multiple sites of actionthat result in the observed final effect. This hypothesis stillneeds experimental verification for potential synergies or otherinteractions.AntiviralThe glycosaminoglycan present in the latex inhibits intracellularhuman immunodeficiency virus HIV viral migration andblocks reverse transcriptase (Gerenc\u02c7er et al., 2006). Moreover,individually tested five C. majus alkaloids: chelidonine [1],chelerythrine [9], sanguinarine [12], coptisine [31], andberberine [28] were able to inhibit the development of HIV-1. The first two decreased the activity of the virus reversetranscriptase at the concentrations 150\u2013200\u00b5g/ml, whilesanguinarine [12], berberine [28], and coptisine [31] werealready active at concentrations of 50\u2013150\u00b5g/ml (Tan et al.,1991).The chloroform extract in the concentration of 35\u00b5g/mldecreased the number of adenoviruses responsible forinducing acute fevelitis of the upper respiratory tract andconjunctiva in humans (K\u00e9ry et al., 1987). The experimentswith animals showed that ethanol extract of C. majus inhibitedencephalomyocarditis virus in 45% of experimental mice,whereas berberine [28] tested in the concentration rangebetween 20 and 125\u00b5g/ml inhibited influenza virus type A andB in chicken embryos with 33\u201399.97% efficiency (data previouslyreviewed by Kedzia et al., 2003). These results were presentedonly once, and from that time have never been confirmed orrepeated.AntiprotozoalHerb and root water extracts, as well as sanguinarine [12] (2\u20134\u00b5g/ml) were highly effective in the treatment of trichomoniasiscaused by Trichomonas vaginalis. After 8\u201310 days of treatmentthere was no protozoa detected in genitals of nearly 64% younggirl patients. Sanguinarine [12] was also found to inhibit thedevelopment of Entamoeba histolytica, responsible for the hepaticabscess (Kozicka and Radomanski, 1963; Vychkanova et al.,1969).Liver and Biliary TractOne of the most widespread and repeatedly mentionedindications of C. majus, both in European/Mediterranean andEast Asian (TCM) tradition, was for various liver complaints.It may date back to \u201csignatura rerum\u201d rule from coloration ofthe latex and flowers but obviously must have been verified byobservations. Nowadays, even though this indication has beensupported by just a few in vitro and in vivo studies, caution isnecessary for alleged hepatotoxicity. Also, clinical evidence isnot sufficient to ultimately recommend this herb and galenicpreparations thereof (European Medicines Agency, 2011).Some of the hepatoprotective and choleretic/cholagogueactivity could be more aptly attributed to the presence ofhydroxycinnamic (caffeic) acids esters which have been quitefrequently overlooked in alkaloid-focused studies (Weiskirchen,2016).The question whether the supposed stimulation of bile flowis caused only by cholagogue activity or also by increasing bileproduction or excretion was first addressed by Rentz (1947).Comparison of guinea pigs and rats (that do not have gallbladder and did not respond to the treatment) reaction toC. majus tincture suggested only cholecystokinetic mechanismof action, attributed by the author to the stimulation ofsmooth musculature by berberine [28]. However, the tincturecomposition was unknown.Vahlensieck et al. (1995) indicated using isolated rat liversthat beside the earlier reports on cholecystokinetic action, alsoincrease of bile production contributes to the final outcome. Theactivity was not very high, reaching 20% increase by perfusionwith C. majus extract. The activity of alkaloid and polyphenolFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299179Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majusfractions separately were only about half of that. It suggests anadditive action of the complex mixture of all active constituents.The antispasmodic activity of C. majus extract was testedin trials based on acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contraction inisolated rat ileal smooth muscle (Boegge et al., 1996). The extractwas found to be moderate antagonist (12.7%; 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 g/mlorgan bath) against (ACh)-induced contraction compared tocaffeoylmalic acid [48] (6.9%; 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 g/ml) and coptisine[31] (16.5%; 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 g/ml). Also, individual alkaloids, i.e.,chelidonine [1], stylopine [33], and coptisine [31] have beentested for relaxant activity on ileum smooth muscles (Hilleret al., 1998). Among them, chelidonine [1] and stylopine [33]showed papaverine-like musculotropic action, whereas coptisine[31] was ineffective in BaCl2 stimulation model. In carbacholand electric field induced contractions, all three alkaloids andethanolic extracts were effective.In a different contraction model\u2014isolated and perfusedporcine uterus, the commercial alcoholic extract exhibited two-phase response, initially stimulating very strong contractionsfollowed by a longer relaxation period (Kuenzel et al., 2013).These properties were suggested as potentially useful insupporting artificial insemination or facilitating fertilizationby acceleration of sperm movement toward fallopian tubes.However, this indication was rather unknown in traditional usageand would be a novel application of C. majus.CytoprotectiveThe macerated ethanol extract from juice expressed frompulped fresh plant material (according to the homeopathicrecipes) was able to counteract carbon tetrachloride inducedhepatotoxicity (Mitra et al., 1996). The effects of extractadministration included reduced cell necrosis, absence of fibrosis,and lower lipid accumulation. Here again, no reliable data onthe composition of the tested extract was available. C. majusprimary tincture (German Homeopathic Pharmacopeia), diluted100x and 1,000x was significantly effective against cadmium-induced hepatoxicity in HepG2 and primary rat hepatocytemodels (Gebhardt, 2009). The activity was stronger thanthe proprietary compound preparation and similar to therecognized hepatoprotective herb\u2014Silybum marianum. Theputative mechanisms of cytoprotective activity was associatedto oxidative stress relieve as demonstrated by improvementof several parameters such as lipid peroxidation, intracellularReactive Oxygen Species, reduced glutathione (GSH) level, aswell as diminished apoptosis symptoms (nuclei fragmentation,cytochrome C release, caspase 3 activation). Hepatotoxicitycaused by cadmium was also ameliorated in vivo in mice and exvivo in hepatocyte cultures. In mice, administration of 50 or 75mg/kg body weight chelidonine [1], also in form of nanocapsules,improved histopathological picture of livers damaged by Cdtreatment. Also, biochemical parameters such as ALT, AST, andALP activities were lowered to the levels intermediate betweencontrol animals and Cd treated ones. Moreover, the expression ofcell death related genes Bax and Bcl-2 was modulated to the levelscloser to the Cd untreated animals. In all tested hepatotoxicityparameters, nanoencapsulated chelidonine [1] wasmore efficient.It was corroborated with the ca. 1/3 higher distribution ofchelidonine [1] from nanoformulation into the liver tissues.The putative mechanisms relate to alleviation of oxidative stressas revealed by improvement of antioxidant status (lower lipidperoxidation, higher GSH level, and SOD and CAT activities) andvarious cell death and inflammation markers (decreased proteinlevel of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, NF\u03baB, p65, cas-3, iNOS) (Paul et al., 2013).Notwithstanding, the literature evidence supporting beneficialproperties in hepatobiliary disorders from both in vitro, in vivo,or ex vivo studies is still less abundant than case reports onliver toxicity. This, quite surprising disparity, should motivatepharmacologists and clinical researchers to do further and moreinsightful studies to explain the mechanisms of action andpinpoint the most active constituents or their combinations.Antiproliferative, Pro-apoptotic, and Cytotoxicity toCancer Cell LinesAs in case of liver and biliary tract disorders, the antitumorproperties have been indicated since antiquity. Today, this kindof activity belongs to the most intensely investigated. Unlikethe hepatoprotective properties, this kind of properties has beenquite well-documented in a high number of studies. Mostly,some of the major alkaloids are expected to be able to causecell death or stop proliferation of cancerous cells. This is basedon the ability of berberine [28], chelerythrine [9], sanguinarine[12], and to some extent also other alkaloids to intercalateDNA that should interfere with replication and cell division(Philchenkov et al., 2008; Basu et al., 2013; Noureini et al., 2017).However, other mechanisms have been also discovered, albeitmost studies used in vitro experiments on cell lines. Chelidonine[1] appeared to exert its cytostatic activity through interactionswith microtubules and thereby causing cell cycle arrest (Panzeret al., 2001; Havelek et al., 2016a).The selected examples of cell line-based studies on cytotoxicproperties of C. majus and its major alkaloids are summarized inTable 2.In more detail, quite many different, but mostly human celllines were used as model systems (for references see Table 2),representing leukemias (Jurkat with several modifications tostudy certain cell death mechanisms), Raji, MT-4, MOLT-4, HL-60, U-937, HEL-92.1.7, CCRF/CEM, CCRF/ADR5000), coloncarcinomas (Caco-2, HT-29, HCT116, SW480), breast cancer(MCF-7, MDA-MB231), pancreatic cancer (human PANC-1, murine PANC02), lung cancer ((A549, H460), prostatecancer (DU-145), cervical cancer (HeLa), ovarian carcinoma(A2780), liver cancer (HepG2), gastric cancer (SGC-7901),vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (A431), oesophageal squamouscarcinoma (WHCO5), and mouse melanoma (B16F10). Non-cancerous lines, such as lung fibroblasts (MRC-5, WI-38), skinfibroblasts (Hs27) immortalized cells from mice (3T3), greenmonkey (Vero), humans (293N3S, HS-27, HaCaT), or SV-40transformed bronchial epithelium (BEAS-2B) were also used.From most of the published mechanistic studies a cleardistinction can be established between mechanisms ofaction of chelidonine [1] and sanguinarine [12]/berberine[28]/chelerythrine [9].Sanguinarine [12], chelerythrine [9], and berberine [28]possess strong affinity to binding G-quadruplex in telomeresFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299180Zielin\u00b4ska et al.

Its mechanism of action is suggestedto rely on interactions with spindle microtubules leading tocell cyle arrest and mitotic catastrophe, inhibition of ABCtransporters thus abolishing multidrug resistance and finallymodulation of gene transcription (telomerase, cell death-related,cell cycle-controlling). These properties combined with thestronger-acting intercalating alkaloids can make the wholealkaloid fraction a unique multifaceted agent targeting cancercells.For example, El-Readi et al. (2013) demonstrated complexinteraction of chelidonine [1] and alkaloid-rich extract withseveral signaling pathways, including those responsible for cellcycle, cell death, and proliferation. Using microarrays confirmedby RT-PCR data, it was shown that a set of genes associatedwith multidrug resistance (e.g., ABC transporters and CYP) weresignificantly downregulated (from 50% in case of CYP3A4 to99% in ABCG2). On the other hand, caspase-3 and 8 geneswere upregulated (up to 27-fold). These results explain thestrong augmenting of doxorubicin toxicity to resistant Caco-2 and CCRF/ADR5000 cells. Upon low-dose treatment withchelidonine [1] (20\u00b5M), the LC50 decreased from 3.67\u00b5M(Caco-2) and 32.16\u00b5M (CCRF/ADR5000) to 0.42 and 7.4\u00b5M,respectively. Similar results were obtained with an adequateconcentration of extract (5\u00b5g/ml) containing (in decreasingorder) chelidonine [1], coptisine [31], stylopine [33], andprotopine [37] as four major compounds and smaller amountsof other alkaloids. In the more resistant CCRF/ADR5000 cellsthe effect of extract was even stronger than pure chelidonine [1],suggesting that some of the other alkaloids are more efficient P-gp inhibitors. Induction of apoptosis was the major mechanismof cytotoxicity, also supported by increase of caspase activity andannexin staining.These results support the potential of chelidonine [1] (and atleast some other C. majus alkaloids) as ideal agents to overcomeMDR as targeting both transport proteins, metabolic enzymesand pro-apoptotic pathways.The interference of chelidonine [1] with the cell proliferationapparatus was also demonstrated using planarian stem cell model(Isolani et al., 2012) in which the gene expression of mcm2(essential DNA replication factor) or inx-11 (a gap-junctionprotein essential for regeneration) was decreased by 20\u00b5M ofthe alkaloid. The stem cells were affected but not differentiatedpopulations such as neuronal or intestinal.Quite a particular story pertains to the mentioned earlierpatented product referred to as a semisynthetic derivative ofalkaloids\u2014a trimeric structure with thiophosphoric acid moietyconnecting alkaloid molecules. It has been mentioned in theliterature as NSC-631570 or Ukrain R\u00a9. However, one of themajor doubts regarding this product is its chemical identity(Panzer et al., 2000; Habermehl et al., 2006; Jesionek et al.,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299183Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majus2016). Despite the earlier manufacturer claims, it couldn\u2019t bepositively confirmed that it is indeed a thiophosphoric acidcomplex and at least in some batches, it appeared as a richmixture of native alkaloids, that have been identified usingreliable chromatographic and spectroscopic methods.Several papers additionally report cytotoxic activity ofUkrain R\u00a9 on other cell lines such as prostate cancer (LNCaP,PC-3), glioblastoma (T60, T63, primary cancer line), pancreaticductal adenocarcinoma (HPAF-II, HPAC, PL45, renal clear cell orpapillary cell-derived lines (Caki-1, Caki-2, ACHN), melanoma(B16F10) and murine (TUBO, 4T1) or human (SKBR-3) breastcancer (see Table 2 for respective references).However, due to the conflicting data about the chemicalidentity of this product, the previous results would have to berepeated or reinterpreted. If indeed Ukrain R\u00a9 is just a versionof alkaloid mix, all the research done using it as an activesubstance would extend the scope of anticancer properties ofC. majus native alkaloids. One of the early interesting findingsis radiosensitizing influence of Ukrain R\u00a9 (Cordes et al., 2002,2003) and it should be verified using non-modified alkaloid-richextract and individual compounds to find out which of themor a combination would be responsible for this property. Also,other studies reporting UkrainR\u00a9as an active principle need re-evaluation with native alkaloids as probably constituting majorcomponent in the patented preparation. Moreover, Ukrain R\u00a9remains the only preparation from C. majus that has a vastliterature documenting its anti-cancer and also other propertiesin clinical (see the respective section in the present paper),pre-clinical and in vivo studies.Anti-inflammatory and ImmunomodulatingSome of the versatile traditional uses of C. majus can beexplained, as inmany other herbs, by anti-inflammatory potentialtargeting various pathways in the organism as well as modulationof immune response. Both have been confirmed in many studiesusing in vitro cellular models, as well as in vivo.The ability to inhibit inflammation or, in some cases, tostimulate immune response and mitigate excessive reactivenesscan contribute to the postulated anticancer properties andimprove symptoms of gastric disorders as well.Schneider et al. (2016) used human colon cell line (NCM460)to check anti-inflammatory action of composite preparationscontaining C. majusmarketed and popular in Europe and any ofthe individual components. C. majus extract was among the mostpotent in a couple of checked parameters, such as inhibition ofIL-8, MCP, and I-TAC secretion, thus contributing significantlyto the overall and apparently synergistic combination of activeprinciples. This activity was likely to influence the clinicaloutcome mentioned below (Abdel-Aziz et al., 2017).Mostly, the total extracts or isolated alkaloids were tested,but in our opinion, other components such as hydroxycinnamicderivatives, flavonoids and chelidonic acid are likely to contributesignificantly. Chelidonic acid [45] was efficient in mouse modelsof ovoalbumin-elicited allergic rhinitis (Oh et al., 2011) andulcerative colitis (Kim et al., 2012). This compound alsoattenuated inflammatory responses by reducing levels and geneexpression of several mediators and enzymes in colon tissues(COX-2, HIF1\u03b1, PGE2) and in allergic mice (IL-4, IL-1\u03b2, COX-2,caspase-1, and increase of IFN-\u03b3). In human mast cell lineHMC-1 stimulated for inflammatory response by the phorbolester (TPA) and calcium ionophore A23187, chelidonic acid [45]inhibited IL-6 expression by blocking NF\u03baB (Shin et al., 2011).Stylopine [33] added to the cell culture of inlipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages wasinhibiting production of several proinflammatory moleculessuch as nitric oxide, PGE2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 (Jang et al.,2004). Also, iNOS and COX-2 protein levels were lowered.However, the cyclooxygenase activity inhibition was notselective. Chelidonine [1] and 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine[14a] in the same model inhibited NO production and iNOSand COX-2 gene transcription (Park et al., 2011). Theseresults suggest the underlying inhibition of NF\u03baB as potentialmechanism but it wasn\u2019t investigated in this study. However, inHCT-1 colon cancer cell line treated with chelidonine [1], theNF\u03baB activation was blocked by inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 degradationand nuclear translocation of p65 (an NF\u03baB subunit) as well asmitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation by blockingc-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 phosphorylation (Zhang et al.,2018).Alkaloid fraction and sanguinarine [12] were efficient againstcarrageenan-induced rat paw edema but chelerythrine [9]showed lower activity (Lanfeld et al., 1981). However, in the laterstudy by Miko\u0142ajczak et al. (2015), various fractions of waterextract at relatively high doses of 200 mg/kg body weight failed toalleviate the inflammation in the similar model. The crude waterextract treatment actually aggravated the paw inflammation.Conversely, the extracts containing mainly coptisine [31] andchelidonine [1] were effective in hot plate test for antinociceptiveproperties that suggests a supramedullary way of action.Chelerythrine [9] inhibited inflammatory and pain reaction inseveral in vivo and cell models employed by Niu et al. (2011).In vivo, i.p administration of the alkaloid (1\u20135 mg/kg) alleviatedmouse ear edema, rat paw edema, and abdominal constriction(pain reaction). Also, the isolated peritoneal macrophages upontreatment with 0.0001\u20131\u00b5g/ml chelerythrine [9] had dosedependently reduced PGE2 and COX-2 expression.In NC/Nga mice model for atopic dermatitis induced byDNCB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene), the hydroethanolic extractfrom aerial parts alleviated several measures of dermatitissuch as itching behavior and skin severity (Yang et al., 2011).Interestingly, the oral administration at doses of 200mg and 400mg/kg were even more efficient than topical application as 1and 2% smear. The IgE levels were put back to control valuesupon the higher dose oral administration and reduced by about50% after topical treatment. Also, IL-4 and TNF-\u03b1 serum levelswere significantly reduced but remained higher than in controlanimals.In an animal model of ovoalbumine-provoked asthma,chelidonine [1] suppressed eosinophile-mediated inflammation.The activity at the doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg body weight wassimilar to 0.5 mg/kg body weight dexamethasone. Among theseveral monitored parameters such as different pro-inflammatorycell population counts in bronchoalveolar lovage fluid and lungs,IgE, and cytokine protein and transcripts levels, some wereinhibited even stronger than by dexamethasone (total BALF cells,Gr-1+/CD11b+ cells, IL-4), whereas others were inhibited eitherFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299184Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majussimilarly or weaker than the standard drug. It suggests a specificmechanism involving STAT6 and Foxp3 transcription pathways(Kim et al., 2015).Yet another inflammation-based conditionabsent from list of traditional indications, in which C. majus wasfound to be efficient is arthritis (Lee et al., 2007). In the micemodel of collagen-induced arthritis, aqueous-methanol extractat the oral doses of 40 and 400 mg/kg body weight, suppressedprogress of joint damage as well as a set of studied inflammation-related cellular and biochemical parameters. In the higher doseregime, the incidence of arthritis decreased from 100 to <40%during 4 weeks. Cell invasion into lymph nodes, spleen, thymusand synovial fluid was inhibited in all organs, but most markedeffect was in lymph nodes and joints. Among the tested Tcells populations, there was an insignificant decrease of CD4+,CD8+, and CD3e+ cells, but a quite remarkable decrease ofCD19+ B cells, almost to the level of non-arthritic animals.On the other hand, the number of regulatory CD4+CD25+T cells increased significantly that suggests mobilizing adaptiveresponse of the immune system to counteract and balance theexcessive inflammatory processes. Suppression of inflammationmediators such as IL-6, TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3 was observed as well aslowered level of IgG and IgM but the latter only upon the higherdose treatment. However, the extract was not standardized an noparticular compound or phytochemical class could be pinpointedas determining this potent anti-arthritic action.A couple of reports indicate a potential of C. majusagainst Alzheimer\u2019s progression due to significant inhibitionof acetylcholinesterase (AChE) without influence onbutyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), which is a desired profilefor potential drug-likeliness. The extract inhibited AChE in vitroby 98% at a concentration of 200\u00b5g/ml and BuChE by only 13%.The isolated alkaloid 8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine [10a] wasthe most active and AChE-selective (IC50 0.61\u00b5M and selectivityindex 56.7) (Cho et al., 2006). In another study, chelidonine[1] and other active alkaloids were completely unselective withsimilar IC50 values against AChE and BuChE (Cahl\u00edkov\u00e1 et al.,2010). Interestingly, the specific AChE inhibiting activity bycoptisine [31]-rich extract was discovered in vivo in a herbivoreinsect Lymantria dispar in which this activity contributes tokilling the pest (Zou et al., 2017). By this property the plant isprotecting itself from herbivore attack and it would be a feasiblebiological explanation of the therapeutic potential existence inthe wild growing species.The analgetic properties of alkaloids, mentioned before(Miko\u0142ajczak et al., 2015) can be explained by the observationsof interaction with glycine transporters (Shin et al., 2003;Jursky and Baliova, 2011). The water extract inhibited theglycine-activated and enhanced glutamate-activated ion currentin isolated rat periaqueductal gray (PAG) neurons studied bypatch-clamp technique (Shin et al., 2003). Chelerythrine [9] andsanguinarine [12] selectively inhibited GlyT1 (but not GlyT2)in the micromolar concentrations (5\u201310\u00b5M) while berberine[28] showed no inhibition in transfected HEK293T cells. GlyT1inhibition was time-dependent, noncompetitive and increasedwith glycine concentration. Interestingly, chelerythrine [9] effectwas reversible while sanguinarine [12] persisted through washingout (Jursky and Baliova, 2011).Clinical StudiesQuite typically for many traditionally used medicinal plants, theclinical evidence of efficacy remains scarce and C. majus is noexception. Therefore, the relatively numerous pharmacologicalstudies need rigorous verification by properly designed andsupervised clinical studies. At present, most of the allegedlycurative properties toward some important complaints remainunconfirmed, even if there is strong pre-clinical evidence. Themillennia long tradition of use becomes confirmed in a significantpart even if some mythical indications turned out to be invalidor perhaps have been misunderstood or distorted when passedthrough generations of practitioners and authors.Several clinical studies exist on the compound preparationSTW-5 containing 10% of C. majus herb extract (Drug-to-Extract Ratio = 1:3) as one of nine ingredients. The gastricdisorders are the main indications and was evidenced bothclinically and pharmacologically (Von Arnim et al., 2007; Abdel-Aziz et al., 2017). Certainly, there is no proof that C. majus wasthe essential ingredient in this preparation but the functionaldyspepsia/postprandial distress syndrome it seems to be oneof the most active (Abdel-Aziz et al., 2017) influencing acidregulation and antrum contraction as well asmoderatemitigationof inflammatory reactions. The mechanisms behind these effectswere also studied in vitro using cell lines showing anti-inflammatory activity (Schneider et al., 2016). IFN-\u03b3 dependentstat1 phosphorylation was postulated as a putative mechanism ofaction in which C. majus extract was among the averagely active,but apparently the whole composition had superior propertiessuggesting synergistic rather than additive effect.A series of older clinical trials were performed on aproduct containing C. majus extract to test the efficacy inpatients with bile tract and gall bladder complaints and gallstones. These studies, reviewed in detail in the EMA report,suggest significant improvement of many clinical parameters.These included: subjective complaints (pain attacks, feelingof fullness), physician\u2019s examination (sonography of gallbladder and liver, liver palpation, meteorism, jaundice) andlaboratory tests (bilirubin, transaminases, blood sedimentation).The patient conditions in which the preparation containingC. majus alkaloids (in daily doses of ca. 0.2mg alkaloid sumas chelidonine [1]) was administered with positive outcomewere for example: cholelithiasis, cholangitis/cholecystitis, post-cholecystectomy, and alcohol toxic liver damage. In the entirearea of gastrointestinal/hepatic complaints, one can estimate thenumber of human subjects involved in to date published clinicalliterature as exceeding 1,500.An impressive number of studies suggest antitumor propertiesof the apparently semisynthetic product\u2014UkrainR\u00a9that showedefficiency in several in vitro studies on an assortment of neoplasticand non-transformed cell lines (Capistrano et al., 2015) but it bylarge failed to demonstrate clinically relevant activity in humans.Several case reports have been published that suggest its beneficialaction in a range of malignancies, such as melanoma, metastaticbreast cancer, various carcinomas.The randomized clinical trials (RCTs) using Ukrain R\u00a9 werereviewed over a decade ago (Ernst and Schmidt, 2005) with aconclusion that despite the intensive publishing activity of severalFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299185Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majusgroups testing Ukrain R\u00a9 against miscellaneous malignacies withvery promising outcome, most of these data are full ofshortcomings that prevent unequivocal credibility. Since then,only a few more studies have been realized but it is still far fromdefinite resolving of this issue, especially in the situation that thechemical analyses, some of which were even co-authored by theinventor (Jesionek et al., 2016) proved that it is not the compoundwhich was initially claimed.Most of the RTCs published were full of inconsistencies oreven appeared unreliable due to the insufficient informationregarding the methodology. Despite the spectacular results insuch malignancies as pancreatic or terminal colorectal cancer,serious doubts remain about the evidence provided in some ofthese trials. Some of the studies are so poorly documented that itwould undermine the validity of the results. For example, missingor suspect randomization method, missing methods for tumordimensions measuring, unclear protocols, subjective outcomeevaluation, lack of proper statistics. Also, a great majority of theclinical trials and case reports were published in one journal.Nonetheless, these few reports on Ukrain R\u00a9 remain the onlyavailable clinical data focusing specifically on C. majus andstrongly suggesting extraordinary antitumor potential.Since the potential conflicts of interest, reliability of theclinical and chemical data of this product have been disputedrepeatedly (Farrugia and Slevin, 2000, 2001; Nowicky, 2001; Ernstand Schmidt, 2005), more studies are indeed mandatory also inthis aspect of C. majus as a source of highly potent substanceswith multidirectional mechanisms of action. Nonetheless, itshould be borne in mind that approval of an extract/mixturebased drug for clinical practice in such a sensitive field asoncology is highly improbable at the moment, and most likelyit would remain so in the near future. Thus, further studies aremandatory that would focus on using individual alkaloids aslead structures for drugs that would target multiple anticancermechanisms. On the other hand, clinical data on efficacy ofvarious C. majus products used in complementary or adjuvanttherapy may facilitate the tedious process of drug developmentwithout changing the existing paradigm of chemotherapybased on combination of chemically defined substances. Quitedifferently from the relatively safe (with limitations describedbelow) gastrointestinal and cutaneous indications, the cautiouspolicies of EMA and other agencies demonstrated in caseof declared anticancer actions are reasonable and should becontinued.Toxicology and Safety IssuesRepeatedly, studies and case reports occur that suggest hepaticinjury/hepatotoxicity. It is especially important because one ofthe main indications of C. majus relates to liver and biliarytract disorders due to its cholagogue and hepatoprotectiveactivities. The incidence of hepatotoxic cases and the possibleclinical importance and safety issues have been reviewedrecently (Pantano et al., 2017). Specifically, the results fromanimal studies are ambiguous and suggest a rather complexmixture of various mechanisms, such as inducing or alleviatingoxidative stress or modulation of hepatic enzymes such asMAO and SOD, or slowing down mitochondrial respiration.The mitochondrial toxicity was related to DNA intercalatingproperties of sanguinarine [12] and chelerythrine [9].In humans, numerous reports have been recorded since the1990\u2019s. The main symptoms included cholestasis and mild tosevere liver impairments with quite well documented causality ina majority of cases. In total, over 50 such cases have been reportedfrom Europe, mostly from Germany (Etxenagusia et al., 2000;Stickel et al., 2003).However, no certain constituent has been directly linked to thetoxicity of the herb. On the contrary, it has been suggested thatdrug interactions rather than intrinsic toxicity are responsible forreported cases. Also, individual hypersensitivity or allergy has tobe considered. Latex contained in the fresh plant is also possiblymore toxic or allergenic than the dried material (EMA report,2011).In an in vitro study on HepG2 cells treated with varioussolvent extracts (Orland et al., 2014), the biotransformationand toxicity-related gene expression was enhanced, butthe dichloromethane extract richest in chelidonine [1] andtotal alkaloids was the weakest inducer and least cytotoxic,whereas ethanolic extracts containing more coptisine [31] andsanguinarine [12] were more cytotoxic. However, the in vivorelevance of these results is uncertain. In rats, the high doses (upto 3g/kg body weight; Mazzanti et al., 2009) did not elicit anysymptoms of hepatic injury and did not alter liver function.Despite proven interaction of sanguinarine [12] and otheralkaloids with DNA, no genotoxicity was observed using wellestablished methods such as Ames tests or in vivo DNA damage(EMA report, 2011).Nonetheless, uncontrolled internal use of unstandardizedpreparations should be discouraged and appropriatepharmacovigilance measures should be implemented to preventunnecessary complications following C. majus administration.The comprehensive pharmacotoxicological investigation is alsoneeded and should encompass establishing toxic doses range ofvarious forms and preparations as well as individual constituents.The European Medicine Agency therefore published thefollowing recommendation:\u201cTwo possible therapeutic indications were proposed for themonograph:Traditional herbal medicinal product:1) For symptomatic relief of digestive disorders such asdyspepsia and flatulence (oral intake)2) For treatment of warts, callus and corns (cutaneous use)\u201d(EMA, 2011).However, based on the reported undesirable effects, includingcases of liver damage, special precautions are necessary, especiallyduring pregnancy and lactation, people suffering from liverdiseases or taking liver-damaging drugs.CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOKSMuch effort has been put into the recognition of bioactivecompounds contained in the extracts of C. majus and themechanisms of their action. Numerous reports have beenFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299186Zielin\u00b4ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majuspublished about its effectiveness in treatment of different medicalcomplaints, such as gastrointenstinal and hepatobiliary disordersor cutaneous ailments caused by a microbial or viral infection.Next to the huge number of scientific reports indicating thebeneficial effect of C. majus, information about its potentialtoxic properties emerged. The use of herbal remedy carriesthe risk of adverse effects, which is why it is important toknow the raw material. Official recommendations do not excludethe use of C. majus as traditional herbal medicinal product.Therefore, further research on the mechanisms of action duringtreatment should be carried out. It is also important to controlthe phytochemical composition of the raw material both inconventional growing conditions and in vitro cultures. The moreso, because the potential risk of carcinogenesis and hepatotoxicityis still not well documented.Finally, we conclude that the millenia long history ofChelidonium in folk, traditional, and official medicine is far fromcoming to the end. On the contrary, recent years witnessed arevival of advanced pharmacological andmechanistic approachesusing both native complexes and individual components indiscovery of the therapeutic potential of this herb. We arequite convinced that in the near future, at least some ofthe already known and evidence-based properties should andwould find their place in officially recognized therapeuticprocedures. Moreover, new discoveries should broaden the scopeof traditional usage and deliver better preparations, especiallycombining different classes of active molecules such as proteins,alkaloids, chelidonic acid, and perhaps also polyphenols. Toachieve it, much more joined and interdisciplinary efforts arenecessary. Further, the plant\u2019s diversity on different levels must bethoroughly evaluated and optimal combination of the complexprofile should be established for various target applications. Asone of the oldest proverbs from Aristotle\u2019s book, also referringto C. majus original Greek name, \u201cone swallow does notmake a spring,\u201d even if we observe a lot of \u201cfirst swallows,\u201dwe urgently need more, to ensure rational exploitation ofthe huge potential hidden in the inconspicuous and commonweed.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSSZ: Wrote phytochemical and bioactivity parts of the manuscriptand critically reviewed and corrected the final manuscript;AJ-D: Wrote the ethno botanical and historical section of themanuscript; MW-K and IS: Contributed to the phytochemicaland analytical parts of the manuscript; AJ: Contributed tothe antimicrobial activity section of the manuscript; AM:Developed the entire concept of this review, wrote bioactivity andpharmacology sections, and critically read and corrected all partsof the paper.FUNDINGThe scientific activity of Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plantsis supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Educationof Poland, grant No. 215259/E-394/SPUB/2-16/1.

All. have been used in traditional medicinefor different conditions related to the spasm of the gastrointestinal system. However,there have been no experimental studies to support the smooth muscle relaxant effectof this plant. The aim of our research was to assess the effects of the hydroethanolicextract of Roman chamomile, its fractions, four of its flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin,hispidulin, and eupafolin), and its essential oil on smooth muscles. The phytochemicalcompositions of the extract and its fractions were characterized and quantified byHPLC-DAD, the essential oil was characterized by GC and GC-MS. Neuronally mediatedand smooth muscle effects were tested in isolated organ bath experiments on guineapig, rat, and human smooth muscle preparations. The crude herbal extract induced animmediate, moderate, and transient contraction of guinea pig ileum via the activationof cholinergic neurons of the gut wall. Purinoceptor and serotonin receptor antagonistsdid not influence this effect. The more sustained relaxant effect of the extract, measuredafter pre-contraction of the preparations, was remarkable and was not affected by anadrenergic beta receptor antagonist. The smooth muscle-relaxant activity was found tobe associated with the flavonoid content of the fractions. The essential oil showed onlythe relaxant effect, but no contracting activity. The smooth muscle-relaxant effect wasalso detected on rat gastrointestinal tissues, as well as on strip preparations of humansmall intestine. These results suggest that Roman chamomile extract has a direct andprolonged smooth muscle-relaxant effect on guinea pig ileum which is related to itsflavonoid content. In some preparations, a transient stimulation of enteric cholinergicmotoneurons was also detected. The essential oil also had a remarkable smooth musclerelaxant effect in this setting. Similar relaxant effects were also detected on other visceralpreparations, including human jejunum. This is the first report on the activity of Romanchamomile on smooth muscles that may reassure the rationale of the traditional use ofthis plant in spasmodic gastrointestinal disorders.Keywords: Roman chamomile, Chamaemelum nobile, Asteraceae, organ bath experiment, gastrointestinalpreparations, spasmolytic effect, contractile actionFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 323193fphar-09-00323 April 4, 2018 Time: 18:30 # 2S\u00e1ndor et al. Spasmolytic Effect of Roman ChamomileINTRODUCTIONChamaemelum nobile (L.) All. (Asteraceae), widely knownas Roman chamomile, is a perennial herb native to South-Western Europe, but it is cultivated as a medicinal plantall over Europe and in Africa as well. Dried flowers of thecultivated, double-flowered variety of the species are official inthe European Pharmacopoeia (European Pharmacopoeia, 2008).Incorporating the plant in traditional herbal medicinal productshas been acknowledged by the European Medicines Agency. Thecomminuted herbal substance (as tea) and a liquid extract ofthe plant (extraction solvent: ethanol 70% v/v) may be used forthe symptomatic treatment of mild, spasmodic gastrointestinalcomplaints including bloating and flatulence. The British HerbalPharmacopoeia indicates its use as carminative, anti-emetic,antispasmodic, and sedative (British Herbal Pharmacopoeia,1971).Roman chamomile (RC) has been used as a medicinal plantfrom the middle ages. The cultivation of the plant started inEngland in the 16th century (Hiller and Melzig, 1999). Thedouble variety of the flower, which now serves as the maincommercial drug, has certainly been known since the 18thcentury (Evans, 1989). The plant gained the name \u201cnobile\u201d(Latin, noble) to illustrate its superior therapeutic efficacy overMatricaria recutita L. (German chamomile) (Hiller and Melzig,1999). The plant was first listed in the Pharmacopoeia ofW\u00fcrttemberg (1741) as a carminative, painkiller, diuretic, anddigestive aid (Lukacs, 1990). In the folk medicine of differentregions of Europe, RC has been used for numerous conditions,including dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea and vomiting, anorexia,vomiting of pregnancy, dysmenorrhoea, and specifically forgastrointestinal cramps and flatulent dyspepsia associated withmental stress (Augustin et al., 1948; R\u00e1p\u00f3ti and Romv\u00e1ry, 1974;Melegari et al., 1988; Rossi et al., 1988; Bradley, 1992). Inthe Mediterranean region, RC tea is consumed to improveappetite and also after meal to prevent indigestion (Rivera andObon, 1995; Menendez-Baceta et al., 2014; Alarc\u00fcn et al., 2015).Traditional use of RC is largely related to its supposed smoothmuscle-relaxant activity.The majority of the secondary metabolites described from theplant belong to the aliphatic esters (essential oil) (Fauconnieret al., 1996), sesquiterpene lactones (Bisset, 1994) and flavonoids(Herisset et al., 1971, 1973; Abou-Zied and Rizk, 1973; Piettaet al., 1991). The polysaccharide content of the dried floweris noteworthy, 3.9% (Lukacs, 1990). The supposed smoothmuscle-relaxant activity of the plant might be attributed to itsflavonoid content. Apigenin and luteolin possess remarkablesmooth muscle relaxant effects on guinea pig ileum (Lemmens-Gruber et al., 2006).Although several studies on the bioactivities of RC areavailable, the majority of these studies were carried out usingthe essential oil, which is not used medicinally, or the observedactivities are not related to the traditional use of the plant. Severalstudies demonstrate the antimicrobial effects of RC essential oilagainst different bacterial and fungal strains (H\u00e4nsel et al., 1993;Piccaglia et al., 1993; Chao et al., 2000; Bail et al., 2009), andantifungal activity was demonstrated also for the aqueous extractsof RC (Magro et al., 2006). The anti-inflammatory capacity andheat shock protein modulating effects of the flavonoids apigeninand quercetin, as well as the anti-inflammatory activities of\u03b1-bisabolol, guajazulene, and chamazulene have been reportedin preclinical studies (Viola et al., 1995; Baghalian et al., 2008,2011; Hern\u00e1ndez-Ceruelos et al., 2010). The polysaccharides ofRC exerted antiphlogistic effect in vivo (Lukacs, 1990).Although the use of RC extract for gastrointestinal problemsseems to be related to its presumptive smooth muscle-relaxanteffect, interestingly no in vitro or in vivo studies have beencarried out so far to assess this bioactivity. However, in anin vitro study an aqueous extract of C. nobile was demonstratedto induce a vasorelaxant effect through the NO-cGMP pathway orpossibly through a combination of Ca2+ channel inhibition plusNO-modulating and phosphodiesterase inhibitory mechanisms.After the oral administration of RC aqueous extract, significanthypotensive effect was observed in an animal study onspontaneously hypertensive rats (Zeggwagh et al., 2009), whichmay be related to the flavonoid content of the plant (Jouad et al.,2001). The clinical efficacy of orally applied preparations has notbeen studied yet, only the effects of external application (Schraderet al., 1997) and aromatherapeutic use (Wilkinson et al., 1999)have been reported.The aim of the current study was to assess the effects ofa hydroethanolic RC extract, its fractions and essential oilon gastrointestinal and urogenital smooth muscles, includingpreparations of human jejunum, in order to clarify the rationalefor the use of this plant for smooth muscle relaxation.Experiments were carried out with an extract conforming to themonograph of the European Medicines Agency (see in section\u201cPreparation of Herbal Extracts and Isolation of ReferenceStandards\u201d), and also with the fractions of this extract and withthe essential oil of the plant.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant MaterialRoman chamomile flowers were purchased from P\u00e1l Bobvos(Hungary). The identity of the plant material was confirmedaccording to the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia.A voucher specimen is stored for verification purposes in theherbarium of the Department of Pharmacognosy, Universityof Szeged. RC essential oil was purchased from Aromax Ltd.(Hungary).ChemicalsFor the pharmacological experiments the following drugs wereused: atropine sulfate (Sigma), \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP lithiumsalt (Tocris), capsaicin, histamine dihydrochloride, indo-methacin, isoprenaline hydrochloride, NG-nitro-L-arginine,papaverine hydrochloride, prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (Sigma),methysergide (Sandoz), (\u00b1)-propranolol hydrochloride(Sigma), pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2\u2032,4\u2032-disulfonic acidtetrasodium salt (PPADS), tetrodotoxin (Tocris), 8-amino-7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxan-5-carboxylic acid,1\u2032-butyl-4\u2032-piperidinylmethyl ester (SB204070), N-(1-azabicycloFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 323194fphar-09-00323 April 4, 2018 Time: 18:30 # 3S\u00e1ndor et al. Spasmolytic Effect of Roman Chamomile[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-6-chloro-4-methyl-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine-8-carboxamide hydrochloride (Y25130) (all fromTocris). For dissolving and diluting of these drugs the followingsolvents were used: 96% ethanol for capsaicin, indomethacin,and prostaglandin F2\u03b1, DMSO for SB204070 and isotonic NaClsolution for the rest of the drugs. Solutions in organic solventswere administered at a maximum of 1 \u00b5l/ml, aqueous solutionsat 1 or 3 \u00b5l/ml bathing solution.Millipore Direct-Q UV3 clarifier (Molsheim, France) was usedto produce purified water for the HPLC measurements. Methanoland ethanol (LiChrosolv R\u00a9 HPLC grade) was obtained fromMerck (Darmstadt, Germany). For chromatographic separation,polyamide (ICN Polyamide for Column Chromatography),Sephadex LH-20 (25\u2013100 \u00b5m, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals), SiO2(Silica gel 60 G, 15 \u00b5m, Merck), and SiO2 plates (20 cm \u00d7 20 cmSilica gel 60 F254, Merck) were used.Preparation of Herbal Extracts andIsolation of Reference StandardsFor the pharmacological experiments, RC crude extract wasprepared according to the description of the European MedicinesAgency monograph (EMA-HMPC, 2012). Ten grams of plantmaterial was extracted with 70% EtOH (3\u00d7 100 ml) via ultrasonicbath, evaporated in vacuum and lyophilized (yield, 3.169%). Partof the RC crude extract was fractionated to gain RC extractfractions with different compositions for further experiments.Vacuum liquid chromatography on polyamide with elution byMeOH-H2O (20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 100:0) was used to gainfractions from the crude extract as follows: F20, F40, F60, F80,and F100.From the methanolic extract of 200 g RC flowers, four markercompounds (used as reference standards in further experiments)were isolated using medium pressure liquid chromatography(SiO2 as stationary phase), gel chromatography (SephadexLH-20), preparative HPLC (RP), and preparative TLC (SiO2).The purity and identity of these compounds were analyzedby NMR. NMR spectra were recorded in MeOD on a BrukerAvance DRX 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland)at 500 MHz (1H) or 125 MHz (13C).HPLC ExperimentsHPLC experiments were carried out on a Shimadzu LC-20ADLiquid Chromatograph (SPD-M20A diode array detector,CBM-20A controller, SIL-20ACHT autosampler, DGU-20A5Rdegasser unit, CTO-20AC column oven) using a Kinetex 5 \u00b5mC-18 100A (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm) with a gradient of 0,01%trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (A) and acetonitrile (B) as follows:0\u20135 min 25% B, 14 min 28% B, 15 min 70% B, 16 min70% B, 16.5 min 25% B, and 20 min 25% B. The flow was1.2 ml/min, column oven temperature was 55\u25e6C. Detection wascarried out within the range of 190\u2013800 nm. For quantification,chromatograms were integrated at 344 nm. The referencestandards and the evaporated extracts were dissolved in MeOH,filtered through a PTFE syringe filter and injected in volumes of5 or 10 \u00b5l. Calibration curves were established for all the fourreference standards.GC and GC-MS ExperimentsThe GC analysis was carried out with an HP 5890 Series II gaschromatograph (FID), using a 30 m \u00d7 0.35 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5mHP-5 fused silica capillary column. The temperature programranged from 60\u25e6C to 210\u25e6C at 3\u25e6C min\u22121, and from 210\u25e6C to250\u25e6C (2 min hold) at 5\u25e6C min\u22121. The detector and injectortemperature was set to 250\u25e6C and the carrier gas was N2,with split sample introduction. Quantities of the individualcomponents of the essential oil were expressed as the percent ofthe peak area relative to the total peak area from the GC/FIDanalysis.The GC-MS analysis was performed with a Finninan GCQion trap bench-top mass spectrometer. All conditions wereas above except that the carrier gas was He at a linearvelocity of 31.9 cm s\u22121 and the capillary column was DB-5MS(30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m). The positive ion electronionization mode was used, with ionization energy of 70 eV, andthe mass range of 40\u2013400 amu.Identification of the compounds was based on comparisonswith published MS data (Adams, 2007) and with a computerlibrary search (the database was delivered together with theinstrument) and also by comparing their retention indiceswith literature values (Adams, 2007). Retention indices werecalculated against C8\u2013C32 n-alkanes on a CB-5 MS column(Kovats, 1965). A mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons was injectedin hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) by usingthe same temperature program that was used for analyzing theessential oil.Guinea Pig and Rat PreparationsGuinea pigs (short-haired, colored, 350\u2013450 g) or Wistar rats(220\u2013300 g) of either sex were killed by a blow to the head andexsanguination. Three centimeter segments of the ileum or distalcolon were placed into the organ bath in a vertical position, undera constant tension of 7 mN. Longitudinal strip preparations(approximately 2\u20133 cm in length) of guinea pig urinary bladderor rat gastric fundus were fixed under a tension of 5 mN.This study was carried out in accordance with Universityguidelines. The protocol was approved by the Animal WelfareCommittee, University of P\u00e9cs (registration number, BA02/2000-1/2012) with the understanding that isolated organ studies afterstunning the animal cannot be regarded as animal experiments.Organ Bath ExperimentsSmooth muscle preparations were used in a traditional organbath arrangement. The preparations were suspended in Krebs\u2013Henseleit solution of 5 or 7 ml, kept at 37\u25e6C, and aerated witha mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The solution contained119 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mMMgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, and 11 mM glucose(pH = 7.4). Movements of the preparations were recorded withisotonic transducers (Hugo Sachs Elektronik-Harvard Apparatus,March, Germany) on ink writers or stored online on a personalcomputer.The guinea pig ileum is a preparation of a low spontaneoustone. In part of the experiments the effects of RC extract,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 323195fphar-09-00323 April 4, 2018 Time: 18:30 # 4S\u00e1ndor et al. Spasmolytic Effect of Roman Chamomileits fractions, essential oil, or flavonoids were studied at basaltone. All experiments commenced with determining the maximallongitudinal spasm by adding histamine (10 \u00b5M) to the organbath for 2 min. This response served as reference for determiningthe relative amplitude of any contractile effect that the samples tobe tested might have had.In another set of experiments the possible relaxant effect of thematerials was tested. For this reason, a tonic, approximately half-maximal contraction of the ileum was provoked by a moderateconcentration of histamine (0.5 \u00b5M, added for 15 min). Inpreliminary experiments, no pretreatment was used. In the bulkof the experiments, however, the muscarinic receptor antagonistatropine, as well as tetrodotoxin, an inhibitor of nerve axonalconduction (blocker of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels) wasadded prior to the histamine administration. This was done toavoid the interference with a possible contractile effect of thematerial to be examined, i.e., to create a methodologically clearsituation.All experiments commenced after an equilibration periodof 45 min. Relaxant effects were studied on pre-contractedpreparations (see below). Maximal spasm of the tissue was evokedto serve as a basis for the comparisons to evaluate the responsesobtained by our test materials. The materials examined wereadministered in a single concentration (i.e., in a non-cumulativemanner).Human Jejunal PreparationsMacroscopically intact segments of human jejunum, removedduring the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer were used.Strips of either longitudinal or circular orientation were prepared(the mucosa and submucosa were removed) and fixed asdescribed above, under a tension of 10 mN. Freeze-dried extractsof RC, as well as the essential oil of the plant were mixed in andfurther diluted with DMSO. The amounts of DMSO administeredto the jejunum preparations are indicated in the Section \u201cResults\u201d.This study was carried out in accordance with the Declarationof Helsinki and the guidelines set by the Research EthicsCommittee, Scientific Council of the Ministry of Health,Hungary. This Committee agreed to the use of discardedhuman tissue for the experimental work. The protocol wasapproved by the ETT-TUKEB (Scientific Council of the Ministryof Health, Research Ethical Committee) [No. 17861-0/2010-1018EKU (749/PI/10)]. All subjects gave written informedconsent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Statistical AnalysisResults of the pharmacological experiments are given asmean \u00b1 SEM, with N denoting the number of preparationsused for testing efficacy. At most 2 preparations from thesame animal were used for each type of experiment. Resultsare provided in relative values, where 100% contraction meansmaximal spasm of the preparations from the basal tone and, inpre-contracted preparations, 100% relaxation means relaxationof the preparation to the level before adding the precontractingagent. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used for the comparisonsof two independent groups, more than two independent sampleswere compared by the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, and two dependentsamples were compared by the Wilcoxon test. The statisticalprogram GraphPad Prism 5 was used throughout. A probabilityof P < 0.05 or less indicated statistical significance.RESULTSChemical Characterization of RCExtractsIn the HPLC retention time range of 4\u20139 min, four characteristicpeaks were detected in the crude RC extract and its fractionsF40\u2013F100. The corresponding components were isolated fromthe plant material and were identified as the flavonoidsapigenin, eupafolin, hispidulin, and luteolin by 1H and 13CNMR experiments (see Supplementary Figures S1\u2013S6). Thesecompounds were further used as reference standards tocharacterize the RC extracts. The identification of referencecompounds in different extracts was based on matching theretention times and UV spectra. Retention times of luteolin,eupafolin, apigenin, and hispidulin were 4.5, 5.0, 7.5, and8.5 min, respectively (Figure 1). The baseline separation ofthese compounds allowed their reliable quantification in differentextracts.The crude RC extract contained eupafolin as the mainflavonoid, followed by luteolin, hispidulin, and apigenin(Table 1). The fractionation on polyamide resulted insubfractions F20\u2013F100 with different compositions, asdemonstrated by the differences in their flavonoid content.In F20, the quantities of flavonoids were below the level ofquantification. The flavonoid content of the fractions increasedwith increasing MeOH content of the eluting solvent. Thehighest flavonoid levels were measured in F80, except for luteolinand apigenin, which were mainly concentrated in F100.Chemical Characterization of RCEssential OilBased on their retention times and mass spectrometric data,methallyl angelate, 3-methyl pentyl angelate, and 3-methylamylisobutyrate were identified as the major constituents of RCessential oil (19.0, 18.2, and 10.4%, respectively) (Table 2).The identified components comprised 97% of the essentialoil.

The threshold concentrationfor this effect was equal to or below 20 \u00b5g/ml of the extract(which was the lowest concentration tested) and reached aplateau with 60 and 200 \u00b5g/ml. Quantitative results were asfollows (expressed as % of the maximal spasm): 18.8 \u00b1 3.1%at 20 \u00b5g/ml (N = 6), 40.1 \u00b1 3.3% at 60 \u00b5g/ml (N = 11), and36.3 \u00b1 4.9% at 200 \u00b5g/ml (N = 7). A second administrationof the same concentration after a 40-min washout periodusually had a qualitatively similar effect. Yet, because ofvariable reproducibility, we examined the effects on separatepreparations with only one administration of the extract.The solvent of the extract (DMSO; 0.3 or 1 \u00b5l/ml) caused noor minimal contraction (on average, 0 and 2%, respectively;N = 12).The 60 \u00b5g/ml concentration of the extract was used forpharmacological analysis. Both atropine (0.5 \u00b5M), an antagonistof acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors and tetrodotoxin(0.5 \u00b5M), an inhibitor of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels (hence,of neuronal axonal conduction) inhibited the contractile effectof RC crude extract. In contrast, the purinoceptor antagonistPPADS (50 \u00b5M) or a combination of serotonin (5-HT) receptorantagonists methysergide (0.3 \u00b5M), SB204070 (1 \u00b5M) andY25130 (1 \u00b5M) failed to influence the contractile effect ofthe extract (Table 3). This combination of 5-HT antagonists issuitable for blocking the contractile effect of 5-HT (Sandor et al.,2016).The functional blockade of capsaicin-sensitive neurons didnot inhibit the contractile effect of the RC extract (Barth\u00f3 et al.,2004) as compared to time-matched, solvent-treated controls(Table 3).

Fraction F20 induced a moderate contraction(approximately 20% of the maximum) (Table 4). Similarresults were obtained with F40, F60, F80, and F100, although theextent of contraction tended to decline with F60, F80, and F100.Our experiments revealed the smooth muscle relaxing activityof RC extract, fractions and essential oil in this experimentalsetting. On histamine-precontracted preparations (treated with0.5 \u00b5M histamine for 15 min, in the presence of atropineand tetrodotoxin, both 0.5 \u00b5M), concentration-dependentrelaxation was observed in response to treatment with RC crudeextract (60\u2013200 \u00b5g/ml) (Figure 3 and Table 5). The highestconcentration tested induced full relaxation. The relaxationdetected with the 20\u00b5g/ml test sample did not exceed the changesevoked by the solvent itself (1 \u00b5l/ml DMSO; see below). In severalcases the relaxation was preceded by a little contraction.

RC crude extract evokedconcentration-dependent contraction at 20 and 200 \u00b5g/ml(Table 8 and Figure 4 for 200 \u00b5g/ml). The solvent of the extracthad no contractile effect on the bladder (N = 4). The effect ofthe 200 \u00b5g/ml extract was diminished (approximately halved) byin vitro capsaicin pretreatment (Table 8).

The solvent itself (1 \u00b5l/ml DMSO) exerted noeffect.Roman chamomile essential oil caused no contraction ina concentration of 10 \u00b5g/ml. Similarly to the extract, RC oilexerted a moderate relaxing effect on the pre-contracted bladder:17.9 \u00b1 6.1% and 34.1 \u00b1 5.8% relaxation was evoked with 1 and10 \u00b5g/ml, N = 7 and 6, respectively.Effects on Rat GastrointestinalPreparationsThe relaxant effect of RC essential oil was confirmed onlongitudinally oriented preparations of the rat gastrointestinaltract. Rat whole ileum and distal colon preparations arecharacterized by high intrinsic tone, therefore no pre-contraction was needed. RC oil (10 \u00b5g/ml) induced relaxation(41.4 \u00b1 7.4% and 21.8 \u00b1 3.7%, N = 7 and 10, respectively,on these preparations, where 100% means the relaxantresponse to 3 \u00b5M isoprenaline, given at the end of theexperiment). A concentration of 1 \u00b5g/ml was barely effective.No contractile effect was observed. Rat stomach fundus stripswere pre-contracted with 0.1\u20130.3 \u00b5M acetylcholine.

Atropine- and tetrodotoxin-pretreatedpreparations were pre-contracted with PGF2\u03b1 (1 or 2 \u00b5M).RC extract showed a concentration-dependent relaxant effect(25.8 \u00b1 4.3% at 20 \u00b5g/ml, N = 8; 68.5 \u00b1 8.5% at 60 \u00b5g/ml,N = 7; 50.8 \u00b1 3.7% at 200 \u00b5g/ml, N = 9).

RCextract induced relaxation in PGF2\u03b1-precontracted preparations(in the presence of atropine and tetrodotoxin). This effect reached45% with 60 \u00b5g/ml concentration (N = 4), while a concentrationof 200 \u00b5g/ml produced full relaxation (N = 6), where a relaxationto the pre-prostaglandin level was taken as 100%.The solvent itself (1 \u00b5l/ml DMSO) did not evoke eithercontraction or relaxation on this preparation (N = 4\u20136).DISCUSSIONThe experiments presented here have been carried out with RC,which has been used traditionally for the symptomatic treatmentof mild, spasmodic and other gastrointestinal complaints,however, the presumed smooth muscle-relaxant effect has notbeen confirmed experimentally. The aim of our study was toinvestigate the effect of a traditionally used extract of the plant,its fractions and the essential oil of the plant, as well as of four ofits flavonoid components.The phytochemical analysis of the extract revealed thepresence of flavonoids in the plant, four of which (apigenin,luteolin, eupafolin, and hispidulin) were isolated and identified.The hydroethanolic extract was fractionated on polyamideto gain fractions with different flavonoid content in orderto examine the role of these compounds in the effect onsmooth muscles. The flavonoid content of the extract andfractions was analyzed by HPLC. The flavonoid content of theextract was fractionated successfully, fractions F80, F100 (andto some extent F60) containing higher amounts of flavonoidsthan the crude extracts. The flavonoid pattern of fractionsalso differed. The essential oil analyzed by us belongs to thechemotype characterized by the predominance of methallylangelate.Pharmacological experiments were carried out with thehydroethanolic extract, its fractions (F20, F40, F60, F80, andF100), four flavonoids (apigenin, eupafolin, hispidulin, andluteolin) and the essential oil of the plant on differentsmooth muscles in vitro. The hydroethanolic extract of RChas both stimulatory and relaxant effects on guinea pigileum. The moderate, transient stimulatory activity resultsfrom the activation of cholinergic neurons, as confirmedby its inhibition by tetrodotoxin (an inhibitor of neuronalvoltage-sensitive Na+ channels) and atropine (antagonist onmuscarinic receptors for acetylcholine). Although capsaicin,a stimulant of a certain class of sensory receptors (throughwhich it evokes a \u201clocal efferent\u201d response) shows a similarcholinergic, neurogenic effect in guinea pig small intestinepreparations (see Barth\u00f3 et al., 2004 for review), a functionalblockade of capsaicin-sensitive nerve endings by capsaicinpretreatment failed to inhibit the contractile action of RCextract. The contractile action of RC extract was moderately,yet significantly reduced by the cyclooxygenase inhibitorindomethacin, which may indicate a modulatory role ofendogenous prostanoids. Other pharmacological inhibitorstested had no contraction-reducing effect, therefore it isproposed that neither endogenous serotonin, nor PPADS-sensitive purinergic mechanisms play a role in the excitatoryaction of RC extract. It should be noted that both serotonin andATP or the P2X receptor agonist \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP are ableto evoke cholinergic contractions in guinea pig ileum (Benkoet al., 2005; Barth\u00f3 et al., 2006; Sandor et al., 2016 for recentdata).Following the transient and mild-to-moderate stimulanteffect, the RC crude extract exhibited a sustained relaxanteffect on the guinea pig ileum in the presence of tetrodotoxinand atropine, and preliminary experiments indicated a similarrelaxant effect also in the absence of atropine and tetrodotoxin.Yet, atropine and tetrodotoxin were included into theseexperiments for creating a methodologically clear situation,where an initial, neuronally mediated excitatory action wouldhardly interfere with the relaxant one. The concentrationsof the extract causing relaxation were roughly the same asthose causing contraction. Based on these data we proposethat the site of action for the relaxant effect of RC is onthe smooth muscle itself. Neither the adrenergic \u03b2-receptorantagonist propranolol nor the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine significantly reduced the relaxant effect ofthe RC extract, hence, no evidence was found for thesemechanisms to be involved in the relaxant response. In fact,a direct relaxant effect of the extract was demonstrated on allgastrointestinal preparations tested, including human and ratgastrointestinal preparations, as well as in guinea pig bladder.In preparations with high intrinsic tone (rat ileum and ratcolon), relaxant activity was practically the only response to beseen.Different RC extract fractions evoked both contraction andrelaxation on guinea pig ileum. While there was a clear-cuttendency correlation between the flavonoid content and therelaxant effect, in case of contractile action such correlation wasnot observed (on the contrary, fractions with lower flavonoidcontent exerted slightly higher contractile activities). Fractionswith high flavonoid content (F60, F80, and F100) had remarkablerelaxant effects, whereas fractions with no (F20) or low (F40)flavonoid content exerted no such activity. The pure flavonoidsof the extract showed dual effects in the guinea pig ileum, muchsimilarly to the crude extract. Moreover, there was no substantialFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 323201fphar-09-00323 April 4, 2018 Time: 18:30 # 10S\u00e1ndor et al. Spasmolytic Effect of Roman Chamomiledifference between the potencies of the flavonoids. This meansthat any of these flavonoids may contribute to the sustainedrelaxant and the transient contractile effect of the extract. Theessential oil of RC caused no contraction on the test preparations;nevertheless, a consistent relaxant effect was detected. This seemsto indicate that (i) chemical components responsible for thestimulant effect may be absent in the essential oil; (ii) it maybe that several types of compounds present in the extract areresponsible for the smooth muscle-relaxant action. This pointneeds to be clarified in subsequent experiments.The contraction of guinea pig bladder in response to theRC extract proved to be special, in that it was reduced by halffollowing in vitro capsaicin pretreatment. This indicates thatcapsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves of the bladder wall are in someway involved in the excitatory effect of the RC extract (see Barth\u00f3et al., 2004). Nevertheless, the RC extract and oil also inducedbladder relaxation in pre-contracted preparations.Roman chamomile extract was effective in human jejunalpreparations as well. Both an excitatory and a tetrodotoxin-and atropine-resistant relaxing effect were demonstrated, again,the smooth muscle relaxant one being more sustained than theexcitatory one. Preliminary experiments have shown that thisearly contraction is reduced by atropine. Due to limited accessto human tissue, no further analysis of these responses could beperformed.In terms of possible medical uses it may be notedthat a combination of nerve-mediated, mild-to moderateexcitatory effect and a smooth muscle-relaxant action mayeven be advantageous for some gastrointestinal problems, e.g.,diminished peristaltic activity, while for spasms in the stomach orlarge intestine it is obviously the smooth muscle relaxing activitythat offers benefits.CONCLUSIONOur results support the overall smooth muscle relaxant effect ofa hydroethanolic RC extract and of the essential oil of RC. Thepredominant effect of the extract, its fractions and flavonoids isrelaxation, being more sustained than the transient contractionobserved in some cases. This activity is in correlation withthe flavonoid content of the extract. Since the componentsof the essential oil are partly extracted with alcohols, theconstituents of the oil also contribute to the overall effectof the hydroethanolic RC extract. The extract used in ourexperiments was prepared in accordance with the EuropeanMedicines Agency monograph for this plant, therefore our studycontributes to the body of evidence relating the traditional use ofthis plant.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSZS, DK, TB, and RP carried out the organ bath experiments.

Theseactivities are attributed to the action of polyphenols. Previously it has beendemonstrated, that one of the most abundant polyphenolic compounds in ethanolicextracts of propolis are chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid.Although their pro-apoptotic activity on human tongue squamous cell carcinomacells (CAL-27) was established previously, the detailed mechanism of this processremains unclear. Considering the crucial role of proline metabolism and prolinedehydrogenase/proline oxidase (PRODH/POX) in the regulation of cancer cellsurvival/apoptosis, we studied these processes in polyphenol-treated CAL-27 cells.All studied polyphenols evoked anti-proliferative activity, accompanied by increasedPRODH/POX, P53, active caspases-3 and -9 expressions and decreased collagenbiosynthesis, prolidase activity and proline concentration in CAL-27 cells. These datasuggest that polyphenols of propolis induce PRODH/POX-dependent apoptosis throughup-regulation of mitochondrial proline degradation and down-regulation of prolineutilization for collagen biosynthesis.Keywords: proline, proline oxidase, propolis, flavonoids, phenolic acids, collagen, SCCINTRODUCTIONHistorically, propolis has been a key element of healthcare, and it products are still widely used asan alternative and complementary therapy or often as a primary treatment. Ethnopharmacologyproved that propolis has medicinal properties , setting out directions for further research.Studies on the biological activity of propolis conducted in recent years revealed a wide spectrumof its activities. Propolis has many therapeutic properties, including antibacterial, antifungal,antiviral, cytotoxic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory as well as immunomodulatory activity(Bankova et al., 2014).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 336204fphar-09-00336 April 3, 2018 Time: 17:22 # 2Celin\u00b4ska-Janowicz et al. Propolis Polyphenols Induce PRODH/POX-Dependent ApoptosisThe chemical composition of propolis is related to itsregion of origin, however, some compounds occur in acomparable amount in all propolis samples (Popova et al.,2015, 2017a,b; Graikou et al., 2016). To broadly knownpropolis components belong among others: diterpenes, lignans,sesquiterpenes, acetophenones (Bankova, 2005), flavonoids andphenolic acid esters (Bankova et al., 2000) which are responsiblefor numerous of its biological activities (Kubiliene et al., 2015;Turan et al., 2015; Yildirim et al., 2016).Recently, the interest is focused on anticancer properties ofpropolis. In cancer cells treated with propolis significant changesin various intracellular amino acids and their metabolites werefound, among which proline was proved to significantly affectcell viability. The increase in proline concentration was observedin numerous cancer cell lines. The phenomenon was relatedto cancer survival (Surazynski et al., 2008a) and poor patientprognosis. However, proline degradation by PRODH/POX wasfound to induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines (Sadowskaet al., 2013; Kononczuk et al., 2015a). Therefore, compoundsthat modulate intracellular proline metabolism are of greatimportance as potential anticancer factors.An important source of proline is collagen. The final productsof collagen degradation in lysosomes are imidodipeptides(containing C-terminal proline) that are further hydrolyzedto amino acids by cytoplasmic imidodipeptidase\u2013prolidase[E.C. 3.4.13.9]. Therefore, prolidase plays an important rolein the regulation of proline-dependent functions. One ofthe regulatory role of prolidase is providing proline forcollagen re-synthesis. Alternatively, proline is degradedinto pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) in mitochondriaby PRODH/POX. The conversion generates superoxideanion that may contribute to ROS-dependent induction ofapoptosis (Liu et al., 2006; Phang et al., 2008a,b). Severalstudies established the function of PRODH/POX as a tumorsuppressor gene. Therefore, the inhibition of its activity iscorrelated with a cancer progression. In several cancer cells, ascancer of kidney or cancers of digestive tract, the expressionof PRODH/POX is very low or not detected (Phang and Liu,2012).Proline can be also synthesized either from ornithine byornithine aminotransferase (OAT) or from glutamic acid byP5C synthase, then P5C might be converted to proline by P5Creductase (PYCR), leading to increase in proline concentration.These pathways are therefore considered in studied on proline-dependent responses of cancer cells.The squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the mostfrequent cancers of the oral cavity cancer [oral squamouscell carcinoma (OSCC)]. It is characterized as highly invasivewith the ability to give early and extensive lymph nodesmetastases (Carvalho et al., 2004). The cancer treatment isprimarily focused on the resection of a tumor. Afterward,the radiotherapy and the chemotherapy are followed. Upto date, therapeutic protocols do not offer to the patientswith advanced SCC, effective therapeutic options. Thelack of any advanced alternative pharmacotherapy of SCCis a problem of modern medicine (Pilch and Bouquot,2005).Several studies revealed the connection between theoverexpression of oral cancer overexpressed 1 protein(ORAOV1) and the occurrence of more aggressive tumorsin esophagus (Zhai et al., 2014). Additionally, ORAOV-1-overexpressed cell lines, among others CAL-27 cell line, aremarked with a higher intracellular proline concentration andstronger resistance on treatment (Jiang et al., 2008, 2010). Itwas confirmed that ORAOV1 influences PYCR activity. Hence,the increase in intracellular proline level was observed andconsequently the promotion of tumor progression (Togashiet al., 2014). Hence, the effect of chosen polyphenols on prolinemetabolism may be a relevant issue in the apoptosis induction(Phang et al., 2012).The purpose of the study was to identify mechanisms ofcytotoxic activity of selected propolis components consideringtheir effect on the proline metabolism in CAL-27 cell line.Previous analysis of the commercially available, standardizedpreparations of propolis allowed to identify a few of the mostabundant polyphenols as chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid,and ferulic acid (Maciejewicz et al., 2001; Markiewicz-Z\u02d9ukowskaet al., 2012; Czyz\u02d9ewska et al., 2015, 2016). The study revealedthe proapoptotic effect of these compounds on CAL-27 cell line(Czyz\u02d9ewska et al., 2016), however, its molecular mechanism stillremains unclear. In this report, we present their effect on theapoptosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (CAL-27) and themechanism of the activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureThe studies were performed on tongue squamous cell line (CAL-27).

After then a cycle of frost and defrost followed.Lastly, the cell solution was sonicated and preserved at \u221280\u25e6Cuntil further analysis. The used method allowed to determineintracellular concentration of proline and to compare treated cellswith untreated ones.The intracellular level of proline was determined using HPLCsystem (Agilent Technologies, Germany) connected to QTOFmass spectrometry detector (Agilent Technologies, Germany).Electrospray ionization (ESI) was used as an ion source. Theanalysis was performed on a HILIC column (Luna HILIC,Phenomenex, United States). Samples were injected in a volumeof 2 \u00b5L. The procedure required maintenance at 40\u25e6C. Thesystem was operated in both positive and negative mode atflow rate 1 mL/min with solvent A \u2013 water with 10 mMammonium formate, and solvent B \u2013 acetonitrile/water (9:1,v:v) with 10 mM ammonium formate.

The assay was performed usingNucleoCounter R\u00a9 NC-3000TM system (ChemoMetec, Denmark)according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Cells incubated withstudied concentrations of polyphenols were detached from theplates, washed and stained with Solution 5 (containing threevarious reagents: VitaBright-48, propidium iodide, and acridineorange). Cisplatin (10 \u00b5M) was used as a positive control.Thereafter, the intensity of fluorescence was measured usingNucleoCounter R\u00a9 NC-3000TM.Determination of Prolidase ActivityThe activity of prolidase was determined according to themethod of Myara et al. (1982). It is colorimetric assayusing Chinard\u2019s reagent. To perform the assay cells weredetached and scraped off using Cell Lysis Buffer (CellSignaling, United States). N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-L-proline (Cbz-Pro) (Bachem, United States) (5 mM) was used as a positivecontrol. Then samples were sonicated for 3 s \u00d7 10 s at 0\u25e6Cand then centrifuged at 16000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. Afterward, thecell pellet was discarded. Supernatants were used for proteindetermination according to Lowry method and evaluation ofprolidase activity. The activation of prolidase requires incubationof cell extract supernatant with Mn (II), due to this factthe 100 \u00b5L of each sample was mixed with 100 \u00b5L of50 mM HEPES (pH 7.8) containing MnCl2 to achieve thefinal concentration 1 mM of MnCl2. Incubation lasts for 24 hat 37\u25e6C then the prolidase reaction was initiated by adding100 \u00b5L of the activation mixture which was 94 mM glycyl-proline(Gly-Pro). After adding of Gly-Pro samples were incubatedfor 1 h at 37\u25e6C. The reaction was terminated by addition1 mL of 0.45 M trichloroacetic acid. Parallel blank tubescontained trichloroacetic acid was added at time \u201czero.\u201d Afterthe samples centrifugation (10.000 \u00d7 g for 15 min) the amountof released proline was determined by adding trichloroaceticacid/supernatant to the mixture of glacial acetic acid: Chinard\u2019sreagent. Then followed incubation for 10 min at 90\u25e6C. Thedetermination of proline was based on the measurement ofabsorbance at 515 nm. Prolidase activity was expressed asnanomoles of proline released per minute per milligram ofprotein.Collagen BiosynthesisCollagen biosynthesis was measured as the incorporation ofradioactive proline into proteins. CAL-27 were incubated withvarious concentrations of polyphenols and with the 5 \u00b5Ci/mLof 5[3H]-proline (Hartman Analytic GmbH, Germany) for24 h. 2-Metoxyestradiol (MOE) (Sigma-Aldrich, United States)(10 \u00b5M) was used as a positive control.

The statistical significances were calculatedusing one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisontests. Differences at p < 0.001 were accepted as statisticallysignificant.RESULTSStudied Polyphenols SignificantlyReduce the Viability of CAL-27 CancerCellsThe influence of chosen polyphenols (chrysin, caffeic acid,p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid) on the viability of humantongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line (CAL-27) wasdetermined with MTT assay. The studied polyphenols abilityto induce the cytotoxic effect in CAL-27 was observed forall polyphenolic compounds (Figure 1). The use of chrysinresulted in a reduction of cell survival to 82, 62, 32, and29%. In the case of caffeic acid, decreased CAL-27 cellssurvival to 81, 62, and 61% was observed. The use of ferulicacid decreased cell survival to 85, 65, and 50% compared tocontrols whereas in the case of p-coumaric acid, the viabilityof CAL-27 cells was reduced to 82, 80, and 73% compared tocontrols (100%). To evaluate whether polyphenols cytotoxicitywas a result of their influence on cell DNA biosynthesisthe capability of intracellular thymidine incorporation wasassessed.The Inhibition of DNA Biosynthesis AfterPolyphenols ApplicationThe effects of chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acidon DNA biosynthesis in CAL-27 cells were evaluated as [3H]-thymidine incorporation into viable cells. The downregulationof DNA biosynthesis in CAL-27 cells was observed for allpolyphenolic compounds (Figure 2). The obtained results showthat the addition of chrysin resulted in a reduction in DNAbiosynthesis by 46, 80, 83, and 83% whereas the application ofcaffeic acid leads to a reduction of DNA biosynthesis by 14,31, and 52%. Moreover, the similar situation was observed afteradding ferulic acid where the DNA biosynthesis was reducedby 16, 46, 53, and 71%. In the case of using p-coumaricacid, DNA biosynthesis was also reduced by 67, 78, and 83%.These findings of indicate that all polyphenols are inhibitorsof DNA biosynthesis in CAL-27 SCC cells, and the intensityof this process depends on the concentration of the compoundused.To evaluate whether chosen compounds lead to the cell deaththrough the apoptosis pathway involved proline metabolismregulation the western immunoblot assay was performed.For further analysis polyphenols were used at the lowestdoses that contributed to noticeable cytotoxic effects. Appliedconcentrations were as follows: chrysin \u2013 5 \u00b5g/mL, caffeic acid \u201365 \u00b5g/mL, ferulic acid \u2013 50 \u00b5g/mL, and p-coumaric acid \u201370 \u00b5g/mL.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 336207fphar-09-00336 April 3, 2018 Time: 17:22 # 5Celin\u00b4ska-Janowicz et al.

The stars indicate that value were significantly different (\u2217p < 0.001) compared withcontrol.Selected Polyphenols Activate p53,PRODH/POX, Caspase 9 and 3 in CAL-27Cell LineThe study was conducted applying Western Immunoblot methoddescribed in chapter 2.5. CAL-27 cells were subjected to 24 hexposure to selected concentrations of polyphenols: chrysin(5 \u00b5g/mL), caffeic acid (65 \u00b5g/mL), ferulic acid (50 \u00b5g/mL),and p-coumaric acid (70 \u00b5g/mL). To evaluate the course ofapoptosis process the caspases expression were assessed. Thefindings showed the reduction of expression of total caspase 3 inCAL-27 cells incubated with all of the tested polyphenols. Thelargest reduction in the expression of the total caspase 3 formcompared to the control was observed in cells incubated withchrysin (5 \u00b5g/mL) and ferulic acid (50 \u00b5g/mL) (Figure 3A).Additionally, the obtained data showed reduced expression oftotal caspase 9 in CAL-27 cells incubated with all polyphenolstested. The most significant reduction in the expression of thetotal caspase 9 form was observed in cells incubated with chrysin(5 \u00b5g/mL) and ferulic acid (50 \u00b5g/mL) (Figure 3C). Moreover,obtained results revealed an increase in cleaved caspases 9 and 3expressions in CAL-27 cells after incubation with each of usedpolyphenols (Figure 3). The highest increase in expression ofactive caspase 9 compared to control was observed in CAL-27 cells exposed to caffeic acid (65 \u00b5g/mL) and p-coumaricacid (70 \u00b5g/mL) (Figure 3D). Furthermore, the data revealedincreased expression of the active form of caspase 3 in CAL-27cells incubated with each of the polyphenols tested. The mostnoticeable increase in expression of active caspase 3 in relationto control was observed in the case of CAL-27 cells exposed tochrysin (5 \u00b5g/mL) and p-coumaric acid (70 \u00b5g/mL) (Figure 3B).The following results confirm the pro-apoptotic effect of thepolyphenols. These compounds stimulate the expression of theactive forms of the initiator caspase 9 involved in the activationof the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and the executive caspase3. The initiation of apoptosis through the activation of the p53protein is accompanied by the induction of proline oxidase(PRODH/POX) expression. It is a mitochondrial enzyme thatcatalyzes the conversion of proline to pyrroline-5-carboxylatewhile transferring free electrons to cytochrome c resulting inFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 336208fphar-09-00336 April 3, 2018 Time: 17:22 # 6Celin\u00b4ska-Janowicz et al.

Therefore, to further examination whether observedapoptosis involved the changes in PRODH/POX activity, thewestern immunoblot for PRODH/POX and p53 (the most potentinducer of this protein expression) was conducted. Receivedoutcomes demonstrated the increase in PRODH/POX expressionin all studied cases (Figure 3F). The obtained results coincidewith the p53 expression that was increased in all samples.Nonetheless, the lowest increase was observed in CAL-27 cellspreviously incubated with ferulic acid (Figures 3E,F).The Proapoptotic Effect of Chrysin,Caffeic Acid, p-Coumaric Acid, andFerulic AcidTo confirm induction of apoptosis by the polyphenols the vitalityassay was performed. The cells were subjected to 24 h exposureto tested polyphenols in the following concentrations: chrysin(5 \u00b5g/mL), caffeic acid (65 \u00b5g/mL), ferulic acid (50 \u00b5g/mL), andp-coumaric acid (70 \u00b5g/mL). The obtained outcomes revealed asignificant decrease in cellular GSH concentration in treated cellscompared to untreated control (Figure 4). The most noticeableincrease in the cell population with the low level of GSH wasobserved in CAL-27 cells treated with chrysin. The loss ofGSH is broadly known to be directly related to the apoptosisprogression and the assay confirmed our data received from MTTassay.The performed assays confirmed the apoptosis induction intreated cells. To estimate whether chosen compounds leads toapoptosis through the disruption of proline metabolism, furtherstudies were conducted.Chrysin, Caffeic Acid, p-Coumaric Acid,and Ferulic Acid Affect the CellularMetabolism of ProlineProline transformations affect the regulation of cellularmetabolism and apoptosis.

It affects a number of cell processes,including regulation of gene expression, growth, differentiation,and metabolism of cells. It has been observed that in cancercells, this mechanism is disrupted due to the increased activityof metalloproteinases (MMPs), contributing to the increaseddegradation of collagen. The biosynthesis level of this proteinmay reflect changes in metabolic processes in living cells. SinceFIGURE 7 | Prolidase activity in CAL-27 cells treated for 24 h with chosenpolyphenols (chrysin \u2013 5 \u00b5g/mL, caffeic acid \u2013 65 \u00b5g/mL, ferulic acid \u201350 \u00b5g/mL, and p-coumaric acid \u2013 70 \u00b5g/mL).

The most noticeable decrease in collagenbiosynthesis was observed in the cells incubated with chrysin.Inhibition of Prolidase Activity by TestedPolyphenolsProlidase [E.C. 3.4.13.9] is a key enzyme involved in theprocess of collagen biosynthesis. This enzyme is involved in thebreakdown of imidopeptides that are degradation products ofcollagen fibers. In the last stage of collagen degradation, prolidasecatalyzes the reaction of the release of proline and hydroxyprolineimidopeptides. The released proline can then be included in thecollagen biosynthesis or other metabolic pathways, e.g., relatedto the process of apoptosis or the neoangiogenesis process. Sinceproline is the major constituent of collagen (it represents themain source of the aminoacids), their metabolism is directlyconnected. Due to this fact, prolidase plays a crucial role in therecycling of proline for collagen biosynthesis. In CAL-27 cellsincubated with test polyphenols (chrysin \u2013 5\u00b5g/mL, caffeic acid \u201365\u00b5g/mL, ferulic acid \u2013 50\u00b5g/mL, p-coumaric acid \u2013 70\u00b5g/mL),a reduction in the activity of prolidase was observed, by 81% \u2013p-coumaric acid, 78% \u2013 chrysin, 77% \u2013 ferulic acid, 66% \u2013 caffeicacid in relation to the control (Figure 7).DISCUSSIONThe SCC is one of the most frequent cancers of the oral cavity.It is associated with high invasiveness and ability to induceFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 336212fphar-09-00336 April 3, 2018 Time: 17:22 # 10Celin\u00b4ska-Janowicz et al. Propolis Polyphenols Induce PRODH/POX-Dependent Apoptosisearly and extensive lymph nodes metastases (Carvalho et al.,2004). The lack of advanced pharmacotherapy of SCC requiressearching for new effective pharmacological strategies (Pilch andBouquot, 2005). In this study, we found that selected polyphenolsof propolis induced apoptosis in CAL-27 cells through up-regulation of proline metabolism.Recent studies revealed the enhanced progression of theSCC due to up-regulation of proline level induced by amplifiedgenes expression of ORAOV1 and P5C-reductase (Togashi et al.,2014). Therefore, we considered proline metabolism as a targetfor potential treatment of SCC. In fact, proline bearing reducingpotential is considered as a stress molecule. Its metabolismplays an important role in maintaining energetic and redoxbalance in cells. Free cytoplasmic proline may up-regulatetranscriptional activity of HIF-1\u03b1 that is considered as pro-survival and inflammatory transcription factor since it inducesexpression of COX-2, VEGF, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, NF-\u03baB (Surazynskiet al., 2008a).Proline could be removed from the cytoplasm byincorporation into collagen. Collagen biosynthesis mayserve as a sink for proline. Up-regulation of collagenbiosynthesis can remove reducing potential, but it maycontribute to tissue cirrhosis usually accompanying prolongedinflammation (Priest and Davies, 1969; Davis and Cowie,1990). Interesting is a fact of significant alterations in collagencontent in SCC tissue. Agarwal and Ballabh indicated a definitealteration in the distribution of collagen type IV with itssignificant loss in poorly-differentiated SCC tissue (Agarwaland Ballabh, 2013), related to increased metastasis. On theother hand, proline is generated from imidodipeptides (derivedfrom collagen degradation products) by imidopeptidase \u2013prolidase. Therefore, the enzyme activity represents animportant factor in the regulation of intracellular prolineconcentration. However, other mechanisms that contribute togeneration as well as, utilization of intracellular proline are aswell-important.A critical pathway of proline utilization is mitochondrialdegradation by proline oxidase \u2013 PRODH/POX. During thisprocess ROS and/or ATP are generated. PRODH/POX iswidely distributed in living organisms and is responsible fora number of regulatory processes such as redox homeostasis,osmotic adaptation, cell signaling, and oxidative stress. Recentdata provided evidence that enzyme plays a crucial role ininhibition of carcinogenesis and tumor growth. It may induceapoptosis in both intrinsic and extrinsic ways in cancercells (Zareba and Palka, 2016). Unfortunately, the enzymeis often down-regulated in cancer cells leading to inhibitedapoptosis (Kononczuk et al., 2015a). Our results indicatedalmost undetectable expression of PRODH/POX in CAL-27cells. Therefore, we analyzed propolis compounds as factorsinducing PRODH/POX expression and decreasing proline level.We suggest that polyphenols contained in propolis induced theenzyme activity, leading to induction of apoptosis in CAL-27cells.We found that studied polyphenols decreased in a dose-dependent manner the viability of CAL-27 cells. Moreover,the treatment inhibited DNA biosynthesis in these cells. Thedecrease in cell number was related to induction of apoptosis.We observed a significant increase in expression of active/cleavedcaspases -3 and -9 and increase in the amount of the cells withlow level of reduced glutathione (GSH) in polyphenol-treatedCAL-27 cells. Considering the important role of PRODH/POXin apoptosis (Phang, 2017), its expression was evaluated. Thepolyphenols induced expression of PRODH/POX in CAL-27cells. Cell growth arrest related to apoptosis is induced byp53. The transcription factor is the most potent inducer ofPRODH/POX expression (Nagano et al., 2017). In fact, p53expression was also induced by studied polyphenols in SCCcells.PRODH/POX-dependent utilization of proline in polyphenol-treated CAL-27 cells was confirmed by LC\u2013MS analysis ofproline concentration. Since proline could be utilized incollagen, the biosynthesis of this protein was determined.All tested compounds significantly inhibited the process. Itsuggests that observed decrease in proline concentration wasrelated to its metabolism by PRODH/POX. The decreaseof collagen biosynthesis in polyphenol-treated CAL-27 cellsmay result from inhibition of prolidase by polyphenols. Theenzyme plays an important role in collagen biosynthesis(Palka and Phang, 1997; Surazynski et al., 2008b; Kononczuket al., 2015a). We observed inhibition of prolidase activityin the cells treated with studied compounds (however tovarious degree). We suggest, that decrease in proline levelby propolis compounds result from proline degradationin mitochondria by induced PRODH/POX and not byutilization of this amino acid for collagen biosynthesis. Thesignificant role of PRODH/POX in apoptosis induction wedescribed previously (Kononczuk et al., 2015b). Stimulationof PRODH/POX expression by Eptifibatide, \u03b1IIb\u03b23-integrininhibitor, lead to strong proapoptotic effect in MCF-7 breastcancer cells.The present study provides for the first time evidence thatcompounds of propolis (chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid,and ferulic acid, of which the most potential effect on CAL-27 cells growth inhibition was attributed to chrysin) contributeto the induction of PRODH/POX-dependent apoptosis inCAL-27 cells. Therefore, PRODH/POX may represent a noveltarget for the propolis-induced anticancer activity in SCCcells.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSKC-J, UL, and WM: conceived and designed the experiments.KC-J, IZ, and JT: performed the experiments.

Their correctbotanical provenance is an essential basis for understanding the ethnic cultures, aswell as for chemical identification of the novel bioactive molecules with therapeuticeffects. This work describes the use of herbal medicines in the Beskid mountain rangeslocated south of Krakow and Lviv, two influential medieval centers of apothecary traditionin the region. Local botanical remedies shared by Boyko, Lemko, and Gorale ethnicgroups were a part of the medieval European system of medicine, used according totheir Dioscoridean and Galenic qualities. Within the context of ethnic plant medicineand botanical classification, this review identified strong preferences for local use ofSt John\u2019s-wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.), garlic(Allium sativum L.), gentian (Gentiana lutea L.), lovage (Levisticum officinaleW.D.J. Koch),and lesser periwinkle (Vinca minor L.). While Ukrainian ethnic groups favored the use ofguilder-rose (Viburnum opulus L.) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), Polish inhabitantsespecially valued angelica (Angelica archangelica L.) and carline thistle (Carlina acaulisL.). The region also holds a strong potential for collection, cultivation, and manufactureof medicinal plants and plant-based natural specialty ingredients for the food, healthand cosmetic industries, in part due to high degree of biodiversity and ecologicalpreservation. Many of these products, including whole food nutritional supplements, willsoon complement conventional medicines in prevention and treatment of diseases, whileadding value to agriculture and local economies.Keywords: ethnobotany, traditional knowledge, herbal texts, bioactive compounds, functional foods, folkremediesINTRODUCTIONThe terms Beskids or Beskid Mountains (Beschad Alpes Poloniae) denote the Carpathian mountainranges that historically separated kingdoms of Poland from Ruthenia (Ukraine) and Hungary asdescribed in the 1269 Hungarian deed (Papee, 1891). The Beskids are approximately 600 km inlength stretching from Moravian Gate in the west (Czech Republic) to Vyshkovsky Pass in the216Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicineseast (Ukraine) along the modern Polish-Slovak border, but arerather narrow (50\u201370 km in width). Gorale, Lemko, Boyko, andRusyn ethnic groups of mixed Slavic, Vlah (Aromanian) andThraco-Celtic origins primarily populate these areas (Figure 1).During tenth\u2013fourteenth centuries, Beskids formed a transborderregion of limited political and economic affiliation, defined bya line of defensive border settlements (La: ultra indagines, Ua:zasiky, Pl: bron) advancing slowly toward the mountain ridgesalong the Spis-Borzhava axis in the south and Myslenice-Sanok-Dolyna axis in the north (Halaga, 1961). Turka on the route toUzhok Pass and Wietrzno-Bobrka on the route to Dukla Passwere typical examples of such defensive hillforts (Ua: gorodysche,Pl: grodzisko). In the fourteenth century, continuous colonizationof the Beskids was described as of Ruthenus, Ruthenus-Valachus,Ruthenos seu Valachos, or Valachus origin (Hoshko, 1983).The ongoing debate whether these terms identified a properethnic affiliation of the migrants or their rustic (agricultural) vs.valachian (pastoral) background has not been settled (Stavrovsky,1967). The transborder status, however, combined with severegeographical and socioeconomic isolation, resulted in self-treatment as a primary choice of both medicinal and spiritualhealing. Even at the beginning of the twentieth century, onemedical doctor served on average 9,000\u201317,000 inhabitants(Otchet, 1915), and a doctor\u2019s reputation and recognition waswell below that of a local pharmacist or a traditional healer.The use of plants and their preparations in Europeanmedicine, drawing upon the traditions of both the classical andArab civilizations, was formalized by works of Hippocrates ofKos (Corpus Hippocraticum), Dioscorides (De Materia Medica),Pliny (Naturalis Historiae), Avicenna (Liber Canonis), andGalen of Pergamon (Hidden Drugs, survived only in Arabictranslation as Al-Adwiya al-Maktuma) as the science of usingfresh plants and dry herbs to improve human health (Cruse,1999). Prior to 900\u20131200 AD, however, no written recordsdescribed traditional herbal treatments used by Celtic, Slavic,and Germanic tribes that bordered the Roman Empire. Firstmedieval manuscripts that partially documented the use ofherbs in these areas were largely translations from earlierFIGURE 1 | Study area that includes Beskin ridges of the Carpathin Mountains: (A) Schematic map of the mountain region that serves as a border between Ukraine,Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania, and (B) Schematic mountain areas inhibited by Gorale, Lemko, Boyko, Rusyn, and Hutsul ethinc groups.Latin works that incorporated local variations in methods ofcollection, preparation, and use (Singer, 1927), including Bald\u2019sLeechbook andOld English herbals (Anglo-Saxon, tenth\u2013eleventhcentury), Regimen Sanitatis (Italian, tenth century), Physiciansof Myddvai (Welsh, fourteenth century), and various editionsof [H]ortus Sanitatis (1491) based on the German HerbariusMaguntie impressus of 1484 and Herbarius zu Teutsch of 1485.The latter monographs were intended to treat of cheap andhomely remedies for the use of the poor, as most herbs listed inthese books were native or garden plants, while very few exoticremedies were described in details.A glimpse of medieval Slavic herbal tradition could befound in the tenth\u2013eleventh century manuscripts Izborniki(Anthologies, transcribed in 1073 and 1076 for PrinceSvyatoslav of Kyiv from manuscripts that had belonged toTsar Simeon of Bulgaria) that described medicinal uses ofseveral plants, including henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), hemlock(Conium maculatum), and wormwood (Artemisia absinthium).Subsequent herbal manuscripts (Ua: travnyk, zilejnyk, vertograd,Pl: zielnik) from sixteenth to eighteenth centuries often combinedtraditional herbal medicines with irrational magical applications.For example, while the seventeenth century vertograd describedmanagement of fever and pain with cabbage (Brassica oleracea)and beet (Beta vulgaris) leaves, and infection diseases with onion(Allium cepa) and garlic (Allium sativum), it also prescribed amixture of horse and goat manure to cure alopecia in 3 days(Krylov, 1985). Nonetheless, these manuscripts served duringthe late Middle Ages as veritable manuals of practical herbalmedicine. Their text and images were usually mechanicallytranscribed from earlier works of the most varied provenance,while the successive owners often enriched the contents withpersonal observations and experiences.OLDEST HERBALS PRINTED IN THECARPATHIAN FORELANDFoundation of Prague University in 1348 and Krakow Universityin 1364 provided diverse educational opportunities for wealthyFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 295217Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicineslocal families of Polish and Ruthenian descent, and led to theexpansion of local medicinal and apothecary tradition. Krakow,and later Lviv, quickly developed into two influential medievalcenters of apothecary, with former also serving as an importantpublishing site of printed herbal texts.Here, six major monographs describing the use of medicinalplants were published between 1532 and 1613 (Table 1). Thefirst one was a Latin reprint of De Herbarum Virtutibus (Naples,1477) with plants names translated into Polish for the first timeby Simon de Lowicz in 1532. Its significance lies in the factthat it was the first document of such length to indicate arenewed interest on this subject and to reveal direct influenceof Dioscorides and Pliny. Even though there was no evidenceof experimentation, and whether or not the author actually everattempted to use any of the herbs of which he wrote, this herbalhad a tremendous influence on medical and botanical literaturefrom the early Middle Ages (Flood, 1976). One testimonialto the wider influence Macer had on subsequent medical andbotanical commentators was a large number of translations ofthe herbal into vernacular languages and dialects. Its popularitywas likely partially due to the selection of predominantly nativeEuropean plants (39) or medicinal herbs cultivated in thegardens (25) over the exotic plants (13) that were difficult toprocure.Stefan Falimirz (Falimir, a Ruthenian courtier to JanTenczynski, the Duke of Podola in Krasnik) compiled variousLatin [H]ortus Sanitatismanuscripts, translated them into Polish,and released a first popular encyclopedia of traditional medicinesentitled O ziolach i o mocy ich (On herbs and their power)in Krakow (1534). The subjects covered herbs and herbalmedicines (including the first use of Polish term wodkameaning\u201clittle water\u201d to describe high proof spirit distilled from grain),medicinal properties of animals and minerals, obstetrics, surgery,and were profusely illustrated with over 550 mostly originalwoodcuts. Plants were described in a set of 261 articles onEuropean and 69 exotic herbal remedies. Descriptions of plantsand their use, however, were mostly translations from theprevious sources and likely unknown to the author (Elbanowski,2014). This became very clear when compared to other chaptersdescribing animals, where Stefan provided extensive and originaldetails on local fishes, a subject apparently of great familiarityto the author. Specifically, Stefan stated, \u201cBecause we live inPoland, there is a need to know characteristics and use of Polishfishes, as we use them regularly. The ones that help, the ones thatharm, the good, the better, and the worst.\u201d This statement for thefirst time indicated the emerging perception of inadequacy ofcontemporary Latinmanuscripts that lacked local knowledge andtradition.HieronimSpiczynski ofWielun (a wealthy Polish councilmanin Krakow) attempted an adaptation of Stefan Falimirz\u2019s work bypublishing O ziolach tutecznych y zamorskich y o mocy ich (Onlocal and overseas herbs and their power, 1542) with improvedwoodcuts. The monograph contained similar and often identicaldescriptions of several medical guides to practical use of herbalremedies. The catalog of herbs was focused on local plants listedunder Polish and Latin names, with a shorter list of exotic plantsidentified only in Latin. Compared to other herbals, it containednarrower descriptions of plant species with no mention of theirorigin or occurrence.Marcin Siennik (Merten He\u00fcwrecher, a wealthy merchantof German origin in Krakow) compiled another adaptation ofFalimirz\u2019s herbal 26 years later as Herbarz to jest ziol tutecznych,postronnych i zamorskich opisanie (Herbal as description oflocal, foreign and overseas plants, 1568). Quick comparisonamong these editions revealed minor changes in the order ofthe chapters, woodcuts, and plant names. Siennik held neither aprofessional title nor a degree, and seemingly edited books solelyto make income in accordance with publisher\u2019s instructions. Theonly freedom that he enjoyed was expanding the list of plantnicknames, to which he contributed many new names, howeverboth descriptions and uses of various remedies were transcribedintact, together with all previous errors and omissions.

Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicinesresulting monograph was published under a new name, withmodified woodcuts and an expanded index including Germannames (Rostafinski, 1888).Marcin deUrzedow (a Polish Catholic priest born inUrzedownear Lublin, and a graduate of Krakow University) compiledHerbarz polski, to jest o przyrodzeniu ziol i dzew rozmaitych(Polish Herbal, 1595) that was printed after his death andincluded descriptions of 372 local plant remedies and 105 exoticherbs. Plants were listed in Latin alphabetical order and wereheavily influenced by independent translations from DioscoridesMateria medica and Fuchs Cometraii insignes. Among those,only 259 chapters described wild native plants characteristic ofthe Polish countryside. The woodcuts, however, were the sameones used in Siennik herbal to depict 240 local herbs\u2013and forthis reason, the rest of the herbal remedies were illustratedby woodcuts that were repeated or omitted altogether. Theindividual reports lacked a particular order of presentation, withsome chapters organized by location, description and use, whileothers discussed herbal properties prior to their looks and origins(Rostafinski, 1888).Szymon Syrenius (Syreniusz, Syrenski) of Oswiencim, agraduate of Krakow and Padua Universities, moved to Lvivand established his medical office there in 1578. He spent next30 years collecting botanical flora from the northern slopes ofBeskids mountain ranges, including trips to more distant regionsof Podolia and Pokuttya. Here he compiled the most extensivePolish herbal to date\u2013Zielnik herbarzem z iezyka lacinskiego zowia(Polish herbal, 1613), printed 2 years subsequent to his death.Similarly to previously described monographs, this volume waslargely based on translations of Dioscorides Materia medicaand its adaptation by Petri Matthioli, known as Senensis midici,commentarii in sex libros (1565), including the original woodcutsfrom Matthioli\u2019s work (Rostanski, 1997). The volume provideddetailed records of 765 plants, mostly from Southern and CentralEurope. The information was presented in a systematic way,including plant description, area of distribution, collection andprocessing techniques, and medicinal properties, followed by anindex of Latin, Polish, and German names.Finally, a fairly unknown Old-Eastern-Yiddish remedy book(refue-bukh) with the Hebrew title of Seyfer derekh ets ha-khayimwas printed in Poland in 1613. While the exact printing place ofthe book is unknown, as is the name of the author, Krakow wasone of the possible places of its origin (Geller, 2009). Apart from arichly decorated title page, the book contains no illustrations, sotechnically it was not an herbal but rather a self-help botanicalguide. It described 87 remedies of plant, animal, and mineralorigin, with many Polish words used to identify plant names.Most botanical terms and folk remedies were referenced to thetradition of Hippocrates, Dioscorides, and Avicenna, thereforeit is not clear whether this book was an original compilationof the classical sources, or a more recent adaptation of oneof the herbals similar to those listed above. To this point, wewould like to highlight the unknown author\u2019s experience at thePadua medical school to which he refers in the beginning ofhis book (Geller, 2009)\u2013a striking parallel to the educationalbackground of his contemporaries Marcin de Urzedow andSzymon Syrenius. This may suggest a Padua-Krakow axis asa primary route for introduction and adaptation of antiquebotanical knowledge into the Carpathian region. Indeed, over thecourse of the sixteenth century, approximately 1,400 Polish andRuthenian students, including nearly all physicians to the Polishroyal family, attended Padua University (Theodorescu, 1989).Jan Zamoyski, Polsih Crown Chancellor and graduate of PaduaUniversity, founded Zamojski Academy in 1594 and shortly afterthat, a Jesuit Collegium was founded in Lviv (1608), which laterbecame Lviv Academy (1661). Together with Krakow University,these institutions rapidly became the major centers of intellectualand spiritual life in the region.ON RELEVANCE OF PRINTED HERBALSTO TRADITIONAL BOTANICALKNOWLEDGEThe sixteenth century scholars discovered a critical obstaclein sorting and presenting botanical knowledge that hadaccumulated over the centuries in antique natural and medicalliterature, and had been translated to various languages onmultiple independent occasions. The same plants were oftengiven different names based on the place of their origin. To makethings worse, the ancient texts and names of old herbal remedieswere often distorted due to evolution of the language andinadequate translation or transcribing, especially when detaileddescriptions of target plants were absent from the original texts.This notion did not escape the attention of herbal editors, asstated by Marcin de Urzedow in the introduction to his work:\u201cWe are no longer satisfied by knowledge of garden and field plants,but search for new ones in the wild, in forests, on mountains andcliffs, and even places where mountain goats reached seldom.\u201d Forthis particular reason, it was very difficult to define and isolatelocal traditional knowledge in these monographs, as medicinaluse of many ancient herbs was fully adopted and integratedinto local folk knowledge. There was, however, a speculativeevidence of an opposite flow of knowledge aboutmedicinal plantsfrom Slavic into Greco-Roman tradition: Slavic knowledge ofmedicinal plants supported the hypothesis of Tomaschek thatthe majority of so-called Dacian synonyms interpolated into theDioscorides text from the Viennese codex are of Slavic origin(Grmek, 1959).PHARMACOPEIAS THAT REGULATEDAPOTHECARY TRADITION IN THE REGION(FIFTEENTH\u2013NINETEENTH CENTURIES)The official Polish and Polish-Latin scientific literature concernedwith herbal medicines became comparatively extensive betweenfifteenth and seventeenth centuries. The first place amongearlier manuscripts from the region belongs to the volumeentitled Antidotarium seu Vocabularium medicum, passim cumnominibus herbarum Germanis et Polonis rubro adscriptis (1419),currently kept at the Jagiellonian Library in Krakow. It waslikely written by an unknown physician or monk of Germanorigin who worked in Poland and had first hand knowledge ofPolish plants (Magowska, 2004). This pharmacological work wasFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 295219Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicinesa direct adaptation from Antidotarium parvum, a pharmacopeia-like manuscript written by an unknown author in Salernobetween eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Different editions ofthis work included 110\u2013170 recipes from antiquity and earlymedieval writers, which were annotated with German and Polishnames. We also cannot rule out the possibility that some chapterswere borrowed from Antidotarium magnum, another work ofunclear origin from the twelfth century, which may have beeninitiated by Constantinus Africanus and contained 1,200 recipes(Prioreschi, 2003).Jan Stanko (Johannes Stanconis) of Luban near Wroclaw, agraduate of Padua University and a royal physician to Polish KingKazimierz Jagiellonczyk (Lisowski, 2007), compiled a botanicaland medical glossary entitled Incipit Antibolomenum BenedictiParthi in 1472 (now kept at the Archives of the Krakow CathedralChapter). He listed 20,000 scientific andmedicinal terms of Latin,Greek, Arabic, Italian and other origins, translated into German,Polish, and Czech languages. The Antibolomenum served as anapothecary index identifying 433 domestic and 90 foreign plants,219 domestic species of animals and the minerals used as theingredients of the apothecary remedies. While useful for quickidentification of medicinal ingredients and their equivalents, themanuscript was never published, and had nomajor impact on thedevelopment of the natural sciences at the time.The first printed pharmacopeia that had significant impacton the apothecary tradition of Poland was compiled bya German physician Johann Placotomus (Breitschneider)under the title of Pharmacopoeia in compendium redacta andpublished in 1560. This book was developed on the basis ofDispensatorium written by Valerius Cordus (1546). The workincluded information on individual materia medica (simples)and complex recipes for powders, pills, syrups, decoctions,ointments, and oils. It also included recipes and instructionsfor preparation of theriacs\u2013panacea-type medical concoctionsas general antidotes against poisons and infectious diseases.Another pharmacopeia was compiled by Polish physician andapothecary in Krakow, Jan Woyna of Jasienica under thetitle of Pharmacopoea Cracoviensis and published in 1683, incompilation with two other works, Experemintorum medico-chymicorum and Observationes medicochirurgico by DanielMatthia. This monograph was rather short; although it listedcirca 1,500 apothecary ingredients in alphabetical order, thedescriptions were very brief or nonexistent. Instead, multiplecross-references to other, mostly foreign pharmacopeias anddispensatoria, were provided. The only exceptions were madefor new recipes developed by the author, in which casemore detailed information on ingredients and methods ofpreparation were given. Certain new recipes were very complex,for example a novel preparation named Spiritus CastoreiCracoviensis consisted of four herbs, Castorei (locally sourcedCastor fiber), Anacardini (American Anacardium occidentale),Asa (Asa foetida from Persia or Afghanistan), and Storacis(Styrax liquidum from Asia Minor). All four monographs,however, were private publications without any official characteror certification.In spite of the fact that unification and standardization ofapothecary tradition in Europe were long overdue, the firstlegally enforced government pharmacopeia was published onlyin 1698 as Dispensatorium Brandenburgicum. This monographwas released in Latin language, contained descriptions of over1,000 apothecary ingredients, including 906 complex mixtures.The most demanding recipe was that of Theriaca Andromachithat comprised a mixture of 71 individual components. Dukeof Warsaw Frederick Augustus I made Dispensatorium arequired apothecary regulatory document for all Polish landsin 1714 under a modified title. Following the first partitionof Poland, the Carpathian foothills were divided betweenPoland and Austria, and two new pharmcopeias were publishedto regulate the apothecary practices including PharmacopoeaRegni Poloniae (1817) and Ph\u0430rm\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0430 Austrica (1820)(Table 2). These monographs contained descriptive notes onprescribedmedicines and were intended to register approved andestablished remedies (for the physician), and to provide formulaand appropriate methods of preparation (for the pharmacist).HANDWRITTEN HERBAL MANUSCRIPTSFROM THE REGION(SIXTEENTH\u2013EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES)The beginning of the seventeenth century marked a turningpoint in the use of botanicals for medicine and folk healing. Thepractices of trained physicians and apothecaries became chieflysummarized and regulated by pharmacopeias, while the localknowledge of healers and witchcraft practitioners was mainlyrestricted to oral tradition and handwritten manuscripts. Whilethe second sources often originated from the first, they weremuch less consistent. Thesemanuscripts typically borrowed frommultiple printed sources, original or translated, and accretedwith remarks and personal observations of the successiveowners. Thus, while printed herbals recommended carline thistle(Carlina acaulis) to protect children from the evil enchantmentsof the \u201cold women,\u201d the same \u201cold women\u201d often used this plantto aid in apotropaic and love magic (Ostling, 2014).One of the earliest examples of such manuscripts, recordedsomewhere in Grand Duchy of Lithuania and self-described as \u201catranslation from Latin and Polish books,\u201d was created in the midsixteenth century (designated here as Pushkarev). If the dating iscorrect, this manuscript was translated at the same time asHortussanitatis books known as \u201cvertograds\u201d were printed in Moscow(1534) and Kolomna (1588) (Novoselski and Pushkarev, 1977).The section of the manuscript that describes herbal tradition isentitled Knigi lechebnya ot mnogih lekarev sobranye o koreniah io zeliah (Medicinal books collected from many doctors). Othersections contained discussions on hygiene, Galenic commentaryon Hippocrates, notes and quotations from Avicenna and othermedieval physicians, exerts from the pseudo-Aristotle tractates,descriptions of commonmedicinal practices such as bloodletting,and magical spells. Large numbers of spelling errors, incorrectinterpretations and misrepresentations, all point to the fact thatthe manuscript was written not for personal use, but rather forsale by a professional transcriber with little knowledge on thesubject.

In hisRusskije vrachebniki work, a bibliographer of the history ofRussian medicine listed 186 such manuscripts, most fromthe seventeenth century (Zmejev, 1895). As these manuscriptswere transcribed in time, each subsequent version underwenta complex change based on the local needs and traditions,with a progressively shifting emphasis onto local and easilycollectible plants, and away from their exotic and expensivealternatives. It is therefore critical in future works to establishwhich particular plants and beliefs were incorporated intoSlavic folk healing manuscripts from European sources, whichknowledge specifically reflects oral local tradition that was fixatedin these works, and which part of the tradition was an originalcontribution of local ethnic groups. To achieve this goal, wewould need to determine and investigate independent partsof handwritten herbal manuscripts (i.e., chapter groups) thatoriginated from the common source. Another prevalent featureof these manuscripts that separated them from printed herbalswas the lack of plant illustrations or prints. Otherwise, the plantuses described in these manuscripts were correct and targetedeither a function of the human body (medicine), social life(relationships and feelings), household issues, or superstitionbeliefs (Ippolitova, 2008). With time, these descriptions becamea part of the oral local tradition, and many of medicinalprescriptions and uses were eventually transferred to otherunrelated plants.A Ruthenian handwritten manuscript from the late sixteenthcentury, also likely a translation from a Polish source, was foundin the State Archive of Bucharest (Syrku, 1883) (designatedhere as Syrku). Some of the plant descriptions from thismanuscript, for example, plantain (Plantagomajor), St. Benedict\u2019sthistle (Cnicus benedictus), Norwegian angelica (Archangelicaofficinalis), and lesser burnet (Pimpinella saxifraga) were veryclose if not identical to other subsequent manuscripts, showingcontinuation of handwritten tradition in time (Nimchuk, 1976).One of them, a Ruthenian herbal manuscript Kniha lechebnaya omnogih lekarstv, dated to the mid seventeenth century, survivedin the Swidzinski collection from Sanok area (Peredrijenko,1984) (designated here as Swidzinski). This manuscript wasa compilation of various texts, legends, poems, and prayersin addition to herbal tradition. The territory to which themanuscript was localized, had formed a border line between twoethnic groups of Ruthenian origin, Boyko in the east and Lemkoin the west (Falkowski and Pasznycki, 1935). Both ethnic groupsstill maintain a deep tradition in collecting and consuming avariety of wild plants. Among those, berries, mushrooms andhazelnuts are most popular. Several reorganizations, includingthe deletions of nonessential magical sections, and additions ofimportant material about the habitat and preparation of theplant, were evident from this manuscript. We must thereforepostulate, that the original knowledge about the medicinalproperties of the herbs that was fixated in the earlier printedherbals, became amorphous and open to interpretation whenit entered oral and written tradition of common people in theseventeenth-eighteenth centuries.ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF THECARPATHIAN FOOTHILLS(NINETEENTH\u2013TWENTIETH CENTURIES)While political and economic transformations took place at thelowlands of Poland and Ukraine, the people who inhabited theCarpathian ridges of the Beskid Mountains saw little change anddependedmostly on cheap and readily available traditional herbalmedicines for the poorest. By that time, the combined knowledgeof printed herbals and handwritten manuscripts was deeplyrooted in the oral tradition of folk remedies (Figure 2). Thisfusion was so profound, that most of the ethnographic studiesof the region that took place in nineteenth and early twentiethcentury recorded and transcribed traditional folk medicines asa part of local cultural and ethnographic \u201cheritage.\u201d The riseFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 295221Kozlowska et al.

Black squares indicate theemergence of handwritten herbal mauscripts including Pushkarev (1) and Swidzinski (2), as well as ethnobotanical surveys of Rostafinski (3) and Fisher (4) discussedin this study.of alternative medicines in these areas could be interpretedas one of many signs of poor development and often of aneconomic decline of the region. The inaccessibility and sometimeactive rejection of medicine, the acceptance of simplistic medicalnotions, and the reliance on imaginary observations indicateda loss of confidence in empirical observations and a pessimisticview of the capacity of men to overcome external difficulties byreason (Prioreschi, 2000).Early ethnographic studies in the region were generaldescriptive compilations of oral traditional medicines recordedby Ukrainian and Polish enthusiasts without further analysis orcomparison to the previous written works on the subject.DanyloChomych Lepki described Boyko women from mountainareas who treated skin disorders in babies with herbal bathsthat included a mixture of pasqueflower (Pulsatilla patens),cornflower (Centaurea cyanus), rue (Ruta graveolens) and lesserperiwinkle (Vinca minor), as well as the use of infusionsfrom the bark of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and mezereon(Daphne mezereum) in love magic (Lepkij, 1884). OskarKolberg, a Polish ethnographer, observed the traditional use ofthyme (Thymus serpyllum), milk thistle (Silybum marianum),scentless chamomile (Anthemis arvensis), chamomile (Matricariachamomilla), wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), galipot (Piceaalba), a mixture of water and burned aspen (Populus tremula)for treatment of osteomyelitis, and a fermented mixture ofoat hulls and goose feces for treatment of abscesses amongthe inhabitants of the Carpathian foothills (Kolberg, 1888).Ivan Kuziw, a Greek-Catholic priest from Boyko villages Likotand Dydiowa, noted an unusual method of making infusionsof valerian roots. They were placed in glass bottle, coveredwith alcohol, and baked inside a breadloaf (Kuziw, 1889).Julian Talko-Hryncewicz described 360 medicinal plants usedin Ukrainian lowlands (Talko-Hryncewicz, 1893). Ivan Franko,an Ukrainian poet and ethnographer of Boyko origin, publishedseveral collections of his ethnographic observations of Boykopeople, including their use of herbal medicines in magic andprotection (Franko, 1898), including blessed chalk, salt, fieldpoppy (Papaver rhoeas), zillya troyan (a mixture of Levisticumofficinale, Vinca minor, and Ocimum basilicum), and garlicmustard (Alliaria petiolata).Volodymyr Szuchewycz, an Ukrainian ethnographer andteacher residing in Lviv, observed extensive use of traditionalherbal medicines by Hutsuls (a neighboring ethnic group ofRuthenian origin to the east of Boykos) and described some ofthe remedies in the 5th volume of his monograph (Szuchewycz,1908), including the widely used comfrey (Symphytum officinale),yarrow (Achillea millefolium), marsh woundwort (Stachyspalustris), mistletoe (Viscum album), and yellow gentian(Gentiana lutea). Josef Schneider, a Polish ethnographerborn in Stebnyk, documented the use of herbal remedies byBoyko people from the Dolyna region (Schneider, 1912). Henoted use of bath prepared with aspen (Populus tremula)and periwinkle (Vinca minor) for treatment of various skindisorders, baked onion (Allium cepa) for alleviation of abscess,green cones from spruce (Picea abies) for syphilis, flowerpetals for leg pain, and decoction of beet (Beta vulgaris)Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 295222Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicinesleaves for ringworm. Jan Falkowski, a Polish ethnographer,described treatment of the Polish plait (plica polonica, irreversiblyentangled moist damaged hair) with chorne zillya (Pulsatillavulgaris). Tinctures made with yellow gentian (Gentiana lutea)were a popular remedy against cholera. Special attention waspaid to ashes of burned medicinal plants. Cataracts weretreated by burning periwinkle (Vinca minor) and using theashes to wash the eyes. Burn wounds were treated withashes from burned wool or black ligules of sedge (Schoenusnigricans). Open cut wounds were treated with juice from yarrow(Achillea millefolium) (Falkowski and Pasznycki, 1935). Severalmore recent ethnographical monographs provided comparativeanalysis of previously published traditional knowledge andcultural differences of Boyko people, including limited data onBoyko herbal remedies. As such, they are not discussed here(Kyrchiv, 1978; Boltarovych, 1980; Hoshko, 1983). Throughoutthe twentieth century, there was a steady growth of publishedbooks on Ukrainian medicinal plants that also containedfragmented information on the topic from Beskids. Three ofthem had a particular influence on the folk knowledge of thelocal medicinal plants (Nosal and Nosal, 1962; Komedar, 1971;Tovstuha, 1990).Gorale from Silesian Beskids used sap from crushed goldmossstonecrop (Sedum acre) to treat ulcers. Crude, crushed herb wasapplied for heel pain or, if mixed with fat, into the ear to reduceearache. In Sacz Beskids it was also used internally to treat fluor urinary tract diseases. Its relaxant and emetic properties wereused in food poisoning. Sedum maximum leaves were appliedexternally crude or crushed on ulcers, bruises or edema. Sap of itsleaves was mixed with barley flour and as a plaster applied to slowhealing wounds (Tylkowa, 1989). On the border of SandomierzBasin and Central Beskidian Piedmont, wound healing propertiesof Sedum were also known. It was applied in cataplasms orointments, when fried with Thymus serpyllum in unsalted porkfat. Additionally, Gorale used its decoction in mouth rinsingas a gum strengthening agent or as a remedy to \u201cdestroy thescurvy impurities.\u201d Among Gorales, several different plants hadthe dialect name \u201cnine forces\u201d but the most famous one wascarline thistle (Carlina acaulis). The Silesian Beskids inhabitantsused it both internally and externally. Its root boiled with milkor water and drank once a day on empty stomach was used inkidney and bladder disease. Leaves were put on ulcers becauseof its properties of getting pus out. Moreover, herb infusion wasused internally to treat colic and stitching pain (Tylkowa, 1989).It is critical to note that historical handwritten manuscriptsand ethnographic studies reported equal if not larger useof verbal spells (Ua: zagovor, Pl: zamawianie), charm heals,and whispering prayers to treat diseases and cast magicalincantations (Figure 3A). This knowledge was often cultureand language specific, and most likely truly represented theoriginal healing tradition that predated Roman and Greektherapies. The herbal remedies, however, were either substitutedin their entirety by the knowledge gathered from translationof mostly Roman medicine, directly or via Italy and Germany,or were so similar that they could not be distinguished. Thisoverlap though was never complete due to endemic plantspecies in the region, which were unknown to Greeks andRomans, and therefore could provide an exciting opportunityto observe pre-Christian folk healing traditions from theCarpathian Mountains. Guelder rose (Viburnum opulus) couldbe of particular interest in this matter as it was largely unusedby the Western cultures. Similarly, the endemic species ofArran whitebeam (Sorbus arranensis), unknown in Romanhealing tradition, was used as an antimicrobial remedy in theScottish Highlands (Wagner et al., 2017). Previously, it wasreported that the Bulgarian flora comprises 3,900 species, 12.8%of which are endemics (Petrova, 2005). Assuming a similarratio of endemic plant species in the Ukrainian flora (6,086FIGURE 3 | Botanical provenance of medicinal plants from the Carpathian Mountains: (A) Traditional healer from Eastern Carpathians as documented by HenrykGasiorowski at the beginning of the twentieth century, and botanical profiles of major (B) imported and (C) exported medicinal plants from Ukraine in 2014 (afterNykytyuk, 2015).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 295223Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicinesspecies), we could expect at least 600 endemic species, ofwhich at least 200 species could potentially contain biologicallyactive components and be used medicinally (Konischuk et al.,2016).SURVEYS THAT DOCUMENTEDTRADITIONAL USES OF PLANTS IN THEREGIONApart from the observational ethnographic studies, we are alsoaware of two attempts to collect and analyze ethnographicaldata on local use of herbal remedies in the Beskid regionby mailed or published questionnaires of Rostafinski in 1883(K\u00f6hler, 2015) and Fischer in 1929\u20131934 (Kujawska et al.,2015), both addressed to Polish speakers. Nearly 370 individualsreplied to the first enquiry and 290 filecards were collected inthe second call from the geographical region of our interest.Rostafinski\u2019s informants returned nearly 800 records of plantsused by traditional societies for medical purposes. The mostextensive version consisted of 70 questions concerning about130 species. It was formulated in greater detail and askedspecifically what names people used for cultivated plants,medicinal remedies (curative, ceremonial and magic plants),mushrooms, and timber. The information on the medical useof various plants obtained by Rostafinski showed that traditionalhomemade remedies had not yet been substituted by chemicalmedicines prepared by pharmacists at the time of the survey(K\u00f6hler, 2015).Fischer\u2019s survey reported 179 plant taxa from the Galiciaregion. However, only 87 (49%) of them were used as medicinesand targeted predominantly respiratory (24), digestive (24), andskin (23) illnesses. The remaining herbs (53 or 30%) wereused for blessing during various religious ceremonies (Kujawskaet al., 2015). The species that achieved the highest use wereyarrow (Achillea millefolium), garlic (Allium sativum), periwinkle(Vinca minor), St. John\u2019s wort (Hypericum perforatum), andjuniper (Juniperus communis), which was strictly in line withprevious observations across various centuries. Two plants,yarrow (Achillea millefolium) and coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara)were also recognized as the most versatile remedies with multiplepharmacological indications.COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MEDICINALPLANTS FOR WOUND AND SKINAPPLICATIONSTo illustrate our assumption that the original Carpathian herbalremedies were either substituted by knowledge gathered fromclassical medicinal monographs or were identical to them,we attempted a direct comparison of descriptions of herbalmedicines used to treat wounds among printed herbals andsubsequent traditional folk knowledge in the region. Falimirz\u2019sherbal (1534) listed 63 plants that were used for woundhealing out of 246 plants shown in Table 3 (25%). Amongthe herbal references analyzed, Falimirz\u2019s plant list matches70% of plants described in the Welsh (Celtic) Physicians ofMyddvai manuscript, even though both works are separated bya hundred years and 2,000 km\u2013suggesting that both authorsused similar, if not identical, sources for transcribing thesemonographs. This striking similarity could be explained in partby the fact that medieval Celtic physicians (Scottish, Irish, andWelsh) often received education at the University of Padua,similar to their Ruthenian and Polish counterparts (ScottishHistorical review, 1906). Subsequent handwritten manuscriptsand surveys reported both smaller numbers of total medicinalplants, as well as those used for wound healing. Only 3 plantspecies are recommended to treat wounds across all 6 sourcesstudied, including derevij (Achillea millefolium), babka (Plantagomaior) and shalvia (Salvia officinalis), but at least 14 plantsare shared among the majority of the sources. Comfrey root(Symphytum officinale) was used on multiple occasions to healwounds associated with bone fractures, minced in animal fat. Thetype of fat used in this ointment varied depending on the location:in Silesian Beskids, pork fat was preffered, in Zywiec Beskids,goose lard was believed to possess the best curative properties,while in Sacz Beskids they were both considered as effective.Another treatment that remained largerly uniform among thediscussed regions was application of galipot of conifer trees towound healing ointments after heating it with bee wax andbutter.MODERN PRODUCTION AND USE OFMEDICINAL HERBS IN THE REGIONWorldwide, around 20,000 plant species are used for theirmedicinal properties, including 180 herbs that are recognizedas medicinal by modern medicine. The annual market needfor herbal and botanical raw materials is estimated at 600,000tons, with sales reaching $7.5 billion in the United Statesalone, and $60 billion worlwide. Cultivation of medicinal plantsremains a fast growing and sustainable section of agriculture,with profits margins exceeding those of grains and otherfood crops 2 to 50-fold due to development of value-adddedproducts and parallel processing streams of raw materials andwaste products. Low costs of intitial investment into growing,processing, and packaging medicinal herbs in Eastern Europe(<$ 10,000) is also a very attractive factor, however it ispartially offset by lack of modern cultivation practices anddelayed returns due to intial 2 to 3-year establishment ofannual crop harvest (Mirzoyeva, 2013). Russia remains thelargest producer of medicinal plants in the region, with Poland(cultivated herbs) and Bulgaria (wild collected herbs) in thesecond place. Ukrainian market of medicinal plants is rathersmall, with annual exports (averaging 3,000 tons) exceedingimports (averaging 2,000 tons) in most years (Nykytyuk,2015). Botanical imports are largerly dominated by chamomile(Matricaria chamomilla) and senna (Senna alexandrina), whilechestnut (Castanea sativa), buckthorn (Frangula alnus), andmilk thistle (Silybum marianum) are leading exports in recentyears (Figures 3B,C). This is a drastic difference from 1920s,when the same region was one of the world leaders in growing,processing, and exporting medicinal plants, predominantly forFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 295224Kozlowska et al.

A current well-demonstrated,long-term trend toward natural medicine and consumers isindicative of increasing interest in botanical products thatsupport whole-body health rather than focus on a specifichealth condition, representing a key opportunity to adequatelytap the potential of agriculture- and forest-grown medicinaland aromatic plants of the Carpathian Mountains and theirforeland.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 295230Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal MedicinesCONCLUSIONSThe first printed herbals published in the Carpathian forelandswere early compilations of transcribed Greek and Roman workson the subject, and set a continuous trend of ethnic use oflocal botanical remedies according to their Dioscorides andGalenic qualities. The Padua-Krakow axis was identified asa key putative factor in introduction of this knowledge toRuthenian and Polish medical students during the fifteenth\u2013sixteenth centuries. Subsequently, this tradition was incorporatedinto oral and written legacy of Boyko, Lemko, and Goraleethnic groups, and fused with Slavic use of charm and prayerheals to treat diseases and cast magical incantations. However,the traditional use of several endemic plant species in theregion could provide an exciting opportunity to observe pre-Christian folk healing traditions from the Beskid Mountains.The study also highlighted the vast potential for growingand processing medicinal plants in the region, and cited lowawareness among farming communities, inadequate processingcapacities, price risks, and non-availability of planting material ascritical constraints that need to be addressed.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSWKdrafted ethnobiology sections of themanuscript.

Therefore, the composition ofthis extract was studied in an activity-guided approach. Since no data on the secondarymetabolites of this plant were available, first phytochemical data were collected in thecourse of the fractionation of the extract. The study resulted in the identification of 14substances, among them very rare iridoids, such as scrovalentinoside or koelzioside,and several flavonoids (e.g., nepitrin and homoplantaginin). One of the latter group,2\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin, is a new natural compound. In the most active fraction,the flavonoid hispidulin was identified as major component and the assay of thepure compound confirmed a contribution of hispidulin to the CCID-inhibitory effectsof S. lucida. The activity of the two major iridoids in this assay was less compared tohispidulin.Keywords: Scrophularia lucida L., iridoids, phenolic compounds, 2\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin, hispidulin,intravasation, circular chemorepellent-induced defects (CCID) assayINTRODUCTIONSpecies of the genus Scrophularia have been applied for centuries in traditional medicine.The most important one among those, Scrophularia ningpoensis Hemsl., is widely used intraditional Chinese medicine for a broad spectrum of inflammatory diseases (De SantosGal\u00edndez et al., 2002; Tong et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009) and listed in the ChinesePharmacopeia against febrile diseases with excessive thirst or eruptions, constipation, coughdue to exhaustion, conjunctivits, skin disorders, and others (St\u00f6ger, 2017).

Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assaytreatment of inflammatory disorders, wound healing, skinailments, and health disturbances has been reported fornumerous species such as Scrophularia auriculata L. orScrophularia canina L. from the Mediterranean area (Giner et al.,2000; Guarrera and Lucia, 2007; Passalacqua et al., 2007) as well asfor Scrophularia variegata M. Bieb. and Scrophularia striata Boiss.in traditional Iranian medicine (Azadmehr et al., 2013, 2015).A traditional use as an antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agentwas described for Scrophularia oldhamii Oliv. and as a diuretic forScrophularia grossheimii Schischkin (De Santos Gal\u00edndez et al.,2002). In Turkish traditional medicine, the species Scrophularianodosa L. is well-known as a diuretic, to treat hemorrhoids, andalso for wound healing, eruptive skin diseases, eczema, psoriasis,and pruritus (Baytop, 1999; Stevenson et al., 2002; Crisan et al.,2009). A use in these indications is also conveyed for the Turkishspecies Scrophularia depauperata Boiss., Scrophularia cryptophilaBoiss. et. Heldr. Boiss., and Scrophularia floribunda Boiss. et. Bal.(Ozbilgin et al., 2014).Recently, the activity of various extracts from severalScrophularia species has been studied in different cancer models:weak cytotoxic activity of an ethanolic extract from S. striatavia induction of apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest was shownin Jurkat human leukemia cells (Azadmehr et al., 2013). InWEHI 164 fibrosarcoma cells, a methanolic extract of this plantexhibited a significant and dose-dependent reduction of theactivity of matrix metalloproteinases (Hajiaghaee et al., 2007),which play a role in tissue remodeling and tumor invasion.An apolar fraction from a methanolic extract of Scrophulariaorientalis L. significantly reduced the viability of neuroblastomacells due to a loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity (Langeet al., 2016). In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, weak cytotoxicity of anethanolic extract from S. variegata was reported (Azadmehr et al.,2015). A dichloromethane extract from Scrophularia oxysepalacaused significant cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in MCF-7 cellsby influencing the expression of p53, caspase 3, and c-myc, andthe cleavage of PARP (Valiyari et al., 2013). The anti-tumoractivity of S. oxysepala in breast cancer was confirmed in vivo inan allograft model in mice inoculated with mammary carcinoma4T1 cells. Animals treated with 50 or 100 mg/kg of an ethanolicextract developed significantly smaller tumors in size and weight(Baradaran et al., 2017). In a study of five Scrophularia species,S. floribunda and Scrophularia lucida L. displayed the highestcytotoxic activity against HL-60 promyeloic leukemia cells. Theseextracts were also tested in a three-dimensional co-culture cellmodel consisting of MCF-7 breast cancer spheroids placed on topof telomerase-immortalized human lymph endothelial cell (LEC)monolayers. There, tumor spheroids cause the formation of largecell-free areas in the lymph endothelial barrier, so-called \u201ccircularchemorepellent induced defects\u201d (CCIDs), through which tumorcells penetrate the vasculature. This assay mimics intravasationwhich is an early step within the metastatic cascade resemblingthe pathological situation in rodents and humans (Madleneret al., 2010; Vonach et al., 2011; Viola et al., 2013). A detannifiedmethanolic extract of S. lucida L. was the most active one insuppressing CCID formation (Giessrigl et al., 2012).The lack of any information about the chemical compositionof S. lucida prompted us to perform an activity-guided search forthe active principle of this species contributing to the inhibitoryeffect in the CCID assay.EXPERIMENTALGeneral Experimental ProceduresHispidulin was obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich. All otherflavonoids for dereplication were on stock at the Department ofPharmacognosy, University of Vienna.For TLC, silica gel plates or HPTLC plates RP-8 (Merck,Germany) and the mobile phases (1) CHCl3\u2013CH3COOHconc.\u2013MeOH\u2013H2O (60:32:12:18), (2) EtOAc\u2013HCOOHconc.\u2013CH3COOHconc.\u2013H2O (100:11:11:20), (3) EtOAc\u2013MeOH\u2013HCOOHconc.\u2013H2O (75:15:4:4), or (4) MeOH\u2013H2O (90:10)were used.A Shimadzu LC-20AD pump, an SPD M20A diode arraydetector, a CTO-20AC column oven, and a SIL 20AC HTauto-sampler (Kyoto, Japan) served for analytical HPLC on aLuna 5 \u00b5 C-18 (250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm) column (Phenomenex,United States) at 25\u25e6C and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Mobilephase 1 consisted of (A) aqueous formic acid (pH 3) and (B)acetonitrile-aqueous formic acid (pH 3; 80+2) and the gradientprogram 1 was 5% B (0 min), 20% B (15 min), 20% B (25 min),50% B (65 min), and 95% B (80 min). Mobile phase 2 was (A)aqueous formic acid (pH 3) and (B) acetonitrile and the gradient2 increased from 5% B (0 min) to 95% B (60 min). UV datawere recorded from 190 to 400 nm. All solvents of analytical orHPLC-grade (acetonitrile, Chromanorm; methanol, LiChrosolv)were obtained from VWR International (West Chester, PA,United States) and CH3COOHconc. (Rotichrom) from Carl Roth(Karlsruhe, Germany).NMR spectra were recorded on an Avance III 600 MHzNMR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Germany) using a 5 mmbroadband observe probe (BBFO Smart probe) with z-axisgradients and automatic tuning and matching accessory;resonance frequency for 1H NMR: 600.13 MHz, for 13C NMR:150.90 MHz. The measurements were performed for solutionsin fully deuterated DMSO or methanol at 298 K. Standard1D and 2D experiments like double quantum filtered COSY,TOCSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC were used as supplied bythe manufacturer. Chemical shifts were referenced internally tothe residual, non-deuterated solvent signal for 1H (\u03b4 = 2.50 ppmfor DMSO, \u03b4 = 3.31 ppm for methanol) or to the carbon signalof the solvent for 13C (\u03b4 = 39.52 for DMSO, \u03b4 = 49.00 ppm formethanol). The analysis of the 1H NMR multiplett structureswas assisted by spin simulations using DAISY within the TopspinSoftware (Bruker BioSpin).LC\u2013MS analyses were carried out on an UltiMate 3000 RSLC-series system (Dionex, Germering, Germany) coupled to a 3Dquadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer via an orthogonal ESIsource (HCT, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The HPLCparameters were as described above. The eluate flow was split1:4 before entering the ESI ion source, which was operated asfollows: capillary voltage: +3.5/\u22123.7 kV, nebulizer: 26 psi (N2),dry gas flow: 9 L/min (N2), and dry temperature: 340\u25e6C.

Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assayobtained in automated data-dependent acquisition mode usinghelium as collision gas, an isolation window of 1m/z = 4, anda fragmentation amplitude of 1.0 V. In addition, compounds13 and 14 were measured on the HCT instrument by directinfusion after addition of ammonium acetate as additive togenerate [M+NH4]+ ions. HRESIMS spectra of compound 3were recorded on a maXis HD ESI-Qq-TOF mass spectrometer(Bruker Daltonics) by direct infusion. The sum formulas ofthe detected ions were determined using Bruker CompassDataAnalysis 4.2 based on the mass accuracy (1m/z \u2264 2 ppm)and isotopic pattern matching (SmartFormula algorithm).Plant MaterialAerial parts of S. lucida were collected on April 20th 2012, alongthe Mediterranean coast east of Dalyan and south of Ortaca(latitude: 36.808838, longitude: 28.735583). The material wasauthenticated by Dr. \u00d6zkan Eren, Department of Biology, AdnanMenderes University, using the serial \u201cFlora of Turkey and theEast Aegean Islands\u201d (Davis, 1968\u20131985). Voucher specimen(Herbarium code: AYDN No.: 2601) in duplicates was depositedin the herbarium of Department of Biology, Adnan MenderesUniversity.Extraction and IsolationThe freeze-dried and pulverized material of S. lucida (1.8 kg) wasextracted with methanol at the ratio of 1:10 at room temperatureby maceration on a shaker overnight. The combined solutionswere evaporated at 40\u25e6C resulting in 158 g crude methanolextract; 140 g of the extract were fractionated in four portions,whereby each portion was dissolved in 300 mL MeOH\u2013H2O(10:1) and partitioned three times with 300 mL petroleumether, each, to remove chlorophyll, waxes, and fatty matters.The MeOH\u2013H2O phase was then diluted with 300 mL H2Oand partitioned with three times 600 mL chloroform. Afterwashing the organic layer with 1% aqueous NaCl solution andevaporation, 15.6 g chloroform fraction (CF) was obtained. Fromthe remaining MeOH\u2013H2O fraction, MeOH was removed andthe aqueous residue partitioned with three times 280 mL ethylacetate, resulting in 12.3 g ethyl acetate fraction (EF) and 110.2 gaqueous fraction (AF) after evaporation.Ten grams of EF were separated by column chromatography(CC; 3 cm\u00d7 60 cm) on Sephadex LH-20 under elution with 50%MeOH yielding 15 combined fractions (a\u2013o). In fractions k andl, compound 1 was identified by TLC and LC-DAD. Fractionse (1 g) and g (580 mg) were further fractionated on the samestationary phase under elution with 30% MeOH, resulting infractions e1\u2013e22 and g1\u2013g19. From fraction e18, 46.5 mg ofcompound 2 precipitated. Solid phase extraction (Megabond ElutC18 cartridge; 12 mL; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, United States;sequential elution with 20, 30, 40, and 50% MeOH) of fractione22 resulted in the isolation of compound 3 (7 mg) and theidentification of compound 4. A major component from fractiong6 (63.2 mg) was finally purified by another CC on SephadexLH-20 under elution with H2O to yield 27 mg compound 5. Infraction g10, compounds 6 and 7 were identified, and in fractiong19, compound 8 was confirmed.FIGURE 1 | MCF-7 spheroids pre-treated for 30 min with solvent (Co) orindicated concentration of different fractions, placed on top of LECmonolayers, and co-cultivated for 4 h when CCIDs were analyzed. Threeindependent experiments with at least 15 replicates were analyzed. Error barsindicate means \u00b1 SEM and asterisks significance (t-test).A portion of CF (3.9 g) was submitted to CC on silicaand elution with CHCl3\u2013MeOH\u2013H2O (75:15:1.5), resulting in25 fractions, five of which (A\u2013E) were further investigated. Infraction A (62.5 mg), compound 9 was identified as the majorcomponent. In fraction B (150.8 mg), three major compounds(10\u201312) besides 8 were detected and tentatively identified byLC\u2013MS. From fraction C (150.9 mg), compound 13 (144.7 mg)and from fraction D (630.5 mg), compound 14 (532 mg) wereobtained. Fraction E (125.9 mg) contained a complex mixture ofeasy decomposable substances and attempts to isolate those byCC were not successful.Astragalin (1): Rf in TLC: system 1 = 0.50; system 2 = 0.74.Homoplantaginin (2): yellowish amorphouspowder;1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data: see Table 1;+ESIMS m/z 463.1 [M+H]+; +ESIMS2 (463.1\u2192)m/z 301.3 (100); +ESIMS3 (463.1 \u2192 301.3 \u2192) m/z 286.3(100); +ESIMS4 (463.1 \u2192 301.3 \u2192 286.3 \u2192) m/z 240.1 (10),186.2 (28), 168.3 (100), 167.1 (11), 121.5 (25), and 120.5 (14);\u2212ESIMS m/z 461.0 [M\u2212H]\u2212; \u2212ESIMS2 (461.0 \u2192) m/z 446.2(45), 299.2 (100), 298.2 (17), 297.2 (16), 285.2 (20), 284.2 (73),and 283.2 (57); \u2212ESIMS3 (461.0\u2192 299.2\u2192) m/z 284.2 (100);and \u2212ESIMS3 (461.0\u2192 284.2\u2192) m/z 255.2 (100), 239.1 (10),227.1 (51), 211.1 (21), 183.1 (11), and 137.2 (11).2\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin (3): yellowish amorphouspowder;1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data: see Table 1; +ESIMS m/z505.0 [M+H]+; +ESIMS2 (505.0\u2192) m/z 301.3 (100); +ESIMS3(505.0\u2192 301.3\u2192) m/z 286.3 (100); +ESIMS4 (505.0\u2192 301.3\u2192 286.3\u2192) m/z 186.1 (18), 168.3 (100), 140.2 (20), and 121.4Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 304235fphar-09-00304 March 28, 2018 Time: 17:7 # 4Lewenhofer et al.

After subsequent partition with chloroform and ethylacetate, the two organic fractions and the residue of the aqueousphase were tested in the CCID assay. The crude methanol extractsignificantly and linearly inhibited CCID formation betweenconcentrations of 0.25\u20131 mg/mL (Figure 1). At a concentrationof 0.25 mg/mL, the CF seemed to be even more effective than0.25 mg/mL of the methanol extract; however, this differencewas not significant. The EF was only active at 1 mg/mL and theAF was inactive at the tested concentrations. Therefore, the CFFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 304237fphar-09-00304 March 28, 2018 Time: 17:7 # 6Lewenhofer et al. Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assaywas chosen for further separation by CC on silica and five ofthe resulting sub-fractions (A\u2013E) were active in the CCID assaywith sub-fraction A exhibiting the strongest inhibition (Figure 2).The EF was separated by size exclusion chromatography followedby solid phase extraction or another subsequent size exclusionchromatography. Due to the lower activity of the EF in theCCID assay, these sub-fractions were submitted to chemicalinvestigations only.The processes resulted in the elucidation of 14 compounds,one of which is a new natural product (Figure 3). The 13known compounds were identified by chromatographic, massspectrometric and/or spectroscopic dereplication with authenticsamples or data from literature. This led to the elucidation ofseven flavonoids. The widespread natural compounds astragalin(1), luteolin-7-O-glucoside (8), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (6),and rutin (7) were confirmed by TLC- and LC-DAD comparisonwith the authentic substances. To the best of our knowledge,only the two latter have been reported in the genus Scrophulariauntil now, namely, in Scrophularia ilwensis C. Koch (Calis et al.,1993). Two further, less prevalent flavonoids, nepitrin (4) andhomoplantaginin (2), had been isolated from S. ningpoensis (Liet al., 2009) and nepitrin also from S. striata (Monsef-Esfahaniet al., 2010) before. 1H-NMR- and 13C-NMR data of 2 correlatedexcellently with the data published earlier for homoplantaginin(Wang et al., 1998; Dawa et al., 2009). Hispidulin (9) was detectedfor the first time in a Scrophularia species and elucidated byLC-DAD comparison and LC\u2013MS data.A new flavonoid (3) was identified by thorough MS and NMRexperiments: a molecular formula of C24H24O12 was determinedfrom the HRESIMS data. Fragmentation of the [M+H]+ ionat m/z 505.0 showed the loss of a 204 Da to yield a Y0 ionat m/z 301.3, which again lost a CH\u20223 in MS3, typical for amethoxy group bound to an aromatic system. The MS2, MS3, andMS4 spectra were nearly identical to those of homoplantaginin.Fragmentation of the [M\u2212H]\u2212 ion at m/z 503.0 confirmed thisinformation. In addition, the loss of 60 Da (CH3COOH) inMS2 indicated acetylation of the glucose of homoplantaginin.The signals of 3 in the 1H-NMR spectrum excellently correlatedwith those of compound 2 (Table 1), despite a large downfieldshift of the proton at C-2\u2032\u2032 in the sugar for 1.55 ppm. Thesignals of the protons at C-1\u2032\u2032 and C-3\u2032\u2032 were shifted downfieldfor 0.24 and 0.22 ppm, respectively, as well. Additionally, fromthe singlet at \u03b4 = 2.038 ppm, linkage of an acetyl group wasdeduced. The connection of an additional acetyl group in position2\u2032\u2032 of homoplantaginin was confirmed by the 13C-NMR data.The signals of C-1\u2032\u2032 and C-3\u2032\u2032 were shifted upfield for 2.28 andTABLE 1 | 1H NMR and 13C NMR data of compounds 2 and 3 in DMSO-d6.Compound 2 Compound 3Position 1H (ppm) JH.H (Hz) 13C (ppm) 1H (ppm) JH.H (Hz) 13C (ppm)2 C \u2013 \u2013 164.3 \u2013 \u2013 164.43 CH 6.86 s 102.7 6.87 s 102.74 C \u2013 \u2013 182.3 \u2013 \u2013 182.34a C \u2013 \u2013 105.7 \u2013 \u2013 106.15 C \u2013 \u2013 152.5 \u2013 \u2013 152.6OH 12.96 s \u2013 12.97 s \u20136 C \u2013 \u2013 132.5 \u2013 \u2013 132.5CH3 3.77 s 60.3 3.65 s 60.27 C \u2013 \u2013 156.5 \u2013 \u2013 155.98 CH 7.02 94.3 7.03 s 94.78a C \u2013 \u2013 152.1 \u2013 \u2013 152.01\u2032 C \u2013 \u2013 121.0 \u2013 \u2013 120.92\u2032/6\u2032 CH 7.95 d 8.8 128.6 7.94 d 8.9 128.63\u2032/5\u2032 CH 6.94 d 8.8 116.0 6.94 d 8.9 116.04\u2032 C \u2013 \u2013 161.4 \u2013 \u2013 161.51\u2032\u2032 CH 5.11 d 7.1 100.2 5.35 d 8.1 97.92\u2032\u2032 CH 3.34 dd 7.1/9.6 73.2 4.89 dd 8.1/9.6 73.3C \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 169.3CH3 \u2013 \u2013 2.04 s 20.83\u2032\u2032 CH 3.32 dd 9.6/9.2 76.7 3.54 dd 9.6/9.1 73.84\u2032\u2032 CH 3.21 dd 9.2/9.6 69.5 3.31 dd 9.1/9.7 69.65\u2032\u2032 CH 3.47 ddd 9.6/ 6.0/2.1 77.3 3.58 ddd 9.7/6.0/2.1 77.56\u2032\u2032a CH2 3.73 dd 2.1/11.6 60.6 3.77 dd 2.1/11.8 60.4b 3.49 dd 6.0/11.6 3.53 dd 6.0/11.8Further OH signals 10.405.435.124.6310.435.394.77Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 304238fphar-09-00304 March 28, 2018 Time: 17:7 # 7Lewenhofer et al. Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assay2.95 ppm, respectively. Signals of an acetyl group occurred at\u03b4 = 169.26 ppm (quarternary C) and \u03b4 = 20.82 ppm (methyl C).An HMBC crosspeak from the CH3 protons to the C-2\u2032\u2032 finallyproofed the connectivity. Thus, compound 3 was unambiguouslyidentified as 2\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin.The phenylpropanoid verbascoside, which had been detectedin many species of the Scrophulariaceae family (see, e.g., Zhanget al., 2013; Pasdaran et al., 2016, 2017; Venditti et al., 2016), wasisolated from S. lucida as well and identified by HPLC-DAD andMS.The genus is well-known for synthesizing a broad rangeof iridoids (De Santos Gal\u00edndez et al., 2002) and two suchcompounds were isolated from and two further ones tentativelyidentified in the CF.The major iridoid was scrovalentinoside (14). The compoundwas elucidated by MS and NMR experiments (see SupplementaryMaterial). The spectroscopic data were in excellent accordancewith those published after isolation of the compound fromS. auriculata L. ssp. pseudoauriculata (Senn.) Bol\u00f3s et Vigo(Giner et al., 1998) and from S. nodosa L. (Miyase and Mimatsu,1999). A second iridoid was unambiguously elucidated askoelzioside (13) based on MS experiments and the analogyof the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data as reported for thecompound, until now only known from Scrophularia koelziiL. (Bhandari et al., 1992) and Scrophularia deserti Del.(Ahmed et al., 2003). Tentatively identified by thorough LC\u2013MSexperiments were two isomers of buergeriside C1 (10 and 11),known from Scrophularia buergeriana (Miquel) (Kim andKim, 2000), and 6-O-(2\u2032\u2032-acetyl-3\u2032\u2032,4\u2032\u2032-di-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl-catalpol (scropolioside B, 12), reportedin Scrophularia scopolii [Hoppe ex] Pers. var. scopolii (Caliset al., 1988). Compounds 10 and 11 both showed a UVspectrum typical for a para-substituted cinnamic acid derivativeand yielded identical fragment ions, although the relativeintensities were different in the MS2 spectra of the [M+COOH]\u2212ion of 10 and 11. Fragmentation of the [M\u2212H2O+H]+ion yielded the acylium ion of methoxycinnamic acid (Z0),while CID of the [M+COOH]\u2212 ion produced deprotonatedmethoxycinnamic acid (Y0), dehydrated deoxyhexose (B1),and typical cross-ring cleavage of the deoxyhexose. Fromthe compounds described for the genus Scrophularia, thispattern only fits to buergeriside C1, why we have tentativelyidentified 10 and 11 as buergeriside C1 isomers. The UVspectrum of 12 points toward cinnamic acid. Fragmentationof the [M\u2212H]\u2212 ion (resulting from CID of the [M+COOH]\u2212ion) yielded the neutral loss of 60, 148, and 162 Da, fittingto an acetylated, cinnamoylated, and hexosylated compound.Scropolioside B is the only previously described compoundin the genus Scrophularia being in accordance with thesedata. All iridoids detected in S. lucida are very rare naturalcompounds.The quantitative determination by HPLC of themajor compounds in the methanolic extract revealed 3%homoplantaginin, 1.4% scrovalentinoside, and 0.7% koelzioside.In an earlier study, 20 \u00b5g/mL of the methanolic extract ofS. lucida was reported to induce 70% apoptosis and to almostcompletely inhibit proliferation of HL-60 cells in S-phase within48 and 72 h, respectively (Giessrigl et al., 2012). Here, wedemonstrate that 250 \u00b5g/mL of the methanolic extract inhibits60% CCID formation in the MCF-7/LEC model within 4 hand the CF of the methanolic extract inhibited CCIDs almostsimilarly (with insignificant difference; Figure 1). Sub-fractionA of the CF was the most active one and other four fractions(B\u2013E) also exhibited significant CCID-inhibitory properties(Figure 2).Hispidulin turned out to be the major component in sub-fraction A, whereas koelzioside and scrovalentinoside, the maincomponents in sub-fractions C and D, respectively, showedsignificantly less activity. To evaluate the potential of hispidulinin suppressing CCID formation, the pure compound wastested as well-demonstrating an IC50 of 88.7 \u00b5M confirminga contribution of hispidulin to the effects of the methanolicextract. This further implicated that other components presentin sub-fraction A must have synergized strongly with hispidulinas only 250 \u00b5g/mL of sub-fraction A inhibited \u223c90% CCIDformation (compared to 26.6 mg/mL of purified hispidulin,which inhibited just 50%). Conceivably, residual amounts ofsub-fraction B still been present in sub-fraction A caused thissynergy. Hispidulin, in vitro and in vivo, had been shownto inhibit proliferation and to induce apoptosis of variouscancer lines (Yu et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2015; Wang et al.,2015). The compound exhibited cytotoxicity toward HepG2liver cancer cells but not normal liver cells (Gao et al., 2014).It also inhibited pancreas cancer cell mobility and invasionin vitro as well as neovascularization in C57/BL6 mice (Heet al., 2011). Additionally, colon cancer cell intravasation throughblood endothelial barriers was hindered in vitro (Holzner et al.,2017).CONCLUSIONIn the activity-guided search for components of S. lucidainhibitory in the CCID assay, we showed that intravasation ofbreast cancer cells through the lymph endothelial wall, which isthe major route of breast cancer dissemination, is significantlyinhibited by hispidulin and other compounds present in the CFof S. lucida methanolic extract.In addition, this is the first study characterizing the chemicalcomposition of S. lucida. It resulted in the proof or tentativeidentification of several rare iridoids and flavonoids for the firsttime in the genus Scrophularia and a new compound, 2\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin, was unambiguously elucidated.For a more profound assessment of the potential of S. lucidato inhibit metastasis in breast cancer, testing in an appropriateanimal model is necessary as a next step.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSVL, LS, and TL performed the phytochemical fractionationof the extract and isolation of secondary metabolites.

This is afavorable property for long term strategies for the attenuation of lymph node metastasis,which may effectively improve the prognostic states in breast cancer. Hence, westudied two flavonoids, apigenin and luteolin exhibiting strong bio-activity in varioustest systems in cancer research and are readily available on the market. This studyhas further advanced the mechanistic understanding of breast cancer intravasationthrough the lymphatic barrier. Apigenin and luteolin were tested in a three-dimensional(3-D) assay consisting of MDA-MB231 breast cancer spheroids and immortalizedlymph endothelial cell (LEC) monolayers. The 3-D model faithfully resembles theintravasation of breast cancer emboli through the lymphatic vasculature. Western blotanalysis, intracellular Ca2+ determination, EROD assay and siRNA transfection revealedinsights into mechanisms of intravasation as well as the anti-intravasative outcomeof flavonoid action. Both flavonoids suppressed pro-intravasative trigger factors inMDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, specifically MMP1 expression and CYP1A1 activity.A pro-intravasative contribution of FAK expression in LECs was established as FAKsupported the retraction of the LEC monolayer upon contact with cancer cells therebyenabling them to cross the endothelial barrier. As mechanistic basis, MMP1 caused thephosphorylation (activation) of FAK at Tyr397 in LECs. Apigenin and luteolin preventedMMP1-induced FAK activation, but not constitutive FAK phosphorylation. Luteolin,unlike apigenin, inhibited MMP1-induced Ca2+ release. Free intracellular Ca2+ is acentral signal amplifier triggering LEC retraction through activation of the mobility proteinMLC2, thereby enhancing intravasation. FAK activity and Ca2+ levels did not correlate.This implicates that the pro-intravasative contribution of FAK and of Ca2+ release inLECs was independent of each other and explains the better anti-intravasative effectsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 220242fphar-09-00220 March 12, 2018 Time: 13:3 # 2Hong et al. Inhibition of Intravasation by Flavonoidsof luteolin in vitro. In specific formulations, flavonoid concentrations causing significantanti-intravasative effects, can certainly be achieved in vivo. As the therapeutic strategyhas to be based on permanent flavonoid treatment both the beneficial and adverseeffects have to be investigated in future studies.Keywords: intravasation, 3D model, flavonoids, FAK, MMP1, CYP1A1, Ca2+ releaseINTRODUCTIONSpecies of the Scrophularia family are used in ethno-medicinesince ancient times (Galindez et al., 2002). In the search foranti-metastatic natural compounds, extracts of six Scrophulariaspecies were tested. For a methanolic extract from S. lucida asignificant anti-intravasative activity was discovered (Giessriglet al., 2012). The chloroform fraction of the methanolic extractinhibited in vitro intravasation of breast cancer spheroids mosteffectively. The major compound of the most active sub-fractionwas hispidulin which, as pure compound, attenuated this earlystage of the metastatic process significantly (Lewenhofer et al.,2018, same issue). Therefore, we decided to test two structurallyrelated flavonoids, luteolin and apigenin, in in-depth mechanisticstudies. These flavonoids are present in many medicinal plantsused in the traditional medicine of Central and Eastern Europe.One of the oldest references to a healing plant in occidentalliterature can be found in Homer\u2019s Iliad (book XI, line 822et seq.; Murray, 1924). There is said that \u2019A\u03c7\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u00b4\u03c2 used abitter, astringent root to treat wounds. This background inmythology led to the name of a very important medicinal plant:Achillea. In fact, this plant is used to treat, among other ailments,bleeding disorders and bruises (Akram, 2013). Later, Achillea sp.(\u201cAchilleios\u201d) was also listed in De Materia Medica; Dioscurides,1st century A.D. and used by Classical Greeks, in the RomanEmpire, the Byzantium, and the Middle Ages up until ourpresent day. A. millefolium is very rich in glycosides of luteolinand apigenin, which are easily metabolized into the respectivegenins (Benedek et al., 2007; Benetis et al., 2008). Many otherapigenin- and luteolin-rich plant genera are also listed in DeMateria Medica: Cynara, Apium, Allium, Petroselinum, Punica,Thymus, Solidago, Chamaemelum, Viola, and Vitis (the entire 5thbook is dedicated to Vitis).Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) comprises about 15%of all breast cancer types. In general, TNBC responds wellto chemotherapy as long it has not disseminated to otherorgans. However, as soon as TNBC metastasizes the success ofdrug treatment is very limited. This implicates that TNBC, inaddition to conventional therapy, needs a metastasis-preventiveapproach to maintain a tumor state associated with a betterprognosis. At an early stage of metastasis breast cancer cellsintravasate the lymphatic vasculature and colonize lymph nodes.Importantly, the \u201clymph node status\u201d is a prognostic breasttumor marker (Sobin et al., 2009). Hence, we hypothesizedthat compounds which prevent intravasation may interfere withtumor progression such as lymph node- and distant organmetastasis. As such a preventive concept for TNCB has to bebased on long term drug administration, the therapeutic regimenhas to be mild and rather free of side effects to allow continuoustreatment. Luteolin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosisof the highly metastatic TNBC cell line MDA-MB231 (Attoubet al., 2011). Anti-invasive/anti-metastatic activities of luteolin(Tsai et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017) and the structurally relatedanalog apigenin (Lindenmeyer et al., 2001; Qin et al., 2016;Zhao et al., 2017) have also been demonstrated in variouscancer cell lines. As these flavonoids are also wide-spreadconstituents in fruits and vegetables they are considered freeof adverse effects. This tempted us to investigate luteolinand apigenin in terms of their anti-intravasative properties.In the daily diet, the concentration of flavonoids is too lowto show tumor preventive effects (Vogiatzoglou et al., 2015).However, apigenin and luteolin are also commercially availableas food supplements with rather high concentrations (40\u2013200 mgapigenin/capsule; 50 mg luteolin/capsule) and may provide apreventive option.The TNCB cell line MDA-MB231 over-expresses thepro-metastatic matrix metalloprotease 1 (MMP1), and inhibitionof MMP1 attenuates tumor intravasation (Nguyen et al., 2015).Furthermore, MDA-MB231 cells secrete the pro-intravasativearachidonic acid metabolite 12(S)-HETE (Nguyen et al., 2016a),which is synthesized by CYP1A1. Therefore, we investigatedwhether luteolin and apigenin interfered with MMP1 expressionand CYP1A1 activity in MDA-MB231 cells.MMP1 and 12(S)-HETE activate the PAR1 and the12(S)-HETE receptor, respectively, in LECs, which both triggerthe release of Ca2+, causing the rapid retraction of LECs. Thisopens gaps in the monolayer [circular chemorepellent-induceddefects (CCIDs)] through which tumor cells cross the endothelialbarrier (Nguyen et al., 2015, 2016b). Hence, the influence ofapigenin and luteolin on levels of intracellular Ca2+ in LECswas investigated. The expression of FAK in LECs seems to becrucial for rapid cell movement (Desai et al., 2009) as observedduring CCID formation. Thus, FAK expression and activity werestudied as well.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and ReagentsPolyclonal rabbit anti-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) andpolyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-Tyr397-FAK were purchasedfrom Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, United States), polyclonalrabbit anti-MMP1 from Abcam (Cambridge, United Kingdom)and monoclonal anti-\u03b2-actin from Sigma (Munich, Germany).Polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse, anti-goat and anti-rabbit IgGswere acquired from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark).

Treatment ofthe three-dimensional MDA-MB231/LEC model with apigenin(Figure 1A) and luteolin (Figure 1B) dose dependently inhibitedCCID formation in the LEC monolayer, with luteolin showinga stronger effect than apigenin. Simultaneous treatment with20 \u00b5M luteolin and 20 \u00b5M apigenin synergized and inhibitedCCID formation significantly stronger than 40 \u00b5M luteolin or40 \u00b5M apigenin, respectively, thus suggesting that luteolin andapigenin interfered with distinct pro-intravasative mechanisms(Figure 1C).Apigenin/Luteolin Inhibit MMP1Expression and CYP1A1 Activity inMDA-MB231 CellsMDA-MB231 cell spheroids express MMP1, which is onemechanism causing CCIDs in the adjacent LEC monolayer(Nguyen et al., 2015). Thus, the expression of MMP1 wasinvestigated after treatment of MDA-MB231 cells with apigeninand luteolin. 20 \u00b5M apigenin and 20 \u00b5M luteolin causeda significant and time-dependent down-regulation of MMP1protein (Figures 2A,B).Another mechanism of breast cancer emboli to cross theendothelial barrier is the secretion of 12(S)-HETE which, inMDA-MB231 cells, is produced by CYP1A1 (Nguyen et al.,2016a). Hence, the activity of CYP1A1 in MDA-MB231 cellswas analyzed by EROD assay after treatment with increasingconcentrations of apigenin and luteolin. 5\u201320 \u00b5M apigeninand luteolin inhibited CYP1A1 activity significantly within 4 h(Figure 3).The results proved that apigenin and luteolin inhibited MMP1expression and CYP1A1 activity, which trigger the retraction ofthe adjacent LEC barrier thereby enabling MDA-MB231 tumorspheroid intravasation.Influence of Apigenin and Luteolin onIntracellular Ca2+ Release in LECThe intravasation of breast cancer cells relies on an interplaybetween cancer emboli and the LEC barrier (Vonach et al., 2011;Viola et al., 2013). Therefore, it was investigated whether apigeninFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 220246fphar-09-00220 March 12, 2018 Time: 13:3 # 6Hong et al. Inhibition of Intravasation by FlavonoidsFIGURE 5 | Analysis of drug combinations on CCID formation. MDA-MB231 spheroids were placed on LEC monolayers and treated with solvent (DMSO, Co), or(A,B) 20 \u00b5M apigenin, or (C,D) 20 \u00b5M luteolin, alone, or together with (A,C) 5 \u00b5M BAPTA-AM, or together with (B,D) 2.5 \u00b5M U73122 for 4 h, after which CCIDareas were measured using an Axiovert microscope and Zen little 2012 software. Three independent experiments with at least five replicates were analyzed. Errorbars indicate means \u00b1 SEM and asterisks and hash significances (\u2217p < 0.05; t-test).or luteolin would also inhibit the pro-intravasative response ofLECs.The release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores plays a centralrole in MMP1- and 12(S)-HETE-induced CCID formation(Nguyen et al., 2016b; Stadler et al., 2017). Hence, it was testedwhether apigenin and luteolin affected intracellular Ca2+ release.Luteolin prevented MMP1-induced Ca2+ increase (Figure 4A),which is consistent with previous reports (Jiang et al., 2005). Incontrast, apigenin did not reduce MMP1-induced Ca2+ levelsin LECs, but in contrast increased Ca2+ release (Figure 4B).This is in agreement with data that apigenin activates potassiumchannels leading to their hyper-polarization and causingthe release of Ca2+ (Erdogan et al., 2007). Accordingly,treating the MDA-MB231/LEC model with apigenin andBAPTA-AM (intracellular Ca2+ inhibitor) caused a significantlystronger inhibition of CCID formation than apigenin alone,or BAPTA-AM alone (Figure 5A). Ca2+ release is dependenton PLC\u03b2 activity and, therefore, also the co-treatment withapigenin and U73122 (PLC inhibitor) attenuated CCIDformation significantly stronger than the treatment withjust apigenin or U73122 (Figure 5B). Luteolin amelioratedthe CCID-inhibitory effect of BAPTA-AM (Figure 5C) orU73122 (Figure 5D) even more efficiently than apigenin.Overall, these data support the notion that an additionalintravasative mechanism, which was independent of Ca2+signaling, must have been inhibited by apigenin and luteolin aswell.Luteolin/Apigenin InhibitPhosphorylation of Tyr397-FAK in LECThe FAK controls cell-matrix interactions and mobility (Schwocket al., 2010) as observed in CCID formation (Nguyen et al.,2015).

The inhibitionof Tyr397-FAK phosphorylation by apigenin did not correlatewith the inhibition of Ca2+ release. Therefore, the relevanceof FAK for CCID formation was studied by siRNA-mediatedknock-down of FAK (siFAK). In fact, siFAK transfection of LECssuppressed MDA-MB231-induced CCID formation by \u223c50%(Figure 7A). The knock-down of FAK was confirmed by Westernblotting (Figure 7B). Hence, FAK significantly contributed tointravasation in vitro and apigenin and luteolin inhibited thismechanism.Earlier work demonstrated that CCID formation throughMLC2 depends on intracellular Ca2+ release (Nguyen et al.,2015). Our results show that FAK-dependent CCID formationdid not correlate with intracellular Ca2+ levels. Althoughboth pathways were induced by MMP1, they, obviously,are independent of each other. Thus, we hypothesized thatsimultaneous inhibition of MLC2 (Ca2+-dependent) andFAK (Ca2+-independent) by respective siRNAs, shouldbring about a greater reduction in CCID formation thaninhibition of either FAK or MLC2 alone, which wasactually confirmed (Figure 8). This supports former data(Figure 1C) showing that luteolin (inhibiting FAK andCa2+ release) and apigenin (inhibiting FAK but not Ca2+release) synergize in CCID attenuation via distinct signalingpathways.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 220248fphar-09-00220 March 12, 2018 Time: 13:3 # 8Hong et al.

Error bars indicate means \u00b1 SEM, asterisks and hash significances(p < 0.05; t-test).DISCUSSIONWe show for the first time that luteolin and apigenin attenuatethe intravasation of breast cancer cells in vitro. At the testedconcentrations, luteolin and apigenin inhibited CYP1A1 activityin MDA-MB231 cells. CYP1A1 synthesizes the pro-metastaticarachidonic acid metabolite 12(S)-HETE and is induced, e.g., bythe activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor, the expression of whichis high in many cancer entities (Murray et al., 2014) and alsoin MDA-MB231 cells (Nguyen et al., 2016a). In HepG2 cellswith a luciferase reporter fused to the CYP1A1-regulator region,5 \u00b5M apigenin increased reporter gene expression by threefold.In contrast, the higher concentration of 20 \u00b5M apigenininhibited the expression by 50% (Allen et al., 2001). In cell-freeassays luteolin inhibited CYP1A1 more potently than apigenin,whereas CYP1A2 was inhibited more efficiently by apigenin(Kim et al., 2005). CYP1A2 mediates the formation of flavonoidmetabolites with different properties to the genuin compounds.The comparability of flavonoid effects is rather difficult amongdifferent cell lines, which depend on the expression and activityprofiles of the various CYP isoforms converting these flavonoidsto other (more or less active) products (Androutsopoulos et al.,2009). Based on the very different individual expression levelsof CYP1A2 in humans, Breinholt et al. (2002) conclude that thismay result in different individual sensitivity.Apigenin and luteolin inhibited also MMP1 expression inMDA-MB231 cells. MMP1 expression is induced by NF-\u03baB(Lee et al., 2011), which is activated not only in inflamed- butalso in cancerous tissue (Karin and Greten, 2005; Karin, 2006).Recently, we provided evidence that specific inhibition ofNF-\u03baB (by siRELA, siNFKB1, siNEMO) down-regulated MMP1expression and attenuated CCID formation (Nguyen et al., 2015).Flavones such as apigenin and luteolin inhibited NF-\u03baB activityand consequently the expression of its target MMP9 (Amruthaet al., 2014). Hence, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB by apigenin andluteolin may have been the reason for suppressed MMP1 levelsin MDA-MB231 cells.As shown here, recombinant MMP1 significantly inducedthe phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 in LECs. FAK activitycontributes to cancer cell migration by establishing loosecell-matrix interactions necessary for rapid cell movement(Desai et al., 2009; Schwock et al., 2010), as described inCCID formation (Kerjaschki et al., 2011). In our experimentssuppression of FAK significantly inhibited CCID formation.The activation of FAK (through phosphorylation of Tyr397)is mediated through Kv2.1 channels (Wei et al., 2008). SinceFAK as well as potassium channel activity contribute to LECretraction and CCID formation (Nguyen et al., 2017), thereduction of Tyr397-FAK phosphorylation by apigenin mayhave been due to the inhibition of potassium channels. Thiswas supported by reports demonstrating that trimethyl-apigenininterfered with cardiac potassium currents (Liu et al., 2012) andthe inhibition of potassium channel activity by the flavonoidsacacetin, scutellarin, genistein, and naringenin (Teisseyre andMichalak, 2005; Zhu et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2011; Gasiorowskaet al., 2012). However, quite to the contrary, apigenin andluteolin exhibited vasodilatory effects, which are discussed tobe due to activation (rather than inactivation) of potassiumchannels (Calderone et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2005). A morerecent research concluded that the vasodilatory properties ofapigenin and luteolin were independent of potassium channelinhibition, but due to extracellular calcium influx (Robertset al., 2013). Therefore, the mechanism by which apigeninand luteolin inhibit FAK phosphorylation remains to beestablished.MMP1 also activates the mobility protein MLC2 in LECs,which contributes to CCID formation as well (Nguyen et al., 2015,2016c). MMP1 binds to PAR1, activates PLC\u03b2, triggers Ca2+release and activates the Ca2+-calmodulin kinase MYLK, whichphosphorylates MLC2. MMP1 was also shown to cause migrationby binding to PAR1 in breast cancer cells (Boire et al., 2005)and blood endothelial cells (Juncker-Jensen et al., 2013). WhereasMMP1-induced MLC2 activation depends on Ca2+ release,FAK activation was not found to correlate with intracellularCa2+ levels. This implicates that the pathway activating FAKrepresents a pro-intravasative mechanism independent of theone activating MLC2. Therefore, the inhibition both of FAK(either by siFAK or apigenin) and of MLC2 (by siMLC2, orBAPTA-AM, or U73122) reduced CCID formation in LECmonolayers to a greater extent than the inhibition of just onepathway.Summing up, luteolin and apigenin inhibitedpro-intravasative mechanisms in MDA-MB231 breast cancercells at the levels of CYP1A1 activity and MMP1 expression. InLECs, apigenin and luteolin inhibited MMP1-induced, aberrantFAK activity but not constitutive, normal FAK phosphorylation.Only luteolin inhibited Ca2+ signaling in LEC, which contributedFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 220249fphar-09-00220 March 12, 2018 Time: 13:3 # 9Hong et al. Inhibition of Intravasation by Flavonoidsto CCID formation (Nguyen et al., 2016b). This may explain whyluteolin affected CCID formation more potently than apigenin aswell as the synergism between apigenin and luteolin.The results implicate that luteolin and apigenin maintainedthe resilience of the endothelial barrier whilst attacking cancercells and additionally, inhibited the malignant armamentariumof the tumor. Luteolin and apigenin exerted their effects at low\u00b5M concentrations which usually cannot be reached by dailydietary intake (Vogiatzoglou et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the dailyintake of particular flavonoid subclasses (flavonols, flavan-3-ols,anthocyanidins) significantly correlates inversely with the riskof colorectal cancer (Woo and Kim, 2013). However, no otherflavonoid subclasses or total flavonoids are associated with alower risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal women (Huiet al., 2013). Intake of highly enriched apigenin and luteolinformulations achieved flavonoid concentrations in blood plasmawhich are comparable to those described herein in vitro. In detail,a single oral dose of apigenin delivered via a carbon nanopowdersolid dispersion carrier (60 mg/kg) to rats resulted in peak plasmaconcentrations of up to 3.2\u00b5g/mL which corresponds to 11.8\u00b5M(Ding et al., 2014). Similarly, a single oral dose luteolin in apeanut hull extract (14.3 mg/kg) to rats resulted in peak plasmaconcentrations of up to 8.3 \u00b5g/mL (29.1 \u00b5M) (Zhou et al., 2008).The evaluation as to whether these concentrations are free ofnegative side effects throughout long term treatment requirescontrolled phase I studies.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSJlH, AF, and DM performed the experiments.

The present study aimed toevaluate the chemical composition (polyphenols, iridoids, and phytosterols), antioxidant,antimicrobial and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of different extracts of A. laxmanniiaerial parts. The major identified bioactive compounds were rutin, 8-O-acetylharpagideand \u03b2-sitosterol. The antioxidant activity of A. laxmannii extracts was evaluated usingseveral methods, and the results showed good antiradical effects. Moreover, theantimicrobial evaluation showed a potent antifungal activity against C. albicans andP. funiculosum. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effect was determined by monitoringsome parameters involved in the inflammatory process. The results obtained showeddifferences between the analyzed extracts; and therefore the importance of choosingthe best solvent in order to extract the appropriate amount of bioactive compounds.A. laxmannii ethanol extract showed an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing totalleukocytes, PMN, phagocytosis, and oxidative stress. Compared to diclofenac, only the50 mg/mL A. laxmannii extract had better anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stresseffects, and this could justify the importance of a correlation between the activity andthe used concentration. These findings strongly suggest that A. laxmannii could beconsidered as a valuable source of bioactive compounds, which could be further valuedas anti-inflammatory agents in the composition of several herbal drugs.Keywords: Ajuga laxmannii, polyphenols, iridoids, sterols, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobialFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7252fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 2Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiINTRODUCTIONMedicinal plants have proven their value as sources of moleculeswith therapeutic potential, and still represent an importantpool for the identification of novel drug leads (Atanasov et al.,2015). Moreover, nowadays herbal medicines have receivedgreat scientific interest because they provide both importantbiomolecules which are used in the treatment of severaldiseases, as well as a broad spectrum of long-term use andsafety. Nevertheless, plant secondary metabolites are excellentcandidates for developing new phytopharmaceuticals withvarious biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial,and anti-inflammatory (Shahidi and Ambigaipalan, 2015; Liaoet al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).In many parts of the world such as Europe, Asia, Africa,South America, plants and/or plant compounds are used tocure or prevent different diseases, being in the same time partof the cultural inheritage of different nations or ethnicities.Still, herbal medicines were used and applied only based ontraditional knowledge and empirical observations of \u201cindigenoushealers,\u201d without elucidating the chemical composition of theused extracts or mechanistic knowledge of their pharmacologicalactivities and main bioactive compounds (Atanasov et al.,2015). Often, the empirical value of medicinal plants is seenas a proof of effectiveness and safety, and still many plantpreparations are traditionally used without having a certainscientific proof of their pharmacological effects or long-termsafety and efficacy.Phytochemicals are biomolecules that occur in herbal drugsor phytopharmaceuticals, and possess the ability to modulate oneor more metabolic processes or pathways in the human organismresulting in health benefits and promotion of well-being (Abuajahet al., 2014; Ferrante et al., 2017; Locatelli et al., 2017). Within thisframe, new studies on uninvestigated traditionally used medicinalplants or plant products provide remarkable interest for thedevelopment of novel herbal drugs or herbal formulations.The genus Ajuga part of the Lamiaceae family comprises 50species, and about 300 taxa (including subspecies and varieties),distributed in Asia, Africa, Australia, North America, and Europe(Riaz et al., 2007; Atay et al., 2016). Some Ajuga species are usedin folk medicine for the treatment of diabetes, inflammation,malaria, high blood pressure, pain, fever, and as antihelmintic(Cocquyt et al., 2011). Moreover, several studies have been carriedout on Ajuga species indicating pharmacological activities such asantimalarial (Njoroge and Bussmann, 2006; Cocquyt et al., 2011),hypoglycemic (El-Hilaly et al., 2006), anti-inflammatory (Gautamet al., 2011), anti-arthritis, antipyretic, anabolic, antibacterial,hepatoprotective, antifungal, antioxidant, cardiotonic (Israili andLyoussi, 2009), and analgesic properties (Ono et al., 2008).Additionally, several phytochemical studies on Ajuga specieshave shown the presence of iridoids, diterpenes, phytoecdy-steroids, flavonoids, sterol glycosides and phenylethanoidglycosides as the main secondary metabolites of the genus(Manguro et al., 2006, 2011; Ono et al., 2011; Atay et al., 2016).Ajuga laxmannii (Murray) Benth. is an erect rhizomatouspubescent herb that belongs to the genus Ajuga, growing in thegrasslands of Romania and other parts of Europe. In Romania,the local name for this species is \u201cnobleman\u2019s beard\u201d (Romanian \u2013\u201cbarba boierului\u201d or \u201cavra\u02d8measca\u02d8\u201d or \u201ccres\u00b8tineasca\u02d8\u201d), and it isused as a galactogogue and anti-inflammatory agent. To thebest of our knowledge, there is only one study on A. laxmannii(Murray) Benth. regarding its antiprotozoal activity (Atay et al.,2016).Within this frame, the aim of this study was to performa phytochemical analysis of A. laxmannii aerial parts extracts,particularly polyphenolic compounds, iridoids and phytosterols,and to investigate the antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicalsThe standards used were chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid,caffeic acid, rutin, apigenin, quercetin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside,kaempferol, quercetol, myricetol, fisetin, gallic acid, aucubin,catalpol, harpagoside, \u03b2-sitosterol, brassicasterol, stigmasterol,campesterol and ergosterol from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Germany),ferulic acid, sinapic acid, gentisic acid, patuletin, luteolin fromRoth (Germany), caftaric acid from Dalton (United States),harpagide, 8-O-acetyl-harpagide from PhytoLab GmbH & Co.(Germany).

Sodium carbonate, Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, sodium acetate trihydrate andanhydrous aluminum chloride were acquired from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Germany). The DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl),Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylicacid) were obtained from Alfa-Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany),HRP (horseradish peroxidase), Fremy\u2019s salt were purchased fromSigma\u2013Aldrich (Germany).Methanolic stock solutions (100 mg/mL) of the flavonoidstandards were prepared and stored at 4\u25e6C, protected fromdaylight. They were appropriately diluted with double distilledwater before being used as working solutions. Methanolic stocksolutions of iridoids (1 mg/mL) were prepared and stored at 4\u25e6C,protected from daylight. They were appropriately diluted withdouble distilled water before being used as working solutions.Chloroform stock solutions (1 mg/mL) of the phytosterolstandards were prepared and stored at 4\u25e6C, protected fromdaylight. Before being used as working solutions, they wereappropriately diluted with acetonitrile. Distilled, deionised waterwas produced by a Direct Q-5 Millipore (Millipore SA, Molsheim,France) water system.Plant Sample and Extraction ProcedureAjuga laxmannii aerial parts were collected from Cluj County(Romania) spontaneous flora during flowering stage in June2015. The air-dried powder of herbal material was extracted withdifferent solvents. The methanol extract was obtained from 5 gFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7253fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 3Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiherbal material and 50 mL 70% methanol for 30 min on a waterbath at 60\u25e6C (Methanol Extract, ME). The 10% tincture wasprepared at room temperature from 100 g of herbal materialand 1000 mL 70% ethanol by maceration at room temperaturefor 7 days (Ethanol Extract, EE) as previously described byToiu et al. (2017). In order to evaluate the anti-inflammatoryactivity of A. laxmannii aerial parts, three extracts were used:A. laxmannii ethanol extract 100% (100 mg dry weight herbalmaterial/mL), A. laxmannii ethanol extract 50% (50 mg dw herbalmaterial/mL), and A. laxmannii ethanol extract 25% (25 mg dwherbal material/mL).For identification and quantification of phytosterols, and fordetermination of antifungal properties, chloroform (CE) andpetroleum ether extracts (PEE) were also prepared. Thus, 2.5 g ofherbal material were extracted with 25 mL chloroform and 25 mLpetroleum ether, respectively, for 30 min in a sonication bath at60\u25e6C. The extracts were cooled down, and then centrifuged at4500 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was recovered (Mocanet al., 2014).Quantitative Determinations of TotalBioactive CompoundsTotal Phenolic Content (TPC)The total phenolic content (TPC) of the A. laxmannii extractswas determined photometrically, by Folin-Cioc\u00e2lteu method withslight modifications (Ta\u02d8mas\u00b8 et al., 2009). Briefly, 2 mL of eachethanolic and methanolic extracts were diluted 25 times, thenmixed with Folin-Cioc\u00e2lteu reagent (1 mL) and distilled water(10.0 mL), and further diluted to 25 mL with a 290 g/L solutionof sodium carbonate. The samples were incubated in the darkfor 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 760 nm, usinga JASCO V-530 (Jasco International Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)UV-VIS spectrophotometer. TPC values were expressed as gallicacid equivalents (R2 = 0.999), mg gallic acid/g dry weight herbalmaterial (mg GAE/g dw herbal material). Assay was performedin triplicate.Total Flavonoid Content (TFC)The total flavonoid content (TFC) of the A. laxmannii extractswas calculated and expressed as rutin equivalents after themethod previously described (Mocan et al., 2014). Briefly, eachextract (EE and ME) (5 mL) was mixed with sodium acetate(5.0 mL, 100 g/L), aluminum chloride (3.0 mL, 25 g/L), andmixed up to 25 mL in a calibrated flask with methanol. Theabsorbance was measured at 430 nm. The TFC was expressedas rutin equivalents (R2 = 0.999), mg rutin equivalents/g dryweight herbal material (mg RE/g dw herbal material). Assay wasperformed in triplicate.Total Iridoid Content (TIC)The total iridoid content (TIC) of the A. laxmannii extractswas determined by a photometric method based on a Trim-Hillreaction and the results were expressed as aucubin equivalents(mg AE/g dw herbal material). Each extract (0.4 mL) wasmixed with 4 mL of Trim-Hill reagent (acetic acid \u20130.2%CuSO4 - conc. HCl, 10:1:0.5), afterwards the absorbance wasmeasured at 609 nm, and the blue color indicated the presence ofiridoids. The amount of iridoids was calculated using an aucubin(0.1\u20131 mg/mL) calibration curve (R2 = 0.999) (Erdenechimeget al., 2017). Assay was performed in triplicate.Antioxidant Capacity AssaysFor testing the antioxidant capacity, the A. laxmannii extractswere further tested using three different assays.DPPH Radical Scavenging ActivityThe effect of the A. laxmannii extracts against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was tested accordingto Savran et al. (2016). Two milliliters of sample solution(2 mL, 3.75\u201330 \u00b5g/mL) was added to 2 mL of a 0.1 mg/mLDPPH methanol solution. After 30 min of incubation at roomtemperature in the dark, the absorbance was read at 517 nm.The DPPH radical scavenging activity was expressed as IC50(\u00b5g/mL). The percentage of DPPH consumption was convertedto trolox equivalents (TE) using a calibration curve (R2 = 0.985)of Trolox standard solutions (0.5\u20135 \u00b5g/mL). Considering theresults, an IC50 < 50 \u00b5g TE/mL shows a very good antioxidantpotential; an IC50 of 50\u2013100 \u00b5g TE/mL displays a goodantioxidant potential; an IC50 of 100\u2013200 \u00b5g TE/mL reveals aweak antioxidant potential; an IC50 > 200 \u00b5g TE/mL means noantioxidant potential (Araniciu et al., 2014). Assay was performedin triplicate.ABTS Radical Cation Scavenging ActivityThe scavenging activity of the A. laxmannii ethanol extractagainst the ABTS radical cation (2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline)-6-sulphonic acid) was measured according toZengin et al. (2014). ABTSr+ was produced directly by reacting7 mM ABTS solution with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate andallowing the mixture to stand for 12\u201316 h in the dark at roomtemperature. Prior to beginning the assay, ABTS solution wasdiluted with methanol to an absorbance of 0.700 \u00b1 0.02 at734 nm. Sample solution was added to ABTS solution (2 mL)and mixed. After 30 min incubation at room temperature,the sample absorbance was read at 734 nm. The ABTS radicalcation scavenging activity was expressed as milligrams ofTE per gram of extract (mg TE/g). Assay was performed intriplicate.Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)SpectroscopyIn order to compare with the results of the spectrophotometricmeasurements, the radical scavenging activity of the A. laxmanniiethanol extract was additionally measured with EPRspectrometry using the stable synthetic radical Fremy\u2019s saltas reported previously (Barakat and Rohn, 2014; Moussa-Ayoub et al., 2014). A mixture of 25 mL of the diluted extractand a 25 mL of a 1 mM Fremy\u2019s salt solution [potassiumnitrosodisulfonate, K2NO(SO3)2] in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)were filled into a 50 mL capillary. After a reaction time of30 min, the EPR spectrum of Fremy\u2019s salt radical was recordedand intensity was obtained by integration of the signal. Theantioxidant activity of the extract, expressed as milligramsof Fremy\u2019s salt equivalents per gram dry weight (mg FSE/gFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7254fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 4Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniidw), was calculated in comparison to a control reaction withthe solvent. Spectra were recorded at 21\u25e6C on a MiniscopeMS 200 X-band spectrometer (Magnettech GmbH, Berlin,Germany) with the microwave power set to 10 dB and usingmodulation amplitude of 1500 mG. Assay was performed intriplicate.Identification and Quantification ofPolyphenolic CompoundsGeneral Apparatus and Chromatographic ConditionsAn Agilent 1100 HPLC Series system was used (AgilentTechnologies, Darmstadt, Germany), coupled with an AgilentIon Trap SL mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray orAPCI ion source.Chromatographic Conditions for the Analysis ofPolyphenolic CompoundsThe experiment was carried out using an Agilent 1100 HPLCSeries system (Agilent, United States) equipped with degasser,binary gradient pump, column thermostat, autosampler andUV detector. The HPLC system was coupled with an Agilent1100 mass spectrometer (LC/MSD Ion Trap VL). For theseparation, a reverse-phase analytical column was employed(Zorbax SB-C18 100 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm i.d., 3.5 \u00b5m particle); thework temperature was 48\u25e6C. The detection of the compoundswas performed on both UV and MS mode. The UV detectorwas set at 330 nm until 17.5 min, then at 370 nm. TheMS system operated using an electrospray ion source innegative mode. The chromatographic data were processedusing ChemStation and Data Analysis software from Agilent,United States.The mobile phase was a binary gradient prepared frommethanol and solution of 0.1% acetic acid (v/v). The elutionstarted with a linear gradient, beginning with 5% methanol andending at 42% methanol, for 35 min; isocratic elution followed forthe next 3 min with 42% methanol. The flow rate was 1 mL/minand the injection volume was 5 \u00b5L.The MS signal was used only for qualitative analysisbased on specific mass spectra of each compound. The MSspectra obtained from a standard solution of polyphenolswere integrated in a mass spectra library. Later, the MStraces/spectra of the compounds from analyzed samples werecompared to spectra from library, which allows positiveidentification of each substance, based on spectral match.The UV trace was used for quantification of identifiedcompounds from MS detection. Using the chromatographicconditions described above, the polyphenols eluted in less than35 min. Four polyphenols cannot be quantified in currentchromatographic conditions due overlapping (caftaric acidwith gentisic acid and caffeic acid with chlorogenic acid).However, all four compounds can be selectively identified inMS detection (qualitative analysis) based on differences betweentheir molecular mass and MS spectra. The detection limits werecalculated as minimal concentration producing a reproductivepeak with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than three. Quantitativedeterminations were performed using an external standardmethod. Calibration curves in the range of 0.5\u201350 \u00b5g/mL rangewith good linearity (R2 > 0.999) for a five point plot wereused to determine the concentration of polyphenols in plantsamples.Mass Spectrometry AnalysesThe detection and quantification of polyphenols was madein UV assisted by mass spectrometry. Due peak overlapping,four polyphenol-carboxylic acids (caftaric, gentisic, caffeic, andchlorogenic) were determined only based on MS spectra, whereasfor the rest of compounds the linearity of calibration curves wasvery good (R2 > 0.998), with detection limits in the range of 18to 92 ng/mL. The detection limits were calculated as minimalconcentration producing a reproductive peak with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than three. Quantitative determinationswere performed using an external standard method; retentiontimes were determined with a standard deviation ranging from0.04 to 0.19 min. Accuracy was checked by spiking sampleswith a solution containing each polyphenol in a concentrationof 10 \u00b5g/mL. In all analyzed samples, the compounds wereidentified by comparison of their retention times and therecorded electrospray mass spectra with those of standardsin the same chromatographic conditions (Vlase et al., 2013;Andriamadio et al., 2015).Identification and Quantification ofPhytosterolsChromatographic Conditions for the Analysis ofPhytosterolsCompounds were separated using a Zorbax SB-C18 reversed-phase analytical column (100 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm i.d., 5 \u00b5m particle)fitted with a guard column Zorbax SB-C18, both operatedat 40\u25e6C. Sterols were separated under isocratic conditionsusing a mobile phase consisting of 10:90 (v/v) methanol andacetonitrile. The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the injection volumewas 5 \u00b5L. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on anAgilent Ion Trap 1100 VL mass spectrometer with atmosphericpressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface. The instrumentwas operated in positive ion mode. Operating conditions wereoptimized in order to achieve maximum sensitivity values: gastemperature (nitrogen) 325\u25e6C at a flow rate of 7 L/min, nebulizerpressure 60 psi and capillary voltage\u22124000 V.The identification of sterols was performed by comparingthe retention times and mass spectra with those of standardsin the same chromatographic conditions. To avoid or limit theinterference from background, the multiple reactions monitoringanalysis mode was used instead of single ion monitoring(e.g., MS/MS instead of MS). Linearity of calibration curveswas very good (R2 > 0.998), with detection limits in therange of 69 to 3312 ng/mL for ergosterol, 62 to 2952 ng/mLfor brassicasterol, 59 to 2808 ng/mL for campesterol, 136 to6528 ng/mL for stigmasterol, and 132 to 6336 ng/mL for\u03b2-sitosterol. The results are expressed as \u00b5g per mL of extract(\u00b5g/mL).The software ChemStation (vA09.03) and DataAnalysis (v5.3)from Agilent, United States were used for the acquisition andanalysis of chromatographic data (Vlase et al., 2013).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7255fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 5Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiIdentification and Quantification ofIridoidsTargeted A. laxmannii iridoids (aucubin, catalpol, harpagide,harpagoside, and 8-O-acetylharpagide) were analyzed by HPLC-MS on a Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system equippedwith a binary pump, autosampler, thermostat and detector (all1100 Series from Agilent Inc., United States). The system wascontrolled with Data Analysis software (version B01.03, AgilentInc., United States). The separation was carried out on anAtlantis HILIC 3.5 \u00b5m (100 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm i.d.) (Waters Inc.,United States) column equipped with an online 0.2 \u00b5m filter(Agilent Inc.), at a working temperature of 40\u25e6C, a flow rate of0.75 mL/min and an injection volume of 8 \u00b5L. A binary gradientsystem with eluent (A) 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) and 20 \u00b5M sodiumacetate in water, and eluent (B) 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) and 20 \u00b5Msodium acetate in acetonitrile was used for the analyzed sampleswith the following gradient: 95\u201380% B (0\u20135 min). The HPLCsystem was coupled with an Agilent Ion Trap 1100 SL massspectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionisation (ESI)source and operated in the positive mode with a scan rangebetween 360 and 680 m/z. The newly developed LC-ESI-MS/MSmethod was used to identify the targeted compounds based ontheir sodium adducts (M+23 m/z): aucubin (369 m/z), catalpol(385 m/z), harpagide (387.2 m/z), harpagoside (517.4 m/z)and 8-O-acetylharpagide (429.3 m/z), and by comparison withstandards in the same chromatographic conditions. The capillaryvoltage was set to 4 kV and the capillary temperature to 300\u25e6C.Nitrogen (N2) was used as dry gas with a dry flow of 12 L/minand a pressure of 60 psi for the nebulizer. For quantification ofthe iridoids, stock solutions of the five commercially availablestandards substances were prepared in acetonitrile, and differentconcentrations of each standard were used. All calibration curvesyielded a coefficient of determination of R2 \u2265 0.990. The resultsare expressed as\u00b5g per mL of extract (\u00b5g/mL). All phytochemicalassays were performed in triplicate.Antibacterial ActivityMicroorganisms and Culture ConditionsFor the bioassay, five aerobic bacterial strains were used,two Gram positive: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 49444),Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19114) and three gramnegative: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Salmonellatyphimurium (ATCC 14028) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922).All of the tested microorganisms were obtained from FoodBiotechnology Laboratory, Life Sciences Institute, Universityof Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj Napoca,Romania. The bacteria were cultured on Muller-Hinton Agarand cultures were stored at 4\u25e6C and subcultured once a month.Microdilution MethodThe modified microdilution technique was used to evaluateantimicrobial activity. Bacterial species were cultured overnightat 37\u25e6C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) medium at 37\u25e6C. Thebacterial cell suspensions were adjusted with sterile saline to aconcentration of approximately 2.5 \u00d7 105 CFU/mL in a finalvolume of 100 \u00b5L per well. The inoculum was stored at +4\u25e6Cfor further use. Dilutions of the inoculum were cultured on solidMuller\u2013Hinton (MH) for bacteria in order to verify the absenceof contamination and to check the validity of the inoculum.Determinations of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)were performed by a serial dilution technique using 96-wellmicrotitre plates. Different A. laxmannii ethanol extract dilutionswere carried out over the wells containing 100 \u00b5L of TSB andafterwards, 10 \u00b5L of inoculum was added to all the wells. Themicroplates were incubated for 24\u201348 h at 37\u25e6C. The MICof the samples was detected following the addition of 20 \u00b5L(0.2 mg/mL) of resazurin solution to each well, and the plateswere incubated 2 h at 37\u25e6C. A change from blue to pink indicatesreduction of resazurin, therefore, the bacterial growth. The MICwas defined as the lowest drug concentration that preventedthis color change. The minimum bactericidal concentrations(MBCs) were determined by serial subcultivation of a 2 \u00b5Linto microtitre plates containing 100 \u00b5L of broth per well andfurther incubation for 48 h at 37\u25e6C. The lowest concentration,with no visible growth, was defined as MBC, indicating 99.5%killing of the original inoculum. Gentamycin (25 \u00b5L/well atconcentration of 4 \u00b5g/mL) was used as positive control forbacterial growth. A 50% solution of ethanol in water was used asnegative control. All determinations were performed in triplicate,and values are the averages of three replicates (Mocan et al.,2014).Antifungal ActivityTo investigate the antifungal activities of A. laxmannii extracts,the following fungi were used: Aspergillus flavus (ATCC 9643),Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231),Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and Penicillium funiculosum(ATCC 56755). These fungi were obtained from the FoodBiotechnology Laboratory, Life Sciences Institute, University ofAgricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca,Romania. Cultures were maintained on malt agar at 4\u25e6Cand subcultured every month. Spore suspension (1.0 \u00d7 105CFU/mL) was obtained by washing agar plates with sterilesolution containing [0.85% saline, 0.10% Tween 80 (v/v)], thenadded to each well to a final volume of 100 \u00b5L. Inocula werescreened for contamination by culturing on a solid medium.The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum fungicidal (MFC)concentrations assays were determined using the microdilutionmethod by preparing a serial of dilutions in 96-well microtiterplates. The extracts (EE, PEE, CE) were diluted in 0.85% saline(10 mg/mL), then added to microplates containing Broth Maltmedium with inoculum and incubated for 72 h at 28\u25e6C on arotary shaker. The lowest concentrations without visible growth(at the binocular microscope) were defined as MICs. The MFCswere determined by serial sub-cultivation of 2 \u00b5L of testedextracts dissolved in medium and inoculated for 72 h, intomicrotiter plates containing 100 \u00b5L of broth per well and furtherincubation 72 h at 28\u25e6C. The lowest concentration with novisible growth was defined as MFC indicating 99.5% killingof the original inoculum. The fungicide fluconazole was usedas positive control (1\u20133500 \u00b5g/mL). All the experiments wereperformed in duplicate and repeated three times (Stana et al.,2017).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7256fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 6Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiIn Vivo Anti-inflammatory EffectsExperimental DesignAll procedures that involved the use of life animals followed theEuropean guidelines and rules as established by the EU Directive2010/63/EU. The study protocol was approved by the ResearchEthics Committee of the Iuliu Hat\u00b8ieganu University of Medicineand Pharmacy Cluj-Napoca (No. 382/2017).The experiments were performed on adult male Wistar (strainCrl:WI) albino rats (Charles River Laboratories, United States),weighing 200\u2013250 g, that were bred in the Animal Facility of IuliuHat\u00b8ieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy. The animalswere randomly assigned to six groups (n = 8). Rats from groupI were injected intramuscularly (i.m.) with 0.9% saline solutionas a negative control. Inflammation was induced by i.m. injectionof turpentine oil (6 mL/kg BW) in groups II\u2013VI. Animals werehoused under controlled conditions (12 h light/dark cycle, atan average temperature of 21\u201322\u25e6C and humidity of 50\u201355%),and had free access to standard pellet (Cantacuzino Institute,Bucharest, Romania) basal diet and water ad libitum. After thei.m. injection, the animals received the following intraperitoneal(i.p.) injections: groups I and II received 1 mL of a 0.9% salinesolution; groups III\u2013V received 5 mL/kg BW of A. laxmanniiethanol extract diluted in distilled water to concentrationsof 25% (25 mg dw/mL), 50% (50 mg dw/mL) and 100%(100 mg dw/mL), respectively; group VI received 20 mg/kg BWdiclofenac (Araniciu et al., 2014).In previous studies on anti-inflammatory activity ofA. bracteosa, the evaluated dose was 200 mg/kg BW (Kayaniet al., 2016), therefore in this research the animals received400 mg/kg BW (100%), 200 mg/kg BW (50%), and 100 mg/kgBW (25%) of A. laxmannii ethanol extract.Twenty-four hours after the incubation of inflammation, therats were anesthetized using a combination of 50 mg/kg BWketamine and 20 mg/kg BW xylazine (Parvu et al., 2014), andblood was withdrawn by retro-orbital puncture. Blood collectedfor use in the phagocytosis test and for white blood cellscount (WBC) was collected on ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA), while blood collected for use in the nitro-oxidative stresstests was collected without anticoagulant. Coagulated blood wascentrifuged and the separated serum was stored in \u221280\u25e6C untiluse. The total nitrites and nitrates (NOx), total oxidative status(TOS), total antioxidant response (TAR) and oxidative stressindex (OSI) calculation was measured in the serum.The experiments were performed in triplicate. At the endof the experiments under anesthesia using a combinationof ketamine (60 mg/kg BW) and xylazine (15 mg/kg BW)(Francischi et al., 2017) animals were killed by cervicaldislocation.In Vitro Phagocytosis TestPhagocytic activity (PA) was determined as previously describedwith minor modifications (Moldovan et al., 2011). The bloodsamples that were harvested on EDTA were incubated with anE. coli suspension (4 \u00d7 106 bacteria/mL, in 0.9% saline solutionin the ratio of 0.2 mL of blood/20 \u00b5L E. coli suspension) in asilicon tube at 37\u25e6C for 30 min. May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa stainedsmears were then prepared and counted by light microscopyusing an Olympus microscope. We used two parameters toassess phagocytic capacity: the PA which was the number of theE. coli bacteria that were phagocytized by 100 leukocytes, and thephagocytic index (PI) which was the percentage of leukocytes thatphagocytized at least one bacterium.WBC CountFor the WBC count, a blood sample dilution 1:10 in T\u00fcrksolution was prepared in a Potain leukocyte-dropper. The countwas performed with an optical microscope (Olympus), usinga B\u00fcrcker-T\u00fcrk counting chamber. The differential leukocytecount was expressed as a percentage and carried out on May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa stained smears.Oxidative Stress EvaluationFirst serum samples were passed through 10-kDd filters(Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany) and contaminant proteinswere removed by extraction with a 3:1 (v:v) solution ofmethanol/diethyl ether. The sample methanol/diethyl ether ratiowas 1:9 (v:v) (Harma et al., 2003). The Griess reaction was usedto indirectly determine NO synthesis (NOx). In brief, 100 \u00b5L of8 mg/mL VCl3 was added to 100 \u00b5L of filtered and extractedserum supernatant in order to reduce nitrate to nitrite, followedby the addition of the Griess reagents, 50 \u00b5L of SULF (2%)and 50 \u00b5L of NEDD (0.1%). After 30 min incubation at 37\u25e6C,the sample absorbance was read at 540 nm. The concentrationof serum NOx was determined using a sodium nitrite-basedcurve, and expressed as nitrite \u00b5mol/L (Miranda et al., 2001).The TOS of the serum was measured using a colorimetric assay(Erel, 2005). This assay measures the oxidation of ferrous ionsto ferric ions in the presence of various reactive oxygen speciesin an acidic medium. The ferric ions are detected by reactionwith xylenol orange. Assay measurements were standardizedusing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidative species, andthe obtained results were expressed in \u00b5mol H2O2 equivalents/L.The TAR was measured in serum using a colorimetric assay (Erel,2004). In this assay, the rate of hydroxyl radical producion bythe Fenton reaction was monitored by following the changesin the absorbance of colored dianisidyl radicals. Upon additionof a serum sample, the hydroxyl radical initiated oxidativereactions are suppressed by antioxidant present in the serum.Inhibition of dianisidyl oxidation prevents the subsequent colorchange, thereby effectively measuring the total antioxidantcapacity of the serum. This assay is calibrated using troloxand results are expressed as micromol TE/L. The ratio ofthe TOS to the TAR represents the OSI, an indicator of thedegree of oxidative stress (Harma et al., 2003): OSI (ArbitraryUnit) = TOS (micromol H2O2 equivalents/L)/TAR (micromolTE/L).All of the spectroscopic measurements were performed using aJasco V-530 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Jasco International Co.,Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).Statistical AnalysisAll results were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. Otherwise,the median and first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3)were reported. Statistical comparisons between two independentFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7257fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 7Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniigroups were performed using the Student\u2019s t-test (with equal andunequal variances, depending upon to the results of the F-test)for normally distributed data. Mann\u2013Whitney\u2019s test was usedfor non-parametric data. Pearson and Spearman\u2019s correlationanalyses were used to calculate statistical relationships betweenparameters. A p-value < 0.05 was considered as statisticallysignificant. Analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 forWindows (SPSS Inc., United States).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONQuantitative Determinations of TotalBioactive CompoundsVarious studies showed that phenolic compounds are widelydistributed in the Ajuga species and these compounds couldcontribute to their antioxidant activity. In this part, a preliminarycomparative overview of the total phenolic, flavonoid and iridoidcontents of the different extracts of the A. laxmannii is presented.The TPC is presented in Table 1 and was 67.68 \u00b1 1.57 mgGAE/g dw for ethanol extract, and 56.76 \u00b1 0.92 mg GAE/g dwfor methanol extract. The TPC values of analyzed A. laxmanniiaerial parts extracts were higher than those obtained previouslyfor A. reptans flower extracts (20.86 \u00b1 0.53 and 24.11 \u00b1 0.57 mgGAE/g dw, for methanol and ethanol extracts, respectively) byToiu et al. (2017). Another study performed by Movahhedinet al. (2016) revealed that ethanol extract of Ajuga chamaecistussubsp. scoparia (Boiss.) Rech.f. aerial parts (6.5 g extract obtainedfrom 50 g plant material) had a TPC value of 20.32 \u00b1 0.39 mgGAE/g extract (representing 2.64 mg GAE/g dw), and thewater extract had TPC values of 18.94 \u00b1 0.13 mg GAEs/gextract, which is lower than both previously considered Ajugaspecies.The TFC for ethanol extract of A. laxmannii (36.14\u00b1 0.53 mgRE/g dw), was lower than the one reported for the ethyl acetate,methanol and acetone extract of A. chamaepitys (L.) Schreb(91.76 \u00b1 0.81, 63.87 \u00b1 0.66, and 61.77 \u00b1 0.51 mg RE/g,respectively), and considerably higher than the water extract fromsame species (9.32\u00b1 0.33 mg RE/g) (Jakovljevic\u00b4, 2015). However,a clear comparison between the results of the present study israther impossible, due to different extraction protocols and waysof expressing results.In previous studies, Toiu et al. (2017) found a TFC value of12.38 \u00b1 0.22 mg RE/g dw for a methanol extract of A. reptansflowers.Concerning the TIC of different species of Ajuga, the availabledata is limited. In a former research on A. reptans flowers, ToiuTABLE 1 | TPC, TFC and TIC in A. laxmannii extracts (\u00b1SD).Extract TPC(mg GAE/g dw)TFC(mg RE/g dw)TIC(mg AE/g dw)Methanol extract (ME) 56.76 \u00b1 0.92 31.22 \u00b1 0.39 15.37 \u00b1 0.77Ethanol extract (EE) 67.68 \u00b1 1.57 36.14 \u00b1 0.53 16.28 \u00b1 0.85Values are the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).et al. (2017) revealed that the methanol extract content in iridoidsis lower than ethanol extract from the same species (22.17\u00b1 0.89vs. 27.49 \u00b1 0.94 mg AE/g dw). The same trend was observedin this study for the A. laxmannii, the TIC being 15.37 \u00b1 0.77and 16.28 \u00b1 0.85 mg AE/g dw for methanol and ethanol extract,respectively.Identification and Quantification ofPolyphenolic CompoundsIn order to determine the polyphenolic compounds fromA. laxmannii extracts, an optimized HPLC/MS method forthe identification and quantification of 18 polyphenols wasemployed. The A. laxmannii extracts contain one caffeic acidderivative (chlorogenic acid), corresponding to peak 1, withm/z 353, three flavonoid glycosides (isoquercitrin, rutin, andquercitrin), corresponding to peaks 2, 3, and 4, with m/z 463, 609,and 447, respectively. Additionally, two free aglycones (luteolinand apigenin), with m/z 285 and 279, corresponding to peaks 5and 6 were identified.The HPLC chromatogram of A. laxmannii ethanol extract(Figure 1), and the amounts of polyphenols identified in theanalyzed extracts expressed as \u00b5g/g dw are presented (Table 2).Rutin, an important flavonoid glycoside, was the majorcompound found in a significant quantity, both in ethanol andmethanol extract (6883.48 \u00b1 9.12 and 6721.49 \u00b1 8.92 \u00b5g/gdw, respectively). Various studies showed the effectivenessof rutin in various diseases such as inflammatory boweldisease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Kim et al., 2005; Xuet al., 2014). Another flavonoid glycoside compoundwhich was found and quantified in ethanol and methanolA. laxmannii extracts was isoquercitrin, which is known tohave good anti-inflammatory effects (Rogerio et al., 2007).The quantities obtained are significant lower than thoseobtained for rutin, but still important (685.35 \u00b1 5.72 and636.1 \u00b1 5.44 \u00b5g/g dw), for ethanol and methanol extracts,respectively.Considering the correlation between the type of the extractand the quantity of a particular compound, with one exception,all extracts showed similar values. Only in case of luteolin, themethanol extract showed a lower value than the ethanol extract(88.24\u00b1 1.09 vs. 122.27\u00b1 1.14 \u00b5g/g dw).Identification and Quantification ofPhytosterolsUnder the proposed chromatographic conditions, retentiontimes of the five analyzed sterols were: 3.2 min for ergosterol,3.9 min for brassicasterol, 4.9 min for stigmasterol andcampesterol (co-elution) and 5.7 min for \u03b2-sitosterol. The ionsmonitorized in the MS method are presented in Table 3. Inthe ionization conditions all sterols have lost a water molecule,therefore the ions detected by the mass spectrometer are alwaysin the form [M-H2O+H]+.The pseudo-molecular ions of sterols (379 for ergosterol,381 for brassicasterol, 395 for stigmasterol, 383 for campesterol,and 397 for \u03b2-sitosterol) have been fragmented, and basedon their daughter ions from the MS spectrum the extractedFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7258fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 8Toiu et al.

Values are the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).chromatograms of each compound were constructed. Themethod can also be applied for quantitative determinationbecause the intensity of ions in the mass spectrum is proportionalto the concentration of the substance in the sample.In order to quantify the five sterols from A. laxmannii extracts(EE, PEE, CE), we have constructed the extracted chromatogramsfor each compound, taking into account the intensity of majorions in the mass spectrum (Table 3).Calibration curves were obtained from standard solutions atdifferent concentration levels, selected as representative of therange of concentration in the sample. Regression analysis ofvarious concentrations of standard solutions (0.08\u20138 \u00b5g/mL)gave good correlation coefficients for the calibration curvesof sterols. Concentrations of phytosterols in A. laxmanniiextracts are presented in Table 4. Significant differencesbetween the three A. laxmannii extracts were observed: allfive sterols were identified in CE, whereas the EE contains\u03b2-sitosterol, stigmasterol, ergosterol and brassicasterol and PEEcontains campesterol, stigmasterol, ergosterol and brassicasterol.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7259fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 9Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiThe A. laxmannii CE was the richest in phytosterols, with\u03b2-sitosterol as major compound in very high concentration(11589.96 \u00b1 8.66 \u00b5g/mL), while in EE it was found in smallerquantities (367.24 \u00b1 2.97 \u00b5g/mL), and in PEE campesterol wasthe main sterol (598.04 \u00b1 4.22 \u00b5g/mL). The concentrations ofstigmasterol, ergosterol, and brassicasterol were comparable in allthree extracts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reporton phytosterols from A. laxmannii aerial parts extracts. Previousstudies showed the presence of stigmasterol and \u03b2-sitosterol inother Ajuga species, such as A. bracteosa, A. relicta, A. taiwanensis(Israili and Lyoussi, 2009).Identification and Quantification ofIridoidsIridoids are important compounds for the genus Ajuga, andmany Ajuga species contain the iridoid glycoside harpagide(Manguro et al., 2011; Mamadalieva et al., 2013). The mainknown ethnopharmacological indications for Ajuga species areoedema, hypertension, fever, intestinal and biliary disorders,ulcer, they are used as antipyretic, diuretic, and astringent(Toiu et al., 2017), and several studies have shown that iridoidglycosides in Ajuga species are linked to this therapeutic effects(Makni et al., 2013; Hailu and Engidawork, 2014). The HPLC-MSresults from the present study show the characterization of Ajugalaxmannii aerial parts in five commercially available iridoidglycosides, namely aucubin, catalpol, harpagide, harpagoside,and 8-O-acetylharpagide. From a pharmaceutical point ofview, the concentrations of the compounds determined inplant extract cannot be neglected as they are directly linkedto their pharmaceutical efficacy and effectiveness. 8-O-acetylharpagide was the major compound found in ethanolextract (266.3 \u00b1 3.92 \u00b5g/mL extract), followed by harpagide(87.4 \u00b1 2.39 \u00b5g/mL extract). The concentrations of aucubinand catalpol (7.2 \u00b1 0.41 and 3.1 \u00b1 0.23 \u00b5g/mL ethanol extract,respectively) were significantly lower than the other iridoids.We observed that A. laxmannii aerial parts ethanol extractcontains higher amounts of iridoids than methanol extract(Table 5). As far as one can tell, this is the first report of arapid, simple and highly accurate HPLC-MS/MS method for theidentification and quantification of iridoids from A. laxmanniiextracts.Antioxidant ActivityDPPH and ABTS Radical Scavenging ActivitySeveral studies showed that the number and position ofthe substituents on the aromatic ring affects the antioxidantproperties of phenolics; different substituents affect the reactivityand thus, the antioxidant capacity of the phenolic compounds(Shahidi and Ambigaipalan, 2015).The DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays are reliableand commonly used methods for evaluation of the radicalscavenging activity. These measurements are based on thereduction of radical species by electron-transferring or hydrogen-donating radical scavengers. DPPHrmethod is used for anionradicals and ABTSr+ is used for cation radicals. DPPH r is astable free radical, the largest absorbance occurs at 517 nm,and when it reacts with antioxidants free radicals its absorbancedecreases.TABLE 5 | The quantification of iridoids in A. laxmannii extracts (\u00b5g/mL extract).Extract Harpagide Aucubin Catalpol Harpagoside 8-O-acetyl-harpagideA. laxmannii EE 87.4 \u00b1 2.39 7.2 \u00b1 0.41 3.1 \u00b1 0.23 37.2 \u00b1 2.35 266.3 \u00b1 3.92A. laxmannii ME 76.5 \u00b1 2.01 6.9 \u00b1 0.37 2.7 \u00b1 0.19 29.1 \u00b1 1.98 241.4 \u00b1 3.65Values are the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).TABLE 6 | DPPH, TEAC, EPR activity of A. laxmannii (mean \u00b1 SD).Sample DPPH IC50 (\u00b5g/mL) EE DPPH IC50 (\u00b5g/mL) ME TEAC mg TE/g dw EPR mg FS/25\u00b5L EPR mg FS/g dwA. laxmannii 22.64 \u00b1 0.88 24.89 \u00b1 0.83 71.07 \u00b1 2.40 0.266 98.073 \u00b1 1.23Trolox 11.2 \u00b1 0.21Values are the mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3).TABLE 7 | Antibacterial activity of A. laxmannii extracts (MIC, MBC).Bacterial strains MIC (mg/mL) MBC (mg/mL) Gentamycin (\u00b5g/mL)ME EE ME EES. aureus 1.56 0.78 3.12 1.56 0.038P. aeruginosa 3.12 3.12 6.25 6.25 1.2L. monocytogenes 6.25 6.25 12.5 12.5 0.076E. coli 6.25 6.25 12.5 12.5 1.2S. typhimurium 6.25 6.25 12.5 12.5 2.4Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7260fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 10Toiu et al.

In comparison with other research, A. laxmanniishowed a higher antiradical capacity. For example, a studyconcerning antioxidant capacity of A. turkestanica reporteda value of 57.84 \u00b1 4.19 \u00b5g/mL (Mamadalieva et al., 2013),whereas a similar study concerning A. reptans reported aslightly higher value (65.7 \u00b1 3.82 \u00b5g/mL) (Ono et al., 2011).A similar antiradical activity was reported by Movahhedinet al. (2016) for A. chamaecistus subsp. scoparia (Boiss.) Rech.f.(22.69\u00b1 1.30 \u00b5g/mL).2,2\u2032-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)(ABTS) is another free radical used for evaluation of antioxidantcapacity. In the ABTSr+ (TEAC) scavenging assay, the valueof antiradical capacity of A. laxmannii ethanol extract was71.07 \u00b1 2.40 mg TE/g extract (Table 6), which is higherthan the one reported by Movahhedin et al. (2016) forA. chamaecistus subsp. scoparia (Boiss.) Rech.f. (53.87\u00b1 2.11 mgTE/g extract).Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)SpectroscopyTo support the results from the TEAC assay, the Ajuga laxmanniiethanol extract was additionally analyzed using EPR with Fremy\u2019ssalt as a stable radical. EPR is a very common method toassess the antioxidant activity of different samples. The mainadvantage of this assay is the matrix-independent measurementof the reaction between potential antioxidants and radicals inan electro-magnetic field instead of the absorbance of light(Yu and Cheng, 2008). The degraded amount of Fremy\u2019s saltafter 30 min incubation time was 98.07 \u00b1 1.23 mg FS/gextract (Table 6). The EPR is a common, well-characterized,established methodology for detecting radicals and their kinetics.Unfortunately, it is not so frequently used in combinationwith other assays to detect the overall antioxidant activity.Therefore, in this case, a comparison with the results ofFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7261fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 11Toiu et al.

The best antimicrobial activityagainst S. aureus is associated with A. laxmannii ethanol extract(MIC value = 0.78 mg/mL and MBC value = 1.56 mg/mL). Theless susceptible strains were: Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichiacoli and Salmonella typhimurium, for both methanol and ethanolextracts. Previous studies showed a similar trend in terms ofMIC and MBC for A. reptans (Toiu et al., 2017). Accordingto Salvat et al. (2004), herbal extracts with MIC values lessthan/around 0.50 mg/mL indicate good antimicrobial effect.Consequently, the results presented herein showed moderateantibacterial activity.Generally, the bacterial strains were more sensitive to ethanolextract of A. laxmannii. Considering HPLC\u2013MS results presentedin this study, we can derive some assumptions regardingantibacterial activity of A. laxmannii aerial parts.

Moreover, Candida albicans andPenicillium funiculosum were similarly susceptible to theinhibitory (MICs = 0.012 mg/mL) and fungicidal effects(MFCs = 0.025 mg/mL) of the chloroform extract. Nonetheless,the most resistant fungal strains were Candida parapsilosis andCandida albicans, toward petroleum ether extract with MFCs 0.5and 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. According to Kawamura and Ohara(2005), the antifungal activity of plant extracts might be ascribedto the high level of iridoids. Both methanol and ethanol extractsfrom A. laxmannii aerial parts showed high values for iridoidglycosides, especially for 8-O-acetylharpagide. These results arein accordance to previous studies performed by Makni et al.(2013), who similarly demonstrated the antifungal effect of A. ivaextracts.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7263fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 13Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiAnti-inflammatory ActivityThe anti-inflammatory effects of three A. laxmannii ethanolextract concentrations (25 mg dw/mL, 50 mg dw/mL, and100 mg dw/mL) were evaluated in vivo on a model turpentineoil-induced inflammation in rats by determining WBC count,differential WBC count, serum total nitrites and nitrates, TOS,TAR and OSI. These three extract dilutions were also evaluatedin vitro for the ability to inhibit phagocytosis. The 50 mg dw/mLdiluted extract had the best inhibitory activity on phagocytosisand oxidative stress. In conclusion, these results support thehypothesis that extracts from A. laxmannii aerial parts exert anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting phagocytosis through thereduction of oxidative stress (Table 9).Compared to the inflammation group, A. laxmannii ethanolextracts significantly reduced (p < 0.001) total WBC count(Figure 2) by lowering PMN% (Figures 3, 4). That was associatedwith an important decrease of the phagocytosis indices PA(Figure 5) and PI (Figure 6) (p < 0.001). Extracts 50 mg dw/mLand 25 mg dw/mL had the best inhibitory effects (p < 0.001) andthis was comparable to diclofenac activity (p > 0.05).Turpentine-induced inflammation significantly increased(p < 0.001) and treatment with diclofenac significantly reduced(p < 0.001) the TOS (Figure 7). Importantly, the TOSwas also reduced by the treatment with all dilutions of theA. laxmannii extract. The inhibitory effects were strongest forthe 50 mg dw/mL (p < 0.001) and 25 mg dw/mL (p < 0.01)plant extracts. Diclofenac treatment had a similar effect on TOSinhibition (p < 0.01) compared to treatment with either the25 mg dw/mL (p < 0.01) or the 50 mg dw/mL (p < 0.01)extract. The A. laxmannii extract had no important effect on TAR(Figure 8) (p > 0.05).In the inflammation group, the OSI was significantly elevated(p < 0.001), and diclofenac treatment decreased the OSI(p < 0.001) (Figure 9). The 25 mg dw/mL and 50 mg dw/mLextracts of A. laxmannii aerial parts induced a significant declinein OSI (p < 0.001). The 50 mg dw/mL extract was the bestOSI inhibitor (p < 0.001). The 50 mg dw/mL (p < 0.001)and 25 mg dw/mL (p < 0.01) A. laxmannii extract dilutionssignificantly reduced NOx (Figure 10). The OSI correlated withthe TOS (r = 0.92) and NOx (r = 0.81).Compared to diclofenac treatment, A. laxmannii extract hada lower anti-inflammatory and anti-nitro-oxidative stress effectupon all measured parameters (p < 0.001). Among the threeextracts, the 50 mg dw/mL A. laxmannii one had the best effect incomparison with diclofenac.CONCLUSIONIn the present study, the chemical composition, antioxidant,antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties of differentA. laxmannii (from Romania) extracts were evaluated for thefirst time. The major identified compounds were rutin, 8-O-acetylharpagide and \u03b2-sitosterol. The content in polyphenoliccompounds, iridoids and phytosterols could be correlatedwith the evaluated pharmacological effects. The antioxidantactivity of A. laxmannii extracts was assessed using severalmethods, and results showed good antiradical effects. The resultsof the antimicrobial evaluation showed a potent antifungalactivity against C. albicans and P. funiculosum. The anti-inflammatory effect was determined by monitoring someparameters involved in the inflammatory process, and thesefindings could indicate a possible mechanism of action. Theobtained results showed differences between the analyzedextracts; and therefore the importance of choosing the bestsolvent in order to extract the appropriate amounts ofbioactive compounds. A. laxmannii ethanol extract possessedanti-inflammatory effect by reducing total leukocytes, PMN,phagocytosis, and oxidative stress. Compared to diclofenac,only the 50 mg/mL A. laxmannii extract showed better anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects, and this couldjustify the importance of the correlation between the activityand the dose. The results confirm the use of A. laxmanniiin traditional medicine as an anti-inflammatory agent. Furtherresearch is needed in order to deeply comprehend thebioavailability and how processes are involved in the metabolicpathways.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAT, AM, LV, AP, DV, A-MG, and IO conceived and designed thestructure of the manuscript and data collection.

For centuries themultinational population of Russia has used plants in daily diet and for self-medication.The specificity of dietary uptake of medicinal plants (especially those in the uniqueand highly developed Russian herbal medical tradition) has remained mostly unknownin other regions. Based on 11th edition of the State Pharmacopoeia of the USSR,we selected 70 wild plant species which have been used in food by local Russianpopulations. Empirical searches were conducted via the Russian-wide applied onlinedatabase E-library.ru, library catalogs of public libraries in St-Petersburg, the databasesScopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and search engine Google Scholar. The large majorityof species included in Russian Pharmacopoeia are used as food by local population,however, aerial parts are more widely used for food. In this review, we summarize dataon medicinal species published in Russia and other countries that are included in theRussian Pharmacopoeia and have being used in food for a long time. Consequently,the Russian Pharmacopoeia is an important source of information on plant speciesused traditionally at the interface of food and medicine. At the same time, there arethe so-called \u201cfunctional foods\u201d, which denotes foods that not only serves to providenutrition but also can be a source for prevention and cure of various diseases. This reviewhighlights the potential of wild species of Russia monographed in its pharmacopeia forfurther developing new functional foods and\u2014through the lens of their incorporation intothe pharmacopeia\u2014showcases the species\u2019 importance in Russia.Keywords: medicinal plants, traditional use, functional food, health benefits, Russian FederationINTRODUCTIONUntil today over 7000 species have been recorded to be edible (Lim, 2012) and for many of thesespecific health benefits have been claimed, with, however, generally only limited pharmacologicalevidence for such claims. Only a small share of these is used on a large, extensive scale.Wild and cultivated food plants may have medicinal, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and healthbenefits. Plants are excellent sources of active phytochemicals with importance in the preventionof different diseases. Herbal medicinal products are going recognition for the treatment andprophylaxis of different diseases. Direct nutritional benefits of such plants are often known267Shikov et al. Food, Wild Plants, Russian Pharmacopoeiaonly to a limited extend. Herbal infusions will add smallquantities of essential micronutrients and vitamins to the dailyintake. For sick or malnourished individuals this may contributeto restoring the balance between nutrients and thereby improveor sustain health (Lim, 2012).Blurring of the food and medicine interface is a commontheme across multiple contexts and cultures (Heinrich, 2016).The association between food and disease is widely recognizedas the bedrock of preventive nutrition. Throughout the ages, andat least since the proclamation \u201clet food be your medicine, letmedicine be your food\u201d which has been attributed toHippocrates\u2019(ca. 480\u2013377 BC), physicians recognized the impact of food onhuman health. The question of the continuum between food andmedicine is of great interest to (ethno-)pharmacologists (Etkinand Ross, 1982; Leonti, 2012; Valussi and Scire, 2012; Jenningset al., 2014; Alarc\u00f3n et al., 2015).In many countries medicinal plants are widely used as dietarysupplements, in daily foods and as functional foods, with the aimof promoting health. In Eastern cultures food and medicine areseen to come from the same source. Their use is based on thesame fundamental theories, and they are equally important inmaintaining and improving health and for preventing and curingdiseases, as well as facilitating rehabilitation. In China, Japan,Korea, and Southeast Asia, medicinal plants are widely used bothdaily foods (cereals, vegetables, and fruits) and functional foods,for replacement and medical purposes (Shi et al., 2011). Thelast few decades has seen the introduction to Europe of a widerange of species used in other continents, including from SouthAfrica e.g. rooibos (Aspalathus linearis (Burm.f.) R.Dahlgren)and to a lesser extent honey bush tea (Cyclopia sp.) or Hoodiagordonii (Masson) Sweet ex Decne. to regulate the appetite. Alsosome exotic fruits, such as acerola (Malpighia glabra L.) fromSouth America, rich in vitamin C are now marketed as foodsupplements (Franz et al., 2011).In the early history of Western biomedicine, diet figuredprominently in the prevention of diseases and therapeutics.The history of biomedicine customarily is traced to Greece andthe Hyppocratic Corpus, some 60 medical texts dating to thefifth to fourth centuries BCE. Diet regulation was the mostprominent element in all the Hippocratic texts (Etkin, 2006).Due to its location between East and West Russian tradition ofmedicine and diet has accumulated and adopted approaches thatoriginated in Europe and Asia. The Greek influence on Russianmedicine is of particular relevance in this context (Shikov et al.,2014a).Russia in the past and present can be regarded as a\u201cherbophilious\u201d society. The term \u201cherbophilia\u201d was usedby \u0141uczaj (2008) for such cultures, in which medicinaland food plant species are often used and highly prized.Approximately 58% of the Russian population was reported touse phytopharmaceuticals as a form of treatment (Shikov et al.,2011) including wild plants. Plants are an integral part of Russianeveryday life. A large number of species of green vegetables areused in agricultural communities, particularly those in whichfood shortages are frequent. Due to the harsh climatic conditionscoupled with poor crop harvests Russian peasants were educatedon how to survive by relying on wild plants (Kovaleva, 1972).Wild food plants became highest priority in the USSRduring the Second World War most notably during the siegeof Leningrad (1941\u20131944). In 1942 a special manual aboutmost important wild food plants of the Leningrad regionwas published and distributed to the army and civilians. Thescientists from V.L. Komarov Botanical Institute described thirtyseven common herbs and two edible lichens, their nutritionaland functional properties, specificity of harvesting, and foodprocessing (Tikhomirov, 1942).As a result of socio-economic changes after the SecondWorldWar, the active role of wild plants gradually diminished in regulardiet. However, some species are still gathered and made intofood products by small companies. Wild berry harvesting is verypopular especial among of rural populations. The practice ofpreparing jam, compotes, and home made liqueurs from wildberries has been passed down by housewives from generation togeneration (Grigorieva, 2008).A wide choice of herbal medicines or botanicals hasprovided increasing opportunities for both the development andmarketing of herbal food products, dietary supplements, andfunctional foods.Wild species were selected for food application by humansnot only because of their pleasant taste and aroma, but somepharmacological effects were considered as well (Gammermanand Grom, 1976). Herbal medicine products have becomepopular over the past decade and they are widely used forthe treatment and prevention of various diseases. However,safety and efficacy of herbal medicine should be confirmed.Utilization of knowledge about positive pharmacological effectsof edible plants included in in a pharmacopeia is oneof probably safe and effective way for development offunctional products with new beneficial effects (Kunakova et al.,2011).Searching for new food supplements is essential. Systematicexplorations of pharmacopoeial plants are one particularlyrelevant opportunity in Eastern Europe, especially in thoseareas which, for historical reasons, remain relatively isolated.The use and importance of Russian medicinal plants remainslargely unknown in the West. The aim of this review is tosummarize data about species that are referenced in the RussianPharmacopoeia and about their health food value with a primaryfocus on literature published in Russian.OVERVIEW OF SPECIES FROM THERUSSIAN PHARMACOPOEIA USED ASFOODSFor centuries the multinational population of Russia has usedplants in daily diet and for self-medication. The beneficial effectsof plants were carefully collected by \u201cknowledgeable experts\u201d(znahar = \u201c\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0445\u0430\u0440\u044c\u201din Russian) and recorded in chroniclesand manuscripts. In 1778, Russia was among the first countriesto implement a national pharmacopeia: The PharmacopoeiaRossica in St. Petersburg. This work contains 770 monographs,of which 316 texts are on herbal medicinal preparations (Shikovet al., 2014a).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 841268Shikov et al. Food, Wild Plants, Russian PharmacopoeiaSince 1990, the Russian Federation has followed theState Pharmacopoeia of the USSR (1990) 11th edition.This Pharmacopeia includes 83 individual monographsfor plants describing 119 species. There are 26 Rosaceae,12 Compositae (syn. Asteraceae), eight Lamiaceae, sixPolygonaceae, four each of the Apiaceae, Betulaceae, Ericaceae,and Malvaceae species, three representatives each of theSolanaceae, Leguminosae (Fabaceae), and Plantaginaceae,two species each of the Adoxaceae (Caprifoliaceae),Asparagaceae (Liliaceae, s.l), Araliaceae Fagaceae, Gentianaceae,Hypericaceae, Laminariaceae, Pinaceae, Rhamnaceae, andViolaceae, and one member each of the Acoraceae (Araceae),Brassicaceae, Caprifoliaceae (Valerianaceae), Crassulaceae,Cucurbitaceae, Cupressaceae, Equisetaceae, Hymenochaetaceae,Linaceae, Menyanthaceae, Myrtaceae, Papaveraceae, poaceae,Polemoniaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rubiaceae, Saxifragaceae,Schisandraceae, and Urticaceae, respectively.In the most of monographs, just one species is described asa source of plant material. However, 13 species are approvedfor Fructus rosae, 11 species are approved for Fructus crataegi,two species are approved for Herba hyperici, Fructus alni, Herbaviolae etc. Different parts are described for Viburnum opulus L.(Cortex viburni as diuretic and Fructus viburni as diaphoreticand anti-inflammatory) and Crataegus (Flos crataegi\u221213 speciesand Fructus crataegi\u221211 species for cardiovascular problems).The large majority of species included in the RussianPharmacopoeia (98 out of 119) are known to have been usedas food by local population in Russia. For a majority of species,the part of plant used in food and as a medicine is the same.For example, the aerial parts of Origanum vulgare L., Thymusserpyllum L., Leonurus cardiaca L., are used as a medicine andas a food. Acorns and leaves of Quercus robur L. and Q. petraea(Matt.) Liebl. are used in food, while oak bark is used as amedicine. Fruits and bark of Viburnum opulus L. are used asmedicine, with only the fruits being edible. Roots and rhizomesof Acorus calamus L., Taraxacum campylodes G.E.Haglund (syn.Taraxacum officinale L.), and Aralia elata (Miq.) Seem. are usedas a medicine while young sprouts, leaves, flowers and fruits areused in food. The aerial parts of Equisetum arvense L. are usedin medicine, while its cone-bearing shoots and black nodulesattached to the roots are eaten raw in spring.In general, considering all 98 edible plant species in theRussian Pharmacopoeia 11th edition, a higher number of plantparts are used in nutrition as compared to medicine. In thecontext of this article, the term \u201cwild medicinal plants\u201d referringsmainly to non-cultivated species. Twenty one plants includingCalendula officinalis L., Eucalyptus viminalis Labill., Pimpinellaanisum L., Zea mays L., and some others do not occur inRussia outside of cultivation and are excluded from this review.All poisonous and toxic species are not used in food as suchas the species belonging to the Solanaceae (Atropa belladonnaL., Datura stramonium L., Hyoscyamus niger L.), Asparagaceae(Convallaria majalis L., Convallaria keiskei Miq.), Rhamnaceae(Frangula alnus Mill., Rhamnus cathartica L.), Ranunculaceae(Adonis vernalis L.), Papaveraceae (Chelidonium majus L.) andsome species from the newly circumscribed Plantaginaceae(Digitalis purpurea L., Digitalis grandifloraMill.).Consumer andmarketing studies invariably showed that taste,as opposed to perceived nutrition or health value is the keyinfluence on food selection (Drewnowski and Gomez-Carneros,2000). Sensitized to the astringent taste of tannins or some bitterpoisons, humans reject foods that are perceived to be excessivelyastringent or bitter. Polemonium caeruleum L. (Polemoniaceae),Rubia tinctorum L. (Rubiaceae), Alnus incana (L.) Moench andAlnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. (Betulaceae) are not considered tobe edible due to their taste, as well as Gnaphalium uliginosum L.and Bidens tripartita L. (Asteraceae) which, however, are withoutany strong taste.Edible wild species included in the Russian Pharmacopoeiahave a wide range of uses: expectorant, diuretic, astringent,haemostatic, bitterness and choleretic, anti-inflammatory,diaphoretic, tonic, sedative, spasmolytic, polyvitamin,cardiovascular, and antihelminthic (Table 1).Plants with expectorant properties alleviate the symptoms ofpatients in certain stages of bronchitis or tracheitis. Beneficialexpectorant effects are mentioned for nine edible wild species.Certain edible species (nine species) are natural diuretics.Astringent species (eight species) provide not only specifictaste for wine, tea, and other beverages due to high tanninscontent, but are effective in stopping the flow of blood or othersecretions, and resolve diarrhea. Bitterness and choleretic herbs(seven species) are useful for development of functional foodswith digestion-enhancing properties. The haemostatic effectsof herbs (six species) are often due to mechanisms such astannin astringency rather than enhancement of coagulation,although there are a few haemostatic herbs have been shownto reduce clotting times and have inhibitory effects on thePlatelet Aggregation Factor. Four species included in the RussianPharmacopoeia are used for their anti-inflammatory action.In the last decades, so-called natural anti-inflammatory dietshave gained popularity (Sears, 2015). Diaphoretic herbs (fourspecies) induce involuntary perspiration and thus reduce fever,promote circulation, relieve muscle tension, aching joints, andinflammatory skin conditions. These herbs are used as wellto relieve diarrhea, dysentery, kidney nephritis, liver, urinary,and gall bladder. Tonic herbs (four species) as supplement tofood are consumed throughout the world on a daily basis topromote radiant health and are included in many beverages.Motherwort and valerian provide mild sedative effects. Thespecies with spasmolytic effects (two species) are noticeableas components of diets for treatment of gastro-intestinalailments.Hawthorn berries and flowers are useful for the creationof functional products with cardiovascular properties.Antihelmintic properties of tansy are complementary to itscholeretic effects. The well documented anxiolytic effect of L.cardiaca L. may lead to the development of antistress functionalfood products. Increased access to information throughsystematic evaluation of medicinal plants and its nutritionalproperties will support the generation of ideas for functionalfood with new value added properties.Underground parts like roots, shoots and leafy greens, berriesand other fleshy fruits, seeds, and other species commonly yieldwild-harvested foods, a practice which is based on specializedFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 841269Shikov et al.

Food, Wild Plants, Russian Pharmacopoeiacultural knowledge of their harvesting, preparation, cooking andother forms of processing.EDIBLE WILD PLANTS\u2013APPROACHESAND METHODS FOR ASSESSING USESAND EVIDENCEBased on the State Pharmacopoeia of the USSR, we selectedseventy wild species that are used as food in Russia andsystematically searched the scientific literature (publishedbetween 1878-2016) for data using the Russia-wide appliedonline database E-library.ru, library catalogs of public librariesin St-Petersburg, the databases Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed,and search engine Google Scholar. The primary search criterionwas a food application of medicinal plants.Edible wild plants include food categories familiar toeveryone: green vegetables and potherbs, wild berries and fruits,beverages, tea and coffee substitutes, seasonings and spices,sweets, bread surrogates, plants used for preserves. Family namesof the species are based onwww.theplantlist.org database with thenames in the Russian Pharmacopoeia given in brackets (Table 1).Also included are the applications in food.Green Vegetables and PotherbsThis category includes the majority of examined plants.Especially in the spring or at the beginning of their growingseason, many wild species produce tender, edible leaves andshoots, and flowers at the beginning of flowering. Some,like shepherd\u2019s-purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik.),cornflower (Cyanus segetum Hill., syn. Centaurea cyanus L.), andbroadleaf plantain (Plantago major L.) can be eaten raw, afterbeing peeled from soil (Sokolov, 1985, 1990; Tcherepnin, 1987;Grisjuk et al., 1989; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001; Turneret al., 2011), whereas others, like stinging nettles (Urtica dioicaL.) must be steamed or cooked in some way (Litvintsev andKoscheev, 1988; Fedorov, 1984; Toren, 1996). These plants areused for salads, added to soups, borsch, omelets, cooked and usedas a garnish.Many edible greens emerging right after the melting of snoware particularly important for their vitamin C content in thespring and traditionally have been used to prevent and alleviatescurvy. In particularly, soup and borsch with nettles are popularnot only among rural but also many urban people (Gubanovet al., 1976; Koscheev, 1981; Tcherepnin, 1987; Litvintsev andKoscheev, 1988).Tonic properties of shoots of aralia (Aralia elata (Miq.)Seem.)were recognized by Ussuri aborigines (Far East). Young shots nomore than 20 cm are cooked and served as garnish (Izmodenov,1989).Wild Berries and FruitsPresumably, wild berries and fruits are the most favored group ofedible medicinal plants in Russia, and today probably used mostfrequently. The wild fruits most commonly collected in Russiainclude bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), hawthorn (Crataegusspp.), and rose hips (Rosa spp.) (Gubanov et al., 1976; Koscheev,1981; Sokolov, 1987; Tcherepnin, 1987; Grisjuk et al., 1989;Efremova, 1992; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001; Soenov, 2002;\u0141uczaj et al., 2012; S\u00f5ukand et al., 2013; Novruzov, 2014). Allof them are consumed fresh, but some are also preserved forthe winter by making jams, marmalade or pasteurized compotes(Turova and Sapozhnikova, 1989). Furthermore, they are usedto make beverages. Some berries are popular among all groupsof the population (like bilberry), other species that once wereused as a valuable food source in some regions of Russia haveseen that food use diminished because of the bitter or astringenttaste as such as guelder rose (Viburnum opulus L.), bird cherry(Prunus padus L.), and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) (Baikov,1968; Rubtsov, 1971; Gubanov et al., 1976; Sokolov, 1985, 1990;Tcherepnin, 1987; Grisjuk et al., 1989; Toren, 1996; Smertinaet al., 2011). The berries and seeds of Schisandra chinensis(Turcz.) Bail. were eaten by Nanai (Goldes or Samagir) huntersfrom Far Eastern Russia since \u201cit gives forces to follow a sableall the day without food\u201d and were acclaimed as a tonic, toimprove night vision and to reduce hunger, thirst and exhaustion(Panossian and Wikman, 2008).BeverageAerial parts, leaves or flowers are used mainly for makingbeverages, while the underground parts are used rarely. Aromaticplants belonging to the Asteraceae and Lamiaceae are usedto sweeten or to flavor alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages:yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), tansy (Tanacetum vulgareL.), and oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) (Timoshenko, 1940;Wustenfeld and Gesler, 1959; Koscheev, 1981; Berson, 1991;Sokolov, 1991; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001; Soenov, 2002;Kalle and S\u00f5ukand, 2012; S\u00f5ukand et al., 2013). Juicy fruits ofspecies belonging to the Rosaceae (rowan and bird cherry) areused often for coloring of alcoholic beverages and giving a morepronounced flavor. The fruits of these plants are used both inhome made alcoholic beverages as well as in wine- and brewingindustry for the production of liqueurs, bitters, wines, and beers(Wustenfeld and Gesler, 1959; Gubanov et al., 1976; Koscheev,1981; Tcherepnin, 1987; Toren, 1996; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya,2001). Making liqueurs out of rowan berries seems to be an oldhabit that has been in vogue in Russia (Timoshenko, 1940). Thearoma is an important attribute of refreshing soft drinks (kvass,lemonade, and fruit morse), which are popular in the summerseason.Tonic properties of ginseng and aralia were recorded in the FarEastern Russia by hunters and their roots were regularly added toalcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and balsams (Grushvitsky,1961; Zhuravlev and Kolyada, 1996; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya,2001; Palagina et al., 2011; Palagina and Bogoutdinova, 2012).Birch (Betula pendula Roth., and B. pubescens Ehrh.) saphas been gathered all over Russia and was usually seen as arefreshing drink (Fedorov, 1984; Tcherepnin, 1987; Budantsevand Lesiovskaya, 2001). Today, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,Ukraine and Belarus are the only countries where the gatheringand use of birch sap has remained an important. Large birchforests, low population density and the incorporation of sapinto the former Soviet economic system facilitated this (Svanberget al., 2012). Birch sap was utilized the diverse ways as describedFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 841277Shikov et al. Food, Wild Plants, Russian Pharmacopoeiaby the Russian ethnographer Zelenin (1927). It was drunk fresh,but also fermented by adding malt, wax, beans or rye bread.Tea and Coffee SubstitutesAfter water, tea is the second most-consumed beverageworldwide (Keating et al., 2015). Although the English term \u201ctea\u201dgenerally denotes an infusion made of the leaves of Camelliasinensis (L.) Kuntze, many herbal teas, which usually are mono-or polyherbal formulations made from (medicinal) plant(s), areavailable worldwide. Historically in Russia such herbal teas oftenmade from local species were widespread. Samovar and tea-drinking are an indispensable element of Russian culture. WithC. sinensis not being available or affordable to the vast majorityof population, local surrogates/substitutes of tea have been usedfor centuries. The best known tea surrogates were preparedfrom fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium L.) and, in Siberia -Bergenia spp. (Tcherepnin, 1987; Pohlebkin, 1998; Shikov et al.,2006, 2014b; S\u00f5ukand et al., 2013). Prior to the introductionof oriental (black or green) tea in Europe, E. angustifoliumwas esteemed as the \u201coriginal Russian tea\u201d and used widelythroughout Russia and beyond (Litvintsev and Koscheev, 1988;S\u00f5ukand et al., 2013). However, this botanical drug is not inthe Russian Pharmacopoeia. Extracts of black and fermentedleaves of B. crassifolia are reported as appetite and energy intakesuppressants (Shikov et al., 2012). Other species that are usedas substitutes for tea in Russia belong to different families. Firstof all they are expected to bring delicious flavor, taste and nicecolor to the tea. Marsh Labrador tea (Ledum palustre L.), thyme(Thymus serpyllum L.), wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.), arehighly aromatic. Aerial parts of Saint John\u2019s wort (Hypericumperforatum L.), oregano, thyme, leaves of lingonberry (Vacciniumvitis-idaea L.), flowers of linden (Tilia cordata Mill. and T.platyphyllos Scop.) are among the most popular components ofherbal teas in Russia (Krylov, 1972; Koscheev, 1981; Sokolov,1985; Grisjuk et al., 1989; Efremova, 1992; Kalle and S\u00f5ukand,2012). Dry fruits of rose hips, hawthorn, and rowan are usedas substitutes of tea (Gubanov et al., 1976; Tcherepnin, 1987;Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001). Ethnobotanical data alsolists dried and roasted rhizomes of dandelion (Taraxacumcampylodes G.E. Haglund), dry seeds of guelder rose, roastedfruits of hawthorn, and fruits of R. canina L.as coffee substitutes(Klobukova-Alisova, 1958; Vul\u2019f and Maleeva, 1969; Koscheev,1981; Sokolov, 1990, 1993).Seasoning, SpicesAromatic herbs are very important part of local gastronomy,especial for seasoning and as spices in southern Russia. Inparticular, sweet flag (A. calamus L.), valerian (Valerianaofficinalis L.), elecampane (Inula helenium L.) roots andrhizomes, juniper (Juniperus communis L.), and caraway (Carumcarvi L.) fruits, dwarf everlast (Helichrysum arenarium (L.)Moench) and tansy flowers, yarrow, oregano, thyme, andartemisia aerial parts are normally used as aroma and flavorenhancer or digestives (Sokolov, 1988, 1994; Berson, 1991;Mashanov and Pokrovsky, 1991). These species are used bothin culinary preparations at home: they are added to the soupsand main dishes, salads, meats, bakery, as well as in the foodindustry in the production of sausages, confectionery and bakeryproducts.SweetsThe Russian make a kind of sweet flag and elecampane candiedpeel by boiling the transverse root slices in syrup, and drying(Gubanov et al., 1976; Koscheev, 1981; Berson, 1991). Candiedfruits of hawthorn, bird cherry, guelder rose are used assweetness (Gubanov et al., 1976; Koscheev, 1981; Tcherepnin,1987; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001).Bread SurrogatesIn the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuryflour and products like bread derived from it were the mainfoods for Russian peasants. Consequently, every an extendedperiod of bad weather resulting in crop failure resulted in large-scale famines. This explains why a vast variety of plant partswas used for filling bread, including roots, fruits, leaves, andbarks. Roots and rhizomes of some plants are known to be goodsources of starch and carbohydrates. Powdered roots of Persicariabistorta (L.) Samp. were added to the rye flour for baking bread(Rubtsov, 1971; Fedorov, 1984; Tcherepnin, 1987). Bergeniarhizomes were eaten as a substitute for bread (Vereschagin et al.,1959; Tcherepnin, 1987). Flour from black leaves of bergeniais used for cookies (Bugdaeva et al., 2005). Roots of sweet flagwere used as source of starch (Berson, 1991). Whole or crushedcaraway seeds, dried and ground into flour fruits of hawthorn,bird cherry, rowan, guelder rose were added to the pastry whenbaking bread and sweet bakery (cakes and pancakes) (Gubanovet al., 1976; Koscheev, 1981; Tcherepnin, 1987; Budantsev andLesiovskaya, 2001).In the middle of nineteenth century, fruits of guelder rose(Viburnum opulus) were popular in Tver province of Russia asingredients for making \u201ckulaga,\u201d a porridge based on malt flour.Guelder rose fruits tenderized with flour and honey were \u201ca tastycuisine and refined taste for urban residents, not excluding thenobility\u201d (Toren, 1996). Residents of Pskov province received thenickname \u201ckalinniki\u201d because they cooked a delicious porridgewith guelder rose (\u201ckalina\u201d in Russian) berries and licorice flour,which was sold at the bazaar (Toren, 1996).Despite the fact that today wild bread additives have almostcompletely disappeared from the European diet (\u0141uczaj et al.,2012), in Russia some local bakeries produce bread and buns withnettle, hawthorn, and dog rose.Species Used in PreservesHome made preserves have a long tradition in Russia because ofthe long and severe cold season. There are many canning recipesin every household for foods which have been handed down fromgeneration to generation. Plants used for preserves can be dividedinto two large groups. Fresh juicy berries of rose hips, guelderrose, rowan, bird cherry, and bilberry are widely used in jam,comfiture, and marmalade. All these berries are useful for fillingpies (Klobukova-Alisova, 1958; Baikov, 1968; Gubanov et al.,1976; Sokolov, 1985, 1990; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001;Soenov, 2002). The second group includes species used as spicesand condiments for pickling and salting of cabbage, cucumbers,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 841278Shikov et al. Food, Wild Plants, Russian Pharmacopoeiatomatoes and other vegetables, as well as mushrooms: caraway,juniper, and thyme (Rubtsov, 1971; Gubanov et al., 1976;Koscheev, 1981; Tcherepnin, 1987; Litvintsev and Koscheev,1988; Grisjuk et al., 1989; S\u00f5ukand et al., 2013).CONCLUSIONSThis review focuses on botanical drugs with a monograph inthe Russian Pharmacopoeia 11th edition and their potentialas untapped resources beyond their strictly medical uses. Ingeneral, the Soviet period was characterized by the countrybeing closed not only from a political point of view, butalso scientifically. Most commonly, research output was onlyavailable in Russian and not translated into English dramaticallyrestricting its availability to the international community. Heresuch information published in Russian was evaluated focusingon medicinal species from the Russian (Soviet) Pharmacopoeiaand used as a food. This highlights the importance of the RussianPharmacopoeia as a source of information on plant species usedtraditionally at the interface of food and medicine.Clearly our approach has the limitation of only focusing onspecies included in the pharmacopeia and, consequently, localor endemic species are mostly excluded. However, in the contextof developing high value products with potential health benefitspriority needs to be given to species which are widely availableand not at risk of being overexploited if the demand increases.The evidence for the individual species varies, and while wedo not claim that their use could be, based on the current data,evidence-based, the review provides a basis for further researchand development.\u201cFunctional food\u201d are foods that not only serve to providenutrition but also can be a source for prevention and cure ofvarious diseases. This review highlights the potential of wildRussian species monographed in its pharmacopeia for furtherdeveloping new functional foods and\u2014through the lens of theirincorporation into the pharmacopeia\u2014showcases the species\u2019importance in Russia.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAS, AT, OP, and VMhave written the first draft of themanuscript.AS, OP, and MH revised and improved the various drafts andrevisions.

(blackthorn)\u2014a traditional medicinal plant of Centraland Eastern Europe indicated for the treatment of urinary tract disorders, inflammation,and adjunctive therapy of cardiovascular diseases\u2014were evaluated in terms of chemicalcomposition, antioxidant activity, potential anti-inflammatory effects, and cellular safetyin function of fractionated extraction. The UHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS3 fingerprinting led tofull or partial identification of 57 marker constituents (36 new for the flowers), mostlyflavonoids, A-type proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids, and provided the basis forauthentication and standardization of the flower extracts. With the contents up to 584.07mg/g dry weight (dw), 490.63, 109.43, and 66.77 mg/g dw of total phenolics (TPC),flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids, respectively, the extracts were provento be rich sources of polyphenols. In chemical in vitro tests of antioxidant (DPPH, FRAP,TBARS) and enzyme (lipoxygenase and hyaluronidase) inhibitory activity, the extractseffects were profound, dose-, phenolic-, and extraction solvent-dependent. Moreover, atin vivo-relevant levels (1\u20135\u00b5g/mL) the extracts effectively protected the human plasmacomponents against peroxynitrite-induced damage (reduced the levels of oxidativestress biomarkers: 3-nitrotyrosine, lipid hydroperoxides, and thiobarbituric acid-reactivesubstances) and enhanced the total antioxidant status of plasma. The effects observedin biological models were in general dose- and TPC-dependent; only for protein nitrationthe relationships were not significant. Furthermore, in cytotoxicity tests, the extracts didnot affect the viability of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and mightbe regarded as safe. Among extracts, the defatted methanol-water (7:3, v/v) extractand its diethyl ether and ethyl acetate fractions appear to be the most advantageousfor biological applications. As compared to the positive controls, activity of the extractswas favorable, which might be attributed to some synergic effects of their constituents.In conclusion, this research proves that the antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory capacityof phenolic fractions should be counted as one of the mechanisms behind the activity282Marchelak et al. Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower Extractsof the flowers reported by traditional medicine and demonstrates the potential of theextracts as alternative ingredients for functional products supporting the treatment ofoxidative stress-related pathologies cross-linked with inflammatory changes, especiallyin cardiovascular protection.Keywords: Prunus spinosa, oxidative stress, antioxidants, human plasma, lipoxygenase, hyaluronidase,polyphenols, LC-MSINTRODUCTIONMedicinal plants as primary sources of natural bioactivecompounds are attracting growing interest as constituents offunctional products active in prevention and adjunctive therapyof numerous chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disorders(CVD), the leading cause of mortality in the world today. In thesearch of new candidates for closer investigation, ethnobotanicalknowledge constitutes an important guideline indicating specieswith the relevant activity (Franz et al., 2011).One of such plants might be Prunus spinosa L. (blackthornor sloe)\u2014a wild plume tree native to Europe, western Asia,north-western Africa, and naturalized in New Zealand andNorth America (Tutin et al., 1968). In European tradition ithas been known for over 7,000 years, at first as a sourceof edible fruit and then also as a medicinal plant (Poonamet al., 2011; Zohary et al., 2012), used i.a. in the treatment ofvarious circulatory system disorders. For medicinal applicationsthe plant has been used throughout Europe with the flowersbeing the most popular in central and eastern parts ofthe continent (Hoppe, 1981). Ethnopharmacological sourcesindicate vasoprotective, anti-inflammatory, diuretic, detoxifying(blood purifying), and spasmolytic activities for the flowers,and document their use as ingredients of compound herbalprescriptions traditionally applied, e.g., to treat intestinal andrespiratory tract disorders, but also various cardiac complaints,such as myocarditis, cardiac neurosis and atherosclerosis(Berger, 1949; Hoppe, 1981; Wawrzyniak, 1992; Blumenthal andBusse, 1998). The fruits, according to German CommissionE, have been indicated mainly in mild inflammation ofthe oral and pharyngeal mucosa, as well as an astringent(Blumenthal and Busse, 1998); however, local European sourcesreport their use also as a heart-strengthening remedy (K\u00fclt\u00fcr,2007; Jaric\u00b4 et al., 2015). Branches, on the other hand, havebeen more popular in the south of Europe and suggestedto possess anti-hypertensive properties (Calvo and Cavero,2014).Active components of the plant are believed to be polyphenols,including flavonoids, A-type proanthocyanidins, anthocyanins,coumarins, and phenolic acids, forming unique and diversifiedprofiles in particular organs, among which the flowers are theleast characterized (Kolodziej et al., 1991; Sakar and Kolodziej,1993; Olszewska and Wolbis\u00b4, 2001, 2002a,b; Guimar\u00e3eset al., 2013; Pinacho et al., 2015; Owczarek et al., 2017).Some blackthorn constituents, such as flavonoid pentosides(arabinosides, xylosides, rhamnosides) and A-type procyanidindimers with twice-bonded structures are quite rare in natureand their distribution is generally limited to selected species andplant families (Pinacho et al., 2015). This unique compositionmay correspond to the distinctive activity profile of P. spinosareported by traditional medicine. Indeed, the earliest studiessuggested that the flavonoid fraction of blackthorn flowerssignificantly reduces capillary permeability and shows anti-inflammatory effects in animal internal organs, normalizesthe blood cholesterol and cholesterol/phospholipid ratio inatherogenic rabbits, exhibits spasmolytic effects on isolatedintestinal segments from different animals, and increases theamplitude of heart contractions in perfusion of isolated froghearts (Lisevitskaya et al., 1968; Makarov, 1968, 1972; Makarovand Khadzhai\u02c7, 1969). However, despite these promising in vivoand ex vivo results, the potential of blackthorn, especially theblackthorn flowers, as a source of biologically active extracts(that means standardized dry extracts\u2014more effective thanunprocessed plant materials and recommended in modernphytotherapy) remains unexplored, and the plant materials arestill used mostly in the form of traditional herbal teas, partly dueto the lacking molecular background for their activity and safety.Recently, special attention has been given to the antioxidantactivity of the extracts from the branches, leaves, and fruits,as one of the possible mechanism of action of the blackthornpolyphenols (Barros et al., 2010; Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2014; Pinachoet al., 2015). Nevertheless, as these studies were based only onsimple, mostly chemical tests, and did not cover the flowerextracts, the subject requires more detailed investigations.Polyphenols, including flavonoids, are specialized plantmetabolites, the beneficial effects of which in CVD is commonlylinked with their ability to influence two interdependentpathological processes of oxidative/nitrative stress andinflammation (Biswas, 2016). As free radical scavengers,metal chelators, inhibitors of pro-inflammatory enzymes, andmodifiers of cell signaling pathways, polyphenols may protectcellular and functional elements of the circulatory system againstlipid peroxidation, protein nitration, chronic inflammation, andoxidative damage to DNA, which results i.a. in vasodilatory,vasoprotective, anti-atherogenic, antithrombotic, and anti-apoptotic effects (Alissa and Ferns, 2012; Qui\u00f1ones et al., 2013).Moreover, the reducing polyphenols and their metabolites canincrease the total antioxidant capacity of blood plasma andthus the tolerance of body tissues against ischemic/reperfusioninjuries (Pandey and Rizvi, 2009).Therefore, the aim of this project was a comprehensivecharacteristic of the flowers of P. spinosa in a function offractionated extraction with respect to the chemical compositionand biological activity of the dry extracts obtained with solventsof different polarity. Phenolic profiles of the extracts wereinvestigated by UHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS3, HPLC-PDA, and UV-spectrophotometric methods, while their biological effects werestudied in vitro by nine complementary tests (both chemical andFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 680283Marchelak et al. Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower Extractshuman plasma models) covering some of the main mechanismsof the beneficial action of polyphenols in CVD, includingdirect scavenging of free radicals, inhibition of pro-inflammatoryenzymes, enhancement of the total antioxidant capacity ofblood plasma and protection against oxidative and nitrativedamage of its lipid and protein components. Moreover, therelationship between activity of the extracts and the presenceof different groups of polyphenolic constituents was exploredstatistically. Additionally, cellular safety of the extracts wasevaluated in vitro in cytotoxicity tests against human peripheralblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).MATERIALS AND METHODSGeneralHPLC grade reagents and standards, such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH); 2,2\u2032-azobis-(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride (AAPH); 2,4,6-tris-(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine(TPTZ); (\u00b1)-6-hydroxy-2,2,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox R\u00a9); gallic acid monohydrate; chlorogenicacid hemihydrate; caffeic acid; kaempferol; quercetin trihydrate;isorhamnetin; rutin trihydrate; cyanidin chloride; indomethacin;bovine testis hyaluronidase; lipoxygenase from soybean; linoleicacid; 2-thiobarbituric acid; were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich(Seelze, Germany/St. Louis, MO, USA), as were analyticalgrade butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA); 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT); Tween R\u00a9 40; xylenol orange disodiumsalt; and Histopaque R\u00a9-1077 medium. HPLC grade solvents(acetonitrile and methanol) used for UHPLC and HPLC analyseswere obtained from Avantor Performance Materials (Gliwice,Poland). A (Ca2+)-free phosphate buffered saline (PBS) waspurchased from Biomed (Lublin, Poland). Peroxynitrite wassynthesized according to Pryor et al. (1995). All immunoreagentsfor 3-nitrotyrosine detection were purchased from Abcam(Cambridge, UK). Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit was obtainedfrom Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). All otherchemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and obtainedfrom Avantor (Poland). In all analyses redistilled waterwas used. For chemical tests samples were incubated ina constant temperature using a BD 23 incubator (Binder,Tuttlingen, Germany) and measured using a UV-1601 Rayleighspectrophotometer (Beijing, China), in 10mm quartz cuvettes.Activity tests in blood plasma models and enzyme inhibitoryassays were done using 96-well plates and a microplate reader,SPECTROStar Nano (BMG LabTech, Ortenberg, Germany).Plant Material and Extracts PreparationCommercial samples of Prunus spinosa L. flowers were purchasedin 2015 (harvest in April 2015) from Dary Natury (Koryciny,Poland). According to the manufacturer, the raw material wascollected in the district Rudka, Malopolska province (50\u25e602\u2032N,20\u25e652\u2032E). The raw material was powdered with an electricgrinder, and sieved through a 0.315-mm sieve. A portion (100 g)was extracted with chloroform (3 L, 30 h) in a Soxhlet apparatusand the pellet was next four times refluxed with methanol-water (7:3, v/v; 4 \u00d7 1 L) to give the defatted methanol extract(MED, 27.3 g dw). The extraction solvent was selected frommethanol-water mixtures of different alcohol concentration afteroptimization performed in terms of extracts yield and totalphenolic content (results not shown). The MED (25.0 g) wassuspended in water (1 L) and subjected to sequential liquid-liquid extraction with organic solvents (8 \u00d7 100 mL each)to yield diethyl ether fraction (DEF, 1.23 g dw), ethyl acetatefraction (EAF, 4.00 g dw), n-butanol fraction (BF, 4.86 g dw) andwater residue (WR, 13.08 g dw). The organic solvent extractswere evaporated in vacuo, and the water-containing fractionswere lyophilized using an Alpha 1\u20132/LD Plus freeze dryer(Christ, Osterode amHarz, Germany) before weighing. In furtheranalyses freshly prepared solutions of the extracts in methanol-water (7:3, v/v) were used. All quantitative results were calculatedper dry weight (dw) of the extracts.Phytochemical ProfilingQualitative LC-MS StudyThe UHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS3 analysis was performed on UHPLC-3000 RS system (Dionex, Dreieich, Germany) equipped witha dual low-pressure gradient pump, an autosampler, a columncompartment, a diode array detector, and an AmaZon SL iontrap mass spectrometer with an ESI interface (Bruker Daltonik,Bremen, Germany). Separations were carried out on a KinetexXB-C18 column (1.7 \u00b5m, 150mm \u00d7 2.1mm i.d.; Phenomenex,Torrance, CA, USA) at 25\u25e6C. The mobile phase consistedof solvent A (water/formic acid, 100:0.1, v/v), and solvent B(acetonitrile/formic acid, 100:0.1, v/v) with the elution profile asfollows: 0\u201310 min, 6\u201313% B (v/v); 10\u201315 min, 13% B (v/v); 15\u201319min, 13\u201315% B (v/v); 19\u201324 min, 15% B (v/v); 24\u201340 min, 15\u201323% B (v/v); 40\u201355 min, 23\u201340% B (v/v); 55\u201360 min, 40% B (v/v);60\u201363 min, 40\u20136% B (v/v); 63-70 min, 6% B (equilibration). Theflow rate was 0.3 mL/min. Before injection, sample solutions ofthe extracts (3.0 mg/mL) were filtered through a PTFE syringefilter (13mm, 0.2 \u00b5m, Whatman, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). UV-Vis spectra were recorded over a range of 200\u2013600 nm, andchromatograms were acquired at 254, 280, and 350 nm. TheLC eluate was introduced directly into the ESI interface withoutsplitting and analyzed in both negative and positive ion modes.ESI parameters: the nebulizer pressure was 40 psi; dry gas flow 9L/min; dry temperature 300\u25e6C; and capillary voltage 4.5 kV. MS2and MS3 fragmentations were obtained in Auto MS/MS modefor the most abundant ions at the time. Analysis was carried outusing scan from m/z 200\u20132,200.Quantitative StandardizationThe total phenolic contents (TPC) and total proanthocyanidincontents (TPA) were quantified by the Folin-Ciocalteu andn-butanol-HCl methods, respectively, as described previously(Olszewska et al., 2012). Results were expressed as equivalentsof gallic acid (GAE) and cyanidin chloride (CYE), respectively.The total flavonoid contents (TFA) were determined by HPLC-PDA as the total content of flavonoid aglycones after acidhydrolysis. Samples of the extracts (1\u20135 mg) were heated underreflux for 30 min with methanol-water (9:1, v/v; 30 mL) and25% (w/v) hydrochloric acid (9 mL). The hydrolysates werediluted with methanol-water (7:3, v/v) to 50 mL, filtered througha PTFE syringe filter (as above) and injected (5 \u00b5L) intoFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 680284Marchelak et al. Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower Extractsthe HPLC system. The HPLC-PDA assays were carried outaccording to Olszewska (2012) with quercetin, kaempferol andisorhamnetin used for external calibration. Results were re-calculated for total contents of glycosides with the molecularmasses of avicularin, juglanin, and isorhamnetin diglucoside,correspondingly. The total contents of phenolic acids (TAC) wereassayed by HPLC-PDA according to Olszewska et al. (2012) withcaffeic acid and chlorogenic acid used as calibration standards forquantification of simple hydroxycinnamic acids and quinic acidpseudodepsides, respectively.Antioxidant Activity in Chemical ModelsThe DPPH free-radical scavenging activity was determinedaccording to the method optimized previously (Olszewskaet al., 2012) and expressed as normalized EC50 valuescalculated from concentration-inhibition curves. The FRAP(Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) was determined accordingto Olszewska et al. (2012) and expressed in \u00b5mol of ferrousions (Fe2+) produced by 1 g of the dry extract or standard,which was calculated from the calibration curve of ferroussulfate. The ability of the extracts to inhibit AAPH-inducedperoxidation of linoleic acid (LA) was assayed as describedpreviously (Olszewska et al., 2012) with peroxidation monitoredby quantification of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances(TBARS) according to the method of Kljak and Grbe\u0161a (2015)with some changes. Briefly, before and after the sampleswere incubated for 3 h at 50.0 \u00b1 0.1\u25e6C in the dark, thereaction solution (0.5 mL) was mixed with 0.67% (w/w)aqueous thiobarbituric acid (1 mL), 0.05M HCl (0.5 mL),Tween R\u00a940 (1 mL), and then heated for 30 min in thewater bath at 95\u25e6C. The absorbance was measured at 535nm vs. the control with methanol-water (7:3, v/v) insteadof the reaction mixture. The inhibition ratio (I%) of theLA-peroxidation was calculated as follows: I% = (1Acontrol\u2212 1Asample)/1Acontrol, where 1A is the difference betweenthe absorbance measured before and after incubation. Finally,antioxidant activity was expressed as IC50 values calculated fromconcentration-inhibition curves.Antioxidant Activity in Human PlasmaModelsIsolation of Blood Plasma and Preparation ofSamplesBlood from five healthy, non-smoking volunteers wasobtained from the Regional Centre of Blood Donationand Blood Treatment in Lodz (Poland), collected on CPD(citrate/phosphate/dextrose) solution in the Fresenius-KabiCompoflex bags, and next plasma was isolated by differentialcentrifugation of blood (Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et al., 2013). Allexperiments were approved by the committee on the Ethics ofResearch at the University of Lodz 8/KBBN-U\u0141/II/2015. Forthe FRAP assay and measurements of 3-nitrotyrosine, plasmasamples were diluted with a (Ca2+)-free PBS buffer (1:4, v/v),whereas for hydroperoxide and TBARS assays plasma wasdiluted with (Ca2+)-free PBS in a volume ratio 1:1. For all tests,samples were pre-incubated for 5 min at 37\u25e6C with the examinedextracts added to the final concentration range of 1\u201350\u00b5g/mL,and then exposed to 100 \u00b5M peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212). Controlsamples were prepared with plasma untreated with the extractsand/or peroxynitrite. In the experiments with blood plasma andthe extracts only (without adding ONOO\u2212) no pro-oxidativeeffect was found. Protein concentration in blood plasma wasestimated using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (according toprotocol provided by the manufacturer).Determination of 3-Nitrotyrosine in Human PlasmaProteinsDetection of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins by thecompetitive ELISA (C-ELISA) method in plasma samples(control or antioxidants and ONOO\u2212-treated plasma) wasperformed according to Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et al. (2013). Theconcentrations of nitrated proteins were estimated from thestandard curve and are expressed as the 3NT-Fg equivalents (innmol/mg of plasma protein).Ferric-Xylenol Orange Hydroperoxide AssayConcentration of hydroperoxides in plasma samples (controlor antioxidants and ONOO\u2212-treated plasma) was determinedby a ferric-xylenol orange (FOX-1) protocol (Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et al., 2013). The FOX-1 reagent contained 125 \u00b5Mxylenol orange and 100mM sorbitol in 25mM sulfuric acid, andwas freshly prepared each time before use by the addition ofammonium ferrous sulfate to the final concentration of 250 \u00b5M.To perform FOX-1 assay, blood plasma samples were mixed withthe reagent in a volume ratio 1:9 and incubated for 30 min inthe dark (25\u25e6C). Absorbance of the sample was measured at560 nm against blank (water instead of plasma). The amount oflipid hydroperoxides was calculated from the standard curve ofhydrogen peroxide and expressed in nmol/mg of plasma proteins.TBARS TestDetermination of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances(TBARS) in plasma samples (control or antioxidants andONOO\u2212-treated plasma) was performed according toKolodziejczyk et al. (2011). Results were expressed in \u00b5molTBARS/mL of plasma.Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) AssayThe influence of the extracts on the total antioxidant activityof plasma (dependent on non-enzymatic antioxidants) wasdetermined according to Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et al. (2014) withsome modifications. The freshly collected plasma samples werediluted with a (Ca2+)-free PBS buffer in a volume ratio of 1:4,prepared as described above, and then added to the reagentmixture in a volume ratio of 1:10:1:1 for plasma, acetate buffer(300mM, pH 3.6), TPTZ (10mM, in 0.04M hydrochloric acid),and ferric chloride (20mM), respectively. After incubation for 15min at 37\u25e6C, the measured FRAPs of plasma samples (controlor antioxidants and ONOO\u2212-treated plasma) were expressed inmM Fe2+ in plasma.Inhibition of Pro-Inflammatory EnzymesThe ability of the extracts to inhibit lipoxygenase (LOX) andhyaluronidase (HYAL) was examined as described by Michelet al. (2017) with some changes. Briefly, in the LOX tests thereagents were used in a volume ratio of 1:2:1 for workingsolutions of the tested analyte, linoleic acid, and enzyme. ResultsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 680285Marchelak et al. Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower Extractsof the both assays were expressed as IC50 values calculated fromconcentration-inhibition curves.Cell Viability AssayPBMCs were isolated from human blood (obtained and collectedas described above) using the Histopaque R\u00a9-1077 medium (asterile solution of polysucrose, 57 g/L, and sodium diatrizoate,90 g/L, with a density of 1.077 g/mL). From each of eightdonors, two independent PBMCs isolations and incubationswith the extracts were performed. Blood was carefully layered(in a volume ratio of 1:1) onto the medium, and centrifugedfor 30 min (400 \u00d7 g, at room temperature). Then, the pelletwas washed two times with 0.02M PBS buffer. The obtainedfraction of PBMCs was suspended in PBS. Cell suspensions (1\u00d7 106 PBMCs/mL) were incubated with plant extracts, addedto the final concentration of 5\u00b5g/mL. Cell viability (%) wasdetermined during a spectrofluorimetric analysis, involving theuse of propidium iodide as a fluorescent dye. Measurements wereconducted using a microchip-type automatic cell counter Adam-MC DigitalBio (NanoEnTek Inc., Seoul, Korea), after 60 and120 min of incubation of PBMCs with the examined substances(at 37\u25e6C). The procedure was carried out according to themanufacturer\u2019s protocol.Statistical AnalysisNormality of the distribution of the results was verified using theShapiro-Wilk test, and the homogeneity of variances using theLevene\u2019s test. The results are reported as means \u00b1 SD (standarddeviation) or \u00b1 SE (standard error) for the indicated number ofexperiments. The significance of differences between samples andcontrols was determined with one-way ANOVA (for chemicaltests) or one-way ANOVA for repeated measures (for humanplasma model), followed by the post-hoc Tukey\u2019s test for multiplecomparisons. The correlations were evaluated using F-test. Allcalculations were performed using the Satistica12Pl software forWindows (StatSoft Inc., Krakow, Poland) with p-values less than0.05 regarded as significant.RESULTSLC-MS Metabolite ProfilingPhytochemical profiling of the dry extracts revealed significantdifferences in their chemical composition depending on theextraction solvent (Figure 1, Tables 1, 2).

(2003), the peaks showingparent [M\u2013H]\u2212 ions at m/z 353, 337, and 367 were identifiedas isomeric caffeoylquinic acids (chlorogenic acids; 1, 4, 8),p-coumaroylquinic acids (3, 10, 12), and feruloylquinic acids(6, 14), correspondingly. The identity of chlorogenic acids wasadditionally confirmed by experiments with standards, as was thepresence of simple caffeic (7) and p-coumaric acids (13) givingthe typical [M\u2013H]\u2212 ions at m/z 179 and 163, respectively. Thesame ions were found in MS2 spectra of compounds 2 and 9after neutral losses of sugar moieties (\u2013162 Da each), which led tothe tentative identification of hexosides of caffeic acid and ferulicacid, respectively.Peaks 5, 11, 16, 18, 28, 30, and 37 with UV maxima at280 nm were classified as flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins.Based on standard spiking and literature data, compounds5 and 11 were characterized as (+)-catechin and (\u2212)-epicatechin, respectively. Compounds 16, 18, and 28 withparent ions [M+H]+ at m/z 577 were classified as dimericA-type procyanidins. These compounds gave secondary ionsin MS2 spectra at m/z 559, 425, and 287. The ions atm/z 425, arising from retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) fission of the[M+H]+ (577\u2013152 Da), and the ions at m/z 287 (577\u2013290Da) resulting from quinone methide (QM) fission, confirmedthe presence of two (epi)catechin units in the structures (Liand Deinzer, 2008; Hamed et al., 2014). Compounds 16, 18,and 28 were thus tentatively identified as (epi)catechin-A-(epi)catechins. Two A-type proanthocyanidins of that kindhave already been isolated from the flowers of P. spinosaand identified as ent-epicatechin-(4\u03b1\u21928;2\u03b1\u2192O\u21927)-catechinand ent-epicatechin-(4\u03b1\u21928;2\u03b1\u2192O\u21927)-epicatechin (Kolodziejet al., 1991). Compounds 30 and 37 with pseudomolecular[M+H]+ ions at m/z 561 and ions in MS2 spectra at m/z 543,409 and 271 were classified as dimeric A-type proanthocyanidins.The mass difference between compounds 16, 18, 28, and 30,37 was 16 Da, which indicated that in the latter molecules one(epi)catechin unit is probably replaced by (epi)afzelechin, theflavan-3-ol reported to occur in blackthorn flowers (Kolodziejet al., 1991) and branches (Pinacho et al., 2015). m/z 409(561\u2013152 Da) arising from RDA fission of the [M+H]+ ion,confirmed the presence of (epi)catechin in both compounds.On the other hand, the product ions at m/z 271 (561\u2013290Da) resulting from QM fission of the [M+H]+ ions, showedthat the upper unit in both cases was (epi)afzelechin, andhence the terminal unit must be (epi)catechin, m/z 287 (Liand Deinzer, 2008; Hamed et al., 2014). The structures ofcompounds 30 and 37 were thus tentatively identified as(epi)afzelechin-A-(epi)catechin. Two proanthocyanidins of thattype, i.e., ent-epiafzelechin-(4\u03b1\u21928;2\u03b1\u2192O\u21927)-epicatechin andent-epiafzelechin-(4\u03b1\u21928;2\u03b1\u2192O\u21927)-catechin have previouslybeen isolated from blackthorn flowers (Kolodziej et al., 1991).Peaks 15, 17, 19\u201321, 23\u201327, 29, 31\u201336, 38\u201354, and 56\u201359withtwo UV-Vis maxima at 250\u2013268 and 355\u2013365 nm were classifiedas flavonoids. Compounds 52 and 56 showed parent [M\u2013H]\u2212ions at m/z 301 and 285, respectively, and were identified withstandards as free aglycones quercetin and kaempferol. Peaks 23,26, 35, 36, 44, 47\u201349, 54, 57, and 59 with fragment ions in MS2m/z 285 (typical for kaempferol) were identified with authenticstandards of kaempferol glycosides (Table 1). Compounds 15,32, 33, 38, 42, 43, 45, and 46 were tentatively characterizedbased on their fragmentation pattern as kaempferol mono- anddiglycosides. Peak 53 with parent [M\u2013H]\u2212 ion at m/z 635 andfragment ions at m/z 593, 285 in MS spectra was tentativelyidentified as kaempferol acetyl hexoside-rhamnoside due to theneutral loss of an acetyl moiety (\u221242 Da), hexose (\u2212162 Da)and rhamnose (\u2212146 Da). Peaks 24, 25, 27, 31, 34, 39\u201341, and50 with fragment ions in MS3 spectra at m/z 301 (typical forFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 680289Marchelak et al. Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower Extractsquercetin) were identified with standards of quercetin glycosides(Table 1). Compound 21 with pseudomolecular [M\u2013H]\u2212 ion atm/z 595 and fragment ion at m/z 301 was tentatively assignedto quercetin hexoside-pentoside. Peak 51 with parent ion at m/z651 and fragment ions at m/z 609, 447, and 301 was determinedas a quercetin analog of 53, i.e., quercetin acetyl hexoside-rhamnoside. Similarly, compound 58was tentatively identified asan analog of 59, i.e., quercetin p-coumaroyl-pentoside, probablyquercetin 3-O-(2\u2032\u2032-E-p-coumaroyl)-\u03b1-L-arabinofuranoside, dueto the additional UV-Vis absorptionmaximum at 316 nm (typicalfor an aromatic acyl unit), and the neutral loss of p-coumaroylmoiety (\u2212146 Da) and a pentose (\u2212132 Da). Peak 17 gave theparent ion at m/z 639 and its MS spectra revealed the cleavage oftwo hexoses (\u2212162 amu twice) and the aglycone signal consistentwith isorhamnetin, which enabled tentative identification ofisorhamnetin dihexoside.Quantitative StandardizationAccording to the LC-MS findings, total contents of polyphenols(TPC), flavonoids (TFC), proanthocyanidins (TPA), andphenolic acids (TAC) were selected as standardization targets(Table 2). The TPC levels assayed by the standard Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed in gallic acid equivalents (GAE)varied in the range of 64.6\u2013584.07 mg GAE/g dw of the extractswith the highest values found for EAF (584.07 mg GAE/g dw)and DEF (464.57 mg GAE/g dw). The total flavonoid content(TFC) was determined by HPLC-PDA as a sum of flavonoidaglycones released after acid hydrolysis of native extracts,and recalculated on the dominant glycosides. With the levelsconstituting 55.7\u2013105.5% of the TPC values, flavonoids were thedominant phenolic components of all extracts except WR, inwhich phenolic acids prevailed. The highest TFC contents wereobserved for DEF (490.63 mg/g dw) and EAF (325.53 mg/g dw).As regards individual aglycones, kaempferol was the dominantone and constituted 64.4\u201379.7% of the total aglycones. Thecontents of quercetin and isorhamnetin were much lower andconstituted 18.8\u201330.9% and 1.6\u20134.7% of the sum of aglycones,respectively. The total TPA, determined by the n-butanol-HClassay and expressed as cyanidin chloride equivalents (CYE),ranged from 12.43 to 109.43 mg CYE/g dw, with the peak valuefound again for EAF. Contrastingly, the highest level of phenolicacids (TAC), assayed by HPLC-PDA, was observed for BF (66.77mg/g dw), while in other extracts the TAC contents varied in therange of 8.76\u201329.24 mg/g dw.Antioxidative Effects in Chemical ModelsAll of the extracts showed significant and dose-dependentantioxidant activity and ability to scavenge free radicals (DPPH,a stable synthetic radical), directly reduce transition metalions (Fe3+, FRAP), and inhibit AAPH-induced linoleic acidperoxidation (chemical model of lipid peroxidation) significantlydiminishing levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances(TBARS), with the final parameters strongly influenced by theextraction solvent (Table 3). Regardless of the test, activityof the extracts decreased in similar order, i.e., EAF \u2265 DEF> BF > MED > WR, and correlated with the amountsof polyphenols (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC) in the samples(Table 4). The strongest relationships were observed for theFRAP test, whereas for the DPPH and TBARS assays, thecorrelation coefficients were negatively influenced by WR, avirtually flavonoid-free extract. If WR was excluded from thedata matrix, the impact of TPC (|r| > 0.91, p < 0.05) on theantioxidant parameters of the other extracts was evident forall tests (results not shown). In a comparison to the positivestandards, the antioxidant capacity of the most active extractsEAF and DEF was higher (p < 0.05) or not statisticallydifferent (p > 0.05) than that of an industrial antioxidantBHT (DPPH and TBARS tests), and Trolox, a synthetic analogof vitamin E (FRAP and TBARS tests). Moreover, if activityparameters of the native extracts were recalculated to GAE(Table 3) using the TPC values, the obtained antioxidantcapacities of the phenolic fractions constituting the dry extractswere comparable to all of the positive standards exceptquercetin.Protective Effects on Human PlasmaComponentsAfter demonstrating the promising antioxidant capacity inchemical assays, the extracts were examined in terms of theireffects on human plasma exposed to oxidative stress inducedby peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212; 100 \u00b5M). In comparison to thecontrol (untreated) samples, the peroxynitrite-stimulated plasmaexhibited a considerably enhanced level (Figure 2A; p < 0.001)of 3-nitrotyrosine in plasma proteins (3-NT-Fg, a marker ofprotein nitration), a strong increase of lipid hydroperoxides(ferric-xylenol orange assay, FOX-1) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)\u2014markers of lipid peroxidation(Figures 2B,C; p < 0.001), as well as a noticeable decrease(Figure 2D; p < 0.001) in ferric reducing ability (FRAP, amarker of total antioxidant status of plasma). In plasmasamples incubated with ONOO\u2212 in the presence of the extracts(at 1\u201350\u00b5g/mL), the rate of oxidative/nitrative damage wassignificantly reduced (Figures 2A\u2013C; p < 0.05). All testedextracts effectively diminished the nitration of tyrosine residues(Figure 2A; p < 0.001)\u2014by about 15\u201350% and 36\u201354% at 1and 50\u00b5g/mL, respectively. The impact of extraction solventon the anti-nitrative activity was less pronounced than thatobserved in chemical tests; still, WR was again the leasteffective at each concentration level (p < 0.05). Among theother extracts, MED displayed the strongest activity (50\u201358%decrease in tyrosine nitration); however, only the effects ofEAF, BF, and WR were dose-dependent (Figure 2A; p <0.05). In consequence, the correlation between the percentageinhibition of tyrosine nitration and the phenolic contents(TPC, TFC, TPA, TAC) was not significant (Table 4). All ofthe tested extracts exhibited also protective properties againstperoxynitrite-induced lipid peroxidation (Figures 2B,C; p <0.001), regardless of the concentration level. In samples pre-incubated with the medium extracts concentration (5\u00b5g/mL),the levels of hydroperoxides and TBARS decreased by about47\u201353% and 21\u201334%, respectively.

The inhibitoryactivity on lipid peroxidation was dose-dependent for all extractsif measured by TBARS (Figure 2C; p < 0.05); however, inthe FOX-1 assay only some dose-effects for MED, DEF andEAF were significant, i.e., differences observed between the twolowest concentration levels (1\u20135\u00b5g/mL) and the highest doseof 50\u00b5g/mL (Figure 2B; p < 0.05). Consequently, relativelystrong correlations (|r| > 0.73, p < 0.01) were observed betweenthe percentage of lipid peroxidation assayed by TBARS andthe phenolic contents (TPC, TFC, TPA), whereas the analogrelationships for FOX-1 test were weaker (|r| > 0.62, p <0.01) (Table 4). All of the extracts were also able to normalizeand/or enhance the total antioxidant status of ONOO\u2212-treated plasma (FRAP), depending on the concentration used,and only MED at 1\u00b5g/mL did not change significantly theFRAP value of the oxidized plasma (Figure 2D; p > 0.05).For all other extracts, a significant improvement in theplasma reducing ability was observed with the increase upto about 190% vs. the ONOO\u2212-stimulated plasma and 140%vs. the control sample for EAF at 50\u00b5g/mL (Figure 2D; p< 0.001). Strong dose-dependency of the analytical responsewas found, and thus strong relationships (|r| > 0.92, p <0.001) between the percentage increase in the FRAP valuesof the oxidized plasma and the TPC, TFC, and TPA levels(Table 4).Simultaneously, the ONOO\u2212-treated plasma was incubatedwith 5\u00b5g/mL of standard phenolics (Figures 2A\u2013D). In contrastto results of the chemical tests, in the plasma model thepure compounds were merely comparable or inferior to theblackthorn extracts in terms of the antioxidant activity. Forinstance, the range of percentage inhibition of tyrosine nitrationachieved for the standards (ca. 11\u201334%) was lower than forthe extracts (ca. 19\u201358%) applied at the same concentrationof 5\u00b5g/mL (Figure 2A). Moreover, the activity of MED andEAF at 5\u00b5g/mL was significantly higher (p < 0.001) thanthat of all standards. Furthermore, quercetin\u2014the strongestantioxidant in chemical models\u2014counteracted the plasmanitration significantly less effectively than all extracts (Figure 2A;p < 0.001). Similar trend was observed for ONOO\u2212-inducedlipid peroxidation, both with FOX-1 detection\u2014only rutinexhibited protective activity comparable to that of the extractsat 5\u00b5g/mL (Figure 2B; p > 0.05), and with TBARS test\u2014overlapped ranges of percentage inhibition of peroxidation werefound for the standards (ca. 26\u201332%) and the extracts (21\u201334%)at 5\u00b5g/mL (Figure 2C; p > 0.05).

In both tests thestrongest effects observed for EAF and DEF were intermediatebetween those of phenolic standards and indomethacin, a strongnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The inhibitory activitytoward both enzymes was strongly correlated with the TPC levels(|r| > 0.88, p < 0.05). The responses in the LOX test were alsostrongly TFC-dependent (r = \u22120.8868, p < 0.05), while in theHYAL assay this relationship was noticeable (r = \u22120.8691) butnot significant (p= 0.056).Influence on Cells ViabilityThe potential cytotoxicity of the extracts was evaluated in amodel of PBMCs after 60 and 120 min of incubation with theextracts at 5\u00b5g/mL. Cellular safety of the extracts was evidencedby the lack of significant differences (p > 0.05) in cell viabilityobserved between PBMCs incubated with the extracts (85.6\u201390.5% viability) and the control (untreated) samples (87.85\u201390.85viability), regardless of the incubation time and extraction solvent(Figure 3).DISCUSSIONAs beneficial for human health, including prevention of CVD,polyphenol-rich extracts are widely used in the preparation ofdietary supplements and pharmaceuticals (Franz et al., 2011).Extraction from natural matrices is thus the crucial step intheir utilization as it affects extract composition, activity, andyield. Generally, alcohol and alcohol-water mixtures are thebest extractants for low-molecular-weight polyphenols of highantioxidant potential and good bioavailability (Manach et al.,2005). The crude extracts are often fractionated to remove fat-soluble ballast substances (chlorophylls and waxes) and therebypurify and concentrate the phenolic fractions (Rana et al.,2016). The results from the present study confirmed theseobservations: the defatted methanol-water (7:3, v/v) extract fromthe blackthorn flowers (MED), demonstrated to be a rich sourceFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 680292Marchelak et al.

The TPC inthe richest fractions EAF and DEF, as determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) assay, were comparable to those found in theextracts considered important in CVD prevention, for instancein commercial ethanol extracts of grape seed (ca. 630\u2013670 mgGAE/g dw) (Baydara et al., 2004) or in ethyl acetate fractionsof green tea and green mate (ca. 480\u2013580 mg GAE/g dw) (Erolet al., 2009). The previous literature data referring to P. spinosaare limited to studies on fruits, branches, and leaves. Accordingto Pinacho et al. (2015), the highest TPC level quantified bythe Prussian Blue method (PB) was found for ethanol fractionfrom branches (732.34 mg GAE/g dw), followed by those fromfruits (359.11 mg GAE/g dw) and leaves (228.56 mg GAE/gdw). Despite some differences in chemistry of the PB assayin comparison to the standardized FC test, in the preliminarystudies focused on selection of the plant material for the presentwork, we have observed the magnitude of phenolic levels to someextent similar, which enables ordering of the blackthorn tissues inrespect to the TPC values as follows: branches > flowers > fruits\u2265 leaves. Therefore, the flowers were found promising for furtherstudies.The present paper is the first presenting comprehensive LC-MS profile of P. spinosa flowers (Figure 1, Table 1). The previousstudies aimed at isolation and resulted in structure elucidationof 16 flavonoids (Sakar and Kolodziej, 1993; Olszewska andWolbis\u00b4, 2001, 2002a) and five proanthocyanidins (Kolodziejet al., 1991), the presence of which was now confirmed inthe flower dry extracts. In addition, 36 constituents, mainlyflavonoids, and phenolic acids, were reported here for thefirst time for the blackthorn flowers (Table 1). With nearly60 components detected, in contrast to only 25 observed inthe leaves (Owczarek et al., 2017), 26 in branches (Pinachoet al., 2015), and 29 in fruits (Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2013), thephenolic matrix of the flowers is obviously the most complex.A distinctive qualitative feature of the flower extracts is a vastdiversity of the flavonoid fraction (thirty seven peaks). Whileaccording to Owczarek et al. (2017) flavonoids prevail also inthe leaf samples, only 14 structures have been detected in thisorgan. The branches and fruits of P. spinosa may be in turndistinguished by the presence of numerous proanthocyanidins(twelve peaks in branches) and anthocyanins (eight peaks infruits), respectively (Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2013; Pinacho et al., 2015).In phytotherapy, the blackthorn flowers are indeed recognized asa flavonoid herbal product (Hoppe, 1981; Poonam et al., 2011).High content of flavonoids found in the present study and theirprevalence in flower dry extracts (Table 2), were in agreementwith these findings. In addition to flavonoids, the analyzedextracts contained moderate levels of proanthocyanidins andphenolic acids (Table 2). The TPA level of MED is in accordancewith the results reported recently by Ropiak et al. (2016) foraqueous acetone extracts of blackthorn flowers (40 mg/g dw). Asindicated in the latter paper, the average degree of polymerizationof flower procyanidins is 2.9, which means that the majorityof TPA fraction is within the bioavailable range of molecularmasses (Manach et al., 2005). Thus, the composition of theflower extracts of blackthorn appears promising in the contextof CVD and potential industrial application. Regular intakeof flavonoids with the diet or supplements is associated withreduced risk of cardiovascular episodes and mortality (Alissaand Ferns, 2012). In in vivo studies, they have been shownto improve antioxidant status, exert anti-atherosclerotic andanti-atherothrombotic effects in early stages of atherosclerosisdevelopment (e.g., decrease LDL oxidation), modulate lipidmetabolism (e.g., normalize LDL/HDL profile), improve capillarypermeability (vasoprotective effects) and endothelial function,and increase nitric oxide release (vasodilatory effects) (Middletonet al., 2000; Alissa and Ferns, 2012). As the most commongroup of polyphenols in the human diet, flavonoids are alsoregarded as safe in internal applications. Like flavonoids, bothlow-molecular-mass proanthocyanidins and phenolic acids havebeen shown to modulate lipid metabolism, increase plasmaantioxidant capacity, improve vascular functions, and reduceplatelet activity in humans (Manach et al., 2005).As antioxidant activity of polyphenols is one of the mostimportant aspects of their beneficial effects in CVD (Middletonet al., 2000; Alissa and Ferns, 2012; Qui\u00f1ones et al., 2013;Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 680293Marchelak et al. Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower ExtractsSantilli et al., 2015) we decided to verify it in complementarychemical and biological models that reflect various direct andcomplex mechanisms. Although simple chemical in vitro assaysare hardly relevant to in vivo conditions, they enable preliminaryscreening for potential mechanisms and comparison with theliterature data. In the present study, we employed three the mostfrequently used tests of both single electron transfer (DPPH,FRAP) and hydrogen atom transfer basic mechanisms (TBARS)to explore direct interactions of the extracts with free-radicalsand transition metal ions as well as to study some of these effectsin a model of lipid peroxidation. The results demonstrated thatthe flower extracts are potent and universal antioxidants, andthat their dose-dependent activity is determined by the contentsof phenolics, primarily flavonoids, and strongly influencedby the fractionation solvent (Tables 3, 4). Also the extractsproduced from other organs of P. spinosa have recently beenreported effective DPPH scavengers, as well as inhibitors oflipid peroxidation (Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2014; Pinacho et al., 2015).Comparing our results to those of Pinacho et al. (2015) and interms of capacity of BHA after 60 min of incubation, it seems thatthe activity of flower extracts (EAF, DEF) is comparable to that ofbranches, and superior to those of leaves and fruits. Moreover,the comparison of our results from TBARS assay and the resultsobtained by Guimar\u00e3es et al. (2014) in terms of activity of Trolox,shows that the lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity of flowerextracts (EAF, DEF) is higher than that of phenolic-enrichedextracts from wild fruits. On the other hand, the outcomes fromDPPH test suggest similar scavenging activity for flower and fruitextracts.To give a more accurate approximation of the possible invivo effects of the flower extracts, we extended the in vitrostudy to the model of human plasma exposed to oxidativestress. The stress conditions were induced by peroxynitrite(ONOO\u2212), a powerful oxidative and nitrative species, generatedin vivo by the reaction of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxideanion (O\u2022\u22122 ), and involved in the pathophysiology of variousinflammatory, neurodegenerative, and especially cardiovasculardisorders including atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction andchronic heart failure (Ronson et al., 1999). The concentration ofONOO\u2212 used in our in vitro study (100\u00b5M) enables quantitativemeasurements of the changes induced in plasma componentsand corresponds to its levels in vivo, that can be reached inlocal compartments in the conditions of accelerated productionof NO and O\u2022\u22122 , e.g., during a serious inflammation of bloodvessels, when its synthesis can increase up to 50\u2013100 \u00b5M/min(Szabo et al., 2007). During the study, the plasma samples werepre-incubated with the extracts at the levels of 1\u201350\u00b5g/mL,equivalent to 0.06\u201329.2 \u00b5g GAE/mL, depending on the extract.From the physiological point of view, the concentrations ofphenolic substances that are likely to occur in blood plasmain vivo after oral supplementation can reach up to 5\u20137 \u00b5M,depending on the foodmatrix (Manach et al., 2005). For example,it has been reported that 100-mg dose of quercetin from onionsand 150-mg dose of pure isoquercitrin (quercetin-3-glucoside)resulted in the concentrations up to 7.6 and 5 \u00b5M in plasma,respectively, which is an equivalent of 1.5\u20132.3\u00b5g/mL of quercetin(Hollmann, 2004; Manach et al., 2005). It has also been suggestedthat the bioavailability of kaempferol and its glycosides, thedominant flavonoids of blackthorn flowers according to ourresults, is higher than that of quercetin (DuPont et al., 2004).Therefore, the lower levels of the extracts (1\u20135\u00b5g/mL) used in thestudy appear to closely correspond to the range of physiologicallevel of plant-derived phenolic compounds available after oraladministration. In accordance with the common practice of invitro studies (Kolodziejczyk et al., 2011; Kolodziejczyk-Czepaset al., 2013, 2014), the extracts were studied also at 50\u00b5g/mLto enable that of observation of all possible effects of theirinteraction with peroxynitrite.The results from biological model confirmed our hypothesisthat antioxidant activity of the P. spinosa flower extracts may becrucial in understanding their beneficial effects in CVD in vivo.The analyzed extracts not only enhanced the total antioxidantstatus of the ONOO\u2212-treated plasma but also effectively reducedthe levels of well-known oxidative stress biomarkers\u2014productsof protein nitration (3-nitrotyrosine) and lipid peroxidation(hydroperoxides and TBARS) (Figure 3). In CVD patients, theincreased levels of these biomarkers are good predictors ofcardiovascular events and are correlated with prothrombotic,proatherogenic, and pro-inflammatory intravascular effects,plaque instability, and endothelial dysfunctions (Lee et al., 2012;Thomson, 2015). The mechanism of action of the blackthornextracts in the protection of plasma proteins and lipids probablyinvolves a direct scavenging of peroxynitrite or/and secondaryradicals formed in the induced chain reactions. It is consistentwith the noticeable scavenging potential of the extracts towardthe model radical (DPPH), and with the accumulating evidenceof anti-radical effects of polyphenols against ONOO\u2212 andONOO\u2212-related radicals operating in plasma, such as O\u2022\u22122 , NO,\u2022NO2,\u2022OH, etc. (Heijnen et al., 2001). Despite some argumentsbeing presented for the impact of blackthorn polyphenolson the target activity in plasma, the differences between theexamined extracts were not as evident as in the case of chemicaltests. The discrepancies may be an effect of complexity andontogenetic diversity of blood plasma, as well as differencesin the sensitivity to ONOO\u2212 between the plasma samples.Some interactions between endogenous plasma constituents andblackthorn phenolics could also be the reason. On the otherhand, the complexity of the extracts and synergic effects of theirindividual components are probably behind the superior activityprofile revealed by the extracts comparing to the pure standards.Finally, it is of note that all beneficial effects of the extractson plasma were measurable at physiological concentrations (1\u20135\u00b5g/mL), which do not deteriorate the viability of PBMCs andmay be regarded as safe.Pathogenesis of CVD covers, apart from oxidative stress,also a closely related process of inflammation (Biswas, 2016).To evaluate the potential anti-inflammatory effects of theblackthorn extracts, we decided to study their impact on twomodel pro-inflammatory enzymes. The first belongs to thefamily of lipoxygenases, enzymes catalyzing dioxygenation ofpolyenoic fatty acids in biological membranes and lipoproteins,and producing key chemokines and ROS, such as leukotrienesand O\u2022\u22122 , associated with the development of oxidativestress-related inflammatory pathologies of CVD, e.g., myocardialinfarction/reperfusion injury (Schneider and Bucar, 2005).

Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower Extractstissues (i.a. vascular) permeability during the inflammatoryprocesses by degrading hyaluronan, an anti-inflammatoryextracellular matrix component (Girish et al., 2009). Bothenzymes are targets of many synthetic drugs used in anti-inflammatory therapies, but it has been shown that plant extracts,especially those containing phenolics, can also significantlyinhibit their activity (Schneider and Bucar, 2005; Piwowarskiet al., 2011). Indeed, the investigated extracts, rich in polyphenols,were found to be inhibitors of both enzymes (Table 5).The activity of the most active fractions was between thoseof the commercial agents\u2014indomethacin (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and rutin (flavonoid vasoprotective agent),while the basic methanol-water extract was slightly lessactive. However, with the results of antioxidant activity tests,these findings suggest that the extracts might influence bothinterdependent processes of oxidative stress and inflammation.CONCLUSIONSThis work is the first comprehensive phytochemical and activitystudy of the flower extracts of P. spinosa. The detailed LC-MSpatterns presented here can be recommended as referencefingerprints useful in authentication and standardizationstudies of blackthorn flowers and flower extracts. Distinctphenolic profiles, significant antioxidant effects comparable toor surpassing the activity of pure phenolics in both chemicaland biological models, noticeable inhibitory effects on pro-inflammatory enzymes, and cellular safety suggest thatthe investigated extracts may be promising candidates forthe production of pharma- and nutraceuticals effective incardiovascular protection. Considering both the yield and theactivity, the defatted methanol-water (7:3, v/v) extract andits diethyl ether and ethyl acetate fractions appear to be themost advantageous for biological applications. As the observedcapacities might be considered as some of the mechanismsbehind the activity of blackthorn phenolics within the circulatorysystem, the present study forms a basis for their further studiesin the context of CVD. For instance, the demonstrated protectiveeffects of the extracts against ONOO\u2212-induced changes inplasma components and ability to inhibit pro-inflammatoryenzymes might be cross-linked with their possible anti-atherogenic, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet functions or abilityto influence endothelium, which should be addressed in futureresearch.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAM, AO, and MO planned the experiments and wrote themanuscript.

Mandal1*1 Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Rajasthan, Ajmer, India, 2 Department ofBiochemistry, University of Delhi, New Delhi, IndiaModern treatment strategies provide better overall survival in cancer patients, primarilyby controlling tumor growth. However, off-target and systemic toxicity, tumor recurrence,and resistance to therapy are still inadvertent hurdles in current treatment regimens.Similarly, metastasis is another deadly threat to patients suffering from cancer. This hascreated an urgent demand to come up with new drugs having anti-metastatic potentialand minimum side effects. Thus, this study was aimed at exploring the anti-proliferativeand anti-metastatic potential of colocynth medicinal plant. Results from MTT assay,morphological visualization of cells and scratch assay indicated a role of ethanol andacetone extracts of fruit pulp of the colocynth plant in inhibiting cell viability, enhancingcell cytotoxicity and preventing cell migration in various cancer cell types, includingbreast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and cervical cancer cell line SiHa,subsequently having a low cytotoxic effect on mononuclear PBMC and macrophageJ774A cells. Our study in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells showed that both ethanol andacetone pulp extracts decreased transcript levels of the anti-apoptotic genes BCL2and BCLXL, and a reverse effect was observed for the pro-apoptotic genes BAX andcaspase 3. Additionally, enhanced caspase 3 activity and downregulated BCL2 proteinwere seen, indicating a role of these extracts in inducing apoptotic activity. Moreover,MDA-MB-231 cells treated with both these extracts demonstrated up-regulation of theepithelial gene keratin 19 and down-regulation of the mesenchymal genes, vimentin,N-cadherin, Zeb1 and Zeb2 compared to control, suggesting a suppressive impact ofthese extracts in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, these extractsinhibited colony and sphere formation with simultaneous reduction in the transcriptlevel of the stemness associated genes, BMI-1 and CD44. It was also found thatboth the plant extracts exhibited synergistic potential with the chemotherapeutic drugdoxorubicin to inhibit cancer viability. Furthermore, GC-MS/MS analysis revealed thepresence of certain novel compounds in both the extracts that are responsible for theanti-cancer role of the extracts. Overall, the results of this report suggest, for the firsttime, that colocynth fruit pulp extracts may block the proliferative as well as metastaticactivity of breast cancer cells.Keywords: cancer, colocynth, cell death, apoptosis, cell viability, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, metastasisFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593297fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 2Chowdhury et al. Colocynth Extracts: EMT and StemnessINTRODUCTIONCancer constitutes a group of deadly diseases that is not onlythe second leading cause of death worldwide, but also largelycontributes to the global health economic burden. The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) has estimated over 14.1 millioncancer cases and 8.2 million cancer-induced deaths worldwidein 2012, and this number is expected to rise catastrophicallyin the coming decades (Torre et al., 2015). Breast and cervicalcancers are the most frequently diagnosed cancers in femalesnationwide, accounting for about 1.7 million new cases and521,900 breast cancer deaths in 2008 (Torre et al., 2015). Indiainfamously boasts of a surmounting 27 and 23% breast andcervical cancer incidence respectively1. Cervical cancer is thesecond most diagnosed cancer and third leading cause of deathsin females, accounting for about 527600 new cases and 265700deaths (Torre et al., 2015).Cancer is predominantly caused due to abnormalities in thegenome (Balmain et al., 2003) and epigenome (Feinberg andTycko, 2004) due to exposure to various damaging agents. Thisset of accumulated cells that has escaped the normal regulatorycontrol mechanisms undergoes unchecked proliferation toform tumors. Despite several advancements in recent years,contemporary anticancer therapy suffers from several limitationsowing to their associated toxicity and off-target effects. Thisprovokes an urgent need to design novel drugs with high efficacyspecific for cancer cells and less toxicity to off-target cells.Phytochemicals have shown promise in this regard as they fitthe above criteria, and their usage in anticancer therapy is anemerging trend.Citrullus colocynth (L.) is a valuable cucurbit plant, widelydistributed in the desert areas of the world, including India,known to possess nutritional values and diverse medicinalactivities, including antibacterial, antifungal, larvicidal andanti-inflammatory properties (Sawaya et al., 1986; Marzouk et al.,2010; Chawech et al., 2017). Literature documents the presenceof many bioactive compounds, such as cucurbitacin, phenolicacids, flavonoids, pyridine and quinolone type alkaloids andfatty acids in fruits of these herbal plants (Hussain et al., 2013,2014; Jeon and Lee, 2014). This plant is traditionally used tocontrol diabetes (Shi et al., 2014). Recent clinical trial studies havewitnessed a fall in fasting blood glucose and Hb1Ac, triglycerideand cholesterol in case of colocynth users (Rahbar and Nabipour,2010; Barghamdi et al., 2016). Intriguingly, a study by Tannin-Spitz et al. (2007) documented cancer specific apoptotic activityof the isolate cucurbitacin, extracted from this plant. However,no study has yet been conducted to explore the effect of colocynthextract in cancer metastasis. Thus, this study was primarily aimedat investigating the unexplored anti-metastatic potential of thisplant extract.This study testified that ethanol and acetone fruit pulpextracts exhibited impressive inhibition of cell viability andcell migration of various cancer cell types, including breastand cervical cancer cells with considerably less effect onmononuclear cells and macrophage cells. Moreover, these pulp1breastcancerindia.netextracts noticeably hindered colony and sphere formationand epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of metastaticbreast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Our GC-MS analysis alsoreveals some unique compounds, which may account for theanticancer activity of the extracts. The current study is thefirst report advocating that fruit pulp extracts containing thenovel compounds may have anti-metastatic potential along withapoptotic activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsVerso cDNA synthesis kit (AB1453A, Thermo Scientific), TRIzolReagent (T9424, Sigma Aldrich), Taq Polymerase (MBT060A,Himedia), ready Mix dNTP (MBT078, Himedia), caspase-3antibody (#9661, Cell signaling), BCL-2 antibody (SC-7382,Santa Cruz Technology), actin antibody (A02066, SigmaAldrich), WesternSure-Premium Chemiluminescent substrate(WesternSure-Li-COR-Part No: 926-95000).Cell LinesThe human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 (metastatic) and MCF-7(non-metastatic) cell lines, and cervical cancer SiHa cell linewere procured from NCCS cell repository, Pune, India. J774Acell (Macrophage cell line) was obtained from Dr. Vijay KumarPrajapati, Department of Biochemistry, Central University ofRajasthan, India.

Thetaxonomic name of this plant had been confirmed by Dr. AmitFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593298fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 3Chowdhury et al. Colocynth Extracts: EMT and StemnessKotia, Department of Botany, University of Rajasthan, India. Thepulp was isolated from fruits, dried and crushed, using a mixergrinder. One gram of dried pulp powder was suspended in 10 mlof ethanol and acetone, followed by solvent extraction at 50\u25e6Cfor 72 h. The solvent fractions were evaporated using a rotary-evaporator at 42\u25e6C to get the crude products. The crude extractsobtained were then dissolved in ethanol and acetone and kept at\u221220\u25e6C for further use.MTT Cell Viability AssayCell viability was measured by MTT assay (MB186, Himedia)described earlier (Ghosh-Choudhury et al., 2010; Mehta et al.,2015). In brief, cancer cells (5000 cells/well) were seeded in 96well tissue culture plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBSat an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u25e6C. After 24 h of seeding,cells were separately incubated with different concentrations[25, 100, and 250 \u00b5g/ml; equivalent to 1, 4, and 10 \u00b5l ofsolvents (ethanol/acetone)] of fruit pulp ethanol extract (PEE)and pulp acetone extract (PAE) for 24 h. Control cells weresimilarly incubated with equal volume of the solvents as in theexperimental wells. At the end of the incubation period, 10 \u00b5l ofMTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and the platewas incubated at 37\u25e6C for 1 h. The formazan crystals formedwere solubilized by adding DMSO, and subsequently, absorbancewas measured at a wavelength of 530 nm (Studzinski, 1995;Moongkarndi et al., 2004; Ghosh-Choudhury et al., 2010; Mehtaet al., 2015). The effective absorbance was calculated for theexperimental wells with respect to corresponding control wells.LC50 (Lethal concentration at which 50% cells are killed) at 24 hduration was calculated using MTT data set for different cancercell lines (Zhang et al., 2007).Scratch AssayCell migration was determined by scratch assay as describedearlier (Mandal et al., 2010b, 2011b). In brief, cells (2 \u00d7 105cells/plate) were seeded in 35 mm tissue culture plates andallowed to grow till they reach 95% confluency. A cell scratch-wound was generated using a micropipette tip, and washed oncewith PBS buffer to remove the floating cells. Cells were thenseparately treated with PEE and PAE (25 \u00b5g/ml) for 24 h inexperimental plates, and equal volume of respective solventswas added in control plates. Cells were visualized under aninverted microscope (Carl-Zeiss), and cell migration was assessedby measuring gap sizes in multiple fields and the relative areacalculated using ImageJ, and statistically analyzed (Hirsch et al.,2009).RT-PCR AnalysisTranscript levels of several genes were measured bysemi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis as described previously(Mandal et al., 2010a; Chowdhury et al., 2017). In brief, breastcancer cells (2 \u00d7 105 cells/plate) were plated in 35 mm tissueculture plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at anatmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u25e6C. After 90-100% cell confluencyis reached, the cells were treated with different test factors(such as PEE and PAE (50 \u00b5g/ml)) for 24 h. Total RNA wasextracted using TRIzol reagent as described earlier (Mandalet al., 2010a, 2011a, 2016a; Ghosh-Choudhury et al., 2013). Firststand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 \u00b5g of total RNAsusing the Verso cDNA synthesis kit, according to manufacturer\u2019sinstruction. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed using thiscDNA as template and gene specific primers in a ProFlex PCRsystem (Applied Biosystem by Life Technologies). The list ofprimers used in this study is given in Supplementary Table S1.Densitometric analysis of the PCR bands was done usingScnImage (Chowdhury et al., 2017).Western Blot AnalysisMethodology of western blotting has been described previously(Chowdhury et al., 2017). In brief, cells were seeded at a densityof 2 \u00d7 105 cells/plate in 35 mm tissue culture plates. Cells weretreated with different test factors and harvested after 24 h oftreatment. Protein extraction was carried out in RIPA buffer andsubsequently, cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u25e6Cfor 20 min. The protein concentration was measured by Bradfordreagent (BIORAD), according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction.Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by 12%SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. This PVDFmembrane was incubated with primary antibody (Anti-caspase-3antibody (#9661, Cell signaling), Anti-BCL-2 antibody (SC-7382,Santa Cruz Technology), Anti-actin antibody (A02066, SigmaAldrich) used at 1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4\u25e6C. Afterwashing, the PVDF membrane was further incubated withHRP-conjugated secondary antibody (used at 1:10000 dilution)for 1 h at room temperature. The washed membrane was furtherincubated with chemiluminescent substrate and subsequently,the blot was scanned by C-DIGIT Blot Scanner (Li-COR-Model:3600).Colony Formation AssayCells were seeded at a density of 500 cells/well in a 12 well tissueculture plate in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37\u25e6C incubator with5% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were then treated with PEE and PAEextracts (25 \u00b5g/ml), and incubated under same conditions for5 days. Next, colonies were fixed with methanol and were stainedwith crystal violet solution (Hirsch et al., 2009). Photographsof stained plate were taken by a camera. Photographs ofcolonies were also taken by a bright field inverted microscope(Carl-Zeiss).Soft Agar Sphere Formation AssayFor performing soft agar assay (Sebolt-Leopold et al., 1999),MDA-MB-231 cells (10,000 cells/plate) were mixed with 2XDMEM containing 0.6% (w/v) agar and layered with 2X DMEMcontaining 1.2% base agar medium in 35 mm culture plates.25 \u00b5g/ml of PEE and PAE was added in 300 \u00b5l of DMEM to thetop agar and cells were allowed to grow for 8 days. The top 300 \u00b5lmedium was replaced with fresh medium with or without testfactors at intervals of every 3 days. The morphology and size ofthe spheres were visualized using bright field inverted microscope(Carl-Zeiss) and photographed. Subsequently, spheres weremanually counted under the microscope.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593299fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 4Chowdhury et al.

For this, different cancer cells,including breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231,and cervical cancer cell line, SiHa, were separately treated withincreasing concentrations (range 25\u2013250 \u00b5g/ml) of PEE andPAE for 24 h (Figures 1A\u2013C, 2A\u2013C). MTT assay result showednoteworthy reduction in the number of viable cells in a dosedependent manner for both PEE and PAE treatment whencompared to their respective solvent controls. To determine theeffectiveness of the pulp extracts in these cancer cells, LC50 values(using MTT data) were also calculated. In case of ethanol extract,LC50 (\u00b5g /ml) values were 142\u00b1 16, 105\u00b1 8.3 and 157\u00b1 4.3 forMDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and SiHa cell lines respectively (Table 1).For acetone extract, these values were 140 \u00b1 0.8, 94 \u00b1 6.4and 121 \u00b1 4.6 respectively. These findings indicated relativelyhigher efficacy of PAE in cancer cell lines compared to PEE.Moreover, MCF-7 cells showed higher sensitivity to both PAEand PEE as compared to MDA-MB-231 cells. LC50 values of boththe extracts in PBMC and J774A cell line were >300 \u00b5g /ml(Table 1). Furthermore, microscopic visualization indicated acytotoxic effect of the extracts upon these cancer cell lines(Figures 1D\u2013F, 2D\u2013F). All these findings suggested that thefruit pulp extracts induced reduced viability of cells that ispresumably caused by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducingcytotoxicity.To examine the influence of these pulp extracts on cellapoptosis, RT-PCR analysis was performed to compare thetranscript levels of anti-apoptotic BCL2 and BCLXL andapoptotic BAX genes, using total RNA of MDA-MB-231Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593300fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 5Chowdhury et al.

Both PEE and PAE considerably impededBCL2 and BCLXL expression with simultaneous upsurge inBAX expression (Figures 3A\u2013D and Supplementary FiguresS1A\u2013C,E\u2013G). Moreover, expression of apoptotic caspase 3gene was augmented upon treatment with both PAE andPEE (Figures 3E,F and Supplementary Figures S1D,H).Furthermore, western blot results demonstrated increasedlevel of cleaved caspase 3 (Figures 3G,H) with a concomitantdecrease in the protein level of anti-apoptotic gene BCL2(Figures 3I,J) for both ethanol and acetone extract treated cellscompared to control. These observations led us to proposean apoptotic activity of fruit pulp extracts in breast cancercells.Inhibitory Effect of Colocynth PulpExtracts on Cancer Cell MigrationA common problem faced by a large percentage of cancer patientsis development of metastasis if cancers are not detected inearly and/or not treated with a suitable therapy. Migration ofcancer cells is a critical step in the metastatic cascade (Chafferand Weinberg, 2011). Thus, we investigated the effect of pulpethanol and acetone extracts on the migratory property ofcancer cells by performing scratch assay. Scratches were madeon cell monolayer by a small pipet tip, and subsequently, cellswere incubated with or without pulp extracts. Microscopicphotos indicated migration of cells to close the induced scratchafter 24 h in control MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and SiHa cells(Figures 4A\u2013C, 5A\u2013C). Cells treated with both ethanol andacetone extracts (25 \u00b5g/ml) showed substantial prevention ofcell migration as evident from the unfilled gap areas betweenthe two ends of the scratches that were larger in cases ofpulp extracts as compared to control. The data displayed inFigures 4D\u2013F, 5D\u2013F denoted a significant inhibition of cellmigration in response to treatment with both ethanol and acetoneextracts.Effect of Colocynth Pulp Extracts onEMTTransition from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype is a criticalstep for metastasis (Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011). To examine theeffect of fruit pulp extracts on prevention of EMT of metastaticMDA-MB-231 cells, we analyzed mRNA levels of several EMTmarkers by RT-PCR. Interestingly, we observed a decline inexpression of mesenchymal markers, Vimentin and N-cadherin,with a concurrent increase in the expression of epithelial markerFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593301fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 6Chowdhury et al.

Here, GAPDH was used as an internal loading control. Densitometric analysis data are given in Supplementary Figure S1. (G,H) Level of cleavedcaspase 3 and (I,J) BCL-2 was measured by western blotting using equal amount of cellular protein isolated from cells with or without treatment with PEE or PAE.B-actin serves as an internal loading control.keratin-19 in treated samples (Figures 6A,B and SupplementaryFigures S2A\u2013C,F\u2013H). Moreover, both PEE and PAE treatmentstrongly inhibited expression of the mesenchymal phenotypeinducing transcription factors, Zeb1 and Zeb2 (Figures 6A,Band Supplementary Figures S2D,E,I,J). These observations clearlyindicate a restraining impact of these pulp extracts on EMT ofbreast cancer cells.Colocynth Pulp Extracts InhibitedStemness Property of Breast CancerCellsAccumulating evidences suggest that cancers develop fromcancer initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs) (Reya et al.,2001; Singh and Settleman, 2010). Although CSCs comprise ofa small percentage of the tumor population, their resistanceto contemporary chemo- and radiation- therapy is a leadingcause for tumor recurrence and metastasis (Li et al., 2007;Singh and Settleman, 2010). Thus, we investigated the effect ofcolocynth pulp extracts on the stemness property of metastaticMDA-MB-231 cells by colony formation assay. In agreementwith previous observations, the number of colony formed wasmarkedly reduced when cells were treated with pulp extracts(25 \u00b5g/ml) as compared to control, indicating an inhibitoryrole of both PEE and PAE on cancer stemness (Figures 7A\u2013D).To further support these results, we carried out soft agarsphere formation assay. Microscopic visualization documentedformation of a great number of spheres with large size after8 days of cell culture in the control plates. The numberas well as the size of such spheres was, however, greatlydiminished when cells were incubated with both PAE and PEE(25 \u00b5g/ml) as compared to control (Figures 8A\u2013D). Theseresults show that fruit pulp extracts might attenuate stemnessproperty of cancer cells. To verify these findings, we furtherexamined the effect of these pulp extracts on the expression ofstemness associated genes CD44 and BMI-1. RT-PCR analysisdocumented that transcript levels of both CD44 and BMI-1 genes (Al-Hajj et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2006) were significantlyFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593302fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 7Chowdhury et al.

However, surgical removal,radiation-, chemo-, endocrine-, and other targeted- therapiesare continuously being improvised to improve the overallsurvival and quality of life of cancer patients. Althoughmodern treatment modalities are capable of taking care ofthe primary tumors, tumor recurrence and metastasis are themajor limitations in the limelight at present. Furthermore,2breastcancerindia.netchemotherapeutic drugs often show significant off-target effectsalong with systemic toxicity, such as cardiovascular, liver andnephrotoxicity (King and Perry, 2001; Schimmel et al., 2004).Thus, finding novel anticancer drugs, which prevent both tumorgrowth and metastasis while circumventing the known sideeffects, is an active area of research. In this area, applicationof natural products like secondary metabolites with effectivetumor suppressive ability has shown promise in recent yearsas they are found to be effective even at sufficiently lowerFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593304fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 9Chowdhury et al. Colocynth Extracts: EMT and StemnessFIGURE 8 | Inhibitory activity of colocynth pulp extract on spheroid formation and stemness of breast cancer cell. (A) Soft agar assay was performed onMDA-MB-231 cells by treating cells with pulp ethanol extract (PEE; A,C) and pulp acetone extract (PAE; B,D) and allowing cells to grow for 8 days. Spheroidcolonies were visualized by inverted bright field microscope (A,B). Number of spheroids of all plates was counted and analyzed with respect to control plates (C,D),in (C) \u2217\u2217p < 0.01; PEE vs. control (ethanol) after 8 days, and in (D) \u2217\u2217p < 0.01; PAE vs. control (acetone) after 8 days.

GAPDH was used as an internal loading control. Densitometric data is given in Supplementary Figure S3.doses and due to their safety profile (Koehn and Carter,2005).Thus, this study was aimed at exploring the anti-cancerproperties of extracts from Citrullus colocynth plant of thecucurbitaceae family that has been used as a traditional medicineto control diabetes (Zaini et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2014). Reportsabout the nutritional and medicinal values of this plant andpresence of many bioactive molecules had initially attracted ourattention (Sawaya et al., 1983, 1986; Asyaz et al., 2010; Marzouket al., 2010; Hussain et al., 2013, 2014; Jeon and Lee, 2014;Chawech et al., 2017). Moreover, Tannin-Spitz et al. (2007)found that an isolate (cucurbitacin glucosides) extracted fromthe leaves of this plant exhibits apoptotic activity in cancer cells.Nevertheless, no detailed study was done regarding the anti-cancer effects of this plant extract. Our study found that bothethanol and acetone extracts of fruit pulp of the colocynth plantshowed a significant inhibition of cell viability of various cancercell lines, including breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231,and cervical cancer SiHa cell lines (Figures 1, 2 and Table 1).Correspondingly, both extracts had reverse cytotoxic effect onmononuclear cells PBMC and macrophage cell line J774A. Breastcancer MCF-7 cells showed more sensitivity to both ethanoland acetone pulp extracts as compared to other cancer cells.This was in agreement with previous reports that too claimhigher sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to colocynth fruit extract atrelatively lower concentrations (Mukherjee and Patil, 2012). Theprobable explanation may be either use of alkaloid rich extractsor longer exposure in MCF-7 cells (Mukherjee and Patil, 2012).Our study also found that both ethanol and acetone extractsexhibited synergistic potential with the chemotherapeutic drugdoxorubicin to inhibit viability in the breast cancer cells(Supplementary Figure S4).Moreover, on molecular analysis, we found suppression oftranscripts of anti-apoptotic genes BCL2 and BCLXL, and aninduction of apoptotic gene BAX and caspase 3 mRNA inmetastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells following treatmentwith ethanol and acetone pulp extracts (Figure 3). In addition,these pulp extracts displayed a higher level of cleaved caspase3 protein and a lower level of BCL-2 protein as compared tocontrol, implying an enhancement of active caspase 3 upontreatment with these extracts (Figure 3). Thus, this studyindicated that colocynth fruit pulp extracts exhibit an anticancerpotential presumably by promoting apoptosis.As stated earlier, metastasis remains one of the major threatsto cancer patients. However, no study has yet been conductedto investigate the anti-metastatic potential of this plant extract.Our study indicated, for the first time, a preventive role ofthese pulp extracts in cancer cell migration, a key step in themetastatic process (Figures 4, 5) (Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011).These pulp extracts also block EMT (Chaffer and Weinberg,2011), another vital step in the metastatic cascade, since bothPEE and PAE treatment significantly enhanced epithelial geneexpression with simultaneous inhibition of mesenchymal markerexpression in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6).Additionally, treatment of cancer cells with these ethanol andacetone pulp extracts showed a noticeable reduction in colonyand sphere formation with concomitant inhibition of cancerstemness associated genes CD44 and BMI-1 at their transcriptlevels, suggesting a preventive role of these pulp extractsin cancer stemness (Monteiro and Fodde, 2010), a pivotalproperty responsible for metastasis, therapy resistance and tumorrecurrence (Figures 7, 8).All these findings summarized a role of the ethanol andacetone fruit pulp extracts of colocynth in prevention of cellproliferation, induction of cell apoptosis, prevention of cellmigration, reduction of EMT, and inhibition of cancer stemnessproperty in breast cancer cells.However, further study is required to identify the bioactivemolecule(s) present in fruit pulp, liable for the observedanticancer potential.

Falcarindiol (3\u201320 \u00b5M) increased cholesterol efflux from THP-1-derivedmacrophages. Western blot analysis showed an increased protein level of ABCA1upon falcarindiol exposure. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that also ABCA1 mRNAlevel rise with falcarindiol (10 \u00b5M) treatment. The effect of falcarindiol on ABCA1protein as well as mRNA level were counteracted by co-treatment with BADGE, anantagonist of PPAR\u03b3. Furthermore, falcarindiol significantly inhibited ABCA1 proteindegradation in the presence of cycloheximide. This post-translational regulation ofABCA1 by falcarindiol occurs most likely by inhibition of lysosomal cathepsins, resultingin decreased proteolysis and extended protein half-life of ABCA1. Taken together,falcarindiol increases ABCA1 protein level by two complementary mechanisms, i.e.,promoting ABCA1 gene expression and inhibiting ABCA1 protein degradation, whichlead to enhanced cholesterol efflux.Keywords: falcarindiol, cholesterol efflux, ABCA1, protein degradation, PPAR\u03b3INTRODUCTIONCardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with atherosclerosis is a leading cause of mortality inthe world. Cholesterol metabolism has been considered as a major player in the pathogenesis ofCVD. Excessive cholesterol deposition resulting in plaques is a critical cause of atherosclerosis.Reverse cholesterol transport (RTC) is a complex multi-step process overall resulting in therelocation of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion into the bile andultimately the feces. Cholesterol e\ufb04ux, the initial step of RTC, is known to enhance the exportof excessive cholesterol from peripheral tissues, in particular macrophages, and thereby toinhibit the accumulation of cholesterol in the wall of arteries (Fielding and Fielding, 1995).There is strong evidence that the cholesterol e\ufb04ux capacity is inversely associated with the310Wang et al. Falcarindiol Promotes Cholesterol EffluxGraphical Abstract: The dietary constituent falcarindiol promotes macrophage cholesterol efflux by increasing ABCA1 transporter gene transcription (via PPAR\u03b3activation) and protein stability (via inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis).incidence of CVD (Rohatgi et al., 2014). Therefore, theenhancement of cholesterol e\ufb04ux from macrophages mightprevent CVD, making it a potential strategy for pharmacologicalinterventions. Key determinant of cholesterol e\ufb04ux is theexpression level and activity of transmembrane transporterproteins such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1(ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) and the scavenger receptor classB member 1 (SR-B1) (Duffy and Rader, 2006). Among them,ABCA1 is the predominant one and it contributes to most of thecholesterol transport in macrophages (Rosenson et al., 2012; Duet al., 2015). ABCA1 mediates mostly transfer of cholesterol tolipid\u2013poor apolipoprotein A1 (apo A1), but it can also mediatecholesterol transport using high density lipoproteins (HDL) asan acceptor (Du et al., 2015). Modulation of the ABCA1 proteinlevel is considered an important regulator for cholesterol e\ufb04ux.In general, the level of ABCA1 protein is determined by denovo synthesis and protein degradation. Several nuclear receptorsare implicated in the regulation of ABCA1 gene transcription.Thus, the activation of the ligand-dependent nuclear receptorsperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) andsubsequently the liver X receptor (LXR), can lead to increasedABCA1 gene transcription (Chawla et al., 2001; Chinetti et al.,2001; Ozasa et al., 2011). The ABCA1 protein half-life is largelyregulated via the proteolytic activity of calpain-, lysosome-, andubiquitin-degradation pathways (Wang et al., 2003;Mizuno et al.,2011; Liu and Tang, 2012; Yokoyama et al., 2012). Cathepsinsrepresent key lysosomal proteases (Turk et al., 2012) and diversecathepsin isoforms (e.g., cathepsin B, D, K, L, S) are known tobe expressed in macrophages (Punturieri et al., 2000; Beers et al.,2003; Bracke et al., 2005; Vasiljeva et al., 2006).Natural products have proven to be an excellent source ofmolecules with promising pharmacological activities and novelmechanisms of action (Atanasov et al., 2015). Here, we reportthe identification and characterization of the natural productfalcarindiol (Figure 1A) as a novel enhancer of macrophagecholesterol e\ufb04ux. Falcarindiol is a C(17)-polyacetylene and atypical constituent of roots and rhizomes of Apiaceae plantsused worldwide, including in Europe, such as the commonlyused vegetables and herbs carrot (Daucus carota L.) (Garrodet al., 1978), celery (Apium graveolens L.) (Zidorn et al., 2005),Notopterygium incisum K.C.Ting ex H.T.Chang (Zschocke et al.,1997), and Aegopodium podagraria L. (Kemp, 1978), amongothers. Taking the important role of PPAR\u03b3 in the regulationof macrophage cholesterol e\ufb04ux into consideration, we havechosen this natural product as a study subject in the contextof cholesterol e\ufb04ux because falcarindiol, extracted from therhizomes and roots of Notopterygium incisum K.C.Ting exH.T.Chang, was recently identified as a partial PPAR\u03b3 agonistin HEK-293 cells transfected with a PPAR\u03b3-responsive luciferasereporter (Atanasov et al., 2013).MATERIALS AND METHODSChemical ReagentsRoswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI-1640) mediumwas obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland).

The assay was performed as previouslydescribed (Wang et al., 2015) by quantification of the conversionof the low fluorescent resazurin to high fluorescent resorufin.Gel Electrophoresis and ImmunoblotAnalysisTHP-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and differentiated intomacrophages with 200 nM PMA for 72 h. The macrophageswere treated with the indicated compounds at the correspondingtime points, as described in detail in each figure legend.Cellular proteins were extracted using NP40 buffer (150mM NaCl; 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4); 1% NP40; 1% proteaseinhibitor CompleteTM (Roche); 1% phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF); 0.5% Na3VO4; 0.5% NaF) and quantifiedwith the Bradford method. For western blot analysis, an equalamount of protein (20 \u00b5g) was separated via SDS-PAGE andtransferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane wasblocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% non-fat milk,and then incubated at 4\u25e6C overnight with primary polyclonalantibody against ABCA1, ABCG1 or SR-B1 (1:500) or actin(1:10,000). After being washed for three times (15 min eachtime), the membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody[horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500) oranti-mouse (1:10,000)] for 1 h at room temperature. The signalswere detected and visualized using a LAS-3000 luminescentimage analyzer (Fujifilm, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) using AIDAimage analyzer 4.06 software (Raytest, Sprockh\u00f6vel, Germany).The indicated protein band intensity was normalized to that ofactin.RNA Extraction and AnalysisTHP-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and differentiatedinto macrophages with a 200 nM PMA treatment for 72 h.The macrophages were treated with the indicated compoundsat the indicated time points, which are described in detailin the figure legends. Total cellular RNA was extracted fromthe treated THP-1 macrophages using peqGOLD Total RNAkits (PeqLab, Linz, Austria) according to the manufacturer\u2019sinstructions. One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNAsynthesis according to the protocol of the High CapacitycDNA Reverse Transcription Kit together with RNase Inhibitor(Applied Biosystems). LightCycler R\u00a9 480 SYBR Green I Masterkit (Roche) was used for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with 40 ng cDNA from each sample for triplicatemeasurements. Amplification cycles were detected using theLightCycler 480 system (Roche). ABCA1 (HS_ABCA1_1_SGQuantiTect primer assay, Cat.no.: #QT00064869, QIAGEN)and 18S (Hs_RRN18S_1_SG QuantiTect Primer assay,Cat.no.: #QT00199367, QIAGEN) primers were used, andthe quantification was performed with the1CT method.Determination of Cathepsin ActivityThe cathepsin activity assays were performed according tothe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In general, THP-1-derivedmacrophages were cultured for 24 hwith solvent control (DMSO)or falcarindiol (10\u00b5M). After incubation, cells were washed oncewith cold PBS and lysed with chilled cell lysis buffer. Proteinconcentration was determined using the Bradford method.Hundredmicrograms of protein per reaction in 50\u00b5L of cell lysisbuffer was used for the activity measurement. Fifty microlitersof reaction buffer and 2 \u00b5L of the respective cathepsin substratewere added to 50 \u00b5L cell lysates. The assay plate was incubatedat 37\u25e6C for 1 h protected from light. The fluorescence wasquantified with Tecan Infinite 200 R\u00a9 Pro plate reader (Vienna,Austria).Statistical MethodsStatistical analysis was performedwith data acquired from at leastthree independent experiments using GraphPad Prism softwareversion 4.03 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Figureswith bar graphs represent mean \u00b1 SD. To determine statisticalsignificance, one- or two- way analysis of variance (ANOVA)were performed and p< 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSFalcarindiol Promotes Cholesterol Efflux inThp-1-Derived MacrophagesIn a previous study, we showed that falcarindiol activatesPPAR\u03b3 in HEK-293 cells transfected with a PPAR\u03b3-responsiveluciferase reporter (Atanasov et al., 2013). Considering thatPPAR\u03b3 is a known regulator of cholesterol e\ufb04ux (Chawlaet al., 2001; Chinetti et al., 2001), we aimed to investigatewhether falcarindiol can promote cholesterol e\ufb04ux in THP-1-derived macrophages. Since apo A1, the nascent and lipid freeform of HDL, is the most significant acceptor for cholesterole\ufb04uxed from macrophages (Du et al., 2015), we first studiedcholesterol e\ufb04ux mediated by apo A1. Falcarindiol enhancedapo A1-mediated cholesterol e\ufb04ux in a concentration-dependentmanner when applied at 1\u201320\u00b5M(without effect on cell viability;Figure 1B) with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50)of 5.8 \u00b5M (Figure 1C). Moreover, 10 \u00b5M falcarindiol alsosignificantly enhanced 1% human plasma-mediated cholesterole\ufb04ux (Figure 1D) as plasma containing HDL particles servedas cholesterol acceptors in the process of cholesterol e\ufb04ux.Pioglitazone, a PPAR\u03b3 agonist known to upregulate cholesterolFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 596313Wang et al. Falcarindiol Promotes Cholesterol Effluxe\ufb04ux (Ozasa et al., 2011), was used as positive control both inpresence of apo A1 and human plasma (Figures 1C,D).Falcarindiol Enhances ABCA1 ProteinExpressionThe transmembrane proteins ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-B1 aretransporters mediating cholesterol e\ufb04ux (Duffy and Rader,2006). Therefore, we investigated protein expression of thesethree transporters upon treatment with falcarindiol in THP-1-derived macrophages. As evident in Figure 2A, ABCA1 proteinlevel significantly increased in response to falcarindiol (10 \u00b5M).At the same time, there was no significant upregulation ofABCG1 (Figure 2B) or the bi-directional transporter SR-B1(Figure 2C; Stangl et al., 1999). Next, we investigated whetherincreased ABCA1 protein level is associated with an increase inABCA1 mRNA level. ABCA1 mRNA level indeed significantlyincreased upon falcarindiol (10 \u00b5M) treatment (Figure 3B, left).In macrophages, enhanced ABCA1 mRNA level might resultfrom PPAR\u03b3 and subsequent LXR activation (Chawla et al., 2001;Chinetti et al., 2001). We, therefore, asked whether the increasedABCA1 mRNA level induced by falcarindiol might be due toPPAR\u03b3-activation. To check this possibility, we used the PPAR\u03b3antagonist, BADGE (50 \u00b5M), to block the activity of PPAR\u03b3 inTHP-1-derived macrophages (Hinz et al., 2003). Indeed, BADGEblocked the falcarindiol-mediated increase of ABCA1 protein aswell as mRNA level (Figures 3A,B).Falcarindiol Inhibits ABCA1 ProteinDegradationInterestingly, the ABCA1 mRNA up-regulation by falcarindiolwas significantly lower than the mRNA induction causedby the PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone (Figure 3B, on the left),while the induction of ABCA1 protein level by falcarindioland pioglitazone was equally potent (Figure 3A, on the left).This inconsistency indicated that an additional effect offalcarindiol might exist, which could enhance ABCA1 proteinlevel besides the increase of ABCA1 mRNA level. To explorethis possibility, we measured the rate of ABCA1 proteindegradation in the presence and absence of falcarindiol. THP-1-derived macrophages were incubated with falcarindiol or solventvehicle (DMSO) for 24 h and were then further treated withcycloheximide (140 \u00b5M) to block de novo protein synthesis(Arakawa et al., 2009). As evident in Figure 4, ABCA1 proteindegradation was significantly inhibited in the presence offalcarindiol showing that the compound interferes with theABCA1 protein turnover rate.Falcarindiol Inhibits LysosomalCathepsin-Dependent ABCA1 DegradationTo further explore how falcarindiol inhibits ABCA1 proteindegradation, we first investigated, which protein degradationpathway could be affected by falcarindiol in THP-1-derivedmacrophages. As presented in Figure 5A, the application oflactacystin, an ubiquitin proteasome inhibitor, failed to affectABCA1 protein level in our experimental setting. However, theapplication of calpeptin (a calpain inhibitor) and chloroquine(a lysosome inhibitor) (Figures 5B,C) increased ABCA1 proteinlevel, similarly to falcarindiol. Falcarindiol had an additive effecton ABCA1 protein level upon co-treatment with calpeptin,indicating that its mechanism of action is likely differentfrom the calpain inhibitor calpeptin. However, there was nodifference observed with or without chloroquine in the presenceof falcarindiol, suggesting that falcarindiol might interfere withprotein degradation in the lysosome, mimicking the effect ofchloroquine (Figure 5C).The lysosomal degradation pathway is a well-known regulatorof ABCA1 protein turnover (Neufeld et al., 2001; Santamarina-Fojo et al., 2001; Mizuno et al., 2011) and cathepsins are wellestablished proteases mediating the lysosomal proteolysis ingeneral (Turk et al., 2012; Appelqvist et al., 2013). Therefore,FIGURE 2 | Falcarindiol increases ABCA1 protein level. Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were treated with solvent vehicle control (DMSO), falcarindiol (Fal, 10 \u00b5M),or the PPAR\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone (Pio, 10 \u00b5M). After 24 h, cells were lysed and 20 \u00b5g protein was resolved via SDS-PAGE.

Falcarindiol Promotes Cholesterol EffluxFIGURE 3 | The PPAR\u03b3 antagonist, BADGE, blocks falcarindiol-mediated ABCA1 protein and mRNA induction.

ABCA1 protein (A) and mRNA (B) level were analyzed by westernblotting and qPCR, respectively.

DifferentiatedTHP-1 macrophages were stimulated with 10 \u00b5M falcarindiol (black circles) oran equal amount of the solvent vehicle control (DMSO; white circles). After 24h incubation, cells were treated with cycloheximide (140 \u00b5M) and lysed atdifferent time points (0, 10, 20, 40 min). Western blotting was used to monitorthe decline of ABCA1 protein level upon cycloheximide treatment in thepresence or absence of falcarindiol. All data are mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3) and vs.solvent vehicle control (DMSO): *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, n.s. not significant(two-way ANOVA/Bonferroni).we investigated whether the proteolytic activity of lysosomalcathepsins is affected by falcarindiol. Figures 6A\u2013E shows thatamong the tested cathepsins (B, D, K, L, S) the activity ofcathepsin B, S, and K were significantly suppressed by 35, 14,and 8%, respectively. Overall, these data indicate that falcarindiolleads to the suppression of ABCA1 degradation and inhibitslysosomal cathepsins.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we describe for the first time that falcarindiol, atypical constituent of Apiaceae vegetables, stimulates cholesterole\ufb04ux by promoting ABCA1 gene expression in THP-1-derivedmacrophages. In addition, we show that falcarindiol increasesABCA1 protein stability and inhibits the proteolytic activity oflysosomal cathepsins.Macrophage cholesterol e\ufb04ux is a process counteractingthe transformation of macrophages into pro-atherogenic foamcells. Thus, the study of this process and molecules that canregulate it is of significance for potential approaches to combatCVD (Rosenson et al., 2012; Du et al., 2015). ABCA1 is themost important membrane transporter for cholesterol e\ufb04uxfrom macrophages (Du et al., 2015). Treatment of THP-1-derived macrophages with falcarindiol increased ABCA1 proteinexpression (Figure 2). In contrast, the expression level of theother two cholesterol transmembrane transporters, SR-B1 andABCG1, remained unchanged. In THP-1 macrophages, SR-B1was shown to be co-expressed with caveolin-1 and to enhanceselectively cholesterol ester uptake rather than cholesterole\ufb04ux (Matveev et al., 1999). Interestingly, both ABCA1 andABCG1 proteins seem to be tightly regulated by PPAR\u03b3 asshown in studies using full agonists of PPAR\u03b3 (Chawla et al.,2001; Ozasa et al., 2011). Falcarindiol, in contrast, works asa partial PPAR\u03b3 agonist in HEK-293 cells (Atanasov et al.,2013). Thus, the fact that the abundance of ABCG1 proteindid not significantly increase in response to falcarindiol mightbe explained by the partial agonism of the compound. Thecontribution of PPAR\u03b3 to falcarindiol-induced ABCA1 proteinexpression was demonstrated by co-treatment experiment withBADGE, a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist (Figure 3).

Falcarindiol Promotes Cholesterol EffluxFIGURE 5 | Effect of specific inhibitors of the proteasome (A) calpain (B), and lysosomal (C) protein degradation pathways on ABCA1 protein level in the presence orabsence of falcarindiol. Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were pre-treated with or without falcarindiol (Fal) at 10 \u00b5M for 24 h and incubated for another 3 h with theproteasome inhibitor lactacystin (Lact) at 10 \u00b5M (A), the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (Calp) at 30 \u00b5g/mL (B), or the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (Chlq) at 100 \u00b5M (C).Cells were lysed and protein was resolved via SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was used to monitor ABCA1 protein level under the indicated treatment conditions.All data are mean \u00b1 SD (n = 4) and vs. solvent vehicle control (DMSO): *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, n.s. not significant (one-way ANOVA/Bonferroni).FIGURE 6 | Falcarindiol inhibits several lysosomal cathepsins. (A\u2013E) Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were incubated for 24 h with or without falcarindiol (10 \u00b5M).Cells were lysed and cathepsin activity (S, B, L, K, and D) was determined by fluorescence measurements. Irreversible inhibitors of cathepsin B, S, L, and K(Z-FF-FMK; 1 \u00b5M) and cathepsin D (pepstatin A; 10 \u00b5M) were used as positive controls and directly added to the control lysates. All data are mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3) andvs. solvent vehicle control (DMSO): *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, n.s. not significant (one way-ANOVA/Bonferroni).suggest a synergistic effect between ABCA1 and ABCG1 in thecontext of cholesterol e\ufb04ux (Gelissen et al., 2006; Hsieh et al.,2014). Although they exhibited a similar degradation rate inCHO cells, ABCG1 degradation seems to work by differentdegradation mechanisms than that of ABCA1. In addition, thereare differences in the protein stability of two ABCG1 isoforms(Gelissen et al., 2010).We also demonstrate that falcarindiol inhibits proteindegradation of ABCA1 in the presence of cycloheximide, a denovo protein synthesis inhibitor (Figure 4). Several proteolyticFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 596316Wang et al. Falcarindiol Promotes Cholesterol Effluxpathways have been described to mediate ABCA1 degradationin different cell types, particularly the calpain-, lysosome-, andproteasome-mediated pathways (Wang et al., 2003; Mizuno et al.,2011; Liu and Tang, 2012; Yokoyama et al., 2012). Applyingspecific inhibitors of these three proteolytic pathways, we foundthat falcarindiol mimics the effect of lysosomal proteolysisinhibitor chloroquine on ABCA1 levels (Figure 5).Cathepsins are well-established lysosomal proteases (Turket al., 2012). A variety of cathepsins (e.g., cathepsin B, D,K, L, S) are known to be expressed and to serve importantregulatory functions in macrophages (Punturieri et al., 2000;Beers et al., 2003; Bracke et al., 2005; Vasiljeva et al.,2006). Measuring the activity of lysosomal cathepsins knownto be expressed in macrophages revealed that falcarindiolsimultaneously suppresses the activity of cathepsin B, S, and K.Among these three cathepsins, cathepsin S and K were proposedto reduce cholesterol e\ufb04ux from macrophages (Lindstedt et al.,2003; Lutgens et al., 2007) and knockout of cathepsin S or K geneswas shown to lead to decreased atherosclerosis in mice (Sukhovaet al., 2003; Lutgens et al., 2006). Cathepsin B was also found tobe highly expressed and active in murine atherosclerotic lesions(Chen et al., 2002; Lutgens et al., 2007). The potential of cathepsinB, S, and K to influence ABCA1 protein level regulation furthersupports the concept for their implication in atherosclerosis.To the best of our knowledge, interference of falcarindiol withcathepsins or with lysosomal function was never reported before.In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time thatfalcarindiol is able to increase macrophage cholesterol e\ufb04ux.Falcarindiol upregulates ABCA1 protein level by promoting itsPPAR\u03b3-driven gene expression and by extending its protein half-life. Moreover, our findings reveal the inhibition of lysosomalproteases as a new possiblemechanism of action of this importantdietary constituent. These data advance our knowledge forthe molecular mechanisms, by which small molecules regulatemacrophage cholesterol e\ufb04ux, and might have implication forthe development of novel therapeutics or dietary supplements forthe prevention or treatment of CVD.CONCLUSIONIn the present study, we demonstrated that falcarindiol enhancescholesterol e\ufb04ux and increases ABCA1 protein level by twocomplementary mechanisms, i.e., promoting ABCA1 geneexpression and inhibiting ABCA1 protein degradation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSLW: Performed most of the experiments, analyzed the results,and drafted the manuscript.

In the presentwork, we aimed to assess the chemical profiles and biological effects of Ononis natrixsubsp. hispanica extracts (ethyl acetate, methanol, and water). For chemical profile, totaland individual phenolic components were detected. For biological effects, antioxidant(DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC, FRAP, phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelating assays),enzyme inhibitory (against cholinesterase, tyrosinase, \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase),antimicrobial, DNA protection and cytotoxic abilities were tested. The predominantphenolics were apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin in the tested extracts. Generally, theethyl acetate and methanol extracts were noted as the most active in the antioxidantand enzyme inhibitory assays. Water extract with different concentrations indicated highlevel of DNA protection activity. Methanol and ethyl acetate extracts showed antibacterialeffect against to Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Thecytotoxic effects of O. natrix subsp. hispanica extracts on the survival of HeLa andPC3 cells were determined by MTT cell viability assay. Water and methanol extractscaused initiation of apoptosis for PC3 cell line. Furthermore, molecular docking wasperformed to better understand interactions between dominant phenolic compoundsand selected enzymes. Our results clearly indicate that O. natrix subsp. hispanicacould be considered a potential candidate for designing novel pharmaceuticals,cosmeceuticals and nutraceuticals.Keywords: Ononis, bioactive compounds, natural agents, pharmaceuticals, molecular dockingINTRODUCTIONIn the twenty first century, the usage of plant or plant products are undergoing a revolutionas sources of prominent (functional and bioactive) compounds. For example, artemisininwas awarded as an anti-malarial compound in Nobel Prize for Medicine 2015 (Omura andCampbell, 2015). From this point, to better combat the lifestyle, communicable or infectiousdiseases, many phytochemicals have been suggested as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer319Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicaand anti-mutagenic agents (Fernandes et al., 2017; Losada-Barreiro and Bravo-D\u00edaz, 2017; Meeran et al., 2017; Yin et al.,2017). These facts provide encouragement for designingfurther studies on the plants. Within these perspectives,the term of functional products has emerged and it isdefined as any products which provide health benefitsincluding treatment of afore-mentioned diseases. In thisframework, uninvestigated wild plants could be considered as aspringboard for designing novel functional products with lowtoxicity.The genus Ononis (Fabaceae) is represented by 75 speciesin the world especially Europe and Central Asia (Wollenweberet al., 2003). The genus comprises of 23 taxa in Tukey andknown as \u201csemisk\u201d and \u201ckay\u0131s\u00b8k\u0131ran\u201d in Turkish name (Baytop,1999; Sohretoglu, 2007; M\u00fckemre et al., 2015). In the literature,several studies were reported that member of the genus Ononisexhibited significant biological activities, such as antimicrobialeffect (Mhamdi et al., 2015; Sayari et al., 2016), antioxidant(Mhamdi et al., 2015; Mezrag et al., 2017), wound healing(S\u00fcntar et al., 2011), cytotoxic (Kuete et al., 2013; Ghribi et al.,2016), and analgesic (Y\u00f5lmaz et al., 2006). In addition, thedecoctions from Ononis species is used for treating urinaryproblems, skin disorders as well as gout (Baytop, 1999; Erdemgilet al., 2002; Liebezeit, 2008). With this in mind, Ononis specieshave been sold as herbal tea on the market as single orcombined with other diuretic plants (Gampe et al., 2016). Severalpublications have appeared in recent years documenting onbiological activities of some Ononis species along with theirphytochemicals profiles (Daruh\u00e1zi et al., 2008; Al-Rehaily et al.,2014; Ghribi et al., 2015; Yousaf et al., 2015; Gampe et al., 2016;Casiglia et al., 2017; Mezrag et al., 2017). However, to the bestof our knowledge, there is no report on the chemical profile andbiological ability of Ononis natrix subsp. hispanica. Thus, thepresent study aims to provide more details about chemical andbiological properties of O. natrix subsp. hispanica. The observedfindings could be provide new insights for O. natrix subsp.hispanica.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant Material and Preparation of theExtractsOnonis natrix subsp. hispanica was collected from Antalya-Turkey during of flowering season (June 2015). Taxonomicidentification of the plant material was confirmed by the seniortaxonomist Dr. Murad Aydin Sanda, from the Department ofBiology, Selcuk University. The voucher specimen has beendeposited at the Herbarium of the Department of Biology, SelcukUniversity, Konya-Turkey.To obtain ethyl acetate and methanol extracts, the air-driedaerial parts (10 g) were macerated with 200mL of these solventsat room temperature (25\u25e6 \u00b1 1\u25e6C) for 24 h. The extracts wereconcentrated under vacuum at 40\u25e6C by using a rotary evaporator.To obtain water extract, the powdered samples were boiled with250mL of distilled water for 30min. The aqueous extract wasfiltered, lyophilized (\u221280\u25e6C, 48 h), and all extracts stored at +4\u25e6C in the dark until use.Total Phenolics, Flavonoids, and PhenolicCompositionThe total phenolics content was determined by Folin-Ciocalteumethod (Slinkard and Singleton, 1977) with slight modificationand expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE/g extract), whiletotal flavonoids content was determined using AlCl3 method(Zengin et al., 2014) with slight modification and expressed asrutin equivalents (RE/g extract).Phenolic compounds were evaluated by RP-HPLC(Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). Detectionand quantification were carried out with a LC-10ADvp pump, aDiode Array Detector, a CTO-10Avp column heater, SCL-10Avpsystem controller, DGU-14A degasser and SIL-10ADvp autosampler (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD).Separations were conducted at 30\u25e6C on Agilent R\u00a9 EclipseXDB C-18 reversed-phase column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm length, 5\u00b5m particle size). Phenolic compositions of the extracts weredetermined by a modified method of Zengin et al. (2014). Gallicacid, protocatechuic acid, (+)-catechin, p-hydroxybenzoic acid,chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, (\u2212)-epicatechin, syringic acid,vanillin, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, benzoic acid,o-coumaric acid, rutin, hesperidin, rosmarinic acid, eriodictyol,trans-cinnamic acid, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, andapigenin were used as standards. Identification and quantitativeanalysis were done by comparison with standards. The amountof each phenolic compound was expressed as microgram pergram of extract using external calibration curves, which wereobtained for each phenolic standard.Antioxidant and Enzyme Inhibitory AssaysAntioxidant [DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging, reducing power(CUPRAC and FRAP), phosphomolybdenum and metalchelating (ferrozine method) and enzyme inhibitory assays(cholinesterase (Elmann\u2019s method), tyrosinase (dopachromemethod), \u03b1-amylase (iodine/potassium iodide method) and\u03b1-glucosidase (chromogenic PNPG method)] were performedaccording to our previous researches (Zengin et al., 2014; Zengin,2016). Antioxidant capacities were expressed as equivalents oftrolox and EDTA (for metal chelating). In addition, the enzymeinhibitory activities of the extracts were evaluated as equivalentsof standard inhibitors per gram of the plant extract (galantaminefor AChE and BChE, kojic acid for tyrosinase, and acarbose for\u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition assays).Molecular ModellingReceptors PreparationThe crystalline structure of the selected enzymes togetherwith their inhibitors have been downloaded from the ProteinDatabank RCSB PDB (Berman et al., 2000): acetylcholinesterase(pdb:4X3C) (Pesaresi and Lamba, in press) in complexwith tacrine-nicotinamide hybrid inhibitor, butyrilcholinesterase(pdb:4BDS) (Nachon et al., 2013) in complex with tacrine,amylase (pdb:1VAH) (Zhuo et al., 2004) in complex with r-nitrophenyl-\u03b1-D-maltoside, glucosidase (pdb:3AXI) (Yamamotoet al., 2011) in complex with maltose and tyrosinase (pdb:2Y9X)(Ismaya et al., 2011) in complex with tropolone. The rawcrystal structures were prepared for the docking experiments asFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600320Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicapreviously reported (Mocan et al., 2016; Uysal et al., 2016). Non-catalytic water molecules, inhibitors and all the other moleculespresent in the pdb files were removed by using UCSF Chimera(DeLano, 2002) and the proteins alone were neutralized at pH7.4 by PropKa implemented in Maestro 10.2 suite (Maestro,2015). Seleno-cysteines and seleno-methionines, if present, wereconverted to cysteines and methionines, respectively. All themissing fragments and other errors present in the crystalstructures were automatically solved by the Wizard ProteinPreparation implemented in Maestro 10.2 suite (Maestro, 2015).Ligands Preparation(+)-Epicatechin, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin and rosmarinicacid were selected as representative compounds to carry outmolecular docking study, as these compounds were presentin abundance in the herbs extracts. The chemical structurethe selected compounds are reported in Figure 1. The threedimensional structures have been downloaded from Zincdatabases (Irwin et al., 2012) and used for molecular modelingexperiments after preparation. The ligands were prepared by theLigPrep tool embedded in Maestro 10.2, neutralized at pH 7.4 byIonizer and minimized by OPLS3 force field (Shelley et al., 2007).Molecular DockingDockings of the representative substances have been performedfor each selected enzyme employed for the in vitro enzymaticinhibition tests in this work. Glide embedded in the maestro suite10.2 has been employed for the docking calculations by usingthe \u201ceXtra Precision\u201d scoring function for all the enzymes andthe mm-GBSA binding energy has been calculated by the useof Prime embedded in maestro 10.2 (Table 1; Jones et al., 1997).In all cases, the binding pocket was determined automatically bycentering the grid on the crystallographic inhibitor, extended ina radius of 10 Angstroms from the center. The best pose for eachcompound docked to the selected enzymes was the best rankedamong the 10,000 generated.DNA ProtectionDNA protection activity of the studied extracts was analyzedusing pUC19 plasmid DNA (pDNA). Plasmid isolation wasperformed by Thermo Scientific Genejet Plasmid Miniprep Kit.The reaction mixture contained 5\u00b5L of Fenton\u2019s reagent (30mMH2O2, 50mM ascorbic acid, and 80mM FeCI3), 5 \u00b5L of theseextracts at two different concentrations (5 and 10 mg/mL) and3 \u00b5L of pDNA (300 \u00b5g/\u00b5L). Final volume of reaction mixturewas brought up to 20 \u00b5L using double-distilled water. Positivecontrol was composed of 12\u00b5L of distilled water, 5\u00b5L of Fenton\u2019sreagent and 3\u00b5L of pDNA. Negative control involved only 17\u00b5Lof distilled water and 3 \u00b5L of pDNA. Samples were incubated for30min at 37\u25e6C and 4 \u00b5L loading dye (Thermo Scientific, USA)was added to the all mixtures. The DNA mixtures were run on0.8% agarose gel and then visualized under ultraviolet light cabin.Biological replication of test was carried out at three times andband density was determined by the gel image analysis software(Quantum, Vision-Capt., Vilber Lourmat SAS, France) (Ozkanet al., 2015).Cytotoxic EvaluationCell Culture MaterialsHeLa and PC3 cancer cell lines were obtained from SelcukUniversity, Faculty of Science, and Department of Biochemistry.Penicillin/Streptomycin, EMEM cell culture media, Ham\u2019s F-12 cell culture media, Fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin, MTT,ethanol, 2-prophanol, 60 \u00d7 15 mm corning plates and 75 cm2FIGURE 1 | Chemical structure of apigenin, luteolin and quercetin.TABLE 1 | Binding energy and glide XP docking scores.Compounds AChE* BChE* \u03b1-amylase* \u03b1-glucosidase* Tyrosinase*XP 1G XP 1G XP 1G XP 1G XP 1GApigenin \u22129.6 \u221260.6 \u22129.4 \u221252.5 \u22125.98 \u221235.2 \u22125.7 \u221217.2 \u22125.7 \u221226.1Benzoic A. \u22124.0 \u221214.2 \u22124.9 \u221222.3 \u22123.88 \u22120.03 \u22122.3 +71.8 \u22125.1 +41.7(\u2212)-Epicat. \u22129.3 \u221241.5 \u22127.3 \u221241.0 \u22127.03 \u221238.1 \u22126.9 \u221221.8 \u22125.5 \u221220.9Luteolin \u22129.6 \u221252.9 \u22128.0 \u221253.3 \u22126.54 \u221254.0 \u22126.7 \u221230.3 \u22125.1 \u221229.3Quercetin \u221210.3 \u221262.9 \u22127.9 \u221243.5 \u22128.79 \u221252.9 \u22126.9 \u221231.2 \u22125.4 \u221228.3Rosmarinic A. \u221211.3 \u221264.5 \u221210.9 \u221242.8 \u22128.26 \u221246.8 \u22126.5 \u221222.6 \u22126.3 \u221212.2*1G values (Binding energy) are expressed in Kcal/mol.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600321Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicacorning flasks were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).Cell Culture MaintenanceCulture media were prepared with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep) solution. Preparedmedium was kept at +4\u25e6C and warmed at 37\u25e6C before using.Cells (HeLa, PC3) were proliferated in incubator (37\u25e6C including5% CO2). Stock cells were proliferated in 75 cm2 sterile corningflasks and experiment cell cultures were proliferated in 60 \u00d7 15mm sterile petri dishes. In the logarithmic phase of the growth(when reached to\u223c80% cell confluency), cells were sub-cultured(Karakurt and Adali, 2016).Preparation of Plant ExtractionDilutions weremade to obtain extract concentration of 10mg/ml.The water extract was suspended in PBS and other extracts weresuspended in DMSO (Dimethylsulfoxide)/water (1:5) and thediluted extracts were centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g during 2 min, andsupernatants were filtrated (having the diameter of 0.22 \u00b5m poresize) and they were kept in\u221220\u25e6C.MTT Cell Viability TestA total of 10.000 PC3 and HeLa cells were seeded in 96-wellplates and allowed to fasten on the wells for 24 h. After 24 h,cells were treated with different doses of the tested extracts (0.1,1, 2.5, 5, and 10mg for water) (0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 \u00b5gfor ethyl acetate and methanol) for 24 h. After exposure timecompleted, the medium was changed with EMEM and Ham\u2019sF12 medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS + 0.5 mg/ml MTTfor HeLa and PC3 cancer cells, respectively. Then, they wereincubated at 37\u25e6C with 5% CO2, for 4 h. After that time, the cellswere treated with 3% SDS+ 40 mMHCl/isopropanol for 15minin order to dissolve the MTT-formazan crystals (Yerlikaya et al.,2016). The absorbance of each sample was recorded at 570 nm.Cell survival rate was calculated by using GraphPad Prism 3.03software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).Antimicrobial ActivityAntimicrobial activity test was performed by disc diffusionmethod. Nutrient agar mediumwas used for test microorganismsand microorganisms were refreshed in 100 mm sterile petridishes. Single colony of bacterial strain was inoculated in20ml nutrient broth medium for 24 h at 37\u25e6C incubator. Afterbacteria concentration was made visible in %9 sterile NaCIand its turbidity was standardized to 0.5 McFarland by addingbacterial suspension. Bacterial suspension seeded to 100mmpetri dishes. After the tested extracts were dissolved in DMSOand saturated on discs, they were incubated at room temperaturefor drying. They were placed on the inoculated petri plateswith microorganisms for 24 h at 37\u25e6C incubator. Test wasreplicated at least three times and results were analyzed bymeasuring inhibition zone. Microorganisms were illustrated onTable 2.Statistical AnalysisAll the assays were carried out in triplicate.

Statistical differences between the extracts were analyzedby using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followedby Tukey\u2019s honestly significant difference post-hoc test (\u03b1 =0.05). All the analysis was carried out using SPSS v22.0software.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPhytochemical CompositionIn the last decades, many studies highlighted biologicalactivities of phenolic compounds, such as antioxidant, anticancer,antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory. Flavonoids are the mostabundant group of phenolics and considered as natural bioactiveagents for designing novel functional products. In this sense,the amounts of total phenolics and flavonoids contents in O.natrix extracts were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu and AlCl3methods. The greatest content of total phenolics was noticed inthe ethyl acetate extract (60.19 mgGAE/g extract), followed bymethanol (59.22 mgGAE/g extract) and water (35.12 mgGAE/gextract) extracts. Similar results were observed for flavonoidas well (Table 3). These findings were confirmed by severalresearchers who reported the higher concentration of totalphenolics in ethyl acetate and methanol extracts (Do et al.,2014; Murugan and Parimelazhagan, 2014). In a previous study(Mhamdi et al., 2015), the total phenolic content of O. natrixin Tunisia was reported as 51 mgGAE/g, which was lower thanthat found in the present study. Moreover, some researcherswere found to be different levels of total phenolics in severalOnonis species, such as O. spinosa (3.09 mgGAE/g extract)(Orhan et al., 2012), O. pubescens (17.23 mgGAE/g extract), andO. ornithopodioides (20.96 mgGAE/g extract) (Sarik\u00fcrkc\u00fc et al.,2016).Individual phenolic constituents in the tested extracts wereanalyzed by HPLC-DAD and the results are given in Table 4.A total of 23 standard phenolics were used and 21 of themwere identified in these extracts. Two compounds (rutin andhesperidin) were not detected in the extracts. Apigenin wasFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600322Yerlikaya et al.

Other dominant phenolics were luteolin,epicatechin, and rosmarinic acid in these extracts. However,the most abundant phenolics in the water extract were benzoicacid and quercetin. In recent studies, the detected phenolics inO. natrix extracts possess a broad range of biological activitiesincluding antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial and enzymeinhibitory (L\u00f3pez-L\u00e1zaro, 2009; Amoah et al., 2016; David et al.,2016). In this framework, the observed biological activities forO. natrix extracts might be explained with the presence of thesephenolic components. To the best of our knowledge, this studyis the first report which indicates comprehensive analysis ofphenolic constituents of O. natrix. In this sense, the presentfindings could be opened new horizons for the genus Ononis andit\u2019 usages.Antioxidant CapacityIn order to evaluate antioxidant ability of O. natrix extracts,several methods were performed: free radical scavenging(DPPH and ABTS), reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP),phosphomolybdenum and metal chelating assays. DPPH andABTS assays are widely utilized to examine radical scavengingactivities of plant extracts or synthetics. These assays are basedon the reduction of ABTS+ and DPPH\u00b7 in the presence ofantioxidants and the changes (from blue to white in ABTS;from purple to yellow in DPPH) can spectrophotometrically berecorded. In addition, the assays reflect to hydrogen donatingabilities of antioxidants. As shown in Table 3, the methanol andwater extracts had similar DPPH scavenging abilities whereas thelowest ability was observed in the ethyl acetate extract. However,ABTS radical scavenging abilities can be ranked as ethyl acetate>Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600323Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicamethanol>water. The apparent differences can be attributedto nature of these radicals (ABTS assay is considered as bothhydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant systems, while DPPH isonly hydrophobic systems). Our findings are consistent withprevious results, which were reported different results for DPPHand ABTS (Kim et al., 2002; Zengin et al., 2015, 2017; Bouhlaliet al., 2017).Reducing power is an important way in the antioxidantmechanisms and it reflects electron-donating abilities ofantioxidants. From this point, CUPRAC and FRAP assays wereperformed to detect reducing abilities of O. natrix extracts(Table 5). By using CUPRAC assay (from Cu2+ to Cu), the ethylacetate extract showed the strongest reducing ability, followedby methanol and water extracts. These results are in line withthe total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Nevertheless, theFRAP (from Fe3+ to Fe2+) abilities decreased in that orderwater (106.12 mgTE/g extract)>ethyl acetate (90.71 mgTE/gextract)>methanol (79.73 mgTE/g extract). This finding forwater extract in FRAP assay might be related to complexinteractions of phytochemical (antagonistic etc.) described asPe\u00f1a-Cerda et al. (2017) and (Hmid et al., 2017).Phosphomolybdenum assays is proposed by Prieto et al.(1999), which is based on the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V)by the antioxidants and then a green phosphate/Mo (V) complexoccurs at the acidic pH. The assay is also considered as one oftotal antioxidant capacity assays. Within O. natrix extracts, themethanol extract (1.53 mmolTE/g extract) exerted the strongestability in phosphomolybdenum assay, followed by ethyl acetate(1.27 mmolTE/g extract) and water (1.13 mmolTE/g extract)extracts (Table 4). In the literature, several researchers reporteddifferent approaches for a correlation between total phenolic andthe reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) (Albayrak et al., 2010; Kocaket al., 2016; Amessis-Ouchemoukh et al., 2017). At this point, thisactivity for the methanol extract may be related to the presence ofother antioxidants as well as phenolics.Transition metal ions, such as iron and copper are involved inthe production of hydroxyl radical via Fenton and Haber-Weissreactions. In this sense, the metal chelating ability is consideredas an important way in the antioxidant mechanisms. Contraryto expectations, the metal chelating ability significantly differsfrom other antioxidant assays and the strongest activity wasobserved in water extract with 14.49 mgEDTAE/g, while the ethylacetate extract had the lowest ability (Table 5). These findings areconsistent with previous studies, which reported no correlationbetween total phenolic and metal chelating ability (Silva et al.,2011; Hatami et al., 2014; Khorasani Esmaeili et al., 2015). Infact, the metal chelating abilities of phenolics were described asa minor way in theirs antioxidant properties by Rice-Evans et al.(1996).Enzyme Inhibitory EffectAlzheimer\u2019s diseases (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) areconsidered as major public health problems and their incidencetends to increase at an alarming rate (more than 35.6 millionAD patients in worldwide and is expected to be more than100 million AD patients by 2050). The development of newtherapeutic approaches (also in terms of non-pharmacologicaltherapy supplement) for these diseases has become a pressingissue. Among the therapeutic approaches, the inhibition ofkey enzymes is considered as one of most effective strategy(Wimo and Prince, 2010). Cholinesterase inhibitors are currentlyused as a drug for the treatment of AD. The inhibitorsincrease brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels by preventing thebreakdown of ACh and this case is very important tocognitive function (Menichini et al., 2014). Again, \u03b1-amylaseand \u03b1-glucosidase release glucose from larger carbohydrates(especially starch) and are key enzymes in DM glucose levelcontrol (Kubinova et al., 2014). In this direction, both \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors are promising drugs inthe treatment of DM. In addition, tyrosinase is a main enzymein the synthesis of melanin and thus tyrosinase inhibitorsare useful for controlling hyperpigmentation problems. Withinthe framework of these information\u2019s, many enzyme inhibitorsare synthetically produced. However, most of them showlimited effectiveness especially related to side effects, such asgastrointestinal disturbances, and toxic properties (Kumar et al.,2011). Therefore, many scientists have focused on naturallyoccurring compounds from plants as potential sources of eithernew or safe effective inhibitors.Thus, we tested enzyme inhibitory effects of Ononis extractsagainst to cholinesterases, tyrosinase, amylase and glucosidase.The results are represented in Table 6. The ethyl acetate extractexhibited the strongest cholinesterase inhibitory effect on bothAChE (1.46 mgGALAE/g extract) and BChE (0.93 mgGALAE/gextract). However, the water extract was not active on BChE.The observed activity for ethyl acetate extract may be linkedto higher level of phenolics in the extracts. Our findings wereconfirmed by several researchers (Kennedy andWightman, 2011;Roseiro et al., 2012; Mazlan et al., 2013; Hlila et al., 2015),who reported a linear correlation between phenolic contentand anti-cholinesterase abilities. Interestingly, the ethyl acetateextract did not have any inhibitory effect on tyrosinase and theTABLE 5 | Total antioxidant capacity (phosphomolybdenum assay), reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP assays) and metal chelating activities of the extracts.Extracts Phosphomolybdenum (mmolTE/g extract) CUPRAC (mgTE/g extract) FRAP (mgTE/g extract) Metal chelating (mgEDTAE/g extract)Ethyl acetate 1.27 \u00b1 0.07* 183.37 \u00b1 0.02 90.71 \u00b1 1.79 9.16 \u00b1 0.17Methanol 1.53 \u00b1 0.08 170.51 \u00b1 0.57 79.73 \u00b1 1.17 12.02 \u00b1 1.40Water 1.13 \u00b1 0.03 94.16 \u00b1 0.99 106.12 \u00b1 0.44 14.49 \u00b1 0.64TE, trolox equivalents; EDTAE, EDTA equivalents.*Values expressed are means \u00b1 S.D. of three parallel measurements.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600324Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicawater extract had remarkable anti-tyrosinase effect with 52.81mgKAE/g extract. As for amylase and glucosidase inhibition, theethyl acetate (0.74 mmolACAE/g and 17.52 mmolACAE/g) andmethanol extracts (0.59 mmolACAE/g and 19.94 mmolACAE/g)had the greatest abilities compared to water extract. The higherconcentrations of phenolics in these extracts may be responsiblefor their anti-diabetic effects. In accordance with our findings,some phenolic components were reported as anti-diabetic agents(Tundis et al., 2010; Etxeberria et al., 2012; R\u00edos et al., 2015).From this point, molecular approaches could be valuable tounderstand interactions of enzymes and phenolics. To the bestof our knowledge, this study is the first report on Ononis natrixTABLE 6 | Enzyme inhibitory effects of the extracts.Extracts AChE \u0131nhibition(mgGALAE/gextract)BChE \u0131nhibition(mgGALAE/gextract)Tyrosinase \u0131nhibition(mgKAE/g extract)\u03b1-amylase \u0131nhibition(mmolACAE/gextract)\u03b1-glucosidase\u0131nhibition (mmolACAE/gextract)Ethyl acetate 1.46 \u00b1 0.07* 0.93 \u00b1 0.01 na 0.74 \u00b1 0.02 17.52 \u00b1 0.28Methanol 1.29 \u00b1 0.05 0.64 \u00b1 0.06 11.20 \u00b1 2.30 0.59 \u00b1 0.01 19.94 \u00b1 0.11Water 0.02 \u00b1 0.01 na 52.81 \u00b1 5.15 0.17 \u00b1 0.01 3.69 \u00b1 0.17GALAE, galanthamine equivalents; ACAE, acarbose equivalents; KAE, kojic acid equivalents; na, not active.*Values expressed are means \u00b1 S.D. of three parallel measurements.FIGURE 2 | (A) Best pose of apigenin docked to AChE and (B) to BChE.FIGURE 3 | (A) Best pose of apigenin docked to \u03b1-amylase and (B) to \u03b1-glucosidase.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600325Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicasubsp. hispanica. Taken together, this study could provide astarting point on this species and could open new perspectivesfor designing novel functional products.Molecular DockingEvidence from the literature supports the inhibitory action ofapigenin on AChE and BChE (Katalinic\u00b4 et al., 2010; Xie et al.,2014). Apigenin was also reported to induce moderate inhibitoryeffect on \u03b1-amylase (Li et al., 2014; Wulan et al., 2014) and on\u03b1-glucosidase. On the other hand, we have found that the waterextract possesses good inhibition activity toward tyrosinase. Thismay be attributed to the presence of luteolin and quercetin.In light of the observed inhibitory activity, in silico moleculardocking simulation was used to investigate the interactionsbetween apigenin to AChE, BChE, amylase and glucosidase,whereas luteolin and quercetin have been selected as principalFIGURE 4 | Best pose of (A) luteolin and (B) quercetin docked to tyrosinase.FIGURE 5 | percentage of DNA protection analysis and gel view of plasmid DNA protection test for each Ononis natrix extracts.

A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicainhibitors of tyrosinase. The most representative enzyme-ligandcomplexes were reported in Figures 2\u20134.Apigenin has been previously reported to inhibit both AChEand BChE by IC50 of 7.72 micro/Mol (Balkis et al., 2015) and37.4 micro/Mol (Katalinic\u00b4 et al., 2010), respectively. The bestdocked pose interacts with AChE in the binding pocked byestablishing two hydrogen bonds to Glu199 and Ser122 andtwo pi-pi stacks to Phe330 and Trp 84 with a docking scoreof \u22129.607 and a binding energy of \u221260.64 Kcal/Mol. Apigeninalso interacts with several residues present in the binding pocketof BChE forming two hydrogen bonds to Thr120 and Glu197with a docking score of \u22129.459 and a binding energy of \u221252.54kcal/Mol. Also, considering the abundance in the ethyl acetateand methanol extracts, apigenin could be also responsible for theamylase and glucosidase inhibiting activity. Indeed, it has beenpreviously reported that apigenin was an efficacious inhibitor of\u03b1-glucosidase with a IC50 of and a moderate \u03b1-amylase inhibitorwith a IC50 of 10.5 \u00b5/Mol (Zeng et al., 2016).Apigenin interacts with \u03b1-glucosidase by forming twohydrogen bonds to Asp215 and Gln353 and with the enzymaticcavity of \u03b1-amylase by forming three hydrogen bonds to Gln63,His299, and Glu233. The aqueous extract has shown a strongactivity toward tyrosinase. Themost abundant substances presentin the extracts are benzoic acid, luteolin and quercetin. All ofthese substances have been demonstrated to have an tyrosinaseinhibitory activity in in vitro experiments (IC50= quercetin 0.13mM) (Chen and Kubo, 2002). However, benzoic acid reporteda scarce docking score (\u22125.1) and a positive binding energy(+41.7 Kcal/Mol) which indicate none or very little affinity forthe binding pocket of the enzyme, whereas the luteolin andquercetin have obtained the best binding energy. (\u221228 Kcal/Moland\u221229.31 Kcal/Mol, respectively).However, it is noteworthy to highlight that the plant extractscontain several phenolic compounds which in less extent areable to inhibit the tested enzymes all with non-competitivemechanism as demonstrated in our previous paper (Picot et al.,2017). Inhibitory action of the plant extracts on AChE, BChE,tyrosinase, \u03b1-amylase, and \u03b1-glucosidase might be due to theconcerted action of several phenolic compounds rather than asingle molecule.DNA Protective EffectsVarious stress factors, such as oxidative stress, acid, alkaline,UV, and heavy metals can damage DNA. ROS formed byhydroxyl radicals cause DNA strand breakage that is broughtabout carcinogenesis, mutagenesis and cytotoxicity (Golla andBhimathati, 2014). Here, we targeted to measure the DNAdamage by Fenton reaction-mediated oxidative stress. Fenton\u2019sreagent (Fe2+ + H2O2 \u2192 Fe3+ + OH\u2212 + .OH) produces thehighly deleterious hydroxyl radicals that damage the cellularcomponents, such as DNA, lipid and proteins. The scavengingeffect of extract was tested in plasmid nicking assay. Figure 5illustrates the DNA protection activity of theOnonis extracts withtwo different concentrations (5 and 10 mg/ml). Ononis extractedin water (10 mg/ml) had the most effective on protectionof DNA with 78%, followed by water (5 mg/ml) (70%) andmethanol extract with 5mg/ml (53%). Except for the ethyl acetateextract (5 and 10 mg/ml), water and methanol extracts protectedsupercoiled form of pDNA and indicated DNA protectionactivity.FIGURE 6 | Cells morphology of HeLA and PC3 cancer cell lines after application of different extracts of Ononis natrix. Control and different concentrations of extractswere tested in HeLA or PC3 cancer cell lines and indicated for each figures.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600327Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicaIn the present study, the water extract had the most protectionactivity on DNA. This can be arisen from availability of differentmetabolites in water extract. Quercetin and sinapic acid areonly metabolites which found in this extract. So, it can beconcluded that these chemicals may be responsible for protectionof DNA from Fenton reagent. Like water extract, the methanolextract also contained specific metabolite, such as rosmarinicacid. In this sense, the observed DNA protection ability for themethanol extract can be arisen from presence of higher amountof rosmarinic acid. Therefore, it seems that different ingredientsof the extracts may cause formation of DNA protection propertyfor the tested extracts. According to DNA protection assayresults, water extract ofOnonis natrix showed themost protectiveactivity for DNA. This result may be explained by determinationof phenolic components in the extracts using HPLC analysis. Asindicated inTable 4, rosmarinic acid and quercetin were themostdissolved components in methanol and water extracts of Ononisnatrix, respectively. So, it can be concluded that rosmarinicacid and quercetin can be considered as potential chemicalsfor protection of DNA from free radicals, hydroxyl radicalsand mutagens. Quercetin is a well-investigated antioxidantknown as promising molecule for pharmacological studies. In acomprehensive research for DNA protection ability of quercetin,its supplementation indicated protection of nuclear DNA fromoxidative damage and significant genoprotective activity onmitochondrial DNA (Potenza et al., 2008). In a different study,three polyphenolic compounds including luteolin, quercetinand rosmarinic acid, were investigated for their protectiveeffects against oxidative DNA damage (Silva et al., 2008).They found that all of these phenolics were protection agentsagainst oxidative stress-induced DNA damage. In another search,protective activity of pure rosmarinic acid and elagic acid wereevaluated. It has been found that they have equal effect ondeclining AAPH-induced oxidative DNA damage (Vattem et al.,2006). These results are in accord with our study indicating thatmethanol and water extracts of Ononis natrix can be consideredFIGURE 7 | Cell viability assay (MTT) analysis of HeLA and PC3 cancer cell lines after application of different extracts of Ononis natrix. White bars and striped barsindicate controls and significantly different applications, respectively.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600328Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicaas valuable DNA protectors because of presence of rosmarinicacid and quercetin.Cytotoxic EffectsThe cytotoxic effects of Ononis natrix on the survival of HeLaand PC3 cells were determined by MTT cell viability assay. HeLacervical cancer cell line and PC3 prostate cancer cell line weretreated with these extracts with different concentrations for 24 h.Cells morphology was observed under inverted microscope andillustrated in Figure 6. According to morphological appearance,there was no significant apoptotic effect onOnonis natrix extractsfor HeLa cell line. However, the water and methanol extractscaused initiation of apoptosis for PC3 cell line. To indicate effectof three extracts on cancer cell lines, cell viability assay (MTT)was also conducted. Although there was a cytotoxic activity forHeLa cells after application of the water extract, no significantdecline was observed in cancer cell numbers compared tocontrol (Figure 7). On the other hand, 2.5mg water extract,1mg methanol extract and 0.1 \u00b5g ethyl acetate extract caused asignificant cell number reduction on PC3 cancer line (Figure 7).Ethyl acetate extract indicated cytotoxic activity with the smallestconcertation (0.1 \u00b5g) among all extracts. 2.5mg of the waterextract showed dose-independent cytotoxic effect on PC3 cell linesince there was no effect for 5mg and 10mg water extracts. Ithas been considered that concentration of water extract morethan 2.5mg may be toxic against healthy or normal viable cells.Thus, it can be concluded that 2.5mg is amoderate concentrationfor cytotoxicity on PC3 cancer cell line. It was also monitoredthat other treatments had cytotoxic effect whereas, they were notsignificantly different from control sample anymore.According to reports, about 60% of anticancer drugs areisolated from plant-derived natural compounds. These medicinalplants highly contain polyphenolic compounds which areactually inhibitors for cancer development (Sukumaran et al.,2016). Cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of the studied extractson HeLa and PC3 cell lines were investigated. Although therewas no significant variation on HeLa cells, 2.5mg of water and1mg methanol extracts leaded to cytotoxic activity comparedto control in PC3. Some of phenolic compounds show anti-proliferative effect which depends on polarity of compounds.Cytotoxic effect of methanol extract can be explained withthe presence of rosmarinic acid, apigenin, and epicatechin.Effect of anti-carcinogenic and scavenging of reactive oxygenradicals of rosmaniric acid were particularly searched in Perillafrutescens (Osakabe et al., 2004). The body\u2019s response to cancershowed parallel effects with the inflammatory response. Since,inflammatory cytokine networks may affect survival, growth,mutation, proliferation, differentiation and relocation of tumorand stromal cells (David, 1988; Balkwill and Mantovani, 2001;Osakabe et al., 2004). Rosmaniric acid is a water-solublepolyphenolic compound and has function on inhibition ofangiogenesis (Huang and Zheng, 2006). There was a potentialevidence that ROS acts as initiating angiogenesis and onsetof cancer mechanism. It was proved that hydrogen peroxidestimulated angiogenesis in vitro condition (Shono et al., 1996;Yasuda et al., 1999; Huang and Zheng, 2006). Rosmaniric acidreduced ROS expression, hydrogen peroxide level and VEGF(Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) level that are importanton cancer development (Huang and Zheng, 2006). Furthermore,the previous report which indicated effect of methanolic extractof plant species on antioxidant activity and examination of levelof rosmaniric acid (Tepe, 2008). In addition, in our previousstudy, three extracts (ethyl acetate, methanol and water) of twoPotentilla species (Potentilla reptans and P. speciosa) showedcytotoxic activity against A549 andMCF-7 due to some phenoliccompounds (Uysal et al., 2017). The findings of this analysissuggest that one or more than one phenolic compounds andtheir interaction may cause initiation of apoptosis in cancer celllines. However, further investigation should be performed in invivo test to arrive at a definite judgment for inhibition of cancerdevelopment.Antimicrobial EffectsAntimicrobial activity of the extracts from O. natrix subsp.hispanica were searched against to 13 bacteria and 1 fungusby the disk diffusion method. The extracts were loaded thedisks at the concentration of 10, 50, and 100 mg. According toresults, 50 and 100mg of methanol and ethyl acetate extractsshowed the best antibacterial effect against to Staphylococcusaureus ATCC 25923 and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains(Figure 8). In addition, 100mg water extracts had a small effecton Salmonella kentucky. It was realized that extracts possessedmore protective effect against to gram positive bacteria strains. Inaddition, concentration-dependent effect was also observed. Forexample, S. epidermis stain was more sensitive against to 100mgof methanol and ethyl acetate extracts than 50mg ones. Methanoland ethyl acetate extracts ofO. natrix subsp. hispanica were moreeffective than water extract for antimicrobial analysis. The resultsof this analysis support the idea that because of higher totalphenolic and flavonoid contents of methanol and ethyl acetateFIGURE 8 | Antimicrobial activity of methanol, ethyl acetate and water extractsof Ononis natrix against to S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis andS. kentucky.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600329Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicaextracts, they indicated more antimicrobial activity than waterone.Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) is a gram positivebacterium and causes several human infections and leads tosanitary problems. S. aureus also shows resistance to someantibiotics and drugs particularly to methicillin (Hannan et al.,2008). Resistance problems induced to researchers to tend forseeking novel therapy. S. epidermidis together with S. aureuslead to severe infectious diseases (Otto, 2009). S. epidermidis ismore being tend to cause infectious diseases due to developingpersistent infection on human skin (Otto, 2009). Researchersare seeking the mechanisms by which S. epidermidis promotesdiseases (Otto, 2009). In a study of Sayari et al. (2016)Ononis natrix leaves extracts were tested against to 9 bacterialstrains (5 gram-negative and 4 gram-positive). Consistentlywith our study, S. aureus were the most susceptible againstto Ononis natrix leaves extracts. In another study, S. aureus(ATCC 25923), and E. coli (ATCC 25922) were found to havemore sensitivity against the Ononis natrix essential oils withinhibition zone as 27 and 25, respectively (Elamrani and Benaissa,2010).CONCLUSIONIn recent years, pharmaceuticals and functional ingredients fromplant sources have been of paramount interest. In this sense,chemical profile and biological abilities of O. natrix subsp.hispanica were investigated in the current work. As far aswe aware, this work is the first report on this species. Thetested extracts, especially ethyl acetate and methanol, exhibitednotable biological effects correlated with higher levels of bioactivecompounds. The results obtained from the present work providea new framework for utilization of the genus Ononis and as aresult, O. natrix subp. hispanica could be suggested as a naturalsource of bioactive agents, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial andanticancer. We hope that our research will serve a base for futurestudies for in vivo and bioavailability studies on O. natrix subsp.hispanica.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSSY, GZ, MB, and YC set up and carried out experiments.

The majority of theseproducts have a long history of use, but non-harmonized trade and differences inregulatory policies between countries impact their value chains and lead to concernsover product efficacy, safety and quality. Veronica officinalis L. (common speedwell),a member of Plantaginaceae family, has a long history of use in European traditionalmedicine, mainly in central eastern Europe and the Balkans. However, no specifiedcontrol tests are available either to establish the quality of derived herbal products orfor the discrimination of its most common substitute, V. chamaedrys L. (germanderspeedwell). In this study, we use DNA metabarcoding and high performance liquidchromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to authenticate sixteenV. officinalis herbal products and compare the potential of the two approaches todetect substitution, adulteration and the use of unreported constituents. HPLC-MSshowed high resolution in detecting phytochemical target compounds, but did notenable detection of specific plant species in the products. DNA metabarcoding detectedV. officinalis in only 15% of the products, whereas it detected V. chamaedrys in 62% ofthe products. The results confirm that DNA metabarcoding can be used to test forthe presence of Veronica species, and detect substitution and/or admixture of otherVeronica species, as well as simultaneously detect all other species present. Our resultsconfirm that none of the herbal products contained exactly the species listed on thelabel, and all included substitutes, contaminants or fillers. This study highlights theneed for authentication of raw herbals along the value chain of these products. Anintegrative methodology can assess both the quality of herbal products in terms oftarget compound concentrations and species composition, as well as admixture andsubstitution with other chemical compounds and plants.Keywords: adulteration, DNA metabarcoding, herbal products, HPLC-MS, Veronica chamaedrys, VeronicaofficinalisFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378333fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 2Raclariu et al. DNA Metabarcoding for Authentication of Veronica officinalis ProductsINTRODUCTIONTraditional herbal medicines play an important role in meetinghealthcare needs around the world, and complementary andalternative medicines based on these are gaining in importance inmany industrialized countries as a perceived healthy alternativeto synthetic pharmaceuticals (World Health Organization, 2013).The commercialization of such products is undergoing atransition process from unregulated locally traded products tointernationally traded mass produced herbal pharmaceuticalsand food supplements (Heinrich, 2010; Leonti and Casu,2013). A challenge in ethnopharmacology is to study suchnovel herbal products and their value chains (Heinrich,2010; Atanasov et al., 2015), as these are impacted by non-harmonized regulatory and trade policies (Booker et al., 2012,2016).The regulation of herbal products varies globally andbetween EU member countries, these falling under specificlegislation depending on their intended use, for instance, as food,food supplements, herbal medicines, or homeopathic products.Similar to the United States and Canada, the EU currently doesnot have a centralized marketing authorization procedure forherbal products, but instead provides relevant methodologicalspecifications to guarantee manufacturing quality. The EU alsolacks a central public institution for pharmacovigilance of theherbal products, and the primary legal responsibility for safety ofthe marketed herbal products is delegated to the pharmaceuticalindustry, whereas national pharmacovigilance agencies monitordrug safety.A lack of standards for studies of medicinal plants has beenpreviously identified (cf. R\u00edos and Recio, 2005; Gertsch, 2009)and several authors have advocated a stronger guidance of valuechains to mitigate this shortcoming (Rios et al., 1988; Cos et al.,2006; Verpoorte, 2008). Current quality assessment methods relymainly on morphology and analytical chemistry based methodsdetailed in national or EU pharmacopoeias (EDQM - Councilof Europe, 2014). However, the resolution of these methods ishighly influenced by factors such as the phenotypic plasticity,morphological cryptic taxa, species-specific chemical markers,growing conditions, harvesting process, storage condition, or theextraction procedure (Barnes, 2003; Bickford et al., 2007; Jianget al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2012).In addition to ensuring that herbal products contain theintended ingredients in the right quantities, an importantproblem is the use of substitutes and undeclared fillers (Coghlanet al., 2012, 2015; Newmaster et al., 2013). Misidentification(Saslis-Lagoudakis et al., 2015) or incongruences in thevernacular names of the raw material (Farah et al., 2006;Ouarghidi et al., 2012; Walker and Applequist, 2012; De Boeret al., 2015) can lead to accidental substitution, but rising pricesof raw materials and the high demand for such products alsoprovide an incentive for deliberate adulteration. The use ofunlabelled ingredients presents a serious safety challenge asadverse drug reactions cannot be associated to the product labeland ingredients (Heubl, 2010; Gilbert, 2011). Recent studies ofherbal medicine and herbal food supplement value chains using acombination of phytochemical and metabolomics analyses havefound that adulteration of these products often occurs in thefirst stages of their value chains (Booker et al., 2012, 2014,2016).Veronica officinalis L. (common speedwell) is a popularmedicinal plant in several European countries, especially incentral eastern Europe and the Balkans, and used in herbalmedicine both traditionally and increasingly in commercialherbal products. Veronica L. (Plantaginaceae) is a genusof about 450 species (Albach and Meudt, 2010) occurringover most of the Northern Hemisphere and in many partsof the Southern Hemisphere (Mabberley, 2008). Modernsystematic studies of the genus have focused on molecularphylogenies of several nuclear and plastid markers: the nuclearribosomal internal transcribed spacer, nrITS (Wagstaff andGarnock-Jones, 1998; Albach and Chase, 2001; Albach et al.,2004; Buhk et al., 2015), the plastid regions trnL-F (Albachet al., 2004, 2006; Buhk et al., 2015), ndhF-rpl32 (Sonibareet al., 2014; Albach and Al-Gharaibeh, 2015; Buhk et al.,2015), trnH-psbA (Sonibare et al., 2014; Albach and Al-Gharaibeh, 2015), rps16 intron (Albach and Chase, 2004),rps16\u2013trnK (Sonibare et al., 2014; Albach and Al-Gharaibeh,2015).Ethnopharmacological Importance ofVeronica SpeciesSeveral Veronica species are used in European traditionalmedicine to treat respiratory affections, as an expectorant,an antiscorbutic, a diuretic, and for wound healing (Baytop,1984; Harput et al., 2002a). In Turkey, the aerial parts ofVeronica anagallis-aquatica L. are boiled in milk to obtaina poultice used to alleviate abdominal pain (K\u00fcpeli et al.,2005), or used as a bath cure to relieve rheumatic pain(Fujita et al., 1995). In the Valdesi valley of Italy, in thepoorer villages Veronica species are traditionally used as aninexpensive substitute for imported teas and this has beenposed as an explanation of the modern use of Veronicaspecies in recreational teas (Bellia and Pieroni, 2015). Intraditional Chinese medicine V. anagallis-aquatica is used forthe treatment of influenza, hemoptysis, laryngopharyngitis,and hernia (Su et al., 1999). In Europe, V. officinalis isthe best-known and most commonly used species (Table 1).The main ethnopharmacological indications for V. officinalisare inflammatory conditions, rheumatism, stomach ulcers,respiratory ailments (Scarlat et al., 1985; Mocan et al., 2015b), andnervous, cardiovascular and metabolism system disorders (Voglet al., 2013).Phytochemical and PharmacologicalStudiesVeronica species are rich in iridoid glucosides, mainly aucubin,catalpol and benzoic and cinnamic acid esters of catalpol, allcompounds that have previously been investigated for theirbioactivities (Harput et al., 2002a,b, 2014; Saracoglu et al., 2002).Saracoglu and Harput (2012) showed that some iridoid glucosidesof V. anagallis-aquatica, V. persica Poir, and V. thymoidesP.H.Davis subsp. pseudocinerea M.A.Fisch. exhibited cytostaticFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378334fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 3Raclariu et al.

(2002a) showed that V. cymbalaria Bodard,V. hederifolia L., V. pectinata L. var. glandulosa, V. persica andV. polita Fr. possess anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic and radicalscavenging activities. Vogl et al. (2013) showed for the firsttime in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts preparedfrom V. officinalis. Nikolova (2011) found that V. bellidioidesL., V. kellereri Degen & Urum., V. vindobonensis (M.A.Fisch.)M.A.Fisch., V. beccabunga L., V. rhodopea Degen ex Stoj.& Stef. and V. austriaca L. showed significant antioxidantproperties.Quality Issues of Veronica officinalisHerbal ProductsAs a folk remedy, V. officinalis is used mostly in traditionalmedicine, and no current national pharmacopeia monographsinclude standards for quality control or authentication ofVeronica herbal products. Identification tests currently availableto detect substitutes and adulterants rely on chromatographicmethods, usually as a combination of separate approaches (e.g.,HPLC with TLC-densitometry) or a combination of differentapproaches into a single procedure (e.g., HPLC-UV, HPLC-MSor GC-MC) (European Medicine Agency [EMA], 2006; EDQM -Council of Europe, 2014).All raw materials of V. officinalis used in the marketed herbalproducts are harvested from the spontaneous flora, and sourcedfrom several countries in central eastern Europe and the Balkans.Kathe et al. (2003) and Ichim et al. (2011) cite that the exploitationpressure of wild-harvesting could potentially threaten the species.The limited availability of V. officinalis is a likely driver behindthe widespread substitution with V. chamaedrys L. (germanderspeedwell), an abundant herb of grassland and forest edges,with no proven therapeutic uses Cris\u00b8an et al. (2007, 2011).Furthermore, even though their vegetative morphology is clearlydistinct, the flowers of V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys caneasily be confused (Leyel, 1937). Cris\u00b8an et al. (2001, 2011)report histological, anatomical and phytochemical charactersthat distinguish V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys and propose arapid differentiation method using thin-layer chromatography(TLC) of species-specific phenyl-propanoic compounds. Theseanalytical methods enable chemical identification of some targetcompounds, but cannot rule out that other Veronica species,or mixtures thereof, might be present in the investigatedproducts. Marketed herbal products are complex formulationsthat are usually highly processed and consist of numerousingredients.DNA Barcoding and MetabarcodingRapid advances in DNA sequencing have enabled cost-effectiveuse of DNA sequences for species identification. Hebert et al.(2003) coined the concept of DNA barcoding as a rapid andaccurate way of species-level identifications using short standardDNA regions. Different combinations of plastid markers (e.g.,rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA) and the nuclear ribosomal internaltranscribed spacer (nrITS) have been proposed as the primarybarcodes for plants, and the current core barcodes are rbcLand matK, supplemented by nrITS (Kress and Erickson, 2007;CBOL Plant Working Group, 2009; China Plant BOL Group,2011; Hollingsworth et al., 2011). Several studies have shownthat about 75\u201385%, and in some floras over 90%, of plantspecies can be identified to species level using DNA barcoding(Lahaye et al., 2008; Kress et al., 2009, 2010; Chen et al.,2010; Burgess et al., 2011). In taxonomically difficult plantgroups, where hybridization is frequent, or in lineages ofrelatively young age the use of traditional barcodes may notbe reliable (Kress and Erickson, 2007; Fazekas et al., 2009).In such groups the use of low-coverage shotgun sequencingof genomic DNA could resolve relationships and augmentcurrent plant barcodes (Coissac et al., 2016; Hollingsworth et al.,2016).Techen et al. (2014) reviewed the progress made in DNAbarcoding of medicinal plants. DNA barcoding of herbal productshas revealed alarming levels of substitution within marketedherbal products, for instance, 6% in saw palmetto herbaldietary supplements (Little and Jeanson, 2013), 16% in ginkgoproducts (Little, 2014), 25% in black cohosh (Baker et al., 2012),33% in herbal teas (Stoeckle et al., 2011), 50% in ginseng(Wallace et al., 2012), 37% in Senna and 50% in Cassia marketproducts (Seethapathy et al., 2014). Newmaster et al. (2013)Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378335fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 4Raclariu et al. DNA Metabarcoding for Authentication of Veronica officinalis Productstested 44 herbal products sold in North America using DNAbarcoding and found that 59% contained species not listedon the label, and only 2 out of 12 screened companies hadproducts free of substitution, contamination or unreportedfillers. DNA metabarcoding, a combination of high-throughputsequencing (HTS) and polymerase chain reaction based DNAamplification, provides simultaneous taxonomic identificationof taxa from samples containing DNA from different origins(Taberlet et al., 2012). DNA metabarcoding studies are providinginsights into species composition of complex mixtures of DNAsuch as processed herbal products. For example, Coghlanet al. (2012) evaluated the species composition of fifteenhighly processed traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) andfound that these contained species and genera included onCITES appendices I and II. Similarly, Cheng et al. (2014)found a high level of contamination within 27 investigatedherbal preparations, Ivanova et al. (2016) found that all 15tested herbal supplements contained species not listed on theproduct label, and Raclariu et al. (2017) authenticated 78Hypericum perforatum herbal products and found the targetspecies in only 68% products while detecting incongruencebetween constituent species and those listed on the label in allproducts.In this study we test the hypothesis that dwindling availabilityof wild V. officinalis has resulted in admixture of V. chamaedrysand other Veronica species in Veronica herbal products.Substitution of V. officinalis with V. chamaedrys would notonly be fraudulent from a commercial perspective, but wouldalso leave anticipating consumers with a herbal product withoutproven therapeutic activity. We approach this hypothesis usingDNA metabarcoding and HPLC-MS to authenticate and detectspecies diversity in European Veronica herbal products, and aimto answer the following research questions: (1) Can HPLC-MSbe used to distinguish V. officinalis from V. chamaedrys and toidentify exclusive presence of V. officinalis in herbal products?;(2) Can DNA metabarcoding be used to test for the presenceof V. officinalis in herbal products, to detect substitution andadulteration for other Veronica species and/or presence of otheroff label plant species?MATERIALS AND METHODSSample CollectionSixteen single and multi-ingredient herbal products includingV. officinalis on the label were purchased from retail stores andpharmacies (14) and via e-commerce (2). The products includedherbal teas (12), extracts (2), capsules (1), and candies (1).An overview of the samples is included in the SupplementaryTable S1, but identifying information on the producer/importer,product name, lot number, expiration date is withheld foranonymity. The herbal products were imported to Norway underNorwegian Medicines Agency license no. 16/04551\u20132.For DNA barcoding, nrITS reference sequences of 118accessions belonging to 56 Veronica species were compiled intoa barcode reference database, consisting partly of sequencesmined from NCBI/GenBank and partly of sequences generatedwithin the project from specimens collected in 2014 and 2015(Supplementary Table S2). For the phytochemical analyses, aerialparts of V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys (samples marked withan asterisk in Supplementary Table S2) were used as referencesfor the identification and quantification of the main compounds.Voucher specimens of the plant material used in this study aredeposited in the Herbarium of the Alexandru Borza BotanicalGarden (CL) of Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania(Supplementary Table S2).Phytochemical AnalysisHigh-Performance LiquidChromatography-Mass Spectrometry(HPLC-MS)Extracts were prepared from plant material and herbal productsfollowing established procedures (Cris\u00b8an et al., 2010; Mocan et al.,2015a,b), with slight modifications. One gram of each samplewas extracted with 10 ml of 70% ethanol (HPLC grade) at roomtemperature for 1 h in a sonication bath (Polsonic 3, PolsonicInc., Poland). The extracts were filtered through MN 615 filterpaper (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Germany) and stored at 4\u25e6Cuntil further analysis. Prior to HPLC-MS analysis the extractswere syringe filtered with a 0.45 \u00b5m nylon membrane (WhatmanInc., United States).Target Veronica iridoids (aucubin, catalpol, catalposide, andveronicoside) from all sixteen herbal products as well as aerialplant parts were analyzed by HPLC-MS on a Agilent 1100liquid chromatography system equipped with a binary pump,autosampler, thermostat and detector (all 1100 Series fromAgilent Inc., United States). The system was controlled withData Analysis software (version B01.03, Agilent Inc., UnitedStates). The separation was carried out on an Atlantis HILIC3.5 \u00b5m (100 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm i.d.) (Waters Inc., UnitedStates) column equipped with an online 0.2 \u00b5m filter (AgilentInc.), at a working temperature of 40\u25e6C, a flow rate of0.75 ml/min and an injection volume of 6 \u00b5l. A binarygradient system with eluent (A) 0.1% acetic acid and 20 \u00b5Msodium acetate in water, and eluent (B) 0.1% acetic acidand 20 \u00b5M sodium acetate in acetonitrile was used for theanalyzed samples with the following gradient: 95\u201380% B (1\u20135 min). The HPLC system was coupled with an Agilent IonTrap 1100 SL mass spectrometer equipped with an electrosprayionisation (ESI) source and operated in the positive modewith a scan range between 360 and 680 m/z, to identify thetarget compounds based on their sodium adducts (M+23 m/z):aucubin (369 m/z), catalpol (385 m/z), catalposide (505 m/z)and veronicoside (489 m/z), and by comparison with analyticalstandards in the same chromatographic conditions. The capillaryvoltage was set to 4 kV and the capillary temperature to325\u25e6C. Nitrogen (N2) was used as dry gas with a dry flowof 12 l/min and a pressure of 60 psi for the nebulizer.For quantitation of the iridoids, stock solutions of the fourcommercially available standards substances (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St.Louis, Missouri, United States) were prepared in acetonitrile,and different concentrations of each standard were used.

The results are expressed as \u00b5g per g of dry weightmaterial (\u00b5g/g dw).Genetic AnalysisDNA Extraction, PCR Amplification and DNASequencingThe total DNA was extracted from 300 mg of each homogenizedherbal product or silica gel dried leaves, using a modifiedCTAB extraction protocol (Doyle and Doyle, 1987; Kool et al.,2012). Two extraction negative controls were included toscreen for contamination and cross-contamination. Total DNAextracts of the herbal products were quantified and assessed forfragmentation with a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced AnalyticalTechnologies, Inc., Ankeny, IA, United States) using the DNF-488-33 HS (High Sensitivity) genomic DNA Reagent Kit (50 \u201340000 bp). Total DNA extracts of silica gel dried leaves werequantified with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies,Carlsbad, CA, United States) using the dsDNA BR (Broad-Range) kit. PCR amplification using nrITS primers, ITS-4and ITS-5 (White et al., 1990), was done on purified totalDNA from the dried leaves, using a final reaction volume of25 \u00b5l, including 2.5 \u00b5l 10X reaction buffer II (supplied withthe polymerase), 2.5 \u00b5l 25 mM MgCl2 (supplied with thepolymerase), 0.2 \u00b5l 5 U/ml AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase (AppliedBiosystems, Foster City, CA, United States), 2.5 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M dNTPs(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States), 2.5 \u00b5l10 \u00b5M of each primer (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo, UnitedStates), 2.5 \u00b5l 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumen (BSA) (RocheDiagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), 9.3 \u00b5l of Milli-Qultrapure water and 0.5 \u00b5l of template DNA solution (1 ng/\u00b5l).The PCR cycling protocol consisted of initial denaturation at94\u25e6C for 2.5 min, followed by 32 cycles of denaturation at 94\u25e6Cfor 30 s, annealing at 53\u25e6C for 30 s, and elongation at 72\u25e6Cfor 50 s, followed by a final elongation step at 72\u25e6C for 4 min.Three PCR negative controls were included per amplificationto control for external and cross-sample contamination. 6 \u00b5lof each PCR products was purified using 2 \u00b5l 10 times dilutedExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, United States)by incubation at 37\u25e6C for 45 min followed by 15 min at 80\u25e6C.Sequencing was performed using the ABI BigDye Terminatorsequencing buffer and the v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (AppliedBiosystems, Foster City, CA, United States) on an ABI3130XLautomated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,United States). The sequences were edited, and the forward andreverse sequences assembled using SeqTrace (Stucky, 2012). Thesequences were submitted to NCBI/GenBank and their accessionnumbers are listed in the Supplementary Table S2.Barcode Gap AnalysisThe reference sequences of 118 accessions belonging to 56Veronica species were aligned using AliView (Larsson, 2014),and pairwise genetic distances between the accessions werecalculated using MEGA 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013) for each ofthe following regions: nrITS1, nrITS2, and the entire nrITS.Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) (Puillandre et al.,2012) was used to determine the genetic distance thresholdand automatically define species delimitation hypotheses. ABGDdetermines the number of groups (hypothetical species) withina dataset using pairwise sequence distances and two inputvariables, prior intraspecific diversity (P) and minimum gapwidth (X) (Puillandre et al., 2012). Based on this informationABGD makes an initial partition of the supplied sequencesinto candidate species groups based on a statistically inferredbarcode gap and then applies recursive partitions to each groupto generate subsequent partitions into candidate species until nofurther splitting occurs (Puillandre et al., 2012). The minimumgap width (X) was set to X = 1.0, the prior intraspecific diversity(P) was set to range from 0.001 to 0.1, and the p-distance, Jukes-Cantor (JC) and Kimura 2 Parameter (K2P) distance metrics wereused in the ABGD analyses (Jukes and Cantor, 1969; Kimura,1980), resulting in 18 analyses (6 per dataset). Default values wereused for all other parameters (steps: 10 and Nb bins: 20). Thetotal numbers of groups corresponding to the prior intraspecificdivergence (P) values, ranging from 0.001 to 0.1, were recorded(Supplementary Table S3).To determine whether V. officinalis can be unambiguouslydifferentiated from its main adulterant, V. chamaedrys, usingmolecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs), the intra- andinterspecific variation of all reference sequences of these species,respectively, 16 accessions belonging to V. officinalis and 9 toV. chamaedrys, were analyzed based on pairwise comparisonof nrITS genetic distances using Taxon DNA/SpeciesIdentifier v1.7.8 (Meier et al., 2006).DNA MetabarcodingFusion primers of the internal transcribed spacers nrITS1 andnrITS2, based on primers 17SE and 5.8I1, and 5.8I2 and 26SE(Sun et al., 1994) (Biolegio B.V., the Netherlands), were usedto generate PCR based amplicons. Forward primers were fusedwith a unique 10 bp multiplex identifier (MID) tags and thereverse primers with a truncated version of adapter P1 (trP1)tags. Expected amplicon sizes were 300\u2013350 bp. PCR reactionson DNA extracted from the herbal products were carried outin final reaction volumes of 25 \u00b5l including 0.5 \u00b5l of templateDNA solution (ranging from 0.5 to 2 ng/\u00b5l), 5 \u00b5l 5X Q5reaction buffer (New England Biolabs Inc., United Kingdom),1.5 \u00b5l 10 \u00b5M of each primer (Biolegio B.V., the Netherlands),0.5 \u00b5l 10 mM dNTPs, 0.25 \u00b5l 20 U/\u00b5l Q5 High-Fidelity DNAPolymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., United Kingdom), 5 \u00b5l5X Q5 High GC enhancer and 10.75 \u00b5l of Milli-Q ultrapurewater. The PCR cycling protocol consisted of initial denaturationat 98\u25e6C for 30s, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98\u25e6Cfor 10s, annealing at 56\u25e6C for nrITS1 or 71\u25e6C for nrITS2 for30 s, and elongation at 72\u25e6C for 30 s, followed by a finalelongation step at 72\u25e6C for 2 min. Eight PCR negative controlswere included per amplification to control for external and cross-sample contamination.Agencourt AMPure XP PCR purification (Beckman CoulterInc., United States) was used for high-throughput purificationof PCR amplicons. The size, purity and the molar concentration(nmol/l) of each amplicon library was measured using aFragment AnalyzerTM (Advanced Analytical Technologies Inc.,United States) with a DNF-910 dsDNA Reagent Kit (35\u20131,500 bp), equimolar pools (2 ng/\u00b5l/library) were preparedFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378337fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 6Raclariu et al. DNA Metabarcoding for Authentication of Veronica officinalis Productsfrom the amplicon libraries using a Biomek 4000 LaboratoryAutomation Workstation (Beckman Coulter Inc., United States).To identify the optimum bead-to-template ratio for templatepreparation, the concentration of the purified pooled ampliconlibraries was analyzed with a Fragment AnalyzerTM (AdvancedAnalytical Technologies, Inc., United States) using a DNF-488High Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit. The pooled IonAmpliSeq libraries (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher ScientificInc., United States) for emulsion PCR and sequencing chiploading were prepared using an Ion Chef (LT). The DNA templateconcentration was adjusted to the number of Ion Sphere Particles(ISPs) and added to the emulsion PCR master mix. The template-positive ISPs were enriched and sequenced on an Ion TorrentPersonal Genome Machine (LT) using Ion 318 v2 chips (LT) andthe Ion PGM Sequencing 400 kit (LT). Sequencing read data wasinitially processed and demultiplexed based on MIDs into FASTQfiles using Ion Torrent Suite Software version 5.0.4 (LT).Bioinformatics AnalysisSequencing reads were processed using the HTS barcode-checkerpipeline freely available at https://github.com/naturalis/HTS-barcode-checker (Lammers et al., 2014). The nrITS1 and nrITS2primer sequences were used to split the reads based on theprimer sequence. Read lengths and Phred quality scores wereassessed using PRINSEQ (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011), andbased on these values reads with a mean Phred quality score ofless than 26 and a length of less than 300 bp were filtered out.The remaining reads were trimmed to a maximum length of350 bp. Reads were clustered into MOTUs using three differentsequence similarity thresholds during clustering, respectively, 97,99 and 100%, with a minimum of 10 reads per cluster using CD-HIT-EST (Li and Godzik, 2006). A representative sequence fromeach MOTU was taxonomically assigned using local Basic LocalAlignment Search Tool (local BLAST) (Altschul et al., 1990),with a maximum e-value of 0.05 and a minimum hit length of100 bp, against a reference database consisting of a local copy ofthe NCBI nucleotide database (Benson et al., 2013). Species levelidentifications were assigned when similarity to the referencebarcode matched at>99%.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPhyotochemical AnalysisHigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography-MassSpectrometry (HPLC-MS)Iridoids and iridoid glycosides are specific chemotaxonomicmarkers for the genus Veronica, and most Veronica speciescontain the iridoid glycosides aucubin and/or catalpol as well asone or more 6-O-esters of catalpol (i.e., veronicoside, catalposide)(Afifi-Yazar and Sticher, 1980; Taskova et al., 2002, 2004; Jensenet al., 2005). The main known ethnopharmacological indicationfor Veronica species are inflammatory diseases (rheumatism,stomach ulcer) or respiratory ailments (Scarlat et al., 1985;Mocan et al., 2015a), and several studies have shown thatiridoid glycosides in Veronica are linked to this therapeuticeffects (Scarlat et al., 1985; Gr\u00fcndemann et al., 2013; Ignjatovic\u00b4,2015). Although regulatory guidelines to establish quality controlor authentication of Veronica herbal products are lacking, thepresence and concentration of specific iridoid glycosides hasbeen shown to enable authentication of Veronica herbal products(Cris\u00b8an et al., 2010; Gr\u00fcndemann et al., 2013).The HPLC-MS results from the present study show thecharacterization of Veronica herbal products against fourcommercially available iridoid glycosides, namely aucubin,catalpol, veronicoside and catalposide (Table 2). The twomost commonly identified compounds in the examined herbalproducts and reference plant material were aucubin and catalpol.From a pharmaceutical point of view, the concentrations ofthe compounds present in different herbal remedies or plantmaterials cannot be neglected as they are directly linked to theirpharmaceutical efficacy and effectiveness. Aucubin was found infifteen herbal products samples as well as in the reference plantmaterial of both species (V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys), withthe highest concentration in sample 9. Aucubin concentrationsin the herbal products and reference plant material show a largevariation with concentrations ranging from 0.33 to 39.73 \u00b5g/g.Catalpol was found in 13 herbal products, with the highestconcentration in sample 11, but was missing in two of thereference plant samples (V. off 4 and V. cha 1). No iridoidglycosides were identified in sample 14, a lozenge with nineteeningredients listed on the label. Jensen et al. (2005) concludes thataucubin and/or catalpol is/are present in all Veronica species,implying that if sample 14 contains any material of Veronica thiswould be below the level of detection of the HPLC-MS platformwe used in this study, and consequently unlikely to exert anypharmacological activity. Concerning the other two 6-O-estersof catalpol, veronicoside was present in five herbal products andin all V. officinalis reference material, with highest concentrationin sample V. off 1, while catalposide was present in nine herbalproducts, with the highest concentration in sample 8, but none ofthe investigated reference plant materials contained catalposide.Jensen et al. (2005) states that although aucubin and/or catalpolare present in all Veronica species, V. micrantha is the only speciesin Veronica subgenus Chamaedrys, to which V. chamaedrysbelongs, that contains aucubin. However, this assumption waslater rejected by Cris\u00b8an et al. (2010) that identified both aucubinand catalpol in V. chamaedrys, and as well as by the results of thisstudy.Genetic AnalysesBarcode Gap AnalysisSpecies-level identification using DNA barcoding andmetabarcoding requires that the level of intraspecific geneticdivergence is lower than the interspecific genetic divergence(Meyer and Paulay, 2005), and several identification approachesare based on setting a cut-off threshold above which a querysequence is considered to be distinct from a reference sequence.Defining an optimal threshold is a controversial debate (Hebertet al., 2004; Meyer and Paulay, 2005; Smith et al., 2005; Wiemersand Fiedler, 2007; Chen et al., 2013). Previous studies proposeddifferent thresholds of genetic distances, for instance, 1%(Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2013), 3% (Smith et al., 2005) or theFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378338fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 7Raclariu et al.

The three distance metricsused for the analyses produced identical initial partitions withineach dataset and for all the values of prior intraspecific diversity(P), but with a slight difference between the datasets, respectively,14 groups for nrITS and nrITS2 and 13 for nrITS1. The recursivepartitions resulted in a variable number of groups within eachdataset depending on P, respectively, with 18, 22, 37, and 53groups for nrITS dataset, 14, 19, and 37 groups for nrITS1, and16, 23, 31, and 54 groups for nrITS2 data set.Infra- and interspecific divergence based on pairwisecomparison of nrITS genetic distances of V. officinalis andV. chamaedrys (Supplementary Table S4) helped to identify anoptimal clustering threshold for analysis of high-throughputsequence data and accurate molecular identification anddiscrimination of the two species. Pairwise intraspecific geneticdistances did not exceed 1.5%, and furthermore 93.8% ofthe pairwise intraspecific distances were below 1%. Pairwiseinterspecific genetic distances, on the other hand, ranged from18 to 22%. The pairwise comparisons showed that applying97% or more similarity as a clustering threshold will confidentlydiscriminate V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys. These resultsare consistent with the ABGD analysis in which the sequencesbelonging to V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys were assignedto well defined independent groups using an a priori definedgenetic threshold of 1%.DNA MetabarcodingThe quantity of the total DNA extracted from the sixteen herbalproducts varied between samples. Total DNA concentrationmeasurement gave detectable results for 15 of the samples(93.7%), with DNA concentrations ranging from 0.06 to87.32 ng/\u00b5l, and nrITS1 and nrITS2 amplicons were obtainedfor all these samples. One sample, marketed as a lozenge,did not yield a measurable DNA concentration and noamplicons of nrITS1 and nrITS2 were obtained from this sample(Supplementary Table S5).The raw data before demultiplexing consisted of 2,638,101sequences, with an average of 82,440 sequences per samplefor each marker. Sequencing was successful for thirteen herbalproducts (81.3%) for both nrITS1 and nrITS2 and they wereused for further analysis (Table 3). Three products, two herbalteas (5, 16) and the lozenge (14), did not yield reads or MOTUsafter applying the quality filtering criteria and were excluded fromfurther analyses.

The metabarcoding data is used for qualitative evaluationonly, to determine presence of identified taxa, and not forquantitative assessment of relative species abundance based onread numbers, as too many variables impact the values, such asthe availability of DNA that can be removed or degraded duringthe harvesting, drying, storage, transportation and processing(Bombardelli, 1991; Novak et al., 2007), as well as variation innrITS copy numbers, primer annealing and PCR amplificationbiases (Pawluczyk et al., 2015). Furthermore, incompletereference databases and incorrectly identified sequences inGenBank can impact taxonomic assignments.The choice of similarity clustering thresholds (>97, >99,and 100%) impacted the number and size of assigned MOTUs(Table 3). Setting the clustering threshold to 100% yielded1572 MOTUs, 99% yielded 824 MOTUs, and 97% yielded only287 MOTUs. The low number of MOTUs obtained using the97% clustering threshold is likely the result of multiple speciesbeing grouped together into the same MOTU as 3% divergencefar exceeds interspecific variation in many genera (Yang andRannala, 2017). Setting the clustering threshold to 100%, onthe other hand, likely resulted in more than one MOTU beingformed for a single taxonomic species as a result of infraspecificvariation and/or sequencing errors between reads. Here wefollowed previous studies in using a 99% clustering threshold(Ghorbani et al., 2016; Raclariu et al., 2017; Veldman et al.,2017). Furthermore, to limit the impact of sequencing errors,which are known to affect the Ion Torrent sequencing platform(Loman et al., 2012; Salipante et al., 2014) and which could leadto the formation of false MOTUs, we used only the clusters thatcontained a minimum 10 reads.The 824 MOTUs that were retained using a 99% similarityclustering threshold were further identified using BLAST as109 different species (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S6).Based on only nrITS1 we detected a total of 64 different speciesand on only nrITS2 61 species (Supplementary Table S6).Based on both markers, the number of species detected persample ranged from 2 to 32, with an average of 8 speciesper sample. Only two of the seven (28.6%) single ingredientsamples (those listing V. officinalis as the only ingredient)contained V. officinalis, three others contained V. chamaedrysand one contained other Veronica species, and all productscontained additional species, ranging from 1 to 21 speciesper product. None of the nine retained multiple ingredientsamples (i.e., those listing V. officinalis and other species on thelabel) contained only the listed ingredients, and none containedV. officinalis (Figure 1). The overall ingredient fidelity (detectedspecies from product label/total number of species on label)was 9.5% for the multiple ingredient products, and 17% for allproducts. The target species V. officinalis was detected in only2 products (15%), whereas V. chamaedrys was detected in eight(62%) of the retained samples. These results are supported bythe pairwise comparison of the genetic distances that showedthat V. officinalis could be unambiguously differentiated fromV. chamaedrys using standard arbitrary clustering thresholds(Supplementary Table S4). In sample 10 a mixture of severalVeronica species was detected, including V. bombycina Boiss.& Kotschy, V. filiformis Sm., V. pectinata, V. tenuifolia Asso,V. krumovii (Peev) Peev and V. chamaedrys. The presence ofthese species can be explained as substitutes, admixtures orcontaminants.

The size of circles corresponds to the relative abundance of the reads.allows up to 2% foreign matter, unless this is differently indicatedin a specific herb monograph (EDQM - Council of Europe,2014). Presence of these other Veronica species might not bein breach of the European Pharmacopoeia but it does indicatea lapse in the value chain of this product. The same appliesto the 62% products that contained V. chamaedrys instead ofV. officinalis.CONCLUSIONThis study used HPLC-MS and DNA metabarcoding toauthenticate and detect adulteration or admixture of V. officinaliswith V. chamaedrys in Veronica herbal products. HPLC-MS isuseful for qualitative and quantitative analysis of constituents inmedicinal plants and herbal products and its use has increased inrecent years (Steinmann and Ganzera, 2011; Bansal et al., 2014),but constraints are the expensive chemical reference standards(some of which are still unavailable for biologically activetarget components), sensitivity to the type of raw material andmanufacturing process, and lack of resolution in distinguishingplant species (Bansal et al., 2014). Our HPLC-MS results showthat distinction of V. officinalis from other Veronica speciesbased on the targeted iridoid glycosides, aucubin, catalpol,veronicoside, and catalposide is difficult in pure products, andimpossible in multiple ingredient products.

DNA Metabarcoding for Authentication of Veronica officinalis Productsof HPLC-MS to detect substitution and/or adulteration of highlyprocessed and multi-ingredient herbal products is challenging,and this is corroborated by our findings.Several authors have advocated the use of DNA barcodingand metabarcoding in herbal product authentication andpharmacovigilance (Coghlan et al., 2012; Newmaster et al.,2013; Cheng et al., 2014; De Boer et al., 2015; Palhares et al.,2015; Ivanova et al., 2016), due to its cost effectiveness andability to disclose plant species diversity within products. OurDNA metabarcoding results corroborate previous researchthat used metabarcoding to authenticate herbal products(Coghlan et al., 2012, 2015; Cheng et al., 2014; Ivanovaet al., 2016; Veldman et al., 2017). In this study we confirmits applicability to test for presence of V. officinalis andsimultaneously to detect substitution, adulteration and/oradmixture of other Veronica species. Using DNA metabarcodingwe found that only 15% of the products contained V. officinalis,whereas 62% of the products contained V. chamaedrys.Furthermore, we found that all the investigated herbalproducts contained other species not listed on the label.Limitations of DNA metabarcoding are its susceptibilityto various factors, such as quality, processing state andproduct type of the extracted material, as well as severalvariables related to the methodological framework, such asDNA extraction procedures, primers, markers, amplificationprotocols for the library preparation sequencing platform,filtering, quality thresholds and chimera removal, and clusteringthresholds.Despite limitations of the methodology, our DNAmetabarcoding results show that there is a need to study herbalproducts derived from traditional medicine, and to increaseconsumer confidence by advocating and promoting a higherstandard of quality in herbal products. In recent years, thescientific community has been showing an increasing interestin finding adequate and comprehensive methodologies toinvestigate such complex products, focusing on their entirevalue chain, from the raw material to the product on theshelf.SUPPORTING INFORMATIONIon-Torrent amplicon read data is deposited in DRYAD doi:10.5061/dryad.606ks.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSMI, HB, GC, and AR conceived the experiment.

Some animal and clinicalstudies reveal positive results in models of anxiety and depression although very littleresearch has been done on molecular mechanisms. Our work consisted of evaluatingthe effects of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil on central nervous systemwell-established targets, such as MAO-A, SERT, GABAAand NMDA receptors as wellas in vitro models of neurotoxicity. The results showed that lavender essential oil and itsmain components exert affinity for the glutamate NMDA-receptor in a dose-dependentmanner with an IC50 value of 0.04\u00b5l/mL for lavender oil. In addition, lavender and linaloolwere also able to bind the serotonin transporter (SERT) whereas they did not show affinityfor GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor. In three different models of neurotoxicity, lavenderdid not enhance the neurotoxic insult and improved viability of SH-SY5Y cells treated withhydrogen peroxide. According to our data, the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effectsattributed to lavender may be due to an antagonism on the NMDA-receptor and inhibitionof SERT. This study suggests that lavender essential oil may exert pharmacologicalproperties via modulating the NMDA receptor, the SERT as well as neurotoxicity inducedby hydrogen peroxide.Keywords: essential oils, central nervous system, lavender, Lavandula angustifolia, Lavandula officinalis, SH-SY5Ycells, glutamate receptorINTRODUCTIONEssential oils have a long tradition in pharmaceutical sciences as natural products withpharmacological, cosmetic, agrochemical and nutritional applications (Bakkali et al., 2008). Theuse of EO in form of aromatherapy or phytotherapy is widely extended, some of them beingused as agents to relieve anxiety and stress (Setzer, 2009). Phytotherapy consists of the use ofmedicinal plants in order to prevent, cure or threat illnesses. Aromatherapy can be understood asa subdivision of phytotherapy and defined as the use of essential oils regarding therapeutic effects.Abbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; LEO, lavender essential oil; GABA, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid; iGLURs, ionotropicglutamate receptors; MAO-A, monoamine oxidase A; NMDA, n-methyl-D-aspartate; SERT, serotonin transporter; SSRI,selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.347L\u00f3pez et al. Lavender Pharmacological MechanismsThese products have been used for centuries and are accepted intraditional or modern healthcare systems of medicine. Medicinalplants are widely used for the treatment of central nervous systemdisorders (Wheatley, 2005) but in some cases there is still lack ofpreclinical and clinical studies.Central nervous system disorders have a great impact insociety due to a general aging process of the population as wellas lifestyle. Stress is one of the most prevalent psychologicaldisorders in developed countries leading to other clinicalfeatures, such as anxiety, insomnia or depression.Benzodiazepines (BZD) and selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors (SSRIs) are highly prescribed as anxiolytic andantidepressant drugs, respectively. BZD, such as diazepam,lorazepam or alprazolam produce calming effects via bindingto GABAA receptors, but they may also produce somnolenceand cognitive impairment as adverse drug reactions. SSRIs(e.g., fluoxetin, paroxetin, citalopram) are prescribed asantidepressants because they are able to selectively block theserotonin transporter (SERT), but side effects include sexualdysfunction and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as suicidetendencies and sleep disorders. Both groups of medicines arealso involved in withdrawal and \u201crebound effects\u201d as a result ofdiscontinuing their administration.Certain EO are being used as anxiolytic remedies and theadministration mode can be orally but also by inhalation orcombined with massage. One of the most popular essentialoils for mental disorders and anxiety is lavender (Lavandulaangustifolia Miller or Lavandula officinalis Chaix). Lavenderessential oil can be considered as one of the best-seller overthe counter herbal remedies for anxiety, stress and depression.Studies reveal high content of linalool and linalyl acetate (DaPorto et al., 2009) and international organizations, such as theWorld Health Organization (WHO), the European ScientificCooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP) or the EuropeanMedicines Agency (EMA) approve this medicinal plant to relievestress, restlessness and anxiety (Community)1.The growing awareness of the adverse effects of centralnervous system drugs has led to develop new strategies andsafer pharmacological agents in mental health. Enzymes, suchas monoamine oxidase (MAO), proteins, such as the SERT andligand-gated ion channels, such as GABAA and NMDA receptorsare therapeutic targets in neuropharmacology. With the aim tocontribute to evidence-based herbal medicine we have studiedthe effects of lavender essential oil on pharmacological targetsinvolved in anxiolytic and antidepressive properties as well asin vitromodels of neurotoxicity.METHODSLavender Essential Oil (LEO) andChemicalsPure lavender (L. angustifolia) essential oil was kindly suppliedby Pranarom International (Belgium). Isolated monoterpenes(linalool, linalyl acetate) were purchased from Fluka.

Carrier gas:helium at 1.0ml/min. A NIST library was used for comparisonof MS data.Animals and Brain MembraneHomogenatesAdult male Sprague Dawley rats were obtained from Taconic(Denmark). Ethical permission for the studies was granted by theAnimalWelfare Committee, appointed by the DanishMinistry ofJustice, and all animal procedures were carried out in compliancewith the ECDirective 86/609/EEC and theDanish laws regulatingexperiments on animals. Rats were put down by competent staff,the heads were separated from the body and the brains wereremoved whereas cerebellum was discarded. The cortex wereweighed and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax using differentbuffers at 4\u25e6C and the tissue preparation in each case was carriedout as earlier described (Ransom and Stec, 1988). The tissuehomogenates were resuspended and stored in aliquots at \u221280\u25e6Cuntil use.Bioassays Regarding Serotonergic TargetsMonoamine Oxidase-A Inhibition (MAO-A Assay)The bioassay was performed in a 96-well microplate (Saabyet al., 2009). Each well contained 50\u00b5l of essential oil dilutionor DMSO as blank (making a final concentration in thewells of 0.002, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.1%), 50\u00b5l of chromogenicsolution (0.8mM vanillic acid, 417mM 4-aminoantipyrine and4 U/ml horseradish peroxidase in potassium phosphate bufferpH 7.6), 100\u00b5l of 3mM tyramine and 50\u00b5l of 8 U/ml MAO-A. Absorbance was read at 490 nm every 5min for 30min.Background interferences were deducted in the same waydescribed above but without MAO enzyme. Data was analyzedusingGraphPad Prism. IC50 values could not be obtained becausethe higest tested concentration did not reach 50% of MAOinhibition. Clorgyline was used as positive control.Serotonin Transporter Assay ([3H]-CitalopramBinding Assay)The assay was performed on the basis of themethod fromNielsenet al. (2004). 25\u00b5l of three different essential oil concentrationswere mixed with 50\u00b5l of 4 nM [3H]-Citalopram and 225\u00b5lof rat cortex suspension making a final concentration of theessential oils in the assay of 0.08, 0.4, and 0.8%. All componentswere previously dissolved in buffer (50mM Tris-base; 120mMNaCl: 5mM KCl at pH 7.5). Plastic tubes were placed on anFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 280348L\u00f3pez et al. Lavender Pharmacological Mechanismsice bath, the reagents were added and the tubes were mixedand then left at room temperature (approximately 22\u25e6C) for2 h. After incubation, 5ml of ice cold buffer were added tothe samples and they were filtered through GC-50 Advantecglass filters under vacuum and immediately washed once withadditional 5ml of ice cold buffer. Control test tubes (withbuffer instead of EO) and blind tubes (with 25\u00b5l of 120\u00b5Mparoxetine instead of EO) were done in every run in orderto determine total and unspecific binding. The amount ofradioactivity was determined transferring the glass filters intoscintillation tubes and adding 4ml of Ultimo Gold XR. Thescintillation tubes were placed in the dark for 30min beforethey were measured on a Tri-CARB 2100 TR analyzer. Threeindependent experiments were performed in triplicates. Non-radioactive citalopram was used as reference. Linalool and linalylacetate were tested. The specific binding of [3H]-citalopram wasdetermined using the formula: % binding = [dpm(essential oil)-dpm(unspecific binding)/dpm(total binding)-dpm(unspeficic binding)] \u00d7100.Bioassays on Ionotropic ReceptorsAffinity for GABAA Receptor ([3H]-Ro 15-1788Binding Assay)The membrane preparation was washed with ice-cold buffer(50mM Tris-citrate pH 7.1). The suspension was centrifuged at0\u20134\u25e6C for 10min at 27,000 \u00d7 g. The pellet was resuspended inTris-citrate buffer (2mg original tissue per ml) and used for theassay. 25\u00b5l of 3H-Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) was added to 25\u00b5lof test solutions (10, 1, and 0.1mg/ml) and 500\u00b5l of membranepreparation. Total and unspecific binding was measured usingbuffer or diazepam (1\u00b5M assay final concentration). Afterincubation for 40min in an ice bath, 5ml of ice-cold buffer wasadded to the samples and poured onto Adventic glass fiber filters(GC-50) under vacuum, and immediately washed with another5ml of ice-cold buffer. The amount of radioactivity of the filterswas measured by conventional liquid scintillation counting usingUltimo Gold XR as scintillation fluid. Clonazepam was used aspositive control.Affinity for NMDA Receptor ([3H]-CGP39653 BindingAssay)Affinity for native NMDA receptors was determined using 2 nM[3H]-CGP 39653 (Sills et al., 1991) with some modification. Onthe day of the assay, frozen membranes were quickly thawedand homogenized in 30 volumes of ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer,pH 7.4 (50mM containing 2.5mM CaCl2), and centrifuged(48,000 \u00d7 g for 10min). This step was repeated three times. Thefinal pellet was re-suspended in ice-cold buffer, correspondingto approximately 0.4\u20130.5mg protein/ml. Binding was carriedout in aliquots consisting of 25\u00b5L [3H]-CGP 39653, 25\u00b5L testsolution, and 200\u00b5L membrane suspension and incubated at 0\u25e6for 60min. Non-specific binding was determined using 1mM(S)-Glu. Binding was terminated by filtration through WhatmanGF/C filters using a 96-well Packard Filter-Mate Cell Harvesterand filters were washed with 3\u00d7 250 \u00b5L of ice-cold buffer. Afterdrying, 30\u00b5L Microscint 0 (Perkin-Elmer) per well was addedand the filter was counted on a Topcounter (Perkin-Elmer).Linalool and linalyl acetate were also tested in this assay.Neuroprotection on SH-SY5Y CellsSH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cell CultureCells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, ref. 41966-029) containingphenol red (PR), L-Glutamine (1mM) and sodium pyruvate(1mM) and was supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), penicillin(100 U/mL, Gibco) and streptomycin (100 U/mL, Gibco). Cellswere maintained at 37\u25e6C in saturated humidity (5% CO2). Non-differentiated cells were plated on 48-well plates (Corning), at adensity of 5\u00d7 104 cells per well and were used 48 h after seeding.A\u03b225\u201335SolubleSpecies PreparationA\u03b225\u201335fragment was purchased from Sigma-Aldrichlaboratories (ref. A4559-1MG). 1mg of A\u03b225\u201335 fragmentwas dissolved in 1mL of type II water and was frozen at -20\u25e6Cuntil further use. Different concentrations of A\u03b225\u201335 (5, 10and 15\u00b5M) were incubated in DMEM phenol red free (Gibco,31053-028) at 37\u25e6C for 3 days to obtain the oligomeric forms.Cell Treatment and MTT Cell Viability AssaySH-SY5Y cells were treated with either different LEOconcentration (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and1\u00b5L/mL) or incubationtime (0, 2, and 24 h), followed by hydrogen peroxide (100, 200,400, 800, and 1,600\u00b5M), malonate (0 or 50mM) or A\u03b225\u201335(5,10, and 15\u00b5M).Cell viability was examined by the 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MTT assayis a colorimetric assay for measuring the activity of cellularenzymes in living cells in response to potential toxic. After thecell treatment, culture medium was replaced by a solution of5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM (Gibco, 31053-028).Cells were incubated with MTT solution for 2 h in the cellincubator (5% CO2 and 37\u25e6C). Then, the MTT solution wasdiscarded and DMSO was added to the wells. Aliquots weretransferred to a 96-well plate, and absorbance was measured at595 nm in a plate reader. Results were expressed as percentagesof non-treated control cells.Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean \u00b1 SE (figures) or as mean \u00b1SD(tables) of at least three independent experiments performed indifferent days and in triplicates. GraphPad Prism was used tocalculate IC50 values and to detect significant differences. Studentt-test or ANOVA was performed for data analysis.RESULTSChemical Profile by GC-MSAccording to the GC-MS analyses, lavender essential oil mainlycontained the following monoterpenes: linalyl acetate (52.1%),linalool (37.4%), geranyl acetate (5.4%), and \u03b2-caryophyllene(5.1%).Monoamine Oxidase-A Inhibition (MAO-AAssay)Inhibition of MAO A was not detected (data not shown).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 280349L\u00f3pez et al.

LEO significantly displaced 3H-citalopramfrom binding to the SERT in a dose-dependent manner,which means that LEO might have an antidepressant-like effect via this specific transporter. This effect wasalso detected for linalool, one of the main constituentsof lavender essential oil (Figure 1), but not for linalylacetate.Affinity for GABAA Receptor ([3H]-Ro15-1788 Binding Assay)The affinity for the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor, whichmay lead to a nerve calming effect, was not detected (Table 1).LEO had no effect in binding this ionotropic receptor.Clonazepam (IC500.002 nM) was used as positive controldrug.FIGURE 2 | Affinity of lavender essential oil (A) and linalool and linalylacetate (B) for the glutamate NMDA receptor.

This essential oil is one of the best-selling natural remedies and a common therapeutic tool forphysiotherapists and chiropractors.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 280351L\u00f3pez et al. Lavender Pharmacological MechanismsFIGURE 5 | Effect of 1\u00b5l/ml lavender essential oil (LEO) onbeta-amyloid induced toxicity on SH-SY5Y cells at 0 (A), 2 (B), and 24 h(C). **p < 0.01 vs. 15\u00b5M beta-amyloid (medium only).There has recently been an increase in the use of naturaltherapies due to well-known side effects of common CNS drugs,such as (BZD) and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors(SSRI). Although BZD and SSRI have been widely usedin neuropharmacology, there is a need of developing newtherapeutic tools that play a role both in prevention andtreatment of mild CNS disorders.In this sense, aromatherapy and some essentials oils have beenused for decades to induce nerve-calming effects and mood-enhancing properties (Dobetsberger and Buchbauer, 2011).Aromatherapy is a form of complementary and alternativemedicine (CAM) that uses plant essentials oils to affect the moodor health of the patient (Wheatley, 2005) and some clinicalstudies suggest that inhaled or topically applied essential oilslike lavender exert psychological and central nervous systemeffects (Perry and Perry, 2006). It has also recently been statedthat essential oils may behave as antidepressants due to playingan important role on neurotransmitter pathways, mainly in theserotonin system (Lv et al., 2013).Certain studies have reported pharmacological propertiesof essential oils but there is little research on the molecularmechanisms underlying the CNS effects. The ability of lavenderessential oil to interact with neuropharmacological targets, suchas MAO-A, the SERT and ionotropic receptors (GABAA andNMDA) has been tested, as well as the protective potential againstneurotoxic agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, malonate andamyloid peptide.It was surprising that LEO had the capacity to bindto the NMDA receptor, which was measured through theCGP39653 binding assay. CGP39653 is a competitive antagonist,being currently the ligand of choice for labeling NMDAreceptors. NMDA receptors are neurochemically classified asionotropic glutamate receptors (iGLURs) and are involved incertain neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy,sustained-seizure damage, Parkinsonism, etc. For this reasoniGLURs are considered pharmacological targets in drug researchand development. LEO was able to displace CGP39653 bindingin a dose-dependent mode, which means that this oil may exertnerve-calming effects via modulating NMDA receptors. This isthe first time that this affinity is reported and this fact couldexplain the anti-agitation properties that have been found forthese products in animal and some clinical studies (Bradley et al.,2009; Faturi et al., 2010; Kasper et al., 2010; Tsang and Ho,2010; Woelk and Schlaefke, 2010; Chioca et al., 2011; Goes et al.,2012; Hritcu et al., 2012; Schuwald et al., 2013). NMDA-receptoractivation by glutamate is also involved in neurotoxicity so ouressential oil might exert neuroprotection through the blockade ofthis ionotropic receptor.According to our data, these results are in the range of othernatural products that have been reported to show activity in thistarget (Cho et al., 2001; Pedersen et al., 2008; Marchetti et al.,2011).Lavender essential oil has shown activity in animal andhuman studies but according to Koulivand et al. (2013), due tomethodological inadequacies, small sample sizes, variations onadministration methods or the absence of placebos or controlgroups in the studies, more standard experiments are needed toconfirm the benefits of lavender in CNS disorders. The molecularmechanisms involved in lavender effects have been suggestedin other studies. For example, Huang et al. (2009) suggestthat lavender essential oil reversibly inhibited GABA-inducedcurrents in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01\u20131 mg/mL),whereas no inhibition of NMDA- or AMPA-induced currentswas noted. In a recent study, Schuwald et al. (2013) identified astandarized lavender essential oil (Silexan) as a potent anxiolyticinhibiting voltage dependent calcium channels in synaptosomes,primary hippocampal neurons and stably overexpressing celllines, in the same range as pregabaline.Lavender essential oil is known to contain monoterpenes likelinalool and linalyl acetate, which seem to be responsible for theactivity according to our data and previous works (Cline et al.,2008; Linck et al., 2010; Souto-Maior et al., 2011). The capacity oflinalool to interact with the glutamatergic system and the NMDAreceptor is not new as it has been previously described by otherFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 280352L\u00f3pez et al. Lavender Pharmacological Mechanismsauthors (Elisabetsky et al., 1995, 1999; Silva Brum et al., 2001;Aprotosoaie et al., 2014); however, the ability of linalyl acetateto bind the NMDA receptor has not been found to be reportedin previous works. It seems that lavender essential oil anxiolyticeffects is due to the fact that its main monoterpenes, linalool andlinalyl acetate, interact with the NMDA receptor.It is very difficult to establish structure activity relationshipsbecause linalyl acetate was inactive in the SERT assay, whereas theactivity of this compound was slightly higher than linalool in theNMDA binding receptor assay. Linalool and linalyl acetate aresecondary metabolites classified as monoterpenes with a similarstructure consisting of a linear hydrocarbon chain of 10 carbons(linalool) or 11 (linalyl acetate), being linalyl acetate the esterof linalool. The free hydroxyl group in linalool seems to bedeterminant for the activity in the SERT. On the contrary, theactivity on the NMDA receptor is increased when the acetategroup exists in the compound named linalyl acetate; limonene,another monoterpenic compound found at high concentrationin Citrus essential oils, has also shown anxiolytic-like activitywith other targets involved (de Almeida et al., 2012; Lima et al.,2013).Other essential oils have been demonstrated to producechanges in brain neurotransmitters which could explain its anti-agitation properties. For example, ylang-ylang (Cananga odorata)essential oil has shown anxiolytic effects in male mice decreasingthe dopamine concentration in the striatum and increasing theserotonin concentration in the hippocampus (Zhang et al., 2016).Surprisingly, linalool is one of the main components of thisessential oil. The essential oils obtained from Eugenia uniflora hasalso demonstrated antidepressant-like activities in animal modelswith the serotonergic and adrenergic systems being involved(Victoria et al., 2013). Melissa officinalis essential oil, which isalso used as a natural sedative, has demonstrated a depressanteffect on neurotransmission but no inhibition of NMDA- orAMPA-induced currents was detected (Abuhamdah et al., 2008).Citrus aurantifolia (bitter orange) essential oil has also exhibitedanxiolytic-like effects mediated by 5-HT(1A)-receptors (Costaet al., 2013). All these works put forward the idea that theserotonergic system is involved in the nerve calming effects ofessential oils.We have also observed that lavender and linalool inhibitsserotonergic targets, such as the SERT, which might explain whylavender has shown antidepressant-like effects in animal andhuman models (Cavanagh and Wilkinson, 2002; Akhondzadeshet al., 2003; Hritcu et al., 2012). However, we did not observeeffects on the GABAA-receptor, which is in accordance withresults from a recent study (Chioca et al., 2013).This study has been completed using neuroblasts from neuralhuman tissue (SH-SY5Y) exposed to different neurotoxic agents.Lavender was able to protect the cells from the toxic insultgenerated by hydrogen peroxide although it was not capableto reduce malonate toxicity. Results from amyloid-\u03b2 peptideinduced toxicity are not conclusive. However, this activity seemsto be in accordance with a previous study where lavenderessential oil showed neuroprotective properties against hydrogenperoxide induced toxicity in PC12 cells (Xu et al., 2016). Theauthors conclude that lavender protected the cells reducing LDH,NO release, intracellular ROS accumulation and MMP loss.CONCLUSIONOur study reveals for the first time that lavender exerts receptorbinding affinities with a relevant activity on the NMDA receptor.According to our data, we can state that the anti-agitation andantidepressant activities of lavender may be attributed at least inpart to the NMDA receptor modulation as well as an inhibitionof the SERT. Lavender essential oil also protected SH-SY5Y cellsfrom hydrogen peroxide induced neurotoxicity.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSVL conceived the study, performed in vitro pharmacologicalactivities (enzyme inhibition tests, affinities to receptors andtransporters), carried out data analysis and wrote themanuscript.BN run the NMDA activity assay.
