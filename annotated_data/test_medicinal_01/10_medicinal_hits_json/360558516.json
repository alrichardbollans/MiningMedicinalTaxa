Gathering wild herbs has, however, been \nreplaced today by the many products on the shelves of health stores and pharmacies in \ndeveloped countries with health systems similar to New Zealand.  Previous studies of \nsupplements and their use have largely focused on how many people use them, or subsumed \nsupplement use within wider studies of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).  \nSupplement use, however, has characteristics that make it different from CAM therapies more \nbroadly.  Yet there have been only a few investigations where supplement users have been \nasked directly about their practices, and those that have been done have tended to be under-\ntheorised and so lack depth.  \nThis study used a constructionist approach, within which supplements and their users were \nexamined from both humanist and post-humanist perspectives. I used semi-structured \ninterviews to generate data with 36 participants who were regular users of supplements. The \ninterviews were supplemented by observations of the displays of products that participants \nbrought to my attention in the home and retail settings where the interviews took place.  A \ncritical theoretical analysis was undertaken, framed by Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s concept of the \nrhizomatic assemblage of multiple, interconnected actants which are always in a process of \nchange. Within this wider framework, aspects of the data were examined using other theoretical \nconcepts including deconstruction, the agency of matter, and Foucault\u2019s ideas of power and \ncaring for the self.  \nThe study revealed that popular assumptions about supplements as being natural, holistic and \nrisk free can be deconstructed to show a wide variety of nuances and competing interpretations. \nMaterial things are significant in supplement use; not only the products themselves but the non-\nhuman communication technologies that allow individuals and companies the means to \nresearch, promote, sell or buy supplements when and where they choose across the globe. \nUsing the experience and new knowledge acquired through these non-human things, \nsupplement users become confident in their ability to resist over-scrutiny of their practices by \nthe orthodox health system and this confidence becomes woven in to how they present \nthemselves and their life story.     \nii \n \n \nI conclude the study by drawing on Barad\u2019s work on intra-action and agential realism.  These \nconcepts show supplement practices to be a simultaneous production of human and non-human \nagency, with each affecting and being affected by the other.  Each time a product is sold, bought \nor ingested can be understood as a temporary event that entangles meaning and matter at one \nmoment in time.  Yet within the passing event, enacted through the physical piece of matter, \nmany social, cultural and economic effects are contained, as well as the personal meanings of \nthe individual user and their hopes for the future. There is also a ritual element to these events, \nsymbolising the user\u2019s expectation that they can keep the disruption of ill health and injury away \nand so preserve their capacity to pursue the ongoing quest for what makes life meaningful for \nthem.  \n \n  \niii \n \n \nTable of contents \n \nAbstract 1 \nTable of contents 3 \nAcknowledgements 5 \nPreface 6 \nChapter 1: Introduction 7 \nScope of the study 7 \nPrevious studies of supplements 9 \nResearch gaps 15 \nStructure of the thesis 18 \nChapter 2: Ingested substances: ancient and modern 20 \nLegends and literature 20 \nTraditional medicines 24 \nThe beginnings of professional and \u2018alternative\u2019 health care 28 \nInformal home remedies in colonial New Zealand 29 \nThe persistence of home remedies into the mid-20th century 31 \nChapter 3: Methodology and methods 33 \nIntroduction 33 \nEpistemological approach 33 \nReflexivity 36 \nMethods 38 \nThe sample 40 \nEthical approval and M\u0101ori consultation 43 \nThe interview process 44 \nAnalytical approach 45 \nTheoretical framing 48 \nChapter 4: Natural, holistic and safe: deconstructing discourses about supplements 51 \nIntroduction 51 \nNature and naturalness 54 \nHow natural is \u2018natural\u2019? 57 \nThe evolving assemblage of the natural: traditional, exotic, novel, ethical 60 \nHolism and holistic health 68 \nBalance and uniqueness of the person 71 \niv \n \n \nThe desire for wholeness 75 \nSafety from risk: the body under siege 80 \nRepelling external invaders 83 \nThe quiet invader within 87 \nConclusion 94 \nChapter 5: Supplements as lively matter: the importance of material things 96 \nIntroduction 96 \nThe power of the material product 100 \nThings for the body and mind 103 \nThings for the spirit 110 \nThings in the evolving assemblage 119 \nInterconnecting things 123 \nMarketing things 130 \nConclusion 140 \nChapter 6: Supplements: through responsibility and expertise to power 142 \nIntroduction 142 \nBeing a responsible citizen 145 \nReconfiguring responsibility: supplement users 148 \nReconfiguring responsibility: as a supplement seller 155 \nBecoming your own expert 157 \nBecoming expert enough to advise others 167 \nSupplements and evolving identity 173 \nConclusion 179 \nChapter 7:  Discussion 181 \nSupplement practices: the intra-action of discourse, materiality and power 181 \nSupplement practices: entangled phenomena 185 \nMeaning, matter, ritual and symbolism 190 \nReferences 198 \nAppendices 265 \nAppendix A:  Information sheet for supplement users 265 \nAppendix B:  Consent form for supplement users to participate 268 \nAppendix C: Information sheet for supplement seller participants 270 \nAppendix D:  Consent form for supplement sellers participants 273 \nAppendix E: interview guides 275 \n \nv \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nMy grateful thanks to all the participants without whom the study could never have taken place.  \nAll of them shared their experiences generously, allowing me insights into difficult times in their \nlives and how they had coped with them.  Many of them welcomed me into their homes and \ntreated me hospitably with warmth and openness.  The insights they provided from their life \nstories will never leave me.   \nI want to record my deep gratitude for the thorough, consistent and patient help I received \nthroughout from my wonderful supervisors.  They read through draft after draft and provided \ninsightful comments every time, guiding me where I needed improvement, steering me through \nthickets of theory and preventing me from despair on the one hand, or enthusiastically setting \noff down irrelevant \u2018rabbit holes\u2019 on the other.  I owe more than words can say to their \nmentoring.   \nI also thank my family, especially my wonderful husband Vince Bidwell who, as ever, was a rock \nof stability and quiet support throughout, my four adult children and two grandchildren.  \nBetween them they variously provided encouragement, entertainment or diversions that kept \nme on track and allowed me to retain perspective about the most important things of life.  \nSpecial thanks to go to Simon and Cecilia for reading and commenting on some of the draft \nchapters, to Vince for proof reading the final draft, to Alex for creating the word cloud in Chapter \n5 and to my dear friend Chris for pointing me to the lesser known mythological sources in the \nbackground chapter.  I also thank my good friends Kristi, Sarah, Chidimma, Sandra, Ann and \nYvonne for sticking with me over all these years of study and always taking an interest in my \nprogress.    \nThanks also to the other students and staff of the Department of Population Health University of \nOtago, Christchurch for all the useful conversations over encounters in the kitchen and to my \nlovely colleagues at Pegasus Health for their encouragement and support throughout.  Special \nthanks to Jen Williams for her advice and assistance on the details of formatting. \nI also acknowledge the assistance of the administrative staff members of the Department of \nPopulation Health University of Otago, Christchurch including Katrina, Fran, Bernadette and \nSusannah and the IT assistance provided by Anna Young in sorting out time consuming issues \nrelated to systems and access of which there were many during the years the thesis was written. \nvi \n \n \nPreface \n \nIn 2013 I was a co-investigator in a piece of research where we were interviewing community \npharmacists.  For their convenience, most of the interviews took place in their pharmacies, and \nas we waited for them to become free to talk to us, I had more time than ever before to observe \nthe pharmacy space.  I could not help but notice the large displays of dietary supplements and \nherbal medicines that usually took up one whole wall of the pharmacy with the sign \u2018Natural \nHealth\u2019 above them.  Judging by the proportion of space they took up, it seemed that these \nproducts represented an important part of the business transacted in the pharmacy.  Our \nresearch questions focused on the advice that pharmacists gave people about their prescribed \nmedicines as well as other health advice they provided to general enquiries from the public who \ncame to the pharmacy.  In the course of our interview we would ask, gesturing at the wall of \n\u2018Natural Health\u2019, \u201cWhat about these other things you sell?\u201d  \nMy interest was sparked when we found the pharmacists seemed reluctant to discuss these \nproducts.  They tended to give us a somewhat defensive standard answer, namely, that the \nproducts were not evidence-based, but \u2018our customers\u2019 ask for them, and as they needed to \nmaintain a viable business, their role was to ensure they stocked high quality, safe products with \naccurate labelling.    I became curious after hearing this response several times and decided to \ntake a look at the literature for myself to see why they were so popular, yet the pharmacists \ntreated them with such apparent caution.  If they were not evidence-based, then why were so \nmany of them for sale?  What I found only made me more curious.  Sales of such products had \nbeen increasing steadily over the years in all Western countries.  The market in them was now \nworth many billions every year and still growing.  However, they were frowned on by medical \nprofessionals and considered to be either ineffective and a waste of money, or, on the other \nhand, to be putting people at risk from contaminated ingredients or interaction with prescribed \nmedicines.  There seemed to be only a few studies where investigators had spoken directly to \nusers of these products.  Here, I concluded was a topic that was begging for further \ninvestigation.  This thesis is the account of what I discovered.  \n7 \n \n \nChapter 1: Introduction \nScope of the study \nI set out to investigate how the people who buy and use the products I had seen in the \npharmacies discussed why they had come to use them and how they made sense of their \nexperiences.  \u2018Natural health,\u2019 the description above the products I had seen in the pharmacies, \nis an interesting juxtaposition that manages to sound succinct and yet vaguely intriguing at the \nsame time.  It is a skillful commercial phrase that suggests to the unwell that they may buy \nhealth, and it will be the \u2018natural\u2019 kind rather than the medicines in the dispensary that are \nassociated with illness.  At the same time it hints to those who feel completely healthy now, that \nthey could perhaps be even healthier, or store up some extra health for the future in a \u2018natural\u2019 \nway.  Yet the language used is belied by the appearance of the products themselves which are \nclearly a product of human, not natural, provenance, showing every sign of being mass produced \nand packaged up, their contents hidden away behind layers of plastic and cardboard.   \nTo refine the scope of my study I began by researching what had already been written about the \nproducts which are sold under the banner of \u2018natural health\u2019.  For simplicity, I will use the term \nsupplements throughout the thesis to refer to them, though strictly speaking they cover both \ndietary supplements and herbal medicines, as well as combinations of both.  Defining exactly \nwhat can be called a supplement is not exact as the vocabulary tends to be vague and all-\nencompassing.  The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), often used as a standard in medical \npublications, define dietary supplements as \u201cproducts in capsule, tablet, or liquid form that \nprovide dietary ingredients that are intended to be taken by mouth to increase the intake of \nnutrients.  Dietary supplements can include macronutrients such as proteins, carbohydrates and \nfats, and/or micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals.\u201d  The New Zealand \nAdult Nutrition Survey (Ministry of Health, 2009) took a different approach, carefully avoiding  \nbeing limited to nutrient intake alone.  Instead, the survey asked respondents about their use of \nmore specific categories of products: vitamins, minerals, oils, botanicals, bee products, animal \nand fish extracts, enzymes, and sports supplements.  The New Zealand definition has been used \nfor this study both for its local relevance and for its broader implications across the potential for \nboth nutritional and medicinal supplement use.   \nWhen deciding what to include in my study, it was clear that in order to keep it within achievable \nlimits I would need to exclude some areas as they were topics in their own right.  My interest \n8 \n \n \nhad originated in pharmacies from my previous research and was directly related to the use of \nsupplements for medicinal purposes, to improve or maintain health.  I decided early on \ntherefore, that I would exclude sports supplements and protein powders.  I also excluded \nsubstances prepared individually for Chinese medical herbalism and acupuncture and other \nsimilar products that were not commercially packaged for sale on the general retail market. \nSimilarly I excluded consideration of \u2018functional foods\u2019 (Landstrom et al., 2007) which, it might \nbe argued, cross over with the definition I adopted.  It is important to note here, too, that I was \nnot aiming to examine anything to do with the biomedical effectiveness of supplements, \n(whether they \u2018work\u2019 or not) or answer the criticisms of supplements and their users that have \nbeen put forward in the medical literature.  While these issues have been touched on where the \nparticipants raised them, they were not the focus of the study.  \nOne of the first issues that becomes apparent when researching why people might use \nsupplements, is that these products are very often treated as just another one of the different \ntherapies within complementary and alternative medicine or CAM.  CAM includes, according to \nErnst and Singh (2008), everything that orthodox medicine considers falls outside what orthodox \nmedicine does. This bundling together under one umbrella term of the \u201cthe vast range of \nparadigmatically different therapies\u201d (Lewis, 2019: 843) is a common approach, even among \nqualitative studies which have examined the reasons why people may be drawn to seeking \nhealth care outside orthodox medicine (for example, Doel & Segrott, 2003; Stoneman et al., \n2013).  Supplements, however, have particular characteristics that set them apart from other \nCAM therapies. Unlike modalities such as chiropractic, acupuncture, reiki and homeopathy, they \ndo not require mediation through a therapist.  Individuals can buy and take products solely on \ntheir own initiative without consulting anyone else.  Even if they do seek advice or are provided \nwith products by a pharmacist, herbalist or other therapist, the consumption of the products is \nan unsupervised, solo act. It is completely under the control of the individual, can be started or \nstopped at any time and is not recorded as a medication that may be checked on for adherence \nby a doctor or pharmacist.  Secondly, supplements as a category are not supported by an overall \ntheory of practice, as, for example, are homeopathy or acupuncture, both of which draw from \nunderlying principles which set out how they are believed to work.  Thirdly, the term \n\u2018supplements\u2019 collapses widely different categories of substances under the one collective \nsignifier.  A supplement can be anything from a single vitamin, mineral or herb or any of the \nother individual substances mentioned in the list above or it can be one of the seemingly endless \nnumber of combinations of two or more of these (Marcus, 2016). These differences from other \n9 \n \n \nCAM therapies make a sound case for investigating supplements and the people who use them \nas a topic in their own right.   \nResearch questions \nMy research questions therefore were:  \nHow do people who use or sell supplements explain why they came to engage with them \ninitially? \nHow do people who use or sell supplements describe and make sense of their experiences with \nsupplements?  \nTo put the study of supplements in a wider context, however, it is useful to briefly outline what \nthe academic literature has to say about them.    \nPrevious studies of supplements   \nIt is well established that supplements and herbal products are widely used in developed \ncountries with health systems similar to New Zealand\u2019s.  National surveys of the general public \nhave been carried out in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand (Bates \net al., undated; Gahche et al., 2011; University of Otago and Ministry of Health, 2011; \nVatanparast et al., 2010)  as well as large studies in Australia and Sweden (Brownie & Rolfe, \n2004; Messerer et al., 2001). The percentage of adults reporting supplement use in these studies \nranged from 52% in the United States, to 33% percent in Sweden with the other countries in \nbetween. The New Zealand Nutrition Study (Ministry of Health 2009) found that 30.7% of \nrespondents were regular users and a further 16.9% were occasional users. While it is not easy \nto compare countries, as surveys may be done infrequently, the use of supplements appears to \nbe increasing.  The Council for Responsible Nutrition in the United States (CRN, 2018) reported \nthat 75% of all adults surveyed used dietary supplements, up 10% from their previous survey in \n2009. This is an industry, not government organisation so needs to be treated accordingly, \nhowever their data are considered reliable by other academic investigators (Dickinson et al., \n2014). The New Zealand survey (Ministry of Health 2009) is now ten years old and has not been \nrepeated but recent reports in the New Zealand media, based on a health insurance company \nsurvey, found that 35% of those surveyed were regular users, also suggesting an increase (New \nZealand Herald, 2015). One measure of growing use is the amount of interest and attention paid \nto dietary supplements by the business media.  International reports confirm that the appetite \nfrom the global public for these products is high and continues to grow (Persistence Market \n10 \n \n \nResearch, 2017).  According to Lewis (2019), in 2016 in Australia alone, herbal and nutritional \nsupplements were a $4.2 billion industry.   One market research company has estimated that the \nglobal supplement market will be worth in excess of $220 billion by 2024 (Grand View Research, \n2018).   \nAnalysis of the demographic information collected in both large national surveys and smaller \nstudies tends to be consistent in showing that women use more dietary supplements than men, \nand older people, particularly those with chronic diseases such as arthritis, use more than those \nwho are younger (Hirayama et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2011; Murphy et al., 2011; Ried, 2016). \nMarket research companies also mention pregnant women, infants and children, and older \nadults as key markets for these products (Grand View Research, 2018).  Socio-economic factors \nappear to influence use; an analysis of data  by Statistics Canada (Vatanparast et al., 2010) found \nthat a higher household income and higher level of education were positively associated with \nvitamin and mineral supplement use.  In New Zealand, use of dietary supplements was lowest \namong the least well off with regular use around 10% lower than other groups.  However, those \nin the middle three quintiles by socio-economic status used more supplements than the those \nwith the highest household income (University of Otago and Ministry of Health, 2011).   \nSome surveys have also included questions about reasons for use.  Analysis of the data from the \n2007-2010 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that adults most \ncommonly reported that they took supplements to improve or maintain overall health (Bailey et \nal., 2013; Cardini et al., 2010; Dickinson et al., 2014). Perceptions that herbal medicines were \nnatural and less harmful than prescription drugs were reported in a number of investigations \n(Durante et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2006).  Several smaller surveys have looked at supplement \nuse by people who are being treated for cancer or who are cancer survivors (Damery et al., \n2011; Ma et al., 2011; Saquib et al., 2011). There are also many surveys of people with a \nparticular condition (for example, tart cherry juice to relieve gout (Singh et al., 2015)), but these \nare narrowly focused rather than relating to general supplement use.    \nThere is considerable commentary on supplement use in the academic medical literature, much \nof which notes the lack of evidence of biomedical effectiveness of supplements. The phrase \n\u201cexpensive urine and little else\u201d (Binns et al., 2018: 413) tends to be used in the literature \nlamenting the futility of taking supplements. They have been described as \u201cpseudoscience and \nnonsense\u201d (Lewis, 2019: 840) or the \u201cprovince of modern day Humpty Dumptys\u201d(Freeman, \n2005: 155).  \u2018Alternatives\u2019 that is, anything not accepted by orthodox medicine, are considered \nto be ineffective (Ernst & Singh, 2008) and their use to be regrettable and even dangerous.  \n11 \n \n \nCases have been reported where supplements have been contaminated with harmful substances \n(Genuis et al., 2012; Geyer et al., 2008; Maughan, 2005; Stickel et al., 2009), or caused \ninteractions with prescribed medicines (Fugh-Berman, 2000; Izzo, 2004; Sarino et al., 2007). \nOther investigations have reported poor communication between supplement users and health \nprofessionals and recommended that hospital and family physicians need to question patients \nmore closely because people tend not to disclose what they are taking to their health \nprofessionals (Ben-Arye et al., 2017; Gardiner et al., 2015; Tarn et al., 2014)et al 2014).  A \nnumber of researchers have looked at issues related to regulation, particularly the intricacies of \nthe United States Dietary Supplements Health Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, its strengths and \nweaknesses, issues of enforcement, and the loopholes that marketing companies have been able \nto exploit (Cooper, 2010; Noonan & Patrick Noonan, 2006; Onel, 2005; Temple, 2010). Several \nstudies have examined websites that promote dietary supplements for their compliance with \nthe Act (Dennehy et al., 2005; Jordan & Haywood, 2007; Morris & Avorn, 2003) and have \nrecorded concerns about those that do not mention adverse effects or interactions in their \npromotional material. A Canadian study took a different approach, speaking directly to key \ninformants from 20 companies about their intention to comply with the Canadian Natural Health \nProducts (NHP) regulations of 2004 (Laeeque et al., 2006).   \nInvestigations of the advice provided by pharmacists and health food stores to customers have \nfound a lack of emphasis on safety and interactions with prescribed medicines, \nrecommendations for products which were contraindicated in pregnancy, and recommending \ncostly products judged to be unsupported by evidence (Buckner et al., 2005; Mills et al., 2003).  \nPharmacies were generally found to give more reliable advice than health stores (Jefferies et al., \n2012; Sarino et al., 2007; Temple et al., 2009), but even so their advice was found to frequently \nbe inadequate, particularly at identifying potentially serious interactions (Sarino et al., 2007; \nWaddington et al., 2015). Pharmacists, for their part, have long maintained that, while they are \nstrongly supportive of their role in advising the public about supplements, they feel poorly \nequipped to do so and in need of further training (Howard et al., 2001; Kemper et al., 2003; \nKwan et al., 2006; Zeolla & Cerulli, 2008). Two systematic reviews ten years apart (Boon et al., \n2009; Ung et al., 2017) investigated pharmacist knowledge about supplements. Both reported \nthe expectations placed on pharmacists that they would know about supplements and provide \nwell-informed advice, yet they did not have the training to do so and lacked guidance on the \nscope of their responsibilities.  Many of these studies concluded by calling for stronger \nregulation of supplements unless under the guidance of a doctor (Dwyer et al., 2018; Starr, \n12 \n \n \n2015). However, the limited number of studies that have investigated the knowledge of medical \nprofessionals about supplements found that they too needed to be better informed so as to \nhave the knowledge and confidence to discuss supplement use with patients (Kemper et al., \n2006; Ventola, 2010).   \nThere appear to be few articles in the health literature on the marketing of supplements, an \nexception being a small study of Taiwanese students (Wu et al., 2012) examining the role of \nendorsements, framing and rewards on the effectiveness of dietary supplement advertisements.  \nCommentary and opinion in the health marketing literature itself (Cunningham, 2001; LaPenna, \n2010; Tanaka & Blatman, 2010) has tended to discuss how to frame their products in a positive \nlight, partner with health organisations, and offset negative publicity about supplements from \nhealth professionals.   It also features success stories, for example a report of a consumer \nwebsite campaign which had promoted supplements as one of \u201cthree pillars\u201d of health and \nwellness (healthy diet, exercise, and supplements) (LaPenna, 2010).  It is interesting to note the \ndiscrepancy between the marketing literature which tends to target affluent, middle-aged \nwomen, with a good education (Cunningham, 2001) as a primary user group, in contrast to the \nframing of supplement users in the health literature as being  poorly educated, having no \nunderstanding of science and as being duped by marketing claims into wasting money on \nineffective products and are lining the pockets of the companies that market them (Lewis, 2019; \nMorris & Avorn, 2003; Stoneman et al., 2013; Temple, 2010). \nThere have been some qualitative investigations where supplement users have been \ninterviewed in more depth about their practices. These studies have reported that users \nbelieved supplements were more natural and therefore safer than prescribed medicines, were \neffective for some ailments, helped to prevent chronic disease, gave them peace of mind, \nsupplemented a poor diet, and saved money on health care (Eliason et al., 1999; Peters et al., \n2003; Thompson & Nichter, 2007; Vickers et al., 2006).  Women with diabetes were found to be \nfocused on preventing or lessening diabetic complications (Oldham et al., 2004), and cancer \npatients to be motivated by the desire to support their immune system and to offset the effect \nof conventional drugs that they were taking for their illness (Haddon, 2001; Hok et al., 2011; \nHumpel & Jones, 2006; Paul et al., 2013).  \nThe qualitative studies also showed that though supplement users appear to be aware of the \nrisks publicised in the medical literature, rather than deterring them, it was more likely to \ndiscourage them from sharing information about what they take with their doctor.  Participants \nwere reported as saying they believed their doctors would disapprove and, even if they did not \n13 \n \n \nactively oppose their use, were poorly informed about supplements and lacked the ability to \nprovide clear guidance about them (Chang & Wang, 2009; Eliason et al., 1999; Peters et al., \n2003; Reedy et al., 2005; Vickers et al., 2006). Participants in these studies tended to believe \nthey were more knowledgeable than their doctor about their supplements and were sceptical \nabout the reliance that conventional medicine placed on clinical trial evidence as the standard \nfor proving effectiveness.  They noted, for example, that trials did not take place in real world \nconditions and they cited instances where trial data had later been proved wrong or the drugs \nhad led to unexpected adverse events (Little, 2009; Thompson & Nichter, 2007).  Instead, \nsupplement users drew their information from friends and family members, social networks,  all \ntypes of public media, and conducting their own internet research including accessing scientific \npapers (Humpel & Jones, 2006; Oldham et al., 2004; Peters et al., 2003; Sekhri & Kaur, 2014; \nThompson & Nichter, 2007).   \nInvestigations of herbalism and naturopathy have a degree of commonality with studies of \nsupplement use, as ingested products form a key part of the treatment offered in those \nmodalities. There is a limited body of literature, however, that has examined naturopathy or \nherbalism independently of other CAM treatments (Zick et al., 2009), and within it, only a few \nstudies appear to have directed their attention to the substances used. One example that does \nfocus on the products was a study of traditional herbal remedies from the Andes used by 40 \nPeruvian and Bolivian immigrants living in London (Ceuterick & Vandebroek, 2017).  Three \ndistinctive but overlapping positions in the way the participants made sense of their practices \nwere identified. They connected the participants to their home country, to their traditions and \ntherefore to their identity.  They also served as a means of coping for those who were not doing \nwell in their new location, were economically marginalised and struggling to access orthodox \nhealth care.  In contrast, they were also put to use as a way for these immigrants to demonstrate \nthat their practices were in keeping with currently popular discourses in their new country; that \nthey were health conscious consumers who preferred natural products and wished to avoid the \nside effects of pharmaceuticals.  \nSimilar studies of Ukranians living in the United States and Koreans in Australia, have found that \nlinks to traditional knowledge played a large part in their choice to use herbal therapists and \nremedies, though often they relied on home-prepared rather than commercially marketed \nproducts (Franic & Kleyman, 2012; Han, 2001). Concepts of identity and tradition in users of \nherbalism and naturopathy were also identified in naturopathy practitioners and clients in rural \nareas of Australia (Wardle et al., 2010).  This study concluded that country people had an \n14 \n \n \nenduring affinity with familiar natural substances which had always been part of their lives and \nwere likely to maintain traditional knowledge and remedies that had been passed down to them \nfrom previous generations. These notions of tradition and identity cross over with independent \nsupplement use (Bignante & Tecco, 2013), where people make decisions about caring for health \nthat draw on knowledge and remedies passed down to the current generation from their \nmothers, grandmothers and others, mostly women, in their families (Thompson & Nichter, \n2007).    \nEven though they may use some of the same products, herbalism and naturopathy are \nnevertheless very different from self-prescribed over-the-counter supplement use.  The formal \nmodalities are whole systems of healing, underpinned by bodies of theory and practice which \nguide practitioners\u2019 decisions about prescribing and advising their clients.  Herbalism has a \nnumber of different approaches depending on the framework within which herbal products are \nused as a source of healing.  These include bodies of traditional knowledge, such as Native \nAmerican or M\u0101ori healing, broader philosophical approaches within Ayurvedic, Chinese or \nTibetan systems that integrate herbal medicine into mental and physical practices, and Western \nherbal medicine based on traditions that arise from European thought (Hoffmann, 1988; Nissen, \n2010). Naturopathy is wider than herbalism as it includes treatment with herbal and \nhomeopathic substances, but also employs acupuncture, massage, chiropractic and any other \nCAM modalities considered relevant for a particular individual (College of Naturopathic \nMedicine, undated ). Ingested substances are also a key part of homeopathy, a system based on \nthe premise of  \u2018like cures like\u2019 or, what a substance can cause in large amounts, it can also cure, \nwhen taken in small amounts (Owen, 2007; Waisse & Bonamin, 2016).   Homeopathy, however, \nis different from herbalism and naturopathy; the substances prescribed are diluted so that they \nare present in infinitesimal amounts, and the precise remedy that has been chosen is not always \nrevealed to the patient, particularly before they have tried it (Eyles et al., 2012; Frank, 2002).  \nThe other major feature of herbalism, naturopathy and homeopathy is the importance of the \nwell-developed relationship between the practitioner and the patient or client who seeks their \nhelp.  Supplement users, in contrast, tend to have only short interactions in a retail outlet, or, for \nthose who order online, no interaction at all.  Herbalists, naturopaths and homeopaths all place \nan emphasis on carrying out an in-depth investigation of each individual\u2019s history, taking plenty \nof time (sometimes several hours), and the intuition combined with reasoned deduction that the \npractitioner brings to bear on the person\u2019s concerns (Brien et al., 2011; Bussing et al., 2010; \nEyles et al., 2012; Eyles et al., 2011; Legenne et al., 2015; Little, 2009; Oberg et al., 2014; \n15 \n \n \nViksveen & Relton, 2017; Wardle et al., 2010).  The dominant themes in these studies are around \nthe empathy and skill shown by practitioners, providing the ability for people to tell their stories, \nand the resulting optimism and feelings of coping that they engender.  Patients and clients \nreport that they appreciate these skills, feel listened to and like the collaborative approach \nwhere the practitioner treats them in a way that is \u201cunderstandable in a personalised rather \nthan theoretical way\u201d (Little, 2009: 304).  These studies are aligned with broader investigations \nacross the spectrum of CAM therapies where the primary focus is on the benefits of the patient-\npractitioner experience and its implied (or explicitly stated) contrast with orthodox care (Wardle \net al., 2010).  Participants commented in such studies that they wanted a more holistic approach \nto health than the orthodox system offered; they desired a system of care that took into account \nthe importance of the mind-body interaction for healing and wellness, and offered a spiritual \ncomponent (Chang & Wang, 2009; Haddon, 2001; Little, 2009).   Additionally, CAM treatments \nwere said to allow individuals to have more autonomy over their personal health care and \nexperience a more collaborative and empowering form of care than they received with \nconventional care (Haddon, 2001; Hedderson et al., 2004; Stoneman et al., 2013).  However, \nalthough it was common for participants in many of these studies to report that they sought out \nalternative treatments because of negative experiences with orthodox health care (Furnham et \nal., 1995; Klein et al., 2005; O'Callaghan & Jordan, 2003), most people continued to use the two \nsystems in parallel, seeing them as complementary rather than mutually exclusive (Legenne et \nal., 2015; Nichol et al., 2013; Viksveen & Relton, 2017).   \nResearch gaps   \nIn spite of the number of studies covered above, they provide only a limited understanding \nabout the reasons that underlie the widespread and growing use of supplements. It is one thing \nto hear from users that they consider these products more natural, that they want to improve \nand maintain their health or that they are disillusioned with experiences from their usual health \ncare provider so they turn elsewhere.  However, these statements simply raise more complex \nquestions that beg for further investigation.  What did people mean by \u2018natural\u2019 for example?  \nWhat experiences had led them to distrust usual medical care?  Why did they believe that \ntreating themselves in this way would keep them healthy?  What was behind their satisfaction \nwith these independent health practices?  Moreover, many of the studies available are now \nmore than a decade old.  It appeared that after a flurry of studies published between 2000 and \n2010, interest had waned.  Was this an indication that there was little more to investigate?  Was \nthe continually increasing popularity of these products simply a result of clever marketing to \n16 \n \n \nthose who continued to ignore expert advice?  And if these products were as ineffective and/or \nrisky as claimed, how, in such a risk- averse age (Lupton, 1999) could more and more of them \ncontinue to be so widely sold to the public without the regulation that medical professionals \nwere calling for?  It seemed important to hear more from supplement users themselves about \ntheir supplement use; why they had started taking them and what their experiences had been.   \nAs a broad framing of the study overall, I wanted to look briefly at the role of ingested \nsubstances on a wider historical scale.  The literature around supplement use appeared to \nassume that it was a modern phenomenon, yet the taking of substances which become \nembodied and lead to feelings of healing and enablement has been a focus of traditional \nmedicine from the earliest times.  Moreover, references to the power of substances are \nthreaded through myths and legends as well as literature both ancient and modern. It seemed to \nme that there was a long tradition of ingesting substances that was linked to human efforts to \nenhance wellbeing and overcome obstacles that must be playing some part in self-care practices \nwith supplements, yet I had not seen any reference to this in the literature I had read.   \nWithin this wider framework, several other key areas stood out as in need of investigation.  The \nfirst of these was the taken-for-granted assumption in reported studies that \u2018natural\u2019 products \nwere intrinsically safe and a means of offsetting risks to health.  These concepts had been \nfrequently raised by participants in previous investigations but appeared to be under-theorised; \nthey had largely been treated at face value and the discourses about them assumed to be clear-\ncut and unproblematic, having a single uncontested meaning that everyone understood and \nshared (Durante et al., 2001; Eliason et al., 1999; Joos et al., 2012; Little, 2009; Peters et al., \n2003; Rozin et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2006; Thompson & Nichter, 2007; Vickers et al., 2006). \nFrom previous work I had carried out in the context of environmental risk (Bidwell & Thompson, \n2012; Bidwell, 2011) I was aware that both naturalness and risk are complex constructs with \nindividual, social, cultural and moral dimensions (Duncan & Duncan, 2004; Lupton, 2013; Pawson \n& Brooking, 2013; Petersen & Lupton, 1996; Zinn, 2008).  It seemed important to pay much \ncloser attention to what was going on behind these surface statements that were so often \nrepeated about the attractive qualities of supplements.    \nSecondly, the physical presence of the supplement products in pharmacies, health stores and in \nthe homes of people I interviewed appeared to have been almost entirely overlooked.  It was \nthe sheer volume of these \u2018natural health\u2019 products that had first drawn my attention to the \ntopic, and yet I had found nothing in the literature that had examined what role their materiality \nmight play.  There were however, some leads in studies that had examined how medicinal \n17 \n \n \nsubstances (of all kinds, not just supplements) acted in the home setting.  A study by Hodgetts et \nal (2011), for example, framed medicines as \u2018objects from outside\u2019 that became woven in to \nrelationships and meanings within domestic settings.  During the course of my research, two \nfurther papers explored the home as a centre of medication practices in a way that was different \nfrom but aligned to my thinking (Dew et al., 2014; Dew et al., 2015).  Recently too, a Swedish \nstudy (Reichenpfader et al., 2019) looked at the human and non-human actors that are brought \ntogether in medication practices when people are discharged from hospital to home with newly \nprescribed medications.  While none of these papers focused specifically on supplements, and \nnone on retail settings, the theoretical approaches and the consideration of the medicines \nthemselves as \u2018actors\u2019 in the home setting were relevant to gaps I had identified and wanted to \ninvestigate.   \nThirdly, while some investigations had looked at empowerment and personal control over health \n(Haddon, 2001; Hedderson et al., 2004; Sointu, 2013; Stoneman et al., 2013), they had largely \nbeen limited to wider studies of CAM treatments, with supplements only one minor component \navailable to people who seek alternative therapies. They included Sointu\u2019s (2013) study on \nembodied subjectivity, expertise and experiences of healing in people who sought out CAM \ntreatments, and the studies by Danish researchers (Baarts & Pedersen, 2009; Pedersen, 2013, \n2018; Pedersen & Baarts, 2018) on CAM therapies as an expression of technologies of the self \n(Foucault, 1988) which people engaged in as a low risk health regimen. Also relevant were \naspects of the study by Reichenpfader et al., (2019) which had noted the way people make the \nchange from being passive recipients of medicines in hospital to taking control of their regime \nonce at home.  None of these studies, however, had looked at supplements alone, which, given \nthat they are more directly under an individual\u2019s personal control than therapist-dependent \ntreatments or prescribed medicines, would seem to warrant a separate and more detailed \ninvestigation.  \nThese gaps in the research were the starting points for the investigation.  Although this seems \nclear with hindsight, when I look back to the start of my study, the direction of the argument \nwas still somewhat uncertain at the beginning, and it was a process that developed gradually \nover time.  The journey from my initial inspiration for the topic to the submission of the \ncompleted thesis was a lengthy and continual evolution that began with the core ideas for \ninvestigation that I have set out above and incorporated others as they proved to be relevant.  \nHow my study was finally structured is set out below.      \n18 \n \n \nStructure of the thesis \nChapter 2 is a background chapter giving a brief overview of the place that ingested substances \nhave occupied firstly in myths and legends of the life quest and some well-known examples from \nliterature and popular culture that echo this tradition.  This is followed by a historical overview \nof traditional and folk medicines, the gradual separation of orthodox medicine from lay health \npractices, and the persistence of home remedies in Western societies.   \nChapter 3 sets out the methodology and methods for the study.  It describes my epistemological \nstance, and discusses my own position in relation to the topic and the generation of the data.  It \ncovers the selection and interviewing of the participants, their characteristics, and the analytical \napproach.  It concludes with a short overview of the major theoretical framing of the study.   \nChapter 4 investigates the main discourses about supplements that the participants raised, using \nideas drawn from Derrida\u2019s writing on deconstruction.  It examines in detail three main concepts \nthat were highlighted as reasons for supplement use: their naturalness, holistic characteristics, \nand their role in counteracting risks to health.  The chapter shows how diverse and fluid these \nconcepts are, continually developing and changing over time.  \nChapter 5 turns attention directly to the physical presence of the supplements themselves which \nplayed a key role in the interviews. Materialist concepts are used to examine the agency of these \nnon-human things to create effects in people\u2019s lives and to inter-connect with the discourses \nexamined in the previous chapter. \nChapter 6 focuses on negotiations of power in relation to the way participants managed their \nhealth with supplements.  Drawing from Foucault\u2019s writing on governmentality and the \nformation of subjects in the neoliberal state, it examines the participants\u2019 attitude to personal \nresponsibility and expertise as a way of building a sense of control over health options.  In time \nthe confidence they acquired became part of their sense of identity as someone who knew \nabout supplements and could pass on what they had learned to others.       \nChapter 7, the discussion and conclusion, first draws the analysis chapters together using ideas \nfrom Barad to show how discourse, materiality and power come together and are enacted in the \nsupplement practices that take place in everyday life.  It looks at the human quest for a \nmeaningful life, and the role that the ritual element of supplement practices play in deferring \nfears of disability and decay. Finally the conclusion links back to the ancient theme of the quest \nand the need for enablers that support the life journey.   \n19 \n \n \n  \n20 \n \n \nChapter 2: Ingested substances: ancient and modern \nLegends and literature \nThroughout human history, people have sought out substances to protect them against the \nharms that threaten to disrupt their life journey. The motif of the powerful substance that \nenables, protects and cures is woven into both myths and legends and what is known about the \nhistory of traditional medicines from before the start of recorded history (Anderson, 2005). \nIndeed magic and medicine are hard to separate one from the other because both offered a \nmeans of protecting and preserving life, and the natural and supernatural powers they appealed \nto were intimately linked (Smith, 1953: 847).  This chapter provides a brief overview of ancient \nand modern healing and protective substances as a background to the use of supplements \ntoday.    \nThe tale of the person who sets out on a perilous journey, the hardships and barriers they face \nand their ultimate salvation is a universal generic narrative (ur-narrative) that is found in almost \nall cultures (Berger, 2016).  Campbell (1973) in his study of cross cultural mythology traces the \ncommon characteristics in the many different narratives of the archetypical hero or heroine who \nis called to set out from home on a quest during which he or she will need to battle against both \ninternal and external forces  to achieve their reward.  The universal life journey (termed the \n\u2018monomyth\u2019 by Campbell), can be found in myths, legends, and religions throughout the ages \nand continues in popular culture in the present day.   The life journey is, however, fraught with \nobstacles and grave dangers that stand in the way of the central character reaching their goal.  \nThese perils are symbolised in various ways, but it is in the process of the journey and \novercoming its difficulties that the hero or heroine achieves self-realisation and personal growth, \nbecomes a force for good, and, in some myths, returns to become a leader of their people.  The \ncharacters in these ancient stories have exceptional qualities that make them stand out from \nothers, but their journey also provides a template for the ordinary person who is faced with \nobstacles that threaten to disrupt their lives and which they need to overcome (Hubbell, 1990). \nWhether exceptional or ordinary, however, the ultimate success is by no means certain, and \nsome will suffer or even die in the attempt.  It is the quest and the ongoing journey that is \nimportant, not whether or not the destination is reached.    \nA recurrent motif in many of these narratives is the supernatural object or substance which \ncomes in to the story at a critical time to protect the hero or heroine from harm, cure their \ninjuries, and revive them so that they can continue pursuing their quest (Campbell, 1973: 57).  \n21 \n \n \nMyths, fairy tales and legends across many cultures are rich in these powerful supernatural \n\u2018things\u2019 such as a ring, a cloak, a sword that enable impossible obstacles to be overcome and the \njourney to progress. Alternatively the \u2018thing\u2019 may be a substance with mysterious properties to \nbe consumed in the form or food or drink or rubbed onto the body to be absorbed through the \nskin.   The substance is subtly different from the artefacts like the swords, cloaks, and rings; \nthese latter are already imbued with power which the hero can use but they do not become part \nof him or her.  In swallowing or absorbing the substance, however, the power is embodied in the \nhero or heroine, enabling them to become braver, plan more strategically and be more able to \nwithstand and overcome the perils of the ongoing journey.  In the ancient Greek legend of Jason \nand the Argonauts, for example, Medea gives Jason a potion she has concocted from the blood \nred juice of the crocus  (Graves, 1977).  Once he has swallowed1 it, Jason is protected from the \nbull with the fiery breath and enabled to fight off the armed men and that spring from the \ndragon\u2019s teeth that block his way to claiming the golden fleece.  Similarly, in the Odyssey, the \nsorceress Circe has given Odysseus a magic herb which protects him from her enchantment.  \nThus enabled, he forces Circe to turn his men back to human form so they can continue with \ntheir  journey (Rouse, 1957:175).  Potions are also found in many fairy tales; in the Grimm\u2019s fairy \ntale of the Twelve Dancing Princesses, a draught of drugged wine administered to their worldly \nsuitors allows the princesses to escape them and pursue their evening adventures dancing in the \nenchanted forest (Sideman & Kredel, 1977).  Probably the best known of all in the Western \nworld is Hans Christian Anderson\u2019s tale of the Little Mermaid. In this story, the mermaid wants \nabove all to win the heart of the prince with whom she has fallen in love but knows she can \nnever be with him unless she can become human.  Begging the sea witch to help her, she obtains \na magic potion.  When she reaches the shore and drinks it, it enables her to grow legs and take \non a human form of great beauty and gracefulness, so that she achieves her desire and marries \nthe prince (Andersen, 1996 [1930]). The little mermaid must, however, pay a high price for her \nhuman form, losing her voice and living a life of pain as every step on her human legs is like \nwalking on knives.  So the magic potions are not always benign.  The witches in Shakespeare\u2019s \nMacbeth, for example, are brewing \u201cpoisoned entrails\u201d in their cauldron with obvious malign \nintent, and the apple that Snow White chokes on was intended to kill her and put an end to her \nbeauty overshadowing the wicked stepmother.  Whether positive or negative, however, these \nsupernatural substances have agency, they cause effects, and carry the action of the narrative \nforward. A fascinating aspect of these examples, (though outside the scope of the study to \n                                                          \n1 In some versions Jason anoints himself with a liquid rather than swallowing it.  \n22 \n \n \nexplore) is that in almost all cases the substance is supplied by a female protagonist, counter to \nthe usual gendered stereotypes of women as beautiful but passive in these traditional tales \n(Evans 1998; West 1993; Haase 2004; Rowe 1979).   \nClosely related to the powerful and protective substance of legend, is the substance that revives \nand resuscitates after injury or even death so that the hero is enabled to return to full strength \nand continue with their quest. Strengthening and restorative herbs feature in the Fellowship of \nthe Ring when Frodo is lying wounded:  \n\u2026Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped.  The pungent \nfragrance filled the dell \u2026 soon Frodo felt the pain leave him, and his breath grew easy \n(Tolkien, 1974: 319).   \nThe same idea is found in the Grimm\u2019s fairy tale of the Two Brothers where a hare places a \nmagic herb in the dead man\u2019s mouth to revive him (Varecha, 1982), and in the Celtic tales of the \nHorned Women and the Battle of the Birds, where dead and bewitched children are brought \nback to life by sprinkling them with water mixed with blood (Jacobs, 1994). The elixir of life motif \n(or the elixir of immortality) also occurs across many cultures including Chinese and Indian \nmyths, and throughout Polynesia.  Variations on the myth of the Land of the Water of Life of the \nGods can be found in many of the Pacific Island groups including New Zealand, Tonga, Samoa, \nTahiti as well as the Hawaiian islands (Beckwith, 1970). The land lies beyond the horizon where \nthere is a lake of living water and where the gods have immortality.  This water is called Ka wai \nola a Ka-ne or the water of life of Ka-ne and has the power to restore humans to life.  One story \nconcerns a king who was gravely ill.  His three sons each went searching after the water of life, \ntwo of whom met with disastrous fates, until eventually it was found by one son and brought to \nthe king who immediately regained his health and strength (Westervelt, 1993). It is this same \nwater of life that features in the M\u0101ori legend of the moon:   \n when the moon sickens, wanes and comes nigh to death, she goes afar off across the \nocean to seek the waters of life, or fountain of youth, the Waiora a T\u0101ne.  In a far region \nshe bathes her wasted form in the healing waters of T\u0101ne and so returns to this world as \nHina-keha, once more young and beautiful (Best, 1951:137-138).   \nIngested substances with supernatural properties are also recurring motifs in Jewish and \nChristian traditions.  In the Biblical story of the flight of the Israelites from Egypt, manna comes \n23 \n \n \ndown from heaven (Exodus Chapter 16)2 and later on in the journey when the Israelites were \ndying in the desert in their flight from Egypt, Moses struck the rock and \u201cwater gushed in \nabundance\u201d (Numbers 20:11) thus allowing them to continue their journey to the promised \nland.  Jesus, too spoke about living bread and living water.  In the incident where he meets the \nSamaritan woman at the well (John 4:13) Jesus tells her, \u201cwhoever drinks the water I give them \nwill never thirst.  Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up \nto eternal life.\u201d A little further on Jesus refers to himself as being \u201cthe living bread that came \ndown from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.\u201d  These instances lead up to \nthe symbolic gift of the Last Supper where Jesus designates the bread and wine as giving \neverlasting life to those who \u201cdo this as a memorial of me\u201d (Luke 22: 19).   \nThese ancient motifs appear in modern guises in both literary and popular works.   The \nmonomyth of the hero who overcomes the dangers and trials that hinder their quest is the \nprincipal theme of the Harry Potter series and Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, among many others \n(Robbins, 2005).  George Lucas has acknowledged that the Star Wars series was heavily \ninfluenced by the \u201cHero with a Thousand Faces\u201d (Tiffin, 1999), Joseph Campbell\u2019s scholarly work \non the many versions of the monomyth of the hero\u2019s journey (1973). The mysterious and \npowerful substance motif is repeated in Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice in Wonderland.  After falling down \nthe rabbit hole and then drinking the potion in the bottle she finds on the table at the bottom, \nAlice shrinks to a height of ten inches.  Now she is small enough to get access to the new world \nshe has found, and \u201cher face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for \ngoing through the little door into the lovely garden\u201d (Carroll, 1865 [1898]: 10).  Thus enabled she \ncan embark on her journey to independence and self-discovery.  In humorous form, the same \nmotif is found in the Asterix series where the venerable Druid Getafix brews magic potions that \nendow the person who drinks them with superhuman strength (Goscinny & Uderzo, 1974).  \nSimilarly, Mad Max in the Princess Bride revives the dead hero Wesley with the aid of a \nchocolate covered capsule so he can rescue the princess and defeat the forces of evil (Goldman, \n2003).  In short, the notion of the ingested magical substance that protects, enables, cures, and \nrevives is a motif that runs through many of the \u201csymbolic stories that embody the enduring and \nuniversal qualities of our experiences\u201d(Smith, 2002: 2).  As Armstrong (2005: 4) has observed, \n\u201cmythology speaks of another plane that exists alongside our own world and that in some sense \nsupports it.\u201d    \n                                                          \n2 All Biblical references are from The Jerusalem Bible 1968. Jones, A. (ed).  London: Longman.  \n24 \n \n \nRunning in parallel with this other-worldly plane, are the substances that have been used from \nthe earliest times for healing in traditional medicine. The art of medicine implicitly acknowledges \nits debt to Asclepios (Asclepius in Latin), the god of healing in the Greek myths, whose staff with \nthe coiled snake, chosen because the sloughing of the snake skin was believed to renew youth, is \nstill associated with medicine.  The connection between magic and healing is not always clear \ncut; there is a blurred boundary where they cross over or at least complement each other.  As \nPorter (1997: 33) has commented, \u201cbecause illness raises the spectre of that mystery of \nmysteries, death\u201d, medicine, religion, and magic have always been closely intertwined.  Healing \ntakes place through magic substances in myth and legends and traditional healers have often \nbeen credited with magic powers, particularly in situations where illness may be attributed to \nsupernatural causes (Adewuya & Makanjuola, 2008; Bartocci & Littlewood, 2004; Petrus & \nBogopa, 2007; Razali et al., 1996). Many traditional healers have been credited with \nsupernatural powers to do good, or if their healing arts did not work as expected, have been \ndemonised and suspected of being witches (Horsley, 1979; Mead, 1965; Minkowski, 1992).  The \nvast history of traditional medicinal substances across the many cultures of the world is far more \nthan can be covered here.   The next section, however, highlights some aspects of relevance to \nthe topic of the thesis.  \nTraditional medicines \nArcheological records show that since prehistoric times, people have always sought traditional \nmedicines from healers to ease their pain and cure their ailments (Anderson, 2005; Smith, 1953). \nEvidence is available, for example, that shows plant substances were used in prehistoric times to \ntreat intestinal worm infestations (Chaves & Reinhard, 2006) or to reduce the pain of dental \nextractions (Facco & Zanette, 2017). Indian Aryurvedic medicine and Chinese healing systems \nusing herbs and acupuncture are highly developed systems that reach back into history and have \ncontinued into the present day (Kumar & Navaratnam, 2013; Yang et al., 2011). Although less \nknown in developed countries, healing traditions from indigenous peoples in all continents also \ndate back over centuries and are still practised, including those from Canadian First Nations \n(Cook, 2005; Wilson, 2003; Wilson & Rosenberg, 2002), New Zealand M\u0101ori (known as rongo\u0101) \n(Ahuriri-Driscoll et al., 2008; Durie, 1993) South American peoples (Neuwinger, 2000; \nVanderbroek et al., 2004) and the many traditions from Africa (Mahomoodally, 2013), each of \nwhich is a topic in its own right.   \n25 \n \n \nThe origin of making medicinal substances that eventually developed into the practice of \nmedicine as it is known today in Western countries was influenced, according to Court (2005), by \nfive civilisations: Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Rome and Arabia.  However, it was with the \nGreeks that particular individuals first became identified with medicine, starting with \nHippocrates (460-377 BC), and followed by the two Romans, Dioscorides (50-100 AD) and Galen \n(129-199AD), and then the Arabic scholar Ibn Sina (980-1037AD), known as the Hippocrates of \nthe Arab world (Court, 2005: 35). It appears however, that folk medicine continued as it always \nhad independently from the writings of these learned men of the time.  For ordinary people \ntraditional remedies were passed down from one generation to another or learnt by observation \nand experience.  The folk healing practices of the time are not well documented and what is \nknown about them has been constructed from the arts of the period: engravings, sculpture, song \nand story (Minkowski, 1992). In this period before the founding of university medical schools, \nhealing was pragmatic and non-academic, practised by those of both high and low birth, using \ntherapies based on botanicals, traditional home remedies, bloodletting and native intelligence, \nsometimes accompanied by amulets, incantations and magic (Demaitre, 2013). The \u2018healer\u2019 was \na fluid concept and could extend to anyone who treated the sick; medical care outside the family \ncircle was available from herbalists and \u2018wise women\u2019, as well as specialist infirmarians in \nconvents and monasteries (Minkowski, 1992). The hospitals offered care rather than cure, and \nwhat welfare they provided was linked to the health of the soul as well as the body, offering \ntheir services as a religious expression that combined the prayers of the sick and their living \nbenefactors to help the souls of the departed through purgatory to heaven (Horden, 1988).      \nThere were in existence, however, a number of medical manuals for educated people who could \nread Latin, with literacy being a distinguishing mark of the elite healer.  Demaitre (2013), lists 24 \nmanuals of practica medicinae  (the practice of medicine) evenly spread across the period from \n1000 to 1500.   Several of the earliest of these were translations of Arabic texts, particularly the \ntranslation into Latin by Gerard of Cremona (1114-1187) of a large volume compiled by Avicenna \nthat incorporated Greek and Roman as well as Persian, Arabic and far Eastern teaching \n(Demaitre, 2013: 10).  This volume became known as the Canon of Medicine.  In Chaucer\u2019s \nCanterbury Tales, the description of the Doctor of Physic shows his status by itemising all the \nlearned men of medicine with whom he (and clearly Chaucer himself) was familiar:     \n  Well knew he the old Esculapius,  \nAnd Deiscorides and eek Rufus, \n26 \n \n \nOld Ypocras, Hali and Galien, \nSerapion, Razis, and Avicen, \nAverrois, Damascien, and Constantin, \nBernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertin. (Demaitre, 2013: 4) \nThese fifteen authorities span one and a half millennia from classical Greece through the peak of \nIslamic culture, right through to Chaucer\u2019s own time. Illustrations from the illuminated \nmanuscripts of the time show that many of the medical practitioners were monks, identified by \nthe way they were depicted with their tonsure and robes.  Manuscripts were rare and prized \nitems, copied by hand on to parchment or vellum, and they became closely associated with \nadvanced medical learning, leading to a situation where pieces of parchment became a proxy for \nmedicine and gullible people could be exploited by being sold them as \u2018healing\u2019 amulets \n(Demaitre, 2013: 5-6).    \nThe foundation of hospitals in Europe can be documented from around the beginning of the 13th \ncentury and at the same time the teaching of medicine in universities became increasingly \nstructured, drawing from the classical sources and the texts mentioned by Chaucer.  Ideas about \nhealth and illness of the time were based on the four humours that were said to make up the \nhuman body: blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile.  These components were associated, \nrespectively, with sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric and melancholic characteristics.  The individual \ncombination of each of these components was believed to shape each person\u2019s emotional make \nup and determine the working of their bodily organs (Demaitre, 2013: 17).  The details of how \nthe medieval practitioners thought about the body and its workings are complex and the \nconcepts that underpinned their approach to healing are completely different from the modern \nunderstanding of anatomy and physiology that are the foundation of modern biomedicine. \nHowever, two factors that resonate with contemporary critiques of the biomedical model of \nmedicine are important:  firstly, that each person was considered to be unique and the \ntreatment was individually designed for them alone, and secondly, that treatment had a \nconservative approach, starting with lifestyle changes, or advising the use or avoidance of \ncertain foods and drinks rather than employing drugs.  Wallis (2006: 18) cites the casebook of a \nphysician from the 16th century showing that in only 12 percent of cases did patients receive a \npotion or pill.  According to Cook (1994: 1), people who consulted the physicians of the time \nwere more likely to receive \u201cgood advise [sic] and little medicine.\u201d   \n27 \n \n \nIn the late medieval and early modern period before industrialisation in Britain, the sick person \nhad a range of options to choose from in seeking treatment.  Curth (2006: 4) describes this \nperiod as the era of \u201ckitchen physik\u201d.  Anybody could buy drugs, including poisons, from \ndruggists or apothecaries and make up their own medicines as the craft guilds of spicers and \ngrocers carried out an organised trade in the supply of drugs in the major cities of England \n(Holloway, 1995). The translation into English in the early modern period of the Latin \nPharmacoepoeia by Nicholas Culpeper was also instrumental in giving access to information \nabout curative plants and remedies.  Doctors were not particularly esteemed socially, and were \nconsidered as inferiors to their better-off clients. They anyway had limited means at their \ndisposal for curing illness, and if people wanted someone outside their family, they might, \ninstead of consulting a doctor, just as well ask a \u2018wise woman\u2019 or take advice from their squire or \nlocal members of the clergy (Porter, 1993).  \nAs well as trading in drugs, apothecaries also prescribed, compounded and administered \nmedicines and were the mainstay of the general public of London and more likely than the \nphysicians to assist the less well-off (Cook, 1990; Curth, 2006; Holloway, 1995; Porter, 1993). At \nsome point most people would pay for medical advice from a practitioner, but self-care or \nadvice and care from family or friends was usually the first line of treatment.  Common herbs \nand ingredients were freely available in the wild or in gardens and these could be supplemented \nwith drugs and compounds from apothecaries. Throughout the early modern period and \u201cwell \ninto the nineteenth century all drugs \u2013 even dangerous ones like opium- and poisons could be \nfreely bought over the counter\u201d (Porter, 1993: 24). There was nothing to prevent a lay person \nusing the entire range of medicines as they wished and no one thought that they would offend a \ndoctor by trying to treat themselves first.  In this period, it was \u201cvirtually impossible to draw a \nline between \u2018lay\u2019 or \u2018folk\u2019 herbal remedies and those of learned medicine\u201d (Wallis, 2006: 15). \nThe separation of healing professions into formal experts credentialed through registration in \ncolleges or associations and endorsed by the state in contrast to those \u2018alternative\u2019 therapies \nthat did not have official authorisation took place only gradually.  It had its beginnings in the 16th \ncentury when various guilds of druggists, apothecaries and physicians combined into societies so \nas to have a greater power of numbers over the prescribing and selling of medicines.  The Royal \nCollege of Physicians was founded in 1518 and the Society of Apothecaries in 1617.  Both had \ngovernmental authorisation to practice pharmacy and medicine and they jockeyed for control of \n\u2018physic\u2019 during the 17th Century (Holloway, 1988: 79).  Court cases brought by the College of \nPhysicians with the aim of undermining the status of apothecaries during this period were not \n28 \n \n \nsuccessful. The legal points turned on what exactly \u2018physic\u2019 was, and even if physicians practised \nit, whether they had the right to stop others from doing it too (Cook, 1990; Curth, 2006; \nHolloway, 1995; Porter, 1993). \nThe transition from a guild-based economy to a free market in Britain during the 17th and 18th \ncenturies had a far-reaching effect on the supply of medicines (Holloway, 1995).  The \ncommercial possibilities available in the open market saw the emergence of an increasing \nnumber of chemists and druggists who advertised and sold their own brand of medicines which \nthey publicised in the popular press along with testimonials from satisfied customers (Curth, \n2006).  Although the College of Physicians made attempts to limit this activity, it appears that \ntheir members too, actively developed and marketed their own patented products.  Bivins \n(2007: 6) describes this era as a \u201cflowering of medical commercialism and ingenuity and \nluxuriant growth in the medical marketplace\u201d. Those marketing or providing the different cures \nand therapies did not propose different medical systems or models of the body or even a \ndifferent understanding of disease processes but just that their remedies were more effective \nthan those of anyone else (Bivins, 2007).    A wide range of what would now be considered \n\u2018alternative therapies\u2019 flourished including homeopathy, mesmerism, and Coffinism3 (medical \nbotany).  There were also therapies from Chinese systems such as acupuncture, moxibustion \n(the burning of dried mugwort on acupuncture points of the body), and Ayurvedic medicines \nfrom India which had come to Europe from the spread of European trade and colonisation of \nthose countries (Bivins, 2007).    \nThe beginnings of professional and \u2018alternative\u2019 health care  \nThe professionalisation of medicine and pharmacy that saw them gradually develop into the way \nthey are in New Zealand today dates from the 19th century in Britain.  Worling (2005) describes \nthe period between 1617 and 1841 as a time of constant disputes between physicians and \napothecaries and between apothecaries and chemists and druggists.  It was a period when \nmedical practitioners increased their efforts to contain the power of the chemists and druggists \nby emphasising the value of their specialist training and knowledge and sought to place \nconsumers firmly under the doctor\u2019s expertise.   At the same time pharmacists gradually became \nestablished as the officially sanctioned dispensers of the medicines that doctors prescribed, with \nthe Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain being formed in 1841 and granted a Royal Charter \n                                                          \n3 Named after American herbalist Albert Isaiah Coffin whose book The Botanic Guide to Health (1845) was \na guide for lay people to treat themselves using the properties of plants.   \n29 \n \n \ntwo years later (Worling, 2005).  During the 1850s, several pieces of legislation were enacted4 \nwhich restricted the title pharmacist, chemist or druggist to registered persons, gave the \nPharmaceutical Society the right to examine and register those who were licensed and therefore \nlegally able to operate under these titles (Hunt, 2005: 79).  However, it was not until the early \nyears of the 20th century that registered pharmacists secured the exclusive right to dispense \nprescriptions for those people who were insured under the National Insurance Act of 1911.  By \n1946 when the National Health Service Act extended health coverage to the entire population, it \nbecame normal for medical prescriptions to be dispensed only by qualified pharmacists (Hunt, \n2005: 92).  The changes that began in Britain in the mid-nineteenth century were paralleled in \nNew Zealand though at slightly later dates (Combes, 1981), so that by the middle of the 20th \ncentury registered medical professionals controlled all the prescribing of medicines, and \nregistered pharmacists controlled their dispensing.5 The regulation and professionalisation of \nmedicine and pharmacy created a context where forms of health care that operated under the \nmandate of government authorisation through registered professions could therefore be \ncontrasted with informal \u2018alternative\u2019 practices which were not.   \nInformal home remedies in colonial New Zealand  \nWhile this formalisation of the respective roles of medicine and pharmacy was taking place, \nordinary people continued to use home remedies and informal treatments as they had always \ndone. During the 19th century, the period of European colonisation of New Zealand, treating \nmost injuries and illnesses independently of medical advice whenever possible was a feature of \nalmost all households.  It was essential outside the main centres as travel was difficult and \ndoctors often many hours journey away (Coleborne & Godtschalk, 2013). Moreover, even in \nbigger towns, doctors and medicines were expensive unless people were well resourced, so that \nhome remedies were a necessity rather than a choice. Substances (including poisons) could be \npurchased directly from pharmacies without a doctor\u2019s prescription and pharmacists also made \nup their own products, and sold patent medicines, so that self-prescribed \u2018alternative\u2019 medicines \ncontinued in parallel with the formal system (Homan, 2005). In the colonial era, the current \ndistinction between herbal and formally prescribed medicines was less clear anyway as \npharmacists primarily worked with \u201cnatural or crude drugs, ie. roots, rhizomes, leaves, barks and \n                                                          \n4The  Arsenic Act of 1851, followed by the Pharmacy Act of 1852 and the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1868 \n(Bartrip 1992:55).   \n5 This remains largely the same today apart from the extension of some prescribing rights to nurses and \npharmacists.  \n30 \n \n \nflowers using the processes of maceration, percolation and infusion\u201d  (Combes, 1981: 41) to \nextract the active ingredients.    Contemporary letters, recipe books, and compendia of \nhousehold hints illustrate the advice that was given and the substances used to treat various \nconditions; Coleborne and Godtschalk (2013), drawing from 19th century diaries of pioneer \nfamilies, describe the need for households to help one another out at times of illness or \naccident, and the financial difficulties that resulted if a doctor needed to be called in.  Women \ngenerally bore the greatest load in tending to the sick, even when they themselves were unwell.  \nBrewis (1982), in her compilation of recipes from letters, diaries and cookbooks of the period  \nincludes a section of home remedies for treating conditions ranging from asthma to \n\u2018melancholia\u2019 and dropsy.  Brett\u2019s Colonists Guide and Cyclopedia of Useful Knowledge (Leys, \n1883) has a medical care section curiously sandwiched between a section on raising poultry and \nanother on curing and storing produce.  It includes \u2018family doctor\u2019 advice from a member of the \nRoyal College of Surgeons, followed by a section on homeopathy by one James A. Pond, \ndescribed as a homeopathic chemist. Both these sections on health have a similar alphabetical \nlist of advice on the treatment of illness, except that general preventive advice on diet, exercise, \nfresh air, and cleanliness are given at the start of the homeopathy section but absent from the \n\u2018family doctor\u2019 list.  Interestingly, there is considerable cross over between the two lists of \nremedies mentioned with sulphur, camphor, opium and laudanum among those that are \nmentioned in both.  These last two were in frequent use and easily available for anyone to buy in \nthe 19th century (Acker, 1995).  One remedy for diarrhoea and \u2018English cholera\u2019 (Brewis, 1982: \n123) calls for 40 drops of peppermint, 80 drops of laudanum and half a pint of brandy with a \nlarge tablespoon to be taken half hourly and the warning that it is for adults only.   \nM\u0101ori also had an established system of healing known as rongo\u0101 consisting of five modalities; \nkarakia (prayer and incantation), rongo\u0101 rakau (medicinal herbs), mirimiri (massage), \nwai/hauwai (water or steam and matakite (prophecy) (Ahuriri-Driscoll et al., 2008; Durie, 1993). \nThe 19th century colonists, particularly the chemists among them, took a considerable interest in \nthe properties of the plants used in M\u0101ori medicines.  A four page entry in the Colonists\u2019 Guide \ndescribed them as being a fruitful area that chemists might benefit from further researching.  \nThe author of this section was said to have  \u201crescued from oblivion nearly all that is known of the \nold Maori [sic] uses of the New Zealand medicinal plants\u201d (Leys, 1883: 480). The article treated \nrongo\u0101 purely from a pharmaceutical effectiveness standpoint, describing individual plants and \ntheir known application for particular conditions.  Plants such as kawakawa (Piper excelsum), \nm\u0101nuka (Leptospermum scoparium), and koromiko (Hebe salicifolia), for example, were among \n31 \n \n \nthose listed, the last being noted as a treatment for diarrhoea.  There was no recognition in \nthese pages of the wider spiritual context of rongo\u0101 M\u0101ori as a whole system of healing, which is \nmuch more complex than herbal medicines alone (Ahuriri-Driscoll, 2014). .   \nThe persistence of home remedies into the mid-20th century  \nThe home remedies and self-help therapies mentioned in the Colonists\u2019 Guide may sound quaint \nand outdated today, but many of them were still current until at least the early 1970s.  My own \nmemories stretch back to my early childhood in the 1950s when pharmacists stocked a wide \nrange of components for making up home remedies.  They could be purchased by members of \nthe public in small quantities or made up in the pharmacy on request (Combes, 1981). Home \nremedies in widespread use at the time included Bonnington\u2019s Irish Moss cough mixture, \ndifferent brands of indigestion tablets, California syrup of figs (a laxative), gripe water for babies, \nand the patent medicines brought round by the Rawleigh\u2019s man.6  Our local chemist made up his \n\u2018own brand\u2019 range of basic products in brown glass bottles, labelled with his credentials.  \nDiarrhoea and vomiting (sometimes known euphemistically as \u2018summer sickness\u2019) were subject \nto a range of recommendations for home remedies that were supposed to \u2018settle the stomach\u2019 \nincluding grated apple, dry toast, a Rawleigh\u2019s product known as Pleasant Relief, flat lemonade, \nand even ice cream.  Basic products and the patent medicines along with aspirin, beef tea, and \nbed rest were used as supportive care in the days before vaccinations were available for \nmeasles7, mumps, rubella and chicken pox.  All children were expected to contract them at some \nstage and my siblings and I were no exception.  Non-ingested products such as antiphlogistine \nfor boils, hydrogen peroxide and antiseptic dyes for skin abrasions, thrush and tinea, salt water \ngargles for sore throats, and camomile lotion for bites and skin rashes were also common.  From \nmy own experience, the remedies used were largely limited to treating an illness or skin \ninfection; it was not usual to take a product for prevention apart from patent medicine \u2018tonics\u2019 \nthat were available.  Vitamin C tablets appeared in our household for the first time during the \nmid-1960s as a protection from winter colds and bronchitis, and during the late 1960s large fizzy \n                                                          \n6 Rawleighs: a Australasian company that sold patent medicines and cooking essences door to door.  It still \nexists today though the method of sale and the range of products have changed, see \nhttps://www.rawleighs.com/  \n7 The first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 (Bloch et al 1985), with the others following.  \n32 \n \n \ntablets containing 1000mg doses of Vitamin C became a remedy for hangovers after student \nparties among some of the young men I knew.   \nDevelopments in medical care that offered more treatments with prescribed antibiotics, anti-\nfungals and anti-histamines beginning in the 1940s became more widely available during the \n1950s (Gaynes, 2017). In the following couple of decades, the advent of mass production of pre-\npackaged medicines saw many of the home remedies become outdated or the substances needed \nto make them no longer readily available.  Compounding by community pharmacists was less \nnecessary except in specialised cases, and is now likely to be less than one percent of prescriptions \naccording to Krochmal (2009).  Moreover, pharmacists were reluctant to stock ingredients for \nwhich there was only minor demand and which had to be discarded before their expiry date \n(Louise Kennedy pharmacist, personal communication).  \u2018Own brand\u2019 basics and ingredients for \nhome remedies were gradually replaced by commercially produced products that could be bought \noff the shelf or ordered independently in an increasingly globalised market. These were \nsometimes simply older remedies in a new guise. Garlic, for example, which has been recognised \nas having medicinal properties since ancient times (Rivlin, 2001), no longer needs to be peeled, \ncrushed and ingested in its raw state but can be bought in a pharmacy or health food store as a \nprepackaged concentrated and odourless extract known as Kyolic\u00ae (Balamash et al., 2012).  So \nwhile the \u2018natural health\u2019 products on pharmacy and health store shelves may appear to be a new \nphenomenon, they would seem, rather, to be part of a long continuum of obtaining substances to \ntreat illness or maintain health that is connected to the history of humanity from earliest times.   \nThe difference is that the physical substances formerly used in home remedies and self-care have \nbeen reimagined, repackaged and marketed in a way that resonates with the contemporary citizen \nand can be obtained over-the-counter in a convenient ready-made form.   \n  \n33 \n \n \nChapter 3: Methodology and methods  \nIntroduction \nThe key focus of my research was to gain an insight into the perspectives of people who used \nsupplements regularly. I wanted to find out why they first started to take supplements, how they \ndecided what to take, and what kind of effects they reported on their health and wellbeing. I \nwas also interested in their sources of information about supplements, how they chose where to \nbuy them and what their general relationship was with the orthodox health system.  In addition I \nwas interested in investigating whether people who used supplements were influenced by social \nattitudes and discourses that were evident in popular and academic publications and how these \nrelated to contemporary and historical ideas and expectations of health, illness and wellbeing \nthroughout the life course.  When I started out on the study, I had thought that building a \ngreater understanding of the reasons people chose to use supplements might give a greater \ninsight into the criticism that supplement use attracts in orthodox health care and perhaps go \nsome way to reconciling the disparate views between users and critics.  As the study progressed, \nhowever, I discovered that it was more important to examine supplement use as a practice in its \nown right rather than attempting to compare it to or reconcile it with other views.      \nEpistemological approach \nA fundamental consideration in qualitative research is the ontological and epistemological \nposition of the researcher; that is, their beliefs about what it is possible to find, and how to go \nabout finding it (Giacomini, 2010). The individual researcher\u2019s beliefs about the nature of reality \nshape his or her view of the world; they affect how they approach the topic, how they generate \nand analyse the data and how they view the topic within the broader social and political context \n(Giacomini, 2010; Green & Thorogood, 2009).  Realist assumptions assume that facts are stable \nand independent of values, and that researchers can and must distance themselves from the \ndata and take an objective stance (Green & Thorogood, 2009: 13). Constructionists on the other \nhand, consider that reality is shaped by human processes that influence how the material world \nis experienced and interpreted and that one person\u2019s reality will differ from another\u2019s. Extreme \nconstructionists take the view that all reality is relative and depends entirely on how it is \nconstructed by human processes (Green and Thorogood 2009).  An individual researcher may sit \nanywhere along this spectrum from positivist assumptions that reality is fixed at the one end, to \n34 \n \n \nextreme constructionist view that nothing has independent reality and everything is relative at \nthe other end.    \nThis study started from a constructionist standpoint in which I took the view that while reality \nexists, human beliefs and attitudes have a major influence on how people perceive and engage \nwith it.  Moreover that each individual will construct these influences in different ways and that \ntheir beliefs will change over time according to new experiences that they have, and new ideas \nthey come across, as well as their own stage in life (Tulloch & Lupton, 2003). People\u2019s \nconstructions of the world are developed as the result of an interaction between their own \nprivate, cognitive processes and their exposure to the publicly shared discourses and social \nnorms of the age they live in (Giacomini, 2010).  My study aimed to understand more about the \nphenomenon of supplements and their use by investigating perspectives and subjective \nexperiences of the individual participants by talking to them and so gain a more comprehensive \nand nuanced understanding from their point of view (Kelly, 2010; Liamputtong, 2013).   \nAs the study progressed, however, it became obvious that the role of the supplement products \nthemselves needed to be included as an important part of the study.  This led me to consider a \npost-humanist element in the overall approach so that these products could be given due \nconsideration.  Post-humanism or materialist thinking, encompasses a diverse range of ideas \n(Bennett, 2010, 2012; Braidotti, 2006; Coole & Frost, 2010; Law, 1999), but they are all \nconsistent in contesting the binary opposition that sees matter as simply inert and passive until \nhumans take an interest in it (MacLure, 2015: 96).  This way of thinking disturbs the privileged \nposition of human agency and the primary importance it accords to human \u201clanguage, discourse, \nculture and values\u201d (Coole & Frost, 2010: 3).  It acknowledges that material factors are \ninfluential in what happens both in individual lives and more generally within society.  Matter is \nseen as having agency of its own, and that it can be \u201c\u2026active \u2026 productive, unpredictable\u201d \n(Coole & Frost, 2010: 9).  Bringing matter back into consideration does not  mean excluding the \nhuman, but rather restoring materiality to its place and recognising that matter and discourse \ncome together \u201c\u2026in complex and shifting arrangements from which the world emerges\u201d \n(MacLure, 2015:96).  \nTo write about both the human and non-human in the context of this study, I have chosen to use \nthe term \u2018actants\u2019.  Actants is a neutral term which simply describes the many and various \nelements that come together in a phenomenon and avoids the limitations of language that \nalways categorises people and things as being essentially different in their capacities.  An actant \n35 \n \n \ncan be any entity, whether human or non-human, that \u201cmodifies a state of affairs by making a \ndifference\u201d (Latour, 2005: 71); people, material things, discourses, practices, relationships, or \nconcepts.  Using materiality thinking to examine supplements and supplement practices made it \npossible to incorporate any actants which proved to be important in the study and allowed a \ngreater range of insights than would have been possible by focusing on human discourse alone.   \nVenturing into a post-humanist approach and combining it with the study\u2019s original \nconstructionist intention created a number of tensions in bringing these potentially divergent \napproaches together.  Nevertheless there were compelling reason for including both.  Much of \nthe data entailed participants\u2019 perceptions about what was natural, holistic and safe about \nsupplement practices.  I believed that constructionist analysis was the most fitting way to do \njustice to these data, which had been generated through talking to participants, and was the \ndominant mode of investigation throughout the study.  On the other hand, I considered it \nequally important not to leave aside the unexpected demonstrations that had occurred during \nthe interviews about the role that the material products played in their lives.  This dual approach \nwas a direct result of being confident enough to stay with one of the core strengths of \nqualitative research, that is, the researcher needs to remain open to being surprised by \ndevelopments that come to light in the course of their investigation and not set them aside if \nthey do not fit with prior intentions or assumptions (Green & Thorogood, 2009).   \nA number of authors have listed criteria against which qualitative research should be measured, \nciting characteristics such as validity, reliability and transferability (Pope & Mays, 2006) or \ncredibility, authenticity, dependability and confirmability (Liamputtong, 2013).  Lists of desirable \nqualities, however, tend to raise more questions than they answer.  These terms are \u201cquite loose \nand imprecise as far as criteria go\u2026and are themselves subject to interpretation\u2026and seem \nresistant to ever being translated into relatively stable and general standards\u201d (Smith, 1990: 185-\n186).  I found that a more helpful approach was Liamputtong\u2019s general comment that \u201cvalidity \nlies more in a subjective, human estimation of what it means to have done something well, to \nhave made an effort that is worthy of trust and to have written it up convincingly\u201d (2013: 43)  \nThis was the guidance I attempted to follow in being clear about the evolving process that \nresulted in moving between a constructionist and a post-humanist approach in different parts of \nthe thesis.   \n36 \n \n \nReflexivity \nOne measure of being trustworthy as a researcher working within a constructionist frame is to \nacknowledge that they do not sit outside the data as an authority who creates categories that \ninterpret and explain the subjects of the research.  Rather they need to consider how their own \nexperience, context and broader world view may influence what is found (Green & Thorogood, \n2009: 23; Liamputtong, 2013: 29-30; Potvin et al., 2010: 447).  They need to reflect critically on \nthe preconceptions and values that they bring to the topic and subject them to the same \nanalysis that they use with the data (Green and Thorogood, 2009). Essentially the researcher \nneeds to acknowledge that a completely objective and value-free stance is not possible, and that \ntheir findings from research will inevitably be coloured by their own views and experience. \nMalterud (2001:484) defines this as \u201cthe knower\u2019s mirror: an attitude of attending to the context \nof knowledge construction, especially to the effect of the researcher, at every step of the \nresearch process.\u201d  That means researchers need to examine how their own assumptions and \nbackground have influenced their choice of topic, their research methods, and the analyses, \ninterpretations, and writing methods that contribute to the final result (Bourke, 2014; Moser, \n2008; Wiederhold, 2015). Rather than this being a disadvantage, explicit acknowledgement of \npersonal and intellectual preconceptions enhances rather than detracts from the credibility of \nthe research findings as the different ways that each researcher approaches the same subject \nhelp to generate a more complex understanding of the phenomenon in question (Malterud, \n2001).  In the following paragraphs, I set out my reflections on my own prior experience and \nassumptions I brought into the research.   \nAs a mature student with a wide range of life experience over more than six decades, I believed \nthat I came to the topic with the advantage of having witnessed many changes in social thinking \nthat had come about over this time.  I had lived through major changes in technology and \ncommunications, advances in treatment and prevention of health and disease, the globalisation \nof trade and dissemination of goods, and an increasing diversity of the New Zealand population \nthrough immigration.  Another important difference from my early years had been the change \nover the last 60 years from beliefs that nature was there to be used by humans for their \npurposes and benefit, to the belief that the natural environment must be protected from \nexploitation and sustained for generations to come.   These changes had brought new ideas, \ndiscourses, and practices that were widely different from the homogeneous society of my \nchildhood in the 1950s and I believed they had all played some part in contemporary notions of \nhealth and illness and had an influence on the use of supplements.   \n37 \n \n \nOn a personal front, I was also well aware that I had led a secure and relatively privileged life \ncompared to many others. I had the advantage of a stable upbringing and had enjoyed access to \na wide variety of educational and occupational experiences across a variety of fields.  I had \nstudied and worked in the humanities, then in health sciences information, and over the last \nseveral decades in public health and primary health care research. I was conscious of the fact \nthat this experience would have inevitably influenced how I thought about supplements and \ntheir users, and that I would need to guard against a potential tendency on my part to privilege \nthe accounts of people who were more like me, and perhaps to place less credibility on those \nreporting attitudes and behaviour in relation to supplement use that was beyond what I would \nbe comfortable with.  Yet I was also aware that participants whose views were framed by a \ndifferent world view from mine (that is, without the same longstanding exposure to the \nacademic and health world), would be the most likely to contribute new and unknown \ninformation that would enrich my study.    \nAlthough I used supplements myself from time to time, particularly to ward off respiratory \ninfections, it was not something I had given much thought to or felt strongly about before the \npiece of previous research which had aroused my interest. I also believed I had a relatively \nneutral position towards the orthodox health system, seeing its practitioners as necessary and \nvaluable, particularly in acute care.  At the outset of my study, I believed I had no fixed opinion \neither for or against supplement use and believed I had a good grasp of the main issues.   Just \nhow superficial this turned out to be became apparent as I progressed through the study and \nheard the diverse views of the participants.  It was oddly reassuring, however, as it confirmed \nthat the topic I had chosen was worthwhile investigating in depth.   The contact with the \nparticipants, the settings in which we met, the data itself and the reading and theory I examined \nopened up a whole new range of ideas about supplements and insights about their place in \npeople\u2019s lives and at a more complex level than I had considered previously. Jackson and Mazzei  \n(2012:6) have remarked on the way a researcher\u2019s memory of the interviews and their \ninteractions with the participants, their personal and professional knowledge and their \u201cshifty \nselves as researchers\u201d, inevitably has an effect on the way they think.  This very much reflected \nwhat happened to me during the course of the study where my own thinking evolved in \nunexpected directions as a result of my experiences in conducting the research and becoming \nimmersed in the theory and data.  I note in the following chapters the instances where this \nhappened.   \n38 \n \n \nMethods \nI chose in-depth interviews as being the most suitable method of generating data for this study \nas they work well with an inductive approach when new and unknown information is being \nsought to fill a gap in knowledge about a topic (Pope & Mays, 2006; Rice & Ezzy, 1999).  A key \nadvantage of in-depth interviews is that they allow time for the perspective of one individual to \nbe explored in detail, so producing new knowledge through the interaction between the \ninterviewer and interviewee (Kvale 2007 cited in Liamputtong, 2013: 52). They also avoid a \nparticipant being interrupted or dominated by the ideas of another person as can sometimes \nhappen in focus groups.   Individual interviews within a constructionist epistemology allow the \nopportunity for new ideas which one participant may introduce to be taken forward into \nsubsequent interviews, thus developing the richness and depth of the data as the process \nproceeds (Green & Thorogood, 2009; Pope & Mays, 2006; Rice & Ezzy, 1999) For this study, \ninterviews were also the most practical method of generating data from supplement users, who \nwere not a defined group and who needed to be recruited individually over a relatively lengthy \nperiod of time.   \nIn qualitative research within a constructionist epistemology, the interviewer and participant \ncollaborate in generating the data as \u201cinteraction partners\u201d (Kelly, 2010: 308) and the resulting \ndata are explicitly understood to be the product of this interaction.  The relationship should be \nunderstood as one of reciprocity and co-creation where the researcher and participant make \ndifferent contributions to a matter of common interest, \u201cdeveloping and constructing new \nknowledge\u201d (Ben-Ari & Enosh, 2013: 246).  Subjectivity on the part of both interview partners \nneeds to be acknowledged (Liamputtong, 2013).  Interviews in this framework are not \ntransparent accounts, however, and can only record what participants say they think or do \nrather than being \u201ca direct window into their lives, thoughts, and meanings\u201d (Kelly, 2010: 309). \nMoreover, because it is the interaction between the researcher and participant that generates \nthe data, the interviewee may give a different account on another occasion, or to another \nresearcher, depending on the particular context for each one of them and the social, cultural \nand personal attributes that each one brings to the interview on the day (Liamputtong, 2013). \nInterviews need to be treated as \u2018accounts\u2019 rather than an objective report of firm beliefs (Green \n& Thorogood, 2009: 104).   \nThe circumstances in which the interview takes place have an important role in \u201cconstruct[ing] \nthe power and positionality of the participants\u201d (Elwood & Martin, 2000: 650).  It is more likely \n39 \n \n \nthat the interview will generate rich data if the participants feel comfortable, and that they will \nbe more guarded if they feel at any kind of disadvantage (Elwood & Martin, 2000; Sin, 2003).   It \nis well documented that the gender, ethnicity, age, nationality, and the social and educational \nstatus of both the researcher and participants influence the way the researchers present \nthemselves to the participants and how the participants react to them (Green & Thorogood, \n2009:107; Kelly, 2010:309; Liamputtong, 2013:71). Ensuring that participants are able to choose \nthe venue and time of the interview and paying attention to matters such as choice of language \nand even dress may all contribute to putting the participant at their ease.   The cautions about \nthe power differential usually assume that the researcher is the one whose power is the greater, \nand while this may often be the case (Ben-Ari & Enosh, 2013), it may also be the reverse, where \na participant feels the researcher is of lesser importance or professional standing than \nthemselves, and does not take them seriously (Harvey, 2010; Neal & McLaughlin, 2009). Even \nthough the researcher has set the agenda by their choice of topic and asks the questions, the \ngeneration of data depends on how well the researcher is able to build rapport between \nthemselves and the interviewee to establish a sympathetic relationship and sense of mutual \ntrust (Karnieli-Miller et al., 2009: 283).  Moreover, the researcher is dependent on the \nparticipants\u2019 agreement to take part and the degree of openness with which they choose to \nshare their experiences, so the power differential can be weighted in their favour if they decide, \nfor any reason, to limit their cooperation. Once the researcher has the data, however, the power \nlies with the researcher who takes away the participants\u2019 words and works with them to \ntranscribe them, select what they find to be salient, analyse and interpret what they find.  \nIn arranging the interviews for my study, I tried to address all these factors as best as I could and \nin the light of my previous experience of conducting many interviews with a diverse range of \npeople over the years. All participants received information about the study before the interview \nand had consented to participate.  Each of them was invited to choose the time and venue \nwhere the interview would take place.  Most of the participants had busy lives and by \ninterviewing them individually I was able to accommodate myself to their schedule rather than \nask them to work around mine.  Most of them chose to invite me into their own environment, \nwhether their home or workplace.  A few chose to come to my office either for the convenience \nof the location or because I was able to provide a private room without interruptions.  Several \nchose a caf\u00e9 close to their workplace as they had no suitable space to talk privately where they \nworked and they needed to avoid disturbing the work of others.  It also ensured a higher level of \nconfidentiality for those participants with business interests who may have been reluctant to \n40 \n \n \ndisclose particular types of information in a more open forum such as a focus group or did not \nwish others to know they were participating.   \nThe words of the interviewees that are recorded and then transcribed to become data, however, \nare not a full reflection of what happens during an interview.  The transcriptions cannot convey \nin totality the emphases and tone of the participants, or their use of humour and irony, their \nfacial expressions and body language, and the ambience of the setting in which the interview \ntakes place.  These can perhaps to some extent be captured by interpolating a phrase in brackets \nto indicate laughing or underlining to indicate emphasis but are still a relatively pale reflection of \nthe dynamics of the interview, which all, to some extent remain with me to this day.  However, it \nwas the unexpected addition to the spoken word that proved so influential in the course of the \nstudy which prompted me to look beyond the limits of the spoken data itself and allow room for \nthe material things that formed a significant presence in so many of the interviews.  These \nincluded displays of supplements participants showed me, websites they opened up for my \nbenefit, and brochures and other printed material they gave me.  This aspect became \nincreasingly pertinent as the interviews progressed and I came to see that these \u2018extras\u2019, though \nunexpected, were also part of the overall data.  During the study I also collected and made an \ninformal study of the free magazines distributed widely in Christchurch by a health store chain, \nfinding the language and images they used to promote their products of particular interest as \nwell as the products themselves.     \nThe sample  \nFor this study, absolute numbers were less relevant than being able to hear the perceptions of a \ndiverse range of people in terms of gender, ethnicity, and age as well as socio-economic and \ncultural backgrounds, within the constraints of what I could realistically expect to achieve within \nthe scope of a PhD study.  Guidance from qualitative methods texts indicates that there is no set \nformula for deciding on the number of participants (Liamputtong, 2013).  The key points are that \nthe number should be sufficient to explore the research questions in depth within a broad \nspectrum of opinion so as to obtain \u201cas full a range of observations of the phenomenon as \npossible\u201d (Charmaz 2004: 986 cited in Bourgeault et al., 2010: 9) from people who would be \nmost likely to contribute information-rich data (Green & Thorogood, 2009: 138; Kelly, 2010: \n317). Liamputtong (2013: 19) recommends continuing to recruit additional participants until no \nnew information is being generated, the state known as data saturation.  It has been suggested \nthat this may occur with as few as twelve participants (Guest et al., 2006). However, there are \n41 \n \n \nother considerations, such as the scope of the project, the type of research question, the \navailable pool of participants from which to recruit, and the amount of useful data generated in \neach interview (Hagaman & Wutich, 2017; Hennink et al., 2017; O'Reilly & Parker, 2013).  Even \nthough The New Zealand study (Ministry of Health, 2009) was already five years old at the time \nof recruitment of participants and is even older now, it was the only New Zealand wide study \navailable, was therefore locally relevant and provided a clear definition of dietary supplements.  \nAccording to the 2009 survey, \u2018regular\u2019 users - defined as  those who took a supplement or \nherbal medicine more frequently than once a week \u2013 were more likely to be female than male, \nolder rather than younger, and of non- M\u0101ori, non-Pacific ethnicity.  Without any defined user \ngroup to be approached, however, I found I needed a combination of methods to recruit \nparticipants, something which is not unusual in qualitative research (Liamputtong, 2013: 20).  \n   \nIn accordance with the focus of my study, the participants I recruited needed to be using \nsupplements more frequently than once a week for a specific health reason or for supporting \ntheir general wellbeing.  I made it clear that I was not studying protein powders or sports \nsupplements for performance enhancement.  I began by using snowball sampling, the method \nwhere a researcher selects an initial few participants whom they know meet the criteria and ask \nthem to recommend others who might be interested in taking part (Liamputtong, 2013). \nSnowball sampling is suitable for studies where there is no identifiable group that can be \napproached and participants are relatively difficult to locate.  I recruited the first four \nparticipants from known contacts who had already expressed an interest in my study.  Each of \nmy four initial participants came from a different background; two were known to each other \n(though each was unaware the other was participating in the study); each of the other two were \nself-employed, and were unknown to any of the other three.  This approach was only \nmoderately successful in recruiting a further group of participants. However, one of these initial \nparticipants introduced me to the organisers of a M\u0101ori hui (community meeting), and was able \nto get permission for me to talk about my study there and appeal for volunteers to participate. \nThis was successful in enabling me to recruit further M\u0101ori participants.  After that I simply \napproached people I had contact with through my current and previous workplaces, and people \nI came across on social occasions or through interest groups that I and other members of my \nfamily belonged to.  I focused on those I considered were more likely to put me in touch with \npeople from different age groups and with different cultural and social backgrounds.  I had been \nprepared to advertise on noticeboards or use social media, but this did not prove necessary.  An \nunexpected issue that arose in the course of recruiting was that a number of my friends and \n42 \n \n \nacquaintances took a keen interest in my study and wanted to participate themselves.  I had to \nexplain that it was not appropriate to include people whom I knew well or include too many \nparticipants who were too much like me, and turn them down as tactfully as possible.   \nI had planned to include people who sold supplements and/or provided advice about them in \npharmacies and health stores so as to get another perspective on the way people approached \nthe buying of supplement products. I wanted to find out the kind of queries they received, what \nadvice they provided, and more generally how they decided what products to stock, and if they \nobserved trends in the rise and fall of sales of particular products.  I excluded supermarkets and \nonline sales outlets even though supplements are easily (and often more cheaply) available from \nboth sources, as I was interested in the face-to-face contact between buyers and sellers.  \nHowever, I discovered fairly quickly that my assumptions about the users and sellers of \nsupplements being two distinct categories had been too simplistic; people\u2019s roles were much \nmore complex and blurred across the spectrum of user/advisor/provider/seller than I had \nsupposed.  So while I did approach a number of retail businesses directly in recruiting, and used \na different information sheet for them, the concept of two separate categories of participants \nproved to be unsustainable.  All but a very small minority of those who sold or advised on \nsupplements also spoke at length about their own use.  As well, a considerable number of the \nparticipants who initially presented themselves as users when approached for the study, also \nproved to have a stake in selling or recommending supplements in some way.  Several had \ncurrent or previous experience as providers of different kinds of alternative therapies (medical \nherbalism, acupuncture, homeopathy), and some were currently or had previously been \ninvolved in network marketing of supplements and herbal products through international \ncompanies.  There proved to be a two-way avenue into these mixed roles; some had begun \nselling or promoting products as a business venture or being assigned to a workplace role and \nthen begun to find the products useful for themselves; others had been users and subsequently \nhad taken on working in a business as their interest in the area grew and to offset the cost of \ntheir own supplies.    \nThese methods were ultimately successful in recruiting a total of 37 participants, all but two \nfrom within Canterbury and two from a connection in the Auckland region.  One participant \nsubsequently asked to withdraw, leaving a total of 36 participants:  23 women and 13 men \nranging in age from their early 20s to late 70s.  There were five participants with M\u0101ori and two \nwith Pacific ethnicity; five were originally from countries other than New Zealand.  Most were \ncurrently employed full or part time; six were officially retired but three of these also ran a part-\n43 \n \n \ntime small business selling supplements.  All but five participants lived in the greater \nChristchurch area and three of these lived rurally.  I did not ask participants their exact age, their \neducational background or financial status, as I considered it irrelevant to the study, and that it \nwould therefore have been over intrusive.  I was confident that this number of participants \nensured a diverse range of perspectives as the participants easily covered the main \ncharacteristics that had been listed in the New Zealand study and included others as well.  All \ninterviewees were sent the information sheet judged to be more relevant to their primary \ninvolvement with supplements (i.e. as a user or seller) prior to the interview (Appendix A,C), and \na consent form to read and sign (Appendix B,D).  An interview guide was developed as an aide \nmemoire for areas to be explored during the interview and to ensure that none were omitted \n(Appendix E).     \nEthical approval and M\u0101ori consultation \nEthical considerations are important for protection of the participants, to ensure that they are \nfully informed and that there is no pressure put on them to consent to take part.  For this study, \nthe ethics application outlined the purpose of the study, the general nature of the questions, \nand noted that participants could refuse to answer any particular question, or could withdraw \nfrom the study at any time without explanation up until the submission of the thesis.  Issues of \nconfidentiality were covered; that participants would not be identified by name, initials, \noccupation or location in the thesis or any subsequent publication, and that their identity would \nnot be disclosed to any other participant.  It was noted, however, that the use of snowball \nsampling as one method of recruitment meant that a recommender would potentially know the \nidentity of another individual who had been approached to participate. The ethics application \nalso set out the arrangements for ensuring that the audio recordings and completed transcripts \nwould be held securely and only seen by myself and my two supervisors.  Consultation with the \nM\u0101ori Research Advisor of the University of Otago, Christchurch was also carried out, and on her \nadvice I undertook to include M\u0101ori participants in the study in proportion to their percentage of \nthe population in the region, at the time, approximately 7% (Statistics New Zealand, 2013). The \nparticipants I subsequently recruited comfortably met this requirement.  The ethics application \nwas submitted and approval was subsequently confirmed by the University of Otago Human \nEthics Committee in June 2014. Ethics reference number: D14/187.   \n44 \n \n \nThe interview process \nI began each interview by going over the consent form and the purpose of the study.  After these \npreliminaries the order of discussion varied as a number of interviewees began to tell me their \nideas about their supplement use as soon as I arrived, even before I could ask the first question.  \nHowever, the flexibility of the semi-structured approach meant it was not a problem to move \nbetween the areas of interest in any order.  Five initial interviews were carried out during the \nmonths of August and September 2014.  These were recorded and transcribed in full before \ngoing any further, to allow for some preliminary analysis and reflection on the content and to \nidentify any further areas that should be explored with subsequent participants.  This process of \nmoving back and forth between examining the data and then conducting further interviewing \nallows the researcher to examine and reflect on the data generated so far (Liamputtong, 2013). \nIt allows refinements and adjustments if needed to the interviewing technique, and the ideas \nfrom the initial interviews taken forward to generate new areas for discussion and data \ngeneration.  This process can also prove to be \u201ca healthy corrective for built in blind spots\u201d \n(Liamputtong, 2013: 242).  The remaining participants were interviewed between mid-January \nand mid-October 2015.    All participants were given a $30 petrol voucher for their participation \nin the research.    \nAt the end of each interview I explained the arrangements about returning transcripts so that \ninterviewees could review them and comment further if they wished.  Forbat and Henderson \n(2005) discuss at length the appropriateness and complexities of returning verbatim transcripts \nto participants.  They note that the purpose is not to check the accuracy or truthfulness of the \naccount generated, but can be fruitful in allowing participants to reflect further on the topic as \nwell as providing a check on details, for example if words have been misheard in the \ntranscription. They and others have pointed out that there are challenges for participants in \nrevisiting the interview in written form and the process is not unproblematic, with participants \nsometimes feeling embarrassed about what they had said or how they had said it (Forbat & \nHenderson, 2005; Karnieli-Miller et al., 2009) and becoming concerned at how they would be \nrepresented in the finished document.  Corden and Sainsbury (2006) also studied participant \nreaction to verbatim excerpts in completed research reports, finding that opinions were divided \non whether or not they should be \u2018tidied\u2019 up.  While some preferred the oral account to be \nrepresented exactly as it had been said, others felt that unedited excerpts of their interviews \npresented them in a negative light as being uneducated or unattractive, and would mean that \ntheir comments would not be taken seriously.  My experience in a previous study had been \n45 \n \n \nconsistent with the latter response, and based on this as well as the literature, I believed a \nlimited amount of \u2018tidying\u2019 was warranted.  I transcribed all interviews verbatim myself, though I \nmade the decision to omit the \u2018fillers\u2019 such as \u2018I mean\u2019, and \u2018you know\u2019 where I felt these added \nnothing to the meaning.  The decision also had a practical basis in that omitting these filler \nphrases helped speed the transcribing, particularly in cases where the participant used them \nnumerous times. In my covering email with the transcripts I warned participants that oral speech \nwas likely to look different from a written document when transcribed, and as long as the \nmeaning was clear, any disjointed phrases or repetitions were no reflection on their credibility.  I \nalso drew their attention to the fact that my own questions were sometimes disjointed and took \ncare not to edit my own questions to look smoothly phrased when they had not been.  \nNevertheless, one participant did spend the time editing their transcript before returning it to \nme some months later.     \nWhen I had completed all interviewing and transcribing I prepared a descriptive overview of the \nmain ideas that had come from the interview data but without any verbatim excerpts from the \ntranscripts and sent it out to all participants.  As it was going to be several years before the final \nthesis was ready, I believed it was important to acknowledge their contribution to the research \nby sharing my findings in this preliminary way.  Somewhat disappointingly, I received only one or \ntwo brief acknowledgements thanking me for sending it but no comments on the content.  It \nwas a salutary reminder for me that while I was to spend the next few years thinking in depth \nabout what they had said, being interviewed for my study was likely to have been a passing \nevent of little importance in their lives and they would have long since moved on from that day. \nCompiling the overview, however, was helpful as a basis from which to approach the analysis.  I \nassigned pseudonyms to each of my participants, as a means of retaining their anonymity but \nbeing more interesting and recognisable in a lengthy text than referring to them by a participant \nnumber. \nAnalytical approach \nI had originally intended to conduct a critical thematic analysis, that is, coding the data in a \nsystematic iterative process to identify recurring themes as described in the literature by various \nauthors on qualitative methods (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Green & Thorogood, 2009; Pope & Mays, \n2006).  Essentially this means taking an aspect of the data and summarising it using a particular \nword, phrase, or theme.  For example, the idea of having personal control over one\u2019s health, \nwhich was mentioned in various ways by many of the interviewees, could be represented as \n46 \n \n \n\u2018control\u2019 whenever this idea appeared in the transcripts.  Once the major themes were \nidentified, I would draw from the theoretical and other literature to present an in-depth and \nnuanced analysis, supported by the data, to develop an understanding of how people use \ndietary supplements and herbal medicines to care for their own health, and how this fits with \ncontemporary ideas of maintaining health and preventing illness.  I could easily have identified \nand presented several major themes and patterns from the interview data in an analysis based \non this type of coding.  Sections would have included, for example, personal empowerment by \ntaking control over one\u2019s own health; holistic health care versus the biomedical model of health; \nthe concept of natural versus artificial therapeutic products; and the influence of marketing on \nhealth conscious consumers.  My summary for the participants included all these aspects and \nseveral more.   All these ideas, however, had already been identified and explored to some \nextent in the literature, even though supplements were very often treated as just one of the \nmodalities in studies of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) users in general (Barrett \net al., 2003; Brosnan et al., 2018; Furnham, 2002; Lewis, 2019; Stoneman et al., 2013). While it \ncould be argued that a more intensive analysis of these themes, or examining them in \ncombination with one another might add to the body of literature, it seemed unlikely that it \nwould deepen thinking about the underlying personal and societal forces at play within and \naround the topic.   \nDuring the interview process I became more and more convinced that limiting my analysis to an \niterative thematic approach based only on the spoken data would be a mechanistic and \nunsatisfactory way of capturing the wide range of complex ideas and the connections and \ndisconnections between them that had been generated through my interaction with the \nparticipants.  Brinkman\u2019s remark (2014) that he experienced \u201castonishment, mystery and \nbreakdowns in understanding\u201d resonated with the way I felt as I reflected on the experiences \nover the 14 months of interviewing.  Limiting the analysis to the transcribed words of the \nparticipants alone would certainly fail to do justice to some of the non-verbal elements of my \ncontact with them that I have already mentioned above.  I wanted to capture the new \npossibilities that might be developed using a different approach from simply relying on \nconventional coding.  Jackson and Mazzei (2012: 12) make the case for moving beyond coding \nalone, arguing that the focus on reducing the different codes into a few \u201cmacro\u201d codes \u201clocks us \ninto more of a territorialized placed of fixed, recognizable meaning\u201d  limited by the current \nknowledge of the participants and the researcher and works against the production of new \nknowledge.   \n47 \n \n \nI needed to find an approach that would offer something different and at another level from the \nstudies I had already examined and which would include more than just the recorded data from \nthe discussions with the participants.  I did this in a two stage process.  The first stage was to do \na preliminary coding exercise, which was helpful in allowing me to familiarise myself with the \ninterview data in its entirety.  It also provided the basis for the descriptive overview (see \nprevious section) that I sent out to the participants.  However, I then, under the guidance of my \nsupervisors, turned to Jackson and Mazzei\u2019s (2012) concept of \u2018thinking with theory\u2019.  These \nauthors propose that through a process of \u201carranging, organising, fitting together\u201d (Jackson & \nMazzei, 2012: 1), the data, relevant theoretical concepts, the variety of actants that are involved \nin a phenomenon, as well as the researcher\u2019s own prior knowledge and the recollections they \ntake away from their contact with the research participants generates  \u201csomething new, \nsomething different, from mere themes and patterns generated by coding (Jackson & Mazzei, \n2012: 6).   \nThis idea from Jackson and Mazzei resonated with me as I had the same rich assemblage of \nprevious personal and professional experiences, the transcribed data, memories of the \ninterviews with the participants and especially of the way they engaged with the material \nsubstances of their supplements.  I wanted to be able to take the whole experience into account, \nnot just the transcribed words of the participants which I believed were of course, important, \nbut only one part of the whole.  MacLure (2015: 106-107) too, draws attention to the limitations \nof analyses that privilege the spoken word without taking into account how discourse is \nintermingled with \u201cmatter, affect and virtuality\u201d.  She acknowledges that this involves giving up \nthe safety and comfort of well-known methodology and casting oneself into an adventure into \nthe unknown.  I did not find I needed to jettison the results of the coding exercise entirely, but \nrather to take them forward into a second stage of analysis where I was able to incorporate both \ndiscourse and materiality by exploring them using different theoretical concepts.   \nThis proved, however, to be more than just one step into the unknown but an ongoing process \nof exploring new territory throughout much of the writing of the thesis.  Little did I know when I \nbegan, what a broad range of literature in diverse subject areas and how many theoretical ideas \nI would need to read and think about during the study.  The trajectory of my own understanding \nof the theoretical ideas I came across, in particular, changed my way of thinking about \nqualitative research entirely.   My initial ideas about the quest (see Chapter 2) became a \npersonal journey that had rich discoveries but also many difficult and thorny paths.  I was \nconstantly reminded that while I was making observations about other people and things and \n48 \n \n \nwriting about them, I was also contemporaneously in a process of my own quest, striking out \ninto new territories as I learned about the theoretical ideas I had chosen to use, and grappled \nwith understanding them and putting them to work in analysing my research in a convincing \nway.  The next section gives a brief overview of the theoretical framing that I chose to work with.   \nTheoretical framing  \nThe theoretical framework for the analysis draws from Deleuze and Guatttari\u2019s concept of the \nrhizomatic network of actants that are interconnected in a moving assemblage around a \nparticular phenomenon (Deleuze & Guatarri, 1987)8.   Assemblages are not a domain of reality or \na \u2018thing\u2019, but are a process that designates movement and transformation (Jackson and Mazzei \n2012:1; Latour 2005:64).  The rhizomatic network takes its inspiration from the botanical world.  \nBamboo, the ginger plant, couch grass, and the mushroom mycelium are all examples of \nrhizomes, that is, structures which are made up of an untidy, tangled network of nodes and \nconnections and that spread out randomly, largely under the ground, with no apparent starting \nor finishing point.  Like the botanical rhizome, Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s conceptual rhizome is \nsimilarly made up of heterogeneous threads (Holland, 2013) that are in a constant process of \nspreading into new areas without any regular pattern or organised structure.  The rhizomatic \nnetwork has been described as a \u201cchaotic network of habitual and non-habitual connections, \nalways in flux, always reassembling in different ways\u201d (Potts, 2004: 19) like \u201ca crazy patchwork \nquilt\u201d (Holland, 2013: 37).  Any thread in the rhizome can be connected to any other one, and \nthe threads can merge or split apart (Dewsbury, 2011), breaking away in a new direction, yet \nremaining connected to where they came from.    \nI have applied the concept of the rhizomatic network to my study as a way of thinking about the \nmultiple actants that come together in the assemblage around supplements and their use.  \nThese include the individual people, their cultural background and personal experiences, their \nrelationships with others, and the products, discourses, regulations, and commercial activities, \nall of which are temporarily in a dynamic relationship with one another.  Each of these actants is \nconnected to the others in some way, and as the supplement assemblage evolves over time with \nnew products, users, information and events coming in, the actants within it change it and are \nchanged by it.  This process of constant flux was described by Deleuze and Guattari as \n\u201cmovements of deterritorialisation and processes of reterritorialisation that are always \n                                                          \n8 I used a 2013 reprint of A Thousand Plateaus but have not indicated this in the reference to avoid the \nclumsy 2013 [1987] being repeated multiple times.  \n49 \n \n \nconnected, caught up in one another\u201d (Deleuze & Guatarri, 1987: 9). In other words, some \nproducts or ideas fall out of fashion (are deterritorialised) and others move in to take over their \nspace (reterritorialise); the new developments are seeded from the experience and knowledge \nthat went before them which is never entirely discarded or \u2018unlearned.\u2019  Moreover, the previous \nactants may \u2018reterritorialise\u2019 in a newly animated form that fits with the discourses of the time.  \nAs a current example, one need only think of the way the cloth and jute shopping bags of former \ndecades have reterritorialised the space left vacant by the plastic ones that were dominant for \nso long but are now being \u2018deterritorialised\u2019 by current environmental concerns. These changes \nin the rhizomatic assemblage may build incrementally in a constant slow process, or at times \nmay also be abrupt and swift.  These are the unexpected developments that Deleuze and \nGuattari described as \u201clines of flight\u201d:   \nThere is a rupture in the rhizome whenever segmentary lines explode into a line of flight, \nbut the line of flight is part of the rhizome (Deleuze & Guatarri, 1987: 9).     \nThe \u2018explosion\u2019 indicates a dramatic shift; perhaps a chance discovery or random encounter.  Yet \neven while there is a transformative change in one direction, the connection to the overall \nnetwork remains in place.  As a practical illustration of this concept Deleuze and Guattari (1987: \n10) used the example of a virus which can \u201ctake flight, move into the cells of a different species \nbut not without bringing with it genetic information from the first host.\u201d Deleuze suggested that \nhis theories should be used like a box of tools to \u201cpry open vacant spaces\u201d (Massumi, 1992: 8). \nDeleuze himself used his toolbox to examine areas as diverse as linguistics, geology, \npsychoanalysis, and music but the ideas can equally be applied to \u201cany body of choice:  a sexual \nbody; a bicycle; a language, a body of art, a film\u201d \u2013 the concepts work for them all\u201d (Malins, \n2004: 85). The aim of using Deleuze\u2019s toolkit to pry things open is not to define how things are in \nthe world or what they mean in a bounded way, but to trace their tendencies and how they \nevolve \u2013 their way of becoming (Holland, 2013).  \nThe concept of the rhizomatic assemblage of actants is used throughout the analysis and \ndiscussion of the thesis to conceptualise the in-process nature of the supplement assemblage \nand its constant state of moving away from sameness to become something different.  This \n\u201cphilosophy of immanence\u201d as Jackson and Mazzei (2012: 87) have termed it, has no absolutes \nor boundaries but embraces the idea of flow and change (Dovey, 2011). Becoming, with its \nnature of being always \u201cau milieu\u201d - in process (Deleuze, 1997: 226), is not understood as going \ntowards a designated destination.  It is a \u201cstream without beginning or end\u201d (Deleuze and \nGuattari 1987: 27) that operates in the spaces in between.  It is not an essence or a position but \n50 \n \n \na tendency, an orientation to change (Holland 2013: 34). It opens up the possibility of competing \ninterpretations, avoids attempting to create categories and definitions and brings into view the \nambiguities that are threaded through people\u2019s lives (Biehl & Locke, 2010).     \nWithin this overall framework, I have taken an eclectic approach, drawing on a range of other \ntheoretical concepts as they became appropriate. Examining the data from a range of different \nperspectives as I worked through the analysis, was somewhat akin to shaking up the pieces of a \nkaleidoscope, revealing new patterns that emerge from the same fragments of material when \nthey are arranged differently.  While this approach was important and useful, it was also \nchallenging, because separating some actants from the whole assemblage was, to some extent, \ncounter to the whole idea of the inextricably interconnected nature of their relationship with \none another.   Aspects from one chapter constantly threatened to intrude on others and risk \nrepetition, and yet structuring the thesis required some form of separating them out in order to \navoid becoming overwhelmed with trying to write about them all at once.   \nEach of the next three chapters discusses in turn one major theme that proved to be integral to \nthe overall thesis.  Chapter Four investigates and deconstructs the discourses around \nsupplements that were raised by the participants. Chapter Five then examines the role of the \nmaterial products of the supplements in the participants\u2019 lives.  Chapter Six looks at the way \nparticipants developed a sense of power in their decisions about their health management \nthrough combining their experiences of supplement use with ideas of personal responsibility, \nexpertise, and narratives of identity.   The discussion chapter brings all these ideas together \u2013 \ndiscourse, materiality, and power - to show how they form a new way of understanding \nsupplements and those who use them.   \n  \n51 \n \n \nChapter 4: Natural, holistic and safe: deconstructing discourses \nabout supplements \nIntroduction \nIn the discussions I had with the participants, many of them spoke about the particular qualities \nof supplements as being the reason why they used them; that they were natural, holistic and \nsafe.  They also contrasted these qualities in terms of what supplements were not; that is, not \nartificial or made from \u2018chemicals\u2019, not narrowly focused on biomedical health, and not risky.  On \nthe surface, these remarks seemed to add little to what had been reported in previous studies \n(Durante et al., 2001; Rozin et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2006; Vickers et al., 2006).   However, \nexamining the data closely, it was clear that even though the participants seemed to understand \nthat these qualities were self-evident and uncontested, they interpreted them in widely varying \nways. This chapter, therefore, aims to get beyond the assumptions in previous studies that have \ntaken these qualities of supplements for granted and by deconstructing them, to show \u201cthe \ntensions and omissions which have been produced without interrogation\u201d (Jackson and Mazzei, \n2012: 15).   \nTo think more deeply about the way these concepts were expressed by the participants, this \nchapter draws on theoretical concepts from Derrida\u2019s (1997) writing on deconstruction. While \ndeconstructing the binaries in the debate around these three concepts is hardly new (see for \nexample, (Anderson, 2009; Lupton, 1999; Thorne, 2001; Tulloch & Lupton, 2003), it has not \nnecessarily been applied to supplements and herbal medicines in any detail.  The basic concept \nof deconstruction is that things \u2013 whether beliefs, practices, institutions, texts or anything else - \ndo not have exactly determinable meanings and are always more than they currently seem \n(Caputo, 1997). For Derrida, there is no such thing as a bounded definition; everything has \ndifferences within it and the more one tries to tie anything down and limit it, the more it slips \naway from \u201c\u2026every attempt to totalize, to gather\u2026\u201d (Derrida, 1997: 13), to bring things together \nand make them into a totality that closes off possibilities for difference, development and \nchange.  Deconstruction, on the other hand, means being open to different understandings, new \ninterpretations and to meanings that are emerging as well as those that are current.  It does not \nmean simply tearing things apart into multiplicity or disassociation.  That would mean only \n\u201canarchistic relativism\u201d (Caputo, 1997: 36) where words or texts could mean anything the reader \nwanted them to mean. On the contrary, deconstruction should be \u201caffirmative, not in a way that \n52 \n \n \nis simply positive\u2026 repeating the given\u201d (Derrida, 1997: 5-6) but transformative, opening [the \nthing examined] to the future. It must reveal what is not obvious, unspoken or overlooked:   \n\u2026something in the text which tends to drop out of view [which can]\u2026open things up, to \nfind a way to read \u201cotherwise\u201d (autrement) in the name of the incoming of the other \n(l\u2019invention de l\u2019autre) (Derrida, 1997: 77). \nI understand Derrida\u2019s writing on deconstruction to mean that nothing is fixed in a state where it \nis utterly stable and consistent through and through; there are always differences and shades of \nmeaning that can be revealed.   \nSeeing things as fluid in this way, transforms the kind of attitudes that seek to shut down \ndifferences as being threatening and instead welcomes them because they indicate multiplicity, \nevolution and refreshment.   \nWe do not have to choose between unity and multiplicity \u2026you see, pure unity or pure \nmultiplicity \u2013 when there is only totality or unity and when there is only multiplicity or \ndisassociation \u2013 is a synonym of death\u2026.A culture is different from itself; language is \ndifferent from itself; the person is different from itself.  Once you take into account this \ninner and other difference then you pay attention to the other (Derrida, 1997: 13-14). \nDerrida rejected the criticism of his theory of deconstruction as being a negative concept and \nemphasised that it was a productive process, that used \u201cthe tension between memory, fidelity, \nthe preservation of something that has been given to us, and at the same time, heterogeneity, \nsomething absolutely new, and a break\u201d (Derrida, 1997: 6).    \nFor this study, deconstructing the concepts of naturalness, holistic health and safety from risk \nmeant carefully examining the participants\u2019 remarks on these qualities of supplements to see \nhow they unsettled the dominant interpretations about them as being concepts that \u2018everyone\u2019 \nunderstood in the same way  (Jackson & Mazzei, 2012).  It meant being alert to the wide \nspectrum of views that were expressed in the discussions with the participants, as well as paying \nattention to the nuances that were implied but less directly stated.   It meant noticing that some \nparticipants implicitly engaged in their own form of deconstruction, offering both \ncomplementary and competing explanations about the qualities of supplements in the course of \ntheir remarks.  It did not mean undermining or negating what any of them said or treating some \nremarks as insignificant, but opening up the ideas around the qualities of supplements to show \nhow they were evolving.     \n53 \n \n \nUsing deconstruction within the wider framework of Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s rhizomatic \nassemblage that underpins this study overall allows it to act as a force that diversifies the \nassemblage of actants.  Rather than competing ideas participants put forward about naturalness, \nfor example, being put aside as outliers because they were inconsistent with one another, all \ninterpretations had their place among the heterogeneous components of the assemblage.  This \ndiversification resulted in an exponentially greater capacity for connections to be made between \nthe components, which in turn could be seen to be changing the way that the supplement \nassemblage was spreading out in different directions as it evolved.   \nAccording to Bearn (2000, 2013), the crucial difference between Derrida and Deleuze is that \nDerrida sees deconstruction within a framework of success or failure.  Opening up to the \u2018other\u2019, \naccording to Derrida (1997: 6), \u201cthis newness, this novelty is a risk \u2026 it is guaranteed by no \nprevious rules.\u201d Deleuze, in contrast, moves right outside the framework of winning or losing in \nthe \u2018game of existence\u2019 and \u201cthe point of the game floats away, leaving us just playing\u201d (Bearn, \n2013: 53-54).  Using both Derrida and Deleuze to think about supplements, then, is a way of \nlooking at supplements as ongoing health practices, comprised of multiple components, that are \nundertaken in the course of individual lives, not focused on any particular end point, and which \nare always in process, \u201cin the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo\u201d (Deleuze and \nGuattari, 1987:26).  This approach avoids deciding whether deconstructing the discourses \naround supplements \u2018succeeds\u2019 or not.  Instead, it shows the variety of interpretations around \nthe common discourses about supplements to be unique interconnections that individuals make \nbetween the many  components in the assemblage, mobilizing them according to what they do \nin their everyday life, the \u201cplastic habits \u2026 dynamics and ruptures \u2026 that affect bodily states, \nmodes of attention, and ways of experiencing time and space\u201d (Dewsbury, 2011: 149, 150).   \nThe chapter has three major sections which deconstruct in turn the discourses of naturalness, \nholistic health, and safety from risk.  In each of the three sections I have firstly examined the \nparticipants\u2019 comments to show the way they unsettled the assumed meaning of each of these \nqualities and showed up the \u201cabsent present\u2026which has been ignored in an attempt to preserve \nthe illusion of truth as a perfectly self-contained and self-sufficient present\u201d (Jackson and \nMazzei, 2012: 18).  I then look at the evolving assemblage of actants that surrounded the idea of \nsupplements as natural, holistic and safe: the products themselves, what the participants said \nabout them, what they said about their own background, relationships, attitudes and \nexperiences of health and life, their reference to discourses in wider society, and their use of \ninformation.  I show that there were both commonalities and differences in the way the \n54 \n \n \nparticipants thought about the natural, holistic and safe qualities of their supplements, drawing \nfrom the past but moving and changing as the participants themselves moved on with their lives, \nbeing influenced by new experiences and new social discourses.  To conclude, the chapter looks \nat the three assemblages as part of a greater and even more tangled assemblage where all these \nconnections are intimately linked in shifting arrangements that are always changing, a process \nwhich Bearn (2013: 53) terms \u201cthe liquid time of becoming.\u201d This resonated not only with the \nstudy participants as individuals who were striving to pursue a healthy life, but also with the idea \nof the life quest, where individuals evolve in themselves through the \u2018becomings\u2019 that take place \non the journey.   \nNature and naturalness   \nThat supplements and herbal medicines are \u2018natural\u2019 is arguably the most dominant discourse \naround these products and one which formed a frequent topic in the discussions with the \nparticipants.  Many of them expressed straightforward views that constructed natural products \nas being simpler and better for them.   \nI just liked the more natural kind of things rather than getting too carried away with pills \nand potions.  I like them to be a bit more natural.  \u2026 I went to a herbalist \u2026 and they \nwould recommend things if I had something wrong \u2026 if you had a sore throat they would \nrecommend this might actually be better for you rather than having something that\u2019s got \nchemicals in it.  I guess if I was given the option I would rather something that was \nnatural. (Johnny) \nJohnny here seems to assume that there is a standard meaning of what is natural and that the \ntwo of us who are discussing the issue share an understanding about the positive benefits that it \nbrings to mind. Johnny is not unusual in contemporary times in the way he talks about \nnaturalness, as others have also remarked (Devcich et al., 2007; Li & Chapman, 2012; Rozin et \nal., 2012; Rozin et al., 2004).  Amos et al (2014: 268) suggest that labelling a product as natural \nevokes \u201csentimental pastoral associations\u201d for consumers that they transfer to the product \nitself, crediting it with being free of contamination and offering health benefits.  All kinds of \nproducts - fabrics, foods, construction materials \u2013 as well as supplements, draw on naturalness \nin promoting their benefits to consumers (Childs & Poryzees, 1998; L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki, 2013; Rozin et \nal., 2004). The closer one looks at what is \u2018natural\u2019, however, the more it demonstrates Derrida\u2019s \nnotion that there are \u201ctensions, contradictions, heterogeneity\u201d (1997: 9) within what appears on \nthe surface to be a single understanding.  Deconstructing the \u2018natural\u2019 reveals that it is deeply \n55 \n \n \nimbued with complex economic, cultural, social and political currents (Pawson & Brooking, \n2013), with many contested meanings, all of which depend to a greater or lesser extent on the \ncontrast between nature and humanity (Kellert, 1993; Rozin et al., 2004; Soper, 1998; Van \nKoppen, 2000).  \nNature has never been a neutral, value-free concept (Kearns & Gesler, 1998); it has been \nassociated with sacredness, beauty and peace, as well as fear and destruction.  So while nature \nis beautiful and beneficent it is also terrifying (Kellert, 1993). Awe and worship of the natural \nenvironment are considered the most ancient form of religious belief (Shibley, 2011; Snodgrass \n& Tiedje, 2008).   Many modern customs, too, both secular and religious, have their roots in \nancient rites associated with natural features such as springs, hills and rocks (Gesler, 1996: 102; \nStrang, 2004: 111). Yet nature also brings horror and death through cyclones, earthquakes, \nvolcanic eruptions, wildfires and floods.  So in spite of the positive associations that labelling of \nfood products and supplements draws on, for example, nature has many layers of meaning that \nhave differed across historical eras and varied between individuals according to their experience \nand attitudes to the world (Heintzman, 2009; Lee, 2010; Soper, 1995, 1998).  \nUntil relatively recently, mastering, and improving on nature was seen as a universal \u2018good\u2019 for \nthe human race because it increased the chance of survival in an unpredictable world where no \none, however wealthy or important, was exempt from sudden death through disease or the \nvagaries of natural events (Rozin et al., 2004).  During the late 19th and first half of the 20th \ncentury, however, major advances in engineering, science and food safety saw these fears \nmoderate as life became less uncertain (Stanziani, 2008). Longevity improved and confidence \nincreased in \u201cWestern models of progress\u201d (Soper, 1998: 5) which would improve on the natural \nworld through science and technology.   By the second half of the 20th century, however, it \nbecame clear that conquering nature was not an unalloyed good and that human disregard for \nthe importance of the natural eco-system had created a range of disastrous consequences (Beck, \n2000; Chapman et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2016; Meffe, 1992). Environmental and human \ndisasters such as the dust bowl in the US in the 1930s (Romm, 2011), the Bhopal chemical \nexplosion (Varma & Varma, 2005), and the nuclear accident at Chernobyl (Bouville et al., 2005; \nM\u00f8ller & Mousseau, 2006) to name just a few, saw a realisation that exploiting and damaging \nthe natural environment would ultimately rebound on humanity.   \nMore recently, the series of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, \n2019), and the linking of extreme weather events to human-induced climate change rather than \nto exclusively natural causes (Mann et al., 2017; Stott et al., 2016), have added even more \n56 \n \n \ncompellingly to the acknowledgement that the natural environment needs to be respected and \ncared for and that damage done will eventually have to be addressed. There has been a \nwidespread societal change in attitudes to environmental protection, encompassing several \nstrands of interwoven ideas.  Firstly, that natural resources need to be preserved for sustainable \nuse for future generations (Hansen et al., 2013; Holden et al., 2014); secondly, that human \nhealth and global environmental health are intimately linked (Rabinowitz & Conti, 2013; \nStephenson et al., 2013) and thirdly, that the natural environment and non-human species have \nan intrinsic value that humans have a moral responsibility to preserve (Batavia & Nelson, 2017; \nChan et al., 2016; Piccolo, 2017).  \nThese dominant, though not uncontested, social discourses appear to underpin the attitude to \nnature and natural things as pure, simple and superior to the non-natural (Amos, 2014; Li & \nChapman, 2012; Rozin et al., 2012).  One particular way that preference for natural things \nmanifests itself is in relation to substances that are ingested as food, drink and medicines (Aprile \net al., 2016; Li & Chapman, 2012; Saher et al., 2006; Thompson, 2003).  Johnny, in the excerpt \nabove, demonstrates this attitude in his comments, yet he also implicitly acknowledges that \nthere are gradations within naturalness.  He does not explain, for example, what he means by \u2018a \nbit more natural\u2019 and he constructs the herbalist\u2019s products as different from \u2018pills and potions\u2019  \nbecause they do not have \u2018chemicals\u2019 even though he may well take them, too, in the form of \npills or potions.   \nMany participants also seemed to see it as self-evident that \u2018natural products\u2019 and \npharmaceuticals were on separate sides of a divide in medicinal products and had their own idea \nof where the boundary between them should be drawn.  Prescribed medicines, constructed as \n\u2018drugs\u2019 were on the other side of that boundary for most of them and not thought of as natural \nproducts:    \nCertainly with the things I use for my family, I think I\u2019m doing the right thing. It\u2019s quite \nempowering in a way.  Because it\u2019s shown to be natural you feel like you\u2019re doing \nsomething \u2013 you\u2019re not pumping drugs into your body.  (Vonnie) \nIt is noticeable that Vonnie\u2019s use of the expression \u2018pumping drugs\u2019 calls to mind syringes and \nhospitals, which emphasise the sharp contrast she is making between the two constructs; one \ndraws on the idea of treating oneself with a simple product from nature, while the other draws \non concepts of interventionist medicine over which the individual has limited control.  Olivia \n57 \n \n \nbrought this out even more directly in her account of treating her child\u2019s eczema with a paste \nmade from chickweed (Stellaria media) from her own garden:   \nIn a couple of days it had gone.  You know, nothing else \u2013 we were trying all those \nremedies - we had gone to get those lipid creams, steroid stuff and then it would go and \nthen come back.  With this, a few days \u2013 a week and it was gone until maybe the next \nseason and we would try it again.  We did that a few seasons and it never came back \nagain.  (Olivia) \nOlivia makes her point by pointing to the clear contrast between the (natural) home-made \nherbal remedy and the (non-natural) \u2018steroid stuff\u2019 of the prescribed medicines. Yet a large \nnumber of prescription drugs are either directly plant-based or a chemically modified version of \ncompounds from plants, so that the difference between a natural health product and a \npharmaceutical medicine can be very small (Holt & MacDonald, 2008: 22-23).     \nA number of participants, however, without any prompting, commented on the indeterminate \nline between what was natural and what was not.  I did not specifically ask them to articulate \nwhat they meant by \u2018natural\u2019 but it is possible that participating in the study led them to think \nmore critically about their practices than before.  Whether or not this was the case, they \nengaged in their own form of deconstruction, reflecting on the competing meanings that \nexisted, including in their own practices.  \nHow natural is \u2018natural\u2019?    \nParticipants\u2019 comments ranged from the sceptical to the pragmatic and the (relatively) idealistic.   \nSome of them acknowledged that thinking of supplements as natural required a certain amount \nof willing suspension of disbelief, an awareness that the \u2018natural\u2019 label on a product was not \nsomething that stood up to investigation and could simply be a marketing tool.  Iris, for example, \nindicated that she chose not to think too deeply about the substances she took which were \n\u201cmeant to be all natural but it\u2019s in a powder so you have to wonder how natural that is\u201d.  Bryony \nshared Iris\u2019s scepticism about the products available for sale. She noted that though she bought \nso-called \u2018natural medicines\u2019 for herself and her family, they were usually powdered extracts in \ncapsules bought from a shop, and quite possibly made in a factory by the same company that \nmade pharmaceuticals:   \n Just because it is on a shelf and is labelled as natural doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have an \neffect on your whole body balance.  \u2026natural to me would be if I went and picked \n58 \n \n \nsomething and I could see all the bits of dried leaves and twigs and dried berries and \nmade some kind of something out of it and drink it.  To me that\u2019s natural. (Bryony) \nHowever, she acknowledged that this artisan ideal was unrealistic for her and most others, as \nthey would have neither the ingredients nor the desire to formulate their own products.   Her \ncompromise was to get products that were \u201cjust as close to natural as I can get in the form of \nmedicine that you get from a health food store or from a pharmacy.\u201d   As Bryony indicates here, \nif the original substances are going to be sold in shops, they need to be packaged into a stable \nformat that can be shipped to different destinations and still retain their active properties, but in \ndoing so they lose their completely \u2018natural\u2019 qualities.    Almost all participants relied on \ncommercially sold products and even for those few who made some of their own, it was only as \na complement to other products that they bought.     \nThe standardisation needed to produce and market herbal medicines on a large scale so that \nthey are consistently the same quality is another contested area which unsettles the idea of \n\u2018true\u2019 naturalness. The commercial marketing of supplements has been seen as distancing herbal \ntraditions from their craft-based origins in order to turn them into a globalised industry.  Some \nhave interpreted standardisation as being politically and economically motivated by \u201cseemingly \ninevitable biomedical hegemony\u201d (Singer & Fisher, 2007: 25) that wants to force traditional \nhealing modalities to \u201cplay the evidence game\u201d (Barry, 2006: 2650) and be brought within the \n\u201cstructurally dominant scientific paradigm\u201d (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003: 321). The contrasting \nview is that \u2018natural\u2019 (that is, alternative) and orthodox medical approaches have much to offer \neach other and that they can and should work together for mutual benefit.  Wahlberg (2008) for \nexample, supports the standardisation of plant extracts as being an avenue through which they \nmay be accepted as potential treatments available either within orthodox medicine or as an \nadditional support to what has been prescribed.  One of the pharmacist participants voiced a \nsimilar view; his experience was that an integrated approach provided a greater range of options \nand ultimately benefited his customers:   \n[the customer] would come with a prescription and say, well I don\u2019t know about this but \nanyway I was sort of thinking about another alternative, what is there?   And so you \nwould still support the doctor who prescribed it but on the other hand you could say, well \nthere are other options, maybe as a helper for what you have been given \u2026So in a sense \nit helps that person.  Or they will come in and say I\u2019ve heard that ginko biloba is really \ngood for the brain, what do you think about that?  (Lou) \n59 \n \n \nParticipants generally seemed to agree in principle with this practical, open approach.   They \ndrew from the assemblage of the natural whatever fitted with their own concept and they felt \nwas appropriate in a particular situation.  Although some of their comments indicated that they \nsaw natural products and prescribed medicines as ideologically separate categories, they \ngenerally seemed to take the view that having access to all kinds or products in both categories \ngave them greater choice.  Even those, like Vonnie, who made the comment about \u201cpumping \ndrugs into your body\u201d, were not averse to using prescribed medicines if they believed them \nappropriate to particular circumstances.  They appeared to see this as practical and realistic \nrather than being concerned that it was inconsistent with their views on naturalness.  Some did, \nhowever, comment on how disappointing it was that their doctors did not seem to have an \nequally open and flexible attitude to suggesting natural products as an option:  \nI feel I have had some really good doctors through the years, I just don\u2019t feel that they \never even give the option for the natural way forward.  It\u2019s usually, here\u2019s your whatever \nmedication it is. (Penny) \nAnother participant, Paul, drew attention to the way perceptions of a product could be \nmanipulated by a simple labelling change; privileging a popular or botanical name of a herbal \nproduct would point out its simplicity and naturalness, but the chemical name component could \nbe used in other circumstances to create a different impression:   \n\u2026because of having chemical names for everything, people are actually looking for it to \nbe simpler than that.  The ones in our shampoo are extracted from the palm tree.  The \nneem tree.  And the active ingredient in it has got a chemical name - Azarydin \n[Azadirachtin]. So, people say, are they chemical free?  But in actual fact they have got \nchemicals in them because everything has a chemical symbol of some sort. (Paul)   \nOther examples of constructing products using different discourses that frame them as either \n\u2018natural\u2019 or a \u2018chemical\u2019 product are also easy to find.  The wholesome sound of \u2018pure spring \nwater\u2019  or \u2018naturally fermented cider vinegar\u2019 on labels, for example, creates quite a different \nperception than if the same products are described as H2O  or E260 on another (Beebee & \nSabbarton-Leary, 2010; Plessi, 2003).  \nNaturalness is clearly not the \u201cperfectly self-contained and self-sufficient\u201d truth (Jackson and \nMazzei, 2012: 18) that it may appear to be on the surface.  The \u2018naturalness\u2019 of supplement \nproducts can easily be deconstructed to show the multiplicity of understandings and perceptions \nabout them that unsettle the idea of a dualistic division between them and prescribed \n60 \n \n \nmedicines.  While some participants appeared to accept their naturalness as being obvious and \nsimple, they also seemed well aware that labelling something as \u2018natural\u2019 did not necessarily \nmake it so.  Others were self-reflexive, presenting thoughtful insights about the inconsistencies \nin what they said and what they actually did in their practices with supplements.  The \nparticipants\u2019 comments reflected the tension and multiplicity that Derrida spoke about that keep \nideas alive and make them productive instead of closing them in on themselves.  \u2018Natural\u2019, it \nseemed, was a flexible enough descriptor to retain its overall salience as a concept but one that \ncould be interpreted from a variety of perspectives and fit a variety of circumstances.  As other \nwriters have also noted, while everyday understandings about the natural are imprecise and can \neasily be deconstructed, it is a mistake to overlook the sentiments that they give rise to; the \nconcept of naturalness has a broad and enduring appeal across cultural and philosophical \ndifferences, values and self-image (Johar & Siergy, 1991; Soper, 1998: 181).  \nImportantly, ideas about what was natural were in process of change. It was clear from talking to \nthe participants that their practices and the particular substances they thought of as natural \nwere becoming even more nuanced as they continued to evolve.  New products, new \ncircumstances and experiences continued to arise, and new discourses and information \ncontinued to come to hand which fitted in one way or another with various individuals\u2019 view of \nwhat naturalness consisted of.  Some of these changing aspects of the natural assemblage were \nhighlighted by the participants, and are discussed below.   \nThe evolving assemblage of the natural: traditional, exotic, novel, ethical   \nMany of the participants looked back to the past, referring to practices that had been used by \ntheir parents and grandparents when they spoke about their preference for natural products.  \nThey frequently drew on childhood memories, recalling simple home remedies that had been \nused at the time.  They gave accounts of family illnesses being treated successfully with a \nminimum of fuss.   There was a strong element of nostalgia in the way participants recalled \nthese traditional practices using products that were readily to hand: \nMy mother was a country girl, and my grandmother.  In those days they were isolated, I \nsuppose. There was always lemon honey for a sore throat, those sort of things.  Baking \nsoda for bites, vinegar for stings \u2026 (Frances) \nComments like this evoked an idyllic and comfortable past \u201c\u2026 as it should have been\u201d (Thomson, \n2008: 4-5), when simple remedies sourced from home kitchens sufficed to soothe all ailments.  \n61 \n \n \nBut as the epigram rather cleverly puts it, \u201cNostalgia is like grammar:  the present is tense but \nthe past is perfect\u201d (Lowenthal, 2015).9   \nCommon cultural narratives which draw on memories of a better, simpler past from which \nunpleasantness has been brushed away are a known phenomenon (Horton, 2008; Taylor, 2000). \nThe (re)construction of childhood as being a utopian time, a golden age that has been displaced \nby modernity, according to Soper (1988: 188) is not just a contemporary phenomenon but can \nbe found as far back as the beginning of recorded history.  Many of the participants\u2019 \nreminiscences drew on this sort of familiar narrative.  Interestingly, no matter whether their \nchildhood years were quite recent or many decades behind them, participants of all ages spoke \nof their childhood as a time when household remedies had been used at home for family \nillnesses and \u201cyou didn\u2019t just  pop down to the doctor for anything\u201d (Johnny).   They indicated \nthat they were simply continuing this tradition by being self-reliant and using the knowledge \nthat they had been brought up with.  They framed their practices learned from their earlier years \nas \u2018natural\u2019 but it was clear that, even if they did not recognise it, both the participants and their \n\u2018natural\u2019 practices had changed and evolved considerably over time.       \nTwo of the M\u0101ori participants illustrated precisely how their traditions had drawn from the past \nbut evolved over time, and for each of them in a different way.  Caro had grown up in a farming \nfamily where rongo\u0101 (M\u0101ori traditional healing) was in everyday use. She explained that her \ngrandmother was a skilled practitioner and her treatments worked \u201cfor us in the old days\u201d but \nsince then, attitudes and practices had changed:   \nIn my Nanny\u2019s days, there was always karakia [prayer], there was always a big process.  \nIt wasn\u2019t just about making rongo\u0101 and selling it and using it.  There was all this pre-\nstuff, you stuff.   \u2026  See, at the Matatini [the national festival of M\u0101ori culture], and I\u2019m \nnot bagging them, but they had a tent with people in there doing massage and things \nand they had things in bottles.  In my day, they didn\u2019t have that.  You became unwell, \nNanny went into the bush or wherever, got stuff, made stuff, and did the karakia, and did \nall the things before she applied or you took the stuff.  It wasn\u2019t about going somewhere \nand buying stuff and taking it.  That\u2019s where the difference is.  (Caro) \n                                                          \n9 Lowenthal (2015) cites this epigram and indicates in a footnote that this remark is of doubtful origin and \nis \u201cattributed to radio historian Owens Lee Pomeroy or speechwriter Robert Orben.\u201d  I have not been able \nto find any further source for this.  \n62 \n \n \nCaro was now a grandmother herself, and while she clearly regretted that the old ways were \ndisappearing, she acknowledged that the social context had changed and the practices could not \nremain static, but had to adapt.  The positive aspect, she went on to remark, was that interest in \ntraditional M\u0101ori medicine was growing and being opened up to a much wider range of people.  \nShe wished that she knew enough to \u201ceducate people correctly\u201d,  but noted that keeping strictly \nto the old traditions would not be an option for most people as the necessary natural substances \nwere hard to find in urban environments.  Another participant, Marama and her family, had a \ndifferent way of adapting the older ways they knew.  They had prioritised retaining one \ntraditional practice they considered important to carry out in the original way they had learned.  \nShe and her husband had first-hand knowledge from elders in their family for brewing infusions \nfrom the leaves of the kawakawa tree (Piper excelsum).  They went on family expeditions to rural \nareas to gather the leaves themselves, recited the traditional karakia (prayers) that had come \ndown to them from older generations, and kept special utensils for brewing and processing the \nleaves into a liquid.  In keeping with changing times, however, they kept the infusion in the \nfridge and mixed it with orange juice for their children to drink.   \nMany of the other participants who recounted home health care practices from their past could \nalso be seen to have adapted them as time passed and the context changed.  They might still fall \nback on old home remedies like lemon and honey drinks, but equally they had added new and \ndifferent options that were readily available.  Glucosamine and magnesium, for example, which \nare clearly not kitchen cupboard essentials, were the most frequently mentioned products in the \nstudy, with many participants taking one or the other (or both) regularly.  The evolution of \nhealth practices in just this way appears to be inevitable and is not necessarily something to be \nregretted. Moreover, it also happens in less developed countries where people\u2019s use of \ntraditional practices is common but changes over time and when new circumstances arise.  An \nexample reported in a study of traditional health practices in Tanzania (Bignante & Tecco, 2013) \nshowed that although some aspects of traditional medicines had been lost, people now had \naccess to a wider range of health care options:  herbal remedies and traditional healers, as well \nas doctors and allopathic medicines, all of which they found valuable.    \nSomewhat paradoxically, the interest in home-made traditional medicines has given rise also to \na surge of interest in the traditional medicines of distant societies that are made from \nsubstances little known to Western consumers (Connell, 2006; May, 1996).  This fascination has \nbeen attributed to a type of nostalgia, not for a personal past, but for a utopian \u2018ideal\u2019 and a way \nof getting in touch with a simpler and more natural way of life that has retained what has been \n63 \n \n \nlost by those living in contemporary Western society (Holbrook & Schindler, 2003; Pickering & \nKeightley, 2006).  While this is clearly an oversimplification of the complexities involved (see \nSnodgrass & Tiedje, 2008), part of the appeal of  unfamiliar substances seems to be in their \nexoticism, their \u2018otherness\u2019 and novelty \u201crather than any particular efficacy or medical merit\u201d \n(Bivins, 2007: 12).  There also appears to be an element of the mythologisation of indigenous \ncultures as exemplifying an authentic and uncorrupted way of living harmoniously with nature, a \nphenomenon that Davidov describes as: \nburgeoning worldwide, creating instances of performed culture through a web of \ncommodification connecting the indigenous producers, brokering their own culture with \nWestern consumers that come in search of their fantasies (2012: 482). \nTwo examples of these \u2018new\u2019 products sought by Western consumers are powdered maca root \n(Lepidium meyerii) from the Peruvian Andes (Gonzales 2012), and Garcinia cambogia (Nayak et \nal 2010), a fruit from Indonesia.  The medicinal uses of maca and garcinia have been well known \nfor centuries in their places of origin but have only recently entered the \u2018natural health\u2019 range in \nhealth stores and pharmacies.  Loyer and Knight (2018) in their case study of maca, show that \nthe discourses around this so-called \u2018Inca superfood\u2019 draw on an idealised framing of the people \nof the Andes as living in a nutritional utopia where plants are grown using traditional and \ntimeless methods, presenting it in contrast to the industrialisation of the developed countries \nwhere it has suddenly become popular. Certainly, products containing maca or garcinia were heavily \npromoted in the print publications that I collected during the course of this study, often with reference to \ntheir exotic origins.   \n So while the assemblage of the natural includes discourses of simplicity, homeliness, and \nmemories of the past, it may also evolve to encompass those products which are unfamiliar but \nseem appealing both because of their exoticism in the individual\u2019s particular context and the \nidea they convey of a more \u2018natural\u2019 way of life. Pickering et al (2006) have argued that nostalgia \nis not necessarily a regressive longing for the past, but can also accommodate progressive ideals \nfor change.   One participant, for example, spent much of the interview enthusiastically \ndescribing his recent discovery of a new and exotic product known as etherium gold, which, he \ntold me had originated with the pharaohs of ancient Egypt 2000 years ago, and which he was \nable to obtain online:    \n\u2026.this is a white powder a nano-particle white powder.  They found that throughout \nEgypt  \u2026  there\u2019s some temples in Syria that are Egyptian that have every pharaoh there \n64 \n \n \nand it\u2019s dedicated to gold and all they found inside was massive amounts of this white \npowder.   And this is what they put in the bread and the mana and everything else that \nthe pharaohs ate that let them contact the after-life. (Cliff) \nIt seemed as if its main appeal for him was in its novelty, exoticism and links to a distant mythical \npast rather than any particular naturalness.  But rather than nostalgia for his own, or an ancient \npast, he appeared to be using the novel substance as a means to progress and renew his life in \nwhich, he told me, he had at times become trapped in negative and damaging behaviour \npatterns which he regretted and had now put behind him.    \nSome participants, in contrast, were uncomfortable about the idea of exotic products, \ncommenting on their decided preference for products to which they felt a connection to their \nown environment:  \n I feel like our natural environment where we live affects us and what is grown in that \nenvironment I feel generally is what is good for the climate and the people that are living \nthere.  And when you start getting things from overseas and all over the place out of \nseason and what not, then sometimes you can disturb the balance that you have to you \nas a person living in the environment and right now. (Bryony) \nPeople with this kind of preference for the local product have been described elsewhere as \n\u2018ethnocentric\u2019 consumers (Batra et al., 2000; Haque & Maheshwari, 2015), that is, individuals \nwho relate their health and social practices to feelings about their own culture and \nenvironmental surroundings.   Olivia was another such individual; even more than Bryony, she \nvoiced active disapproval of exoticism and found it to be a form of cultural appropriation, an \nattempt to  \u2018buy\u2019 into traditions that had no place out of their own context:  \n I have a distaste for a lot of that \u2026 new ageism, stuff that goes into things that I don\u2019t \nunderstand why you would want to connect to something that is so foreign.  \u2026 On the \nother hand, if you are connecting to traditions that your ancestors have practised for \nthousands and thousands of years but have been displaced through colonisation or other \neffects of migration, for me, that\u2019s an entirely appropriate way back to source.  (Olivia) \nOlivia is not alone in viewing the \u2018exotic\u2019 in this way.  Davidov (2011:483), while primarily \ndiscussing eco-primitivism, has referred to the appeal of the exotic as a form of retro-\ncolonialism, where fragments of nature serve to connect the user to \u201cpost-colonial fantasies of \nan authentic pre-industrial harmonious fusion of nature and culture\u201d.   But this too is not as clear \n65 \n \n \ncut as it seems; what is \u2018natural\u2019 and what is \u2018exotic\u2019 evolves over time and space and is never \nstatic.  Many plants now perceived as being local and natural in New Zealand, are not natives, \nbut arrived with European colonisation in the 19th century.  Centuries before that, the kumara, a \nstaple of the pre-European diet for M\u0101ori, was in its turn brought to New Zealand from islands in \nthe Pacific and adapted for New Zealand growing conditions (Law, 1970; Yen, 1963). \nAdditionally, participants\u2019 interpretations of what was \u2018naturally\u2019 found locally tended to vary \ndepending on their own life trajectory.  Bryony quoted above, indicated that for her, it was \nplants that grew in her own garden and nearby, regardless of where they were originally from.  \nDevon, on the other hand, who had come to New Zealand quite recently as an adult, did not \nconsider the herbs she knew from her home country as being \u2018local\u2019 to her new surroundings: \nSo that is perhaps another unique thing here, that we use western medicine \u2013 or western \nherbs, which actually have to be  [imported] \u2013 well some of them grow here now \u2013 but \nthey are not natives here. (Devon) \nEven very recent \u2018exotics\u2019 that have come into favour as components in natural products, such as \nthe goji berry plant (Lycium barbarum), can now be bought from plant nurseries in New Zealand \nby the home gardener, demonstrating that being \u2018local\u2019 is a dynamic concept that resists being \nbounded to a physical place once it becomes established in another. Modern communications \nand population movements, globalisation and multiculturalism give rise to co-mingling and \nfusion of cultures that at the same time \u201cdilutes, enriches and alters individual cultures\u201d (Craig & \nDouglas, 2006: 323). So the assemblage of the \u2018local\u2019 and \u2018exotic\u2019 is made up of individual \nconnections, and is continually evolving, including, in the world of herbal medicines.   \nAnother evolving meaning of the \u2018natural\u2019 that came to light in the study was an implication that \nnatural products are environmentally sustainable and therefore an ethically responsible choice \n(Soper, 1998: 2; Todd, 2004).  A considerable number of the participants commented on their \npreference for the Kiwiherb\u00ae range of herbal medicines, where both the name and the use of \nNew Zealand native plant products indicate that it is literally, \u2018rooted\u2019 in the local environment:  \n\u2026we are developing a whole lot more natural based products within New Zealand \ncompared to way back then, which is interesting\u2026maybe it\u2019s the clean, green image that \nwe have.  \u2026  Maybe the greeny side of people in New Zealand who are conscious of the \ncarbon footprint as well, whether that comes into it  \u2026  accessibility, I think we are more \nlooking after our own in our own little space. (Lesley) \n66 \n \n \nHere Lesley is drawing on discourses that construct the New Zealand environment as a pristine \nland of natural landscapes symbolised by the international marketing promotion that has been \nused to advertise New Zealand tourism and agricultural products as  \u2018100 percent pure\u2019 \n(Desmarais, 2015; Patil, 2019). Though easily deconstructed to show that the New Zealand \nenvironment cannot live up to this impossible claim, the belief that New Zealand has a unique \nand largely unspoilt natural environment has tended to persist.  The use of New Zealand \nproducts in supplements resonated strongly with other \u2018ethnocentric\u2019 (Batra et al., 2000) \nparticipants who valued home-grown products that they found familiar and culturally congruent \nwith their own upbringing.  Lesley\u2019s comment about being conscious of the carbon footprint also \ntouches on the concept of reducing the environmental impact of bringing imported products in \nto New Zealand when they can be produced on site, and implicitly draws on concepts related to \nthe wider discourses around climate change and human behavior that affect the natural \nenvironment (Holden et al., 2014; Stephenson et al., 2013).     \nWhile the Kiwiherb\u00ae products appear to live up to their reputation of using (at least some) home \ngrown ingredients, labels that claim naturalness do not always live up to what they imply.  The \nphenomenon of \u2018borrowing\u2019 an aura of naturalness but without any grounds for doing so is \nknown as \u2018greenwashing\u2019 and is a way of promoting sales by linking to discourses of \nsustainability and naturalness that resonate with consumers.  \u2018Greenwashing\u2019 has been \ndescribed in the supplement field (Todd, 2004), as well as in the marketing of organic foods and \nfair trade products (Jaffee, 2010; Jaffee & Howard, 2010).  Moreover, even if products \nthemselves are genuinely naturally grown and produced, there may be other perverse effects if \na particular plant becomes the focus of a wave of global attention.  One participant raised this \nissue in relation to the surge of interest in honey and oils from m\u0101nuka [Leptospermum \nscoparium], a New Zealand native plant that grew prolifically in her home area:      \nAn American company had come in to the Hokianga [a rural area in the north of New \nZealand] and bought some land up there that had loads and loads of m\u0101nuka.  There \nwere acres of it full of m\u0101nuka \u2026.  it is going to America and they are putting it in \nplasters and bandages. \u2026 What that spoke to me was, why didn\u2019t M\u0101ori get on to this?  \nWhy are we leaving Americans to come and buy our land and we can\u2019t even buy it? Then \nthey speak of \u2013 we are going to bring work into the Hokianga, we\u2019re going to bring \nrevenue \u2013 of course it hasn\u2019t happened.  I think they are getting Norwegians and \nGermans, you know, tourists, student visas, to work, to do that, and not the locals. \n(Marama) \n67 \n \n \nNot only had the local population missed any benefit as Marama suggested, but the swift rise in \nglobal demand for m\u0101nuka products had been acutely negative.  The  so-called \u2018m\u0101nuka honey \nwars\u2019 had broken out; thefts, vandalism, violent beatings of competitors, outsiders coming into \nthe area, uplifting or sabotaging competitors\u2019 hives, poisoning the bees, and putting long-term \nbeekeepers who understood the sensitivity of the local ecology out of business (Neal, 2016; Roy, \n2016).  A different set of adverse consequences from the same popular demand for naturally \ngrown herbal products in Nepal was reported by Kunwar et al (2013).  Whereas local people had \nbeen able to gain an extra means of livelihood for their families by gathering and selling the \nplants (Larsen & Olsen, 2007; Olsen & Larsen, 2003), the lack of an overall strategic plan for \nsustainability had \u201cpushed many of Nepal\u2019s medicinal plants to the brink of extinction\u201d (Kunwar \net al., 2013:1).  So while both the m\u0101nuka products and the Nepalese medical plants were \ncertainly \u2018natural\u2019 by one reckoning, they resulted in environmentally and ethically questionable \nsituations.     \nThis kind of blending of the natural into the different, new, or \u2018other\u2019 also seemed to be linked to \na further phenomenon that I encountered on my pharmacy and health store visits.  Some of the \nproducts in the \u2018natural health\u2019 section were branded with names that made them seem more \nlike a chemical or pharmaceutical, rather than anything obviously \u2018natural\u2019.  Examples included \nCoQ10 (Co-enzyme Q10), Kyolic (a garlic extract), and curcumin (from turmeric), all of which are \nderived directly from natural substances. Kerry, a participant who worked in one of the stores I \nvisited showed me sample sachets of both Kyolic and CoQ10 that she gave out as a trial for \ncustomers who wanted something that might enable them to cut down or even substitute for \nsome of their prescribed medicines that they believed were giving them negative reactions:  \n\u2026there seems to be a little bit more sensitivity coming in to drugs.  I can\u2019t take that \nbecause it reacts with me so I take CoQ10 and Kyolic instead for my blood pressure, that \nsort of thing.  I\u2019m not sure whether that\u2019s because I am dealing with it more often or \nbecause that\u2019s a trend.  (Kerry) \nDeliberately branding products with a name that conveys neither what the product does, nor the \ncommon name for what it is, seems a puzzling strategy.    Several things may possibly be \nhappening here at once that make the seemingly counter-intuitive label work:  the name is both \nnovel and intriguing so that a certain mystique is generated for those who are attracted to \nsomething \u2018other\u2019.  Moreover, because it is shelved in the \u2018natural health\u2019 space and alongside \nproducts with functional names for similar conditions, those whose prime need is to stick with \n\u2018natural\u2019 products may be reassured, even though the name seems obscure at first sight. \n68 \n \n \nConversely, it may also be that the more \u2018medicinal\u2019 sounding name may reassure others new to \nor suspicious of \u2018alternatives\u2019.  \nDeconstructing the natural shows how it \u201copens things up for] the \u201cincoming of the other\u201d \n(Derrida, 1997: 77) and undermines the notion of a sharp dividing line between what is natural \nand what is not.  The participants\u2019 comments about what was natural were at once far more \nnuanced and also far more productive of change and development than the polarised \noppositions that see separately bounded categories between natural products and prescribed \nmedicines.   A spectrum of meanings of naturalness could be accommodated within the \nassemblage around supplements no matter where individual participants drew their own line \nbetween what they considered natural or not. The diverse products, public and private \ndiscourses, experiences and understandings of the participants and the unique connections that \neach person had made between them formed a complex network of actions and interactions \naround ideas of what was natural.  Past and present, novelty and tradition, exoticism and \nlocalness, environmental sustainability, all were tangled together and connected to naturalness \nin different ways.  Names of products could be highlighted as simple natural substances, or \npresented to appear more like a medicine.  Older ideas might fall out of favour and be discarded, \nor just as easily be reformulated or reimagined to suit changing times. The connections and \nrelationships between the many components could be arranged and rearranged according to the \ninterpretation of different individuals, in a constant state of immanence, connecting to \u201cthe \nsemantic and pragmatic contents of statements, to collective assemblages of enunciation, to a \nwhole micropolitics of the social field\u201d (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987: 6).  Together all these \nperspectives of the natural formed an intricate and complex rhizomatic assemblage that was \nconstantly in a state of becoming and changing.  \nWoven into the components of the natural was a further notion as yet only touched on; the idea \nthat natural products have integrity; they are pure, complete in themselves, whole and \nuntampered with by human interference.  As such they are often described as \u2018holistic\u2019 and the \nuse of them to be a part of an \u2018holistic\u2019 approach to health care.  The next section of the chapter \nexamines the various interpretations of this ubiquitous word that were manifested in the \ndiscussions with the participants.   \nHolism and holistic health    \nStudies examining the preferences of users of alternative products and therapies have \ncommonly accepted participants\u2019 assertions of the preference for \u2018holistic\u2019 health without \n69 \n \n \nfurther analysis or comment (Barrett et al., 2003; Doel & Segrott, 2003; Sointu, 2013; Vickers et \nal., 2006). Peters et al (2003: 121) for example, report without further comment, that the people \nthey talked to stated they wished \u201cto take a more holistic approach to treatment and health.\u201d \nSimilarly, Vickers et al. (2005: 5) found that participants in their study \u201cpreferred a more natural \nway of healing embedded in a holistic approach\u201d.  The underlying idea in all these attempts \nseems to be that holistic health care is everything that \u2018reductionist\u2019 health care is not (Bell et \nal., 2002; Plsek & Greenhalgh, 2001).  Participants, too, talked about holistic health as a desirable \napproach that went beyond biomedical care. Lesley, a health store owner, for example \ndescribed her approach to clients as: \n \u2026. putting the jigsaw puzzle together for them and then I can make a much better go at \nsupporting whatever system is down or supporting where they are coming from \u2013 a \nholistic approach, if you know what I mean. (Lesley) \nThe term holistic as it is used in general speech today, however, is itself an assemblage of ideas \nthat span almost any area of human endeavour.   While \u2018holistic\u2019 is frequently seen in relation to \nhealth and health care, it is also used as a descriptor for fields as diverse as computing (Soomro \net al., 2016), religion (Parmer & Rogers, 1997), organic farming (Hole et al., 2005), \nentrepreneurialism (Jensen, 2014), human resources management (Hecklau et al., 2016), the \norganisation of government services (Dawes et al., 2004) and many more.  Health practitioners \nwho describe themselves as holistic range from registered medical professionals in general \npractice on the one hand (RNZGP, Undated), to alternative therapists offering services such as \u201ca \nholistic pulsing journey to peace awareness and healing\u201d (Murray, Undated). It is no wonder \nthen there is a \u201cplurality of understandings of holism, [that] encapsulate a fluid spectrum of \nperspectives\u201d(Nissen, 2011: 80) covering scientific, sociological and metaphysical world views.  \nAs Kretchmar (2013: 23) notes succinctly, \u201cmuch traffics under the name of holism today\u201d.   \nThere are two vastly different philosophical approaches to holism.  The first of these, the cosmic \nor metaphysical view of holism, has its origins in the eastern religions of Hinduism, Taoism, and \nBuddhism (Cobb et al., 2012; Erickson, 2007; Shroff, 2011). Holism in this sense is the belief that \nall matter, whether human or non-human, is unified by a life force; the self is merely a small part \nof the collective which in turn is part of the wider cosmos (Joshanloo, 2014; Shroff, 2011). The \nabnegation of the self and its desires are viewed as the way to achieve inner peace and harmony \nrather than the individualism and autonomy which are more generally admired in Western \nsocieties (Ricard, 2011; Shamasundar, 2008). The same fundamental belief in a unifying life force \nthat permeates all matter is also shared by many indigenous cultures including Canadian First \n70 \n \n \nNations (Auger et al., 2016; Hunter et al., 2006), African and South American traditional healing \nsystems (Izquierdo, 2005; Truter, 2007).  Similarly, in the M\u0101ori world, the life force (mauri) \nexists in all things, binding people to the environment and to the whole cosmos (Mark & Lyons, \n2010; Roberts et al., 1995):   \nEverything is related \u2013 people (living and dead), land, sea, flora and fauna, and the \nspiritual world. Land, sea, wind, and other environmental elements \u2026.   A person\u2019s well-\nbeing [is] intimately linked to the wellbeing of all others, human or non-human \n(Waitangi Tribunal, 2011: 64).  \nIn the metaphysical view of holism, an individual is intimately connected with everything around \nthem and their health and wellbeing will be disrupted if their body, mind, and spirit are out of \nbalance within themselves, or within their wider family, society or natural environment.  \nThe other major approach to holism was first proposed by Smuts in his 1926 publication Holism \nand Evolution (Erickson, 2007; Freeman, 2005; Nissen, 2011).  Smuts\u2019 defined holism as a state \nwhere the body, mind, and spirit are in perfect balance within each individual.  If this state is \nachieved, the totality constitutes more than the sum of its parts.  It is a creative synthesis where \n\u201call parts reciprocally influence and determine each other...\u201d (Smuts 1926: 86 cited in Nissen \n2011:77).  Adherents to this view of holism dismiss the life-force, or metaphysical approach to \nholism as belonging to \u201cprimitive and closed belief systems\u201d (Baum, 1998). They prefer to \ndistance themselves from it, terming it \u2018vitalism\u2019, and describe it as superstitious, anti-scientific, \nand lacking in intellectual rigour (Nissen, 2011). Smuts himself described cosmic holism as \u201c\u2026a \nvague expression, already ruined by popular use and abuse\u201d (Smuts 1926: 86 cited in Nissen \n2011:77).   \nMuch contemporary writing, however, seems to subscribe to neither of the two theoretical \napproaches entirely but to draw from both in a range of widely different combinations.  Where \ndefinitions are attempted they seldom agree with one another; some incorporate metaphysical \nelements while others do not (Erickson, 2007; Goldstein et al., 1988; Hoffmann, 1988; McColl, \n1994; Shroff, 2011; Sointu, 2013).  One commentator, for example, states that holistic health \npromotes \u201cintegrative energy that pervades, unites and directs all human dimensions\u201d \n(Goddard, 1995: 810), while another (Shroff, 2011: 245) proposes that the term \u2018holistic health \ncare\u2019 can be used \u201cinterchangeably with alternative or complimentary [sic] medicine\u201d.  Orthodox \nmedical practices too draw very different meanings from the term.  A New Zealand \u2018integrative\u2019 \nmedical practice indicates it follows \u201can holistic philosophy\u2026addressing body, mind and spirit\u201d \n(Helios Health, Undated), but  the definition by the Royal New Zealand College of General \n71 \n \n \nPractitioners omits any reference to things spiritual, or even emotional.  Their definition, \ninstead, refers to the way health services are provided, contrasting specialist with generalist \ncare:      \nWhere hospital doctors often focus on just one part of your body, a GP looks at your \nwhole body, your background, and the environment you live in when diagnosing \nillnesses and prescribing treatments. This is known as holistic healthcare (RNZGP, \nUndated). \nMcEvoy and Duffy (2008: 413) attempt to pin down exactly what holism is and provide a detailed \nanalysis of what they term the \u201cnebulous and subjective\u201d concept of holism. However, the \nlengthy table of components they list appears to add further to the confusion and demonstrates \nthe futility of trying to provide a bounded definition.  Their efforts underline yet again Derrida\u2019s \ninsistence that any attempt to \u201ctotalize, to gather\u201d into a unified and bounded definition is \ndoomed to failure and will always run up against \u201cthe limit it had to encounter\u201d (Derrida 1997: \n13).  \nMy own ideas about holism and holistic health were just as ill-defined at the time of the \ninterviews and I accepted what the participants said without exploring further how they \nunderstood the concept of holism. It was only on analyzing the data that I realised how vague \nand undefined the participants\u2019 statements were when they mentioned holistic health, although \nclearly they all recognised it as something positive to aspire to.  None of them referred directly \nto either of the philosophical approaches to holism, and none reflected on the meaning of the \nterm as several had done when talking about what was natural.  Nevertheless, on closer \nexamination of the participants\u2019 comments, I was able to distinguish a number of underlying \nconcepts that provided some insights into the meanings that they associated with the aspiration \nfor an holistic approach to caring for their health.      \nBalance and uniqueness of the person \nForemost among the ideas participants expressed regarding holistic health were their various \ninterpretations of \u2018balance\u2019.  Balance (or harmony) is an important and uncontroversial concept \nin holism (McEvoy & Duffy, 2008; Shroff, 2011) and one which is common to both the cosmic \n\u2018life force\u2019 and the \u2018integrated individual\u2019 theoretical approaches.   \n72 \n \n \n I would say I am into holistic, without being over the top.  I\u2019m into the whole thing about \ndoing the best you can for your body, looking after yourself, everything in moderation \nkind of. (Frances) \nFrances here interprets the idea of balance as moderation and avoiding extremes. There is a \nsuggestion in her comment that she applies the idea of balance not only to her physical health \nbut to other areas of her life as well.  For Murray on the other hand, the idea of balance was \nabout the physical body alone and the use of supplements was to ensure he had what he \nbelieved to be the \u2018correct\u2019 mix of nutrients for good health:  \n\u2026the unpaired electrons attack unhealthy cells trying to balance themselves.  Well if, for \nwhatever reason, the body is slightly run down, the baddies can overwhelm the goodies \nand invade the body.  So if the body is healthy through having all the sufficient minerals, \nvitamins and amino acids, it can stay at that higher level of health and fitness. (Murray) \nWendy similarly focused on the body and the importance that she and her husband placed on \n\u201cgetting the balance right\u201d by adding various supplements to their diet in addition to the food \nthey ate.  Bryony\u2019s views, on the other hand, were more aligned with the concept of the body as \nan integrated whole; in her view, she said, any health care treatment should be designed to \naddress a person\u2019s \u201cunique way of disharmony\u201d and restore their \u201cwhole body balance\u201d.    \n \nOther participants, however, seemed to connect their idea of balance with cosmic holism.  In the \ndiscussion with Tracy, for example, she referred to being guided by the M\u0101ori model of health \nwhich uses the metaphor of a house with four pillars, all of which must be equally strong to keep \neverything in balance.  The four pillars encompass physical, mental, spiritual and family health \nand are all linked together, reaching beyond the individual to the extended community and the \nwider cosmos (Waitangi Tribunal, 2011: 64).   \n \n I don\u2019t know, whether because of being M\u0101ori or thinking differently that I look at it as \nmore holistic, it\u2019s every part of you.  So for example, really simply to put it, te whare tapa \nwha [the M\u0101ori model of health].  [If] you are not looking after one particular area \u2026you \ncan balance, but if there\u2019s any stress comes on, then you can lapse.  (Tracy) \nA second theme that came through strongly from the participants was when they spoke about \nusing supplements and other alternative health care modalities because they desired \u2018more \nholistic\u2019 health care.  Although the statement is vague, in essence there seemed to be several \n73 \n \n \nrelated aspects that were important to participants.  Holistic health for Trudy was about having \nunderlying beliefs that supported their whole persona and enabled them to enjoy living; it was \nnot necessarily about their physical state:    \nHow do you know what perfect health is?  I don\u2019t know.  What is it?  What does it look \nlike for people?  Perfect health might be you are able to walk?  That for some people \nmight be perfect health.  For other people it is never being sick.  I don\u2019t know, is it a \nworthwhile quest for people?  I don\u2019t know that it is.  I think there is a lot of time and \neffort wasted in not enjoying what you\u2019ve got currently \u2026  my family are all completely \ndifferent and they all have their own set of beliefs equally as valid as what mine are and \njust as soul nurturing in their own way.  So really, the holistic thing coming into it.  \n(Trudy) \nIt is interesting here that Trudy refers to the idea of the quest, indicating that it goes beyond \nhealth to the meaning that can be drawn from life even if physical health has limitations.  Sally \nalso saw holistic health as being beyond the biomedical approach.  She related how \ndisappointed and humiliated she felt at the attitude she had experienced from doctors in \nrelation to her longstanding pain.  She had been through many investigations and referrals \nwithout any explanation being found, yet her pain persisted.  Her account showed that she \nbelieved that the medical profession had come to find her tiresome because they were unable to \nfind any cause that fitted their disease model and had \u2018washed their hands\u2019 of her problem:  \n\u2026the doctors just don\u2019t want to know.  Put me into pain clinic.  All in the head in the end.  \nAnd that was the most awful thing. (Sally) \nSally\u2019s comment here suggests that she interpreted the referral to the pain clinic as a rejection \nby the medical people she had consulted; a message without precisely saying so, that she was \nimagining her pain and so they were unable to help her any more.  The referral was the catalyst, \nshe reported, for consulting an alternative therapist who treated her with kinesiology, massage \nand supplements and whom she found to be: \n \u2026the loveliest guy\u2026 a nice guy who is effective\u201d: \u2026 I mentioned it [the abdominal pain] \nto this guy and he tested me \u2013 I was lying down...and he massaged it and it has been \nabsolutely fine.  So I go to him when I need.  \u2026   Oh, I will tell you what it\u2019s called, the \niliocecal valve and it\u2019s either open or shut \u2026 and he has shut it or opened it. (Sally) \n74 \n \n \nSally\u2019s account seems to indicate that it was the empathy of the alternative practitioner and the \ntherapeutic touch of the massage  (Monroe, 2009) that finally relieved her longstanding \nproblem.  Other participants also spoke about massage, oils, and supplements that had been \nused or recommended by alternative therapists.  These tangible \u2018things appeared to be an \nimportant element of alternative approaches for Sally and for other participants and are \nexamined in detail in the following chapter.   \nSally\u2019s experiences also had an element of another aspect of holistic care that the participants \nspoke of; the desire to be treated as unique individuals rather than being categorised, referred \nbetween services, or boxed into standard treatments that took no account of their personal \nsituation and context:    \n\u2026each time we\u2019ve had medical contacts is seeing that GPs are just trying to throw statins \nat people or whatever the drug of choice is.  (Wendy) \nModels of primary health care in New Zealand are continually evolving, with many beginning to \nbranch out into health hubs with collaboration between various professionals offering services \nsuch as physiotherapy, massage, nutrition, counselling and social work consultations (Breton et \nal., 2017; Pullon et al., 2016). There is also more explicit acknowledgement in recent \ncommentary that doctors need to deal with people as individuals, yet the model of care they \nwork within is still one where \u201cthe evidence is steeped in averages\u201d (Lawson, 2019: 441). The \naspiration may be to provide \u2018person centred care\u2019 (Richards et al., 2015; Van Royen et al., 2010) \nbut it does not yet appear to have been translated into the type of doctor-patient encounters \nthat the study participants said they were looking for.  Moreover, in the publicly subsidised \nprimary care system in New Zealand, the time allowed for each appointment with a general \npractitioner is usually no more than 15 minutes (RNZCGP undated), well below the hour or more \nthat the participants who practiced as alternative therapists said they allocated for each client:    \nAt an initial consultation sometimes it is quite hard to fit into an hour and a half; longer \nthan that and it feels like it\u2019s getting too long for the client but the longer the better in \nterms of getting information.  (Catherine) \nThis last is an important point; as well as their own decisions about supplements, some \nparticipants had consulted alternative therapists of various kinds who had recommended \nvarious products to take (or avoid), and sometimes provided them directly to their clients as part \nof the treatment. However, rather than the supplements, it was the time that the therapists \nwere willing to spend to listen to them and understand their individual concerns in detail that \n75 \n \n \nappeared to be congruent with the participants\u2019 construction of what holistic health care should \nbe.  Invariably, the participants commented first on these interpersonal factors and the rapport \nthey felt with the therapists, only afterwards mentioning what help they found for their health \nconcerns. Holistic care was also consistently framed by participants as simply \u2018nicer\u2019 than \northodox care.  Olivia contrasted her experiences of the orthodox health system with her visits \nto alternative health providers:   \n Gosh people are nice in alternative health.  \u2026  They\u2019ve got a perspective that you are a \nwhole person so they are willing to engage with whatever your questions are \u2026 it\u2019s just a \nmuch nicer experience. \u2026 The [orthodox medical] system, you know, you go in feeling \nsick, to a place that deals with sick people, and you end up coming out feeling more sick \n\u2013 at least mentally \u2013 by the experience that you have had there. (Olivia) \nThe therapeutic effect of an empathetic practitioner who provides reassurance by listening to \ntheir client intently and taking their concerns seriously, thereby sparking a sense of relief and \ncorresponding improvement, is well documented (Feller & Cottone, 2003; Kaptchuk et al., 2008; \nKelley et al., 2009; Larson & Yao, 2005). It was clear that those participants who had developed a \nrapport with a particular practitioner found it to have a healing effect. \nThe desire for wholeness \nThe participants also appeared to transfer the positive associations of therapist-mediated \nholistic care to supplement products that were described as being an overall or \u2018all-in-one\u2019 way \nof looking after themselves.   Although supplement product labelling does not tend to draw on \nholism vocabulary directly (or at least I did not come across any during my study), the \nimplication that a product will cover all needs links to both philosophical approaches to holism, \nwhich both carry the idea of unity, whether in all things (metaphysical holism) or within the one \nindividual.  Many participants made special mention of products that they used because they \nwere a whole \u2018package\u2019 that would work on any need, even if the need could not be identified \nprecisely.  Frances was one of several who took a product labelled \u2018A to Zinc\u2019; it seemed that the \nall-encompassing \u2018A to Z\u2019 descriptor answered her need to deal with non-specific symptoms she \nwas experiencing but which she was unable to attribute to any particular cause:   \nWell, lately I seem to be losing a lot of hair and I noticed I\u2019ve got ridges in my nails \u2013 that \ncan be a zinc deficiency, so I went off the Biomag and put myself just on a general \nCentrum vitamin that\u2019s got a bit of zinc and everything in it.   (Frances) \n76 \n \n \nThe name seemed to reassure her that it would take care of whatever was causing her \nsymptoms, and set her mind at rest about whether she ought to be doing more to look after \nherself.  The same idea seemed to underpin the \u2018Manager\u2019 products. Like the A to Zinc, such \nproducts do not tend to make a feature of their naturalness but the (very) small print on the \ncontainer generally shows a range of vitamins, minerals and herbal ingredients.  They have \ndown-to-earth names describing their function and seem to suggest that the consumer can do \ntheir part by buying and taking the product, then relax because the product will take over and do \neverything they need:      \nI currently take a product, one called Cholesterol Manager and I basically probably \nhaven\u2019t stopped taking that for eight or nine years.  Another one called Glucose Manager \nbecause I am diabetic and the longer I can stay off, or keep the medications from the \ndoctor lower, the better.  Whether it\u2019s actually doing any good or not I\u2019ve got no idea.  It \ncertainly doesn\u2019t seem to be doing me any harm.  (Paul) \nPaul\u2019s lack of concern here suggests that he leaves everything up to his \u2018managers\u2019.  He describes \nbeing on them for a long time, and even though he claims he does not know whether they are \ndoing him any good, there is an implication in his comment that he is confident that the \nproducts are \u2018taking care\u2019 of his conditions for him.  \nOther supplements also draw from concepts implicit in holism by using generalised words for \ndesirable qualities such as balance, \u2018multi-zone\u2019 and \u2018all in one\u2019.  They appear to be a modern \nversion of the 19th and early 20th century health tonic, an all-encompassing general remedy that \nwas said to have an enlivening effect on the whole body (Hands, 2018).  Tonics were popular in \nthe past for a wide range of non-specific conditions such as \u2018weakness\u2019, \u2018nervous instability\u2019, \nnutritional deficiencies or to \u2018purify the blood\u2019 (Crellin, 2004: 65-66).  Patented tonics in \nadvertisements from old magazines and newspapers include items such as Dr William\u2019s Pink Pills \nfor Pale People (Brewis, 1982: 125) which were said to give \u201cpure blood and strong nerves\u201d to \n\u2018ladies\u2019 who took them.  Not so very long ago, orthodox medicine too, subscribed to the idea of a \ntonic, advising substances such as cod liver oil, malt, iron, alcohol, and even cocaine (Houston, \n1959; Musto, 1992; Nabarro, 1934). However, by the 1950s, tonics had fallen out of favour and \ncame to be seen as unsophisticated and unscientific compared to vitamins, antibiotics and other \nmodern drugs (Crellin, 2004). Today, the concept of the tonic appears to be undergoing a revival.  \nThe free magazines from the health food store chain that I collected during the study had \nproducts billed as \u201ca century old immune booster\u201d (Anonymous, 2017: 11) and many examples \n77 \n \n \nof \u2018detox\u2019 products which, like the tonics of the 19th century, were promoted as having an overall \neffect by purifying the blood or the liver (Anonymous, 2018a: 6).    \nYet another form of the all-encompassing \u2018holistic\u2019 product was raised by participants who used \nor sold the \u2018total nutrition\u2019 supplement packages available through network marketing \ncompanies.  Usually these were in a powdered \u2018shake\u2019 format to be mixed with milk or water, \nand as they were said to provide a complete range of nutritional needs, they could be used as \nmeal replacements.   Molly, who both used and sold these packages, was enthusiastic about \ntheir benefits.  She described them as being \u201clike a tonic. \u2026basically that just helps your system \nprocess things and all that sort of stuff\u201d.  Several participants gave me brochures about products \nwhich used similar language (energy, vitality etc) as those sold in health stores and pharmacies, \nbut also coined their own terms, \u2018neo-life plus\u2019 being one example.  Unlike the retail products, \nhowever, the contents on these packages were not specified.  Instead the products were \ndescribed in an accompanying pamphlet as:  \n\u2026 based in nature: backed by science \u2026  delivered in highly bio-efficient forms in \nexclusive clinically proven formulas that maximize nutrient absorption, utilisation and \nbenefits by using the most advanced scientific methods and proprietary processes \n(Anonymous, Undated).   \nThe idea of a tonic for \u2018everything\u2019 appears to have a particular power.   It may be that choosing \nnot to know what is in a product or how it works somehow invests the substance with a type of \nmystique which may be spoilt for the user if it were to be itemised into a list of active \ningredients and their percentages.  One herbal handbook I examined seemed to endorse this \nview, stating that herbal tonics are \u201c\u2026 gifts of Mother Earth to her children.  To ask how they \nwork, is to ask how life works\u201d (Hoffmann, 1988: 87-88). The implication here is that the process \nat work is beyond human understanding and there is no need to know more or try to investigate \nit.  It may be that the concept links back to memories of the substances in myths and fairy tales, \nas discussed in Chapter 2, that have such powerful effects.  While these views may seem \ncounter-intuitive in the modern age, several participants with widely differing world views \nindicated that they were not interested in how things they ingested worked.  Olivia, speaking \nabout the products she used, remarked simply that \u201cIt works; I don\u2019t need to know how it \nworks.\u201d  Molly, rather more pragmatically simply placed her faith in the expertise of the \ninternational product company she used, noting that \u201cThey [the company] do all the science so \nwe [the users/sellers] don\u2019t have to.\u201d   While she did not deny that science needed to be \n78 \n \n \ninvolved, she seemed to prefer not to know anything about the details and to simply take \nassurances on trust.   \nWorld views like these clearly clash with those who like to find out exactly what is in their \nproducts and understand the scientific basis behind them.  Moreover they give a ready platform \nto critics of alternative health care products to label the people who use them indiscriminately \nas being superstitious and anti-science (Ernst & Singh, 2008; Freeman, 2005: 155). A more \nmeasured view than these opposing dualisms, suggests that people who have faith in products \nlike tonics because they see them as holistic rather than directed solely at a biomedical result is \na result of a strong medical counterculture in the last several decades which has led to:   \n \u2026an increasing awareness of the limits to orthodox biomedicine in terms of safety and \nefficacy and a desire by consumers to gain greater control over their own health care \nand well-being \u2013 especially when orthodoxy had failed to produce results for them \nindividually (Saks, 2003: 144).       \nAs Saks points out, there are many more nuances across the spectrum of products and opinions \nabout supplements and alternative medicines that sit between the avid supporters on the one \nend and the vociferous critics on the other.  The issue cannot simply be dismissed as one \nbetween \u2018experts\u2019 on the one hand and misguided or ignorant members of the public on the \nother.  It is just as well documented that a degree of faith, rather than strong evidence, \nunderpins some of the most widely used drugs in orthodox medicine.  The mechanism of action \nof paracetamol (acetaminophen) is still regarded as not entirely certain (Bonnefont et al., 2003; \nGraham et al., 2013; Graham & Scott, 2005), and evidence about whether SSRIs (selective \nserotonin reuptake inhibitors) are effective for depression is said by a number of commentators \nto be weak (Ioannidis, 2008; Moncrieff & Kirsch, 2005).   \nWhile the comments of the participants about holistic approaches to health were framed in an \nentirely positive light, holism and the concept of holistic health does have its critics.   Both   \nmetaphysical holism and the integrated individual approaches to holism have been seen as \nmoralistic and to have a tendency to blame people who do not use illness or adversity as an \nopportunity for personal growth; they are expected to use their experiences to finding meaning \nin all aspects of life, including those which are unpleasant or painful (Erickson, 2007; Goldstein et \nal., 1988; Hoffmann, 1988; McColl, 1994). Because both approaches require the individual to \ntake responsibility for rising above their problems - putting aside their worldly desires \n(metaphysical holism) or reconciling their body, mind, and spirit \u2013 they have been criticised as \n79 \n \n \nignoring social determinants of health such as poverty and unemployment, over which \nindividuals have little control (Lowenberg & Davis, 1994; Madden, 2012; Marmot, 2005). \nCondemning the individual regardless of their circumstances if they \u2018fail\u2019 to achieve the desired \nlevel of integration or inner peace, according to this critique, as Madden (2012: 31) has \ncommented, may \u201cactually strengthen biomedical hegemony.\u201d   \nNone of the participants mentioned or even appeared to be aware of the negative views of \nholism and holistic health. The criticisms raised in the academic literature were simply absent \nfrom the discussion.   Moreover, participants\u2019 comments indicated that they were acutely aware \nof the problems faced by their own networks of family and friends and how these in turn were \noften driven by societal conditions.  They appeared to see this as an additional reason to seek \nwhat they interpreted as holistic care rather than being in conflict with it or burdening them \nwith more responsibility than they desired. As Caro pointed out, there are much wider \ncontributors to wellbeing than health care services alone:   \nSo you have to sweep the yard before you can see the floor sort of thing \u2026   all the other \nthings around that need to be good before you can get to the Type 2 diabetes \u2026 the \nperson with the diabetes is thinking about their mokopuna [grandchildren] not having \nany shoes or not being able to pay.  \u2026. when you are working in a M\u0101ori holistic, a \nkaupapa M\u0101ori organisation, you are looking at the whole picture, not just the Type 2 \ndiabetes. (Caro) \nMany of the participants made comments in a similar vein; it was a rare conversation that did \nnot touch on the influence of socio-economic circumstances and the wider environment on their \nown health and that of others.  Far from it being an oppressive duty, almost all participants \nindicated that being responsible for their health was something they aspired to, and wanted to \nbe actively involved in. Moreover, given that the terms holism and holistic health now have such \na fluid interpretation in common parlance, and are used with such frequency, these criticisms \nseem to have lost their relevance, except within academic theoretical discussion.  The idea of \nresponsibility is taken up again in Chapter 6.     \nThe two theories of holism have quite distinct beliefs and are markedly different from each \nother. It seems, however, that ideas about holism and holistic health have been adopted in a \nform that has become distanced from either of these defined theoretical origins and has taken \non a much more diffuse understanding.  The variety of ways that holistic health is interpreted \nappears to defy efforts at defining it (Goddard, 1995; McEvoy & Duffy, 2008) and to demonstrate \n80 \n \n \nprecisely what Derrida meant about the futility of attempting to pin things down into a fixed \nstate.  Deconstructing holistic health shows a range of diverse discourses being applied across a \nwide spectrum.  They have similarities around themes of connectedness, integration, balance, \nharmony, and wholeness. However, holistic health is also being stretched to accommodate \ncompeting nuances that range from the mysterious healing power of tonics to the statements of \nthe Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners about the way the health care services \nthey provide are organised.  With the term \u2018holistic\u2019 being applied to almost anything, it might \nseem that it has become no more than a feel-good buzzword\u2019 (Cornwall, 2007) in danger of \ndissolving into \u201cmultiplicity and disassociation\u201d (Derrida 1997: 13).  On the other hand, it may be \nthat its very ambiguity and vagueness (Davis, 2008: 69) allows the overall concept to evolve in \nnew ways that produce change and development.  Whatever the future, however, the important \npoint is that all the different discourses about holistic health were being discussed and were \ninterconnecting with the many other actants in the rhizomatic assemblage, changing and being \nchanged in a constant process of becoming.  \nQuite different from the vagueness of holistic health, however, were the very specific ideas \nabout risk that the participants held.  Every one of them had something to say about risk, had \nclearly thought about risk in some detail.    As Zinn (2008: 3) comments, \u201crisk looms large in \npresent day society\u201d, with new risks highlighted daily across a vast spectrum of scientific and \neveryday situations. Risk drives both societal and individual actions in responses that seek to \nmeasure it, contain it, eliminate it, or even in some circumstances, to embrace it.  The next \nsection outlines the way the participants viewed risk. \n Safety from risk: the body under siege  \nParticipants connected their supplement use directly with efforts to address the risks that they \nbelieved they might have been exposed to or were a continuing concern in the lives.  Jordan for \nexample, told me that:   \nTwenty five years ago I would have told you that supplementation was a complete waste \nof time.  That all you needed was a good diet.  Then someone challenged me to go and \ninvestigate what\u2019s actually in our food.  I now take up to 25 supplements a day.  (Jordan)  \nSafety and risk are two sides of the same coin as people seek certainty in an uncertain and \ninsecure world (Tierney, 1999; Walklate, 2004).  But risk tends to be by far the more dominant \ndiscourse (Derby & Keeney, 1981; Spencer & Triche, 1994; West, 2000). The predominance of \nrisk across so many aspects of life has led to what Lupton describes as \u201can apparatus of expert \n81 \n \n \nresearch, knowledge and advice [about risk] \u2026 in areas as far-ranging as medicine and public \nhealth, finance, the law, and business and industry\u201d (2013: 10).   There are two main approaches \nto investigating risk.  Realist perspectives use statistical methods to quantify the current and \nfuture likelihood and magnitude of events or dangers occurring and model what actions can be \ntaken to reduce such risks.  In health care, for example, they may measure a person\u2019s risk of \nheart disease or diabetes, and to what extent the risk might reduce if certain interventions are \nmade (Agborsangaya et al., 2013; Finegold et al., 2013).  Constructionist approaches, on the \nother hand, examine the different contexts in which risks come to be understood (Lupton, 2013; \nZinn, 2008), seeing risk as always being mediated through social and cultural views and \nexperiences.  Some constructionist approaches propose that the emphasis placed on risk is a \ngeneral social response to the uncertainty of modern times and a growing distrust by the public \nin the capability of science and technology to address the problems that they have created or \nrecognise new ones that emerge. The concept of an overall social response is fundamental to \nthe idea of modernity as a \u201crisk society\u201d (Beck, 1992, 2000; Giddens, 1990). A more \nindividualised and nuanced approach to risk was taken by Lupton (1999) and Tulloch and Lupton \n(2003), who demonstrated that rather than being generalised as an overall public response, risk \nperceptions are strongly shaped by individual factors such as cultural background, gender, and \nnationality. Moreover, that responses to risk change over time as a person moves through life, \ndepending on their experiences, their social standing, their access to resources, and the people \nthey come into contact with.  The participants\u2019 comments on risk were consistent with this latter \napproach.  Most of them drew on current social discourses about risk, and some of them also \ncited statistics that drew on realist understandings, but it was clear that they saw risk as \npersonal and contextual to their own lives.   They might couch their initial comments in general \nterms, for example, speaking about the risk that environmental contamination posed to health, \nbut then go on to explain in more detail the personal or family health problems which they \nbelieved had come about because of the risks they had experienced and actions they had taken.  \nTheir reactions to risk were selective and individualised, illustrating Zinn\u2019s comment that the way \npeople handle risk is as much about \u201cdifferent values and lifestyles, power relations and \nemotions\u201d (Zinn 2008: 4) as it is about any \u2018reality\u2019 of risk.    \nWhile the risks that the participants raised were mostly related to personal health, they also \nranged more widely, particularly into adjacent issues of food safety and quality, environmental \ncontamination, and potential risks to global security.   Each person had a different story to \nrecount as to how they had arrived at their particular position where health risk intersected with \n82 \n \n \nsupplements, but common to them all was the idea that the positive \u2018naturalness\u2019 of \nsupplements was one avenue that could be mobilised to offset the negative health risks that \nconcerned them. Bernie described occupational exposures that had influenced his present \nviews:    \n\u2026 ten years working in very chemically intensive environments and huge amount of \nstress as well.  There were lots of tests, some of those were sent over to America, and \nsome of those came back as quite chronic deficiencies in quite a few areas.  So nothing \nelse had actually worked medically, so we were using nutritional supplements to get me \nback on my feet again.  (Bernie) \nAs a result of his experiences, Bernie had undergone a series of training courses to become \nknowledgeable about supplements and was now an owner-operator of a health food store with \nseveral staff.   As well, he grew his own vegetables and ensured that any other produce he \nconsumed was \u2018spray-free\u2019 so that he reduced exposure to any pesticide residues.  \nImportantly, the risks participants talked about were not just those they knew were definite, and \nthose which they suspected were possible or likely, but they also had an awareness that there \nmay be other unknown risks \u2018out there\u2019 which they as yet could not even imagine.   As Daase \nand Kessler (2007: 411) have described, the spectrum of risk encompasses everything from the \nimmediate and specific to those which are entirely unsuspected:        \nWe might have reliable methods of identifying observable facts, thus producing known \nknowns.  But we might also have some methods of dealing with phenomena that we are \nnot 100% sure of, thus creating known unknowns.  On the other hand, we must accept \nthat there might be things we do not even dream of and have no method of anticipating; \nthese are the unknown unknowns.  \nThis excerpt comes from the apparently unrelated sphere of global terrorism, but it exactly \nparallels the categories of risk that the participants raised.  These included health problems they \nalready had and feared could worsen; those they did not yet have but felt they might be at risk \nof developing; and those that may well exist \u2018out there\u2019 somewhere, even though as yet they \nwere unknown and unsuspected.  They also differentiated between external risks that might \ninvade them from outside the body, and those that they might be carrying already within \nthemselves and which were lurking there ready to make themselves evident.   Using \nsupplements was a defence strategy that could be mobilised in all these categories.     \n83 \n \n \nRepelling external invaders  \nThe most obvious of the risks that participants spoke about were the viruses and temporary \nailments that might invade the body and take hold at an inconvenient time.  Participants used \nsupplements to try and ward off risks that seemed imminent, in the hope that they would be \nable to keep on with their work commitments, continue to run a business or take care of their \nfamily\u2019s needs:      \nAll the staff were sick, coughing over me, and I started having a sore throat.  I thought, oh \nno, \u2026 I cannot get sick if I\u2019m going off on a trip like that so I took the prescribed dose of \nthis particular Echinacea product and OK, maybe my body got on top of it or what but I \nwent on the trip, was fine, came back to find that I had no more symptoms or anything \nand they were still sick when I came back.  (Lou) \nFortifying themselves with supplements was an easily mobilised strategy that people could \nemploy as an attempt to protect against illness, which at best would be an interruption to usual \nactivities or at worst, cause financial hardship.   \nRather than the familiar hazard of being laid low by a virus, it was the risk of exposure to \nenvironmental contamination through air, soil, and water that the participants raised more \nfrequently as a concern.  Several spoke heatedly about the lack of control that individual \nmembers of the public like themselves had over these dangerous substances that were \neverywhere and were constantly threatening to invade their bodies and make them ill:       \n\u2026.  we have 27,000 chemicals left over from the Vietnam war, only five of which have \nbeen tested in singularity for safety and these are being used now in the agricultural \nindustries.  We\u2019ve got the timber industry; we\u2019ve got the dairy industry and other \nindustries, all these toxins that we\u2019ve been exposed to, many of which have in some ways \nunknown effects on our DNA especially when they are given in combinations.  \u2026  I believe \nthe reason that a lot of chronic diseases are on the increase is because of chromosomal \nmutations, and I believe that\u2018s why things like cancers are rife, and diabetes and all these \nother things.  (Jordan) \nJordan suggests that these invaders may be operating at an insidious and unknown level, \nattacking the very building blocks of the body, its DNA.  Bernie, too, was also concerned about \nbeing exposed to environmental contamination.  He also had statistics at hand, telling me \u201cthere \nare nine new chemicals released every day untested and there are huge amounts of chemicals in \n84 \n \n \nour food.\u201d  Noticeably, they both draw attention to the lack of testing, implying that harm to \nhealth is already happening and yet there is a cavalier disregard on the part of the unnamed \nauthorities they consider responsible.   The concerns Jordan and Bernie express are not unusual; \nthey align with wider societal concerns about environmental contamination causing health risks  \n(Werner, 2014) as well as the level of uncertainty as to how these hazards can be managed \n(Campbell-Lendrum et al., 2015; Costello et al., 2009; Springmann et al., 2016)  \nBernie and Jordan\u2019s comments drew on realist ideas of risk, citing statistics and indicating that \nthey believed the risks ought to be better quantified and controlled by those in authority.  Yet \nwhile their statements were put forward as resulting from their cognitive reasoning, both Bernie \nand Jordan also described personal health problems which they attributed to environmental \nexposures, and which had clearly influenced their views.  Moreover, they indicated that they \nwere making their own assessment about risk without waiting for any official announcement.  \nThey both went on to speak of the strategies they used, including taking supplements, to \nrespond to the risks they believed were important. This reaction is what Beck (1992) termed  \n\u2018reflexive modernisation\u2019, that is where individuals feel they cannot trust science or \ngovernments and are left to their own devices to decide what is risky and what is not and then \ntake action accordingly.  \nAs well as concerns about contamination from chemicals in the environment, many participants \nalso worried about substances that were deliberately added to foods during processing:  \n...it is almost like we are getting attacked through the foods we eat and the chemicals we \ntake [in]. \u2026   To me, the best way is to get everything as foods and eat well but with \neverything being processed so much now \u2026.there is sort of a lot of stuff to say that food, \nprocessed foods, all these chemicals, all these numbers \u2026 and that\u2019s not good. (Cliff)   \nThe \u2018numbers\u2019 Cliff refers to are the E-codes used by the International Numbering System for \nidentifying Food Additives (World Health Organisation & Food and Agricultural Organisation, \n2019). The list of synthetic and natural additives is itself a diverse and moving assemblage; new \nsubstances are added and deleted over time, and each country has their own regulatory regime \nwhich stipulates which ones are allowable in foods manufactured and consumed there  (Carocho \net al., 2014). These additives were a welcome advance in health and food safety when they were \nfirst introduced in the early 20th century and enforced by regulations to prevent spoilage of food \n(Carocho et al., 2014; Doyle & Glass, 2010; Holzapfel et al., 1995; Shahidi & Zhong, 2010).  Today, \nhowever, when food safety tends to be taken for granted, additives and preservatives have \n85 \n \n \nbecome unnatural \u2018undesirables\u2019, viewed with suspicion and mistrust by an increasing number of \nconsumers (Cox et al., 2004) whether or not they are officially approved as safe (Carocho et al., \n2014; Devcich et al., 2007). Indeed caution about additives is growing in scientific writing as well, \nas a recent study of the association between \u2018ultraprocessed\u2019 foods and mortality shows \n(Schnabel et al., 2019).  \nAlong with environmental contaminants and food additives, prescribed medicines were \nconstructed by some participants as a separate category of dangerous external invaders.   None \nof them were opposed to pharmaceuticals in principle, but many had become wary about taking \nprescription medicines because of previous negative experiences. Several suggested that doctors \nwere too ready to prescribe drugs without cautioning them about possible harm of long term \nuse or following up to check how they were reacting:  \n\u2026 it was the pharmaceuticals, sadly, that got my children into trouble.  My eldest son \nwent on to a product called Roaccutane. \u2026 And he developed depression. And kids that \nhave a face that looks like a pizza, actually tend to get depression, and Roaccutane can \nactually push them over the edge with suicidal tendencies.  And that\u2019s what it did.  I \ndidn\u2019t lose him but I came close a few times and he was never monitored properly.  \n(Lesley) \nMoreover, some had found that if they raised their concerns with their doctor, they might \nsimply be offered more of the same medicines or different ones rather than be given any \nsuggestions for non-pharmaceutical treatments. Trudy reported that a family member had been \nprescribed \u201cstronger and stronger pain medication \u2026 to the point where he couldn\u2019t function.  \nIt\u2019s not safe\u201d.  Another participant found the tendency to simply escalate the dose of medication \nif it did not seem to be working was concerning, particularly in the light of her own experiences; \nshe had become dependent on pain medication after a sports injury:    \n\u2026  my GP would just write me out some more prescriptions if I needed it and I was just - \nno I don\u2019t want it, I\u2019m coming off it.  \u2026 The specialist offered to give me anti-depressant \npills which would help relax my nerves and help me sleep.  But he said oh, they\u2019re really \nterrible and lots of people have lots of issues with this one but we won\u2019t really know until \nyou try it.  (Tracy) \nShe went on to relate how she realised that her doctors either could not, or were not interested, \nin helping her overcome her dependence and she would have to take the initiative herself and \nuse strategies outside of formal medicine.  With the help of a pharmacist who suggested \n86 \n \n \ngradually reducing her dose and adding a natural sleep remedy she reported she was able to \ngradually wean herself off the prescription drugs and cope with the withdrawal symptoms, but it \nhad left her disillusioned with medical experts and sceptical about all prescribed drugs, \nparticularly if they were taken over a long period.     \nOther participants with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular or joint problems \nwere also uneasy about some of the medications that they depended on.  Several of them \nmentioned that, knowing the side effects of the drug they took, they were anxious to maintain \ntheir dose at the lowest possible level and supplements were a strategy that they believed could \nhelp do this:      \nI take vitamin B12 because of the metformin that is used to treat diabetes.  \u2026.  Doing the \nresearch on the \u2018net about that I discovered that metformin was one of the reasons you \nhave low B12 levels \u2026  I just brought it up on the smartphone and was reading through it \nand discovered the link to metformin and I thought gee \u2026 (Paul)  \nParticipants such as Tracy and Paul found it disturbing that they had not been given any \nwarnings about possible negative effects of the drugs they were prescribed and were taking long \nterm.  They indicated that they felt let down by what they perceived as the lack of care on the \npart of health professionals they had trusted to have their best interests at heart.  If they had \nknown, they suggested, they would have been alert to the risk from the start and would have \ntaken steps themselves to counter it.  Situations like these create a lack of trust in those who \nhave experienced them.  Some commentators have blamed the popular media for the distrust of \nhealth risk experts; they maintain that the media has over-emphasised unusual and exotic health \nrisks and downplayed those that are more mundane, such as poor diet and smoking, to the point \nthat it has \u201c\u2026undermined [the general public\u2019s] view of their own health, [and] increased their \nworries about environmental causes of poor health and fostered a migration to complementary \nmedicine\u201d (Petrie & Wessely, 2002: 690). Lupton however, takes the opposite view, finding that \nbeing sceptical of official advice and making up one\u2019s own mind about what is risky and what is \nnot, is a \u201chighly rational response to the failure of technico-scientific rationality in late \nmodernity\u201d (Lupton, 1999: 68).   The participants appeared to be thinking along the same lines \nand acting accordingly, particularly when their lack of trust was grounded in personal \nexperience.   As well as the fears about external substances that they might be ingesting or \ninhaling, many of them also raised concerns about being invaded stealthily from within by \nprocesses that were already going on in their bodies.  Supplements, it seemed, could also be \n87 \n \n \nmobilised as a protection against these internal risks, which might be lurking passively waiting \ntheir time to become active and damage their health and wellbeing.    \nThe quiet invader within   \nEven if individuals are leading exemplary lives, and following all the recommended advice about \ntaking care of their health there is always the possibility that they may suddenly find themselves \n\u2018at risk\u2019 of an unexpected disease or condition. There is no doubt that the \u2018body at risk\u2019 is a \nconstant theme in both the general and academic media. Popular publications tend to grasp new \nstudies of risk and highlight the most alarming points out of context, particularly if they are \nlinked to dreaded conditions like cancer or dementia (Behuniak, 2011; McDonald et al., 2016). \nMedical systems too tend to give the impression that everyone is at risk, highlighting one risk \nafter another followed by a constant stream of advice and warnings to individuals about how \nthey should conduct themselves in the face of these risks (Crawford, 2004). People who are \notherwise perfectly well are routinely assessed for cardiovascular risk, checked for diabetes, and \nurged to participate in cancer screening programmes (Ali et al., 2015; Canadian Task Force on \nPreventive Health Care, 2012; Goff et al., 2014; Wardle et al., 2016; Weng et al., 2017).  \nAdditionally, technical advances in DNA analysis that have resulted from the human genome \nproject, and the popularity of low-cost direct-to-consumer genetic testing has greatly increased \nthe genetic conditions that can be identified far ahead of any symptom development (Manolio \net al., 2019; Peterson et al., 2019). Members of the public can send samples of their saliva for \ntesting and may find out they have a genetic makeup which is a risk factor for conditions which \nmay never develop, or diseases which the individuals concerned may never have heard of \n(Armstrong et al., 2003; Gollust et al., 2003; Heshka et al., 2008; Hogarth et al., 2008; Ransohoff \n& Khoury, 2010). While these advances have been advantageous in some respects (Wise et al., \n2019), they have also exacerbated anxiety about risks that would never have previously been \nanticipated (Oliveri et al., 2016). As Lupton (2013) has pointed out, the widespread focus on risk \nrather than making people feel safer may increase their anxiety through highlighting it as \nsomething to which they need to direct their attention.  It is well documented, for example, that \ncancer screening programmes generate anxiety in some individuals, simply by inviting them in to \nbe checked even leaving aside the inexactitude of some of the measures used (Byrne et al., \n2008; Consedine et al., 2004; Yeh et al., 2015).    \nA number of participants with arthritis or residual discomfort from sports injuries worried about \ntheir conditioning worsening to the point where it would prevent them doing their usual \nactivities. Their fears were not about the present but of chronic illness and disability lurking in \n88 \n \n \nthe body and which could flare up and hit them with permanent \u2018biographical disruption\u2019 (Bury, \n1982; Morden et al., 2017; Williams, 2000).  They had turned to supplements to try to defer the \nanticipated deterioration in their health as long as they could.  Murray explained what it meant \nto him to have found supplements that helped:      \neverything\u2026my mobility, independence, not relying on anyone for help  \u2026 the \nprocosamine \u2013 the glucosamine sulphate \u2013 helps  joint health and build \u2026cartilage \u2026 [I \nhave] full mobility  \u2026  and without it my hip wouldn\u2019t have done, wouldn\u2019t have lasted. \n(Murray) \nOthers had no problems as yet but worried about the unknown future if they did not take \npreventive measures now, based on the history of older family members.  Johnny\u2019s experience \nof his mother\u2019s poor health at a relatively young age and her distress at being dependent and in \npain had made him fear what could be ahead for himself.  He said it had been a strong incentive \nfor him to resolve to stop smoking, and generally lead a healthier life in the expectation that he \ncould avoid having his quality of life eroded in the same way:  \nSeeing what my mother is like, I don\u2019t want to actually be like that myself.  You know, she \nfeels like she is a burden on people.  \u2026 Mum, she\u2019s overweight so she finds it harder to \nexercise and then with her heart problem the way it was, she couldn\u2019t actually get up \nand walk anywhere.  \u2026  She has to have a knee replacement but she doesn\u2019t get the knee \nreplacement until she loses some weight \u2026. (Johnny) \nHe had not smoked for many years now, exercised more, and was taking \u201call the vitamins and \nminerals and things\u201d as well as using different alternative therapies to do his best to stay fit and \nhealthy.   \nA further category of unknown risk raised by participants was the concept of \u2018subtractives\u2019 \n(Rozin et al., 2009), that is, concern about nutrients that were missing from their ordinary foods.  \nSo rather than worrying about chemicals or additives in food that could harm them, their \nconcerns related to what was assumed to be in food but was not:  \n\u2026  the amino acids which are not in our proteins anymore because they put on farms \u2013 \nsuper phosphates that kills \u2026   microbes, there\u2019s no worms on the farms; the minerals \ncan\u2019t get into the plants; there\u2019s no vitamins in the plants.  They sit up; the grass looks \ngreen but there is no nutrition in it.  Therefore the animals are eating that and everything \nis on the back foot.  (Clara) \n89 \n \n \nThe food might look fresh and wholesome, but Clara and several other participants spoke of \ntheir concerns about the possibility that the food they consumed was deficient in nutrients and \nthat their health was therefore being gradually undermined.  Murray, similarly, raised a point \nabout the properties of plants that had been manipulated for commercial reasons, further \nreducing their nutrient value.  He said he believed that something was wrong with modern \ncultivation methods though was uncertain of the exact details:     \n\u2026we are not getting the minerals and vitamins from our foods that we used to, because \nwheat is stripped of twenty two and then replaced with six or whatever \u2026.   (Murray) \nPat, who had worked in a bakery also talked about the reduction in the quality and nutrient \nvalue of bread during his time there because of new methods that were brought in to speed up \nthe process and avoid the long hours needed for \u2018natural\u2019 rising of the dough. This had resulted \nin \u201cthis crap bread that you get in the supermarkets.  It\u2019s not good for us\u201d. \nThe concern about harm from what has been taken out of food is less often voiced than that \nrelating to what has been added.  Rozin et al (2009) found that only a tiny minority of the more \nthan 1000 comments they collected from the public about naturalness in foods mentioned what \nhe termed  \u2018subtractives\u2019, while almost two thirds mentioned additives.  The participants in my  \n(much smaller) study, however, highlighted the issue of foods that lacked nutrients a number of \ntimes, suggesting perhaps that there may have been a growing concern about what is lacking in \nfood in the decade that has passed since the Rozin study was published.  What has not changed \nis that, in common with the findings by Rozin et al (2009), turning to supplements, a positive \nform of \u2018additive\u2019 was a strategy to overcome the unknown shortfall and allay their concerns.  \nAlmost all participants were also worried about the unknown risk of stress on their health.  \nAlthough stress can have positive as well as negative connotations (Baum, 1990; Bernstein, \n1996; Lazarus, 1993; Selye, 1973; Skjong, 2005), the participants tended to see it only in a \nnegative light. The issue of stress was particularly salient at the time the participants were \ninterviewed, as it was only a few years after a series of major earthquakes in Christchurch, when \nmany of them had lost their homes or had them seriously damaged.  Some were still fighting to \nget insurance payouts for their homes and/or business and were uncertain about their future \nhousing and financial position. Even those who had not been materially affected were still \nsuffering from a degree of anxiety and uncertainty that the long running series of earthquakes \nhad provoked. While their comments indicated that they attributed the cause of stress to \nexternal events and circumstances, they interpreted the effect of stress as being an eroding \n90 \n \n \nforce from within and one which could have unknown, but potentially far-reaching effects on \ntheir health.   \n\u2026one of the biggest influences on health is stress because I feel like it has a huge impact \non your ability to stay healthy and happy in the world.  (Bryony) \nThe natural characteristics of supplements were viewed as a positive buffer against stress and a \nsafeguard against the long-term, quiet undermining of their health without resorting to \nantidepressants or sleeping tablets, and, as Vonnie remarked, a far better option than \u201cusing \nmore crutches \u2026.alcohol, also drugs, smoking\u201d.   \nThe most acute expression of unknown risk, however, came from one participant whose \npessimistic view of the future had been a trigger for a radical revision of her family\u2019s lifestyle to \ninclude natural products, supplements and self-sufficiency strategies:   \n I was into the essential oils  - essential oils and natural stress [relief] coming here after \nthe earthquakes \u2026 I think if anything major happens in the world we are going to have to \ngo back to natural stuff.  That was one of the reasons we had started back then, us \nbelieving in a doomed world \u2013 you know, if there was fighting in certain areas then you \nare not going to be able to access it.  So then what are you going to do?  What are you \ngoing to be able to use?  So we have started \u2013 we are not great at it \u2013 but we have \nstarted growing vegetables, trying to do a few more things. (Wendy) \nWendy here draws on the link between the \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 that are part of the risk \nassemblage and links them with the assemblage of the natural to frame her view of the future \nand the strategy that she and her family were evolving to cope with it. She did not raise climate \nchange but her comments about a \u2018doomed world\u2019 do appear to be connected to the same \ndiscourses of the perilous future regarding global planetary health (Hansen et al., 2013; Kendall \net al., 2018; Sundstr\u00f6m et al., 2014). Her ideas were unusual among the participants at the time, \nbut in the few years since we spoke, they have become part of general discourse.    \nIn contrast, the one risk that appeared to be almost entirely disregarded by all by participants \nwas any notion that they might be at risk from taking self-prescribed supplements and herbal \nmedicines.  They saw them as an avenue whereby they could \u201cdo something safely for myself\u201d \n(Charles).  Their lack of concern about taking products they chose for themselves was in sharp \ncontrast to their concerns about prescribed medicines. It was also in direct contrast to the \nvolume of medical literature which frames supplements as risky, and consumers as vulnerable \n91 \n \n \nand in need of protecting from taking products without professional supervision (Geyer et al., \n2008; Lewis, 2019; Stickel et al., 2009; Tsai et al., 2012). Many participants indicated that they \nwere well aware of this disapproval by the medical profession but did not consider it relevant to \ntheir decisions about supplements.  Most would, however, usually avoid discussing their \nsupplement use with their doctor to avoid any conflict.  The juxtaposition of these opposite \npoints of view is taken up again in Chapter 6.   \nThose who sold supplements, on the other hand, appeared to be keenly aware of the discourse \nof risk from self-prescribed supplements that emanated from health professionals.  Although I \nwas not the one to raise the issue in the interview, almost all of them appeared to be positioning \nthemselves in relation to the criticism that they attract for selling such products to members of \nthe general public.  They all outlined in detail the steps they took to ensure the safety of their \nproducts and advice. They spoke about the attention they paid to ensure that they stocked good \nquality products that were accurately labelled and complied with regulations.  They reported \nthat they questioned their customers carefully about any prescribed medicines they took so that \nthey could check for potentially dangerous interactions. They drew attention to the importance \nof being confident themselves in their products and maintaining their reputation for providing \nprofessional and reliable advice which did not put their customers \u2018at risk\u2019. As Kerry noted,  \nAll the brands that we have got down there [in the shop] are good brands.  I would feel \nreally safe recommending any of them.  (Kerry) \n One of them also pointed out that the product manufacturers, too, had their reputation at stake \nand would lose a great deal if their merchandise was found to be contaminated or of poor \nquality:  \nAnd all the providers through the [name of health store chain] are randomly audited and \nregularly tested through the Ministry of Health as well and they know\u2026 if there was \nanything in those products \u2013 it would just wreck their multi-million dollar business \novernight.  They are extremely careful to be clean. (Bernie) \nAt the time of the interviews there had been a flurry of news in the popular media based on a \nrecent study of fish oils that were on sale locally (Albert et al., 2015). The reports described fish \noil as being more like  \u2018snake oil\u2019, noting that it was often oxidised, in which state if could be \nharmful to those taking it.  One of the pharmacists commented on this controversy:  \n92 \n \n \n\u2026from what I saw and what I heard was that it was a storm in a teacup; it was a \nmisinformed article and it wasn\u2019t actually relevant to what we use in New Zealand.  \nPrimarily it came back to storage conditions.  You will get an article that will be quite \ninflammatory \u2013 everyone that is for it [for example, fish oil] says \u2018pile of rubbish\u2019 and \neveryone against it and doesn\u2019t believe it in the first place says \u2018Oh, I thought so, I had \nmy suspicions, I knew all along\u2019.  (Jo) \nSubsequent stories about fish oil across various popular websites over the next couple of years \ncycled back and forth through positive and then negative framings and back again.  Fish oil was \npresented in some items as preventing diabetes, helping heart health and being beneficial for \npregnant women. Other headlines pronounced that fish oil products often lacked the ingredients \nthey claimed, were ineffective, a waste of money, or potentially harmful if they had been stored \ntoo long.  It is well documented that popular and social media tend to provide this kind of \ncontradictory advice on health issues to readers with eye-catching headlines (Ramachandran et \nal., 2018).  The end result of this kind of reporting, as Jo noted, is that people tend to dismiss \nthose that do not coincide with their own views and interpret those they agree with as an \nendorsement for what they practice.10   \nThe participants\u2019 approach to risk was different again from the way they talked about either \nnaturalness or holistic health. Whereas naturalness was shown to be much richer and more \nnuanced than the straightforward meaning many participants assumed, and holism was revealed \nto be evolving towards meaning almost anything, it was the detailed discussions and \nexplanations that participants put forward about the risks that concerned them that stood out.    \nThe shifting nature of risk is well recognised in modern everyday life because of the focus of \nattention that it receives from the media, the orthodox health system, and many other fields.   It \nwas interesting that none of the participants contested the idea that they were \u2018at risk\u2019 or found \nrisks to be over-stated.  On the contrary, most seemed to accept that there were known and \nunknown risks everywhere that could affect them and it was up to them to take action to \ncounteract them.  However, the risks they singled out from the amorphous assemblage were \nindividualised, reflecting adverse health events experienced or witnessed in their own lives, but \nalso overlaid with interpretations in the light of prominent public discourses that had resonated \nwith them. Participants, in effect deconstructed risk themselves.  Their comments showed their \nrecognition that risk was heterogeneous, always evolving and always open to the appearance of \n                                                          \n10 The paper that sparked the controversy was retracted in September 2019, after acknowledging that it \ncontained \u2018fundamental calculation errors\u2019 (Rucklidge et al 2019). \n93 \n \n \nsomething new and \u2018other\u2019 (Derrida 1997).  They also implicitly recognised the rhizomatic nature \nof risk as something which was connected to a wide variety of actants in the assemblage around \nsupplements, including foods, medicines, the environment, their genetic makeup and familial \ndisposition to disease and to ideas about a \u2018doomed world\u2019.   \nThe focus on risk in this section may give a somewhat misleading impression of the participants \nas a group of over-anxious people, the kind that are dismissively referred to as the \u2018worried well\u2019 \n(Lapsley, 2006; Lentjes, 2019) obsessed with their health status, and constantly on the watch for \nemerging risks that could strike them from within or without.  However, their concerns are not \nout of line with general popular and academic discourses.   An endless stream of studies and \nreports continues to be published that investigates many of the very issues that the participants \nraised and these are taken seriously by the scientific community and a considerable proportion \nof society (Berg\u00e9 et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2014; Kendall et al., 2018; Meeker, 2012; Mink et al., \n2011; Sundstr\u00f6m et al., 2014; Weber et al., 2018). Moreover, the shifting boundaries in the \nclassification of disease through the construct of pre-disease states, create categories of people \nwho are in an ambiguous position between normal health and pathology (Swallow, 2019).  Being \nin this uncertain state leads to even greater feelings of risk and uncertainty and the need to \nrespond to it in some way.  Ironically, it seems that the climate of risk promulgated, at least in \npart, by orthodox medicine, may assist the flourishing of the supplement industry as people such \nas the participants turn to products that they believe will offer protection.  So rather than being \ndisproportionately obsessed with risk, it may be that it is their independent decision making that \nbypasses the need for \u2018expert\u2019 advice that underlies a good deal of the criticism that supplement \nusers attract from health professionals.   \nIndeed, once the participants recognised a risk, they did not dwell on it obsessively, but used \ntheir concerns in a productive way.  They made decisions and took action to address those risks \nthey believed were important in the light of their own experiences and context.  Supplements \noffered a strategy to defuse their anxiety, and get on with living their lives, at least for the time \nbeing.  This was the impression I got from talking to them; that having decided that they could \ndo something about their concerns, they could then set their mind at rest. They did, however, \nappear to view risk as evolving and changing all the time rather than something that they had \ndealt with permanently and were alert to risks that might develop in the future.   \n94 \n \n \nConclusion \nThis chapter has endeavoured to examine and unsettle the concepts that are deeply embedded \nbehind the everyday discourse about supplements and herbal medicines. Naturalness, holistic \nhealth and keeping safe from risk have been discussed at some length to show the wide variety \nof understandings that the participants expressed in their comments.  The assemblage of ideas \nand practices generated from the discussion about these three concepts showed that \nparticipants expressed views ranging from repeating uncontested assumptions to putting \nforward thought-provoking insights about competing meanings that they observed in their own \nor others\u2019 practices.   \nDeconstructing these three discourses in the light of the data from the participants, has revealed \na number of new insights about that go beyond the previous understandings of how naturalness, \nholistic health and risk are related to supplement use.  Firstly, the discussion has shown how \nindividualised and fluid the concepts are; that every participant saw them in a slightly different \nlight.  Rather than simply being gradations of the one idea, the viewpoints put forward stretched \nand contested general assumptions in widely different ways, depending on the individual \nparticipant\u2019s background experiences, their own interpretations of the discourses of the present \nand their concerns about the future.  The variety of perspectives provided by the participants \ndemonstrates how inadequate it is to treat supplement use as a single phenomenon, where \nboth products and their users are \u201clumped together, indistinguishable from each other\u201d (Lewis, \n2019: 840). Secondly, this chapter has highlighted the way that the concepts of naturalness, \nholistic health, and risk are never static, but always open to something new and different in \nrelation to supplement practices.  They are mobilised by users and sellers in an ever-changing \nscene of ideas, interpretations, therapies and products that draw from the past and are \nconstantly evolving into the future.  Thirdly, although the discourses in question have been \ndeconstructed separately here for the purposes of the analysis, all three concepts are deeply \ninterconnected; their entanglement forms a network of random and rich connections that adds \nto the complexity of the assemblage of actants around supplements and their use.  Finally, it is \nimportant to recognise that even though the surface assumptions around these common \ndiscourses can easily be deconstructed to show that each one is diffuse and contested, yet the \nideas of naturalness, holistic health, and risk retain their salience as descriptors around which \nsupplement users and sellers can frame their practices as meaningful to them and others.   \nWithin this vast assemblage, it is the material products of the supplements themselves which \nprovide the connecting point in the network and without which there would be no discussion.  \n95 \n \n \nThe next chapter now turns the spotlight directly on these products and examines the part they \nplay in the assemblage.    \n96 \n \n \nChapter 5: Supplements as lively matter: the importance of \nmaterial things \nIntroduction \nThe previous chapter looked at characteristics that people attribute to supplements.  This \nchapter takes a different angle, examining the capacity of these material products \u2013 \nsupplements and herbal medicines \u2013 to have their own power and presence that create effects \nin the lives of contemporary individuals.  In my interviews with the participants my attention was \ndrawn to the importance that they seemed to place on the physical presence of their \nsupplements, which many had specially assembled for me to view.  This happened in all the \nsettings where I conducted interviews, whether private homes, health stores and pharmacies, or \nin other places where participants brought them along to show me.  These instances were \nenacted so many times during the interviews that they compelled me to take more notice of the \nphysical matter of the supplements and their containers as things of importance in their own \nright, not merely inert objects that were a means to an end in the individuals\u2019 health practices.   \nThis chapter uses materiality thinking from writers such as Coole and Frost (2010), Maclure \n(2015), and especially Bennett (2010) to examine the agency of \u2018things\u2019 to change events and \ncreate effects in people\u2019s lives.  Thinking about things in this way contests the \u201cnotion of nature \nas merely the backdrop for the humanist adventure of culture, or of matter as \u2018dumb\u2019 and \npassive until awakened to meaning by human interest and interpretation\u201d (MacLure, 2015: 96).  \nMateriality thinking views the dualistic idea that considers humans as having agency and matter \nas inert to be anthropocentric and artificial (Bennett, 2010; Law, 1999: 3). It brings back non-\nhuman things into contention, not just as being important in the assemblage of actants, but \nhaving their own agency and energy to:  \n Act as quasi agents or forces with trajectories, propensities, and tendencies of their \nown\u2026.What if they could be considered not simply as a resource, commodity or \ninstrumentality but as an \u2018actant\u2019, something, whether human or non-human, which has \nefficacy, can do things, has sufficient coherence to make a difference, produce effects, \nalter the course of events (Bennett, 2010: viii) \nThe renewed interest in materiality in recent decades has been driven, at least in part, by the \ndevelopment of artificial intelligence, advanced biological techniques, and virtual \ncommunication technologies which have forced humans to recognise that \u201cobjects do not exist \n97 \n \n \nin ontological isolation\u201d (Fraser et al., 2005: 5) but have the power, whether welcome or \nunwelcome, to create an impact on humans.  \nThe problem with writing about \u2018things\u2019 is that any argument put forward is always open to the \ncriticism that things are interpreted by a person, \u201ca self-conscious, language wielding human\u201d \n(Bennett, 2010: 120).  Attributing agency to the non-human, therefore, is elusive and difficult.  \nThe traditional tools provided by language seem to be inadequate for the task of understanding \nnon-human agency.  Bennett herself, has written about the difficulties she encountered in trying \nto write about why things matter, describing it as \u201cboth necessary and impossible\u201d because \nlanguage always assigns \u201cactivity to people and passivity to things\u201d (Bennett, 2010: 119).  One \napproach, according to Coole and Frost (2010), is to engage in a detailed analysis of the material \nobjects which are part of the daily environment.   \nThis chapter, therefore, treats the containers of supplements and herbal medicines that \nparticipants showed me as vital matter, enmeshed with human discourse and activity, but also \nhaving  their own \u201cemergent, generative powers and agentic capacities\u201d (Coole & Frost, 2010: \n9).   Supplements, moreover, are a special category of actant that differ from most other types \nof non-human matter because they are designed to be ingested into the human body.  Bennett \nconsiders edible matter to be a special category of non- human actant because it enters into \nwhat we become as it is metabolised; \u201cthe outside and the inside mingle and recombine\u2026 it \nreveals the swarm of activity subsisting below and within formed bodies and recalcitrant things, \na vitality obscured by our conceptual habit of dividing the world into inorganic matter and \norganic life\u201c(2010: 50-51). Like foodstuffs, the taking of supplements results in a process where \n\u201chuman and nonhuman bodies recorporealise in response to each other; both exercise \nformative power and both offer themselves as matter to be acted on\u201d (Bennett: 2010: 49). \nThe power of edible substances to do good or ill is not difficult to understand; what to ingest and \nwhat not to, has been an enduring motif throughout history and continues to be scrutinised \nintensely from all points of view today.   In religion, folk tales and fairy stories throughout the \nages eating or drinking some kind of substance often catalyses forward action (Pinsent, 2002; \nReddan, 2016); these non-human things may bring magical powers to the human protagonists, \npromote healing, give access to new visions of the world and allow personal growth or \nalternatively they can be a force for evil, corruption, and death.  Outside the realm of myth and \nfairy tale, ingested substances have been the subject of health advice from ancient times \n(Totelin, 2015) and throughout recorded history right up to the present day.  Contemporary \nscientific literature abounds with a wide range of conflicting advice about the things that should \n98 \n \n \nor should not be eaten or drunk for good health (Archer, 2015; Lifschizt & Lifschitz, 2014). There \nis a daily \u201ccacophony of voices\u201d (Mayes 2015: 6) across all media, ranging from medical journals \nciting \u2018alarm\u2019 about rising rates of child obesity or diabetes (Cefalu et al., 2014; Wang et al., \n2017) to popular websites issuing dramatic warnings about the \u201c16 cancer causing foods you \nshould avoid completely\u201d (Bayard, 2019) or the reassuring \u201ctop 10 supplements for preventing \nand reversing Alzheimers\u201d(Rona, 2018).   The intense interest shown by such a diverse range of \nsources suggests that edible things have a particularly potent influence on human lives that goes \nbeyond their analysable nutritional or medicinal components; that these non-human \u2018things\u2019 \nhave their own power and energy to generate effects in people\u2019s lives.    \nTo expand and further develop the concept of the assemblage of actants in which the \nparticipants and their supplement \u2018things\u2019 were enmeshed I have again turned to Deleuze and \nGuattari\u2019s (1987) metaphor of the rhizomatic assemblage with its tangled network of nodes, \nconnections and random lines of flight.  In the assemblage material things and discourses about \nthem are entangled and interconnected; the containers with their capsules, tablets and liquids, \npromotion and marketing activities and discourses, retail outlets, and regulatory regimes, \ntogether with an individual\u2019s biological make up, their past and present experiences, their \ninterpersonal contacts, their cultural background, spiritual beliefs, personality traits, health \npractices, the communication and information sources they use, their shopping habits and \nincome.  It is necessary and important to tease out some of the threads of the assemblage to \ngain some partial insights into how they create effects.  The challenge is, however, to do so in a \nway that does not make them appear linear, isolated, at risk of being reduced to merely a list of \nthis component or that, but retains the idea of their inter-relationship in a dynamic and evolving \nnetwork of connections.   \nThe first half of this chapter focuses on the \u2018things\u2019 that made up the supplement displays \npresented by the participants:  the containers of products and the other material things that the \nparticipants brought to my attention, as well as the physical surroundings where they were \narranged.  I move on to analyse what the participants told me about the physical and \npsychological effects on their wellbeing that they ascribed to these \u2018things.\u2019  I revisit the concept \nof the life force in all things, this time to reflect on what was said and implied about things as \nenablers to spiritual or transcendent experiences and how this linked with participants\u2019 remarks \nabout their wellbeing, and their purpose in life.    \n99 \n \n \nI draw briefly on Bourdieu\u2019s (1990) concept of the habitus to look separately and in combination \nat the cultural histories and social discourses about material things that participants reported \nthey had used in self-care remedies.  In general terms, the habitus has been described as:   \n \u2026a system of schemes of perception and discriminations embodied as disposition \nreflecting the entire history of the [cultural] group and acquired through the formative \nexperiences of childhood.  The structural code of the culture is inscribed as the habitus \nand generates the production of social practice (Nash, 1999: 177).    \nFor individuals, the notion of the habitus refers to the embedded cultural capital that underlies \nbeliefs and assumption about how to behave (Bourdieu, 1990; King, 2000). The habitus has been \nseen as deterministic, limiting and constraining, and a means of social control (Garnham & \nWilliams, 1980), that is, entirely contrary to the concept of the tangled rhizomatic assemblage \nwhich is always unpredictable, changing and becoming.  The two are, however, not necessarily \nopposed; according to McNay (1999), the habitus should not be read in this way, but as a \ngenerative structure which \u201cestablishes an active and creative relation\u201d between an individual \nand the world, giving rise to a wide variety of behaviour patterns,  though remaining only \n\u201crelatively unpredictable\u201d (McNay 1999: 100-101).  Dovey (2011) directly links Bourdieu and \nDeleuze and Guattari\u2019s thinking, showing how the two, although they have differences, are \nconceptually connected:     \nBoth habitus and assemblage are immanent to everyday life rather than transcendent \nabstractions; the rules of the habitus can be read as codes of the assemblage.  \u2026. the \nmajor contrast is that Bourdieu stresses the inertia embedded in the habitus, whereas \nDeleuze and Guatarri stress flow, change and potential (Dovey 2011: 350-51).  \nWhile the supplements remain the \u2018things\u2019 of key focus, in the second half of the chapter I look \nat a range of other actants that were prominent in the evolving assemblage and were connected \nwith the participants and their supplement practices.  These include the cell phones and \ncomputers that participants used to find what they wanted to know about products and where \nto get them, or to search for information about the kind of treatments that might be useful for \nparticular health needs they had.  They also include the online systems that track what \nindividuals are looking for and amass sets of data that allow companies to target them with \npromotions for products they are likely to find relevant.  I note the way the participants were \nengaged in different ways with all these actants, but at the same time were actants in the \n100 \n \n \nassemblage themselves, caught up in a dynamic process of evolution that linked the human and \nnon-human.     \nThe power of the material product  \nBy far the majority of my interviews for the study took place in the participants\u2019 homes and \nnearly all of them invited me to view a display of their supplements.   Often the person I was \ninterviewing had arranged their bottles and jars on a table or other surface in a relatively public \nspace of their home apparently specially for our meeting (see Figure 1 below).  These were often \naccompanied by offers of hospitality.  Others showed me in to more private areas of their \nkitchen or bedroom to point out their supplements in their usual place in a pantry or on a shelf.  \nA few of the participants who had chosen to meet me in my office or a caf\u00e9 also brought their \nproducts along to show me.  As if following a script known to them all (although none of them \nknew one another) they pointed to them or picked them up one by one, telling me where they \nbought each one, which brand they favoured and why.   \n \nFigure 1: Supplement products arranged for showing.  Author\u2019s photo simulation. \n \n101 \n \n \nA similar phenomenon on a parallel scale occurred in most of the health stores and pharmacies I \nvisited.  While these were shop displays for the public rather than a private home, the \nparticipants who showed me round demonstrated that they were just as personally invested in \ntheir products as the people I had visited at home. The person I was interviewing would invite \nme on a viewing tour of their \u2018natural health\u2019 section.  They walked me through it, explaining \nwhy they stocked the particular ranges, the brands they preferred and why, and the emphasis \nthey placed on the quality of the various products they sold. There was the same focus on the \nsupplements\u2019 materiality, the packages of \u2018things\u2019.  This was in spite of the information I had \nsent out to all participants explaining that I was interested in how and why people came to be \nregular supplement users or sellers, and not in the details of what they took or what they sold.  \nInitially I considered these displays to be a distraction I needed to get past so I could ask the \nquestions I had formulated, but as it happened again and again, I realised I was in danger of \noverlooking something vitally important about the power and presence of these material \u2018things\u2019 \nin the participants\u2019 lives; that they represented people\u2019s \u201chopes, imaginings and desires\u2026 an \nelement in identity construction, moralities, routines, relationships, care, healing and home \nmaking\u201d (Hodgetts et al., 2011: 353).  \nAn interesting aspect of the displays was that the supplements and their containers appeared to \nbe one and the same thing.  In the entire course of the study, not one of the participants ever \nopened up a container to show me the contents and no one commented on the respective \nformats (tablets versus capsules or liquids), the type of coating, or any other characteristic.  The \nphysical appearance or the texture of the \u2018things\u2019 that were ingested appeared to be a matter in \nwhich no one was interested.  Later, when reflecting on this, I found that the same phenomenon \nheld true for the marketing and promotional literature that I collected during the study; there \nwere no images of the tablets, capsules or liquids, either on their own, or being taken by people.  \nThe container and its contents appeared to be synonymous \u2013 a total package, but one that was \nloaded with meaning beyond its mundane appearance.  The package and the understanding \nabout its contents seemed to symbolise meaningful experiences and events in the individual \nparticipant\u2019s life that had come together in these material things and which formed an \nimportant part of their story that they wanted me to hear. The communicative and symbolic \npower of packaging is well recognised:    \n Packaging is tangible in nature, a three dimensional marketing communication vehicle \nthat is integrally tied to the product offering.  The package resides in the home [or on \n102 \n \n \nthe shelf] potentially becoming part of the consumer\u2019s life; a phenomenon that \nrepresents a type of lived experience (Underwood, 2003: 62).   \nCompelling product packaging, however, seemed to be only a partial and largely unsatisfactory \nexplanation for what I had witnessed in my visits to the participants.  Their displays of products \nalso brought to mind the incense, flowers, fruits and other everyday objects I had seen displayed \non altars in Hindu or Buddhist households, or descriptions I had read of the altars to the \nhousehold gods of the Romans \u2013 the Lares and Penates - where offerings such as wheat, honey, \nand wine were placed as part of private religious practices (Bodel, 2008). I experienced the same \nfeeling of \u2018thing power\u2019 that Bennett (2010: 4) has described; the containers of supplements \n\u201cissued a call \u2026 I caught a glimpse of an energetic vitality inside each of these things, things that I \ngenerally conceived of as inert\u201d.   \nWhile these displays were one way that the \u2018thing power\u2019 showed itself in the study, it was not \nthe only one.  Quite a different manifestation occurred in a small group of participants, all of \nwhom were involved in a professional capacity with selling products and providing advice or \ntherapy to members of the public.    In contrast to the majority of participants who were so \nclearly positively engaged with their supplements, these few took pains to distance themselves \nfrom any personal investment in the \u2018things\u2019.  Their comments seemed to be designed to \nconstruct themselves to me as being only peripherally engaged with the supplement side of \ntheir workplace.  One referred several times to having a hands-off approach to the \u2018natural \nhealth\u2019 side of the business, and that the day-to-day activities were left to \u201cthe girls\u201d (Lyndsay) \nto manage.  Another, rather than giving a personal view, cited the general approach of their \nworkplace in neutral terms:  \n  We operate in what I would say is a traditional pharmacy way that everyone knows \nmost things\u2026 so any member of staff has to be able to help with any area, but we do \nhave  a member of staff who primarily looks after that area [natural health products]\u2026 \n(Jo)   \nThe use of \u2018we\u2019 rather than \u2018I\u2019 which was noticeable among this group of participants, seemed to \nbe a way of contributing to the discussion but remaining non-committal.  As Morison and \nMacLeod (2014: 696) point out, words that are used to cover a \u2018silence\u2019 may serve to mask an \nunwillingness to talk about a potentially sensitive topic, but also give hints about concerns which \nare unacknowledged.   The comments were carefully neutral, acting as means of being \ncooperative with the study, and saying something, but ensuring that their own attitude as to \n103 \n \n \nwhat supplements might or might not do was not stated.  To me, this silencing of the personal,  \nmuch in contrast with the behaviour of the other participants, highlighted the tension involved \nin balancing a proactive health professional role with the commercial drivers of working in a \nretail business (Thompson & Bidwell, 2015). The viability of such a business depends on being \nable to sell \u2018things\u2019 and retain customers, but these same things may be an uncomfortable fit \nwith the need to retain the respect of their medical and research colleagues who are generally \nunenthusiastic about the sale of supplements directly to the general public (Jefferies et al., 2012; \nMartinez et al., 2012; Slashinski et al., 2012; Ventola, 2010). Their distancing suggested, not that \nthey were indifferent or uninterested, but that the products they sold also had a complementary \n\u2018thing\u2019 power that potentially threatened their professional identities.  Nevertheless, whether \nparticipants were deeply engaged with their products like the majority, or took care to \u2018silence\u2019 \nthem like the few, it was clear that the material supplements had the power to cause effects for \nthose who engaged with them. The next section of the chapter looks at the participants\u2019 reports \nof the physical and psychological effects they had experienced from the supplements that they \ntook.   \nThings for the body and mind  \nThe lived body crosses both the biological and social worlds. People have a body, a physical \nentity, but their body is also who they are, how they interact with the world, how they feel and \nexperience sensation, how they think, reflect and act (Fox, 2012; Sointu, 2013):     \nThe possession of a physical body, its mediation between the world around us on one \nhand and our internal world of thoughts, feelings and sensations on the other, is \nfundamental to the human experience (Fox 2012:1) \nWhen the body is in robust health, it tends to be taken for granted (Corbin, 2003). Only when \nsomething goes awry, such as pain or illness, is attention suddenly brought to bear on the body \nand what it can or cannot do (Fox, 2012; Lawton, 2003). Chronic conditions that cannot be \npermanently \u2018fixed\u2019 but must be lived with, in particular, bring attention to a body that is \nreluctant to cooperate with what an individual would like to do (see Fox 2012: 27-30).  A number \nof participants (though far from all of them) were in this category; some had conditions that had \nbeen medically diagnosed such as diabetes, arthritis, or hypertension, others had more nebulous \nconcerns like unexplained abdominal pain, sleep issues, pain from old sports injuries or recurring \nbouts of low mood.  Some of these participants had been through medical investigations or \ntreatment while others had not, but all of them appeared to have become aware that their \n104 \n \n \nbodies were imperfect and they would need to cope with living with them as best they could.  It \nwas this realisation that seemed to have been the connection with one of the tangled threads of \nthe assemblage surrounding the supplement \u2018thing\u2019; it offered an avenue to explore in the hope \nthat they might find a way of managing a condition they could not change.  Some of them \nreported considerable success, outlining in our discussion how these \u2018things\u2019 had effected \nimprovements for them once they made the decision to take them.   \nMurray, for example, had been involved in running and rowing for years when younger and was \na keen tennis player.  He had developed joint problems over the years and had a \u2018bad hip\u2019 but \nreported that he had found products through a network marketing company had been able to \nkeep him fully active in spite of his initial scepticism about them:  \nA friend of mine \u2026. was interested in alternative health and so on \u2026 he told me.  So as I \nsay, the rest\u2019s history\u2026I didn\u2019t believe in them [supplements] in the 90s but I\u2019ve got \nosteoarthritis in the right hip and it was bothering me and so for the last fifteen and a \nhalf years I\u2019ve been on their products and I lead a normal life.  It won\u2019t cure it but I\u2019ve got \nquality and comfort level that is sustainable and not bothersome. (Murray) \nCaro had a history of leg cramps, especially at night which had become so bad that they \ndisrupted her sleep and that of her husband as well:     \nI\u2019d gone into one of those health shops and I heard the lady talking to the shop assistant \nabout this, so I said to the lady, tell me about it.  Because people say you\u2019ve got to take \nmagnesium.  \u2026. whether I\u2019m doing right, I don\u2019t know but it\u2019s working for me.  \u2026  And I \ndon\u2019t even have to tell my husband and push him out of bed anymore!  So that\u2019s how bad \nI was.  I mean, I cramp, but I can feel it and I can manage it.  I\u2019m managing it. (Caro) \nThe material product, as she reported, had created a positive effect, and the interconnection \nwith what she had heard \u2018people say\u2019 appeared to reinforce for her that she was managing \nsomething that had previously been troublesome.  She does not suggest her problem has \ndisappeared, but only that she can now cope with it better.  Some of these reports had elements \nof the \u2018transformation narratives\u2019 that occur in accounts of religious conversion (Popp-Baier, \n2001), or turning one\u2019s life around after a criminal past (Liem & Richardson, 2014). In the case of \nthe participants, it was the supplement product which appeared in the right place at the right \ntime, and acted as a catalyst to change (Bennett 2010: 9). As with these reports from other areas \nof life, the central idea in participants\u2019 stories seemed to be the preservation of a core sense of \nself and the regaining of a sense of control and agency over the future that the \u2018thing power\u2019 of \n105 \n \n \nthe supplements had given them.  While some of their narratives mentioned particular \nsupplements which they had found helpful, the key point was less about a particular product  \nand more focused on being enabled to overcome a barrier that was in their way and \u201cget on \nwith life\u201d (Cartwright, 2007: 1692).  This increased optimism and coping parallels reports in other \nstudies of supplement users (Joos et al., 2012; Oldham et al., 2004; Sointu, 2013).      \nThe physical problems that the participants talked about, however, were far outnumbered by \nthe number of times they focused on stress and their need to have a physical \u2018thing\u2019 that would \ndeal with it.  Supplements seemed to be particularly valued for stress, partly because of their \nnaturalness, as outlined in the previous chapter, but also because they were a thing that could \nbe grasped to fill a gap where there were few alternatives.  Almost every participant raised the \nissue of stress at some point; most often it was not related to any particular circumstance, \nillness, or injury, but a low-level, undefined feeling of being worn down from meeting the \nexpectations that they had set for themselves in daily life:  They spoke of stress as if it were self-\nexplanatory, taking it for granted that I knew and understood what it was:  \n\u2026when you\u2019re stressed \u2026  when you\u2019re rushed you\u2019re eating not as good as you normally \nwould \u2026 you\u2019re not getting as many nutrients as your body needs but you are also not \ntaking that time out to help it repair \u2026 and that goes on continually \u2026 making bad \nchoices round food, that add to the stress and not feeling well and that\u2019s when I have .\u2026 \nlook[ed] at the bottle and it says, this will help you feel more energetic \u2026 you know, \nbalance up everything because you\u2019re kind of thinking maybe I\u2019m not balanced in what \nI\u2019m taking in.  (Tracy) \nTracy here draws on ideas of nutritional imbalance and modern life as being too busy, resulting \nin an unease about \u2018bad choices\u2019 that keep happening because she is rushed.  However, she \nfinds a suitable \u2018thing\u2019 to take as a way of countering the rushed and inadequately nutritious \nmeals and setting at rest the feeling of stress she has about not taking care of herself when she \nknows that she should be.  She verbally sketches out an easily imaginable vignette that portrays \nher in a shop looking at the bottle - a graspable, material thing \u2013 that she hopes will do \nsomething to help.  It seems that in her mind she already attributes these \u2018things\u2019 with the \n\u201cactive power to affect and create effects\u201d (Bennett 2010: 49) and that will take care of the \nbalance in her diet.   \nStress has been conceptualised in a range of different ways: as physiological (Rees, 1976; Selye, \n1973); as a psychological reaction to negative experiences (Somerfield & McCrae, 2000); or as a \n106 \n \n \nmind/body interaction that contributes to conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, \nauto-immune disease and slow wound healing (Chida et al., 2008; Cohen et al., 2007; Reiche et \nal., 2004; Thaker et al., 2007). A feature of stress is the \u201cstrange circular way [it] seems to stand \non its own as a plausible, complete, self-contained explanation\u201d (Monroe, 2008: 47) in both \nscientific and popular literature:  \nEverybody knows what stress is and nobody knows what it is\u2026 although it has become \npart of our daily vocabulary.  Is it effort, fatigue, pain, fear, the need for concentration, \nthe humiliation of censure, loss of blood, or even an unexpected success that requires \ncomplete reformulation of one\u2019s life?  \u2026 Every one of these conditions can produce \nstress, and yet none of them can be singled out as being \u2018it\u2019 (Selye 1973: 692).     \nThe indeterminate and subjective nature of stress makes it resistant to being \u2018fixed\u2019 particularly \nwhen the conditions that produced the stress cannot be changed.  However, it seemed that the \n\u2018thing power\u2019 of supplements is something that can be mobilised to fill this gap.  Kerry, who \nmanaged a \u2018natural health\u2019 section in a pharmacy, reported that many of her customers found \nsupplements to be an appealing method for addressing concerns about the constant effect of \nstress on their health:   \nIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you think it\u2019s stressful and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s stressful, it\u2019s how \nyou perceive it and at what level you cope with it.  It\u2019s quite a big thing and it does open \nyou up for multivitamins, sleeping, something to help with that\u2026  (Kerry) \nKerry\u2019s remark here draws attention to the individuality of stress and that it is not up to her to \njudge what is stressful that matters, but whether the person she is assisting finds supplements \nto be a useful way of dealing with what is bothering them.  Parents of young children in \nparticular often featured in the discussions about stress.  The participants who worked in health \nstores and pharmacies reported that they were often asked for advice by busy parents who \nappeared to be stressed by the dual demands of being under pressure at their workplaces and \nnot wishing to take time off, but also caring for children who had to be kept away from school or \nday care when they were sick with coughs and colds especially during winter. Interestingly, \nalthough it was the parents who appeared stressed, the supplement products they bought were \nfor their children; \u2018immunity boosters\u2019 to help prevent illness, (homeopathic) \u2018sleep drops\u2019 for \nbabies to try to help the household get some rest, and herbal products for soothing children\u2019s \ncoughs and colds. Neither the parents nor the retailers seemed convinced that the products \nwere particularly effective; indeed, several participants noted that for coughs at least, the \n107 \n \n \ntraditional lemon and honey drinks were likely to be just as good.  However, the \u2018thing power\u2019 of \nthe bought product appeared to be more sought after than the \u2018thing\u2019 that could be made at \nhome.  It appeared that by searching out and finding a product, parents could feel they had done \neverything possible to keep their child well.  For their part, the pharmacists and health store \nstaff also had a concrete product \u2013 a material thing \u2013 to offer, and one that could be used \nimmediately.   \nYou [the parents] feel better because you have done something.  You feel better and that \nchild feeds off that and feels better.  I think there is an element of that \u2026so much of what \nwe [the staff] are dealing with here is reassurance particularly for parents.  (Jo) \nProviding simple advice, even if the home remedy was potentially as useful as the commercial \nproduct, would mean that the people seeking help would be sent away empty handed (without \na \u2018thing\u2019) and, moreover, add to their stress by having the additional burden of going elsewhere \nto buy the lemons and honey if they were not already in stock and then making them up when \nthey arrived home. Participants who sold these types of products noted that they provided only \nthose which they were confident would not do any harm, and that the main benefit was likely to \nbe reduced anxiety and eased tension for individuals or households.      \nThe effect of the \u2018thing\u2019 they bought could not necessarily be explained in material terms but \nseemed to \u2018work\u2019 all the same, even though the product filled a different role for the parent and \nchild respectively. That is not to discount the possibility that the properties of particular \nsubstances remain to be discovered, given the fact that many are poorly researched and that \nnew evidence emerges from time to time about the properties of even the most common of \nvitamins and minerals (Aghajanian et al., 2015; Carr & McCall, 2017; Lapillonne, 2010; Nowson et \nal., 2012). As Marchant (2016: 298) points out, \u201cthe medicine we end up with depends on the \ntrials that are carried out\u201d, so that if no trials have been done on a substance, then it will ipso \nfacto be considered ineffective.   \nWhen the mechanism of effect cannot be explained, the placebo response is often invoked.  At \none time thinking about placebos implied that they were a \u201ctreatment for neurotic patients \nwhen the clinician has nothing better to offer\u201d (McQueen et al., 2013: 162). Current thinking, \nhowever, has moved beyond this dismissive attitude, with more nuanced concepts being put \nforward.  One of them, expectancy theory  (McQueen et al., 2013; Schwarz et al., 2016), has \nbeen proposed as a way of explaining why a certain proportion of people in the placebo arm of \n108 \n \n \ndrug trials will improve in spite of not receiving any active components.  However, as several \nparticipants pointed out, this does not explain the effect in babies or animals:   \nWe had a dog where we used homeopathics and their psoriasis disappeared.  The dog \ndidn\u2019t believe it.  We had a baby who had some issues and we used homeopathics and \nthe baby improved; the baby didn\u2019t believe it.  (Jordan) \nRecent investigations of the placebo effect have reported that it may be the result of natural \nopioids that are released from the brain, indicating that people are effectively self-medicating \n(Wager et al., 2007: 11060). But even these studies have concluded that the full picture is not \nyet understood and that the placebo effect is likely to be a diverse group of phenomena rather \nthan having a single explanation (Marchant, 2016; Wager & Atlas, 2015).  \nA number of participants commented on the placebo concept as a possibility for the effects they \nreported experiencing from their supplements, but went on to remark that, even if that were \nthe case, they considered it to be unimportant.  Tessa, for example, was well aware that the \nhomeopathic remedy she used was unsupported by \u2018evidence\u2019, but found it irrelevant, saying \nthat \u201cI swear rescue remedy works for me\u201d.   As one participant remarked,  \nIf people think it works, then it does work for them.  If it makes them sleep better and \nthey feel better then that\u2019s fantastic.  Isn\u2019t that what we want? (Kerry) \nIt could also be argued that reassurance and the handing over of a \u2018thing\u2019 from a pharmacy or \nhealth store borrows from the function of the paper prescription for medicines that is handed to \nthe patient by the doctor at the end of a medical consultation and then dispensed by a \npharmacist.   The paper prescription has been described by Cooper (2011) as a \u2018boundary \nobject\u2019, that is, it has equal salience across the worlds of the prescriber, the patient and the \npharmacist.  It symbolises the professional authority of the doctor, while also serving to instruct \nthe pharmacist what to dispense and reassure the patient their concerns have been taken \nseriously and the doctor has \u2018done something\u2019.  Boundary objects act as a \u2018common coin\u2019 that \nworks within the \u201cconstraints of the parties employing them but are robust enough to maintain \na common identity across all of them\u201d (Star & Griesemer, 1989: 393). In the case of \nsupplements, handing over of \u2018things\u2019 to be taken as capsules, tablets or liquid in a pharmacy or \nhealth store, even though there is no doctor or paper prescription involved, may be seen as \nacting in a similar way, bridging the culturally defined boundary between the spheres of \northodox and alternative health practice (Derkatch, 2008; Fox, 2011: 70; Owens, 2015). The \nsupplement products may be invested with the same expectations that are associated with a \n109 \n \n \nprescribed medicine, particularly if the individual buys their supplies from the same pharmacy \nwhere they have their medicines dispensed.  Moreover, the people buying supplements in \npharmacies may already know the pharmacist who gives them advice about both prescribed and \nover-the-counter products for their health needs and therefore view them as trustworthy based \non previous experience.      \nA number of participants acknowledged that the reassurance of \u2018doing something\u2019 was at least \npartly responsible for a sense of improvement.  A few of them talked about a special person or \nbusiness that they trusted - a pharmacist, natural therapist, or health store manager - from \nwhom they took advice that they had always found helpful.  However, most others, in contrast,  \nsimply shopped around for products they had read or heard about, whether in a walk-in store or \nonline, and were satisfied with being able to have independent and immediate access to the \n\u2018thing\u2019  without the mediation of any advisor or \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 to recommend it or provide \nguidance and reassurance.  With or without advice, however, it required more than just  \nreassurance alone; a material product appeared to be indispensable for participants to feel that \nthey were \u2018doing something\u2019.   As one participant commented, if simple reassurance that one \nwas \u2018doing something\u2019 worked, then why would supplements work for some people when \npharmaceuticals prescribed by a doctor had failed to?  \n\u2026 if the placebo thing was going to have an effect it would have an effect with the doctor \nand the medical agents, because that\u2019s their [my customers\u2019] strong belief.  They didn\u2019t \ncome to me first.  They gave up, walked in the door and said, \u201cwhat have you got here?\u201d   \n(Bernie) \nHere Bernie constructs himself as being a place of last resort for those who have \u2018given up\u2019 on \nformal medical intervention. However, rather than suggesting that he too can provide such \nreassurance, he went on to talk in detail about the specific \u2018things\u2019 he was able to offer that \nothers did not, including particular products, special tests that were sent for analysis and \nreferrals to a medical herbalist who was more qualified than he, and able to prescribe things he \ncould not.    \nNone of the participants appeared to be concerned about finding a definitive explanation for \nhow or why their supplements created the effects they reported.  They seemed to be open to \nsupplements being more than simply for physical and mental wellbeing but also having a calming \nspiritual effect. Being spiritually at ease is acknowledged to be an important part of being truly \nhealthy (Egan, 2010; Goddard, 1995; Holmes, 2010). Spirituality has been described as \u201c\u2018the \n110 \n \n \nprimordial thing\u2019\u2026the engine that propels the search for connectedness, meaning, purpose and \ncontribution. \u2026it speaks to what it means to be human\u201d (Benson & Roehlkepartain, 2008).  The \nfollowing section looks at the various ways the participants linked this \u2018primordial thing\u2019 with \ntheir material supplement products.    \nThings for the spirit \nParticipants commented both directly and by implication that a spiritual aspect was linked to \ntheir supplement taking.  Cliff, for example, who sent away for the etherium gold product \nmentioned in the previous chapter as being linked to the Pharoahs, found that taking it was \u2018a \nvery spiritual thing.\u201d  More numerous, however, were those participants who did not overtly \nspeak of spirituality as such but indicated they were searching for something beyond physical or \nmental health; a longing for a sense of purpose, an existential need to come to terms with their \nown imperfect condition, to find some \u2018thing\u2019 that would fill an empty space in their lives even \nthough they lived with every material comfort:   \nWe think we should be perfect; we think our life should be perfect.  Because, look, we\u2019ve \ngot everything at our disposal.  And then we get really shocked when life isn\u2019t quite like \nthat.  We have money to spend, we have all this stuff going for us, and yet we\u2019re still not \nhappy.  \u2026 Inner peace, inner calm \u2026 I think people are searching for that and they\u2019re not \nsure how to embrace it without \u2013 maybe going to church.  You know, how do I live a \nspiritual life that isn\u2019t based on whether I\u2019m an Anglican or a Methodist, or becoming a \nBuddhist nun? (Tessa) \nIngested substances have been interwoven with spiritual practices since ancient times (Berlant, \n2005; Sayin, 2014); traditions of fasting from foods, offering or sacrificing foods to a higher \nbeing, religious rituals to be observed before eating, prohibited foods, and symbolic foods that \nrepresent deeper spiritual realities are found in most belief systems (Dietler, 2011). Depriving \nthe physical body by abstaining from foods in order to reach a purer state of spiritual \nenlightenment is found in a number of religions (Lambert, 2003); ingesting herbal substances \naccompanied by prayers or incantations are used in others, and sometimes the two approaches \nare combined (Jones & Olsan, 2015). The idea that greater spiritual insight is achieved by \ndepriving the body of comfort tends to construct the body and soul as opposing forces; the body \nas a source of sin and a barrier to salvation of the soul (Glucklich, 2001). Contemporary \nspirituality, in contrast, tends to view the perfect body as a spiritual force in itself, harmonious \nand serene, rather than being conflicted between the desires of the body and the aspirations of \n111 \n \n \nthe spirit (Giordan, 2009). Therefore ingesting things with the aim of perfecting the body \nbecomes an end in itself.  In essence, however, the two approaches share the same idea of being \non a quest towards perfection, and to overcome the limitations of the body bound by physical \nillness or psychological dysfunction.  Non-human things, often including the taking of \nsubstances, have always been implicated in this quest.   \n The idea that inanimate things have spiritual force is found in many indigenous belief systems \n(Donald, 2012; James, 2015). For M\u0101ori too, whakapapa (geneology) links animate and \ninanimate, known and unknown phenomena in the terrestrial and spiritual worlds (Roberts et \nal., 1995; Taonui, 2014).  Entities are not separated into human and non\u2013human but everything \nin the universe is considered to be connected, with each individual being connected to things in \nthe natural environment: \n   Belief in God is one reflection of wairua [spirituality] but it is also evident in relationships \nwith the environment.  Without a spiritual awareness and a mauri (spirit or vitality, \nsometimes called the life force) an individual cannot be healthy and is more prone to \nillness or misfortune.  Land, lakes, mountains, reefs, have a spiritual significance \u2026 \n[access to] the natural environment is considered integral to identity and fundamental \nto a sense of wellbeing (Durie, 1994: 71).  \n \nThe non-human environmental features of their birth place are part of identity for all M\u0101ori \npeople.  Spirituality or wairua is one of the four cornerstones of health in the M\u0101ori world view \nalong with physical, mental, and family health (Durie, 1994). All of these are equally important \nfor a healthy individual, family and society as a whole.  The substances used in traditional M\u0101ori \nmedicine (rongo\u0101) are therefore always considered to have an intrinsically spiritual aspect. \nSeveral of the participants spoke about the interconnectedness of medicinal substances, \nspirituality, and health.  Caro, for example, who was familiar with M\u0101ori rongo\u0101, spoke about her \nbelief that swallowing any kind of medicine in isolation from other aspects of a person\u2019s life was \nunlikely to \u2018fix\u2019 anyone\u2019s problems, whether M\u0101ori or non-M\u0101ori.  She referred to the way \nrongo\u0101 had been used in her family, which had always been \u201cabout the pre-prayer and your \nwhole holistic being.\u201d \nThese ideas are connected to the concept of the life-force that unites all things (Erickson, 2007; \nRicard, 2011), and which is central to one view of holism, as discussed in the previous chapter.  \nIn this view, non-human things can generate healing but cannot be expected to do so unless \nembedded in a wider context of spiritual awareness about the interconnectedness of all things, \n112 \n \n \nboth human and non-human.  Lou spoke about his conception of the interconnectedness \nbetween the body and spirit that mobilised the power of things to have effects on people \ningesting substances:  \n\u2026 if you try to divorce the spiritual side of somebody and put that in a little box and say \nthat\u2019s not relevant because we are trying to treat the body here, to my mind that is \nactually duping yourself really because a person\u2019s belief will start spiritually and affects \nthe whole way they\u2019re taking the medicine, respond to it.   (Lou)  \nOther participants too, referred to the essential part that spirituality played in health.  Tracy \nlikened a person without spirituality to a chair or table with one leg missing so that even if the \nproblems of the physical body were treated with things, there would always be an \nincompleteness and a lack of balance within that person.      \nThe feeling of incompleteness is also prominent in religious thought, reflecting the idea of the \nlifelong search for God, or Nirvana, or however a particular religion conceptualises ultimate \nBeing.  As the early Christian Saint Augustine wrote, \u201cour heart is restless, until it rests in you, O \nGod\u201d (Kreeft, 2016: 21).  Some researchers have argued that material prosperity has created \ndissatisfaction if there is nothing to fill the vacuum created by the formal religious belief.  The \nwish to experience something beyond the mundane is therefore behind the surge in popular \ninterest in exploring forms of spirituality that derive from ancient belief systems unfamiliar to \npeople in developed countries. These include Ayurdevic, indigenous and traditional Chinese \nmedicines, but can also include \u2018New Age\u2019 spirituality, pantheistic religions, and metaphysical \ntraditions (Cobb et al., 2012).  The \u2018things\u2019 of these religions appear to be part of the appeal, \nlinked to ideas of the exotic, \u2019other\u2019 that were outlined in the previous chapter.  One participant \ndrew attention to this point, noting that, in his view, a focus on the \u2018things\u2019 themselves without \nthe wider context of spirituality was ultimately unsatisfying:  \nI would say some people want a pot pourri.  My meaning is that they will get those \ntraditional medicines if they are going to help a bit; they\u2019ll get natural medicines; they\u2019ll \ngo to a meditation class; they\u2019ll do something else \u2013 the aim being some of this must help \nso I will go for all I can do to get help, excluding the fact that actually maybe a really \nconsistent spiritual side might be the answer to what they need anyway.  (Lou) \nThe attraction of these alternative healing therapies has been interpreted as part of \u201cpost-\nChristian\u201d spirituality in Western countries, presenting an alternative to both Christian faith and \nsecular rationalism, perfecting the body in order to \u201cbecome better versions of [themselves] \n113 \n \n \nemotionally and spiritually\u2026\u201d (Brownell, 1991; Cederstrom & Spicer, 2015: 12; Marzano-Parisoli, \n2001; Sheldon, 2010).   Although bodily perfection tends to be viewed as a recent phenomenon, \nthe body as a spiritual project can be traced back to the early Christian era and to classical \nantiquity (Shilling, 2002). In the late modern age, however, what was once a nearly universal \nbelief in the soul\u2019s progress towards the divine \u2018other\u2019 as the purpose of life on earth has come \nto be replaced by a belief in \u201cthe body the starting point for accessing the spiritual dimension of \nexperience\u201d (Giordan, 2009: 230).   \nThose involved do not pursue meaning and identity from pre-given authoritative \nsources, located outside the self (e.g., the answers offered by science and the Christian \nchurches), but want to rely on an internal source, located in the self\u2019s deeper layers\u2026 \nthe late-modern condition conjures up nagging questions that haunt the late-modern \nself:  What is it that I really want? Is this the sort of life I want to live?  What sort of \nperson am I really? (Houtman & Aupers, 2007: 307,309).     \nA number of participants reflected this idea of a missing dimension in their life, but they were \nunable to pinpoint it to anything specific that was wrong.  Though they did not refer directly to \nthe lack of a spiritual dimension themselves, what they said implied to me that they felt a gap in \ntheir lives and were searching for something meaningful to fill it and make their lives feel \ncomplete. Turning to material things appeared to be one avenue that they were exploring; \nfinding \u2018things\u2019 that might fill the gap and hoping that these ingested substances would address \nthe nebulous feeling that something in their life was lacking or out of place:     \n\u2026  if I feel like I might be lacking in something \u2026It\u2019s probably just from reading bits and \npieces and thinking, oh, that makes sense.  You think, well, we are full of minerals and \nvitamins and all sorts of things, if something\u2019s a bit out of kilter to me it makes sense that \nif you are lacking in something you may well need a top up of something else. (Frances) \nFrances\u2019 comment here has echoes of the idea that Tracy put forward of being \u2018out of balance\u2019, \nthat is, missing some kind of important element that is needed to make up the whole person.  \nThese ideas are clearly linked to holism and to have an underlying spiritual dimension but \nFrances here focuses on the physical body.  It appears, from her comment, that she has nothing \novertly wrong, but she still feels she is \u2018lacking\u2019 and a product with vitamin and mineral \u2018things\u2019 \nthat she can ingest to  \u2018top up\u2019 , is a way of satisfying this feeling of incompleteness.   \nAnother motif in participants\u2019 comments was the attraction of ingesting \u2018things\u2019 that cleansed.  \nThe notion of \u2018dirt\u2019 within the body that needs cleansing is a profoundly spiritual concept linking \n114 \n \n \nback to ancient ideas of ritual purity and defilement, with \u2018dirt\u2019  being an ancient symbol of \nambiguity, disorder and danger (Douglas, 1966), that is, something with negative \u2018thing\u2019 power.  \nSeeking cleansing in a spiritual sense is deeply ingrained in many ancient traditions. M\u0101ori \ntikanga (the correct way of doing things) for example designates all things as either sacred (tapu) \nor profane/ordinary (noa) and prescribes rituals for the correct way to behave, for example, with \nbody waste or the handling of human tissue, that are still powerful  and observed today (Cheung \net al., 2007). The Jewish and Christian traditions both feature the need for purification and \ncleansing from sin; in Christianity the water of baptism washes away original sin, and in the Old \nTestament of the Bible, the Psalmist proclaims the need to be cleansed:  \nGod in your goodness wash me clean of my guilt, purify me from my sin \u2026wash me until \nI am whiter than snow (Psalm 51:2,6). \nSome of the participants\u2019 comments on cleansing clearly invoked a spiritual dimension, providing \nadditional and complementary insights to those that raised cleansing as a protection against risk \nwhich were discussed in the previous chapter.  Cleansing in this context had characteristics of a \nritual undertaken for its own sake, intrinsically worthwhile, rather than in response to any kind \nof risk. Cleansing was a special feature of a range of products from a network marketing \ncompany that Molly used herself and also sold to others:     \n They [the company] talk about cleanses a lot\u2026  we are of the understanding that our \nbody needs a break from time to time and that is why you have these cleanse days, or \nthey talk about you have a \u201ccleanse for life\u201d once a day, which is just a drink and you \ndrink that.  I love the idea of a cleanse \u2026 (Molly) \nThe appeal of the \u201ccleanse for life\u201d here, though clearly more commercialised and centred \naround a \u2018thing\u2019, echoes the themes of purity and ritual cleansing that, according to Lupton, live \non in modern obsessions about hygiene, and anxiety about viruses and infections which \u201creveal \ndeeper concerns about the integrity of the body in an age where potential contaminants are \ninvisible\u201d (Lupton 2013: 36).   The fear of having others see you as \u2018dirty\u2019 and unable to control \nyour bodily wastes (Lupton 2013: 187) appears to lie behind the promotion of the many \nproducts that are sold to reduce body odours, or sanitise parts of the body in contemporary \nsociety.   Moreover, what is \u2018dirty\u2019 and therefore in need of cleaning/cleansing is socially and \nculturally constructed across different societies and different epochs in the same society; \u201cwhat \nis unclean in relation to one thing may be clean in relation to another, and vice versa\u201d (Douglas, \n1966: 9).  \u2018Dirty\u2019 as an insult, has a long history in many cultures and its use seldom relates to \n115 \n \n \nbeing physically dirty, but is more often directed at people who stand out from the social norm \nby their behaviour, different appearance (Douglas, 1966), or are thought of as inferior, \nuncivilised or unfit to participate in society (Boullosa & Schnee, 2013; Colloredo-Mansfeld, 1998; \nGuimares, 2003; Paredes, 2007).    \nClosely related to cleansing is the idea of \u2018toxins\u2019, another currently popular way of expressing \nfear of inner dirt and contamination.  Rather than ideas of physical risk, as discussed previously, \nthe idea of inner toxins that must be purged appears to relate to spiritual rather than physical \nunease (Rindfleish, 2005; Russo-Netzer & Mayseless, 2017). Dozens of recipes for detoxing \nthings - pills, or drinks to \u2018flush your liver\u2019 - can be found with the most casual of online searches, \n(Pelton, 2014). The biomedical explanation is that these ideas stem from misplaced beliefs that \ntoxins in the intestine can enter the circulation and poison the body (Acosta & Cash, 2009; \nRichards et al., 2006). Koteyko and Nerlich see this as a replacement for the fear of infectious \norganisms, which has waned in the age of antibiotics, and substituting \u2018detoxification\u2019 as a \nmeans of \u201cstrengthening the body\u2019s internal armour\u201d (2007: 22). However, this seems a limited \nexplanation for the persistence of the phenomenon and the \u201ccurrent of disgust\u201d (Kj\u00e6r, 2019: \n136) that is associated with the fear of bodily imperfections, and inner \u2018dirt\u2019.  It also misses the \npoint of the symbolism and ritual purification that people appear to be seeking in these practices \nand the need for a physical \u2018thing\u2019 as an enabler.  \nThe spiritual focus to detoxification becomes clear in its association with fasting, a practice long \nassociated with expiation of sin and the search for spiritual cleansing and purity in many forms \nof religion (Brick, 2010; Morinis, 1985). The Jain religion in India shows its most extreme form in \nthat people who have fasted to death are held up as the most advanced examples of holiness \nand spirituality (Laidlaw, 2005). It was clear that Molly\u2019s cleanses were a form of fasting, though \nshe did not refer to them as such; she went to some lengths to emphasise that she took great \ncare that her young son did not realise that she and her husband were going without meals.  \nThey \u201calways, always have a little bit of toast or something like that just so he sees it because \nkids are always watching you.\u201d  This kind of food restriction with \u2018fast days\u2019 is advocated in some \nquarters as an avenue not only to better health, but to the quest for spiritual enlightenment.  \nNash (2006: 310) describes the fasting body as \u201c\u2026an expanded field of energetic confluences\u201d \nthat seeks to overcome the hunger for material food and replaces it with the \u201chunger for pure \nimmanence\u201d that is, the desire to achieve a sense of integrated unity with what lies beyond the \nphysical plane.  \n \n116 \n \n \nAn alternative and more exotic route to spiritual enlightenment in both ancient and modern \ntraditions is the pilgrimage.  Pilgrims in both ancient and modern traditions leave behind their \nnormal lives for a time and travel to a place which is often far away (Barber, 1991; Gesler, 1996; \nRountree, 2006). In this state of \u201climinality\u201d (Gesler, 1996: 96), bracketed between their \ndeparture and return, they are open to healing and transformation, \u201c\u2026 a journey both outward \nto new, strange, dangerous places, and inwards to spiritual improvement, whether through \nincreased self-knowledge or through the braving of physical dangers\u201d (Barber, 1991: 1).   \nOne participant had made a pilgrimage to just such a faraway place, drawn by the idea of \nexperiencing a mysterious substance:    \nI went to Peru to see a shaman. \u2026  I booked myself onto a lodge in the middle of nowhere \nin the Amazon \u2026 just did ayahuasca to see what it was all about.  \u2026 The stories I have \nread is that potentially a serpent will appear and will talk to you.  I didn\u2019t have that.  I \njust had this kind of strange experience where I ended up getting sick.  It\u2019s more of a \ncleansing than anything \u2013 cleansing your body of all these toxins, evil. \u2026it\u2019s referred to in \nthe Amazon as the healing vine maybe more at an emotional level than a physical level, I \ndon\u2019t know.   (Duncan)  \nDuncan\u2019s account had easily recognisable echoes of the hero\u2019s journey (Campbell, 1973) in myth \nand legend, where the protagonist sets out on a strange and potentially dangerous journey to a \nremote place, drawn by the idea of being able to find a \u2018magic\u2019 substance or the \u2018water of life\u2019 \nthat will endow  them with special powers.  Whereas mystics may be able to take the journey \ninwardly without leaving home, pilgrims need a concrete object or place - an exteriorised, \nphysical \u2018thing\u2019 - as a focus for the spiritual experience (Barber, 1991: 3).  It may be a natural \nphenomenon that has special spiritual significance like the river at Benares for Hindus, the grotto \nand spring at Lourdes for Christians seeking healing (Gesler, 1996), or a man-made structure of \nspecial significance like the Neolithic stones at Stonehenge or the Glastonbury Tor that have \nbecome the focus for neo-pagan pilgrimages (Rountree, 2006).  Duncan\u2019s pilgrimage was not \nonly to an outwardly strange (to him) place that was hard to reach, but focused on obtaining an \nexotic \u2018thing\u2019 as an enabler to inward cleansing and healing.  Although he told me that he had \nmade this journey without much thought, his reference to evil and to the deeply ambivalent \nsymbolism of the serpent makes the underlying spiritual meaning of his journey impossible to \noverlook.  According to Mundkur (1983; Mundkur et al., 1976) the cult of the serpent (also \nknown as ophiolatry) can be traced back into distant antiquity and has always excited the human \nimagination, inspiring reverence but also a primeval fear.   Serpents are woven into myths and \n117 \n \n \ndepicted in art from Mesopotamia, to Australia and from Asia to all parts of the Americas.  In the \nGarden of Eden myth of Christian and Jewish tradition, the serpent brings expulsion from \nparadise but also knowledge, underlining its dual appeal as \u201cthe garden of double messages\u201d \n(Slivniak, 2003: 439). Duncan\u2019s comments during our discussion suggested that, in spite of not \nencountering the serpent, he had found the \u2018thing\u2019 unsettling and possibly more than a little \nfrightening, and now saw his youthful confidence as being somewhat misplaced: \nIn hindsight I think I should potentially have been a little more cautious.  \u2026  Looking at it \nnow, yes, I\u2019m glad I did it but I don\u2019t know if I would necessarily recommend it to people.  \n(Duncan) \nSome participants also implied in their comments that they experienced spiritual effects from \nother therapies that they had used to complement their health practices with supplements.  \nWhile these were not the focus of the study, and I did not wish to be drawn into the diverse \nassemblage of therapies described as CAM (complementary and alternative medicine), two \nparticular modalities \u2013 reiki and kinesiology \u2013 stood out for the number of times they were \nmentioned by participants and the mysterious \u2018thing\u2019 power they seemed to create for them.   \nBoth reiki (Miles & True, 2003) and kinesiology (Hamilton, 2011) are therapies that share the \nconcept of energy flows which can be released to relieve physical and emotional pain and \npromote healing.  They both involve a therapist as a conduit, but the \u2018thing\u2019 enabled through the \ntherapist\u2019s touch appears to be something beyond its surface appearance and not something \nthat can be rationally explained. Reiki is of Japanese origin and is said to \u201credistribute stagnant \nenergy\u201d within a person to promote emotional and physical healing (Raingruber & Robinson, \n2007). Kinesiology originated as a muscle testing therapy developed in Sweden by a \nphysiotherapist (Ottosson, 2010).   However, the kinesiology practice that the participants \nreported attending in Christchurch appeared to be an expanded version of applied kinesiology \n(Rosner & Cuthbert, 2012). According to the information on this practice\u2019s website the therapists \nthere have their own technique for \u201cevaluation of physical, emotional, psychological and \nspiritual systems of the body\u201d (Integrated Health, undated). Both reiki and kinesiology resemble \nthe \u2018laying on of hands\u2019 that is used in religious ceremonies to transfer conviction and power to \nthe recipient (Carr, 2000). They also draw on the idea of therapeutic touch that itself forms an \nassemblage encompassing an entanglement of orthodox and alternative healing modalities.  As \nwell as reiki and kinesiology, therapeutic touch and its ally, massage, is found in nursing (Bulette \nCoakley & Duffy, 2010; Hart, 2012), physiotherapy (Weerapong et al., 2005), and M\u0101ori \ntraditional massage (mirimiri) where it is accompanied by karakia (prayer) (Ahuriri-Driscoll et al., \n118 \n \n \n2008). Therapeutic touch has been used to relieve distress and pain in people with cancer \n(Currin & Meister, 2008), to relieve depression (Field et al., 2012), to ease low back pain (Furlan \net al., 2015) and to calm preterm infants (Hernandez-Reif et al., 2007).    \nThe spiritual benefits from the healing touch have been described as \u201ca little understood enigma \nof a signally human interaction\u201d(Krieger, 1975: 784). However, it is the \u2018thing\u2019 beyond \nexplanation in human terms (the enigma), that appears to be the crucial component.  All \nparticipants who commented on reiki and kinesiology struggled to put into words how they \nimagined the therapies created the effects they reported.  Johnny likened reiki to meditation, \nsaying that it reduced his stress and helped him during times when he had chronic sleeping \nproblems but was unable to be more specific.  Duncan had taken a basic training course in reiki \nbut although he reported that \u201c\u2026 you just put your hands on top of [a person] and kind of feel for \nblockers and stoppages\u201d, his explanation served only to underline the mysterious nature of the \neffect.  Participants who talked about kinesiology were equally unable to say what happened in \ntheir treatments.  Jane, Sally, and Rana (who were not known to one another) had all consulted \nthe same kinesiology practice in Christchurch and spoke about their experiences during our \ndiscussions.  I was interested to know more about kinesiology from them as it was a modality I \nwas unfamiliar with.  Each of these participants had sought help for markedly different problems \nand each of them had found it helped them, but none of them was able to pinpoint why.  Jane \nreferred to inflammation in the body that kinesiology had been able to reduce but followed it up \nby saying \u201cto be quite honest, half of it I couldn\u2019t [explain]\u201d.  Sally had found resolution for long \nlasting pain which had not been identified even after a cascade of medical appointments and \ntests.   She mentioned that the kinesiologist pressed her arm down and massaged the site of the \npain in her side, and was \u201ca lovely guy\u2026 a nice guy who is effective\u2026not dodgy stuff either\u201d but \nfollowed it up by saying \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is or what it does.\u201d  Rana, who indicated that her \nproblems were psychological rather than physical distress, was also unable to say in more than \nthe vaguest terms what happened during the treatment:   \nSo he works on  - I don\u2019t know what you call it now \u2013 but uses those oils and things \u2013 \nsprays them into you and the resistance in your joints, so he did that and I noticed a \ndifference almost immediately in my being, in the way I was thinking , in the way I was \nfeeling, I noticed a difference.  (Rana) \nIt is interesting here that they all attempt to explain the effect in physical terms; Jane draws on \nconstructions of inflammation and both Sally and Rana focus on the outward signs; the touch \nand the \u2018oils and things\u2019 and \u2018joint resistance\u2019 in the minimal descriptions they were able to \n119 \n \n \ncome up with, but they hardly provide an explanation of why any of them were able to report \nfeeling so much better.  The intimacy involved in touch therapies certainly requires a degree of \nempathetic rapport between the therapist and the client/patient.  However, there seemed to be \na spiritual \u2018thing\u2019 operating here, which went beyond empathy, an enigma beyond rational \nexplanation which generated effects in those who found the treatment so helpful.   \nIt may seem simplistic or even nonsensical to ascribe the alleviation of bodily and spiritual \u2018dis-\nease\u2019 to a particular substance, whether every-day or exotic, a \u2018cleansing\u2019 drink, or an \nundefinable energy that comes from a particular treatment.  Nevertheless, the participants\u2019 \ndiverse reports showed their conviction that they had drawn energy from whatever \u2018thing\u2019 they \nused and had gained in wellbeing.  Some reported improved biomedical symptoms; others did \nnot, but still found that the \u2018things\u2019 enabled them to cope better with whatever had been \nbothering them.  As one participant pointed out directly, a biomedical cure is not always the way \nto find healing.  She had witnessed a healing ceremony embedded in M\u0101ori traditional medicine \nwhere a family member had their partial vision restored to full sight. This had a profound effect \non her and she was unworried that the sight improvement had been only temporary:   \n\u2026it [the improved sight] didn\u2019t stay, but it gave us enough of a window into a different \nworld of healing.  We were like, O my goodness, there is some really strong energy and \neffective practice going on here that we don\u2019t understand.  So that \u2026   started the \njourney of learning \u2026 (Olivia) \nThe \u2018journey\u2019 referred to by Olivia is an aptly chosen word.  It points ahead to the way that the \nparticipants\u2019 practices with supplements had been an influence for change and development, \nenabling them to move forward in their lives.  So far, this chapter has highlighted only the \nparticipants themselves and their connections with the supplementary and therapeutic \u2018things\u2019 \nthat they engaged in.  Their lives, however, were much richer than this suggests.  Far from being \nfocused on these \u2018things\u2019 for their health, they were \u2018ordinary\u2019 citizens who were well engaged \nsocially and economically across a diverse range of fields.  Drawing from the participants\u2019 \naccounts, the next section looks at the wider context of their lives and traces some of the human \nand non-human components in the network of actants that interacted with the supplement \nthings in the evolving assemblage.    \nThings in the evolving assemblage  \nAll participants were part of the study because they had rich experience with supplements and \nherbal medicines.  So it goes without saying that at the time I spoke to them, this connection had \n120 \n \n \nalready happened at some time in the past, they considered their health practices with \nsupplements to be important, and they were able to speak about their experiences at some \nlength.  When discussing with them how they first started to take supplements, I could see that \nan apparently simple decision to start using a particular product was the result of a long chain of \nevents within a network of many connections, some deliberate and others quite random.  While \nthe immediate situations that precipitated the action may have been a health problem of some \nkind, it was far from a simple connection.  Entangled in the decision were their own views about \nhealth and illness that came from their cultural background and life experiences, examples of \nfamilies, friends and acquaintances who also took supplements, wider social discourses of health \nand illness, heterogeneous pieces of information from many different kinds of commercial, \nhealth, and social media, and previous contacts with the orthodox health system.  All these came \ntogether at a node in the network when each participant made the decision to take action.  They \nbought and took a particular product which then became ingested matter and part of their \nbeing.   Moreover, the chain of events did not terminate at that point, but went on to inform \nsubsequent decisions and produce new connections which led to further actions.   \nDeleuze and Guattari\u2019s (1987) rhizome again helps to conceptualise the tangled relationships \nwithin such an assemblage. While it is the synthesis between the connections and interactions of \nthe rhizome which creates the forward movement, it is still useful to look at several of the \nindividual actants in more detail to elucidate the range of personal, social, and economic factors \nthat were apparent across the data generated in the study.  Of course, a single interview of \naround an hour could not expect to reveal the multitude of connecting points that had come \ntogether for each of the participants and set off their engagement with supplements.  \nNevertheless it was possible to distinguish several broader categories that had been influential \nfor all of them, and to trace the connecting threads between the vital matter of the supplements \nand how they were linked to previous experiences in their lives, contacts with other people that \nhad been influential, and wider social and economic discourses that they had come across.   \nIt was clear from the discussions with the participants that many of them assumed it was both \nobvious and sensible to find things to treat themselves with whenever possible, and to only \nconsult a health professional as a back-up approach if they needed more than they could do \nalone.  This self-sufficient attitude appeared to be derived from their family and the wider \ncultural milieu in which they had grown up.  It echoed constructions of the \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 (DIY) \nNew Zealander which places a high value on being a \u201cKiwi bloke\u201d (Cox, 2016) who takes pride in \nbeing able to bring together their own materials and skills and solve most problems \n121 \n \n \nindependently. This was even more pronounced in those participants who lived or had lived in \nrural areas, where self-sufficiency and independence is assumed to be part of the ethos of small \ncommunities (Herbert-Cheshire, 2000; Powell et al., 2016; Swaffield & Fairweather, 1998):    \nWe were farmers so we had our own orchard \u2026.  But I think cod liver oil and Vicks were \nthe staple things that my mother had in her first aid bag\u2026. Whenever we went to the \nsea, my mother would go, just go and put it in the sea, salt water was very healing. \n(Caro) \nThis type of embodied cultural capital that Caro articulated and which forms people\u2019s \nassumptions is accumulated, largely unconsciously, over a lifetime, strongly affecting people\u2019s \nideas and beliefs (Calhoun et al., 1993). This is Bourdieu\u2019s notion of the habitus.  A person\u2019s \nhabitus results in actions that are \u201cneither fully determined nor fully willed\u201d (McNay 1999: 100) \nbut played out in what Bourdieu termed \u201cle sens pratique\u201d generally translated as \u2018the rules of \nthe game\u2019 (King 2000; McNay 1999). This means that the response to particular circumstances is \nvariable and creative within the bounds of what an individual finds to be reasonable behaviour \nfor their family, group or social class (Garnham and Williams 1980: 213). Individuals become \nskilled at the game, evolving beyond its original limitations and (using an analogy with tennis), \ndevelop \u201c\u2026 the practical flexibility to know when they should run to the net or into space\u201d (King \n2000: 419).   \nThe comments made by participants like Caro and others tended to focus on the household \nitems and patent medicines from which they had acquired their \u2018sense of the game\u2019 and formed \ntheir independent attitude towards looking after themselves in most circumstances:  \nOk, you\u2019ve got some sunburn, let\u2019s get out some \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 and put that on.  \nRawleighs [a patent medicine company] I guess was really big then as well, so that\u2019s \nwhat you would do.  You get a cold, so you get the Vicks Vaporub\u2122 [mentholated cough \nand cold remedy] on.  My older brother used to get croup quite bad so they would get all \nthe stuff they needed to and get the old preserving thing out and make lots of steam \nwith it and have it in a tent sort of. (Johnny) \nHere Johnny looks back to his childhood and describes the material things that had been \nmeaningful to him as simple DIY remedies.  His description shows that he had observed the \nadults in his life interacting with them had provided the template for how he went about \nmanaging his minor health problems now although the \u2018things\u2019 themselves had moved on.  The \npatent remedies he mentioned in his early years had mostly evolved over time, becoming more \n122 \n \n \nelaborate and less likely to be common household ingredients, but the underlying concept of \npractical independence using simple material products and applying learned skills had not.  \nJohnny now said he took multivitamins, omega-3 tablets, magnesium, and sleepy tea if he was \nhaving \u201ca few sleep issues\u201d.  Several of the participants who had immigrated to New Zealand \nfrom different European countries continued with the alternative products they had been \nprescribed by doctors there but had learned to be self-reliant and seek them out independently \nbecause they were not available in the standard health system in New Zealand.  Similarly, \nparticipants who had knowledge of M\u0101ori traditional medicine from their childhood were also \ncontinuing to use adapted forms that fitted around their current circumstances.  All of them \nwere using their \u2018sense of the game\u2019 to adapt and change in a flexible way, making use of what \nworked for them at the time I met them. Each had their unique assemblage of actants around \ntheir health practices to which their habitus from the past had clearly contributed the \u2018codes\u2019 of \nthe assemblage.  However, it was constantly changing and evolving with the material things \nbeing, adapted, or woven in with new ideas and discourses as time moved on and they \nthemselves were changed.   \nRather than simply adapting the codes of the assemblage as times changed, some participants \nrelated stories of a dramatic departure from their normal practices that sparked radical change, \nas  \u2018lines of flight\u2019 from the usual actants in the rhizomatic assemblage.  These transformation \nstories consistently combined elements of a crisis and a material \u2018thing\u2019 which resulted from it, \nas Derrida would say \u201csomething absolutely new and a break\u201d (Derrida 1997:6):    \n\u2026my father was very, very, very ill and the priest came to basically give him the last rites \nand his father said\u2026  I\u2019m going to this friend of mine who\u2019s got homeopathic stuff, came \nback, gave it to my father and from that point the fever broke.  They firmly believed it \nwas related to the homeopathic medicine and from that point forward Dad always, his \nparents, always used that in conjunction with mainstream medicine.  So it has been part \nof our culture, our family culture for a long time and our family continues as a whole to \nuse alternative medicine in different forms. (Trudy)  \nTrudy draws attention to this as a seminal event marking a crucial watershed in her family\u2019s \nhistory which she designates as a moment of change \u201cfrom that point forward\u201d.  However, as \nthe events took place when her father was a child, and therefore before her own lifetime, it \nappears it had created a new assemblage around homeopathic \u2018things\u2019 which had become part \nof her own cultural habitus.  She went on to note that, as a child, she found her family\u2019s habitus \nsomewhat difficult; her European immigrant family was \u2018different\u2019 from the accepted norm, not \n123 \n \n \njust in their use of homeopathy but the things they ate, which marked her out as unusual, \nespecially at school where she was often \u201creeking of garlic\u201d.  Her family experiences, however, \nhad been a stronger influence on her subsequent attitudes and practices than the opinions of \noutsiders and according to her comments, it had strongly influenced her throughout her adult \nlife.   \nFor another participant the \u2018rupture\u2019 was also a \u2018line of flight\u2019 that took place in a crisis.  A crucial \nmoment of decision, in her case, was at a point when she rejected taking a \u2018thing\u2019 she believed \nwould have intolerable effects:  \n..[the doctor] said, well go to the pain specialist and see what he says but I think he will \nwant to put you on morphine.  I said, well I am not going.  \u2026  I thought well if I\u2019m only \ngoing to be told I\u2019ve got to go on morphine I\u2019m not going to take it so I will try other \nthings.  So I tried reflexology, [name of therapist] for the kinesiology and chiropractic, \nand of course I had to give up walking.  I could hardly get out of bed at times.  I did push \nmyself and go swimming and all that but I found the omega-3 and those people with \nreflexology and kinesiology \u2013 my back\u2019s not any different \u2013 I haven\u2019t done anything \u2013 I \nhaven\u2019t had an operation, but I do not take one thing.  I don\u2019t even take a Panadol for it.  \n(Jane) \nHere the things Jane ended up using appear to have been of lesser importance than the thing \nshe was avoiding.  Rather than the positive agency that Trudy attributed to the homeopathic \nmedicines in her family crisis, it was the negative agency of the morphine that was the turning \npoint for Jane.   She does not say why she was so determined not to take the morphine, and it \nappeared to be something within her own assemblage of cultural and background assumptions.   \nThese two accounts were each examples of the way that both positive and negative \u2018thing \npower\u2019 had agency that could be seen to generate effects for the participants, acting as a \ncatalyst that was mobilised at a time of crisis in their lives.     \nInterconnecting things  \nNaturally, in the course of their everyday lives, participants came across the ideas and stories \nabout supplements in their interactions with other people within and beyond their own circle of \nfriends and acquaintances and reciprocated with their own experiences.  So supplements were a \ntopic of discourse in their lives, \u2018things\u2019 that started conversations with others.  It was apparent \nfrom the participants\u2019 accounts that personal recommendations, especially those made face-to-\nface, were a powerful way of disseminating information about supplements and encouraging \n124 \n \n \nothers to adopt them. They gave numerous examples of ideas that they had heard from their \nfamily members or other people they came into contact with through shared activities.  Hearing \nrecommendations for products from people in their own network appeared to set up a \nbackground of common social capital between them and the participants which reinforced the \ntrustworthiness and salience of the advice.  Trudy had started taking fish oil on the \nrecommendation of a friend:  \n\u2026 a friend of mine had been telling me about fish oil  \u2026.  I looked up online because I \nalways like to know and there didn\u2019t seem to be any negative side effects as such, not \nany serious ones,  and most of what I could see it was actually quite beneficial so I \nthought, yes, I\u2019ll start taking it.  (Trudy) \nRana, had confided in a work colleague about an emotionally stressful time she was going \nthrough and her thoughts about needing to see a doctor for antidepressants.  The colleague \nrecommended instead that she consult a kinesiologist first and see if it helped.  Rana acted on \nthe advice in spite of her initial skepticism, and found it so helpful that she had since encouraged \nthree others in her family network to do the same. The advice does not necessarily need to \ncome from someone well known to the recipient; it can be important and influential from a \nmere acquaintance if that person is knowledgeable in an area that is of mutual interest.  Sally \nheard about cranberry for preventing urinary tract infections through the rest home where her \nmother lived: \nIt\u2019s pretty amazing stuff\u2026(indicating the cranberry) I just hate having urinary tract \ninfections.  Having to go to the jolly doctor \u2013 [being given] the same old things \u2026 But I \ndon\u2019t need it now. (Sally) \nSimilarly, Bob heard about his supplements from passing acquaintances that he met through \ndifferent social activities.  In all cases the advice was also timely, coming along at a time when \nthese participants were grappling with a specific problem and open to hearing about \u2018things\u2019 \nthat might resolve it.   The intersection of the problem to be solved coinciding with the right \nperson offering advice at the right time seemed to be a trigger to act on the advice and take up \nthe \u2018thing\u2019 suggested, particularly as it was readily available from any number of easily accessed \nsources.  Personal recommendations like this tap into the cultural meanings that the endorser \nbrings to the product (Biswas et al., 2006; McCracken, 1989), giving rise to emotional, cognitive \nand behavioural responses in the recipient that make the advice trustworthy and personally \nrelevant (Lewis and Weigert, 1985).   \n125 \n \n \nThe personalisation of the advice appears to hold true even if the recommender is not \npersonally known, but familiar through exposure in the media, or if their credentials are \nmeaningful to the person viewing or hearing the advice (Briggs et al., 2002).  Celebrity and \nexpert endorsements work in the same way as personal recommendations because they are \neasily recognised by diverse members of the public who admire their achievements (Walseth, \n2008). Murray, for example, was eager to point out to me that the brand of supplements he \nused were also used by well-known elite sports people:   \n \u2026they [the company] sponsor the Women\u2019s Tennis Association, 16 of the top 20 women\u2019s \ntennis players are on [product brand name] and seven of the top ten. (Murray)    \nMurray was a former tennis player himself, and the endorsement of these famous tennis players \nwho were familiar to him through the media seemed to be in the same category as if it had \ncome from someone he knew well.  His respect for these players, based on his knowledge of \ntheir sporting prowess, translated into an affirmation for him that he was taking the right \nproducts, even though he was never likely to meet any of these people face-to-face or have a \nconversation with them.     \nAs well as personal contacts, the rhizomatic assemblage connects human actants through the \npopular and  scientific media with an enormous variety of ideas about things that may help or \nharm (for example, (Berg\u00e9 et al., 2013; Crighton et al., 2013; Hatch et al., 2010; Meeker, 2012; \nNicolopoulou-Stamati et al., 2015). The perceptions of risk these give rise to were discussed in \ndetail in the previous chapter.  However, it is worth drawing attention to these discourses of \nharmful/helpful things from another angle, that is, to highlight the constant presence of the \n\u2018thing\u2019 that one either must use or must avoid for their health\u2019s sake, which is never far from the \nheadlines.   Against this background, the actual \u2019thing\u2019 that is the object of interest comes and \ngoes over time.  Bernie, for example, talked about the changes he had seen in the years that he \nhad been in his shop: \nSixteen years ago it used to be multivitamins, Vitamin C and treatments for a bit of \ncongestion but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve sold a multivitamin now for months.  Now it is people \ncoming in looking for answers that they\u2019re not getting elsewhere.  That would be for \nthings like rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, eczema, ankylosing spondylitis, MS, cancer, a \nwhole variety of illnesses.  (Bernie)  \nA particular \u2018thing\u2019 may become the object of attention in the media that creates a flurry of \ninterest and/or concern only to be replaced by something else a few days or weeks later.   Very \n126 \n \n \noften the media items are based on research studies but the limited framings of science \njournalism create a cycle which oscillates back and forth \u201cfrom Gee whiz to Shock Horror\u201d (Reed, \n2002: 43), omitting the important caveats and nuances that the original study may well have \npresented.  Over the last several years in the Christchurch area, concerns about various bad \n\u2018things\u2019 have come and gone in just such a cycle; studies about the weed killer glyphosphate \n(Roundup) and the migration of the plastics in food packaging and storage containers into foods \n(Chang et al., 2014; Guart et al., 2011; Mink et al., 2011; Portier et al., 2016) became headlines in \npopular and local media during 2018 (Anonymous, 2018b; Hutching, 2018). By 2019 these \nappeared to be fading and being replaced by concerns about nitrates in drinking water (Clague \net al., 2015; Foote et al., 2015) and the effects of climate change exposing old and still toxic \nlandfills (Brand et al., 2018; Northcott, 2019). Though the \u2018gee whiz\u2019 (\u2018amazing thing\u2019) headline is \nalso popular, for example, reports of break through discoveries in cancer or dementia, that hold \nout hope for a cure where none was previously available (Clopton, 2019; Haridy, 2018), the \n\u2018shock horror\u2019 stories about \u2018bad things\u2019 tend to be more powerful. Bad news is held to engage \nmore people and to sell better, leading to the belief that the popular media are generally biased \ntowards highlighting the negative aspects of any issue (not just health) and that the general \npublic also has an asymmetric response that is drawn to reports about bad things rather than \ngood (Arango-Kure et al., 2014; Garz, 2014; Soroka, 2006).    \nThe concept of bad things was aligned to, but different from the social discourses discussed in \nthe previous chapter when participants had been personally affected by a specific bad thing.  \nThe bad things that were reported in the media then seemed to act as a reinforcement of their \npersonal experiences. Charles was one participant who held very strong views about prescribed \nmedicines as being \u2018bad things.\u2019 He gave an account of a life-threatening adverse drug reaction \nwhere he had ended up in intensive care for a lengthy period.  He had been intensely disturbed \nby this event, and, had lost trust in doctors and prescribed medicines.  He indicated that other \naccounts he had read or heard about since had led him to believe that his experiences were \nwidespread and applied much more widely to \u2018people\u2019 in general who, like him, were using \nsupplements instead:  \n\u2026 why are people turning to these things?  The thing is that they are getting so hacked \noff what they get from the medical world.  They are not getting the results they expect; \nsome of the stuff they are being given is so discomforting that it drives them demented.   \n(Charles) \n127 \n \n \nAnother participant, Wendy, reported that her husband had a similar intense dislike of \nprescribed medicines which he believed were harmful things promoted by drug companies for \ntheir own profit.  He would go to great lengths to avoid them:      \nMy husband absolutely hates pharmaceuticals.  He thinks it\u2019s a racket\u2026 he got a really \nhorrendous chest infection \u2026   that morning I was thinking O my God, I am going to have \nto take him to A&E.  But Mister had been upstairs on the internet and he had read these \nthings about silver, so being ready to try anything \u2026 he went and found his silver ring and \nhe went and grated it and put it into hot water and then inhaled it.  \u2026. within 24 hours \nmost of those crackles had subsided and by 72 hours he was practically back to normal.  \n(Wendy) \nThis somewhat unusual reaction was not typical of the majority of participants, most of whom \ncomfortably combined prescribed medicines with their supplements.  Nevertheless, the \u2018harmful \nthing\u2019 headline appears to have much capacity to cause confirmation bias (Montibeller & von \nWinterfeldt, 2015) for those who are looking for it.  There are plentiful reports of adverse \nreactions to prescribed drugs that can be found on even the most casual of searches (for \nexample, (Bellosta & Corsini, 2012; Hoffelt & Gross, 2016; Perucca & Gilliam, 2012), as well as \nitems in both the academic and popular media that show the pharmaceutical industry in a poor \nlight (Davis & Abraham, 2013; MacDonald, 2018). \nThe channels of communication that spread the discourses about the good or bad things are an \nadditional category of non-human actants with their own agency that are an integral part of the \nassemblage of supplement things.  People use them to access information and opinion, solicit \nadvice, buy products, and connect with one another through a vast network of modern and \ntraditional communication tools that are available across the globe in real time and are \nconstantly changing and evolving.  They link across the globe, connecting things with people who \nmay seek them out deliberately or come across them by chance.  These communication things, \nwhich form immense rhizomatic assemblages in their own right, enable people to have \nconvenient access any time of the day or night to the vast pool of resources that is the world of \nthe modern internet (Siliquini et al., 2011; Suziedelyte, 2012; Tustin, 2010). Moreover, the \nelectronic things through which consumers connect with this assemblage of information \ncontinue to evolve in their ease of use, their connection speed and the amount of information \nthey can hold.  Even the cheapest devices - the mobile phones, tablets, computers \u2013 are now \nable to connect to online databases of vast capacity (Maggiani, 2009). These tools have not \ncompletely replaced older media formats such as radio and print but they have greatly enhanced \n128 \n \n \nthe ability of anyone with an internet-enabled device to connect more often and more widely to \nan immense pool of information.  They can find out what products are available anywhere in the \nworld and buy them, given that they have the financial resources, all without leaving home.  \nMoreover, individuals such as the participants are not just passively waiting for reports of things \nthat help or harm to come to them.  They are also testing their own ideas and searching for new \nones, and adding their own pieces of information to the mix, so that the evolving assemblage of \ninformation about these things is always in process.   \nAlmost all participants mentioned using a variety of communication channels to search for, find, \nand follow up supplement products.  They might search online to cross check their own ideas or \nadvice they had received in person or read about in a magazine to discover whether it tallied \nwith what they found online.  Alternatively they might follow a link from something they found \nonline and then seek further online and in-person advice from another source they considered \nreliable.  Paul was a particularly adept user of all sorts of communication modes as his story of \nbee pollen shows:  \nI started taking bee pollen \u2026 I heard about bee pollen because I was listening to Radio \nPacific\u2026.   allegedly it boosted your immune system and gave you energy. \u2026  I guess \ninitially I felt that I was getting a boost specially if I felt that I was getting run down or a \ncold I would up the intake of it for a while and feel a little better   (Paul) \nAs Paul indicated, he was not searching deliberately for a supplement here but came across the \ninformation incidentally when listening to the radio. However, he then used his online resources \nto find a source of supply and order the pollen, firstly for himself, and then in bulk.  For a while \nhe and his wife would fill gelatin capsules by hand and sell them as a sideline to the online \nsection of their gardening business or at garden shows they attended. Although it was time-\nconsuming, they did well enough out of it, he said, at a time when the product was little known.  \nThe communication actants involved in this small part of the complex network covered both the \nold (radio) and new (online) communication tools which were variously used to learn \ninformation, obtain the \u2018thing\u2019 (the pollen) and then to market and sell it online through his \nbusiness connections.  In turn the communication things were part of a wider web of human \nactants and social discourses which focused on a particular thing, bee pollen.        \nOther participants, like Cliff, had developed proficiency in searching the internet as a direct \nresult of wanting to learn more about supplements and obtain them:  \n129 \n \n \nI only got computer literate about two years ago \u2013 I\u2019m a total newbie in all those, \nYoutube all that sort of stuff.  But if you use it right you can get information and also I \nbuy most of my herbs from I-Herb now in America \u2013 I can go on their research sites. (Cliff) \nBy the time I spoke to Cliff, he was an adept internet user who described a range of products he \nhad bought to try out for himself and recommended websites that he thought I should look at to \nhelp with the study. He pointed out that supplements can be ordered from anywhere with the \nclick of a mouse and a credit card and are often cheaper than in a local store. In addition, the \nnon-human devices and websites that enable users to make these transactions never get tired, \nstop work or go on holiday as a human would, so can be used any time of the day or night in any \npart of the world.  Once the buyer initiates the order, the entire subsequent chain of reaction is \nhandled through technological things, acknowledging the order, charging the credit card, then \nthe packing, dispatching and delivery.  Although there are humans involved along the way, the \npersonal interaction between buyer and seller is replaced with the non-human devices, software \nand connections.  Walk-in stores promote the personal service and advice they can offer, but \nonce a person is confident about what they need, the appeal and convenience of online \nshopping seems hard to resist.  Sally described what she liked about the online system:   \nAnd they\u2019ve [the local health shop] been very good \u2026 until I thought, well I\u2019ll go on the \ninternet and it\u2019s brilliant, absolutely brilliant.  Order it and I get it the next morning.  It\u2019s \ncouriered.  It\u2019s absolutely amazing.  They tell me exactly when they have packaged it.  It\u2019s \njust a two second operation now that I know how to use the thing.  (Sally) \nIt is interesting to note that Sally encapsulates this whole process and underlines its anonymity \nin describing it as \u201cknowing how to use the thing\u201d.   Her \u2018sense of the game\u2019 shows how she has \nunderstood that buying things can be adapted from the walk-in shop to use other actants in the \nassemblage that are now at her disposal.  She already knows what \u2018things\u2019 she needs, she uses \nher skills with modern communication things to find an online source where she can buy her \nproducts more conveniently - no need to go out to visit the store - and even more cheaply, \nbecomes familiar with how it works, places orders, and receives messages in return, with the \nresult that the package of supplements lands on her doorstep the next morning.   \nThe agency of the material things drives these transactions in a way that humans may use but \nover which they have only limited control.  People bring various levels of skill to seek what they \nwant but what they find is largely determined by the non-human things that are unseen but lie \nbehind the user interface: the systems on which the search engines run, the algorithms that \n130 \n \n \ndetermine what they see, and the capacity and speed of the internet connections and the \nphones or laptops which the human users employ as tools. Most participants appeared to be \naware of both the advantages and limitations of these technical things and would cross check \nwhat they found from several angles and compare prices and sources of supply.  They were also \ncontinuing to develop expertise in interpreting what they found and recognising which were the \nmore reliable sources of information and which were simply driven by marketing and promotion \nof particular products.  This last point leads on to the economic and commercial actants that are \ndeeply entangled in the sources that generate the information about supplements things.  They \ninclude the products themselves, the companies that develop and market them (and their share-\nholders), the buyers and sellers and the channels through which they are disseminated.   The \nnext section tackles the implications of these actants, the levers of supply and demand, and how \nthey were manifested in the data generated in the discussions with the participants.   \nMarketing things \nUndoubtedly, commercial interests have played a part in the increasing use and availability of \nsupplements and herbal products across all developed countries in recent decades (McCann, \n2005; Van Buul & Brouns, 2015). There is much money invested in their manufacture and \nmarketing (Persistence Market Research, 2017), with companies from large corporates to small \nindependent businesses always aiming for new ways to attract new customers, and retain them \nby providing a point of difference from other similar products (Sosna et al., 2010; Suleria et al., \n2015). The underlying demand, however, does not appear to be driven only by the pull of \nadvertising but the push from consumers who are searching for new products and new ways of \nmanaging their health (Khedkar et al., 2017; Shepherd & Bachis, 2014; Wrick, 1995). Whether \npush or pull, the marketing revolves around \u2018things\u2019 to sell backed up by discourses and images \nto encourage buyers and communication channels to disseminate the message widely.  The \n\u2018things\u2019 themselves may not necessarily be new, but older products that have been reimagined \nand repackaged to appeal to the contemporary consumer by combining, formatting or naming \nthem differently.  Cod liver oil once spooned out of a bottle to previous generations of children \nhas become the more scientific sounding omega-3 fish oil in easy-to-swallow capsules now \npromoted as having benefits for people of any age.  Garlic, already familiar from its use in \neveryday recipes or herbal remedies for generations, has been reformulated into tablets that \navoid the mess and smell of the natural product and combined with other herbs and vitamins as \nan immunity booster (Percival, 2016; Ried, 2016; Totelin, 2015). As discussed in the previous \nchapter, traditional medicines from other societies that are new and exotic to western \n131 \n \n \nconsumers have also become increasingly incorporated into mainstream ranges in health stores \nand pharmacies (Connell, 2006; Loyer & Knight, 2018; May, 1996).    \nWith the market for supplements well established, but highly competitive, participants who sold \nsupplements and herbal products were keenly aware of the pressure on their business to remain \nviable by keeping abreast of current trends. They described a constantly moving scene at the \npoint of sale, with new products, combinations, and formulations constantly vying for the \nattention of customers, who, it seems have a constant demand for novelty (Gallagher, 2012).  \nThey talked about the need to find a balance between anticipating or responding rapidly to \nconsumer demands for new things, and being wary of investing too much in any particular one \nthing, as consumer demand was volatile, with interest prone to flare and then wane just as \nquickly:  \nThere tend to be trends \u2013 definitely trends as to what is the \u2018in product\u2019 \u2026 for instance \nturmeric is quite big at the moment so everybody comes out with their turmeric \u2026things \nlike R3 was on the radio for ages and ages.  We couldn\u2019t get it.  We didn\u2019t know who \nsupplied it.  Huge demand for it.  As soon as we got it, it started to back off a little bit. \n\u2026it\u2019s not sold so we put it out on special and wait for the next trend. (Kerry)  \nRarely, it appeared, a small businessman like Paul, might see a trend coming and capitalise on it \nearly before others caught up.  However, the market was always changing and there appeared \nto be a small window of time before, as Paul found out, \u201cpeople were able to find it in health \nshops and in supermarkets and that sort of thing and our market slowly dried up.\u201d    \nMarketing makes good use of communication channels which underpin much of the waxing and \nwaning of trends.   Online marketing in particular has a wide reach as it spans geographical \ndistance in a way that other marketing tools cannot.  Moreover, online advertising makes use of \nadvanced technological algorithms to remember what people have searched for and \nautomatically display similar but related products that are likely to appeal to them (Alag\u00f6z et al., \n2010). However, marketing alone cannot make the promotion successful; if consumers do not \nfind some advantage in a particular product, then it is likely to fade away, just as Kerry describes \nabove.  Although almost all the participants talked about their use of online sources, more \ntraditional marketing was still a powerful influence on their purchases.  Radio has already been \nmentioned by both Paul and Kerry as connecting potential users with a supplement of interest \nand many others mentioned reading about products in a magazine or other print publication.  \nOne retailer participant advertised his products and services in a full page advertisement in a \n132 \n \n \nlocal newspaper every two weeks and local pharmacy chains promoted their \u2018specials\u2019 in print \npublications in their stores, as well as online.  A health store chain continued to publish a \nsubstantial free magazine every month, with products and advice focusing on a particular theme \neach time, for example, sleep, stress, immunity or surviving winter illnesses.  These magazines \nprovided a rich source of informal data over the course of the study about the mix of typical \ncommunication and marketing actants that are used to appeal to the widest possible range of \npotential customers. While they clearly had human input into their design, they stood out as \nusing the material form to connect with discourses that would maximise the appeal of the things \nthey were promoting.  \nWell-chosen images are powerful actants that create positive associations with the things they \nare promoting (Roininen et al., 2006). In these magazines, images of glossy leaves, luscious-\nlooking fruits and berries, scenic landscapes and happy, smiling families accompanied by bland \ndescriptions of products as \u2018healthy\u2019, \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018good for you\u2019 appeared to confirm the \nwisdom of the old adage that \u2018a picture is worth a thousand words\u2019.  Supplement users were \ndepicted as young, good looking, often in exercise gear, jumping for joy and full of \u2018get up and \ngo\u2019. Personalised testimonials complete with signatures and photographs of satisfied users, \nordinary citizens, or locally well-known sports or media personalities also featured, adding \nauthentication and conviction to the marketing message (Koteyko & Nerlich, 2007). Older \npeople, a key market for many of the products because of their concerns about aching joints, \nprostate problems, heart disease, and dementia, were not often depicted, but when they were, \nthey also appeared in full health, engaging in active outdoor pursuits.  \nSupplements in these sort of media are constructed as things with the power and agency to \ncreate desirable effects in people\u2019s lives through strategic combinations of linguistics and \nimages.  The healthy and active \u2018lifestylism\u2019 they promote (Koteyko and Nerlich,  2007) is \ncommonly reinforced by the imperative voice, seeming to speak directly to the reader in a \npersonal way and instruct them to be active participants in making themselves healthy, for \nexample the exhortation to  \u201cJump start your exercise mojo!!\u201c (Dobson, 2016).  There is a \nrelentless positivity about almost all the language used to communicate and market the benefits \nof supplement things to users in these publications (see Figure 2).  They \u2018cleanse\u2019, \u2018balance\u2019, \n\u2018renew\u2019, \u2018boost\u2019 and \u2018soothe\u2019; they improve immunity, give \u2018kids calm\u2019 and provide \u2018tranquil \nsleep\u2019.  Most frequently they \u2018support\u2019: in a single issue of the one magazine I examined, various \nproducts were said to  \u2018support\u2019 menopause, sleep, stamina, healthy cartilage, joint comfort and \nmobility, the prostate, digestive balance, the body\u2019s response to allergens, and to give extra \n133 \n \n \nsupport that would \u2018lift brain power\u2019.  The framing of supplements like this serves several \npurposes; it conveys overwhelmingly positive associations; it chooses language that is open to \nbeing applied and interpreted in any way; and, importantly, it constructs the products as distinct \nfrom the therapeutic claims associated with pharmaceuticals.  This last contrast is a useful one; \nnot only does it construct supplements as being for wellness rather than illness (in contrast to \nprescribed medicines) but it is able to make a virtue out of the necessity of complying with \nregulatory regimes in most developed countries that prohibit supplement marketing from \nclaiming to treat or cure a health condition (Crawford & Leventis, 2005).    \n \nFigure 2: Marketing things: graphic by Alex Bidwell, used with permission \nParticipants were clearly aware of and entangled with the assemblage of marketing actants as \nalmost all of them commented about them in some way.  Most indicated that they believed they \ncould distinguish between genuine information and unrealistic marketing promises and few \nwould admit to being swayed by advertising.  Tessa, however, confessed that she had \nsometimes felt foolish for believing claims she had read in product promotions:     \nI get a bit enthusiastic, excited when I see something online about a new product, or \nsomething that\u2019s going to have an effect on my brain functioning and all that kind of \nstuff and improve my memory and make me feel really fantastic.  \u2026.  So I do have to be \ncareful because I am a bit \u2013 because I can make decisions a bit too quickly. (Tessa)  \nThere is also an awareness among marketers and advertisers, however, that they need to attract \nthose users who are sceptical of promotional discourses and images, but can be reached through \ntheir sensitivity to price.  Price was definitely a major consideration for many of the participants \n134 \n \n \nwho were frank about how costly they found supplements.  Most of them knew the exact price \nthey paid for a particular product and how it compared to other brands or sources of supply.  \nIris, Marama, and Caro all referred to items they would never buy because of the price; Trudy \ndescribed changing from a pharmacy product to a cheaper supermarket generic brand, and Sally \nand Cliff now both bought primarily from online outlets because they could save money.  Even \nthose who seemed not to worry about the absolute cost, were keen to ensure that if they did \nspend more than the cheapest price, it should be money well spent.  As Penny remarked \n\u201csometimes they are quite expensive and you don\u2019t actually want to spend that money if you \ndon\u2019t think it is actually going to work.\u201d   There is a different set of marketing actants that come \ninto play around price; discounts, \u2018two for one deals\u2019, loyalty cards, or \u2018free gift with purchase\u2019 \noffers.  Additionally, \u2018price plus advice\u2019 combinations do seem to attract regular customers who \njust want their usual product rather than looking for novelty.  Several participants reported that \nthey always went to the same store, even if it meant travelling out of their way because they got \nregular discounts for their loyalty and also felt they were given good advice.  Companies use \nthese sorts of drawcards to build a \u2018brand community\u2019 (Gommans et al., 2001; Hur et al., 2011; \nMcAlexander et al., 2002) that creates a link:  \n\u2026between the customer and the brand, the customer and the firm, the customer and \nthe product in use, and between fellow customers (McAlexander et al 2002: 38)  \nThis so-called \u2018community\u2019 is itself an evolving assemblage built around a set of human and non-\nhuman actants connected in a network of shifting interactions.  Online outlets cannot provide \nface-to\u2013face advice but offset this by being able to generate \u2018e-loyalty\u2019 (Gommans, 2001), \nconnecting users via their website without being bounded by time zones or geographical \ndistance, and encouraging interactive customer-to-customer comments. Additionally, a \ncompany \u2018expert\u2019 may offer advice through their website.  A participant who regularly bought \nproducts online from the same outlet reported her experience of requesting their advice:    \nI\u2019ve just swapped to this one here [indicating new product] \u2026my arthritis seemed to be \njust getting worse.  \u2026 So I just actually typed on the helpline and told them my situation \n\u2026 and I pretty well got an instant reply.  And they said, you know, probably the arthritis is \ngetting worse because there is no difference in the ingredients.  Anyway, it didn\u2019t really \nhelp but it\u2019s much better. (Sally) \nThe experience Sally reports here serves to underline the complex entanglement of \u2018things\u2019 in \nthe assemblage around the material substances of the supplements; the technical connection \n135 \n \n \nthrough the online help service provided by the product retailer and the prompt communication \nof information in a personal (though disembodied) response.   Although the advice appeared to \nchange nothing for her physical problem, Sally appeared reassured, confident she was coping \nwith her condition, felt better anyway and was overall a satisfied customer who was likely to \nkeep using the same outlet for her supplies.  \nA number of participants in the study were engaged in network marketing, a differently \norganised set of similar actants connected together in their own rhizomatic assemblage around a \nspecific set of supplement things.  These participants were a relatively small group within the \nstudy, but the data generated from the discussions with them are worth examining in some \ndetail because of the intensity of their engagement with their \u2018things\u2019.  Network marketing \ndiffers from everyday transactions where people buy things from a range of stores or other \noutlets that sell to the general public; the \u2018things\u2019 are familiar but they are differently organised \nand sold.  The network marketing model is focused around material products and familiar \ndiscourses but mobilised through economic enticements, entrepreneurial discourses, personal \nrelationships and the transformation narratives of company heroes.  Products are sold through a \nnetwork of distributors, who sell directly to friends and contacts but are also urged to recruit \nthese contacts and anyone else in their networks to become distributors themselves (Kong, \n2001). The emphasis on making money by selling through personal contacts is a key feature \ndifferentiating network marketing from other marketing strategies.    Distributors generally \nreceive commissions and bonuses on both the amount of product they sell, and the successful \nrecruitment of others as salespersons (Keep & Vander Nat, 2014; Kong, 2001). Supplements \nhave been a key product in network marketing right from the beginning; during the 1940s, an \nAmerican supplement manufacturing company was the first to use this model of sales (Keep & \nVander Nat, 2014; Kong, 2001; Msweli & Sargeant, 2001) and supplements have continued to be \na mainstay of this mode of selling.   \nDuring the course of the study I heard from participants about a number of different network \nmarketing companies that they had been, or were currently, involved with.  Their accounts \nprovided a clear picture of the various strategies that were used to attract users. One of these \ndrew on the same social discourses of harmful things that have already been described in the \nprevious chapter, as Clara\u2019s experience showed:  \nHe [the presenter] talked about the nutrition that is not in our food any more, it is all \nprocessed out.  The foundation food for health is gone, essential fatty acids, is gone, for \nshelf life. (Clara) \n136 \n \n \nThis is not a new strategy; Cardwell (1998) noted more than 20 years ago that network \nmarketing recruits are commonly exposed to an identical scenario, which portrays the food \nsupply as deficient in essential nutrients, and that all health problems are related to these \ndeficiencies, but they can be remedied by taking the particular company\u2019s products on offer. \nThere was a two-way entry into network marketing it seemed.  Some participants, like Clara, had \nused the products and had begun selling them to offset the cost of their own supplies;  others \nlike Molly and Murray, became involved as a business opportunity and an entrepreneurial \nchallenge while also \u2018doing good\u2019 for others, but had then begun to take the products \nthemselves. Molly explained how the two-pronged approach had been precisely what had \ninspired her to give up her previous job to take on network marketing as a distributor:   \n\u2026there are different levels [of commission] as you keep going and enrol more people \u2026.  \nonce you hit executive, you get ten percent of everything everyone else earns as well \u2026 it \nsounds really cheesy but we are not focusing on the money at the moment because you \ncan\u2019t rely on it at this stage of the game it\u2019s more about just getting people into it and \nwhen I do get paid it\u2019s great, it\u2019s awesome, and I\u2019m definitely getting way more than I \nwas this time last month but I\u2019m not just sitting there waiting for the pay cheque.  I\u2019m \nsitting there going right, who else can I help.  Because I think if you start to focus on the \nmoney it just all goes out the window. \u2026 You\u2019ve got to have dreams and you\u2019ve got to \nwant the cars and that sort of thing or you won\u2019t do anything to get there but I think if \nyour number one goal is to help people, life\u2019s going to be better off.   (Molly) \nHowever, network marketing is more than a business opportunity that has a mildly idealistic \nflavour.  The distributors are encouraged to identify with the company and show loyalty and \ncommitment to it, becoming emotionally as well as financially invested, so that their personal \nand business lives are interlinked.  The creation of an identity and a group of like-minded \ncontacts built around the material \u2018things\u2019 (the products) draws on an assemblage of \nentrepreneurialism, social capital (Lin, 2007), brand commitment and loyalty (Hur et al., 2011), \nwhile also being inspired by the idea of helping (or saving) others whose health is affected.  The \nimplicit promise is not only of health and happiness, but also prosperity for those who are \nprepared to place their trust in the company and its products.  Pratt (2000: 456) interprets this \nstrategy as a necessary one to \u2018win the hearts and minds\u2019 of those who work for a network \nmarketing organisation in the absence of regular hours, work colleagues, a physical location, and \nthe psychological contract of job security provided in the traditional workplace.    \n137 \n \n \nPart of the identity creation appears to be the implicit invitation to the distributor to model \nthemselves on the inspirational life story of the company founder which, as Cardwell (1998:17) \ndescribes, commonly follows a nearly identical trajectory in all companies:      \n \u2026the guru as head of the company [who] \u2026was told by conventional medicine that he \u2026 \nhad only six weeks/months/hours to live.  Fortunately they found one or more \u2018natural\u2019 \nplant based products that cured their cancer \u2026 and now they have a fundamental and \nevangelistic desire to sell their amazing product to the world.    \nThis was indeed closely paralleled by four stories that were related to me by different \nparticipants about four different brands of products.  Each time it was presented as a type of \nhero\u2019s journey (Campbell, 1973); the quest of the company founder to overcome a health threat \nto themselves or a close family member; the breakthrough discovery after a period of isolation \nor intense study; the struggle to overcome others\u2019 disbelief; and their subsequent dedication to \nsharing their discovery for the betterment of the world and making a fortune in the process.  \nHere is just one of them:     \nThe history behind it was a guy from South Korea [who] was a billionaire.  He was an \nindustrialist and the story is that he got stomach cancer.  So he went and lived up in the \nmountains somewhere and started eating an aloe plant, and basically lived off an aloe \nvera plant for quite a long time and then went back down and got tested and his \nstomach cancer was gone.  So he took all his money and basically sold all his assets from \nhis steel and invested it in this technology for aloe vera plants and then built these big \nfarms and then started a system where you buy in, you sell it to your friends and you get \na profit.  \u2026. they would give this big seminar to everyone and tell them how this special \nherbal \u2013 medicine I guess \u2013 has changed their life.  Everything from people\u2019s stomach \ncramps to all these different types of healing, almost like miracles that they\u2019ve \nexperienced with this.  (Duncan) \nThese narratives with their tales of the quest, seclusion from the world, and return with \u201cthe \ngoods of salvation\u201d (Rey, 2004: 331), had unmistakable overtones that resonated with the \nmyths, legends, and religious figures that were described in the background chapter.  Albertson \n(2011: 127) draws attention to the implicit appeal of religious language in societies where \n\u201c\u2026religion has old roots in the lives of many \u2026 people carry emotional and cognitive residue \nfrom their pasts that are at work in their current political attitudes and choices.\u201d Even for those \nwithout these religious echoes from their past, the narratives in fairy tales abound with the \n138 \n \n \nsame elements of quest and salvation.  These generic tales or \u201cur-narratives \u2026contain the seeds \nof many genres\u201d (Berger 2016: 71); in them the heroes are often aided by magic objects or \n\u2018things\u2019 through which they manage to find the inner strength to prevail over difficulties. The \nuniversal appeal of the hero(ine) winning the battle against the odds would seem to be not only \ndeeply rooted in the ancient myths of humanity\u2019s distant past but to be always evolving, \nrearranging itself to any context without losing its intrinsic qualities. Rey (2004: 333) has drawn \nattention to the way these ur-narratives are echoed in economic success stories of this sort, \nwhen the company founder, the \u2018charismatic prophet\u2019 produces symbolic goods for benefit of \nthe people.  Even in network marketing the reworking of these themes with their origins in the \ndistant past demonstrates that \u201cmythology shows itself to be as amenable as life itself to the \nobsessions and requirements of the individual, the race, the age\u201d (Campbell 1973: 330).   \nAll the companies named by study participants were based in the United States, where there is a \nlengthy history of network marketing companies being investigated by the US Food and Drug \nAdministration for deceptive marketing practices or conducting illegal pyramid selling schemes \nfocused around the material products (Anonymous, 2003; Berg, 1994; Herbig & Yelkurm, 1997). \nOne controversial area has been the evangelistic nature of network company distributors in their \nefforts to recruit others.   The fascination and fear associated with such companies has led to \nthem being described as cults (Bhattacharya & Mehta, 2000; Krzywirzeka, 2013) who use \u201cmind \ncontrol\u201d (Pratt, 2000: 456) to exert overly strong attachments among their adherents.  Certainly \nthose participants who were currently distributors for network marketing companies at the time \nI spoke to them were fulsome and evangelistic in the way they spoke about the products (the \n\u2018things\u2019).  They demonstrated high levels of commitment, enthusiasm, and a sense of making a \nworthwhile contribution by making the company products available to people who needed help.  \nWhile they at no time appeared to be in the grip of a cult, I gained the impression that too much \nconfidence in the company\u2019s products could lead to potentially overblown claims about what \ntheir \u2018things\u2019 could achieve.  One network marketer gave an account of stepping in to help an \nacquaintance who was awaiting an amputation in hospital because of diabetic complications:  \nSo it is a very simple programme getting rid of diabetes and our shake just puts your \nblood sugar right straight away.  \u2026   Well!  The next day he is sitting up in bed and he is \ncoming to life already. Each day they said, Oh, he\u2019s getting stronger by the day.  Well, \nwhen they got him back [to hospital], his blood sugar was exactly right \u2026  Everything was \ncoming right after four days and then the surgeon looked at his leg and said, \u201cI must \nhave made a mistake.  He doesn\u2019t need his leg off!\u201d (Clara)  \n139 \n \n \nClara here represents the \u2018shake\u2019 that she gave to her acquaintance as being the \u2018goods of \nsalvation\u2019 mentioned above, that saved his leg.  Molly, however, was much more reserved about \nwhat she claimed to do herself, noting that she would never give more than generic advice but \nwould always refer to other sources in her company:  \nThere\u2019s certain things you can and can\u2019t do.  So if you are not a qualified nutritionist you \ncan\u2019t give nutrition advice.  \u2026.  You\u2019ve just got to be really careful and that\u2019s fair enough \nbecause if you are not qualified I don\u2019t feel you should do it anyway.  (Molly) \nAnother major criticism of network marketing has highlighted the high rates of turnover among \ndisillusioned distributors, with some said to be filled with hatred for the companies they \nformerly belonged to (Pratt, 2000; Mswelli and Sargeant, 2001).  There were a few study \nparticipants who were ex-network marketers, but they were neutral about the companies they \nhad been involved with.  It seemed that they had mostly been drawn in to oblige a friend or \nrelative but and had never fully \u2018bought in\u2019 emotionally to the assemblage of discourses that \nhinged on the \u2018thing power\u2019 of the products that the companies sold.  Moreover, the expense of \nthe products deterred younger people who were not yet well established financially and they \nfound the commitment more than they could maintain on their limited budget:  \nI think it was about $60 \u2026 I remember I got a discount I think of 20%.  That was still a lot \nfor me anyway.  I think they would expect you to get a new one [pack] every one or two \nmonths.  I can\u2019t really afford that. (Iris) \nDuncan also had a history of being both a user and distributor and although he had extricated \nhimself from the company without great difficulty, he admitted that the entanglement of \npersonal and business relationships had made it awkward.  He too had found it an expensive \nexercise:  \nIt\u2019s a community; you make friends, you get involved and it almost turns into a \ncommunity group.  You know, you go to meetings together and you make friends\u2026    And \nthen they would say, well you know, you purchase this.  The thing was that a bottle like \nthis [indicating size] was about $90 so it would last you a month.  (Duncan) \nNetwork marketing proved to be an interesting way of examining the assemblage of actants \naround supplements from a different angle.  It encompassed the same levers of supply and \ndemand, and the same discourses of naturalness and risk.  However, it differed in that it drew \ndirectly on personal commitment to a particular company and appealed more intensely to \n140 \n \n \nemotional engagement with \u2018things\u2019 which not only had value as supplements but also \nsymbolised the underlying narrative of altruism and salvation more overtly entangled with the \neconomic values of entrepreneurialism and personal profit (Berger, 2016: 71), in a way that was \nabsent from those participants who sold products in health stores and pharmacies.   \nConclusion \nIn concluding this chapter, it is useful to return to Bennett\u2019s words quoted at the beginning of \nthe chapter, framing non-human matter as:  \n\u2026an actant inside and alongside intention-forming, morality-(dis)obeying, language \nusing, reflexivity wielding and culture making human beings and as an inducer-producer \nof salient, public effects (Bennett, 2010: 39).    \nAssemblages of ingested matter, whether supplements, pharmaceuticals or ordinary foods, \nwhether helpful or harmful, have been analysed from countless medical, public health, \ncommercial, and sociological perspectives but human behaviour has almost always been at the \ncentre of these analyses (Flegal et al., 2012; Gotay et al., 2013; Mayes, 2015; Mitchell, 2001; \nWang & Lim, 2012).  Here, in contrast, non-human things have been brought into the foreground \nas vital matter that acted as an important catalyst in the participants\u2019 lives.  What may have \nbegun as a minor or random decision to take a supplement \u2018thing\u2019 appeared to have had the \npower to generate physical, mental and spiritual effects in their lives and given them hope for \nthe future, even if their basic conditions were still troublesome.  They had developed a personal \nstory around their supplement use that resulted from a maze of connections in which the \nmaterial products - the things \u2013 had a central role in making their story what it was. The meaning \nwas what mattered; the precise mechanism by which the \u2018thing\u2019 mattered, appeared to be \nirrelevant.    \nHumans organize their experiences into temporarily meaningful episodes.  Narrative is \nboth a mode of reasoning and a mode of representation.  People can \u201capprehend\u201d the \nworld narratively and people can \u201ctell\u201d about the world narratively.  \u2026 Explanation in the \nnarrative mode is contextually embedded, whereas the logico-scientific explanation is \nextracted from spatial and temporal events.  Both modes are rational ways of making \nmeaning (Richardson, 1990: 118).   \nMoreover, the meaning they drew from their products was not static but always in process, \nconstantly forming and reforming as it evolved and changed.  The participants were part of this \n141 \n \n \ndynamic evolution, contributing to its onward movement through the effects of their actions to \nresearch, purchase and consume supplements to look after their health.  These activities were \nalso changing the participants themselves as they gained experience and expertise as \n\u2018supplement users\u2019.  The effect of their interaction with the \u2018thing power\u2019 of the supplements \nappeared to have given them a sense of control over their health care options and to be an \nimportant influence in their decision making not only for themselves but in their interactions \nwith orthodox health care options.  The next chapter moves on to tackle the issue of power and \nexpertise over health and to look at the part supplements played in identity building for \nparticipants in their ongoing life journey.     \n  \n142 \n \n \nChapter 6: Supplements: through responsibility and expertise to \npower \nIntroduction \nThe previous chapter ended by looking forward to the sense of control that the participants \nexperienced through making independent decisions around supplements and health.  This \nchapter examines the assemblage of ideas that had come together to build that sense of control.  \nPrimarily, these focused around two prominent themes that were raised by the participants: \nbeing responsible about their health, and developing expertise in doing so. The participants \nclearly saw themselves as responsible people who were taking every care to look after their \nhealth, yet they were quite well aware that supplement use was not endorsed as a responsible \npractice by health experts.  They did not see this as a conflict, however, but viewed their \nsupplements as something extra that they could do over and above following the recommended \nprecepts about living a healthy life.  Moreover, they explained, they were becoming their own \nexperts about supplements and their uses, searching out information from a wide range of \nsources and putting their new knowledge into practice as they learned more about them.   For \nthose participants who also sold supplements, this included building expertise in how to advise \nothers in their use.    \nTo examine these issues relating to the tension between authorised advice and independent \ndecisions that deviate from it, this chapter draws from Foucault\u2019s concepts of biopower and \ngovernmentality as they are manifested in the modern neoliberal state.  As Foucault described \nit, biopower is the guiding and shaping of citizens to be \u201ceminently governable\u201d neoliberal \nsubjects (Lorenzini, 2018: 155). Biopower operates through what Foucault termed the \u2018conduct \nof conduct\u2019 (Burchell et al., 1991; Foucault, 1988; Lemke, 2002),  that is, the provision of \nguidance by officially authorised experts so that people internalise the approved way to behave \nand do so freely, but in a way which also serves the interests of the state (Danaher et al., 2000; \nPetersen & Lupton, 1996).  In the sphere of health, governmentality works by encouraging \npeople to take responsibility for looking after themselves according to the advice of medical \nprofessionals and public health experts who are credentialed and sanctioned by the state.  They \nare seen as the repository of expert knowledge which is deployed in \u201cshaping the thoughts and \nactions of subjects in order to make them more useful and \u2018governable\u2019\u201d(Petersen & Lupton, \n1996: 14).  Choosing to follow the advice and make \u2018correct\u2019 choices, they reduce their likelihood \nof becoming unwell and therefore creating a burden for themselves and for the state to look \n143 \n \n \nafter.  Responsible citizens who have internalised this advice and willingly submit to this \n\u2018conduct of conduct\u2019, have the greatest likelihood of being considered well-ordered and healthy, \nthereby contributing to the productivity of the state as a whole.  While individuals are not forced \nto conform to these norms, they are encouraged to see them as being in their own interests.   \nNevertheless, many people do resist being \u2018conducted\u2019 according to recommended advice. They \nmay continue to smoke, drink too much alcohol or keep on with \u2018unhealthy eating\u2019 that makes \nthem overweight, even though they know quite well that these are not considered responsible \nhealth practices.  Yet all these behaviours are quite legal and the products that enable them are \neasily available, often heavily advertised with special offers and discounting that make them \neven more attractive.  Viewed from an economic perspective, the buying and selling of such \nthings is generally seen as uncontroversial, for they fit with the modern neoliberal state\u2019s focus \non ensuring that the freedom of the market is maintained, that consumers keep spending, and \nthat the economy continues to grow.  The interests of the market, therefore, frequently run \ndirectly counter to expert advice on health and take precedence over policies which would be \nlikely to constrain commercial activity and inhibit growth.  Instead, the onus is placed on \nindividuals to be \u2018responsible\u2019 and refrain from indulging in behaviours which are not approved \n(Herrick, 2011).   Clearly, supplements are in a different category from these overtly harmful \nproducts, but they too are frowned on by health experts, albeit for different reasons.  There are \ncontinuing calls for more restrictions on their availability or to bring them under the control of \nhealth professionals.  Yet the importance of the commercial activity these products generate \n(Grand View Research, 2019) appears to outweigh the voices of health experts when it comes to \npolicy making and regulations.   \nBy resisting authorised health advice and instead turning to the market for their products, \nhowever,  it may be that individuals who wish to use or sell supplements are merely exchanging \none form of being conducted for another, that is, the subtle and less overtly stated form of \ncontrol that commercial interests exercise over people who buy their products (Kasabov, 2004).   \nFoucault\u2019s concept of governmentality has been taken up and applied to this viewpoint as well, \nshowing that the ever increasing use of digital surveillance is continually and relentlessly \ngathering and analysing the personal details and habits of those who buy, whether they shop \nonline or in person  (Ganesh, 2016).  This digital surveillance has been likened to an \u201celectronic \nsuper-Panopticon\u201d (Zwick & Knott, 2009: 227) that constructs consumers as passive \ncommodities to be manipulated by personalised advertising (Couldry & Turow, 2014).  They are \nseen as being induced to spend money on products that merely enrich commercial companies \n144 \n \n \nand their shareholders and that do nothing to benefit the people that buy them (Boyd & \nCrawford, 2012; Brayne, 2017; Ganesh, 2016).   \nThis construction, however, would seem to underestimate the power of ordinary citizens.   The \ntensions between the two competing forces \u2013 that is, the conduct of citizens by expert health \nadvice and the machinations of the market to control them \u2013 create areas of \u201cfragility and \nblindspots\u201d where the modern neoliberal state is at cross purposes with itself (Lorenzini, 2018: \n157).  Individuals such as the participants may engage in what Foucault termed \u201cstrategic games \nbetween liberties\u201d (Foucault 1988 cited in Lemke 2002: 53), that is, they may use their freedom \ncreatively to exploit those tensions and resist being \u2018conducted\u2019 quite so much (Lorenzini, 2018).  \nIn effect, this response by individuals is another example of the far reaching interconnections \nthat are possible in the rhizomatic network of actants that are interconnected in a moving \nassemblage around a particular issue.  By exploring and experimenting with ways to benefit from \nall the options that are available from both orthodox health advice and the commercial market, \nand resisting and avoiding those aspects they dislike, they may develop expertise in using both \nto maximum advantage for themselves, thereby gaining a sense of control and independence \nfrom both.   \nThis chapter has three sections that discuss these issues in the light of the participants\u2019 reports.  \nThe first focuses on the participants\u2019 construction of themselves as responsible and morally \n\u2018good\u2019 people who took great care to look after their health.  It then follows on to show how \ntheir ideas of responsibility had evolved, continuing to be underpinned by basic health advice \nfrom orthodox medicine and public health, but developing, in addition, their own individualised \napproach through their use of supplements.  I show how they navigated their way between the \ncontrasting forces of being responsible in terms of official health advice on the one hand, and \nthe societal encouragement to participate avidly in the supplement market on the other.  I look \nat the influence of marketing models on orthodox health itself and how the development of the \n\u2018health consumer\u2019 has encouraged people like the participants to mobilise their ability to buy \nand sell in any market, including \u2018shopping around\u2019 for health care.  The second half of the \nchapter moves on to focus on the participants\u2019 evolving expertise about supplements as their \nexperience with them grew.  Drawing again from the concept of the rhizomatic network \n(Deleuze & Guatarri, 1987), it shows the range of actants that the participants were able to bring \ntogether to create individualised assemblages of knowledge, connecting multiple and disparate \nthreads of information and experience to gain confidence and control over choosing appropriate \nhealth care options in different circumstances.  For those who also sold supplements, their \n145 \n \n \npersonal expertise was further enhanced as they took steps to learn more about their products \nso as to feel confident in advising others. A final section then looks at the way the participants\u2019 \nenhanced skills and confidence had become woven into their life narrative and was contributing \nto their ongoing identity formation.   \nBeing a responsible citizen    \nAs an overall group, the participants appeared to exemplify the ideal neoliberal citizen who has \ninternalised the importance of monitoring and self-managing their health. They made numerous \nunprompted comments about the importance they placed on being responsible and took pains \nto demonstrate that they knew about the basic principles of a healthy lifestyle and were doing \ntheir best to put them into practice:   \n I\u2019m into the whole thing about doing the best you can for your body, looking after \nyourself.  (Frances)   \nWithout exception they indicated that they saw responsibility as a positive thing in their lives. \nThey did not consider it to be a burdensome duty, but something in which they chose freely and \nin which they could take pride and satisfaction.  Bryony, for example, saw being responsible for \none\u2019s health as a positive aspiration that everyone should work towards: \n  \u2026.  my biggest thing is about people taking responsibility \u2013 checking in with their body \nand learning to be able to understand what it needs, when it needs, and be their own \ndirector of health.  \u2026.  So they are actually the person living in their body and they have \nchosen to take responsibility for how they are and how well their body is.  So to me, that \nis the ultimate. (Bryony)  \nBryony and Frances both indicate here that they see responsibility as being in their own interests \nand as the \u2018right\u2019 thing to aspire to.  They both appear to draw on the idea of the physical body \nas something that needs tending carefully as a mediator between \u201cthe world around us and our \ninternal thoughts, feelings and sensations\u201d (Fox, 2012: 1).  Bryony\u2019s remarks in particular seem \nto construct the body as an \u201ceminently governable subject\u201d (Lorenzini, 2018: 155) of the overall \nperson, nicely reflecting in microcosm the concept of the person as a subject of the state.  Her \ncomment suggests that the underlying concepts of governmentality have become deeply, if \nunconsciously, internalised into her world view.  All participants represented themselves in \nmuch the same way as Bryony and Frances; as \u2018good subjects\u2019, consciously doing their best to \nkeep themselves healthy in the present and using strategies they hoped would maintain and \n146 \n \n \nprotect their health into the future.  As far as I could tell, none of them smoked and none were \nobese; if they had indulged in \u2018bad\u2019 health behaviours in the past, which one participant did \nspeak about, they had long left them behind.  Moreover, they were not simply refraining from \npoor health habits, but had also adopted the proactive diet and exercise behaviours that are \nrecommended by authorised experts for a healthy lifestyle (Steptoe et al., 2002).  Many \nmentioned the importance of eating well, especially ensuring they ate enough vegetables, for \nexample, this comment from Bob: \nWell I\u2019ve always been a bit diet conscious.  I don\u2019t have butter and I don\u2019t have \nmargarine.  I\u2019m not an absolute fanatic.  I don\u2019t sit down and have a roast meal now \u2026 \nI\u2019ve always eaten a lot of vegetables; I\u2019ve got a fairly good vege garden now... I \nconsciously think I should drink more water.   \nA considerable number of participants were actively engaged in various sports, with some of \nthem having been involved for most of their lives.  Even those that did not undertake regular \nsporting activities talked about the importance of ensuring they had some form of exercise.  \nWendy had \u201cstarted exercising, cycling and stuff \u2026 you know, you have to balance exercise with \ndiet and mix that up with vegetables\u201d.  It was clear from the way that participants presented \nthemselves that they saw their behaviour as being congruent with the framing of responsibility \nas a positive and autonomous way to exercise freedom of choice about looking after oneself and \nensuring that they lived a healthy life.  \nSeveral of the participants had also adopted a distinctly moral tone towards those whose \nbehaviour they perceived as being less responsible than the standards they applied to \nthemselves.  Johnny, for example, said he had noticed that he took care of himself \u201ca little bit \nmore than maybe some people\u201d.  Lesley more overtly constructed herself as responsible in \ncontrast to others whom she considered were failing to do the right thing in spite of her efforts \nas a health store owner to inform and guide them about the correct way to live in a healthy way:      \n I think it is important that people understand that they actually have to be responsible \nfor their own health in lots of ways.  They have to take the bull by the horns themselves. \n\u2026  I give them information [original emphasis]  \u2026  I know usually whether they are ready \nto run with it \u2026 you can tell, I mean, you know if someone\u2019s just after a quick fix \u2026  \n(Lesley).   \nLesley implies that people who just want a \u2018quick fix\u2019 are too lazy or irresponsible to make any \neffort themselves even when she has told them what to do.   She echoes the judgemental \n147 \n \n \n\u2018othering\u2019 of people who are believed to be shirking their responsibility to be healthy (Thompson \n& Kumar, 2011).  There are clear moral meanings in pursuing healthy living that affirm people\u2019s \nself-image as being \u2018good\u2019 and allow them to contrast themselves with others whom they view \nas having less healthy habits.  Those who continue to smoke, take illegal drugs, drink too much \nalcohol, or are obese tend to be seen as irresponsible, even deviant, if they persist in keeping up \ntheir behaviours rather than address them with expert advice (Greener et al., 2010; LeBesco, \n2011; Measham & Brain, 2005; Pennay & Moore, 2010; Rideout & Barr, 2009).  Such people  may \nbe considered personally undeserving of the health care they will need in the future because of \ntheir poor choices, as well as an economic drain on the health system and therefore a cost to all \nof society (Frohlich et al., 2012; Lupton, 1999).  As Herrick (2011: 21) succinctly puts it, \u201chealth \nand responsibility rarely venture out unaccompanied by each other because individual lifestyle \nchoices condition the risk of chronic disease.\u201d Lesley and Johnny\u2019s comments indicate that this \nattitude does not just emanate from health authorities but also tends to become the norm \namong those who see themselves as \u2018good\u2019 subjects.  Viewing others as bringing ill health on \nthemselves through failing to address their \u2018irresponsible\u2019 lifestyle habits has been interpreted \nas a modern manifestation of ancient concepts of illness as a retribution for sin (Douglas, 1992; \nLupton, 2013). Although modern medicine makes a feature of being scientific, unbiased, and \ntherefore that it stands outside moral considerations, \u201cmorals remain deeply embedded in our \nconsiderations of health and disease\u201d (Brandt & Rozin, 1997: 2).  It is not hard to see how these \nideas embedded in religious belief systems from earliest times can easily be transferred into \nsecular society so that:     \n \u2026 \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018illness\u2019 become tools of government.  What was once part of a system of \ncontrol based on a belief in divine retribution is now embedded in a network of power \nrelations which is integral to the notions of freedom of choice (Galvin, 2002: 130).   \nA few participants, resisted being drawn into the good/bad, responsible/irresponsible citizen \ndiscourse.  Vonnie talked about the life circumstances that limited many people\u2019s capacity to be \nresponsible about their health, indicating that she was speaking from her own experiences as a \nworker in community health.  She recognised that the issue was a great deal more nuanced and \ncomplex than telling people what to do and then getting them to \u2018choose\u2019 to do it: \n\u2026. sometimes people are just overwhelmed by life \u2013 overwhelmed by the lack of choices. \nIn some cases there is some personal responsibility certainly [but] I notice that often in \nthe community, people really, really try very hard but if you are on a really strict budget \nand you are working two part time jobs and you\u2019ve got kids to get to school and you\u2019ve \n148 \n \n \ngot your elderly mum living with you or your extended whanau [family] living with you, \nyou try and make ends meet and try and be \u2018healthy\u2019 or try and stay \u2018well\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s really \ndifficult.  (Vonnie) \nVonnie\u2019s comments here draw on the concept of the determinants of health \u2013 the resources \navailable to a person in terms of income, food and housing security, cultural background, \neducation and social connectivity \u2013 that influence the amount of responsibility that each \nindividual is able to have over managing their health even if they know what they ought to be \ndoing (Marmot, 2005).  Vonnie\u2019s reflections, based on her working knowledge of others\u2019 \ndisadvantage, were unusual among the participants, who generally appeared to take it for \ngranted that being responsible about health was something that everyone could and should be \nable to do as they themselves were doing.  \nReconfiguring responsibility: supplement users \nIn spite of their \u2018good\u2019 citizen behaviour, participants presented something of a paradox from \nthe perspective of official advice, as they were all keenly engaged with supplements as users, \nsellers, or both.  Although supplements are hardly in the same category as smoking, obesity, and \ntoo much alcohol, they were quite well aware of the orthodox view that treating oneself with \nsupplements was both potentially risky and probably futile (Eliason et al., 1999; Hensrud et al., \n1999; Walji et al., 2010) and that by using or selling them they had moved outside the sphere of \nrecommended health protecting behaviour.  However, rather than seeing themselves as \nirresponsible, participants seemed to consider that their supplement use was a way to be even \nmore proactive about being healthy \u2013 a type of \u2018responsibility plus\u2019.  Pam explained, for example, \nthat she had been taking multivitamins for some while but had recently decided to change to a \nnew brand with more components and had added glucosamine as well:   \nSusan: So did you start taking the glucosamine off your own bat?  \nPam:  Yes, well pretty much so.    Just having problems with muscular problems and \nthings like that\u2026 I thought taking that would be an added bonus for me and it \nseems to have helped.  And that there (indicating the container), the multivite.  I \nalways have really, been taking multivitamins\u2026  It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve taken it \nright through, you know \u2013 from A to Zinc \u2026 so it will be interesting to see.  Seems \nto be OK.  (Pam) \n149 \n \n \nThere were many other instances like Pam\u2019s where participants reported a particular trigger that \nhad led them to start on supplements, none of which had been on the advice of a health \nprofessional.  It appeared that having a firm belief in themselves as responsible, autonomous \ncitizens, they were confident in deciding what was appropriate to try for themselves. There was \nno indication from any of them that their actions were deliberately designed to resist expert \nadvice; none gave the impression that they were  on a personal crusade  or that they were \nactivists in a social movement with a \u201cpoliticized collective illness identity\u201d (Brown et al., 2004: \n60,64), that had been formed to challenge accepted knowledge and practice.  Most often their \ncomments simply indicated that their involvement with supplements had begun as a pragmatic \nstrategy that filled an unmet need for them at the time and was, as Pam said, \u2018an added bonus\u2019  \nto anything that medical professionals might offer them. As Rana commented, about her \ndecision to take evening primrose oil for her menopausal symptoms, \u201cI\u2019d read the material, and \nOK, this is what I want.  It won\u2019t harm me.\u201d  Nevertheless, even though they did not articulate \ntheir decision as such, they were, in effect, challenging the power of expert health authorities to \ndecide what was good or not good for them.  It was their own form of counter-conduct, a \nresistance to being conducted by experts, and making the decision to \u201cconduct \u2026the domain of \n[their] own conduct or behaviour\u201d (Foucault 1997 cited in Lorenzini 2018: 194-5) and go straight \nto the market for what they wanted. In contrast to the interpretation of the disordered body \nthat represents a \u201cmoral failing\u201d because it needs to be reordered with prescribed medicines \n(Dew et al., 2015: 272) , the participants clearly saw their self-chosen ingestion of supplements \nas quite the opposite; that was an additional way of responsibly \u2018ordering\u2019 themselves and, by \nimplication, also morally good.  \nThis reconfiguring of responsibility into independent, \u201chybridised medication practices beyond \nthe purview of medicine\u2019s centres of calculation\u201d (Dew et al., 2014: 39), however, meets with \ndisapproval from experts; people are not supposed to treat themselves without consulting a \nhealth professional (Bond & Hannaford, 2003; Ventola, 2010).  Doing so is framed from the \northodox perspective as lay people being over-confident about their own judgement and \u201cat risk \nof being exploited, losing their money and damaging their health\u201d (Ernst & Singh, 2008: 281). In \nresponse, health professionals over the years have continued to call for more regulation over \nsupplement sales citing the same concerns about effectiveness and safety as noted above \n(Dwyer et al., 2018; Fontanarosa et al., 2003; Starr, 2015). Yet while these statements come \nfrom one branch of authorised expertise and appear to be taken seriously, the importance of the \nsupplement industry to commercial activity and economic growth (Grand View Research, 2019) \n150 \n \n \nseems to outweigh the imposition of any further restrictions.  In New Zealand, for example, a \nsurvey of New Zealand companies engaged in the manufacture and marketing of supplements \nestimated that the industry had a turnover of $1.4 billion with projections that there would be \nbetween 30-50% growth over the next three years (Crowe Horwath, 2014).  Moreover, the \nexport of dietary supplements containing locally grown botanical ingredients is enthusiastically \nsupported by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, an agency of government (Natural Health \nProducts New Zealand, 2019).  From this point of view, it appears, growth in the market that \nresults in an increasing number of people buying supplements is framed as an entirely positive \nthing.  \nFor responsibility and healthy behaviour are only one aspect of what the modern state needs \nfrom its citizens.  It also requires them to be \u2018good\u2019 at participating in the market, buying and \nselling products and services that keep the economy growing.  Messages urging people to be \nresponsible and restrain themselves from indulging in \u2018unhealthy\u2019 behaviour compete constantly \nwith counter messages that urge consumers to keep consuming. People are strongly encouraged \nto spend, no matter if they spend on \u2018irresponsible\u2019 products:  \nThe one thing that would utterly destroy the new capitalism is the serious practice of \ndeferred gratification. (Bell 1976: 78 in Starr, 2007: 214) \nEconomic growth is seen as not only important, but \u201cmorally necessary\u201d (Baumol et al., 2007: \n33) and is helped along by commercial interests that encourage a recurring cycle of acquisition, \nuse and disposal of a vast array of products and services for the general public to consume \n(Gregson et al., 2007; McCollough, 2009).  If consumer spending falls in any one quarter, there \nare immediate concerns about faltering growth and the viability of the economy, underlining the \n\u201ctensions that mark out neoliberalism as continually at odds with its own ends and means\u201d \n(Herrick, 2011: 33).    \nThese tensions between expert advice on the one hand and strong encouragement to spend, no \nmatter on what, provide opportunities for people to navigate between the two forces, \nmobilising their autonomy as responsible citizens to bypass the official \u2018expert\u2019 power of \northodox health care, and decide for themselves how to act independently.   The participants\u2019 \nchoice to buy (or sell) supplements was a manifestation of the way that the ordinary citizen can \ncarry out independent choices about how to implement their responsibility on their own terms, \nbypassing orthodoxy and turning to the market.    But could their claims of positive and \nindependent action to be extra responsible about their health be taken at face value?  Or was \n151 \n \n \ntheir resistance to expert messages about avoiding supplements simply a sign that they were \nunwittingly moving into the grasp of yet another manifestation of power, and one which does \nnot pretend to aim at public good, but at profit?  The participants\u2019 remarks strongly suggested \nthat they were not so easily duped.  \nAll participants, whether they used or sold supplements (or both), talked about cost in our \ndiscussions.  Many of them, without prompting, explained their methods for navigating their \nway through the market, assessing products carefully so that they obtained the best buy for the \nlowest cost.  Trudy outlined how she carried out her own investigation, comparing prices and \nquality of a magnesium supplement from three different sources \u2013 a pharmacy, a health store, \nand a supermarket - to ensure she got value for her money:   \n\u2026.   when I went to the chemist they had exactly the same brand [name] that the \nsupermarket had but slightly more expensive \u2026So I thought \u2026  I am going to try a generic \nbrand because if it helps, it helps; if it doesn\u2019t, I wasted huge amounts of money. So I \ntried it, found it really good and I went to a health store [name of store] \u2026 and asked \nthem and they said that\u2019s fine \u2026but this particular magnesium is more pure and it is from \na different source and so we would probably recommend you take this.  \u2026  So I tried it, \nbut if I am totally honest, I couldn\u2019t tell the difference.  It wasn\u2019t significantly better, or \nsignificantly worse and anyway it was pretty much the same so I thought, why pay an \nextra twenty dollars.  (Trudy) \nTrudy constructs herself here as a sensible consumer, using personal responsibility and informed \nchoice, the \u201cbedrocks of neoliberal health policy\u201d (Herrick, 2011: 17).  Her independent decision \nmaking shows she does not need a health professional to tell her what to take or advise her on \nits use, but at the same time, she resists being treated as a \u2018commodity\u2019 in the market, carrying \nout her own tests on what works for her and disregarding the claims that the health store staff \nmake about the advantage of their more expensive product.   \nParticipants cited many instances to demonstrate that they had a well-developed sense of \nscepticism about overblown advertising claims that were designed to encourage them to buy \nproducts they did not want.  Far from being cynically manipulated by the wiles of self-interested \ncommercial entities, they tended to approach their supplements purchases or sales much as any \nother commercial transaction, many mentioning their sensitivity to various brands, prices and \nservices that gave them the best value.  As a group, they appeared well able to use their \nconsiderable consumer skills to resist being turned into a \u201ccommodity item to be utilised for \n152 \n \n \ncommercial advantage\u201d (Lewis, 2019; Sturgeon, 2014: 414). They were also conscious that they \nwere fortunate to have the personal and financial resources that allowed them this freedom of \nchoice in the market:   \nIt\u2019s bloody expensive.  To actually treat yourself with supplements is extremely expensive \nso obviously not everybody can do it. So I\u2019m very lucky that I can experiment with these \nthings.  When I retire it might be a slightly different thing. (Tessa)   \nSupplements and alternative therapies are not cheap and the full range of the products in the \nhealth \u2018supermarket\u2019 is only accessible to those who are well established economically \n(Vatanparast et al., 2010).   Although I chose not to question participants about their income \nlevel, education, or other circumstances, it was nevertheless clear from the discussions with \nthem that most were well enough off to have at least some level of discretionary income that \ngave them the capacity to buy supplements.  \nIn spite of the participants\u2019 apparent success in resisting commercial pressure, it is nevertheless \nclear that supplement marketing is highly successful on a global scale (Grand View Research, \n2019).  The promotion of products for personal health is sophisticated and extensive so that they \nappeal to the widest range of people who might be encouraged to buy them, whether they need \nthem or not.  Supplements were the consumer choice for the participants, but they are just one \npart of the much wider assemblage of health-associated products.  These include extensive \nranges of exercise and sports equipment, clothing, and special accessories designed to appeal to \nindividuals of any age, personality type, or physical ability whether they are already leading a \npurist healthy lifestyle or are \u201cmerely mainstream people who are attempting to live a little \nhealthier\u201d [sic] (Divine & Lepisto, 2005: 276).  These products are continually being developed \nand refreshed in the same way as supplements to fill the needs of people who are looking for \nproducts and services that make the pursuit of the responsible, healthy lifestyle \u201cboth \npleasurable and possible\u201d (Herrick, 2011: 29).   \nThe success of the techniques that \u2018sell health\u2019 in this way (Aschemann-Witzel et al., 2012) is just \none of the ways that health and commerce have become entangled.  Individuals, such as the \nparticipants do appear to view health care as a \u2018product\u2019 that they can assess for value against \nother alternatives in the same way as they would do with any commercial transaction.   Jordan, a \npharmacist, reported that he frequently became aware of a history of \u2018shopping around\u2019 in the \npeople who came to him hoping they might be able to \u2018buy\u2019 better health:   \n153 \n \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t like my doctor or what he\u2019s doing any more.  What else can you give me \ninstead?\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of being sick and tired and I\u2019ve gone to the doctor and tells \nme that I am old and put up with it.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m this or I\u2019m that and this is all he can do\u201d, or \n\u201cI don\u2019t like doctors at all; I\u2019m not going to the doctor at all, I would much rather come to \nyou.\u201d  Or, \u201cI\u2019ve been to six specialists, three GPs and a crystal gazer and massage and \nnone of them have helped so I thought I would try you\u201d.  (Jordan) \nThe promotion of supplements may be one factor that has contributed to people taking a \ncommercial approach to health care, but there are others too.  Within health care itself, \u2018social \nmarketing\u2019 campaigns have widely adopted tactics that \u201cmimick the political rationality of the \nmarket \u2026 and reflect the dominance of capitalist logics of production, consumption and \norganisation\u201d (Crawshaw, 2012: 2000-2201).   Social marketing is constructed as being different \nfrom \u2018ordinary\u2019 marketing because it aims for social good rather than commercial gain \n(Aschemann-Witzel et al., 2012; Farr et al., 2008).  The uncritical adoption of such overtly \ncommercial techniques, however, has been recognised as being an uncomfortable fit with health \n(Peattie & Peattie, 2003) and credited with causing a \u201ccreeping commodification\u201d (Sturgeon, \n2014: 405) of public attitudes to health care (Pellegrino, 1999; Wildes, 1999).  In parallel, the \nchange in vocabulary whereby the patient has been reframed a \u2018health care consumer\u2019 and the \ndoctor as a \u2018health care provider\u2019 has also, according to Tomes (2006), led to an undermining of \nthe nature of the one-to-one doctor-patient relationship. Indeed the normalisation of the \nterminology implies that the health care consumer can simply go elsewhere and \u2018shop\u2019 in a \ndifferent place if they do not feel they are being well served.  It is easy to see how the shift to \nthe provider/consumer vocabulary in health care subtly undermines the idea of continuity of \ncare and the personal rapport that is assumed to be present in the doctor-patient relationship. \nCertainly many participants seemed to take it for granted that it was part of being a responsible \nhealth consumer to weigh up competing care options before deciding the best value for money \nin a particular situation.  For example, they would balance the cost of self-treatment with \nsupplements against the cost of a medical visit when they had an issue that they thought they \ncould treat themselves.  Vonnie had been used to a public insurance scheme for health cover in \nher home country, and considered \u201cthe cost of seeing a GP here is incredible\u201d.  She reported that \nshe found it cheaper to use supplements and herbal therapies as a preventive measure \u2013 in her \ncase for her reported tendency to depression \u2013 and for minor illnesses in her family.  Others \nweighed up more than the monetary cost, including time and convenience. Pharmacies and \n154 \n \n \nhealth stores, for example, gave free advice, there was no need to make an appointment and \nlittle or any waiting:    \n\u2026 well, it\u2019s cheaper.   It\u2019s probably cheaper to go and buy some supplements than it is to \nsit down with the doctor.  It\u2019s also quicker to whip in there and grab something and the \npace of life is quick.    (Bryony) \nBeing made more welcome and comfortable with a service was also something to weigh up \nagainst other options even if both were costly in monetary terms.  Olivia reported that she \npreferred to consult a herbalist for most health problems to avoid the unpleasant situations \nwhich she had encountered with medical services in the past, particularly when she had needed \ncare during weekends:     \nIt\u2019s expensive. \u2026  If I have to go in the weekend, maybe I can\u2019t afford do that and wait \nuntil next pay to eat so I might not pay it immediately.  I\u2019ve had arguments at the \ncounter with After Hours, saying I\u2019m not going to pay before I go in \u2026 you\u2019re going to \nhave to invoice me and it\u2019s caused a big [fuss]. Well why should that be a drama?  I\u2019ve \nsaid, look, I will pay your invoice but I can\u2019t pay today.  And that\u2019s not their policy.  It \ngoes completely against their policy.  So they had to go and ask the GP manager.  I know \nif I\u2019m doing something like that to get myself seen I know the majority of Pacific11 people \nin the world are not going to do that.  They\u2019re just going to go away, go home, they are \ngoing to stay in pain all weekend \u2013 or they might go to the hospital.  But I know that \nthat\u2019s a really dumb idea, so I don\u2019t want to do that.  \u2026it is so unpleasant and just causes \nyou another headache when you are weighing up the emotional cost, the monetary cost. \n(Olivia) \nThese criticisms of orthodox health care did not, however, make participants any more willing to \naccept poor treatment in the sphere of alternative health products and therapies.  They \nexpected equally high standards, perhaps because of the considerable costs, and were able to \nbring together their ideas of responsibility, their consumer skills and purchasing power to walk \naway from non-orthodox providers if they felt they had been taken advantage of, as this incident \nrelated by Molly demonstrates:  \n I went to the naturopath and then my brother did as well and we are different people \nand we got literally the same things\u2026.   I think that\u2019s what naturopaths should be about \n                                                          \n11 That is, of Pasifika ethnicity. \n155 \n \n \n\u2013 an individual person.  He took a photo of your eye up close and he was a bit of a fear \nmonger because \u2026he was looking at it and he was \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know how you ever walk \naround, man you must be so tired all the time.\u201d  And then of course then you go, actually \nI am quite tired.  And then after I walked out I thought, what a sucker.  I felt like he was \nthere to make money\u2026 But he hasn\u2019t done very well.  His business seems to have moved \nseveral times and it doesn\u2019t seem to go very well so I\u2019m not really too surprised. (Molly) \nThese comments and others made it clear that the participants had a well-honed sense of \nscepticism that they applied to buying any kind of product or service \u2013 health related or \notherwise - and they were fully able to mobilise their consumer skills when it came to deciding \nwhat supplements or alternative therapies they would buy.   \nReconfiguring responsibility: as a supplement seller \nAlmost all of the participants who sold supplements were engaged in balancing different types \nof responsibility within their business context.  Nearly all of them also spoke about their own \nsupplement use, but once they became sellers, their responsibilities had an additional layer of \ncomplexity. On the one hand they needed to become well informed about the full range of \nproducts they sold so that they could provide accurate guidance to their customers, but on the \nother, they needed to maintain the viability of their businesses and ensure they kept their \ncustomers coming to them rather than going elsewhere. While these two responsibilities were \naligned, they required more than simply being knowledgeable about their products and willing \nto pass on what they knew.  One of the pharmacists, for example, noted the importance of \nconsidering what their customers could afford and pricing products accordingly so that they \nwere offering good value.  She spoke about the benefits of joining with a group of pharmacies \nwho all sourced their products from the same supplier.  Through the group\u2019s purchasing power \nthey were able to reduce their own costs and offer discounting on supplements which made the \nprices more attractive to customers:       \nNatural health is definitely getting more affordable than it has been.  \u2026. being with a \ngroup \u2026   the price comes down significantly.  You get some really good prices for things \nthat previously would have been really expensive.  \u2026  Fish oil is an interesting example \nbecause they are a dime a dozen and basically from a price perspective people chop and \nchange between brands because of whatever\u2019s on special because it is going to do the \nsame thing.  (Jo) \n156 \n \n \nPat, one of the health store managers, openly discussed the commercial imperative needed to \nmaintain sales and therefore the viability of his business.  Without any prompting on my part, he \nspoke about the importance of his staff being both knowledgeable about the products they \nstocked but also to have commercial flair:     \nIt\u2019s not about selling for the sake of selling, it\u2019s what will complement what they want. So \nwhen they walk in, let\u2019s greet them \u2026don\u2019t pounce on them but \u201cOh how are you going, \nJohn? How are you going Sue?\u201d  You know, keep them engaged.  \u2026.  You\u2019ve got to be \nable to sell stuff.  Because how do you survive?   You survive based on your profit.  If \nyou\u2019re not making a profit you are not going to survive.  So they have to know how to \nsell.  (Pat) \nHe went on to speak enthusiastically about the extra services he offered to attract customers \nand give good value for money.  He noted that he stocked unique products; he prided himself on \nhis responsiveness to customer requests and inquiries, and the quick turnaround he provided for \nphone or email orders so that he retained their good will and future business.   The network \nmarketers too were quite open about the necessity of their work being financially worthwhile \nbut all of them also emphasised that they aimed to help others while also helping themselves:  \nSo initially my focus was creating a residual income \u2013 royalties for life \u2013 and then it \nchanged to helping people with health issues, challenges and chronic conditions. \n(Murray) \nSome seller participants largely skirted round the necessity of remaining commercially viable but \ninstead focused on their responsibility to take on the role of being an expert in supplements so \nthat they could care for and guide members of the public.  I did not interpret this as being a \nparticularly significant or deliberate omission; I had made it clear that my principal interest was \nin people\u2019s practices in relation to supplements and I did not question any of the providers about \nthe commercial side of their business. The existence of such a variety of well-established sellers \nand providers suggested that each of them had carved out a place in the market that appealed \nto and satisfied a particular group of clients and that they had mastered what was needed to \nremain in business.  Moreover, the commercial aspects of all these businesses were entirely \nconsistent with the neoliberal encouragement for economic activity. The fact that they provided \na source of products which were generally frowned on by official health care experts was just \nanother example of the different discourses and interests that are loosely tied together under \nneoliberal policy but interact in different configurations of power and resistance (Herrick, 2011).   \n157 \n \n \nFrom my discussions with the participants, it appeared that the combination of normative \nconsumer behaviour with its emphasis on choice and spending to support the economy, \ncombined with the critical awareness developed through taking responsibility for themselves \nhad brought them to the point where they were confident in their own expertise as \nknowledgeable consumers or sellers of supplements.  They had learnt to make judicious choices, \neven if, at times, by trial and error, and to navigate their way round the pressures of the \nsupplement and alternative health market.  For those who used supplements, it lessened their \nchances of spending money to no purpose and for those who sold supplements, it provided a \nfeeling of having a more secure and informed footing in the particular niche they occupied in the \ncommercial space.  How they had reached this level of self-direction where they were willing \nand able to challenge authorised wisdom about health was something that I explored directly \nwith the participants.  Their perceptions and practices are detailed in the following section.   \nBecoming your own expert \nAlmost all the participants were independent and avid seekers and users of health information \nwithin a continually evolving network of interconnecting online, print, and interpersonal sources.  \nThey drew from it but then in their turn added to it through interacting with others and sharing \ntheir experiences.  The key area that many focused on in our discussions was their ability to \ndiscover what they wanted to know by searching the internet:   \nYou can find information out about anything via the internet, so you know, people are \nchecking things out themselves, feeling like they want to be more \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 more \nin charge of their own health.  That it\u2019s not always about an expert.  That you are the \nexpert, to a certain extent\u2026Information \u2013 that whole \u201cinformation is power\u201d thing.  It\u2019s \nso much bigger now because we\u2019ve got so much access to a huge range of information \nthat wasn\u2019t as easily accessible in the past.  (Tessa) \nAs Tessa points out, there is a vast spectrum of resources that is now available to anyone who \ntakes the time to search for it.  She does not specify the kind of information that she was not \nable to access in the past, but appears to be referring to the advent and exponential growth of \nthe internet and the accompanying changes in technology which have democratised \u2018expert\u2019 \nmaterial to a large extent since the mid-1990s.  The Open Access movement for academic \npublications (Albert, 2006; Davis, 2011; Xia, 2010) has been a major change, allowing members \nof the public to find literature that was previously restricted to those in professional circles.  \nPerhaps even more significant have been the links provided by powerful search engines to the \n158 \n \n \nabstracts of expert material from databases such as Medline even if the full documents remain \nbehind paywalls. The result has been that knowledge which was once the exclusive preserve of \nhealth professionals is now more accessible for the lay public to access and interpret for \nthemselves. Moreover, thanks to the advantages of global internet coverage and intuitive user \ninterfaces both for publishing and accessing material, many other sources of information have \ndeveloped that provide commentary and opinion on health issues.  These cover a wide variety of \nperspectives, including those run by consumer health support groups, websites of companies \nthat market products, and unfiltered opinion pieces or personal stories from individual members \nof the public.   \nSome participants had well-established skills with online searching through their work or \ninterests elsewhere, while to others it was a novelty that they were still excited about as they \ndiscovered more and more.  Cliff, for example, had acquired his skills only recently as a direct \nresult of wanting to research the supplements he used and order them online.  Others such as \nBob appeared to take it for granted that they would look up anything they wanted to know \nabout supplements online and would be able to compare various opinions:  \n I looked up, when I first went on to glucosamine, that\u2019s how I knew it came from the \ngreen mussel and I\u2019ve read articles about it and of course you\u2019ve got the sceptics who \nthink that it doesn\u2019t do any good.  There\u2019s articles on that.   (Bob) \nThe participants clearly found that locating information and advice on health topics was a simple \nmatter.  They could get immediate access on virtually any topic, use what they read to develop \nideas of their own and decide whether to seek professional help or to treat themselves \nindependently. Moreover, even recent users, like Cliff, had quickly become aware that the \ninformation they found was variable and they need to treat it with caution:  \nAdvertising is huge into all that and a lot of these things, you know, if you can believe \neven ten percent of what you read, you\u2019ve got to take it with a grain of salt\u2026you\u2019ve really \ngot to be careful with the quality.   (Cliff) \nThe participants\u2019 positivity and confidence, however, is not generally shared by health \nprofessionals, who tend to take an opposite view.   \n It was recognised early in the era of widespread internet availability that the stream of \nunregulated and widely variable information presented an unprecedented challenge to \nmedicine\u2019s privileged status.  As early as 20 years ago, there was a realisation that this increased \n159 \n \n \navailability to health information had, in effect, ended the \u201cexclusive access to expert knowledge \nand the ability to define areas of expertise and practice\u201d (Hardey, 1999: 823) that had hitherto \nexisted.  By the mid-1990s, health professionals were already expressing concerns that losing \ntheir exclusive knowledge would see medicine become deprofessionalised as patients turned to \nonline sources of information and made their own decisions about what health care they \nneeded (Coiera, 1996).  More than two decades later, \u2018Dr Google\u2019 is here to stay (Lee et al., \n2014, 2017), a fact which no longer surprises health professionals, even if they only reluctantly \naccept its reality (Huovila & Saikkonen, 2016; Naghieh & Parvizi, 2016; Robertson et al., 2014).   \nAccording to Naghieh & Parvisi (2016:332) the availability of these widespread sources of \ninformation creates a \u201ccomplex medical predicament \u2026\u201d where consumers form their health \nknowledge from \u201cnon-medically sanctioned online information\u201d.  The same arguments about \nignorance and over-confidence  that put people \u2018at risk\u2019 are put forward, as have been \npreviously discussed (Fugh-Berman, 2000; Izzo & Ernst, 2009; Jefferies et al., 2012; Martinez et \nal., 2012; Mazzanti et al., 2008; Morris & Avorn, 2003; Stoneman et al., 2013).  There is also a \nbelief that people who consult online information or seek alternative therapies are more likely \nto under-report their use to their doctor (Hensrud et al., 1999; Wold et al., 2007), thereby \nundermining the supposedly better outcomes they might have gained by consulting a health \nprofessional, and increasing the risk of something serious being overlooked. The excerpt below \nis representative of the tone taken by the majority of these commentators:  \nArguably, consumers who possess the required operant resources and use e-health tools \nappropriately can become more engaged in effectively managing their own health.  \nUnfortunately however, the majority of consumers are resource deficient and have \ndifficulty effectively engaging with these online services\u2026[which is likely to] negatively \ninfluence consumer wellbeing \u2026 including consumers\u2019 disengagement with health care \nprofessionals.  (Robertson et al., 2014: 253) \nHowever, in the light of the discussions with the participants, these are simplistic explanations \nwhich overlook the nuances that underpin the relationship between patient and doctor.  They \nmiss the different frame of reference within which the participants were acting and the wider \nnetwork of interconnections that underpinned their actions; the complex interconnections \nbetween the material things they used, their ideas on naturalness and risk, and their intention to \ngenuinely \u2018self- manage\u2019 their health options rather than under the guidance and monitoring of a \nhealth professional (Bodenheimer et al., 2002).  Developing their own network of expertise was \na deliberate strategy that enabled them to resist being made fully and transparently visible as \n160 \n \n \ngoverned subjects (Hansen & Flyverbom, 2015) within the \u201csurveillant assemblage\u201d of orthodox \nmedicine (Haggerty & Ericson, 2000: 605).  \nWhile the impersonal sources of online expertise that they deliberately sought out were a \nprominent focus for participants, they also mentioned gathering information serendipitously \nfrom items they read or heard about, and talking to friends and family who could offer relevant \nadvice about supplements from their own experience.  Murray, for example, mentioned a friend \nand Rana a work colleague who had recommended products to try or people to ask for advice.  \nAlthough doctors tended to be avoided in their professional capacity, personal contacts with \nhealth professionals were valued even if their area of expertise was remote from anything to do \nwith the particular health issue. Bob, for example, made a special point of noting that a doctor \nacquaintance he knew slightly through his running group had directed him to a particular \nsupplement, but he had not mentioned anything of this to his own doctor.  Even those few \nparticipants who were not confident in their own judgement still preferred to outsource \nexpertise on supplements to anyone other than their doctor.   Jane was one who mentioned that \nshe found too much conflicting advice when she looked online herself and instead trusted the \nguidance of the alternative therapists she consulted:  \n\u2026most of the alternate medicines I take are through either naturopaths, reflexologists, \nchiropractors, or B [her kinesiologist].  (Jane) \nThe network marketers too, rather than become involved with researching information \nthemselves, tended to rely on the expertise claimed by their international companies, who, they \nreported, had their own teams of doctors and scientists:  \nSo that\u2019s the big thing for us \u2013 they do all the science so we don\u2019t have to. \u2026   I have met \nthem \u2013 they are amazing [original emphasis]. \u2026 they talked about the science behind the \nproducts (Molly) \nParticipants demonstrated, moreover, that they had become skilled at analysing and \nsynthesising the various threads of information on offer in the wide assemblage that was at their \ndisposal. They frequently sought advice from several sources before making a decision.  Before \ntrying a new supplement most would conduct their own online research first and then check it \nwith a pharmacist or health store staff member; others would seek advice first from a pharmacy \nor health store and then cross check themselves with online information:  \n161 \n \n \nI would probably look it up on the internet.  I would also speak to the pharmacist, but no \nmatter what I was purchasing I would look it up on the internet to see if there was any \ngood evidence, and wouldn\u2019t just take that advice.  Even though I went in and spoke to \nthe pharmacist about it, I still had to look it up for myself. (Penny) \nIn the same way as Penny, others mentioned that they assessed each situation on its own merits \nand considered the level of advice needed.  They spoke confidently about judging if and when \nthey needed to call on someone whom they judged more expert than themselves at interpreting \nconflicting advice that they had found:  \n\u2026 sometimes if it\u2019s something that I  think I don\u2019t really know enough about I\u2019d go  to the \nherbal dispensary and actually talk to a herbalist.  \u2026so in that case, I\u2019d definitely ask for \nadvice.  Other things \u2013 I read a lot about what works and what doesn\u2019t work, so I do read \nstuff, because there have been more and more trials of supplements, so I definitely look \nall that up, look all that stuff up, so I try to make an informed choice, I suppose.  (Tessa) \nBoth Tessa and Penny talk about \u2018trials\u2019, and \u2018evidence\u2019, implying, though not directly stating \nthat they have internalised and accepted, at least to some extent, the value of scientific \northodoxy about evidence of effectiveness,  (i.e. what works).  They both \u2018look up\u2019 and find what \nthey want, constructing themselves as well informed and independent consumers but also speak \nabout getting additional opinions as confirmation if they have any uncertainty about their \ndecision. \u2018Expert\u2019 advice is not necessarily rejected, but is also brought into consideration.  Then \nall of these threads are gathered together to compile their personal assemblage of expertise.  \nOther investigators have also shown that people gather together \u2018hybrids\u2019 of \u201cexperiential \nexpertise\u201d (Castro et al., 2019) from multiple sources that they trust to make decisions about \ntheir health.  These bodies of personal expertise, in the same way as those the participants \nspoke of, form a challenge to orthodox medicine because they are \u201cnot readily visible and \ntherefore not readily disciplined\u201d (Dew et al., 2014: 29).  \nWhile very different from one another, an important characteristic that all participants shared \nwas being willing to be \u201cundisciplined patients\u201d (Keshet & Popper-Giveon, 2018) who \nconsciously chose to be active health consumers rather than \u2018patients\u2019.12  Being aware that their \ndoctor was likely to disapprove if they did mention the supplements they took was a disincentive \nto enter into discussion on the topic and there was usually no need to. As Paul remarked, \u201cI \nimagine that a long discussion with him [his doctor] would probably produce the result that, no, I \n                                                          \n12 The word \u2018patient\u2019 is derived from the Latin passive verb patior meaning I suffer.   \n162 \n \n \nwouldn\u2019t recommend that.\u201d  Those who had mentioned their supplement use might be \nreprimanded as Frances had been:  \nHe said, well you are probably very silly to have done that because you just don\u2019t know.  \nYou have to be careful. (Frances) \nRather than being told they were \u2018silly\u2019, they were more likely to avoid the issue altogether, \nactively choosing to obscure some of their practices from becoming questioned and contested. \nThey were then free to decide what to do or not to do without comment from a professional; \ntheir purchases did not have to be recorded against dispensing data or their health records and \nthey did not need to be checked on to see if they were \u2018adherent\u2019 as is the case with prescribed \nmedicines (N\u00e1fr\u00e1di et al., 2016).  Moreover, as their experience of supplement use grew and \nthey gained more confidence and expertise about them, the participants reported that they \nbelieved their doctor would not necessarily know more than they did, even if they did ask them \nfor advice:  \nWell, personally I feel that the doctors \u2013 not being disrespectful \u2013 but to be honest, they \ndon\u2019t have any training in nutrition and diet. (Pat) \nOther participants too had found that doctors usually prescribed a drug as the first option and \nwere unlikely to give advice on alternatives:  \n  I think drugs have got their place but I just feel it would be nice if alternatives were \noffered, were pushed as much as medication is.  \u2026  I don\u2019t particularly want to move the \ngirls and myself to a practice that just does natural medicine because I think that swings \ncompletely the other way so yes, I just feel that it\u2019s not very well balanced perhaps in \nterms of the advice you get.  (Penny) \nThe perceptions of the generally poor knowledge of health professionals about the use of \nalternatives and their unwillingness to enter into discussions about them was not unique to the \nstudy participants but is consistent with studies done elsewhere (Chang & Wang, 2009; Eliason \net al., 1999; Humpel & Jones, 2006; Peters et al., 2003; Reedy et al., 2005; Vickers et al., 2006).  \nThe point is not so much whether any piece of information that consumers come across is right \nor wrong, scientifically based or not, \u2018objective\u2019 or commercially biased (Schwitzer et al., 2005) \nbut that they all exist and all make use of up-to-date communication strategies to disseminate \ntheir particular version of expertise and therefore extend their influence.  The sheer variety of \nthe information and the way it is interpreted undermines the idea that there can ever be one \n163 \n \n \nauthorised, stable version of expertise held by an all-knowing medical profession (Annas & Elias, \n1999; Waxman 2005). Given this plethora of conflicting information about health and medicine, \nit does not seem surprising that some consumers may \u2018tune out\u2019 official advice and take their \nown steps to become informed.   \nIndeed, several participants mentioned that they made use of their personal expertise as \nanother type of counter-conduct to reverse the surveilling gaze (Ganesh, 2016) and scrutinise \nthe experts themselves:    \nSusan: If you decided to take something would you look it up on the internet first to see? \nFrances:  Oh, yes I would.  Even sometimes if I am given a prescription I will look up \nsometimes what it is. \nA particular trigger which generated \u2018counter conduct\u2019 and the resistance to orthodox expertise \namong participants was what they referred to as being \u2018fobbed off\u2019.  This expression was used by \na number of participants as a way of capturing their frustration about their need for a problem \nto be taken seriously by their doctor but receiving only a disappointing and dismissive response:  \nI had irritable bowel and basically got fobbed off by the doctors as you would imagine so \nI went to a naturopath, changed the way I ate and changed my lifestyle and took on \nboard a lot of the common sense suggestions that she made at the time. Some that you \nprobably already know yourself but you have got too lazy to do any more. (Trudy) \nIt is interesting here how Trudy comments \u201cas you would imagine\u201d underlining her low \nexpectations of the medical profession.  Others too expressed frustration at aspects of medical \ntreatment they had received.  Wendy felt that she had been disregarded as an individual, being \n\u201cthrown statins or whatever the drug of choice is\u201d and Olivia was even more emphatic, speaking \nabout being \u201cdisempowered\u201d by the \u201cextreme, awful experiences with people working in health\u201d.    \nThe participants\u2019 independent actions were directly in contrast to the concept of \u2018patient \nempowerment\u2019 through shared decision making, an approach that is promoted for people with \nchronic disease so that they become able to better \u2018self-mange\u2019 their conditions (Elwyn et al., \n2012; Nolte & Osborne, 2013; Schulman-Green et al., 2012). This approach is presented as \nhanding over power to the patient (not referred to here as a health consumer), who will then \nachieve \u2018activation\u2019 and \u2018engagement\u2019 in their own care, leading to better outcomes and fewer \nhealth care costs (Brady et al., 2013; Nolte & Osborne, 2013; Powers et al., 2015).  The \ndiscourses around self-management construct the patient as receiving expert advice on the \n164 \n \n \ncorrect behaviours to adopt and why they will benefit, and therefore being motivated to carry \nout what is recommended, clearly reflecting that Foucauldian concept of the autonomous \nsubject and the conduct of conduct (Andreassen & Trondsen, 2010; Veitch, 2010).  Any reading \nof the literature, however, demonstrates the underlying assumption that the doctor is in charge \nbut the patient takes on the responsibility of doing what they are told.  Salmon and Hall argue \nthat constructing patients in this way allows the doctor to withdraw from the \u201cproblematic \nresponsibilities\u201d (2003: 1971) presented by people with chronic illness and that the approach is \nmore likely to disempower patients rather than offer them control.  In contrast, the participants\u2019 \nversion of self-management, in which they were highly engaged, needed no authorisation or \ninstruction from an expert. \nNevertheless, none of the participants, no matter what their previous experiences, had turned \naway entirely from mainstream health care when they believed it was appropriate.   The \nconcerns raised in the literature, particularly the idea that consumers who treat themselves with \nsupplements will fail to seek treatment for serious conditions (Robertson et al., 2014) were \nsimply not borne out in this study.  All participants were very aware that self-care could only be \nused up to a point and that there were times when the expertise and professional training of \nhealth professionals was essential:  \nI am very grateful that there is a whole medical environment out there in case of \nemergency, serious stuff, but I would also have to say that we keep getting letters from \nthe doctor saying \u201cAre you still enrolled, because we haven\u2019t seen you for three years\u201d \n(Catherine) \nIn Foucauldian terms, they were willing to submit to being \u2018conducted\u2019 and their bodies opened \nto the gaze of the health professions in some situations when they considered it appropriate, \nbut it would be their own, active decision to do so.  They did not appear to have any difficulty in \nmaking the distinction between such cases and the routine, chronic, or simply annoying \nconditions that they believed they could confidently look after themselves:  \nI mean, obviously it\u2019s a bit different when you are thinking about diagnosing cancer and \nall of that stuff, but there are things you can work out for yourself.  (Tessa) \nIt may seem an obvious point that serious or emergency conditions need orthodox medicine, \nand that self-care or alternatives are suitable only for less serious conditions but it is worth \nhighlighting that this group of participants, at least, believed they were able to make the \ndistinction.  Seen in this way, not raising their supplement use with their doctor was also likely to \n165 \n \n \nbe driven by the practicality of avoiding unsettling an ongoing and positive relationship which \nthey knew they may need in the future.     \nThe participants not only balanced orthodox care against their own self-care alternative \nbehaviour, but were willing to \u2018shop around\u2019 for a doctor that suited them.  They were cognisant \nthat there was a spectrum of views within the ranks of health professionals and were able to use \nthis variation to their own advantage.   One enterprising participant reported that in addition to \nhis own self-care practices, he consulted two different doctors in different parts of town to \nachieve the balance of orthodox and alternative health care he felt was most appropriate \ndepending on the particular circumstances:    \nI\u2019ve got one doctor there but I\u2019ve got a doctor out here as well.  The one at [name of \nintegrative practice] will treat me naturally because he knows who I am but it got to the \npoint that something I was dealing with \u2013 try this and try that, it\u2019s not working. \u2026 I took \nthe antibiotic, I got myself right then I went back to him \u2026 and I have been good ever \nsince.    At some point you can\u2019t keep saying bean sprouts and garlic juice will fix it \nbecause it may not fix it, so you hit it hard. (Pat) \nAs individuals are not able to be enrolled in two practices at once in the New Zealand system, \nPat must have been prepared to pay the extra costs that unenrolled patients attract for some of \nhis consultations, but appears to have felt it was worthwhile.  Other participants also spoke \nabout weighing up what they would tolerate and what was unacceptable in a medical provider.  \nDevon, a herbalist, for example, had a neutral approach to selecting a doctor but had a \u2018bottom \nline\u2019 in that she would not deal with anyone \u201cwho openly antagonises the idea of using herbal \nmedicine, which doesn\u2019t really happen so much anymore\u201d.   Moreover, all participants were \nwilling to exercise consumer behaviour and take their \u2018custom\u2019 elsewhere if they were \nunsatisfied with the service they received:  \nI changed medical practice because I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the doctor that I was seeing. \u2026 \nI wasn\u2019t getting anywhere with the other fellow and I said to [current doctor] I\u2019ve got \nthis, this and this and he sorted it all out.  (Murray) \nIt was clear here that Murray believed he knew what his diagnosis was and had decided in this \nparticular case, self-care was not appropriate.  He was calling on a doctor with an appropriate \nlevel of expertise to \u201csort it out\u201d and was prepared to move from one practice to another to find \none.  Murray does not say why he believed he was \u201cnot getting anywhere\u201d and at the time I \nspoke to him I did not follow up on the reason.  It is unclear whether he had lost confidence in \n166 \n \n \nthe \u201cother fellow\u2019s\u201d competence, or whether he felt that he was not being listened to and his \nconcerns \u2018fobbed of\u2019 as other participants called it.  In any case, he, like the participants above, \nknew what level of expertise he wanted and was prepared to use his resources to engage what \nhe judged was necessary.   Being willing to switch between health providers requires a degree of \nassertiveness to declare oneself a dissatisfied \u2018customer\u2019 from that particular practice and being \nprepared to accept the potential bad feeling and emotional cost it may involve in explaining \noneself to get one\u2019s medical records transferred elsewhere.   As Rose (1996) writes, the \nconjunction of individuals seeking to have improved quality of life and professionals claiming to \nprovide objective rational answers, is an alliance:  \nThe mechanism of this alliance is the market, the \u2018free\u2019 exchange between those with a \nservice to sell and those who have been brought to want to buy (156-157).  \nTerminating the relationship with a doctor in a \u201cpatient walk out\u201d (Stokes et al., 2004: 512) as \nhappened with Murray, is a signal to the provider that this alliance has broken down.   The \nwillingness of participants to assert themselves in this way also demonstrated the confidence \nthat they gained through their growing expertise in deciding what health care options they \nwould use and under what circumstances.    \nSo far the discussion has focused on individual expertise and decisions about selecting personal \ncare options.  Considerably more complex is the position of those who offer their expertise as \nsellers of supplements and advice on how to use them.  They comprise a network of \n\u2018alternatives\u2019 that ranges from the pharmacists, on the one hand, who are credentialed as part \nof the orthodox health system to those whose expertise is based only on their own claims to \nknow more than the general public.   This space is busy, even cluttered, and hotly competitive \nwith a diverse collection of providers all claiming various types of expertise that can help \nindividuals.   They compete not only with one another but also with orthodox medicine, \ndemonstrating once again the tensions at work in the neoliberal economy which, though it \nofficially endorses the primacy of \u2018experts\u2019 in orthodox medicine, also upholds a parallel universe \nof economic opportunities for marketing alternatives even if they be counter to the orthodox \nline.   A number of the participants in the study were directly engaged as \u2018alternative providers\u2019 \nas well as consumers in this market and therefore had perspectives on expertise from both \nangles.  The next section looks at how being on the other side of the consumer/provider divide \naffected their practices and the range of conduct and counter-conduct that they too were able \nto mobilise in their position.   \n167 \n \n \nBecoming expert enough to advise others   \nAmong the participants there were pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, health store managers, \nand those who offered different modalities of alternative therapy.  They were a diverse group, \nbut had two noticeable characteristics in common.  Firstly, all of them ultimately made their \nliving from marketing their products, expertise, or both. Secondly, that once on the other side of \nthe customer/provider divide, all of them were convinced that the public needed their advice.  \nEach of them offered a different \u2018assemblage\u2019 of orthodox and non-orthodox expertise which \nthey used to justify their claim to the particular section of the public \u2013 and the market \u2013 that \nthey advised.  \nThe pharmacists were the most \u2018expert\u2019 in biomedical terms, but arguably also the most likely to \nhave difficulty balancing their practice with alternative health products so it did not conflict with \ntheir role in dispensing medicines prescribed by a doctor.  Pharmacists are considered to be a \nkey part of the primary health care team (Lloyd et al., 2010; Smith, 2012).  They rely on the \ndoctors whose prescriptions they dispense having confidence in their expertise and \nprofessionalism, but are generally seen as lower in the health hierarchy compared to the doctor \nin spite of their greater knowledge of pharmaceuticals (Bradley et al., 2018; Hughes & McCann, \n2003; Weiss & Sutton, 2009).  Their position has been somewhat unflatteringly compared to that \nof \u2018sheepdogs\u2019 by Waring and Latif (2018) who drew from Foucault\u2019s work on pastoral power, to \nsuggest that:    \n\u2026 the docile patient (sheep) [is] herded and checked by the pharmacist (sheepdog) and \n\u2026  both patient and pharmacist are supervised and directed from a distance by the GP \n(shepherd)  (Waring and Latif, 2017: 8).  \nAll pharmacists in the study referred to their biomedical training and put it forward as the \nspecial level of expertise they could offer to the individuals who came to their premises seeking \nadvice. In addition, they noted that they were able to access the records of all medicines that \ntheir regular customers had been prescribed by doctors, and therefore they were able to \nprovide an extra level of safety regarding possible interactions.  They largely avoided negative \ndepictions of their customers as poorly informed and focused much more on the positive advice \nthey could offer.  As the following excerpt shows, however, there were a number of underlying \ntensions in their role:   \nIf I put my hand on my heart and say I\u2019m a white coat health professional \u2013 which I \nconsider myself \u2013 that\u2019s part of what makes me who I am, then I think we are going to \n168 \n \n \nrun the risk of actually not helping patients if we say, I don\u2019t actually know about that \n[supplements/herbal medicines]. \u2026we do need to know what we are talking about and I \ndo actually think that some of the natural health products do have a lot of validity. \u2026by \nusing natural health people see that they can do that without the middle man.  But at \ntimes that\u2019s where exactly it is crucial to have a middle man such as a pharmacist \nbecause the reality is it is not quite as straightforward \u2013 you know \u2013 this should work for \nthis or this may work for this so I will take that. (Jo) \nMuch is implied in this comment.  There is an initial alignment by this pharmacist with orthodox \nexpertise, and one that deals with \u2018patients\u2019 rather than consumers.  However, because these \n\u2018patients\u2019 do come directly to the pharmacy, and avoid the \u2018middle man\u2019 (i.e. the doctor), we \n(now speaking on behalf of pharmacist colleagues in general), cannot opt out of giving informed \nadvice.  Instead, they have a responsibility to occupy the position of the expert intermediary, \noffering advice directly to people who come to them for guidance, not on behalf of a doctor (as \nthey do with prescribed medicines), but directly.  All the pharmacists interviewed in the study \npositioned themselves in this way as being responsible and knowledgeable experts needed by \nmembers of the public to steer them in the right direction with the correct use of supplements \nand herbal medicines.    \nThe information is available there but is the person qualified to understand the \ninformation?  \u2026this is where I have always believed in pharmacy \u2026So if somebody wants \nto go down that track [researching their own information] they actually need someone \nwho\u2019s qualified. (Jordan) \nBoth Jo and Jordan are enacting a form of counter conduct to the \u2018sheepdog\u2019 role who merely \nchases up the sheep when the shepherd instructs them.  As Waring and Latif (2017) note, there \nare tensions in the relationship between doctors and pharmacists and the latter may resent the \nway that they are viewed as someone who is merely there to carry out what is delegated to \nthem by a \u2018superior\u2019 profession. These include comments about pharmacists which discount \ntheir professional qualifications and refer to them as \u2018shopkeepers\u2019 (Hughes & McCann, 2003),  \nor compare them to \u201cfirms that sell computers or mobile phones\u201d (Clarke, 2014: 148).  They all \nreported taking on the role of the shepherd by \u2018prescribing\u2019 directly when they were asked for \nhelp, and, in doing so, they were by implication, also distancing themselves from the authorised \nview that supplements are largely unnecessary and/or ineffective:    \n169 \n \n \nWhat are you going to give the woman who is four weeks pregnant?  What are you \ngoing to do for the 97 year old frail 47 kilo lady who is on 17 medications?   \u2026  Are you \njust going to say, sorry love, go home and put up with the symptoms because I have \nnothing to give you. (Jordan) \nAll these excerpts from pharmacists appeared to be drawing on the concept that pharmacists \nhave a duty to give \u2018best advice\u2019 according to their professional judgement (Roche & Kelliher, \n2014).  Pharmacists also commented on issues around the sufficiency of evidence, noting that \nlevels of \u2018evidence\u2019 derived from trials were not clear cut and had been challenged in orthodox \nmedicine itself (Ioannidis, 2008; Kennedy-Martin et al., 2015).  Lyndsay remarked in particular on \nthe blurriness around how much evidence was needed to be sufficient:    \nSo it\u2019s not black and white; it\u2019s pretty grey.  And so, I mean what\u2019s acceptable evidence if \nyou\u2019ve got something that has a series of positive double blind studies involving a \nreasonable number of people that have been positive.  Is that acceptable evidence?  Or \ndo you need a meta-analysis involving 100,000 people.  Glucosamine is a classic example \nof that in that originally there were quite a large number of positive studies and then \nthere is a meta-analysis but then the meta-analysis can be criticised as well.  So often \nevidence is pretty murky on its own.  (Lyndsay) \nPharmacists were also aware, however, that their orthodox training had not prepared them for \nthe position that they found themselves in between needing to know enough about \nsupplements to answer the requests for advice they received, yet in doing so they faced the \ngeneral disapproval of their medical colleagues whose prescriptions they dispensed.   Kerry, a \npharmacy technician pointed out that the perception of superior expertise of pharmacists about \nsupplements was not necessarily well founded: \nThey [pharmacists] don\u2019t know any more.  They know more about the [prescribed] drugs \nbut they have had no training [in other products]. But because they are the pharmacist \nthey are seen to have that \u2013 look I am not dissing them \u2013 it\u2019s their responsibility at the \nend of the day.  (Kerry) \nAll of the pharmacists had taken steps to learn more but it appeared they got no help from their \nown professional association and had to turn elsewhere to become more knowledgeable.  One \nof them mentioned he was completing an international qualification in natural medicines and \nothers had found that the product companies were the most readily available source for \nupskilling themselves:  \n170 \n \n \nWell at the beginning I felt quite ignorant about it.  \u2026.  I thought, this is silly because I \nshould be able to at least give them [customers/patients] an account or know where to \nlook properly to find some good information for them.  \u2026  So we then, with the suppliers \nthat we were dealing with \u2026they linked me up with seminars that were going on with \none of the companies to look at certain aspects of alternative medicines for a particular \ncondition or conditions.  (Lou) \nSo the pharmacists, too, were drawing from an evolving assemblage of expertise, adding to their \northodox training, their many interactions with the public, the feedback they received, the \ninformation from product companies, and, for some who were willing to discuss it, their own \nexperience with taking the products. They undertook these educational activities outside their \nusual realm at the risk of attracting the negative discourse that pharmacists have often received \nas suppliers of supplements and herbal products.   \nA different situation existed for those participants who offered alternative therapies in \nacupuncture, homeopathy, and medical herbalism, all of whom also either provided or \nrecommended supplements to their clients.  Each of them had a New Zealand recognised \nqualification in the modality they practised, but were not eligible to practise within the public \nhealth system.13  This, however, avoided the tension faced by pharmacists in maintaining \nworking relationships with orthodoxy.  They simply presented themselves as well qualified in \ntheir modality and able to offer an alternative to the biomedical approach to anyone who \nwished to consult them and was able to pay for it.  They did, however, share the view of the \nother providers that members of the public could go astray without their guidance:  \nI believe that people often will have an idea of what might be good for them or what \nmight work for them.  I see that as an OK thing to do in the short term.  I see that \nproblems start happening when people decide to take something and then they take it \nfor five years\u2013 the same supplement for maybe five years \u2013 and they\u2019ve got these really \nunusual symptoms   because they\u2019ve taken the supplement for such a long time that \nthey\u2019ve made some kind of disharmony in the body\u2026 (Bryony) \nThe three participants who managed health stores were different again.  None was able to call \non the same level of officially approved educational or orthodox health expertise as the \n                                                          \n13 The Accident Compensation Commission (ACC) does fund acupuncture, chiropractic and osteopathy \ntreatments, but these are limited to people who meet the accidental injury criteria (ACC 2019), and have \ntreatment from a therapist that ACC has approved \n171 \n \n \npharmacists or alternative therapists.  However, they all made unprompted comments assuring \nme of the wealth of resources they drew on for support.  They reported that they or someone \non their staff had undertaken training either through their parent company, or they employed a \nstaff member who was qualified in one of the alternative modalities, usually herbalism. More \nthan the other \u2018seller\u2019 participants, they went into detail, emphasising their awareness of \ninteractions between supplements and prescription drugs, their protocols for questioning \npeople about the prescribed medicines they took and the references they kept on hand.  They \nstressed their readiness to refer outside the business, for example, to medical herbalists, if they \nwere unsure of what to advise and believed customers should get a second opinion.    \nWe pride ourselves and [name of business] on giving people accurate information based \non research.  (Pat) \nTheir seemingly over-emphatic reaction appeared to me to be a way of constructing themselves \nas running a serious, well-informed, ethically sound, and responsible business, possibly in an \nunspoken acknowledgement of the unfavourable way health stores are often portrayed in the \nacademic literature as being profit-driven providers of poor advice (Coon et al., 2015; Gotay & \nDumitriu, 2000; Sarino et al., 2007; Temple et al., 2009).  A particular aspect that the health \nstore providers mentioned was their special niche in providing hope for those who felt let down \nby the orthodox health system and had \u2018given up\u2019 believing that they would get any help except \nfrom sources they explored themselves:    \n Very, very rarely do people with serious illnesses and long term health problems, very \nrarely do they come and see us first.  (Bernie) \nPat and Lesley also made comments in a similar vein, with Lesley suggesting that people had lost \nfaith in conventional treatment:     \n  They\u2019re not actually getting the fix that they initially thought they should get from the \ndoctors.  Once upon a time he was God; he knew how to fix it. (Lesley) \nThis overt use of religious imagery recalled the notion of the doctor as the shepherd or pastor \nthat was noted earlier (Jones, 2018; Waring & Latif, 2018) and the vacuum in guidance that the \nhealth stores presented themselves as being able to fill.  An interesting feature of the health \nstore managers was their uniformly low opinion of the public\u2019s ability to know what was good \nfor them and that they, as health store managers, needed to step in and provide their greater \nlevel of expertise:   \n172 \n \n \nNo health shop likes the internet.  We hate it with a passion \u2026. It\u2019s hugely frustrating \n\u2026.people walk in with bags of stuff they\u2019ve bought off the internet and they\u2019re going for \nan operation in two days and they say I\u2019ve been taking this, and this \u2013 and it\u2019s completely \nwrong what they\u2019ve been taking.  I wish they could turn it [the internet] off sometimes. \n(Bernie) \nEven though all those who provided advice on supplements felt that the public needed a degree \nof guidance from them, the health store managers were by far the most emphatic in their \ninsistence that people would go astray without their help.  Their comments appeared to fall back \non precisely the same discourse as that used by orthodox medicine; the construction of the \ngeneral public as an ignorant bloc, who were \u2018at risk\u2019, and needed to be more \u2018disciplined\u2019 and \nsubmit to their guidance.  I interpreted this an attempt by the health store managers to counter \nthe perceptions of them as being commercially motivated (Temple, 2012), emphasise their \naltruistic intentions and shore up their own place in the provision of expertise. In contrast, the \npharmacists and alternative therapists, who also believed that their customers needed their \nguidance, were much more positive about them and did not speak about them in such strongly \nnegative terms.    \nIn summing up this section on expertise, its principal characteristic was just how complex and \ngenerally \u2018messy\u2019 it was.  The participants\u2019 accounts showed that the care options they chose \nwere \u201cdispersed, heterogeneous and variegated\u201d (Death, 2010: 235) not a binary opposition of \nalternative versus orthodox care. All participants readily mixed both, drawing from their own \nexperiences and background knowledge derived over their life to this point.  They used diverse \nsources of information they could call on through online searching, media and advertising, then \nadded in what they learned from people they came across, and combined it all with their first \nhand experiences of the products they took. The convenient dichotomies of expert versus lay, \nnormative versus non-normative, orthodox versus alternative, or care versus commerce were \nblurred; all participants bridged and muddled these divides and moved beyond them to a state \nwhere each of them had developed their own assemblage of expertise that was relevant to their \nown unique context.  Moreover, the interconnections in the assemblage around their \nsupplement practices that had led to the participants developing their new skills and knowledge \nhad become woven into their process of \u2018becoming\u2019 as they moved through their life journey.  \n\u2018Becoming\u2019 is an active, creative process, driven by the \u201ccapacity to form new relations and the \ndesire to do so\u201d (Buchanan, 1997: 83) and it creates the conditions for ongoing identity \nformation, (Fox and Ward (2008), as the next section explores.  \n173 \n \n \nSupplements and evolving identity  \nWhen they spoke about supplements, the participants provided many examples of their own \nprocesses of \u2018becoming\u2019, the unexpected twists and turns during their lives, the multitude of \ninterconnected but unplanned relations that they had formed with people and things, and that \nwere continually evolving and changing.  Their accounts demonstrated the unpredictability of \nthe connections that take place in a person\u2019s life and their capacity \u201c\u2026to form new relations and \nin turn enable other new relations\u201d (Buchanan, 1997:82), as their life progressed.  The chance \nencounters and the variety of incidents that had proved to be influential reflected the \nrandomness of the rhizomatic assemblage with its many connections \u201calways branching and \ntwisting, in flux and reassembling in different ways\u201d(Fox, 2012: 67).   Each of the participants\u2019 \nstories as they explained how crucial events in their lives had unfolded contrasted with \u201cthe \nmodern fantasy of the body as a stable, unified, bounded entity\u201d (Malins, 2004: 85).  Their \naccounts revealed the constant developments that come about in people\u2019s lives, the many \nconnections that they make and the decisions they take to follow one path or another.   \nSections of Bob\u2019s story showed how this could happen.  Bob had been involved in competitive \nrunning for more than 50 years, ever since he had been singled out for special running coaching \nas a schoolboy.  At a point in his fifties (he was now almost 70), he started to find running was \nbecoming more difficult:    \n \u2026your legs start to react especially when you are in your mid 50s and then I gave up \nrunning on the track and I was still running and then I was thinking, oh, my running is \ncoming to an end and I don\u2019t want it to.  I want to keep on going.  And for about three \nmonths I felt I was going to have to give up.  I was so stiff and not feeling too good at all, \nhobbling when I am running \u2013 didn\u2019t have a specific injury but my legs were very, very \ntight.  (Bob) \nAfter his decades\u2019 long participation in running, it was clearly an important activity for Bob and \npart of his identity was that he was \u2018a runner\u2019.  Being faced with losing this part of himself set \nhim off on a line of flight when a chance conversation at a church service with a passing \nacquaintance alerted him to the possibility of taking glucosamine for his joints as his informant \nwas \u201csure it worked\u201d.  The random interaction with this person set off a series of actions where \nhe formed new connections with different people, places and things.  Some were deliberate and \nplanned; he did his own research online, noting that he read a spectrum of opinions, articles by \n\u201csceptics\u201d as well as those that were positive. Through his decision to buy the glucosamine he \n174 \n \n \nfound a pharmacy where he believed he received trustworthy advice, and owing to the repeat \nbusiness he brought, he now received a discount on his products. Other connections were quite \nrandom; he chanced to hear from a different acquaintance, a doctor stationed with the US Navy \nin their base in New Zealand, who told him that fish oil was also \u201cgreat for the joints and it \nlubricates the eyes\u201d.  This was an important connection in another and completely unexpected \ndirection; Bob\u2019s father had gone blind at the end of his life and Bob thought it was likely to be \nhereditary, so he was drawn to the idea fish oil may help him in both ways.  He had added fish \noil to the glucosamine, and since then made refinements to his supplement regime, taking more \nbefore a competitive event or a planned long run, but otherwise a little less.  Through all this he \nbelieved he had been able to retain his identity as a runner that he feared he might lose, and \nkeep his body fit for what he wanted to do.  He also commented that being able to do so had \nreduced his stress and \u201ckept me mentally sound \u2026That\u2019s the odd thing.  You go for a run, instead \nof being tired, you actually power up\u201d.   \nThe aptness of the rhizome metaphor is shown here through Bob\u2019s narrative.  Its multiple \nconnections with people that passed unexpectedly in and out of his acquaintance, pieces of \ninformation they happened to mention by chance that they did not know would be important to \nhim, the non-human actors that were part of the overall story - the information modalities, the \nmaterial substances he took, and even the loyalty card that he had at his favourite pharmacy.  \nThese were all part of the evolving direction of the lines of flight as they twisted and turned; the \nchance discovery about eye health, and the optimism he reported about his future mental and \nphysical health that had kept him moving in an away direction from the blockage he had come \nup against in his desire to keep running.  Tracy, similarly, described in moving terms how her \nback pain had become an unwanted presence, dominating her life and stopping her doing what \nshe wanted to:   \n  All I wanted to do was to go for a run. \u2026.  I was feeling so frustrated and I just wanted to \ncry all the time.  I still actually \u2013 the thought of it makes me cry again because I was so \nmiserable\u2026 (Tracy)  \nThe continuation of her story into better times, like Bob\u2019s, illustrated the role that \ninterconnections with people and things had played for her, reinvigorating her with the desire to \ntake action, keep evolving, or in the language of the rhizome, to continue \u2018becoming\u2019.  Illness, \nwrote Deleuze (1997: 228), is not a process but the stopping of the process of becoming.  It is a \n\u201cstate into which we fall\u201d.   In contrast to this stoppage:  \n175 \n \n \nBecoming begins as a desire to escape bodily limitation.  Whether the constraint in \nquestion is generally characterized as a \u2018natural\u2019 or \u2018cultural\u2019 necessity makes little \ndifference. \u2026  What matters is that the constraint is there, and there is a counterdesire \n[sic] to leave it behind (Massumi, 1992: 94).  \nThis counter desire was a recurrent theme in all the discussions I had with the participants; their \ndesire to do rather than just be, to be active, to avoid their lives becoming stuck in a place where \nthey were centred on the limitations imposed by pain or dysfunction.  Some of them were just \nsmall vignettes that presupposed a long background story which would have taken much time to \nrelate. Interestingly, most participants could recall the precise event that connected them with \nthe supplement assemblage and in most cases it was because of a physical or mental health \nproblem which threatened to create a blockage in their life that would undermine their identity.  \nJane, for example, recalled the precise moment when, after an unsatisfactory medical \nencounter, she made the decision to turn away from accepting that she was always going to be a \nmedical problem (Shilling, 2002) and actively seek out other options, noting that \u201cI am prepared \nto experiment if there is nothing to lose\u201d.  Such situations were presented as a turning point in \nparticipants\u2019 lives, where they realised that they had an opportunity to assume control over \ncircumstances, explore other avenues that were open to them and find other possibilities on \nwhich they could act.    \nThese encounters where there was a chance to grasp an opportunity that offered or allow it to \npass by, also featured among those who provided advice to the public.  All the pharmacists \nspoke about being confronted with situations where they felt the tension between remaining \nstrictly within their formal training or branching out beyond the orthodox response.  Jo found \nshe was not able to opt out of helping people who asked for advice about alternative products \nand say \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that\u201d.  Lou similarly reported he was driven to learn more \nbecause he felt \u201cquite ignorant\u201d and \u201csilly\u201d when people asked for his advice. According to their \naccounts, these opportunities had led down a line of flight that opened up a different world view \nbeyond their professional training, even if they set off down that road as a sceptic:   \nIf you\u2019ve got someone that is addicted to sleeping pills \u2026   which is better?  Either going \nto the GP and getting prescribed something that may result in a life-time addiction, or \nget some placebo which might just help them think they are going to get a good night\u2019s \nsleep and actually does.  And they help.  (Lyndsay) \n176 \n \n \nMany others in the study referred in a similar way to a point where there had taken up an \nopportunity to learn, to change, to take on a different world view, to become rather than \nremaining the same.  They had experienced:  \n\u2026 a tension between two modes of desire \u2013 being and becoming; sameness and \ndifference.  At the point of departure from the constraint, there is a \u2018bifurcating future\u2019 \nand a choice whether to fall back into the one or to set out instead on a singular path of \nbecoming, leading into undreamed of horizons (Massumi 1992: 95).   \nComing up against a barrier that affects what their body can do \u2018deterritorialises\u2019 people \n(Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 9), figuratively, cutting the ground from under their feet, and \nmoving their sense of self from autonomy to dependency (Fox 2012: 78).  Being diagnosed with \na chronic disease or becoming disabled even in the medium term through accident or injury \nthreatens to disrupt  how they envisaged their future unfolding (Morden et al., 2017; Williams, \n2000).  They may lose the ability to engage in sport or other activities which are part of their \nidentity and their opportunities for social contact with others are narrowed (Theou et al., 2017).  \nThey may no longer be able to get themselves independently to where they want to go, and so \ntheir lives become restricted to a smaller circle of contacts and interactions and they become \ndependent on others. Becoming socially isolated leads to feelings of loss, a decline in feelings of \ncompetence and self-worth, a feeling of purposeless and an erosion of identity (Alpass & Neville, \n2003; Pinquart & Sorensen, 2001):   \nIdentity is a feature of the clustering of relations around specific aspects of embodiment, \nsuch as health, gender, sport and exercise, body medication, disability or growing old. \nJust as embodiment emerges from activity and practice (what a body can do), so does a \nsense of self (Fox 2012: 80) \nTaking action, on the other hand is an opening up to becoming, and evolving, making the \ndecision to move forward wherever it might lead. It does not presuppose a particular destination \nor an end goal.   Participants\u2019 descriptions captured this idea of openness and emphasis on \ntaking action, as the following excerpt where Bryony describes what being healthy meant to her:     \n\u2026 [it\u2019s] an absence of symptoms, but it\u2019s also just a general state of mind.  So it\u2019s my \nbody being able to move freely and do all the things I need to do in a day; and it\u2019s my \nmind being happy, bright, and alert and me having energy \u2026.  So that\u2019s healthy \n(Bryony/VB)  [underlining added for emphasis]  \n177 \n \n \nNumerous studies have documented the importance to overall wellbeing of being able to \nmaintain activities which allow people to participate in society in the way they choose (Mammen \n& Faulkner, 2013; Teychenne et al., 2008; Warburton et al., 2006).  If illness and disability, or \neven fear of it, can deterritorialise a person\u2019s sense of self, then taking action in the way the \nparticipants had done was a process of reterritorialisation. This is not to suggest that \nparticipants found their health problems magically \u2018cured\u2019 \u2013 though certainly some reported \nimprovements - but rather that they gained a sense of control and coping, allowing them to face \nwhatever might lie ahead in the future.      \nMoving outwards from any blockage and \u2018reterritorialising\u2019 seemed to infuse participants with \nnew energy, determination and a sense of purpose, a feeling of being \u201ccreative rather than \nreactive to meet their real (not symbolic) needs\u201d (Fox & Ward, 2008: 1008). Their accounts \nfocused almost entirely on what they believed the supplements had allowed them to do, rather \nthan expecting to find a perfect cure from whatever physical condition they had:   \n \u2026   I\u2019ve got arthritis, mainly in my thumbs \u2026..   I\u2019ve been on these for ages \u2013 glucosamine \nwith chondroitin and it\u2019s the chondroitin that helps.  When I\u2019m only on glucosamine I \nneed more.  And that has kept it at bay.  It\u2019s amazing actually, combined with the fish \noil\u2026.   Well I\u2019m 63 and I feel young and I want to be young for my grandchildren.  I\u2019ve got \ntwo grandchildren now, so doing what I\u2019m doing, is allowing that to happen. (Sally) \nSally\u2019s comment indicates that she feels she is moving into the future with confidence that she \nwill be able to evolve with her grandchildren. Another participant, Vonnie, similarly spoke about \nthe supplement she took now and again for her low mood had \u201chelped me through some really \nrough patches\u201d.  The way she phrased it suggests a sense of movement, overcoming a barrier \nand an increase in confidence that she can move on and cope with what may come.  For both \nSally and Vonnie, their supplement use seems to have become be part of their identity, \nincorporated into how they see themselves and how they wish to be seen by others, in the same \nway that pharmaceuticals may be for those who rely on them as an enabler to participating  in \neveryday activities (Dew et al., 2015). It was clear from talking to these participants that though \nthey were optimistic, they were also realistic. Their focus was much more about keeping their \nproblem \u201cat bay\u201d, so that it did not cut them off from whatever opportunities they might come \nacross in the future.    \nDeleuze and Guatarri argued that the root of a person\u2019s identity was in the dynamic interaction \nbetween the social context and \u201c\u2026 the affirming, creative, and embodied \n178 \n \n \nexperimentation/engagement of the living body \u2026.  the sum of psychological, emotional and \nphysical connections that a body has (Fox and Ward 2008: 1008).  Many of the participants \nclearly enjoyed being creative in all sorts of ways, experimenting and improvising, not simply in \ntrying out supplements and other alternative health care options, but in other areas of their lives \nas well.  None illustrated this more vividly than Duncan\u2019s account of his diverse experiences.  He \nhad a thirst for experimentation and although he grew up in a somewhat unconventional family \nwho already used alternative health modalities, as a young adult he wanted to explore horizons \nbeyond what he already knew:  \n\u2026 out of curiosity [I] went into other things \u2026  to see what was out there and how it \nworked. I wanted to try a bunch of different healers to see which one I liked and see what \nI would potentially be interested in \u2026I got hypnotherapy \u2026 I\u2019ve done all sorts of things.   \nDuncan\u2019s adventures took him to Peru to visit a shaman and take ayahuasca, as I have already \ndescribed, but that was only one of many lines of flight through diverse modalities, therapies \nand alternative products that he experimented with.  He had briefly been involved with network \nmarketing, and had enrolled in various courses in modalities that interested him.  He had \ntouched on Chinese medicine through an acquaintance, experimented with body building \nsupplements as well as herbals, and dabbled in reiki.  Tracing Duncan\u2019s narrative,  was a verbal \nrepresentation of  a rhizomatic network in the process of becoming; a heterogeneous mix of \nconnections with many people, things, sources of information, therapies, world views on health \nand illness, various countries he had lived in or passed through and jobs he had been engaged in. \nIt traced his deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation both literally in terms of changing \nmodalities, countries and employment, and figuratively in terms of his changing views. At the \ntime I spoke to him he told me that he was tending towards a greater interest in and respect for \northodox medicine but still mixed in a range of other practices, such as using reiki to calm his \nyoung son, and was clearly still evolving his ideas and practices as he accumulated more life \nexperiences.    \nA number of other participants echoed this theme of \u201cexperimentation in the world\u201d (Holland, \n2013: 34). Far from being the earnest people portrayed in the academic literature as \u2018worried \nwell\u2019, they seemed to find it engaging and fun to explore various products and therapies that \nthey came across.  Pat, Tessa and Molly all commented directly that they enjoyed experimenting \nwith a range of alternative options, and many others recounted the different products and \ntherapies, both orthodox and alternative that they had come into contact with and tried.  Rana \n179 \n \n \nrelated her experience with a product that had not worked out for her.  It appeared to be from a \nnetwork marketer rather than bought over the counter from a pharmacy or health store:    \n\u2026there was somebody that was selling them.  I can\u2019t remember the name of the product \nbut they were selling supplements and I tried them and what happened was I ended up \ngetting more migraines.  So I stopped taking that particular brand and then I went and I \nbought some evening primrose oil.  It would have been from the health food shop. (Rana) \nShe was undeterred by the failure of the first product and pleased she had learned from the \nexperience. Similarly, Tessa also spoke about experimenting with products, in her case \nhomeopathics, some that she had bought herself and others that she had prescribed by a \nhomeopath. Although she considered them to have been harmless, she believed they had been \na waste of money in her case, and not something that she would buy again:   \u201cI don\u2019t think \nhomeopathics work very well for me in general\u2026I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s made much difference.  \nThe same with bach flower remedies.\u201d The key factor in these experiences was that the \nparticipants continued to learn what suited them and what did not.  They seemed unconcerned \nabout \u2018failures\u2019. In contrast to the ideas of health risk as something to avoid, covered in Chapter \n5, these forays into new fields were more like counter-risk discourses (Casas-Cort\u00e9s et al., 2008; \nKeshet & Popper-Giveon, 2018; Soane et al., 2010) that pushed boundaries and created new \nknowledge about products that suited them or not. They clearly viewed whatever element of \nrisk there might have been as something they could control and felt comfortable, even \nenthusiastic about (Lyng, 2008).  They spoke just as if it were a hobby or creative outlet, trying \nout new cooking styles, attempting new sports, or delving into different forms of art or music. In \neffect it was the same sort risk taking that Lupton and Tulloch (2002: 117) identify as self-\nimprovement, that gives \u201cmovement and progression \u2026 to the trajectory of one\u2019s life.\u201d Their \n\u2018failures\u2019 thus were not something that they regretted, but became a further step on the path to \ngreater knowledge and their overall identity development \nConclusion \nThe sense of self and life-satisfaction that the participants appeared to have gained from their \nexperiences with supplements is where all three aspects of this chapter come together and \naddress the research gap identified in the introduction.   At one point each of the participants \nhad made a seemingly small decision to take (or sell) a product for a health concern, a decision \nwhich had its origins in the coming together of their internalised ideas of responsibility and the \nfreedom to wield that responsibility.  They had set their own terms as to when they would use \n180 \n \n \northodox medicine and when they would use that freedom to resist its control and use \nalternative methods of health care they chose for themselves. Similarly, the same responsibility \nand freedom could be mobilised to participate in the commercial market to the extent that it \nsuited them but resist being drawn in to its power.  Because they were also well connected to \nother areas of the modern neoliberal economy they had been able to use economic and \ntechnical means to experiment with what supplements and alternative therapies they found \nuseful and so were continually developing expertise in the way they chose to care for \nthemselves.  This ongoing process was contributing to their sense of self through the bringing \ntogether of the many inter-related connections within the assemblage around the activities they \nenjoyed participating in, which were in turn enriching their feeling of meaning and purpose as \nthey moved on with their life journey.   \nThis chapter draws to a close the analysis of the data generated in the interviews with the study \nparticipants.  The chapter that follows moves on from the participants and draws from the wider \nassemblage of ideas developed from all three analysis chapters to discuss what they add to a \nnew understanding of people\u2019s engagement with practices around supplement use.  \n  \n181 \n \n \nChapter 7:  Concluding discussion \nSupplement practices: the intra-action of discourse, materiality and power  \nThis study set out to investigate how people make sense of their supplement use; to explore \nwhat they say about the products they take and to develop a greater understanding of how and \nwhy they had come to use them.  The aim was to focus on supplement use as a practice in its \nown right, rather than to view it as just another one of the broader range of complementary and \nalternative (CAM) therapies or to provide an answer to the criticisms of orthodox medicine \nabout supplements and those who use them. However, these issues have been taken into \naccount at times when the data were directly relevant to them. The methods for the study were \nprimarily humanist; that is, the data were generated in interviews with participants.  As the \nstudy progressed, however, it became clear that the material products of the supplements were \nalso important and that they needed to be recognised as having a force of their own rather than \nbeing treated as inert matter of incidental relevance only (Coole & Frost, 2010). The \nmethodology and analysis, therefore, have incorporated a broadly post-humanist approach so as \nto give due weight to the material presence of the supplements.  I have taken the view in this \nstudy that non-human \u2018things\u2019, are always culturally and socially produced (Coole & Frost, 2010; \nJackson & Mazzei, 2012) just as the knowledge and practices of their users are deeply entwined \nin materiality. Moreover, that the practices that result from this co-production of the human and \nnon-human have the power to influence not only individual lives, but also wider social, cultural, \ncommercial, and regulatory discourses, relationships, and activities.    \nAssemblage thinking using Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s metaphor of the rhizome (1987) has been \nused throughout the analysis. The concept of the rhizomatic assemblage reveals the messy \ntangle of interconnected and competing actants that are involved in supplement use and the \nway that they constantly form and reform in temporary arrangements: material things, people, \ndiscourses, relationships, social, political and economic concerns, technologies, and power.  So \nthat the reason why any individual uses supplements is likely to be interwoven with a complex \nnetwork of actants that come from their background and upbringing, their life experiences and \ncurrent world view, personal connections, social interactions and discourses, commercial \ntransactions, previous contacts with orthodox health services, and information acquired through \nthe global and local media (Gubbi et al., 2013; Zanella et al., 2014). Supplement users are not \noutside the assemblage, \u2018pulling the strings\u2019 but are themselves actants within the complex and \nconstantly evolving network.  They act but are also acted upon by the multiplicity of \n182 \n \n \ncomponents, and while their actions add to its complexity and richness, they themselves are also \nenriched and changed in an ongoing process, experimenting with what they are now and what \nthey might become (Fox 2012: 99).   \nWithin the overall concept of the evolving rhizomatic assemblage, the three analysis chapters \nfocused in turn on a particular set of actants that addressed the research gaps identified in the \nintroduction.  Each chapter drew on different theoretical concepts to examine the multiple \nconnections between them in the light of the data.  Chapter 4, focused in depth on popular \ndiscourses about supplements.  Using Derrida\u2019s ideas of deconstruction, naturalness, holistic \nhealth, and health risk were examined in turn, shown to be contested and diverse, yet rather \nthan losing their overall salience, the complex nuances of these discourses added exponentially \nto the interconnections that took place between them and from which the participants drew.   \nChapter 5 foregrounded the physical matter of the supplement products. Using Bennett\u2019s \nconcept of \u2018thing power\u2019 it demonstrated how the non-human and human interacted to create \neffects that spread out far beyond the actions of individuals.  Chapter 6 then looked at issues of \npower drawing from Foucault\u2019s notion of biopower and its manifestation in the modern \nneoliberal state.  It showed how supplement users were bringing together their views on \nresponsibility, the material products of supplements, the freedom of the market, and their \naccess to global information to develop an identity as experts in their own health.  All three \nchapters demonstrated how the ongoing interaction between the various actants in the \nassemblage gave rise to continual change and development.   \nDiscourse, materiality and power, though examined separately in the analysis chapters, come \ntogether in this final chapter.  I have found that these three aspects are deeply and inextricably \nentangled together in the way supplements and supplement practices are manifested in the \nworld.  Each of them is necessary but none is sufficient on its own to understand how people \nmake sense of their practices with supplements.  By taking all three into account together, I \nbelieve a different and potentially more comprehensive understanding of what supplements do \nfor those who use them is produced.  This is the principal result of my research and I believe it \nopens up a new way of thinking about supplements and those who use them.   I stop short of \ncalling it a definitive \u2018finding\u2019; the theoretical framework of the rhizomatic assemblage of actants \nwould appear to preclude any such absolute conclusion. Instead I describe it as revealing new \ninsights into the possibilities that supplements create for those whose lives are entangled with \nthem. Seeing supplements in this way gets beyond the previous approaches which do not \nappear to have considered these three forces in combination.   \n183 \n \n \nTo further explain how I believe these three aspects to be co-constituted in the many ways that \nsupplements are used and understood I have turned to the concept of intra-action proposed by \nKaren Barad (2007). Barad\u2019s ideas originated from her work in quantum physics, but she came to \napply them more generally to the ordinary events of daily life.  Barad\u2019s key concept is her \ninsistence that: \nMatter and meaning are not separate elements.  They are inextricably fused together, \nand no event, no matter how energetic can tear them asunder (Barad 2007: 3).  \nTherefore all phenomena, as the results of this fusion are termed, are contextual rather than \nabsolutes, brought about by what Barad terms intra-action, that is, the mutual entanglement of \nboth the \u201chuman and non-human, material and discursive, natural and cultural factors\u201d (Barad \n2007: 26) [original emphasis].  The most crucial point about intra-action is that it is more than \nsimply an inter-connection where the connecting bodies (whether human or non-human) retain \ntheir separate identities:     \n \u2026in contrast to the usual \u2018interaction\u2019, which assumes that there are separate individual \nagencies that preceded their interaction, the notion of intra-action recognizes that \ndistinct agencies do not precede but rather emerge through, their intra-action (Barad \n2007: 33). \nSo when bodies intra-act, they come together to produce something quite new and different \nthat emerges from \u201cwithin the relationship rather than outside it\u201d (Kerr et al 2014).   The \nphenomena that come into being through intra-action are temporary, existing for that moment \nonly, and each of them is just one of an endless array of possibilities that are always ongoing.  \nThey are  \u201cforever being reenfolded and reformed\u201d (Barad, 2007: 177), brought into being by  \n\u201cdifferent agential cuts that materialize different phenomena\u201d (Barad, 2007: 178).  The \u2018agency\u2019 \nhere is the action or the \u2018doing\u2019 of the process, an enactment that \u201creworks [or \u2018cuts\u2019 together]  \nwhat matters and what is excluded from mattering\u201d in that moment (Barad, 2007: 178).  The \nconcept of agential cuts is a way of conceptualising how these differences are made or unmade \ndepending on how the various components of matter and meaning, nature and culture, human \nand non-human are \u2018cut together\u2019 (or entangled) through intra-action to bring about the \ndifferent events, actions, things, and ideas that go to make up the world as we know it. \nInterestingly, Barad credits Foucault\u2019s concept of the disciplined subject as a co-production of \nbodies, knowledge and power as prefiguring her ideas of intra-action, but considers that \nsomething more than biopower is now needed to account for \u201ccontemporary technoscientific \n184 \n \n \npractices which provide for a much more intimate, pervasive and profound reconfigurings of \nbodies, power, knowledge\u201d (Barad 2007: 200).     \nI chose to use Barad at this point in addition to Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s overarching concept of \nthe rhizomatic network of actants, because I found that the concepts of intra-action and agential \ncuts enabled me to better understand the way that discourse, materiality and power come \ntogether in a such a variety of combinations to produce the multiple phenomena of supplements \nand their use.  I viewed these concepts from Barad as building further on the idea of the \nrhizomatic network (at least as I understood it), where the nodes, shoots, and lines of flight, \nthough tangled together, seemed to be inter-connected rather than engaged in creating new \nphenomena.  Fox and Alldred (2017: 26) also appear to make this distinction between Barad and \nDeleuze and Guattari, writing that the latter \u201cconsider how the physical and cultural assemble \ntogether to produce bodies, social formations and events.\u201d While something akin to intra-action \nmay be implied by Deleuze and Guattari (1987), or at least not ruled out, Barad\u2019s ideas appear to \nbe arguing for something beyond simply \u2018assembling together\u2019.  Assembling, suggests, to take an \nexample from the very practical world of food preparation, a salad of greens, tomatoes, \ncucumber and capsicum tossed together in a bowl.  While they are interconnected \u2013 or \nassembled together to make the salad - the individual pieces retain their identity and can be \npicked out again, perhaps if someone dislikes the cucumber.  A cake or custard, on the hand, is a \nresult of intra-action; an entirely new \u2018thing\u2019 which cannot be disassembled into the parts from \nwhich it has been co-constituted. \nBarad\u2019s concept was also helpful for me in bringing a more practical focus to Deleuze and \nGuattari\u2019s rather abstract philosophy (Jackson & Mazzei, 2012: 111). She has applied intra-action \nto specific contemporary issues in technology, science, education, politics, and gender and given \nuseful concrete examples: the material-discursive enactments that produce ultrasound images, \nfor instance, or the \u2018the worker\u2019 in a factory (Barad 2007: 243).  The concepts of intra-action and \nagential cuts therefore seemed to illuminate the myriad of diverse phenomena of everyday life \nwhich are mostly taken for granted, as described in the food preparation example above.  They \nseemed therefore to be directly relatable to the apparently mundane actions of buying, selling, \nand ingesting supplements.     \nTurning to Barad, however, did not mean setting aside the other theoretical concepts I had used \nbut seeing them all as complementing one another. All of them are consistent with the ideas of \nfluidity, change, the rejection of fixed divisions and categories, and the recognition that \n185 \n \n \ncompeting elements exist within all unities, even those that appear entirely coherent (see Barad, \n2010: 176).  Barad and Deleuze and Guattari all understand the world as being in a constant \nstate of continual, but non-linear evolution; Barad uses the term dynamic, whereas Deleuze and \nGuattari (1987: 27) write about \u201ca stream without beginning or end.\u201d   Both include the idea of \nrandomness in the way this evolution happens; Barad describes unexpected happenings as \ncontingent, while for Deleuze and Guattari they are the lines of flight.  Derrida does not focus \ndirectly on the non-human, but insists that there are no fixed states and bounded entities \n(1997), and Bennett writes of the dynamic agency of material things that while not intentional, is \n\u201cbound up with the idea of a trajectory, a directionality, a movement away from somewhere, \neven if the toward-which it moves is obscure or absent\u201d (Bennett 2010: 32).  Foucault\u2019s \ngenealogical approach also sees \u201chistory in terms of an ongoing chaotic struggle between \ndifferent forces and between different levels - or patterns \u2013 of time\u201d (Danaher et al., 2000: 101).  \nThese ideas underpin the discussion that follows.  In the first section, I show how different \nagential cuts materialise the multitude of different phenomena that are enacted around \nsupplements and supplement practices. I look not just at the products themselves and the \npeople who use them but also at the phenomena that constitute their manufacture, promotion \nand sale, regulation, and the counter-discourses about them.  The second section then returns \nto focus on the supplement users and the core aim of the thesis; to provide new insights into \nwhy and how supplement users make meaning from their practices.  The chapter, and the thesis, \nconcludes with final comments on the contribution of supplement practices to the ongoing life \njourney, and how they link back to ancient themes of the quest and the substances that \nstrengthen and fortify those who pursue it.   \nSupplement practices: entangled phenomena  \nDrawing from Barad\u2019s concept of intra-action, supplements and supplement practices can be \nseen as series of never ending temporary phenomena, constituted from the entanglement of \nelements of materiality, discourse and power in different agential cuts.  I start the discussion \nhere with the entangled phenomena of personal supplement purchase and ingestion, as they \nwere the original inspiration for the thesis.  These are the spontaneous or deliberate decisions \npeople make, the purchases they conclude, and the products they ingest, all of which emerge \nfrom the intra-action of the human and non-human actors.  Each individual action may seem \nunremarkable on the surface, yet every one is the end result of a chain of complexities which has \nbrought together a product (matter), the surrounding context of the individual\u2019s beliefs about \n186 \n \n \nthe product (discourse and meaning) and capabilities that allow them to control how and where \nthey obtain and use the material products (power).  Moreover each enactment is unique to that \nmoment, depending on the particularities of the individual\u2019s needs, the product they are taking \nat that point, the technologies and sources of supply through which they have learnt about and \nobtained it, their personal history, relationships, world views, and their expertise and knowledge \nof options for managing their health.  All these and more are entangled together in an agential \ncut that \u201creworks what matters and what is excluded from mattering\u201d at that particular moment \n(Barad 2007: 177).  The moment is both in and outside of linear time in a dimension Barad calls \n\u201cspacetimemattering\u201d (2014: 176).  So while it is taking place in the here and now, each agential \ncut carries within it different memories, habits and meanings of the past as well as expectations \nand hopes for the future (Neale & Flowerdew, 2003), all bound together in a \u201cthick web of \nspecificities\u201d (Barad 2014: 176) that come together in that momentary enactment.   \nA different entanglement occurs where personal supplement use merges with commerce in the \nassemblage around supplement users who also enact an identity as user-sellers. They may \nembrace this role with enthusiasm if they believe in the material products they sell and see \nthemselves as helping and guiding others or enact it somewhat reluctantly if they see it as \nperipheral to their core role, for example in a pharmacy.  Whatever their underlying attitude, \nhowever, they enter a space that brings into being the \u201cmarriage of pragmatism and idealism\u201d \n(Bardaglio, 2005: 18) that goes to make up entrepreneurship.  Even those who deal reluctantly \nwith the commercial side of selling and are motivated primarily by idealism and a desire to help \nothers, are pragmatic enough to know that meeting the customer demand for supplements is \nnecessary to maintain the viability of their business in a competitive market.  While a certain \namount of selectivity may take place among user sellers when talking about their work, with \nmost highlighting the ideological aspects and downplaying the commercial side, it is too \nsimplistic to see them as being driven solely by self-interest (see Lewis, 2019).  Rather their \nactivities are a co-production of matter and discourse \u201claced together in an entrepreneurial \nentity that maintains its overall integrity\u201d (Jones et al., 2008: 330) in the context of the \nneoliberal economy that values activities that promote innovation and growth (Herrick; \nMorrison, 2000: 68), and encourages citizens to be entrepreneurs of the self (Foucault, 1988).   \nThese personal practices, however, are not the only way that elements of discourse, materiality \nand power come together around supplements.  The production and marketing of supplements \ntoo, from large corporations to small niche companies can also be seen as a series of material \ndiscursive phenomena where the raw materials that make up the products, the technical \n187 \n \n \nprocesses, data analytics, the human shareholders and staff are all brought together.  All these \ncan be cut together with discourses of profit making and commercial power to confirm the \ncompany\u2019s viability to the share market and wider business world, or alternatively be presented \nthrough idealistic discourses of health and wellbeing to market products to the public.  While \nnot all of these phenomena will succeed in their aim of profitability and may sometimes fade \nout, the overall co-production of commerce, technology and discourse is never static but simply \nmoves on to a new iteration (perhaps leaving the retailer to unload those surplus products).  \nLoyalty cards, for instance, are a perfect example of the intra-action of matter and discourse \nwhich brings together the material products, a range of discourses about cheaper prices, good \nvalue, and rewards for repeat business for the consumers.  The same discourses and products \nare cut together in another way for the product companies and their shareholders that results in \npower to amass the personal details and buying habits of card holders to track sales and create \ndata to support future promotions and product developments.    \nThe products themselves can also be seen as phenomena emerging through intra-action of \nmeaning and matter.  A single material product like echinacea or olive leaf, for example, can \nperform as a natural-simple-safe \u2018thing\u2019, an ethically produced sustainable thing; it can enact a \nstory of historical use in traditional societies, or a story of modern technology that has found a \nnew way of extracting it in a more concentrated form or combining it with other products for a \nnovel or more powerful effect.  Other products offer the reassurance and support of a being a \n\u2018helping-hand\u2019, calming stress, or \u2018managing\u2019 blood sugar.  Equally they can be constituted to \noffer vitality and energy, or bargain prices and value for money.  Nor do these individual \nphenomena necessarily have inner coherence, but may be co-constituted from contradictory \nelements.  Take for example, the obvious discordance between the heavily promoted \u2018natural\u2019 \naspects of the products and their manufactured capsule or powdered formats and packaging.  \nWhichever way that the differences are brought together, however, they keep (be)coming, a \nconstant stream of products that combine matter and meaning in a seemingly endless variety of \ncombinations that fit with the discourses of the moment.  \nAt the same time, however, other phenomena materialise to resist the \u2018things\u2019 that are \nproduced by the commercial supplement producers, and continually push back against their \npower.  These come not only from orthodox health care and regulatory authorities (discussed \nbelow) but also from the co-production of discourses about consumer rights, the purchasing \npower of consumers, and the learned experience of operating in the modern neoliberal \neconomy, which, after all, exists on a much wider scale than the supplement market alone \n188 \n \n \n(Izberk-Bilgin, 2010; Mejri et al., 2012; Ulver-Sneistrup et al., 2011). The supplement companies, \non their part, are well aware of scepticism and resistance that exists around their products and \ntake pains to understand and develop strategies to counteract it (Amawate & Deb, 2019; Elving, \n2013; Mimouni Chaabane, 2016). In this way, the push-pull of supply and demand, cost and \nvalue are constantly moving material-discursive enactments that bring together bodies, \ndiscourses, material products and power.  None would come into being without the others; if \nthere were no discourses, the products would have no place or meaning, and without the \nproducts, there would nothing to discourse about and nothing over which to assume power.   \nThe policies and regulations around supplements, too, are worthy of attention as an area where \ndiscourse, matter and power intra-act to produce supplements as legitimate or not, and \ntherefore freely accessible or not to consumers. Supplements are valuable economically within \nan economy that promotes growth in the sale of material things even if they are incompatible \nwith the advice recommended by orthodox health experts. They therefore continue to be \nproduced as (mostly) legitimate items in the policy and regulatory world, depending on the \nparticular bodies that hold the power of decision-making about them.  Melatonin, is one \nexample of a product that may be freely sold over the counter in the United States for \npromoting sleep and reducing jet lag, but is restricted to being prescribed by a doctor or \npharmacist in New Zealand and for certain ages and conditions only (Medsafe, 2018).  The same \nkind of variable differentiation takes place within orthodox medicine itself in a number of \nsituations.  Products may be approved \u2018evidence-based\u2019 entities if prescribed by a health \nprofessional exercising the power vested in them (Bjelakovic et al., 2014) but cut apart from \nlegitimacy as \u2018alternative\u2019 and \u2018risky\u2019 if sold or used without medical direction (Geyer et al., 2008; \nSarino et al., 2007; Stickel et al., 2009; Werner, 2014). Alternatively, they may be enacted as \nlegitimate or not over time.  The status of calcium supplements, for example, which were \ncommonly prescribed as bone strengthening medicinal products for menopausal women at one \ntime, has been called into question, with the risk of engendering adverse cardiac events now \nsaid to outweigh any benefits  they might have (Li et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2015; Zittermann et \nal., 2011).   On the other hand, a form of glucosamine and some probiotic supplements now \nappear to be hovering on the cusp of being legitimised treatments rather than their previous \nstatus as non-effective supplements (AGA, 2019; Kucharz et al., 2016).  Evolution across time in \nthe way particular substances are produced as suitable or unsuitable for the public is nothing \nnew.  Throughout the history of medicine from blood-letting and leeches to cocaine, laudanum \nand tonics (Crellin, 2004) matter and discourse have been cut together in different ways to enact \n189 \n \n \nmedicinal treatments as legitimate or not.  These examples serve to demonstrate that not only \nin the world of supplements, but across the entire world of health care, there is constant fluidity \nin the way medicinal substances are enacted; nothing is fixed and permanent, but always \nevolving and changing.  And, while \u201cintra-actions always involve particular \nexclusions\u2026possibilities aren\u2019t narrowed in their realisation; new possibilities open up as others \nare excluded\u201d (Barad, 2007: 177).   \nThis fluidity also applies to the intra-action of matter, discourse, and power in the ongoing \ncritique of supplements and their users by orthodox medicine.  While the focus of the study was \nto explore supplements in depth rather than to answer the objectivist-realist arguments about \nineffectiveness and lack of evidence, it would seem incomplete not to raise these issues at all, \nparticularly as it was partly the nature of the oppositional discourses about supplements that \nsparked my original engagement with the topic. Moreover, these discourses are well rehearsed, \nfrequently appear in the popular media and were raised, unprompted, by many of the study \nparticipants themselves.  Lewis (2019) has discussed the concerted efforts of a particular group \nof actors in Australia through the use of media releases and other material-discursive \nenactments to produce all complementary and alternative practices (CAM) in Australia as \nillegitimate.  Although Lewis (2019) does not overtly take a post-humanist stance, her critique \nhighlights the way these statements about alternatives tend to be presented as a truth that is \n\u201caltogether natural, self-evident, and indispensable\u201d (Foucault, 1991: 75).  Her analysis shows, \nhowever, that the arguments have also evolved and changed over time, gradually moving away \nfrom discourses about the potential harm and ineffectiveness of supplements to focus on those \nthat see them as being driven by commercially motivated global businesses that are exploiting a \nna\u00efve public taken in by slick marketing.   \nBy \u201cforegrounding  rather than bracketing\u201d (Mauthner, 2015: 327) the concerted campaign of \nthis particular group of Australian actors to issue press releases and other statements that \nsupport their viewpoint (Lewis, 2019), the same process of material-discursive intra-action can \nbe seen to be taking place.  The material products (supplements), assertions of power through \nprofessional knowledge and control over health treatments, and discourses of commercial self-\ninterest and problematisation of lay claims to understand their own health are brought together \nin a series of agential cuts that materialise supplement use as a baffling and frustrating  \nphenomenon to health professionals (Guallar et al., 2013; Lewis, 2019; Ronda et al., 2009), or, at \ntimes, as a purposeful undermining of expertise developed through professional training and \npractice in the prescribing of  medicines (Barnes et al., 2016; Guallar et al., 2013).  For even \n190 \n \n \nthough groups of health professionals may disagree over inclusion or exclusion of a particular \ntreatment or  who should be credentialed in a particular sphere of practice, they are \nnevertheless all part of an assemblage that has a common philosophy based on the currently \naccepted form of scientific knowledge that may be mobilised for patient care (Lamont & Moln\u00e1r, \n2002). Supplement users, however, are enacting their own material-discursive practices \nresulting from different agential cuts in the assemblage of actants.  As Jackson and Mazzei \n(2012: 126) point out, multiple becomings can result from intra-action, not only between \ndifferent groups of people (for example the health professionals and supplement users \ndescribed above), but there is a multiplicity of becomings for every individual as well.  As Barad \nputs it (2010: 176) \u201ceach moment is alive with different possibilities for the world\u2019s becoming \nand different reconfigurings of what may yet be possible\u201d.   \nMany supplement users do ascribe a range of physical, mental, and spiritual effects to the \nproducts that they take and relate these to their overall health and wellbeing. While these \neffects are clearly meaningful to those who report them, others note that they continue to take \nproducts even if they have no idea if they \u2018work\u2019 or not, suggesting that the meanings that \nmatter lie elsewhere.  For supplement users, the question is not about bioavailability or any \nother physiological explanation of how the products work (Wahlberg, 2008),  but rather what \nthey do for those who use them, what that means, and why it matters. Thinking about \nsupplements in this way cuts across the rival epistemologies of realism and constructionism and \nfocuses on the \u201cdynamic, generative and rhizomatic production and actualisation of the world in \nwhich both matter and meaning play a part\u201d (Fox and Alldred, 2017: 26).   The next section, \ntherefore, examines the meanings that may be produced from intra-action in the supplement \nassemblage and how these become woven in to their users\u2019 continuing quest for a meaningful \nlife.     \nMeaning, matter, ritual and symbolism     \nWhat makes a meaningful life is one of the \u2018big questions\u2019, perhaps the big question; it has been \nendlessly explored since antiquity in philosophy, literature, the arts, and science and continues \nto be the subject of fascination in contemporary times. Tolstoy, Socrates, Camus, among many \nothers considered it to be the ultimate philosophical question (Martela & Steger, 2016: 535-\n536). If we do not believe our lives are meaningful then we may feel that everything we do is \nsimply displacement activity until we die,  or in Shakespeare\u2019s words, \u201ca tale told by an idiot, full \nof sound and fury, signifying nothing\u201d (Macbeth V:V). Discussions of what makes for a \n191 \n \n \nmeaningful life often begin by referring to Aristotle\u2019s concept of eudaimonia, a word made up \nfrom the Greek daimon being the \u2018true self\u2019 and the prefix eu meaning \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018well\u2019 \n(Waterman, 1990).  Eudaimonia has been interpreted in a variety of different ways by \nphilosophers and psychologists, but all of them convey the idea of a continual striving after what \nan individual perceives as being the most desirable and truly worthwhile kind of life (Bauer et al., \n2008; Baumeister et al., 2013; Deci & Ryan, 2008; Hardie, 1979; Martela & Steger, 2016; Nagel, \n1972; Ryan et al., 2008; Ryan & Martela, 2016; Ryff, 2012; Ryff & Singer, 2008; Waterman, 1990).  \nQualities that have been proposed as contributing to eudaimonia have included coherence, \nautonomy, self-understanding, competence, relatedness and existential mattering where \nmattering is \u201ctranscending the trivial\u201d\u2026, [and feeling] \u201cthat one\u2019s actions make a difference in \nthe world\u201d (Costin & Vignoles, 2019: 2). As this variety of explanations demonstrates, \neudaimonia eludes any precise definition. Perhaps its greatest strength is its openness to be \ninterpreted as Derrida would have it, in different ways (autrement) (1997: 77), according to the \ncomplexities of the personal, cultural, and societal contexts and relationships which differ for \nevery individual.  Nevertheless, there are two consistent ideas that can be drawn from the \nconcept of eudaimonia: firstly, that it involves living in a way that feels personally meaningful \nand true to oneself, whatever that might be, and secondly, that living meaningfully is continually \nbeing enacted, a process of becoming, not a state that can be achieved once and for all.   \nReligious belief has traditionally provided a way of making meaning from the joys and \nvicissitudes of human life and reducing uncertainty about our purpose for being in the world \n(Emmons, 2005; Hogg et al., 2010; Krause & Hayward, 2012; Park, 2005; Park et al., 2013) but \nreligious belief, at least in established religions has declined in the modern age (Gorski & \nAlt\u0131nordu, 2008; Houtman & Mascini, 2002). A large number of people in Western countries hold \nto rationalist beliefs that exclude any notion of life after death (Garc\u00eda & Blankholm, 2016; \nManning, 2016; O'Brien & Noy, 2015). New Zealand in particular is said to have an identity as a \n\u201cpre-eminently secular country\u201d (Matheson, 2006: 177). If we are no longer living on earth as \npreparation for a life in some kind of divine hereafter, we are left with the need to find some \nother way to come to terms with the existential anxiety that is generated by the awareness of \nour own mortality (Hoelterhoff, 2015; Marino & Mountain, 2015; Varki, 2009), and a longing to \nfind an explanation for \u201cour birth, our death, and the pain of the journey in between\u201d \n(McCormick, 1996: 620).  \nAlternatively, the absence of a belief in a life after death may instead inspire a determination to \nmake the most of the life we have, exploring all the opportunities that offer to make it \n192 \n \n \nmeaningful (Hoelterhof, 2015).  Physical or mental illness, however, can creep up slowly or arrive \ndramatically and reduce or close off possibilities and hopes for the future (Bury, 1982; Locock et \nal., 2009; Sanders et al., 2002; Sinding & Wiernikowski, 2008).  This dilemma of theoretical \nfreedom to live fulfilling lives but only if we can ward off the bodily constraints of illness or \ndisability, has become more pressing with the extension of longevity since the mid-20th century \n(Carey & Judge, 2001; Kinsella, 2005; Kraai et al., 2013).  Advances in medical care over the past \nhalf century have made it possible for people who would otherwise have died in previous eras to \nlive longer and better than at any time in history (Gawande, 2014). Modern medicine has tended \nto promote the idea that everything can be \u2018fixed\u2019 by following guidelines for a healthy life, and \nsubmitting oneself to the care and guidance of health professionals who will ensure that health \nproblems are identified, treated and \u2018managed\u2019 (Fishman et al., 2008; Lamb, 2014; Mykytyn, \n2006). Research studies lend their weight to the same assemblage of optimistic discourses of \n\u2018longevism\u2019 (Dumas & Turner, 2015) by demonstrating incremental gains in survival for particular \ndrugs or interventions (Berger et al., 2011; Prinz & Endres, 2011; Wald & Wald, 2012). There \nhave even been suggestions that the normal life span can be almost indefinitely extended with \nthe assistance of \u2018regeneration medicine\u2019 (Lafontaine, 2009, 2015), including strategies such as \ngenetic manipulation and the availability of computer printed organs and other body parts \n(Dumas & Turner, 2015; Katz & Gish, 2015).   As Crawford (2004:505) argues, death itself has \nbeen deconstructed into innumerable specific causes against which \u201ca technical war \u2013 a spiritual \nwar in fact \u2013 must be waged.\u201d   \nIn contrast with these discourses that appear to promote an endlessly positive future, the same \nmedical advances have also created a continually growing number of people who may be alive, \nbut are also chronically ill, unable to carry out daily activities as they would wish, and sometimes \nalso cognitively impaired (B\u00e4hler et al., 2015; Lafontaine, 2015; Lehnert et al., 2011).   Moreover, \nthose who have lost independence and agency, may become stigmatised as contributors to the  \n\u2018silver tsunami\u2019 that is depriving current and future generations of their access to health and \nsocial services (Bartels & Naslund, 2013; Bluethmann et al., 2016; Bodker et al., 2019; Dumas & \nTurner, 2015; Hartt & Biglieri, 2018).  It has become clear that simply extending the number of \nyears of life may not be desirable if the quality of that life is more and more limited in scope, \nleading to social isolation and depression (Blakemore et al., 2014; DeJean et al., 2013; Duggleby \net al., 2012; Earnshaw & Quinn, 2012; Liddy et al., 2014).  It is this fear, the horror of ending up \nin a life without the agency to create ongoing meaning that would seem to underlie many of the \nfundamental urges that give rise to supplement practices.    \n193 \n \n \nSupplement users of all ages appear to have a keen feeling of uncertainty about their imagined \nfuture. While they do not seem to be fearful of death itself, many have already encountered the \nshadow of disability and appear to share a horror of being humiliated (Waskul & van der Riet, \n2002) by the \u201cprecarious dependencies\u201d (Bodker et al., 2019: 1358) that accompany the loss of \nphysical and cognitive function leading to terminal decline and the final end-of-life cascade \n(Gerstorf et al., 2013; Rajan et al., 2012). They may have the beginnings of a chronic disease and \nare fearful of it worsening; they may have experienced long-lasting sports injuries, depression, or \nwitnessed someone they love dwindle and deteriorate slowly and have resolved to avoid the \nsame fate.  Even if they are in the best of health now, and are proactive about maintaining their \nhealthy status, somewhere in the past, they have become aware that at any time their body has \nthe potential to turn on them and betray them.  Minor and \u201cmundane exposures\u201d (Hoelterhof, \n2015: 1) can trigger anxiety that the body which they had commanded at will, might turn on \nthem and let them down, or as Kristeva (1982: 4) has so pertinently put it, become \u201cthe friend \nwho stabs you.\u201d Kristeva\u2019s concept of the abject (1982) is a useful way of conceptualizing the \nhorror that supplement users seem to sense of ceasing to become, being \u201cexcluded from the \nrhythms of daily life, [experiencing] a pitiable loss of personal control and social agency\u201d \n(Gilleard & Higgs, 2011: 139).   For what use is a longer life if it is merely an existence without the \npossibility of meaning, purpose and enjoyment?  Being abject in this way is repugnant, \nloathsome, defiling; it is something that needs to be \u201cthrust aside in order to live\u201d (Kristeva, \n1982: 3).  But once the thought is recognised, it seems that it can never quite be banished:  \n In the heartlands of non-disability the abject is a cause for concern because it is too \nclose for comfort\u2026Repressed, denied but lurking, hovering, whispering barely audibly \nfrom some liminal place in the recesses of the imaginary\u2026 it is the stranger that we \ndespise but fear we might become (Hughes, 2009: 405,406).  \nMoreover, because health and morality are so intertwined (Brandt & Rozin, 1997; Conrad, 1994; \nCrossley, 2003; Metzl & Kirkland, 2010), there is an implication that \u2018virtuous\u2019 people will \nmanage to fight off disease, overcome disability and achieve \u2018successful\u2019 ageing (Cosco et al., \n2014; Geard et al., 2018; Lamb, 2014), while those who do not manage to do so have failed to \ntake responsibility for themselves and are now paying the price (Agborsangaya et al., 2013; \nLakerveld et al., 2013). Nevertheless, just as everyone must face death eventually, no matter \nhow virtuous or responsible they have been about their health, so ultimately, everyone must, \nsooner or later, fail at the moral task of being healthy, for \u201cthere is no escaping the tragedy of \nlife; that we are all aging from the day we are born\u201d (Gawande, 2014: 8). \n194 \n \n \nRather than doing nothing and simply hoping that this will not happen, supplement practices are \nan outward and visible enactment each day that confirms for the users their responsibility and \nvigilance and symbolises their determination to defer disability and the stigma of moral failure. \nTheir practices are a personally constructed and controlled form of \u2018conduct of conduct\u2019 through \nwhich they resist being drawn into the cul-de-sac of \u201cpatienthood\u201d (O'Mahony, 2019: 1799) \nwhere they have no agency and decisions about them will be guided by \u2018experts\u2019 who will decide \nwhat is best. The daily ritual of taking the material products down from the shelf and swallowing \nthem allows their users to continue their narrative in \u201cthe voice of the healthy\u201d (Hyd\u00e9n, 1997: \n62) who are able to look forward confidently to having power and control over their future.  \nWhile these rituals may \u201cbypass the frameworks of rationalism and functionalism\u201d (Bell, 1990: \n300), they nevertheless create effects. They provide certainty, meaning, and continuity to \npeople\u2019s lives (Horner, 2000; Markson & Fiese, 2000) and cannot be dismissed as irrational or \nmerely placebos (Gale, 2014).  \nRituals tend to be associated with religious practices and superstition, and therefore may be \nconsidered to have no place in the modern, scientifically-enlightened world (Quack and Sax \n2010).  Nevertheless, contemporary life is still punctuated with many kinds of normalised rituals, \neven if they are not recognised or described as such (Islam & Zyphur, 2009). The public rituals of \nstate memorials and the quasi-religious rituals of competitive sport (Brevers et al., 2011; \nHutchinson, 2009; Jackson & Baker, 2001; King, 2010; Schippers & Van Lange, 2006),  the \nstructured rituals of professional practice, for example, in law and medicine (Arluke, 2018; \nParissopoulos et al., 2013; Robinson, 2001; Robinson, 2006) and the many personal and family \nrituals in the small activities of everyday life (Hammerschlag, 1997; Hannam, 1997; Morris, 2017; \nThomson & Hassenkamp, 2008; Verma, 2013).    In short, rituals bring structure, continuity and \norder into people\u2019s lives on both a large and small scale:    \n Rituals are conscious, intentional and often repetititive bodily actions that attempt to \nimpose meaning on one or other aspect of the world \u2026.a body acting out of what sort of \nsituation one is in and what ought to be done about it. (Brody, 2010: 153)  \nRituals across the many different areas of human experience can be seen as enactments, in \nwhich material things, discourses, and the power of meaning are brought together for those that \nenact them and those for whose benefit they are enacted.  Not only do they involve material \nthings \u2013 for example the wreaths of poppies at war memorials or the birthday cake at family \ncelebrations - but they also draw on intuitive connections to modes of thought that are beyond \nscientific rationality.  They have performative, aesthetic, and cultural components that go \n195 \n \n \nbeyond their cognitive elements, linking to the imagination, the unique meanings they carry for \neach individual and their placement both within and outside linear time (Wulf et al., 2010). \nRituals connect to another dimension alongside the world of \u2018reality\u2019, where \u201crites and myths \nhelp people face the unspeakable \u2026 to cope with the problematic human predicament\u201d \n(Armstrong, 2005: 6), that is, the inevitable prospect that life ends in extinction and nothingness.    \nSupplement rituals can be seen in the same way, as a bringing together of discourse, materiality \nand power in rituals that enact personal, cultural and symbolic meanings which far exceed their \nmundane appearance and the simple act of swallowing them each day. The products themselves \ncompel attention as projecting a certain type of power in which \u201csymbolic images and gestures \nexercise a particularly persuasive effect on the participants\u2019 sense of identity and social reality\u201d \n(Bell, 1990:299).  The specially assigned spaces that containers of supplements occupy in \npeople\u2019s homes also serve to point up their ritual agency.  Almost always stored in the more \nprivate areas of the kitchen or bedroom rather than the rooms where guests are admitted and \nentertained, the supplement space is thus the site of a private daily \u2018devotion\u2019, but rather than \nthe flowers, incense and prayers offered on other altars, the supplement ritual is an offering on \nthe altar of personal responsibility that holds the hope of preserving the future from decline and \ndecay.  The ritual act of swallowing them may take place at a moment of linear time but also \nwithin the dimension of \u201cspacetimemattering\u201d described by Barad (2014:176). Bound up in the \npresent action are the past events that have been continually evolving towards that point and \nthe hopes and desires for the continuation of possibilities into an expanding future (Neale & \nFlowerdew, 2003: 193).  Maintaining the ritual is a sign of a belief that by continuing to observe \nit, they will be able to \u201ckeep on keeping on\u201d (Lundberg, 2019: unpaged) doing what they want to \ndo and warding off disability and decay for at least another day.  \nSupplement practices can thus be seen as ongoing ritual enactments that help provide a sense of \npredictability and independent agency in users\u2019 lives as they seek to keep control over their \nhealth and avoid disruptions to the future they plan for themselves (Morden et al., 2017: 369).  \nThe difference between supplement users and others is that they have chosen supplements as \ntheir preferred method of assuming control over the risks they perceive as being the most \nrelevant to their own context. Others may choose a different ritual, for example, the socio-\nmaterial practice of surgical mask wearing in Japan as a \u201crisk ritual\u201d that acts as a \u201csafety \nblanket\u201d against the threat of illness and disease for the wearer (Burgess & Horii, 2012: 1193). \nHealth rituals such as these have been interpreted as a symbolic way of ordering and gaining \npower over the \u201cinherently untidy experience\u201d of illness and disease (Williams, 1998: 449) and \n196 \n \n \ncalming \u201cthe escalating spiral of control and anxiety\u201d Crawford, 2004: 506) that is generated by a \ncontemporary culture that identifies more and more risks to health. \nThis is not to suggest that the supplement ritual is the central activity around which those who \nuse them live their lives.  It is rather a means to an end, something that allows them to defuse \ntheir anxiety about risks with confidence about the future and control anxiety over its \nuncertainty and to focus on other, more enjoyable and meaningful aspects of their life instead.  \nBy undertaking the supplement ritual each day, they can then feel they have \u2018done something\u2019 \nto deal with their concerns and can set them aside so they can get on with the activities and \nrelationships which are meaningful to them as their life journey evolves in its continual \n\u2018becoming\u2019.  The supplement enactments become an additional thread that is woven into and \nenriches their personal narrative as it evolves over time (Jones et al., 2008; Lindgren & W\u00e5hlin, \n2001; Morrison, 2000).  They come to see themselves as being \u2018someone who knows\u2019 about \nthese things (supplements and their effects), and can pass on what they know to others, hence \nthe trajectory for some supplement users into roles where they advise others.  McAdams and \nMcLean (2013: 234) give seven examples of \u201clife story constructs\u201d that people use in identity \nstories.  Of these, supplements users\u2019 accounts of their experiences are strongly connected to \nconstructs of agency (control over circumstances) and meaning making (learning something and \ngaining insight about their life).  While the coherent accounts supplement users present may \nhave been honed and smoothed through reflection and reconstruction over months or years by \nthe time they are related to a researcher (McLean, 2008), they nevertheless identify events and \nexperiences which the people telling their story have selected as being important and \nmeaningful to them.   Each of these stories, unique narratives by \u201cself-conscious language \nwielding humans\u201d (Bennett 2010: 120) provides insight into the way supplement users convey \n\u201c\u2026to the self and others, who they are now, how they came to be there and where they think \ntheir lives may be going in the future\u201d (McAdams & McLean, 2013: 233). Supplements primarily \nappear in these accounts, as the \u2018vital matter\u2019 that has given them the power to overcame a \nhurdle, and thereby set off a chain of events, creating an intra-action between the non-human \nproducts, the many other actants in the assemblage and the world views of the individuals \nthemselves.  Moreover, the strength of the personal narrative is that it does not have a \nparticular destination or foreseeable end but is always in process, open to the pursuit of many \npossible future meanings that might be made in the life yet to come.   \n Even at the most pragmatic and widely understood level of protecting and maintaining health, \nsupplements are infused with meanings that link to ideas about the potential that the future \n197 \n \n \nholds to engage in activities and experiences that an individual desires to pursue.  Their \nsupplements are enablers on the life quest, the journey in which individuals are their own \u2018hero\u2019 \nand through which they find meaning and purpose in their lives and build their identity \nnarrative.  For the life quest, whether in Greek mythology or in the 21st century, is a universal \nstory whereby the protagonist gradually moves through life in a process of evolving and \nchanging as they go, \u201cbecoming\u201d in the Deleuzian sense.  The transformational narratives that \ncame from the discussions, echoed one of the universal themes from the hero\u2019s journey; the \nhelping substance which gives the protagonist the power to resist and overcome difficulties, to \nbe or do more than they could unaided  (Applegate & Grivetti, 1997: 869S).  Supplement users \nappear to have this sense of quest in their lives, not to reach the \u2018golden fleece\u2019 of Jason and the \nArgonauts, or the \u2018water of life\u2019 of Polynesian legend by doing extraordinary deeds.  It is rather \nthat their daily practices with supplements symbolise their continuing involvement \u201cin the divine \ngame\u201d of existence\u201d (Bearn, 2013:54) without coming up against the barriers of illness and \ndisability that will stop them participating.  Whether Odysseus in the ancient world, Alice and \nher adventures in Wonderland, or the modern day-to-day adventures of the 21st century citizen, \nthe point is not necessarily the destination, but for the journey itself to be meaningful along the \nway.  Supplements, like the magic potions or reviving waters of myth and legend are enablers to \nthis end - the desire to pursue enjoyment, meaning and purpose in life, rather than to merely \nstay alive.  \n  \n198 \n \n \nReferences \nAcker, C.

Please read this information sheet carefully \nbefore deciding whether or not to participate.  If you decide to participate we thank you.  If you \ndecide not to take part there will be no disadvantage to you and we thank you for considering \nour request.   \n \nWhat is the Aim of the Project? \n \nVitamins, minerals, herbal medicines, and other dietary supplements are popular products for \nsale in every pharmacy, health food shop and supermarket.  Some information about how much \nis sold is available, but we know very little about why they are so popular.   This study aims to \nexplore in-depth how and why people use these products.  It is hoped to develop an \nunderstanding of how people decide what to take, their perceptions about the effect on their \nhealth and wellbeing, and how their self-care fits with care from health professionals.  The study \nis being undertaken as part of the requirements for Susan Bidwell\u2019s Doctor of Philosophy degree \nin Public Health.  \n \n.   \nWhat Types of Participants are being sought? \n \nTo take part, you need to be a regular user (at least three times a week or more) of one or more \ncommercially sold dietary supplements or herbal medicines.  The supplements or herbal \nmedicines may be tablets, capsules, liquids or powders.    \n \nAnother section of the research will interview up to 12 staff who work in pharmacies or health \nfood shops about the kind of questions they get asked and what kind of advice they provide.   \n  \n266 \n \n \n \nWhat will Participants be asked to do? \n \n\u2022 Should you agree to take part in this project, you will be asked to have an interview of \napproximately one hour at a time and place that suits you.  This can be at a place you \nchoose or, if you prefer, in a private room at the Department of Population Health, 34 \nGloucester Street, Christchurch. You may have another person with you if you wish.   \n \n\u2022 This research involves an open-questioning technique. The general line of questioning will \nbe about your experiences using dietary supplements and herbal medicines, for example, \nwhy you first decided to take them, where you got the information or advice from, and \nhow you think they may have helped you or not. The precise nature of the questions which \nwill be asked has not been determined in advance, but will depend on the way in which \nthe interview develops.  Consequently, although the Department of Population Health is \naware of the general areas to be explored in the interview, the Committee has not been \nable to review the precise questions to be used.  In the event that the line of questioning \ndoes develop in such a way that you feel hesitant or uncomfortable you are reminded of \nyour right to decline to answer any particular question.  \n \n\u2022 Everyone who participates in this study will  be offered a $30 petrol voucher in recognition \nof their contribution to the  research.  \n \nWhat Data or Information will be collected and what use will be made of it? \n\u2022 You will be asked to provide contact details, your age range, and ethnicity and general \nincome bracket.  Names and contact details are solely for the purposes of arranging the \ninterviews and returning transcripts and will not be used in any publications from the \nstudy including the final thesis.  \n\u2022 The interviews will be recorded on a digital recorder with your permission, downloaded \nto a computer programme and fully transcribed by the researcher.  \n\u2022 The data recorded in the interviews will be seen only by the researcher and the two \nsupervisors for this project.   \n\u2022 The transcript of your interview will be returned to you for checking and one month \nallowed for forwarding any corrections or sections that you wish to withdraw.  \n\u2022 As the final thesis is not likely to be available for several years, you will have the option \nof receiving a short, interim summary of the main points identified from the interviews.    \n\u2022 The information collected will be stored securely in such a way that only the researcher \nand supervisors will be able to gain access to it.  Any personal information about you (for \nexample, the audio recording of your interview) will be destroyed at the completion of \nthe research.  The rest of the information collected in the research will be retained for at \nleast ten years in secure storage. \n\u2022 Every attempt will be made to preserve your anonymity. You will not be identified by \nname or personal initials in any results from this study.   \n\u2022 At the completion of the project you will be informed when the full thesis is available \nonline.  \n\u2022 The results of the project may be published and will be available in the University of Otago \nLibrary (Dunedin, New Zealand) but every attempt will be made to preserve your \nanonymity. \n\u2022 This project has received no funding from sources outside the University of Otago and has \nno commercial interest.   \n267 \n \n \n \nCan Participants change their mind and withdraw from the project? \n \nYou may withdraw from participation in the project at any time without any disadvantage to \nyourself, up to the submission of the thesis. \n \nWhat if Participants have any Questions? \nIf you have any questions about our project, either now or in the future, please feel free to \ncontact either:- \nSusan Bidwell or  Dr Lee Thompson \nDepartment of Population Health   Department of Population Health  \nPhone: 03 3643618.

Some information about the quantity of \nproducts sold is available, but we know very little about why they have become so popular.  This \nstudy aims to explore how people make sense of their use of these products and also to develop \nan understanding of the experiences of staff of pharmacies and health shops who provide advice \nto them.

Gathering wild herbs has, however, been replaced today by the many products on the shelves of health stores and pharmacies in developed countries with health systems similar to New Zealand.  Previous studies of supplements and their use have largely focused on how many people use them, or subsumed supplement use within wider studies of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).  Supplement use, however, has characteristics that make it different from CAM therapies more broadly.  Yet there have been only a few investigations where supplement users have been asked directly about their practices, and those that have been done have tended to be under-theorised and so lack depth. \r\nThis study used a constructionist approach, within which supplements and their users were examined from both humanist and post-humanist perspectives. I used semi-structured interviews to generate data with 36 participants who were regular users of supplements. The interviews were supplemented by observations of the displays of products that participants brought to my attention in the home and retail settings where the interviews took place.  A critical theoretical analysis was undertaken, framed by Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s concept of the rhizomatic assemblage of multiple, interconnected actants which are always in a process of change. Within this wider framework, aspects of the data were examined using other theoretical concepts including deconstruction, the agency of matter, and Foucault\u2019s ideas of power and caring for the self. \r\nThe study revealed that popular assumptions about supplements as being natural, holistic and risk free can be deconstructed to show a wide variety of nuances and competing interpretations. Material things are significant in supplement use; not only the products themselves but the non-human communication technologies that allow individuals and companies the means to research, promote, sell or buy supplements when and where they choose across the globe. Using the experience and new knowledge acquired through these non-human things, supplement users become confident in their ability to resist over-scrutiny of their practices by the orthodox health system and this confidence becomes woven in to how they present themselves and their life story", "tags": ["Thesis or Dissertation", "Dietary", "supplements", "materiality", "discourses", "responsibility", "expertise", "identity", "health", "risk", "naturalness"], "fulltextStatus": "enabled", "subjects": ["Thesis or Dissertation"], "oai": "oai:ourarchive.otago.ac.nz:10523/10207", "deleted": "ALLOWED", "disabled": false, "journals": null, "repositories": {"id": "1033", "openDoarId": 0, "name": "Te Tumu Eprints Repository", "urlHomepage": null, "uriJournals": null, "physicalName": "noname", "roarId": 0, "baseId": 0, "pdfStatus": null, "nrUpdates": 0, "lastUpdateTime": null}, "repositoryDocument": {"id": 360558516, "depositedDate": null, "publishedDate": "2020-07-24T00:35:20+01:00", "updatedDate": "2022-02-25T20:11:09+00:00", "acceptedDate": null, "createdDate": "2020-12-11T12:40:15+00:00"}, "urls": ["http://hdl.handle.net/10523/10207"], "lastUpdate": "2022-02-25T20:11:09+00:00", "setSpecs": []}
