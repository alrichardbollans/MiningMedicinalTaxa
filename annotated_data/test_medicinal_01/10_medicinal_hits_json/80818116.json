Opening lecture6thCongress of Pharmacy in Macedonia with international participationMacedonian pharmaceutical bulletin, 62 (suppl) 7 - 8 (2016)ISSN 1409 - 8695UDC: 615.15Short communicationThe modern pharmacist: Is the future in the past?Roberto FrontiniCentre for Patient Safety, University Hospital of Leipzig, Liebigstra\u00dfe20, 04103 Leipzig, GermanyBackgroundThe role of the pharmacist changed during the centu-ries. In the 20th century most of the pharmacists accepted a role as provider of medicines and the education was miss-ing any clinical aspect. But looking back to the 18th century in Italy we discover that the role of the pharmacist was dif-ferent and similar to what should be the modern profession. In the statute of the Ospedale Maggiore della SS Annunzia-ta di Savigliano (1762) was indeed stated: \u201cThe pharmacist must accompany the physician in all rounds...and more he will make daily additional rounds to judge the pain of the most worsening patients and their immediate needs..\u201c.The pharmacist had an important clinical role and was a partner of the physician. Even more is part of the agreement be-tween the Ospedale Maggiore della SS Trinit\u00e0 di Fossano and Gino Stefano Bertolo, speziale (pharmacist) (1741): \u201c\u2026 he has to prepare the prescribed medicines... and bring them personally to the patients labelling every cup or de-canter with the number of his or her bed and compassion-ately and gently inviting to take them either immediately or at least at time of the mass in the cathedral...\u201d. The con-tract describes in fact the competencies of a modern phar-macist. He or she is the expert in preparing medicines and understands the formulation as an important issue. But his or her commitment does not end in the preparation. He or she has to go to the patient and promote adherence and best use of the medicine while using strategies for the reduction of medication errors.The challenge to speak about the fu-ture is not to re-invent the past.The environment of the 18th century was indeed dif-ferent to what we have nowadays and in this short article I would like to underline some of the challenges of a mod-ern pharmacist both in the hospital as well as in the com-munity setting. I think thatin the whole system the phar-macist should be the healthcare professional in the care team who seeks to ensure that pharmacologically active in-gredients\u00a0achieve\u00a0the\u00a0best\u00a0possible\u00a0benefit\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0individ-ual patient. The competencies of a modern PharmacistThe\u00a0 pharmacist\u00a0 needs\u00a0 first\u00a0 skills\u00a0 and\u00a0 competence\u00a0 in\u00a0the formulation of a medicine. This does not necessarily mean in the era of industrial production that the medicine is compounded in the pharmacy, but the properties of the formulation\u00a0may\u00a0influence\u00a0the\u00a0correct\u00a0use\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0adher-ence as well. Only the pharmacist can understand this in deep. Sometime is also necessary to adapt medicine to the individual, especially in paediatric patients. Skills in com-pounding are therefore of primary importance and also the modern pharmacist should not forget the roots of our pro-fession as the only manufacturer of medicines.A further taskfor a pharmacist is to seek the balance between expected effects and drug related problems. It is essential to underline that the best outcome for patients is only achievable in a multidisciplinary care team (Zuling et al., 2013) and the pharmacist as part of this team should be alert when advising patients. He or she needs social com-petence in communication with the aim to understand any problem related to the medication and explain the appro-priate use of drugs to the patient \u201c..in terms he can under-stand\u201d (EAHP, 2014). This social competence is also nec-essary in the team work. Physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals have to abandon a hier-archy driven relationship and accept each other as a partner in achieving the best for the patient. As well the patient has to be part of any decision and has to articulate the desired outcome. Especially in oncology those expectations should be respected and the goal for the care team is not necessar-ily to prolonger life but to create quality of life. OL 18Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 7 - 8 (2016)Dr. Roberto FrontiniThe challenges of a modern PharmacistIn the daily work the modern way of life and technol-ogy challenge the modern pharmacist. The daily increas-ing knowledge about drugs and their effect, complex med-ications, personalised medicines,IT technology, the over-whelming information through social media, the explosion of costs hampering healthcare systems, the globalisation of the supply chainare some examples. One example of personalised medicine may underline those challenges: Enthusiastic researchers believed that we are \u201con the leading edge of a true revolution in medicine\u201d (Collins, 2010) but critical authors say that \u201cthey can also obscure more effective approaches to common complex disorders\u201d (Juengst et al., 2012). What is true? We do not know yet as data are contradictory. But an interesting pa-per on the adherence to the targeting INR in Warfarin med-ication may show the dilemma (Kimmel et al., 2013). Kim-mel et al. (2013) explored two different approaches to con-trol\u00a0Warfarin\u00a0medication:\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0genomic\u00a0of\u00a0the patients, the second based on clinical interventions. In average no difference was found between the two groups bringing to the conclusion that \u201cgenotype-guided dosing of warfarin did not improve anticoagulation control\u201d. Inter-estingly in the subgroup of black patients the mean percent-age of time in the therapeutic range was less in the geno-type-guided group than in the clinically guided group. This example may underline that clinical interventions are still important even if our knowledge of genomics helps us to make better decisions. The modern pharmacist has to con-sider this while advising patients. In another paper (Wright et al., 2013) Wright concluded that \u201cOur ability to generate data now far outstrips our ability to interpret it\u201d.A second example of challenge for the modern phar-macist is the information technology of today. No doubt that internet and social media have completely changed our sources of information. The modern patient is informed and internet\u00a0 is\u00a0after\u00a0 the\u00a0physician\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0source\u00a0of\u00a0 informa-tion according to a study by Marrie (2013). There is some differences between young and old people (Couper et al., 2010) and persons with mental disease (e.g. depression) (Pohjanoksa-M\u00e4ntyl\u00e4 et al., 2011), the last using more and more the internet as an information source. But the qual-ity of the internet information is not necessarily the best. Celebrities\u00a0e.g.\u00a0misuse\u00a0their\u00a0influence\u00a0promoting\u00a0products\u00a0without\u00a0scientific\u00a0evidence\u00a0(Hoffman\u00a0and\u00a0Tan,\u00a02013)\u00a0and\u00a0for non-healthcare professionals is not easy to distinguish between\u00a0spam\u00a0and\u00a0real\u00a0scientific\u00a0message.\u00a0The\u00a0challenge\u00a0is for the modern pharmacist that patient sometime know more than the healthcare professional but they do not un-derstand the background. The pharmacists as well as the physician must learn comprehensive, clear and for the pa-tient understandable communication and educate him or her in the proper use of internet-information. This is no easy task as demonstrated by Watermeyerand Penn (2009). Healthcare professional\u2019s education should therefore in-clude communication training as an essential part for the transfer\u00a0of\u00a0scientific\u00a0data\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0patient.ConclusionIn conclusion between a medicine with its active in-gredient and the outcome of the patient there are a lot of barriers like e.g. drug formulation, patient attitude, social context, medication errors, patient\u2019s genomic, biased infor-mation. The pharmacist has to help patients in overcoming such barriers but this is only possible if he or she is part of a cure team working in collaborative way without hierar-chy barriers.ReferencesCollins, F.S., 2010.

RouseAccreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, 135 South LaSalle Street, Suite 4100, Chicago, Illinois, 60603-4810, United States of America* mrouse@acpe-accredit.orgPharmacy practice and the education and training re-quired to prepare pharmacists for practice have undergone dramatic change in the past several decades, and more change will come. Beyond ensuring that the right medi-cine is delivered to the right patient in the right dose, there is now a greater focus on pharmacist-delivered patient-centered care. The aims of such care are to ensure opti-mal therapeutic outcomes and improved quality of life, re-duce adverse reactions to medication and the risk of patient harm, improve access, and reduce the overall cost of health care delivery. For pharmacists, the focus has shifted from the medication itself to the correct and optimal use of the medication by the patient.With advances in technology, medical and pharmaceu-tical knowledge, medication use has a greater potential for good, but therapy is often more complex, and the risk of suboptimal outcomes or even patient harm through inap-propriate selection and/or use of medication can be high. The need for a competent healthcare professional to advise on selection and manage the medication therapy is becom-ing increasingly clear, both at the individual patient level as well as at a societal level.The foundational knowledge needed by pharmacists in the biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences has not di-minished but additional knowledge is now needed in so-cial, behavioral, administrative, and clinical sciences. But it does not stop there; in order to effectively manage the medication use process of patients and populations, phar-macists need to acquire new skills and develop the appro-priate\u00a0attitudes\u00a0and\u00a0values.\u00a0Together,\u00a0these\u00a0reflect\u00a0the\u00a0com-petency\u00a0profile\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0contemporary\u00a0pharmacist,\u00a0which\u00a0has\u00a0been described by the International Pharmaceutical Fed-eration across four domains: pharmaceutical public health, pharmaceutical care, organization and management, and professional/personal (FIP, 2012). Schools of pharmacy have to undertake a major reform of their curriculum - both in terms of content and delivery \u2013 in order to prepare graduates with the needed competen-cies,\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0\u201cfit\u00a0for\u00a0purpose\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0able\u00a0to\u00a0deliver\u00a0the\u00a0servic-es required to meet societal needs. In addition, models for continuing education and continuing professional develop-ment have to change, because it is likely that the majority of pharmacists in practice today do not have all the compe-tencies to deliver this model of care.In addition to practice and education, a third sector plays a vital role when it comes to advancing the profes-sion of pharmacy. This is the regulatory sector, which is by nature, however, more conservative due to its primary role to protect the public. For obvious reasons, profession-al regulations cannot be changing constantly, but change is certainly needed in this sector. With the roles of pharma-cists evolving and expanding, regulation of the profession has also had to change. In addition, regulation has had to change\u00a0\u2013\u00a0or\u00a0in\u00a0some\u00a0cases\u00a0be\u00a0introduced\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0time\u00a0\u2013 for the pharmacy support workforce, members of which play a vital role in supporting pharmacists to free them up to deliver pharmaceutical care, or \u201cmedication thera-py management\u201d services as now referred to in some coun-tries.It is evident that for improvements and advancement to come in the profession of pharmacy, change is required, but change will not come without commitment \u2013 commit-ment from practitioners, educators, regulators and all other key stakeholders who have a role to play. People can often recognize the change that they want to happen in their en-vironment to improve their situation. It is, however, not al-ways as easy for individuals to recognize and be commit-ted to the change that must occur within themselves. We assume that all pharmacists want to succeed in their pro-fessional careers. At the end of their career when they look CL 212Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 11 - 12 (2016)Closing lectureback, they want to believe that they have made a difference \u2026. left some \u201cfootprints.\u201d What are some of the factors that will determine whether or not pharmacists will, in fact, make a difference in the lives of patients, their professional colleagues, and others they meet and work with?

How does the profession ensure that pharmacists also develop the right attitudes and values to be ethical, professional and car-ing pharmacists, and members of inter-professional teams, working together to achieve optimal medication therapy outcomes for patients? Can these attitudes and values be \u201ctaught\u201d in a classroom? How else can they be cultivated?Beyond having the right knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values, what else determines whether or not pharma-cists will bring about the changes that are needed and have the desired impact; whether or not pharmacists make the difference in life that they aspire to make? That takes com-mitment, and \u201cCommitment to Change\u201d is the bridge that spans the \u201cchasm\u201d between learning and behavior change, between\u00a0good\u00a0intentions\u00a0and\u00a0real\u00a0impact\u00a0(Wakefield\u00a0et\u00a0al.,\u00a02003;\u00a0Wakefield,\u00a02004).While some things must change in order to achieve im-provement, certain values and attitudes must be preserved throughout the career of a pharmacist for him/her to be a successful professional, delivering quality care and oth-er services. Important lessons learned and attitudes, val-ues and habits that the author has found to be important in his pharmacy career include: have a desire to innovate; build the best team; learn to work with others who are not like you, take pride in what you do; keep searching for the things\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0hard\u00a0to\u00a0find;\u00a0keep\u00a0climbing;\u00a0draw\u00a0on\u00a0others\u2019\u00a0experience;\u00a0find\u00a0a\u00a0mentor;\u00a0be\u00a0a\u00a0mentor;\u00a0take\u00a0some\u00a0chanc-es; build strong networks; know your strengths and don\u2019t underestimate\u00a0your\u00a0contribution;\u00a0find\u00a0things\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0passion-ate about; don\u2019t suffer from \u201cparalysis by analysis\u201d or al-ways insist on perfection; there are no shortcuts to any place worth going; partner with people who share your vi-sion; not all change leads to improvement\u2026 but all im-provement requires change; and perhaps most importantly, sometimes \u201cavailability\u201d is more important than \u201cability.\u201dReferencesFIP (International Pharmaceutical Federation), 2012.

These drugs can be collectively called New Psychoactive Substances (NPS). The key features are that NPS are psychoactive i.e. ones that stimulate, or de-press the central nervous system, or cause a state of depen-dence; have a comparable level of potential harm to inter-nationally controlled drugs; and are newly available, rath-er than newly invented. These substances may be the ac-tive pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used in authorised medicines (phenibut) or suspended/withdrawn medicines (sibutramine, DMAA) or potential medicines in the mak-ing (remimazolam). Methcathinone was originally used as an antidepressant in the former Soviet Union in the 1930s, but very quickly it became a recreational drug. Pyrova-lerone and amfepramone have been used as anorectics, but they are currently obsolete. Bupropion is used as antide-pressant and as an aid for those who wish to quit tobacco smoking. But NPS goes beyond APIs, in fact most of them come\u00a0originally\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0scientific\u00a0and\u00a0patent\u00a0literature\u00a0as\u00a0a result of Pharma and academic institutes\u2019 research and development efforts. They have been designed to evade drug laws, are widely available and have the potential to pose serious risks to public health and safety and can even be fatal. The short\u2010term harms of NPS can include para-noia, psychosis and seizures and their long\u2010term harms are often unknown. NPS a new class of psychoactive sub-stances, known as \u2018legal highs\u2019, \u2018herbal highs\u2019, \u2018designer drugs\u2019 or \u2018party pills\u2019 has emerged on the drug use market. They are frequently advertised as \u2018plant fertilizers/food\u2019, \u2018air fresheners\u2019, \u2018herbal incenses\u2019, \u2018spice\u2019, \u2018bath salts\u2019, \u2018re-search chemicals\u2019 (in Poland commonly known as \u2018dopal-acze\u2019 - literally translated as afterburners). Based on their chemical structures, designer drugs can\u00a0be\u00a0classified\u00a0 into\u00a0amphetamine\u00a0 types,\u00a02,5-dimethoxy\u00a0amphetamines,\u00a0 2,5-phenylamines,\u00a0 \u03b2-keto\u00a0 amphetamines\u00a0(cathinones), phencyclidines, piperazines, pyrrolidinophe-nones, fentanyls, piperidines, tryptamine derivatives and synthetic cannabinoids. Based on the spectrum of exert-ed\u00a0psychoactive\u00a0effects,\u00a0NPS\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0classified\u00a0into\u00a0four\u00a0ba-sic categories: synthetic cannabinoids, stimulants, opioid-like compounds, and hallucinogenic/dissociative (psycho-dysleptic); however, they may have a combination of these effects due to their designed chemical structure.From 2008 there has been a rapid increase in the num-ber and range of new substances with greater ease of avail-ability,\u00a0 with\u00a0 their\u00a0 open\u00a0 sale\u00a0 in\u00a0 offline\u00a0 retail\u00a0 outlets\u00a0 and\u00a0through the global marketplace of the internet (\u2018clearnet\u2019 and \u2018darkweb\u2019). The Early Warning System (EWS) run by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Ad-diction (EMCDDA) detected 86 novel NPS in 2013, 101 in 2014 and 100 in 2015. Whilst generally there has been an increase in the number of novel NPS detected, it is important to note that the vast majority are permutations of groups of similar sub-stances with similar effects (e.g. cathinones), or dissimilar substances that produce similar effects (e.g. synthetic can-nabinoids), rather than new distinct types of drugs. Fur-thermore,\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0likely\u00a0that\u00a0many\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0substances\u00a0identified\u00a0are not in widespread or even limited use. It may be that the market, to some extent, regulates itself with less effec-tive or more harmful NPS only being seen for very short periods of time or in a limited number of countries (Dar-PL 316Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 15 - 16 (2016)Zbigniew Fijalekgan and Wood, 2013;  Zawilska and Andrzejczak, 2015; Zawilska, 2015).Polish new drugs marketNew psychoactive substances were present on the Pol-ish drug scene before 2008. At the beginning, there were oc-casional sale offers of psychoactive substances on the Pol-ish Internet forums, which were in compliance with legal regulations at that time. In 2008, a website called \u2018dopalac-ze.com\u2019 was launched. It offered a new quality approach in terms of professional and marketing strategy. The website products were advertised as safe alternatives to illicit psy-choactive substances. One advertising slogan of \u2018dopalac-ze.com\u2019 emphasised the harmless effects of its products: \u2018Life is too short to take unhealthy pills\u2019. NPS were mar-keted as collectibles not intended for human consumption. They were described as legal in the European Union, con-trolled, regulated and safe. They were also marketed as the so-called \u2018party drugs\u2019. The shops also stocked herbal con-coctions, known for centuries in various cultures and used for a number of purposes including rituals e.g. Salvia divi-norum. It came as a big surprise to NPS users that herbal concoctions contained synthetic cannabinoids, which were to a large extent, if not wholly, responsible for the psycho-active effects thereof. In mid-2008, following the opening of\u00a0the\u00a0first\u00a0high\u00a0street\u00a0smart\u00a0shop,\u00a0trade\u00a0in\u00a0NPS\u00a0entered\u00a0the\u00a0reality\u00a0offline.\u00a0As\u00a0soon\u00a0as\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0end\u00a0of\u00a02008,\u00a040\u00a0high\u00a0street\u00a0smart shops were operational in the centers of major Pol-ish cities offering an increasingly wide range of psychoac-tive products. While describing the beginnings of the le-gal\u00a0highs\u00a0scene\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0worth\u00a0mentioning\u00a0a\u00a0first\u00a0synthetic\u00a0can-nabinoid\u00a0called\u00a0JWH-180,\u00a0which\u00a0was\u00a0identified\u00a0in\u00a0Poland\u00a0by the Central Forensic Laboratory in February 2009. This substance gave rise to a massive supply of such-like sub-stances on the Polish market. At the same time, other new psychoactive substances and products were arriving rapid-ly including synthetic cannabinoids, mephedrone and later on a whole range of cathinone-type substances. New smart shops started springing up exponentially and soon, by the end of 2010, 1 400 smart shops were up and running across the country. After the closure of high street smart shops by sanitary inspection, NPS kept being sold online (Jablonski and Malczewski, 2014).Unfortunately in next years, some shops have been re-opened and the situation regarding increased hospitaliza-tions in July 2015 was similar to that from 2010, so there-fore, it became necessary to develop a new orthogonal ap-proach\u00a0 to\u00a0 solve\u00a0 the\u00a0 problem\u00a0of\u00a0 identification\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 new\u00a0chemical structures appearing on the market by applying complementary techniques, i.e. LC-MS/MS-TOF, GS-MS/MS, LC-CAD and NMR. In December 2010 analysis of NPS samples collected by the sanitary inspection found seven main chemical groups; the highest incidences being MDPV (23%), and 16% for JWH-081 and RCS-4. From 2010 Polish National Medicines Institute have analyzed over 7000 various designer drugs and herbal highs prod-ucts.\u00a0About\u00a0160\u00a0psychoactive\u00a0compounds\u00a0were\u00a0identified\u00a0including: substituted cathinones, phenethylamines, syn-thetic cannabinoids, phenylpiperazines, tryptamines, phar-maceuticals and other. Poland still has one of the fastest growing market for new psychoactive substances in the EU with hundreds of hospitalizations resulting (approx. 1100 in 2013, 2000 in 2014 and 7000 in 2015).ConclusionsDesigner drugs present an ongoing challenge to chem-ists, toxicologists, and law enforcement agencies due to their dynamic and changing markets. To effectively com-bat the problems associated with designer drugs, a collec-tive effort needs to be in place from forensic scientists, health professionals, and law enforcement authorities. It is important to stay at the forefront of drug detection tech-niques\u00a0and\u00a0strategies\u00a0to\u00a0allow\u00a0speedy\u00a0identification\u00a0of\u00a0new\u00a0substances as they emerge. Metabolism and toxicity data need to be collected to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of designer drug intoxication. At the same time, drug sched-uling authorities need to schedule these drugs promptly to enable laws to be applied to the production, distribution, and consumption of these illicit substances to safeguard so-ciety.The global nature of the NPS phenomenon also pres-ents opportunities for enhanced international collabora-tion, and the importance of data sharing within the Euro-pean and international authorities. The Poland is currently an active participant in the European Early Warning Sys-tem on NPS and this network has proved useful in the ear-ly\u00a0identification\u00a0of\u00a0emerging\u00a0threats\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0area.\u00a0Sustained\u00a0collaboration in the future would not only continue to al-low the rapid exchange of information between countries but\u00a0also\u00a0the\u00a0potential\u00a0for\u00a0mutual\u00a0benefit\u00a0through\u00a0collabora-tion in research initiatives or through the sharing of refer-ence material and toxicological information.ReferencesDargan, P.I., Wood D.M., 2013.

Green \u201ccage\u201d nanocarriersWill be presented a few examples of \u201ccage\u201d nanopar-ticles composed of cyclodextrins (CDs) (Gref et al., 2006) or made of highly porous Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) (Horcajada et al., 2010). \u201cCage\u201dnanoparticles were produced by solvent-free green procedures such as microwave assisted hydrothermal synthesis. The nanopar-ticles were fully characterized to determine their chemi-cal composition, morphology, size distribution and specif-ic surface. Drug substances were encapsulated in the \u201ccages\u201d of these nanoparticles, thus ensuring optimal interactions with the matrices, leading to high loadings and controlled release properties.  Antibiotics, anticancer and antiviral drugs were load-ed simply by soaking the nanoparticles in aqueous solu-tions\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0drugs,\u00a0reaching\u00a0in\u00a0most\u00a0cases\u00a0efficiencies\u00a0close\u00a0to 100%. Remarkably, drugs with different physico-chem-ical properties could be co-encapsulated in different inter-connected cages inside the porous nanoparticles. Further-more, to achieve stable, versatile coatings on highly porous MOF nanoparticles without altering their ability to entrap molecules of interest, the outer surface of the nanoparticles was functionalized with CDs in a biofriendly, non-cova-lent manner (Agostoni et al. 2015). Versatile coatings were obtained in aqueous media, within a few minutes. Ligands could\u00a0be\u00a0coupled\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0shell,\u00a0to\u00a0ensure\u00a0specific\u00a0interaction\u00a0with cancer cells.The coatings were remarkably stable in cell culture media, despite their non-covalent nature.

Each step of the fabrication procedure (systhesis, drug encapsulation, coating) was performed in aqueous medium, at room temperature, without the need of cou-pling reagents nor protective surfactants.

Israel has benchmarked high in global NCD mortality and complications measures. Over the last two decades. These clinical improvements were supported by wide early adoption of Electronic Health Records through-out the country, all tiers of community care. Clalit is Israel\u2019s largest healthcare organization which serves as insurer/payer and integrated care provider for over half of the Israeli population \u2013 over 4.3 million peo-ple. Clalit has been leading innovative interventions using clinical data to drive people-centered targeted and effective care models, for NCD prevention and control.  In its strate-gic plans, Clalit aims to perform a paradigm shift to prop-erly deal with these challenges, transforming the health-care system to one which can bridge the silos of care pro-vision in a patient-centered approach, move from reactive therapeutic to proactive preventive care, and abandon our paternalistic narrative to a participatory and engaging pa-tient-physician relationship (Balicer et al., 2015; Leventer-Roberts et al., 2015; Feldman et al., 2014; Shadmi et al., 2015).We at Clalit believe that a key driving force and a pre-requisite for these changes is the availability and intelligent integrated use of EHR-based clinical data, and have been practicing innovative utilization of this data for quite a few years with successful measurable outcomes. Many of the unique innovative interventions introduced by Clalit are data-driven, made possible by real-time data provided to physicians and nurses, in an actionable, decision-support-ing format. Clalit has 100% (single software) Electronic Health Records coverage of ambulatory and hospital care, with an aggregated data warehouse that received feeds from both, on our 4.3 million members, for well over 1.5 decades. This data included detailed and full demographic (i.e. place of birth of person and parents), diagnoses (both EMRs and Claims), measures (i.e. as BMI, blood pres-sure), full laboratory test data, imaging data, patient report-ed such as smoking status and willingness to quit smoking, cost (pricelist and real-life monthly cost per patient), both prescription and dispensing medication data, and admin-istrative health services consumption data. These data are augmented in Clalit by the largest ongoing patient experi-ences survey performed in Israel, ongoing all year long to a very large patient sample, and an increasing amount of data becoming available through Clalit\u2019s patient portal and Per-sonal Health Record (PHR). Quality of care, patient expe-riences\u00a0and\u00a0financial\u00a0benchmarks\u00a0are\u00a0all\u00a0part\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0online\u00a0balanced scorecard system available to all managers at all levels of the organization. To turn this abundance of data into actionable insights, Clalit launched in 2010 its Research Institute, which now holds\u00a0over\u00a030\u00a0professionals\u00a0of\u00a0multidisciplinary\u00a0qualifica-tions \u2013 top notch clinicians, epidemiologists, biostatisti-cians, IT experts, algorithm specialists and public health experts. The institute associates gained invaluable expe-rience in mining and interpreting the organizational data-base, and creating tools introduced into policy and medi-cal practice. These tools allowed for implementing innova-tive clinical interventions to tackle key health issues such as reducing healthcare disparities, preventing avoidable re-admissions, tackling inadequate treatment adherence, as-sessing the impact of multi-morbidity, improving control PL 520Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 19 - 20 (2016)Ran Balicerof key chronic diseases, performing comparative effective-ness real-life studies and using predictive modeling and ad-vanced analytics to allow targeted care in high risk groups.

The Clalit Research Institute has focused in creating data-driven tools for enabling, supporting and assessing innovative clinical interventions to tackle key health and healthcare issues. These include including measuring and tackling inadequate treatment adherence, assessing and tackling the impact of NCDs and multi-morbidity, using predictive modeling and advanced analytics in the point of practice to allow targeted care in high risk groups, and comparative effectiveness real-life studies.In the presentation at this conference we will review the driving forces and the need for such disruptive inno-vations,\u00a0and\u00a0detail\u00a0specific\u00a0examples\u00a0 that\u00a0allowed\u00a0for\u00a0 re-ducing healthcare disparities, preventing avoidable read-missions, and improving control of key chronic diseases.

Advanced practice pharma-cists provide clinical services in primary care clinics ad-dressing common diseases (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipid-emia, COPD) and may have prescribing privileges under collaborative practice arrangements with physicians (Mu-rawski et al., 2011).To demonstrate specialized clinical knowledge beyond licensing standards increasingly more clinical pharmacists seek\u00a0national,\u00a0state\u00a0or\u00a0organization\u00a0certification\u00a0or\u00a0creden-tialing,\u00a0 in\u00a0specific\u00a0disease\u00a0state\u00a0management\u00a0(e.g.\u00a0antico-agulation, diabetes, poison information specialist) (CPP, 2012; Schommer et al., 2008). Survey results indicate that most clinical pharmacy specialists\u00a0are\u00a0extremely\u00a0satisfied\u00a0with\u00a0their\u00a0job\u00a0and\u00a0con-sider direct patient care, interaction with others, autono-my, practicing in a unique environment and applying their knowledge as very attractive aspects of their job. Howev-er, long hours (average work time/week 50.6 h) and heavy workload are challenges, yet also welcomed as stimuli for professional growth and innovative services (Schommer et al., 2008).Clinical pharmacy practice - newer trends Recent trends are clinical pharmacist involvement in ID subspecialties (i.e. HIV care, Hepatitis C disease, An-tibiotic Stewardship programs) and in Transition of Care, and respective practice guidelines have been published (ASHP, 2010; Hume et al., 2012; Schafer et al., 2016; SIDP, 2010).Pharmacist in HIV and hepatitis C management Management of HIV disease/AIDS and Hepatitis C provide excellent clinical pharmacy opportunities as both diseases are affecting millions of people, are predominant-PL 622Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 21 - 23 (2016)Dorothea Rudorfly chronic illnesses with major morbidity, known challeng-es (e.g. poor medication adherence, numerous drug relat-ed concerns) and new considerations (i.e. HIV in the aging population or pre-exposure prophylaxis, recent treatment options for hepatitis C, coinfections, high costs) (Schafer et al., 2016; Spooner, 2011). Pharmacist involvement in HIV/Hep C testing, treatment selection and monitoring, man-agement and prevention of drug-related problems, compli-cations or opportunistic infections, and education will pro-vide effective disease state management and optimal pa-tient support.Antimicrobial stewardship Antimicrobial Stewardship (AS) is another opportuni-ty for clinical pharmacists (ASHP, 2010; Dellit et al., 2007; MacKenzie et al., 2007). Data show that unnecessary and inappropriate prescription of antibiotics exposes patients to serious adverse drug effects and superinfections (i.e. Clos-tridium\u00a0 difficile);\u00a0 antibiotic\u00a0misuse\u00a0 is\u00a0 a\u00a0 critical\u00a0 factor\u00a0 in\u00a0rising antibiotic resistance and poses a public health threat (CDC, 2013). Regarding improvement of antibiotic use and patient safety as a national priority (CDC, 2013a), and based on evidence that designated programs can optimize treatment of infections and reduce adverse effects (Dav-ey et al., 2013; Ohl and Luther, 2011) the CDC in 2014 recommended that all hospitals implement AS programs (CDC, 2014). Designated ID pharmacist leaders collabo-rate with ID specialists in infection prevention and con-trol by tracking/optimizing antibiotic prescribing and use, reporting outcomes, implementing policies (i.e. \u201cantibiot-ic time out\u201d, IV to PO changes, dose adjustments) and ed-ucating clinicians.  Transition of careMajor medication errors can occur when patients are transferring between different care locations or lev-els (e.g. admission to, transfer or discharge from hospi-tal)\u00a0resulting\u00a0in\u00a0significant\u00a0adverse\u00a0drug\u00a0events,\u00a0increased\u00a0length of stay, high readmission rates and costs (Hume et al.,\u00a02012).\u00a0Official\u00a0organizations\u00a0(e.g.\u00a0US\u00a0Joint\u00a0Commis-sion, ASHP/APhA) (ASHP-APhA, 2013; Joint Commis-sion, 2012) have established national patient safety goals requiring accurate patient information in hospitals to pre-vent readmission rates, and potential payment penalties by insurers (Kristeller, 2014). Transition of Care (TOC) phar-macists plays an instrumental role in facilitating the pro-cess of continuing/coordinating therapeutic care (ACCP, 2008; ASHP-APhA, 2013; Hume et al., 2012). Obtaining patient medication histories, performing medication recon-ciliation, inpatient education, patient discharge counseling and post-discharge follow-up are key activities of the TOC pharmacist. Clinical pharmacy practice - future trends It is envisioned that most future clinical pharmacists (and all clinical faculty) will have post-graduate training, will\u00a0be\u00a0board-certified\u00a0specialists,\u00a0and\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0formally\u00a0rec-ognized and reimbursed as health care providers who en-sure optimal drug therapy outcomes (Gubbins et al., 2014; Saseen et al. 2006).Pharmacy faculty and pharmacists will work in in-terdisciplinary patient-centered medical homes (PCMH), where an entire team delivers comprehensive and coordi-nated health care (Smith et al., 2010; Zellmer, 2012) Phar-macists will provide medication therapy management uti-lizing health information technology and will engage in: handling, administering and monitoring of complex spe-cialty drugs and of medications delivered in innovative dosage forms (e.g. nanoscale devices); digitally moni-toring drug levels; and personalized medicine (Guglie-mo, 2015). Pharmacy education will need to prepare fu-ture clinical practitioners for these innovative and exciting professional practice opportunities (e.g. through interdisci-plinary education).ReferencesACCP,\u00a0 2008.\u00a0 The\u00a0 definition\u00a0 of\u00a0 clinical\u00a0 pharmacy.\u00a0Pharmacotherapy 28(6), 817-818. http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/commentaries/Clinpharmdefnfinal.pdf (accessed on 16.03.2016)ACCP, 2014.

Food intake, energy expenditure and body adiposity are homeostatical-ly regulated, and malfunctions of this balance can cause increased fat storage and obesity (Farooqi and O\u2019Rahilly, 2005;Murphy and Bloom, 2006). Mammals have two types of adipose tissue (fat): brown and white, with oppos-ing functions. Mammalian white fat is an important reg-ulator of the whole body homeostasis that stores energy in form of triglycerides. The brown adipose tissue catab-olises lipids to produce heat, function mediated by the tis-sue-specific\u00a0uncoupling\u00a0protein\u00a01\u00a0(Ucp1)\u00a0abundantly\u00a0pres-ent in the brown fat mitochondria. The brown adipose tis-sue differentiation can be induced by prolonged cold ex-posure and beta-adrenergic stimulation which leads to ele-vated intracellular cyclic AMP (Cannon  and Nedergaard, 2004; Young et al., 1984). The classical brown fat is pres-ent at distinct anatomical sites, including the interscapular, perirenal and axillary depots. Brown fat cells also emerge in subcutaneous white fat (known as \u201cbeige\u201d cells) in re-sponse to cold or exercise (Cousin et al., 1992; Guerra et al., 2001), a process referred to as fat \u201cbrowning\u201d. Promo-tion of increased brown fat development increases ener-gy expenditure and white fat loss, and leads to improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, without caus-ing dysfunction in other tissues and is associated with a lean and healthy phenotype (Lowell et al., 1993), suggest-ing the manipulation of the fat stores as an important ther-apeutic objective.Gut microbiota regulates metabolic homeostasisThegastrointestinal tract is the body\u2019s largest endo-crine organ that releases a number of regulatory peptide hormones\u00a0 that\u00a0 influence\u00a0 many\u00a0 physiological\u00a0 processes\u00a0(Badman and Flier, 2005). The intestinal microbiota co-develops\u00a0with\u00a0 the\u00a0host,\u00a0and\u00a0its\u00a0composition\u00a0is\u00a0 influenced\u00a0by several physiological changes (Koren et al., 2012; Rid-aura et al., 2013). The colonization starts immediately af-ter\u00a0birth\u00a0and\u00a0is\u00a0initially\u00a0defined\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0type\u00a0of\u00a0delivery\u00a0and\u00a0early feeding. A wide range of pathologies have been as-sociated with alterations of the gut microbial composition (e.g.: asthma, arthritis, autism or obesity) (Sommer and B\u00e4ckhed, 2013).\u00a0The\u00a0intestinal\u00a0microbiota\u00a0can\u00a0also\u00a0influ-ence the whole-body metabolism by affecting energy bal-ance (B\u00e4ckhed et al., 2004; Koren et al., 20012; Ridaura et al., 2013; Turnbaugh et al., 2006). Transplantation of mi-crobiota from obese human, or animal donors to germ free mice\u00a0is\u00a0sufficient\u00a0to\u00a0promote\u00a0increased\u00a0adiposity\u00a0and\u00a0insu-lin resistance of the new host, suggesting that microbiota alone\u00a0is\u00a0sufficient\u00a0to\u00a0induce\u00a0these\u00a0metabolic\u00a0changes.\u00a0The\u00a0mechanisms and the nature of the phenotypic and morpho-logical alterations that regulate the energy homeostasis of the new host following microbiota transplantation remain poorly understood.Our\u00a0recent\u00a0findings\u00a0show\u00a0that\u00a0cold\u00a0exposure\u00a0leads\u00a0to\u00a0marked shift of the microbiota composition, referred to as cold microbiota (Chevalier et al., 2015). Transplantation of\u00a0 the\u00a0 cold\u00a0microbiota\u00a0 to\u00a0 germ-free\u00a0mice\u00a0 is\u00a0 sufficient\u00a0 to\u00a0increase insulin sensitivity of the host, and enable toler-ance to cold partly by promoting the white fat browning, leading to increased energy expenditure and fat loss. Dur-ing prolonged cold however, the body weight loss is at-PL 726Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 25 - 26 (2016)Mirko Trajkovskitenuated, caused by adaptive mechanisms maximizing ca-loric uptake and increasing intestinal, villi and microvil-li lengths. This increased absorptive surface is transferable with the cold microbiota leading to altered intestinal gene expression promoting tissue remodelling and suppression of apoptosis - effect diminished by co-transplanting the most cold-downregulatedbacterial strain Akkermansiamu-ciniphila during the cold microbiota transfer. Our results demonstrate the microbiota as a key factor orchestrating the overall energy homeostasis during increased demand ((Chevalier et al., 2015). We recently also showed that the development of functional beige fat is promoted by micro-biota depletion either by means of antibiotic treatment or in germ-free mice within the white adipose tissues (Su\u00e1rez-Zamorano et al., 2015). This leads to improved glucose tol-erance, insulin sensitivity and decreased white fat and ad-ipocyte size in lean mice and obese mice. Such metabolic improvements\u00a0are\u00a0mediated\u00a0by\u00a0eosinophil\u00a0infiltration\u00a0and\u00a0enhanced type 2 cytokine signaling and M2 macrophage polarization in the white fat depots of microbiota-deplet-ed animals. The metabolic phenotype and the browning of the subcutaneous white fat are impaired by suppression of the type 2 signaling and are reversed by recolonization of the antibiotic-treated, or the germ-free mice with microbes (Su\u00e1rez-Zamorano et al., 2015). These results provide in-sights into the microbiota-fat signaling axis and the beige fat development in health and metabolic disease. The re-duced adiposity, and improved glucose tolerance and insu-lin sensitivity of the microbiota depleted obese animalssug-gestthat browning of the white fat depots by modulation of the microbiota composition could be a new approach for combatingobesity and the associated metabolic disorders. ConclusionMicrobiota transplantation was reported almost 50 years ago, and has re-gained interest as a treatment option for several pathologies. In the context of the increased obe-sity prevalence and energy unbalance, our studies show-ing microbiota changes that promote fat browning, weight loss and increased energy dissipation, imply microbiota as a key player mediating the tight control of the energy ho-meostasis with large therapeutic potential.ReferencesB\u00e4ckhed, F., Ding, H., Wang, T., Hooper, L.V., Koh, G.Y., Nagy, A., Semenkovich, C.F. and Gordon, J.I. 2004.The gut microbiota as an environmental factor that regulates fat storage.

This is especially true for the biggest supercomputers in the world, showing off their exa-FLOPS, aggregating peta-bytes of data, measuring and comparing each other on several top charts (Filiposka et al., 2016).  But is this their real power? If we compare the best of the best from only 23 years ago (at the time the first\u00a0top500\u00a0(Top500)\u00a0list\u00a0was\u00a0published),\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0todays\u00a0list leader, there is more than 400000 times increase in the peak performance capabilities. One can have all the exas and petas in the world, but the true power of todays supercomputers is in their applicability to solve real life problems. VI-SEEM (VI-SEEM) is one of the examples of trying to put the supercomputers to work on practical problems. It tries to facilitate regional interdisciplinary collaboration,\u00a0 focusing\u00a0 on\u00a0 the\u00a0 scientific\u00a0 communities\u00a0 of\u00a0Life Sciences, Climatology and Digital Cultural Heritage.

Bridging the two worlds would bring new value and improve research productivity and competitiveness on the pan-European level. The general project objective is to provide integrated e-Infrastructure platform for regional cross-border Scientific\u00a0Communities\u00a0in\u00a0Climatology,\u00a0Life\u00a0Sciences,\u00a0and\u00a0Cultural Heritage for the SEEM region that will be user-friendly and accessible to the fore mentioned communities. This goal will be achieved by linking compute, data, and visualization resources, as well as services, models, software and tools. This Virtual Research Environment - VRE will provide the scientists and researchers with the support in full lifecycle of collaborative research: accessing and sharing relevant research data, using it with provided codes and tools to carry out new experiments and simulations on large-scale e-Infrastructures, and producing new knowledge and data - which can be stored and shared in the same VRE. Through training, user support, application development and porting, the researchers will be able to truly utilize the power of the regional e-infrastructure, to try to solve realistic problems, including computer aided drug delivery, modelling of biomolecules, introduction of novel methodologies into drug development, regional genotype databases development are only a few of the possible applications. Our expectations are that this and similar projects will actually bridge the gap between the computing power and its real applications, for a healthier world and better living.VI-SEEM for life sciencesAdvances in computational infrastructure during the last decade have facilitated the development of biological data analysis for big data and computational biology as key research methodologies in both academia and industry. The use of computers in biology has enabled our better understanding of mechanistic aspects in health and disease and has accelerated the development PL 828Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 27 - 29 (2016)Anastas Mishevof novel therapeutics. In this project, the Life Sciences research community is chosen because of its central role in achieving a higher quality of life in the SEEM region. The aim of the VRE is to create and provide the necessary services over a capable infrastructure to facilitate research for understanding of disease mechanisms and appropriate mitigation methodologies in the SEE and EM populations. Project participants and related institutes will assist in data collection and analysis, run and optimizing computational codes and using the research results to understand the molecular basis of diseases associated with SEE and EM areas with projections to develop personalized therapies. The Life Sciences research community in the SEEM region\u00a0 could\u00a0 benefit\u00a0 greatly\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 e-infrastructures\u00a0 at\u00a0hand. Large amounts of data need to be stored and be made available to researchers for processing in the compute centres of the region. Therefore, apart from storage resources, fast and reliable networking infrastructure is important for moving large datasets from data archives to the computing centres and also moving simulation results to the researchers\u2019 facilities for further post processing and acquisition of results. In terms of compute infrastructure, the models and services to be used by the research groups require capacity and capability computing as well as the provision of computing resources for the installation of user facing services. For example, codes such as NAMD and NWCHEM scale up to hundreds or thousands of cores\u00a0 and\u00a0 can\u00a0 benefit\u00a0 from\u00a0 scalable\u00a0 HPC\u00a0 clusters\u00a0 or\u00a0supercomputers such as the IBMs BlueGene. Molecular dynamics applications are also known to perform well on GPU systems, while also are being ported to new Intel\u2019s Phi accelerator platform. On the other hand, parametric codes\u00a0 for\u00a0 human\u00a0 genome\u00a0 sequence\u00a0 analysis\u00a0 can\u00a0 benefit\u00a0greatly from the Grid or Cloud IaaS computing model. Finally, user-facing services can be also installed in the IaaS infrastructure that will be available in the project. It\u00a0 is\u00a0evident\u00a0 that\u00a0 the\u00a0Life\u00a0Sciences\u00a0Scientific\u00a0Community\u00a0requires a variety of infrastructure resources all of which are going to be available in the VI-SEEM VRE.Life science use casesSome most important and most representative examples of using the regional e-Infrastructure for the needs of the Life Science VRE include:\u2022\t Modelling and Molecular Dynamics (MD) study of proteins, membrane proteins and biological model membranes. These three biomolecular entities are responsible for signal transduction and are important drug targets. Therefore, in order to design more efficient\u00a0 drugs\u00a0 and\u00a0 drug\u00a0 delivery\u00a0 systems,\u00a0 a\u00a0 better\u00a0understanding of the physicochemical interactions that govern biomembrane and protein interfaces is needed.\u2022\t Computational simulation of DNA and RNA to enable studying\u00a0 the\u00a0 influence\u00a0 of\u00a0 thermodynamic\u00a0 properties\u00a0of the DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA duplexes on the transcription and processing of RNA.

By using computational methods and the 3D structural information of the protein target, we are now able to investigate the detailed underlying molecular and atomic interactions involved in ligand: protein interactions and thus interpret experimental results in detail. \u2022\t Image processing for biological applications includes experiments by spinning disk confocal microscopy of living cell, which generate images of dozens of GBs per experiment. The generated images require extensive image processing, such as registration, deconvolution, volume rendering, surface rendering, object detection, measurement of shape, size, and intensity of cell objects and automatic object movement tracking of the living cell in 3 dimensions and time.\u2022\t Analysis of Next Generation DNA sequencing data to identify disease mechanism pathways and provide patients with timely diagnosis, assessment of risk for developing\u00a0the\u00a0disease,\u00a0targeted\u00a0and\u00a0efficient\u00a0therapy,\u00a0and give support for possible future reproduction planning.\u2022\t Synchrotron data analysis: SESAME is a 3rd generation synchrotron light source that produces very intense pulses of light/X-rays, with wave lengths and intensities that allow detailed studies of objects ranging in size from human cells, through viruses down to atoms, with a precision that is not possible by other means.The list above is does not limit the possible usage of the resources, only provides some current and ongoing efforts in using the computational, networking and storage infrastructure to aid the Life Science research communities. The research into computer aided drug design will be given a strong focus during the project, both from the LS researchers, but also from the infrastructure support point of view.  Through advances in the drug delivery modelling, novel and hybrid methodologies (Markova et al., 2015) such as molecular dynamics, statistical physics, Monte Carlo etc. will be compared to the traditional methodologies, enabling better understanding of the processes at a very small scale. Through computer aided molecular design (Ng et al., 2015), the simulation results are\u00a0 expected\u00a0 to\u00a0 significantly\u00a0 reduce\u00a0 the\u00a0 clinical\u00a0 trials\u00a0 in\u00a0anticancer drug research (Kim et al., 2013). ConclusionEnabling access to e-Infrastructure through intuitive and\u00a0 user\u00a0 friendly\u00a0 interfaces\u00a0 could\u00a0 bring\u00a0 great\u00a0 benefit\u00a0 to\u00a0the research communities in the SEE and EM regions. Through virtual collaborative environment, these communities can achieve research excellence on the pan-European and global level.

Non-adherence to prescribed medication is very common, with approximately half of the patients failing to adhere to the medication regimen. It a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon that involves factors associated with the med-ication, patient, provider and health system, and thus can-not be addressed with single effort interventions (Oster-berg et al., 2015).Poor adherence to medication regimens has been as-sociated with poor medical outcomes over a range of diag-noses, associated with avoidable admissions costs of $100 Billion a year, in the US alone. Moreover, patient non-ad-herence is a growing legal concern (Cutler, 2010). In one review, five percent of malpractice cases cite patient non-compliance as a contributing factor, with over a third of these resulting in payment to the plaintiff.The opportunity in integrated EMR-driven databases Integrated large clinical datasets offer a unique oppor-tunity to assess the magnitude and impact of the non-adher-ence phenomenon. In the case studies we will discuss, we used data from Clalit - Israel\u2019s largest healthcare organiza-tion which serves as insurer/payer and integrated care pro-vider for over half of the Israeli population \u2013 over 4.3 mil-lion people. Clalit holds abundance of real-time data pro-vided to physicians and nurses, in an actionable, decision-supporting format. Clalit has 100% (single software) Elec-tronic Health Records coverage of ambulatory and hospi-tal care, with an aggregated data warehouse that received feeds from both, on all its members, for well over 1.5 de-cades. This data included detailed and full demographic, diagnoses (both EMRs and Claims), measures, full labora-tory test data, imaging data, patient reported such as smok-ing status and willingness to quit smoking, cost, both pre-scription and dispensing medication data, and administra-tive health services consumption data. The case of statins adherence Statins, as one of the most widely-prescribed medica-tions with proven preventive efficacy, have a single indica-tion and are given long term, and thus are a simple candi-date drug to assess adherence patterns. In one study we de-termined the proportion of patients prescribed statins who never fill a prescription, identified who they are, and com-pared their LDL control to adherent and non-adherent pa-tients. The methods included a retrospective examination among patients prescribed a statin in 2008 and followed through 2010 in Clalit. Statin adherence in patients over age 21 was tracked for 2 years utilizing a new, validated adherence measure based on both written and dispensed prescriptions. Adherence below 20% was considered non-adherence. In this study, we found a total of 67,517 patients received 1,386,270 written prescriptions over the 3-year period. While a traditional adherence measure identified 8000 patients as non-adherent, a prescription+dispensing adherence measure identified 19,000 patients as low ad-herence patients. Thus, 1 in 6 patients prescribed statins would be overlooked using existing adherence methodolo-gies. Changes in LDL levels of non-adherent patients were 11.9-14.1 mg/dl, compared to 48.3 mg/dl, p<0.001 in ad-herent patients. We thus concluded that non-adherence to statins was a very prevalent problem \u2013 more than we have previously assessed, as a large proportion of low-adher-ence patients may have been overlooked unless full data (prescriptions and dispensing) was available for adherence assessment (Singer et al., 2015).S1 OP 934Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 33 - 34 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsThe case of hypoglycemic drugs adherence In another study we assessed the attributable impact of adherence to oral glucose medications as a risk factor for poor glycemic control using Clalit\u2019s electronic health re-cords data.Adherence to diabetes medications over a two-year period was calculated by prescription-based Med-ication Possession Ratios for adults with diabetes diag-nosed before January 1, 2010. Glycemic control was de-termined by the HbA1c test closest to the last drug pre-scription during 2010\u20132012. Poor control was defined as HbA1c>75 mmol/mol (9.0%). Medication adherence was categorized as \u201cgood\u201d (>80%), \u201cmoderate\u201d (50\u201380%), or \u201cpoor\u201d (<50%). Among 228,846 diabetes patients treated by oral anti-glycemic medication, 46.4% had good, 28.8% had moder-ate, and 24.8% had poor adherence. Good adherence rates increased with increasing disease duration, while glycemic control became worse. We used logistic regression models to assess the role medication adherence plays in the asso-ciation between disease duration, age, and poor glycemic control. There was a strong inverse association between ad-herence level and poor control (OR = 2.50; CI = 2.43\u20132.58), and adherence was a significant mediator between age and poor control.While poor adherence does not mediate the poorer glycemic control seen in patients with longer-stand-ing disease, it was a significant mediator of poor glycemic control among younger diabetes patients. A greater frac-tion of poorly controlled younger patients (up to one third of them), compared to older patients, could be prevented if at least 80% adherence to their medications was achieved. Therefore, these results suggest that interventions to im-prove adherence should focus on this younger sub-group (Feldman, 2014).The case of anti-depressantsIn another study we aimed to uncover the impact of adherence to anti-depressant medications (AD) treatment on all-cause mortality. We performed a four-year histori-cal prospective cohort of a total of 251,746 patients aged above 40 years old who were prescribed AD at least once during 2008-2011. Patients were stratified into: non-adher-ence (<20%), poor (20%-50%), moderate (50% - 80%), and good (>80%) adherence levels. Adherence was mea-sured as a continuous variable representing possession ra-tio (duration of claimed AD divided by duration of pre-scribed AD). The association between adherence and Haz-ard Ratio (HR) for mortality follow a quadratic model in which the lowest HR (0.66 [95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.64 to 0.69]) is at a level of 60% adherence in respect to non-adherence, and leveled off as compared to higher ad-herence. This shows again that adherence to AD is signifi-cantly associated with a corresponding decrease in the risk of mortality, controlling for relevant covariates. Thus phy-sicians from all disciplines should actively improve their patients\u2019 adherence to AD since their persistent use is asso-ciated with increased survival (Krivoy et al., 2016).SummaryOur data from these multiple case study suggests that non-adherence is a frequent, impactful phenomenon, which exists across clinical domains and drives control challenges in chronic illness care. In the presentation at this conference we will also review the profound changes brought in the potential of information technology and dig-ital health to allow innovative interventions that may ad-dress low rates of medication adherence and the multiple inadequacies in current healthcare systems that drive it. We will discuss medication adherence tracking, using patient health records to engage patients, cost-related aspects of non-adherence and discuss what approaches have shown success and/or promise in addressing this high-impact uni-versal health challenge.

The motivation to analyze this particular legislative measure within a single mid-size country is in its compre-hensiveness and in its unique approach toward marketing authorization holders (MAHs). Moreover, recent econom-ic crisis is making such a \u00bblaboratory of cost-containment tools\u00ab attractive for authorities and payers not only among the Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, but also among Western (e.g., EU-15) jurisdictions. Final rea-son for the analysis is availability of detailed data on Hun-garian prescription drug market, which are provided to the public by the authorities. While the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF-OEP) data provide strong evidence that the PEA resulted in cost-containment of the public expenditure for prescription drugs in Hungary,  cost-contaninment itself, however, may not lead to efficiencies either in the prescription drug mar-ket, let alone in the overall healthcare market. As it is well known, cost-containment may stifle innovation, thereby re-ducing the dynamic efficiency; on the other hand, price re-ductions of off-patent drugs and their generic versions may be insufficent, allowing their prices to remain way above the marginal cost of production and thus promoting static inefficiencies.Static efficiencyTo assess static efficiency, we examined risperidone group (ATC5 group N05AX08). Risperidone group is a suitable proxy for genericized therapeutic group at the time of introduction of the PEA. Risperidone faced expiry of its intellectual property right (IPR) at the end of 2005, however, in this particular case, the branded firm was unable to follow the price de-crease due to the fact that the IPR was still in power in EU-15 jurisdictions and Hungarian price could thereby have a potential detrimental spill-over effect via international ref-erence pricing. To prevent complete loss of revenue, the branded firm launched in 2006 its own authorized generic drug in cooperation with the local partner; in 2008, the lo-cal partner launched its own generic, completely abandon-ing marketing of the authorized generic. After the introduction of PEA, public expenditure per mg of risperidone decreased in 2008 from 162.7 HUF (\u20ac0.54) to 101 HUF (\u20ac0.33) for a branded drug and from 155.2 HUF (\u20ac0.51) to 92.5 HUF (\u20ac0.3) for authorized ge-neric drug. In 2008, public expenditure per mg of risper-idone fell further to 37.1 HUF (\u20ac0.12) for authorized ge-neric drug. The co-payment per mg increased sharply in 2007 due to the PEA; having in mind that patients suffer-ing from schizophrenia typically poorly adhere to the treat-ment, such an increase could present potential adherence risk. However, since the average daily dose of risperidone is 4.7 mg, the monthly co-payment would be in total ap-proximately 340 HUF (\u20ac1.1), unlikely a financial issue even for such a socially disadvantaged patient group. As we have observed earlier with atorvastatin, price of generic risperidone initially dropped rapidly (by 76% from 2006 to 2008), but in 2009 and 2010 remained virtually unchanged. If we take cost of goods sold (COGS) at 10% of the mo-nopoly price as the rough estimate of marginal cost of pro-duction, for a typical branded small molecule launched in 1990s then the potential for further price reduction does exist. Public expenditure with included 12%-rebate was in 2010 for risperidone relatively modest \u2013 871 million HUF (\u20ac2.8 million) \u2013 yet could still be reduced by about 60%.  S1 OP 1036Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 35 - 36 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsDynamic efficiencyTo assess dynamic efficiency, we examined a line ex-tension of oral risperidone, which was launched by the branded firm at the end of 2004. This incrementally modi-fied product, however, reached way beyond the usual \u00bbev-ergreening strategies\u00ab of branded firms as the product pre-sented the first long-acting atypical antipsychotic (admin-istered once every 2 weeks) and thus addressed the issue of adherence of patients suffering from schizophrenia and as-sociated higher hospitalization rates and costs. The brand-ed firm entered in 2005 into price-volume agreement with NHIF-OEP, which was renewed in 2008. In spite of the controlled nature of growth, the long acting atypical an-tipsychotic achieved in Hungary diffusion which was globally surpassed only by Spain; in April 2011, its mar-ket share in the total antipsychotic market (N05A) was 23.7% (vs 26.7% in Spain, 17.1% in France, 13.4% in It-aly, 10.9% in Germany and 6.8% in the United Kingdom) (IMS, 2011). One of the former top ranking NHIF-OEP of-ficials mentioned that in his opinion, \u00bbmajority of patients should be treated by long-acting atypical antipsychotic\u00ab and thus corroborated the fact that Hungarian authorities did not oppose the novel technologies in spite of the over-all framework of cost-containment.As with oral risperi-done, co-payment surged in 2007 and the absolute amount has been with average monthly dose of 75 mg around 525 HUF (\u20ac1.7), which is as with oral risperidone likely not ex-cessive. In fact, OEP's own publication found no impact of co-payments on adherence of patients with schizophrenia; another former NHIF-OEP official claimed that in 2006 \u00bb25% of schizophrenic patients were treated with two or more atypical antipsychotics, which was clearly a waste of resources\u00ab.   ConclusionsNHIF-OEP managed to sharply decrease expenditure for risperidone by implementing the PEA in January 2007. The cost-containment policies did not exclude innovation: an example of a long acting atypical antipsychotic suggests that Hungarian prescription market under the PEA has en-abled diffusion of new technologies, on at least per-capi-ta basis comparable to those of G-5 countries. An obvious inefficiency is that the PEA was still financing excessive rents for off-patent drugs, which remain a global challenge for payers. The Hungarian off-patent market reinforces in particular the general notion that regulating generic prices may lead to price convergence and inefficiencies and that generic competition is not sufficiently fierce in regulated environment. Our study has some obvious limitations as we have examined a limited number of products and one might well find the product or a group of products which would deviate from our conclusions.ReferenceIMS, 2011.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* zost@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionParallel trade of pharmaceuticals in European Union (EU) started in the \u201870s as a process in which licensed phar-maceutical distributor in any EU member state can, after obtaining proper authorization, import any drug from an-other member state, so long as the drug that is being import-ed is identical to the drug that is locally sourced, that is, it contains the same active ingredient and is produced by the same manufacturer (Kanavos et al., 2005). Since the middle \u201890s the share of parallel trade grew up to 7-17%, especially in countries like Denmark, Sweden, United Kingdom, Ger-many and the Netherlands. This process is based on the ex-istence of heterogeneous price regulation systems among different countries in EU. Parallel trade of pharmaceuticals is legal within the EU based on the principle of free move-ment of goods laid down in Article 28 of the EC Treaty to create a single market. However, it is subject to restrictions to protect industrial and commercial property and human life and health, according to Article 30 (Ginter et al., 2005). Representatives of the parallel trader\u2019s consumers and pa-tients while converging prices between different geographic markets and thereby harmonizing the markets for pharma-ceutical products. Representatives of the pharmaceutical in-dustry, on the other hand, claim that parallel trade (or \u201cgray market trade\u201d) is nothing more than free riding, or piggy-backing, on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 profits and thereby condemning innovation by reducing the ability and willing-ness to invest in research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), while at the same time distorting the supply chain of drugs in low-price countries, which makes availability of certain drugs uncertain for patients (Nilsson, 2013).In the previous year\u2019s parallel trade originally was concentrated on the most important patented products, but now the situation is a different and this process has extend-ed to a wider range of pharmaceutical products. The main problem generated within the parallel trade in CEE coun-tries is a drug shortage. Namely these countries realize the greatest export of drugs resulting in hampering the access to drugs for the local patients. Republic of Macedonia (RM) as a associate member of the EU is not a part of parallel trade process. There is a similar process named parallel import of drugs. The paral-lel import of medicines is legally defined and basically it is a modification of the procedure for parallel trade in med-icines in the EU Member States. According to our law, PI is import of such medical products that has medical au-thorization in the R.M under import license issued by the Drug agency from the referent countries, when the import-er is not appointed by the MA holder (national decision). The term \u201cParallel\u201d implies that the MP is imported via pathways that are different to the established one (desig-nated by manufacturer or its original supplier), as competi-tive channels that are active in the same time/parallely. The countries that are chosen as the reference for the registra-tion of drugs are also chosen as the reference countries for parallel importation. Those countries are: EU Countries, USA, Japan, Switzerland, Canada. Russia and Turkey are added as two another counties to this list. This fact was rea-son for development of two different and opposing views on the feasibility of introducing of the parallel importation of medicines in our country. On one side was the attitude of some experts and the representatives of the pharmaceu-tical companies, first of all the innovative pharmaceutical companies, according to which this process will lead to the possibility for the emergence of the counterfeit drugs that will affect the quality of the medicines, the safety in their S1 OP 1138Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 37 - 38 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsuse and will be the reason for the closure of the representa-tive offices of these companies and the withdrawal of reg-istration files for these drugs from our country. On the oth-er side was the attitude of the managing persons from the Ministry of Health according to whom this process will lead to increased competition, lower drug prices and the proposed legislation and prevent the occurrence of drugs of dubious quality pharmaceutical market. The aim of this article is to present the effects of par-allel trade/import in the pharmaceutical markets in CEE countries.MethodsTraditional legal search methods were used for iden-tification of impact of parallel trade/import on CEE coun-tries. A literature search was carried out in the PubMed da-tabases, ISPOR databases, Google Scholar and on official web sites of regulatory bodies from CEE countries. A fol-lowing combination of key words has been used: paral-lel trade and pharmaceuticals and Central East European Countries or medicines.Results and discussionThe share of parallel imports in EU increased contin-ually due to a growing focus on specialty drugs (oncology, hematology products, HIV- and CNS-therapeutics) and the capping of price differences at 15 euros per package worth 100 euros or more. The annual turnover of more than 100 parallel traders in 2015 was 5.5 billion in Europe. The par-allel trade as a process has some negative effects for the CEE countries. The main is the problem of drug shortage in the countries with smaller prices of medicinal products. Medications imported on other markets come mainly from these countries. They are exported from those particular countries in large numbers, thus hampering the access to drugs for the local patients, causes delays in bringing prod-ucts to market. For example, the parallel import market of medicinal products in Poland in 2005 was 0.01% of the pharmaceutical market with 40 licenses for this procedure, in 2009 was already 0.7% with 308 licenses, and only in the first three quarters by 2010 it reached nearly 1.1% (Re-ligioniand Czerw, 2012). In Czech Republic the parallel export of medicines is around 185 Mil. \u20ac in 2015 (Skoup\u00e1, 2016). The oncology drugs are accounted for about 30% of exports in values. In Slovakia, the problem is particularly acute. The medicines price regulation makes Slovakia an attractive destination to buy cheap medicines and export them abroad. Drug sales in Slovakia amount to about \u20ac1 billion annually, with re-exports making up as much as 30 percent of the revenue. In Greece in 2012 parallel exports accounted for around 500 million euros of the total value of the pharmaceutical market. During the economic crisis in 2014 the situation it became worst. Based on this situ-ation the Greek government has announced a provisional ban on the parallel exporting of 34 innovative medicines as a emergency measure. Faced with this problem CEE coun-tries from begging of 2013 have been started with intro-ducing of new legal measures to monitor and restrict par-allel exports. Slovakia\u2019s parallel trade-restricting law has served as the model for a similar regulation introduced in Bulgaria, Romania and Estonia latter. In R. Macedonia in the previous 2 years period almost 350 different drugs have obtained parallel import authori-zation. The list includes drugs which are used in oncology, neurology, hematology daily practice, drugs for treatment of respiratory disease, interferons, insulins. List is getting wider and wider. These are drugs that mostly belong to the group of originator medicines and are intended for the hos-pital usage. But, on the list you can also find generic drugs. In this period parallel importation of medicines in Mace-donia led to a reduction in drug prices and to the savings in the health system, while the occurrence of counterfeit med-icines and disorders in the quality of imported products are not recorded for now. Based on the data from Ministry of health, to date the total savings enabled through the parallel importation of drugs in RM is 14 million euros.ReferencesCarri, G., 2005.

The Agency of Medicines regulated the prices of 2700 registered drugs placed on the market in the R. of Macedonia on three levels: unique wholesale price, unique retail price and defined wholesale and retail mark-ups. In December 2011, after a series of attempts to perform regulatory pricing pressure on importers and manufacturers of drugs, the Agency has introduced a new Methodology (Official Gazette of RM No. 156/11, 2011). Core data on the price reductions of the registered drugs were provided by the Macedonian Agency of Medicines. Data are covering the period 2012-2015, during which 8 revisions were made. For the workflow control of the computer model and in order to produce data analysis we have used the programming language Python v3.5. Microsoft Excel was used for additional statistical analysis. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the result of the implementation of the new Methodology in Macedonia. ResultsThe introduction of the new Methodology and its implementation by the Agency for the period 2012-2015 resulted in price decrease of 1386 drugs (including all available registered dosage forms) out of total 2178. In total 680 drugs were lowered by more than 10%. The major price reduction happened in 2014, followed by reductions in 2015, 2012 and 2013. Furthermore, the analysis of the average price changes of the drugs shows that after initial 13% decrease of the prices in 2012, significant percentage of reductions was registered in 2013, followed by declining dynamics in 2014 and 2015. For objective research reasons we extended our analysis and grouped the pharmaceutical and dosage forms of the drugs. The results shows that since the introduction of the new Methodology until October 2015, a total of 843 drugs with the same INN have reduced prices. Major decrease by generics has been registered in 2014, in total of 355 generic drugs, followed by 2015 with 307 drugs, 2012 with 125 drugs and 56 in 2013. Our next focus was on averaging the percentages of price reduction of evaluated drugs. The results show that the major decrease of 23% was in 2013, followed by 18.4% decrease in 2014, 17.8% in 2012 and 10.8% in 2015. For more precise calculations we have used iterative calculation of the changes of the same generics year over year (YoY). By this same analysis, we have found that major price decrease were registered on glimepiride 88%, fluconazole 87%, ramipril 82%, bicalutamide 80%, torasemide 77% etc. Detailed analysis of the dynamics of price reduction of the drugs with the same INN shows that major reduction of the prices took place in 2014, when the price of 355 drugs was lowered, with over 32 drugs lowered by 30% or more. Second biggest price reduction took place in 2015 when 307 of the drugs have lowered price, but with lower dynamics of reductions compared to previous years. Moreover, the analysis clearly shows that in 2012, a total of 125 drugs with the same INN have lower prices with 12 drugs lowered on average by 30% or more. Finally, the lowest number of reduced prices of drugs was in 2013 (56 drugs in total), but with the highest average dynamic of reductions of 23% for the period 2012-2015. The average price change was the lowest in 2015 with reductions of only 10.8%, in 2012 with 17.74% and in 2014 with 18.4%. S1 OP 1240Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 39 - 40 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsObviously the dynamics of the average price changes of the drugs with the same INN is slowing down YoY, considering the fact that in most of the cases the price reductions are affecting the same generic groups.  Next segment we have focused on was the evaluation of the drugs by the ATC code. Since the introduction of the new Methodology, major price reduction was registered in the Group L with total of 180 drugs and average price decrease of 27%. Next was Group N with a total of 123 generic drugs and an average price decrease of 19%. Group J with 119 drugs and average price reduction of 29% is \u201cthe leader\u201d in terms of the relative number of generic drugs and the size of the price reductions. Finally, Group C where the price of total of 69 drugs was lowered in range between 77% and 10%. What is also noticeable is that the average price reduction in this ATC code group is 27%. 2012 tendencies by ATC classification show that the prices of a total of 119 drugs were reduced with average size of 26%. Major price decrease in 2012 by number of generic drugs was registered in Group N and by percentage of reduction in the Groups A and L. In the following year the price of a total of 63 generic drugs by ATC code was reduced with highest average decrease of 28% with major number of drugs in the Groups J, C, A and Group N. 2014 was the year of major changes concerning the number of a total of 276 generic drugs with reduced price by 27.7% as well as dynamics. Major developments are in Group L, with a decrease ranging from 51% to 24%. Second major changes were registered in Group M, reductions of 46% to 22%, Group J with a changes ranging between 58% and 10%, and Group N with a range of reductions between 64% and 11%. In 2015 the price of a total of 197 generic drugs was reduced with major decrease in the Group J with 51%, Group N with 46%, S with 44%, Group H with 35%, Group M with 32% and, Group N with 30% decrease. Finally we have analysed the ratios between the price reductions and the quantities sold by inserting on X axis average percentages of price reduction calculated by the use of iterative approach and on Y axis sales for 2015 given the year 2012 as basis with 100 points level. The result was a downward slope at rate -0.83x which confirms that the price reduction leads to declining sales of the generic drugs. It is noticeable that out of total 118 generic drugs with lowered prices for the period 2012-2015, in the year 2015 a total of 31 generic drugs have zero sales. Furthermore, 50 out of 118 in 2015 have higher sales than in 2012, but only 19 have increased sale of over 10%. Remaining 31 generic drugs have increase of sale sizing below 10%.  Major part of the sales increase was registered for those generic drugs whose price was reduced by approximately 40%, but with the average size of sales stagnating in the range between 100 and 120 level. Finally we have analyzed the price-quantities changes for the period 2012-2015 by dividing the drugs with registered sale increase, and drugs with lowered sales after the prices were reduced. Contrary to the expectations, the group of drugs above level 100 has declining tendency of sale, which reflects the drop in the sales as consequence of continuous price reduction. In the second group, stagnation of the sales quantities is evident (y=0.1x). By excluding the zero sales drugs for the period 2012-2015, we came to the conclusion that the price reductions of generic drugs have insignificantly increased the sales of the drugs, whereby most of the drugs are bellow or on the levels of 2012.ConclusionThe introduction of the new Methodology in 2011 may look like a win-win solution in which the prices of number of drugs have been reduced, which is preferred policy target of the governments, and the patients have access to cheaper drugs. However, the price reductions of some generics did happen only on some registered dosage forms and for those the sale was dramatically reduced, or zero. The pharmaceutical companies have shifted the sale to the same generics but for different dosage forms, which at the end of the day creates similar profit ratio but it changes the composition of the portfolio offer for the drugs. The decrease of the prices has pushed down the level of sales of the drugs, which is a negative correlation and a clear signal that the supply side is negatively reacting to the price reduction.

In this heterogenic group of medicines there are different therapeutic proteins like insulin, filgrastim, growth hormone, erythropoietin, interferons and monoclonal antibodies. Often viewed as miracle drugs they offer hope, transforms patient\u2019s lives and provide cures and treatments for many severe diseases including diabetes, blood conditions, neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders and cancer.  All that hope and promise that this treatments are offering comes with very high price that accounts for most of the biologicals. Data for global sales from 2014 are showing that approximately 80 billons US dollars are spend for this medicines. The predictions are that by 2017 global biological pharmaceutical market will amounts to about 220 billion dollars (Dolinar and Reilly, 2013). This trend of biological spending and growth is putting big financial pressure on the health care budget. The high price of this drugs and the financial crisis that has required healthcare systems to make significant cost reductions and in the same time patent expirations on many of the biological blockbusters were the main factors that drive the interest towards biosimilar medical products (biosimilars). Biosimilars are relatively new but growing segment, offering less costly alternative and enhanced competition to existing biological market. There is a strong interest by healthcare stakeholders in measuring the biosimilar utilization and impact on the market entry. Regulatory issues, manufacturing, safety, pricing, and physician and patient acceptance have a big influence in the developing the biosimilar market. By definition biosimilars are biological medicine similar toor a version of another biological medicine that has already been authorized, with similar active substance and which can prove their similarity towards quality, safety and efficacy (European Medicines Agency, 2014). Biosimilars began to enter European Union (EU) markets in 2007 and increase competition among producers of biologicals. However, the generic approach of substitution is not applied in the case of biosimilars due to their specificity (Weise et al., 2014). In the last years biosimilars have e significant clinical, regulatory and economic impacts in the medical market. At this moment there are 20 biosimilars with marketing authorization in EU, in seven classes as following: 7 Filgrastims, 5 Epoetins, 2 Folitropin alpha, 2 monoclonal antibodies, 1 insulin, 1 somatropin and 1 etanercept. When it comes to the market uptake of biosimilars, in the Consensus paper from EU Comission from 2013 (Consensus Information Paper, 2013) it was clearly stated that the most important conditions for market uptake of biosimilar medicines are driven by factors in the commercial market place. Differences across EU member states in national healthcare systems, have big impact on the biosimilars uptake. Factors influencing the market uptake of biosimilars are local pricing and reimbursement regulation, procurement policies and terms, physician perception of biosimilar medicine and patient acceptance of biosimilar medicines. There are differences in uptake by country, reflecting variations in local healthcare systems. Biosimilar penetration of the accessible market is only relevant when there is significant price difference between the originator and biosimilar, and where treatment options are limited to the molecule for which biosimilars are available. If the therapy area also has products that have been launched more recently, are still patent protected S1 OP 1342Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 41 - 42 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsand which bring differential clinical benefit to patients or segments of patients who do not respond to other therapies, then payers and health systems should more usefully understand the role of biosimilars in the context of the total class of therapeutic options. There are important factors driving biosimilar market performance which play out differently across therapy areas and countries. These approaches in turn are often influenced by budgetary or financing measures imposed on healthcare payers and those with responsibility for managing the drug expenditure budget (Ruiz et al., 2013). Patients can also influence the shape of biologic markets and the uptake of biosimilars through their advocacy voice, typically through patient groups that represent the interests of those suffering from certain diseases. Current differences in the use of biosimilars and competition dynamics across European markets are not just explained by epidemiology and disease factors, but instead reflect local adoption of treatment practices and guidelines influenced by funding decisions and payer actions. These decisions are often made with a narrow focus on medicine costs rather than a broader view that considers the full cost of administering the medicine to patients. Relevant measures and use of real world evidence are needed to bring policy-makers the level of transparency and visibility they need to assess options, make decisions and monitor the results (Wang and Chow, 2012). With respect to the use of biosimilars, these measures may include the appropriate expansion of access to patients who will benefit from biologics, the evolution of medicine cost, as well as the evolution of overall patient treatment cost and health outcomes.ReferencesConsensus Information Paper, 2013.

Community pharmacist must be sure that the patient has received and understood in a proper manner all the information provided, in order to safely and effectively use the medicines and improve the treatment out-come.In addition to dispensing medicines, patient counsel-ing presents one of the most important services rendered by community pharmacists (Puspitasari et al., 2009). The coun-seling process includes time, empathy and understanding, an individual approach and open communication with pa-tient (Puspitasari et al., 2009). By talking with the patients, pharmacists can identify the majority, as well as, solve minor health problems, ed-ucate patients on self\u2013medication, proper use of medicines and medical devices and where necessary direct the patient to the doctor.The objective of this study was to determine in which degree patients/citizens trust in knowledge and expertise of pharmacists subject to their health status, age and education.Materials and methodsFor the needs of this study were used responses to ques-tions from a questionnaire conducted in 26 chosen Farma-nea pharmacies in Belgrade, Republic of Serbia, during the period from January 3rd to February 28th, 2014. The questionnaire was anonymous and consisted of 17 closed type questions. The patients filled out the questionnaires in the pharmacy either alone or in consultation with pharma-cists. At the beginning of the questionnaire the patients were asked to state their health status, age and education level. The questions referred to reasons and frequency of pharma-cy visits and counseling service satisfaction. For the needs of this survey four questions from questionnaire were cho-sen and the influence of health status, age and education lev-el of respondents was analyzed.The chosen questions were to give answers to: (1) Most common reasons patients visit pharmacies, i.e. how many of them state counseling for minor ailments as major reason for visit to the pharmacy; (2) To what degree do the patients first consult the pharmacist when facing a minor health problem and (3) Do they subsequently consult the GP; (4) Which health professional do the patients consult on queries relat-ed to proper use of medicines or medical devices. The ques-tionnaires were processed by statistic program SPSSV19.Results and discussionA total of 3656 fully completed questionnaires were collected. This survey presents and discusses results ob-tained by analyzing of responses to four questions from the questionnaire depending on the health status, age and edu-cation level of respondents. To the question \u201cWhich is the most common reason for your visits to the pharmacy\u201d  21.4% of the patients an-swered that they visited the pharmacy because of health problem, 27.1% in order to obtain prescription medicine from pharmacy and 51.5% came to buy a specific product.Related to health status structure of respondents, the analysis showed that healthy persons (23.4%), persons with minor ailments (24.5%) as well as those who didn`t check their health status (27.6%) were those who visited the pharmacy for reason of health problem in a percentage above the general average.Patients who suffered from serious health problems and severe chronic illnesses in largest number of cases (60.8% S1 OP 1444Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 43 - 44 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsand 69.6%) visited the pharmacy in order to get their pre-scription medicines. Analysis determined that persons who suffered from serious health problems and severe chronic illnesses where in 57% of cases over 65 years of age, hence the most common reason for their visits was as anticipated.In view of patient age structure, oscillations to general average answers were most noticeable with persons young-er than 30 and over 65 years of age. Patients younger than 30 in 26.6% of cases visited the pharmacy for health prob-lem reasons.Patients over 65 stated obtaining of prescription med-icine (59.2%) as the most common reason for visiting the pharmacy which was expected, hence these patients were the majority of those who suffered from serious health prob-lems and severe chronic illnesses.Related to respondent education level there were no significant oscillations in percentage of patients visiting the pharmacy for health problem reason.To the question \u201cWhich health professional do you first consult when facing a minor health problem\u201d, the majority of respondents, 65.3%, stated that they first consult the phar-macist, while 34.7% stated that they first consult their doc-tor/dentist.Healthy persons (74.4%), persons with minor health problems (69.8%) and those who don`t check their health status (81.6%) first consult the pharmacist when facing a minor health problem.Patients younger than 65 in a larger number of cases consulted a pharmacist when having a minor health prob-lem. Patients over 65 years of age were in 67.3% of cases persons who suffered from serious health problems and se-vere chronic illnesses, who because of possible deteriora-tion of health status or comorbidity in 54.2% of cases con-sulted their doctor when facing a minor health problem. Fur-thermore these patients visit their doctors once per month to receive prescriptions for their regular therapy and use this opportunity for physician counseling (Nikolic et al., 2014).The responses to the question \u201cDo you visit your doctor after pharmacist counseling regarding the same health prob-lem\u201d were analyzed on the answers of those who said that they first consult the pharmacist when facing a minor health problem. Results have shown that 81% of them don`t con-sult their doctor related to same health problem.The patient health structure analysis determined that persons who suffered from serious health problems and se-vere chronic illnesses in a lager degree, in relation to aver-age question response, subsequently consulted their doctor. The stated patient group visits their doctor once monthly in order to get their regular monthly therapy prescription and uses these visits for counseling (Nikolic et al., 2014).Patients younger than 45 do not consult the doctor after pharmacist counseling in 85.6% of cases, while in 31.7% of patients over 65 years of age subsequently consult their doc-tor, which was expected bearing in mind their health status.Results analysis to question \u201cWhen you hear in a com-mercial \u201cplease consult your doctor or pharmacist on indi-cations, safety precautions and adverse reactions related to medicine or medical device\u201d, who do you consult\u201d showed that 61.6% of patients consulted the pharmacist, 15.5% the doctor and 22.9% of patients didn`t consult neither the doc-tor nor pharmacist.Responses from persons suffering from serious health problems and severe chronic differed from those of gener-al average, hence they in 22.1% and 24.8% of cases respec-tively consulted their doctor after watching the advertise-ment. An interesting fact is that persons with serious health problems consulted the pharmacist in 64.4% of cases af-ter watching the commercial. The category of patients who don`t check their health status especially stands out. They don`t consult any health professional after watching the commercial in 49.3% of cases.ConclusionThe majority of the respondents recognize the impor-tance of the counseling role of the pharmacist. Healthy persons, persons with minor health problems, persons who don`t check their health status and those younger than 65 years of age visit the pharmacy for counseling on their health issues in over the average number of cases. Persons under 45 years of age don\u2019t consult their GP after consult-ing the pharmacist regarding the same health problem in a high percentage.The majority of patients on indications, safety precau-tions and adverse reactions consult their pharmacist after watching a commercial.This study has shown that the role of pharmacist in primary healthcare is reflected in education on preven-tion, solving of minor ailments and advising on therapy for patients who are younger, those who consider them-selves healthy or are with minor ailments while for patients who are older, with serious or chronic illnesses the primary role of the pharmacist is in therapy dispensing, advising on proper use and monitoring of therapy outcome. This survey has shown that persons who don`t check their health status see the pharmacy as the place of their first choice. ReferencesChandra, A., Malcolm, N., Fetters, M., 2003.

In particular, Internet use has become important to most daily activities, from work and entertainment to education and participation in society. Also, statistics show that \u00be of all European citizens (EU-27) is using Internet, with Central and Nordic countries as the most active and Southern countries comparably less active (Seybert, 2012). Internet communication is preferred due to speed and ease in many services and activities (Komerik, 2005). With younger generations being the most intense users, students present an interesting group for studying Internet use and potential misuse. Social networks, online gambling, shopping, banking, watching TV series/movies, and education resources, are known to be the most popular reasons for using Internet among university students (Miller et al., 2010; Turkish Statistical Institute, 2012; Wang et al., 2011; Y\u0131lmaz, 2012). However, no comparative analysis on Internet use has been done so far on pharmaceutical students, which present a rather homogeneous group, with curricula that are equivalent or similar in most European countries (PHARMINE Consortium, 2011). Knowing some differences between Southern and Northern European countries, a comparitive analysis focusing on both differences and similarities between countries and regions seems worthwhile. The present study aims to describe Internet use by pharmacy undergraduates as well as to establish an initial comparison of this use amongst European countries. Materials and methodsThis study is descriptive using a questionnaire-based survey. Pharmacy Schools from Northern, Central and Southern Europe participated. A total of 748 4th year university students from Estonia, Latvia, the Netherlands, Portugal and Turkey were invited to participate. Notably, included centers were: Ankara, Gazi, Hacettepe Universities; the University of Lisbon; the University of Groningen; the University of Tartu; and Universities of Riga Stradin\u0161 and Latvia. The questionnaire aimed to gather information regarding students\u2019 socio-demographics, health status, and Internet use and potential misuse. The questionnaire was pre-tested in each partner country, assuring that no linguistic issues remained. The participants filled out a paper-based questionnaire in the presence of a local coordinator. Data gathering and structuring was completed for all countries in December 2012. SPSS v15.0 was used for data entry, merging and qualitative and quantitative analysis. Pearson Chi-Square, ANOVA and linear correlations, were applied using the significance level at 0.05.S1 OP 1546Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 45 - 46 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsResults and discussionOut of 748 graduate students, 654 students (87.4%) par-ticipated in the study. The majority of the participants were from Turkey (44.5%) and Portugal (32.6%). In all countries, the majority of the students were females.Students\u2019 Internet use is presented in Table 1. Latvi-an students used Internet at school in a significantly low-er frequency (43.1%) than students from all other countries. For all countries, students used Internet more outside (e.g. at home) than inside the school, except in the Netherlands. Turkish students reported less frequent use of Internet at home than rest students in other countries (p<0.001). The frequency of Internet access via smart or cell phone was less than 19.0% in Latvia, presenting the lowest frequency of all countries investigated here (p<0.001) compared to all other studied countries.The most often reported purposes for using Internet were communication, academic work, social networking, listening to music and watching movies. Dutch students used Internet for social networking and listening to music more frequently than the others and this difference was sta-tistically significant (p=0.016 and p=0.002, respectively). Portuguese students used Internet for both watching mov-ies and shopping less frequently than all the others (p=0.002 and p<0.001, respectively). Internet use for chatting was more popular among the Estonian students than among oth-er pharmacy students (p<0.001).The results of this study provide valuable evidence on how Internet is being used by pharmacy students, recogniz-ing its true potential and actual use in this group in higher education (Garrison and Kanuka, 2004). This study aimed to look at a coherent educational co-hort (i.e. 4th year pharmacy students) between 5 countries: 2 Mediterranean, 1 Central European and 2 Baltic nations. There was a good participation rate (near 90%). The pharmaceutical profession in Europe is predomi-nantly a female occupation (FIP, 2012; Ruiz et al., 2006). And this predominance was also found in all the surveyed countries. Beyond the demographic apparent homogeneity, com-puter and Internet use varied significantly between studied countries, with a lower overall use for the Turkish partic-ipants. This lower use can be explained by relatively low computer penetration rates at home in Turkey among the 5five countries (Turkish Statistical Institute, 2012). Internet use for communication and educational pur-poses was found not to differ from country to country. This suggests a common electronic ground for studying pharma-cy, although information sources may vary. More important-ly, results confirmed the central role of computers and In-ternet for communication and performing academic work. All countries presented high percentages for those activi-ties, which have a clear implication on the development of teaching and learning. Educators should not neglect the pro-gressive, but continuously, swift to online education, while keeping the right balance between media-based/distant and face-to-face teaching (Ruiz et al., 2006). Social networks have emerged as important tools for maintaining and improving social capital (Johnston et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2010). Although statistically significant differences were found in this sample, high use of social net-works was observed in all countries. This issue may take a lot time and interrupt academic working and success. Also social isolation may occur because of intense use of Inter-net social networking. This can lead the teaching staff to re-member their roles and responsibilities: the emergence of an \u201ce-professionalism\u201d concept, the legal and ethical implica-tions of online postings in students\u2019 educational decisions, how online personas may blend into professional life \u2013 all these factors increase educators\u2019 role demands (Cain, 2008). ConclusionAccording to the results, Internet and computer use amongst pharmacy students during their education seems to be equivalent amongst culturally diverse countries.ReferencesCain, J., 2008.

In particular it is not so easy for developing countries which have low health budgets and rationality in managing this budget is of strategic importance. Most countries are interested to enable access to medicines for their population but at the same time they must establish policies that will promote their rational use.In Republic of Macedonia the improvement of rational use of medicines is a part of the Health strategy and the Na-tional strategy for medicines. Considering the above men-tioned findings and being aware that the trend of increas-ing medicines consumption often caused by their irratio-nal use may affect the public health, the last few years the health authorities in the country, including all stakehold-ers and the medical experts, have conducted activities at all levels of health care in order to improve the rational use of medicines and public health as well. These activities were preceded by a situational analysis that detected and located the causes of irrational use of medicines, after which Ac-tion plan at government level (AP, 2014) were approved. These activities included the educational, social and regu-latory dimension of the issue. In this regard, the Agency of medicines and medical devices conducted inspections in community pharmacies throughout the country.ObjectivesThe main purpose of this activity was to check whether the regime of medicines dispensing is in compliance with the legal provisions (LP, 2016) and according to the ap-proved action plan to share educative materials regarding medicines use intended for patients.MethodsIn the first half of 2014 (from January to June) 880 community pharmacies across the country were inspect-ed. Target pharmacotherapeutic groups of medicines to be checked were: antibiotics, anxiolytics, sedatives and anti-depressants. The inspection was repeated in the second half of 2014 and the results evaluated. Results and discussionInspection conducted in the first half of 2014 (from January to June) in 880 pharmacies state wide showed  that a significant amount of the medicines that belong to above mentioned therapeutic groups were being dispensed with-out a prescription. These findings were very worrying. The highest consumption was marked in anxiolytics, more pre-cisely medicines that belong to the group of benzodiaze-pine derivates, followed by sedatives and antidepressants. At the third place were antibiotics (all medicines were for oral use).The medicines that lead regarding antibiotic consump-tion are combination of penicillins\u2019 including beta lacta-mase inhibitors more precisely the combination of amox-icillin and clavulanic acid, followed by cephalosporin of first generation (cephalexin) than amoxicillin and cipro-floxacin.S1 OP 1648Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 47 - 48 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsWhat were the most often causes stated by the pharma-cies for these worrying data?The pressure from the patients who demanded to buy the medicine because:- The elder cannot visit their doctors to take pre-scriptions for medicines that they use continu-ously (for example sedatives and anxiolytics)- People that work, state that they cannot wait to take prescriptions from their doctors, because they know which antibiotic is going to be pre-scribed to them ( most often amoxicillin + cla-vulanic acid or cephalexin )- Relatives and friends insisting to get the med-icine because they have used it before and got betterDuring the checkups that have been conducted in the first half of 2014, for all pharmacies where medicines were dispensed without a prescription, a data-record has been written about the established findings and it was pointed out that every pharmacy should work in compliance with the regulatory demands. Educative brochures regarding rational use of medi-cines in particular of antibiotics, sedatives and anxiolytics were prepared for patients so they can be informed through their community pharmacies. Considering the low level of health literacy in majority of patients, these brochures con-tained very clear and simple messages regarding the risks they take by using medicines without medical advice.During the second half of 2014 Agency of medicines repeated the checkups (from July to December). In most pharmacies it was not recorded at all dispensing of antibi-otics, sedatives and anxiolytics without prescription. The comparative analyzes showed the following results: The dispensing of anxiolytics without prescription in particu-lar dispensing of benzodiazepine derivates was decreased for approximately 93% to 95% for all strengths, dispens-ing sedatives (zolpidem) was decreased for 95% and dis-pensing of antidepressants (amitriptyline) was decreased for 99.5%. Dispensing without prescription of  antibiotics more precisely  combination of penicillin\u2019s  including beta lacatamase inhibitors, (combination of amoxicillin and cla-vulanic acid 875/125 mg) was decreased for 99% , amox-icillin 500 mg - 97.5% while   dispensing cephalosporin\u2019s of first generation (cephalexin 500mg) was decreased for 95% which means that conducted comparative analyzes showed significant improvement in proper dispensing of prescription only  medicines.ConclusionThe role of pharmacists is not only dispensing of med-icines, the pharmacists are health professionals responsi-ble for improving public health by giving appropriate in-formation to their patients, in order to raise their aware-ness on the safety risks of improper and irrational use of medicines, educating them and advising on what is best for their well being. The legal provisions must be respect-ed and they are legally binding. The Agency of medicines is very confident that this kind of checkups in community pharmacies should be a continuous process until achieving full implementation of legal provisions. These regulatory and educational activities related to dispensing and rational use of medicines does not mean that the problem of irratio-nal use of medicines is solved once and for all. But on the other hand, exactly these activities are crucial steps in the path of eradication of bad attitude related to medicines use.References AP (Action plan approved at government level), 2014 (internal document).LP (Legal provisions), 2016. www.malmed.gov.mk  (accessed 21-st of March 2016).Poster presentationsMacedonian pharmaceutical bulletin, 62 (suppl) 49 - 50 (2016)ISSN 1409 - 8695UDC: 615.2:659.2(474.5)Short communicationSources of medicines information used by Lithuanian community pharmacy patientsPaulius Brazauskas1, Jurgita Dauk\u0161ien\u01171*, Romualda Gauryliene2,  Raimondas Rad\u017ei\u016bnas11 Lithuanian University of Health sciences, Academy of Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy,  Department of Drug technology and Social pharmacy, Sukil\u0117li\u0173 13, LT-50009 Kaunas, Lithuania2 Kaunas University of Applied Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pharmacy,  K. Petrausko g.15, LT-44162 Kaunas, Lithuania* jurgita.dauksiene@gmail.comIntroductionAppropriate and objective information how to make right decision by choosing and using the medication is vi-tally important (FIP, 2008). The times when health care professionals were expected to take decisions on treatment or new medication without explanation are gone (Coulter, 1999). Nowadays patients access a variety of human, print and electronic sources. It is very important to get know the sources there they pick the information. Given that some of medicine information sources available for the patients could provide misinformation, it is important that patients and health care professionals discuss the medications ful-ly before making decisions. The primary purpose of patient medicines information is to assist the patient and health professional in achieving safe and effective use of medi-cines. This includes providing information that allows the patient to make an informed decision as to the appropriate selection and use of medicines. Information about medicines and treatment is avail-able from healthcare professionals, mostly doctors and pharmacists. Other medicine information sources where patient seeks for information are Patient Information Leaf-lets (PILs), various media sources, etc. Most patients ac-cess information from sources that are convenient for them without considering if the information they get is enough confident. It is becoming increasingly important to better understand what places patients report as their sources of drug information (Hamrosi et al., 2014). The aim of the study was to determine the use and perceived reliability of different medication information sources among Lithua-nian community pharmacy patients. Materials and methodsThe 385 community pharmacy patients who visit-ed pharmacy to obtain medications or came for consul-tation in pharmacies in different Lithuanian regions were asked to participate in the study. A method of questionnaire was chosen. The questions about reliability and usability of different medication information sources were includ-ed. 60.8% of participants lived in the city (or center of re-gion), 23.6% of participants lived in town and 15.6% lived in village. 73% of respondents were women and 27% were men. The youngest participant in the survey had age of 18 years and the oldest was 84 years. To evaluate results all respondents were categorized in three age groups: 18-40 years old, 41-65 years old and 66-84 years old. The statis-tical analysis was performed using SPSS (Statistical Pack-age for Social Science) 17.0. Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarize the data. T test and chi-square test were used to analyze differences among groups. Results were considered statistically significant when the p value was less than 0.05.Results and discussionAll participants were asked about reliability of med-ical sources that they use and whether these sources are S1 PP 1750Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 49 - 50 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsreliable and confident. Doctor and pharmacist seemed to be most reliable sources among all age groups. Almost all respondents in all age groups (Reliability and usability of both medical information sources were evaluated more than 95% in each age group!) use these sources to receive medical information they require. According to results in the third place little less reliable medical source is phar-macy technician. Mostly it\u2019s being used and looks confi-dent for respondents between 66-84 years old. 88.6% of these respondents reported this source as usable and reli-able compared to 77.5% in 41-65 years and 81.2% in 18-40 years groups. Patient information leaflet takes fourth place however is the first one among all written medical infor-mation sources. Only 50% of respondents in age group be-tween 66 years and 84 years claimed this source as reliable and 25.3% of respondents in same age group reported not using this source of information at all. 84.8% of respon-dents in 18-40 years age group find this source reliable. Books, family and friends, commercials, magazines, tele-vision and internet are less reliable sources to patients.  Al-most half of all respondents answered they use internet as a source, but information is not reliable. Older patients (age group 66-84) do not use this source to search for medical information. Results of our survey shows that patients are tended to trust healthcare professionals and identifies them as their first choice to receive confident medical informa-tion about treatment, taken medications, etc. More than 95% of respondents in all age groups indicate that they use doctors and pharmacists as their sources of medical infor-mation and that these sources are reliable. Both sources give accurate and constructive information targeted to pa-tient, his condition and his needs in medical treatment. Survey revealed that among healthcare professionals pharmacy technicians are to be treated positively due to their interactions with patients. 88.6% of respondents in age group between 66-84 years reported this source as reliable. There are not many studies where importance of their role in consulting patients is investigated however we assume that this specialist plays an important role in providing patient with specific and needed medical information. Patient information leaflets were indicated as reliable sources. More than 80% of respondents in age groups of 18-40 years and 41-65 years reported to use this source.ConclusionCommunity pharmacy patients reported general practitioner and pharmacist as most reliable and mostly usable sources. Patient information leaflet remains in line with other most usable medical information sources and is number one among all written medical information sources. It is necessary to better adopt patient information leaflet to older patients. As reliability of other written medical information sources is uncertain it is necessary to overview and to control this information. ReferencesCoulter, A., 1999. Paternalism or partnership?

Typical anti-psychotics have been used since the 1950s, while atypical drugs are newer drugs approved for use between 1990 and 2000. Atypical antipsychotics have certain superior thera-peutic characteristics compared to typical drugs in terms of efficacy and side effect profile. However, certain clinical trials have failed to prove any superiority in effectiveness. This is because the newer atypical drugs have their own disadvantages, too (Schatzberg et al., 2011).Atypical drugs are much more expensive than the old-er typical drugs. Statistics in Albania have revealed that risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, is among the top ten most expensive drugs (Kola, 2009).Since their approval, there has been an increase of use of atypical antipsychotics as compared to typical antipsy-chotic use (Verdoux et al., 2010). Meanwhile, in Albania there are few reports on antipsychotic use. This study\u2019s ob-jective is to characterize the use of antipsychotics in Al-bania.Materials and methodsData from National Compulsory Health Care Insurance Fund were used for the study. The Compulsory Healthcare Insurance Fund (the Fund) is a government entity which provides healthcare to insured Albanian citizens and keeps records on medications purchased at community pharma-cies by insured citizens (pharmacy claims data). Every citi-zen who pays a monthly health care contribute to the Fund can purchase medications at a lower price. The total cost of a drug is partially reimbursed by the Fund (reimbursement cost) and partially paid by the patient (patient cost/price). Nationwide antipsychotic pharmacy claims data collected from the Fund from 2006 to 2012 were used for the study. In the obtained data, antipsychotics were defined by their ATC (Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical) code. ATC codes for antipsychotics were used to identify antipsychot-ics in the pharmacy claims data. Quantities of antipsychotics were determined as de-clared in the data, i.e., by their dosage forms, such as cap-sules, tablets, flacons, ampoules, etc. The amount of typ-ical, atypical and total antipsychotics was calculated for each year of data. For a more accurate estimation of utilization of anti-psychotics, the number of defined daily doses (DDDs) was estimated for each antipsychotic medication. The defined daily dose is the average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication (World Health Organiza-tion, 2003). DDDs were determined using the maintenance daily doses referred to in the British National Formulary. The number of DDDs per 100 000 inhabitants per day was calculated for each antipsychotic every year using the mil-ligrams of antipsychotics utilized. Reimbursement costs in Albanian Lek (ALL) and the mean costs paid by the patient were also estimated. Data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel and SAS statistical software package, version 9.1.Results and discussionTypical antipsychotics covered by the Compulsory Healthcare Insurance Fund during 2006-2012 were Chor-promazine, Fluphenazine, Haloperidol, Levomeproma-zine. Atypical antipsychotics were Clozapine, Olanzapine, S1 PP 1852Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 51 - 52 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsRisperidone. Lithium is considered as a distinct drug cate-gory in the antipsychotics group.All antipsychotics were available in either one of the oral dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, or oral drops solutions. Fluphenazine and chlorpromazine also existed as solutions for injection of immediate release. Haloperi-dol and fluphenazine were available also as long-acting so-lutions for injection. The purchased antipsychotics totaled 3.36 million in 2006 and increased to 4.78 million in 2012. This is a 42% an increase of total antipsychotic use. Of all antipsychot-ics, the amount of purchased typical antipsychotics de-clined gradually from 1.2 million in 2006 to 1 million dos-age forms in 2012. The amount of atypical antipsychotics increased from 1.7 million in 2006 to 3.7 million in 2012 (more than doubled). Atypical antipsychotics constituted 60% and 78% of the total amount of purchased antipsy-chotics in 2006 and 2012, respectively. Quantity of Lithi-um more than doubled from 362 thousand in 2006 to 729 thousand in 2008. Numbers of DDDs were estimated for each antipsy-chotic. Among typical antipsychotics, haloperidol had the highest number of DDDs /day/ 100 000 inhabitants with 40 DDDs in 2006 and rose to 58.8 DDDs in 2012. Chlor-promazine came second behind haloperidol. Other typical antipsychotics use such as fluphenazine, levomepromazine and thioridazine also decreased during 2006-2012. Lithi-um\u2019s number of DDDs increased from 11.5 to 21.9 during the study period. Among atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine had the greatest increase in use, with a number of DDDs of 18.9 in 2006 and 127 DDDs in 2012. Olanzapine in 2012 had the greatest number of DDDs than any other antipsychotic dur-ing the entire 2006-2012 period. Clozapine was among the drugs with the highest number of DDDs during the study period with 32.3 DDDs in 2006 and 57.2 DDDs in 2012. The number of DDDs for risperidone increased also from 28.7 to 46.9 during 2006 - 2012. Number of DDDs for Lith-ium also doubled during the study period, from 11.5-21.9.Total reimbursement costs for antipsychotics equaled 252 million ALL in 2006 and 293 million in 2012 (lith-ium not included). In 2006, the reimbursement costs in-curred by atypical and typical antipsychotics were 230 mil-lion ALL (91% of total reimbursement costs) and 22 mil-lion ALL, respectively. In 2012, the reimbursement costs incurred by atypical and typical antipsychotics were 234 million ALL (80% of the total reimbursement costs) and 59 million ALL, respectively. The reimbursement costs for Lithium were 2.6 million ALL in 2006, and increased to 7.9 million ALL in 2012, a threefold increase during 2006-2012.For the entire study period, the mean price per typical antipsychotic paid by the patient ranged from 87-105 ALL. This price was on average 5% - 9% of the total typical an-tipsychotic cost. The mean price per atypical antipsychot-ic paid by the patient ranged from 815 \u2013 1385 ALL, which on average constituted 11-26% of the atypical antipsychot-ic total cost during the study period. No distinct trend was noticed for patient costs. ConclusionDuring 2006-2012 there was a 42% increase of total antipsychotic use. While the amount of typical antipsy-chotics declined, the amount of atypical antipsychotics more than doubled from 2006 to 2012. Among typical anti-psychotics, haloperidol had the highest number of DDDs /day/ 100 000 inhabitants, which showed an increase during the study period. Among atypical antipsychotics, olanzap-ine had the greatest increase in use; its number of DDDs during the study period increased seven-fold. Clozapine was among the atypical drugs with the highest number of DDDs. Total reimbursement costs increased from 2006 to 2012. There was an increase in the costs of both typical and atypical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics accounted for the majority of reimbursement costs for antipsychotics. Notable is the increase of 2.7 fold of typical antipsychot-ics reimbursement costs, despite the fact that their use has not changed significantly over the same period. For the en-tire study period, the mean price per atypical antipsychotic paid by the patient was 10 times higher than the mean price of typical antipsychotics.ReferencesFreudenreich, O., Goff, D.C., 2010.

Medication is the most frequent intervention within healthcare systems worldwide. Achieving the best possible outcome of medication for the quality of life of patients should be the primary aim of all health profession-als involved in the medication chain, as well as careers and patients depending on their abilities and capacities. Phar-maceutical care is a quality philosophy and working meth-od for professionals within the medication chain. It is in-dispensable for helping to improve the good and safe use of medicines, thus realizing the full potential of medicines available on the market to achieve the best possible out-come in patients as observed (Cousins et al., 2012).In the years that have passed since we opened our pharmacy in 2007, we managed to establish work policies while dealing with numerous problems. Even from the be-ginning, the patients themselves were in the focus of our work due to the fact that it was our firm belief that being professional and honest with our patients will only bring positive feedback on the long run.In a close collaboration with other professional healthcare personnel, especially the doctors, we created an important bond that has had only positive effects on our patients. Creating trust and a strong belief in our principles was one of the biggest benefits during the first couple of years. Of course, the trust is something we built very care-fully and it is long-lasting, and it has to be maintained irre-spective of everything.  Throughout the years, as we grew, our main ob-jective was focused on the well-being of the patients. We started with patients with diabetes, making them aware of the importance of eating properly and managing the thera-py. We always reminded them how to use and take insulin, or when to take their tablets.We continued with, perhaps, the most struggling patients \u2013 the ones with cancers. We tried to bring some light and positive thinking and, of course, help them with advice on how to improve their immune system and their overall health condition.     The next group of patients with a great need of extra care was the patients with high blood pressure. We are well trained to organize and recognize any drug inter-actions for this group of patients. Informing them which tablets to drink in the morning and which during the day was the first thing we did for them. Emphasizing the im-portance of proper dieting and physical activity was the second thing we did, and instructing them how to proper-ly measure their blood pressure was the third. At the end of the day, all of them were happy and pleased with the infor-mation and the care they got in our pharmacy.Materials and methodsThe study was conducted by observation of the patient\u2019s habits during the months of January to June ev-ery year, starting from 2007 to 2014. As shown in another study (Nikolic et al., 2014) 29.09% of patients visit phar-macy seeking advice for minor health problems and 83.5% of patients come to the pharmacy at least once per month. 65% patients said that in case of minor ailments, they con-sult pharmacist first. Having this in mind, we took in consideration the number of daily visits by our patients and the time need-ed for them to be served and answered any questions. The objective was that one patient shouldn\u2019t wait more than 5 minutes inside the pharmacy.S1 PP 1954Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 53 - 54 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsNext objective was the total revenue for every fiscal year and the differences between consecutive years in rise of the income parallel to the rise of the number of patients.Results and discussionFor the first 6 months, we reached an average of 35-40 visits by patients a day. Every patient was treated with great care and we started the implementation of the \u201cGood Pharmaceutical Practice\u201d from the first to the last patient. Very soon, patients started to recognize and appreciate our hard work and constant care. In the next 3 years we reached an average of 80-90 visits per day, in other words, we dou-bled the frequency of patients visiting and buying different products in our pharmacy. In 2010 we needed more staff, so we hired our fist pharmaceutical technician. We spent two mounts in train-ing with her so that she could reach out to the patients in the same manner we did. Having a third person working was a big relief for us because we could concentrate more on the patients and on the interaction - \u201cpharmacist-pa-tient\u201d. On the long run this brought us more work, mean-ing more patients. The quality of the service was improved, the waiting period was shortened much more and more pa-tients were visiting our pharmacy. We finished 2010 with an increase in total revenue for 11.6% in comparison to 2009. Compared to 2010, our total revenue in 2011 and 2012 increased 12% and 23% respectively.We continued with the same trend in 2013. By reach-ing an average number of 140 visits per day we stayed in line with our goal to become one of the most appreciat-ed and trusted pharmacies in our city. Working in pairs we maintained the waiting time under 4 minutes per patient. In 2014 we averaged 165 visits per day, our goal was to main-tain the core stability of our pharmacy and that has always been the patients.ConclusionNow, in 2016, having gained a lot of experience, we are ready for challenges. In the middle of this year we plan to create support groups. Those groups should be consisted of struggling patients with the same or similar health con-ditions that make their life seem unbearable. The concept of support groups is fairly unknown in our city, or maybe even in our country, so we are hoping to bring again some new light in the difficult life of the high-risk patients. We plan to organize meetings with small groups of patients ev-ery week. They can share within their own experiences and struggles within the group. By sharing important informa-tion they can only help others. This concept, we believe, can have only positive impact in our patients\u2019 lives. We strongly believe that interacting and evolving in some social aspects of people\u2019s lives is the future of the modern pharmacist. The continued education and the con-stant striving for positive changes are our guidelines for the future.To conclude, providing a high-quality care for our pa-tients and constantly improving their quality of life is a work policy that not only generates immensely satisfied patients, but also generates higher income, which is a result of the increasing number of patients seeking the best possi-ble care, which we, as health workers, constantly provide.

Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* jadranka_dab@yahoo.comIntroductionIndustrial property rights, as is the case with other intellectual property rights, are generally defined in terms of exclusive entitlements granted to the holder of such rights. The exclusivity is granted, in most legal systems, upon a registration of the relevant industrial property right in an administrative procedure. By granting industrial property rights, competent authorities of the state offer certain monopoly which, construed in terms of different legal theories (Dabovic-Anastasovska and Pepeljugoski, 2012), is limited. Legally speaking, the term of the exclusivity granted is limited and, after its expiry, the relevant industrial property right lapses and enters the so called public domain. Such is the case also with patents as industrial property rights. The term of protection is 20 years from the filling of the application for protection (Article 33 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter: the TRIPS)). The Republic of Macedonia is a party to the TRIPS and this requirement is implemented by national legislation (Article 74(1) of the Industrial Property Law (hereinafter: the IPL)).Materials and methodsThe IPL recognizes the granting of patents for inventions of drugs, in terms of Article 27(1) of the TRIPS. When a patent for an invention of a drug is granted, its holder is authorized to undertake certain exclusive entitlements and to claim such exclusivity relating to third parties (Article 28 of the TRIPS and Article 89 of the IPL). On the other hand, said exclusivity is not absolute bearing in mind that applicable law may reserve certain entitlements only until the public interest becomes affected. Therefore, the exclusivity granted is limited by applicable law. In terms of Article 30 of the TRIPS, its Members may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties. When patents for inventions of drugs are concerned, third parties interests are converged in terms of the interest of public health.Article 91(2) of the IPL provides that the exclusive entitlements of the patent holder in terms of the IPL shall not relate to the undertaking activities for research and development of the subject matter of the protected invention, in particular: manufacture, use, offer for sale, export or import of the protected invention, including also the activities for obtaining approval for placing on the market of drugs for human and veterinary medicine or products for protection of plants. This is the case of the so called \u201cBolar clause\u201d, introduced in terms of the TRIPS (Neethu, 2015), which allows for fast introduction of a generic drug after the patent term by permitting technical preparation for registration of the same drug from an alternative source before the patent has expired (Dukes, 2006). Its brooder acceptance came after the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act (35 U.S. Code \u00a7 271(e) (1)) was adopted in the US following the decision in Roche Products v. Bolar Pharmaceutical 733 F.2d 858 (Fed. Cir. 1984) where the court held that Bolar\u2019s acts (obtaining the active ingredient from a foreign manufacturer and beginning studies for filing an application for a generic drug before the Food S1 PP 2056Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 55 - 56 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsand Drug Administration) constitute an infringement of Roche\u2019s patent (and not an exception in terms of an experimental use) which had not lapsed yet (Haracoglou, 2008; Kretzschmar, 2014). In the EU, a similar exemption from a patent infringement exists in terms of Article 10(6) of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, as amended in 2004 (Barnden, 2008; De Stasio and McClay, 2004), although its scope is under dispute (Cohen and Peirson, 2013).Results and discussionThe public health argument considers the \u201cBolar clause\u201d in terms of the right of access to drugs (Van Puymbroeck, 2010). One should, on the other hand, bear in mind the scope of the \u201cBolar clause\u201d and its scope and possible limitations are dependent on national law. For example, the Court of Justice of the European Union is yet to reach a decision in case C-661/13 Astellas Pharma Inc. v Polpharma SA Pharmaceutical Works on whether EU law considers the research exemptions also in terms of acts by which a third party for purely commercial reasons offers or supplies to a manufacturer of generic medicinal products a patent-protected active substance which that generic pharmaceutical undertaking has planned to use for conducting studies or trials for a marketing authorization under medicinal product law (Ostrowska and Minde, 2014; Straus, 2014). Also, in a dispute before the WTO it was previously found that one may undertake acts generally reserved for the patent holder in terms of obtaining approval for placing on the market of drugs but one cannot undertake activities of stockpiling patented goods during a certain period before the patent expires (Canada \u2013 Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical Products, WT/DS 114/R, March 17, 2000).ConclusionA \u201cBolar clause\u201d-like exception to patent infringement, as regulated by the IPL, can therefore be deemed as generally consistent with the TRIPS. On the other hand, one may also find that the wording of Article 91(2) of the IPL is broader than EU law, while also taking into account the ambiguities of the latter. The IPL, in those terms, seems to be enacted in the spirit of the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act as it expressly covers the acts of manufacture, offer for sale, export or import. Here one may even dispute the alignment with the TRIPS. Although this may prove to be inadequate when legal rules are concerned, the Macedonian pharmaceutical market will probably not be largely affected by it. Truth be told, the mainstream pharmaceutical sector will function notwithstanding the provisions of the IPL. In any case, intentionally or not, the wording of the \u201cBolar clause\u201d-like exception of the IPL may be treated as an argument for the need of a clarified and more developed EU range rule, as the Republic of Macedonia is a candidate country for membership in the Union.ReferencesAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, 1994.World Trade Organization.Barnden, M., 2008.

Goce Delcev 9b, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* gkoevski@gmail.comIntroductionAs from beginning of 2012 a legal frame for parallel trade (imports) of medicines was introduced in the Repub-lic of Macedonia. Since this regulatory reform raised a lot of practical dilemmas our aim is to clarify some of them. Parallel imports are legitimate goods that are placed into circulation in one market and then imported into a second market without the authorization of the patent holder, but, at the same time, allow existence of competition for a drug which is still under patent protection (Religioni and Czerw, 2012). They are neither generic versions of a brand name drug, nor are pirated copies that form part of the \u201cblack market\u201d (Brougher, 2014). They have the same active in-gredient, in the same amount and the same dosage form as the locally sourced drugs. The driving force for parallel trade is the price differ-ence between the source (exporting) and the destination (importing) country. This kind of arbitrage has been for de-cades legally practiced in the Europe Union (EU) under the common norms of the primary EU law, in particular Euro-pean competition law on free movement of goods (Articles 34, 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Eu-ropean Union - TFEU) and represent instrument for creat-ing competition for any medicine during its patent life (Mi-yase, 2011). Parallel trade in the European pharmaceutical sector is widespread. In its 2009 Final Report following its inqui-ry into the pharmaceuticals sector, the European Commis-sion (EC) noted that the turnover of parallel traders was be-tween EUR 3.5 billion and EUR 5 billion in Europe, that is, between 2% and 3% of the overall market (EC report, 2009). Drugs facing competition from parallel imports are found to have on average 17% to 21% lower prices than they would have had if they had never faced such competi-tion (Granlund and Miyase, 2011). There is a vast body of case law regarding competition law issues in parallel trade of medicines: The Istituto Chemioterapico Italiano S.p.A. and Commercial Solvents Corporation v Commission of the EC; The Bayer AG v Commission of the EC; Glaxo-SmithKline Services Unlimited v Commission of the EC; Syfait and others v GlaxoSmithKline; AstraZeneca v Com-mission of the EC; Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Com-mission of the EC; etc. (Jones and Sufrin, 2008).Parallel imports, nevertheless, might differ from local-ly-sourced drugs in color, taste or shape. Due to the dif-ferences in country-specific labelling requirements or stan-dard package sizes, parallel imports might thus be repack-aged or relabeled. The ECJ has also issued decisions re-lated to this issue: Bristol-Myers Squibb; Upjohn; Mer-ck Case; Boehringer Ingelheim I and II Cases. Two recent cases on the repackaging of pharmaceutical goods by par-allel importers reconsidered the exhaustion of rights prin-ciple in the context of free movement of pharmaceuticals: the Welcome Foundation Ltd v Paranova Pharmazeutika Handels GmbHand Orifarm and Paranova v Merck Sharp and Dohme (Armengod and Baudenbacher, 2009). Parallel imports are inevitably related to the pharmaceutical indus-try which itself is subject to rigorous patent system (Fol-land et al., 2013). Although territorial by nature, patent law is faced with the challenge of protecting and managing patent rights worldwide. Those rights are governed by two main or-ganizations: the World International Patent Organization (WIPO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). One of the agreements that countries must ratify upon joining the WTO is the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intel-lectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Parallel imports are al-lowed under Article 6 of the TRIPS Agreement (Brough-er, 2014). The legality of parallel imports steams from the S1 PP 2158Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 57 - 58 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsterritorial exhaustion of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Regional exhaustion applies in the EU, meaning that IPRs are exhausted upon first sale anywhere in the EU (Gran-lund and Miyase, 2011). On EU level there is continuous struggle between different associations representing inter-ests of various stakeholders.  The European Association of Euro-Pharmaceuti-cal Companies (EAEPC) as professional and representa-tive voice of pharmaceutical parallel distribution in Eu-rope should be mentioned first. Its position is that the de-spite the specifics of the pharmaceutical market, parallel distribution of pharmaceuticals is a legitimate commer-cial practice and consistent with the goals of the EU sin-gle market (EAEPC, 2016). On the other hand, the Euro-pean Alliance for Access to Safe Medicines (EAASM) rep-resents the stance that the main academic and policy ar-guments should not be only driven by the economics of parallel imports, but rather many other issues of equal im-portance should be considered as well (EAASM, 2014). Hence, pharmaceutical companies should be permitted to implement practices responding to parallel trade as long as these measures are not contrary to the EU competition rules (Forrester and Dawes, 2008). For example, parallel imports may cause negative effects such as: drug shortage in the exporting countries; the drug quality may be dam-aged due to the transportation, inappropriate storage or re-packing; disruption of already established producer \u2013 ex-clusive distributor relations on a particular market; cuts in research and development investments and negative ef-fects in launching new medicines (Monti, 2007; Religio-ni and Czerw, 2012); consumers might consider parallel imports to be imperfect substitutes for the locally-sourced drugs, increased risks relating to the entry of counterfeit medicines into the legitimate supply chain, etc. (Hawkins, 2011). Thus, practices for gaining exclusivity extensions by pharmaceutical companies should be justified. Those practices are: non-patent exclusivities, combining two or more successful drugs into one tablet and marketing it as a new product, continuation application practice, strategic patenting, etc. (Brougher, 2014; Gupta et al., 2010). The case of the Republic of MacedoniaAs mentioned before the concept of parallel imports in Macedonia was introduced in 2012 by amending the 2007 Law on Drugs and Medical Devices. The parallel trade is not defined by the 2010 Law on Protection of Competi-tion. However, Macedonian competition legislation is ful-ly in line with the EU one, meaning that EU practices are fully effective in national context. Macedonia is member of WTO since April 2003. Up to December 2015, 186 ap-provals have been issued for parallel imports by the Drug Agency in Macedonia. Turkey emerges as an exclusive ex-porting country in all imports. Four drug wholesalers are engaged in parallel imports (MALMED, 2016).  However, there is still no significant official evaluation as regards the economic effects of these imports on the Macedonian phar-maceutical market.ReferencesArmengod, H. and Baudenbacher, L.M., 2009.

Quality of life (QoL) has become a part of the evaluation criteria for can-cer therapy besides the classical biomedical criteria. It is the most frequently used outcome measures in oncology research (Lee et al., 2000). In Kosovo there is very little in-formation available about the QoL of cancer patients.The European Organization for Research and Treat-ment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a questionnaire to assess the quality of life in cancer patients. The QLQ-C30 questionnaire has been used worldwide (Aaronson et al., 1993). The Albanian QLQ-C30 version has been translated by EORTC, and to our knowledge this is the first evaluation of the question-naire. Materials and methodsA random sample of 62 breast cancer women patients, who were attending the Institute of Oncology of the UCCK were included in the study. The study period was between the end of February 2014 until the middle of May, 2014. The study was approved by ethics committee from Univer-sity Clinical Centre of Kosovo (UCCK). Patients were in-formed about the purpose of the study questionnaire and were voluntarily included in the study and gave the ver-bal informed consent. The personal interview with patients was conducted by the clinician. Obtained results were ana-lyzed with current published literature. Results and discussion62 women with breast cancer were interviewed. The patients\u2019 mean age was 50.0 (SD 10.9), with a range of 32\u201380 years. Most of the patients were married (91.9%) and had completed primary or secondary education (71%), while 16.1 % had completed high school/university. Most of patients had undergone chemotherapy (96.8%) and 82.3% of patients had undergone surgical treatment-mastectomy. The disease stage of patients was as following: 11.3% stage 0-I, 30.6% stage II, 58.1% stage III-IV, while 29% had distant metastasis. Mean scores for the GH/QoL, physical, role, emotion-al, cognitive and social functioning subscales were above 33 suggesting there were no problems regarding their func-tioning. Mean scores of symptom scales were less than 66 for almost all symptom scale and/or items suggesting lack of severe symptomatology among patients with exception for financial difficulties with mean score of 92.47 indicat-ing financial problems for women with breast cancer.  Eight subscales achieved the acceptable standard of S1 PP 2260Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 59 - 60 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsreliability (\u2265 0.70), exception was only the  cognitive scale which was 0.54. The highest score of internal consistency was 0.96 for GH/QoL. The convergent  validity testing showed that all cor-relation coefficients between an item and its own subscale were  \u2265 0.40 with the exception of item 5 (self care) with (\u03c1 = -0.22). In Table 3 are presented Spearman\u2019s correla-tion coefficients between each item and its own subscale. The correlation coefficients ranged from -0.22 to 0.98. Item 7 (hobbies/limited leisure activities) had strongest negative correlation with its corresponding role function-ing subscale, as well as item 25 (memory difficulties) with its corresponding cognitive functioning subscale. Items 29 (physical condition) and 30 (general QoL) had the stron-gest positive correlation with their corresponding GH/QoL as well as item 14 (nausea) with its corresponding nausea and vomiting subscale. The results for item discriminant validity were satisfactory, with exception for item 5 (self care) which showed higher correlation with other subscales (role functioning, social functioning, GH/QoL), vomiting and pain than with its corresponding physical functioning. Generally the QLQ-C30 subscales showed moderate to strong correlation with each other. Exception was a strong relationship between fatigue with GH/QoL (\u03c1 = 0.73), fatigue with physical functioning (\u03c1 = 0.72) and between pain with fatigue (\u03c1 = 0.70). Findings of known group comparisons according to the disease stage generally showed that patients with ad-vanced stages of breast cancer (stages III-IV) had high-er symptomatic scores than those in early stages. Howev-er, none of these differences was statistically significant. In terms of education level, patients with high school/uni-versity reported higher cognitive functioning compared to other subgroups (p = 0.03), other functional scales differ-ences were not statistically significant. Interestingly, pa-tients with secondary school showed better GH/QoL than patients with high school/university (p = 0.009).  ConclusionIn this initial study the EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) in Albanian language for breast cancer women patients was found to be reliable and valid.  Although the sample size was small and in the study were included only women with breast cancer it is still important for its preliminary infor-mation on validity and reliability of the EORTC QLQ-C30 in Albanian language. Studies with larger number of pa-tients, including male patients as well as other groups of cancer patients and test-retest reliability are recommended to assess the results of this initial study.

Polychronakis21City College, University Of Sheffield 3, LeontosSofou Street, 546 26 Thessaloniki, Greece2University of Salford, Salford Business School, Salford, M5 4WT, United Kingdom* margig33@yahoo.comIntroductionThe concept of Pharmaceutical Care (PC), perceived as a responsible pharmacist\u2019s philosophy, aiming to sup-ply the community with quality medicines and reliable ser-vices, (EU, 2012), involves the provision of a complex set of pharmacist\u2019s actions with patients and healthcare pro-fessionals for the improved patient\u2019s health condition (Ed-mundsa and Calnan, 2001).Additional services, competent activities provided by pharmacists, represents the basis of the PC (Puspitasari, 2009), where one of the services is counseling, a cognitive ability of pharmacists to transfer valuable information and establish a rationale relationship with their patients. Coun-seling, combined with other competences produces addi-tional defined services, the Medication Therapy Manage-ment (MTM) and Disease management, approaches that are managing the disease for achieving positive outcomes (McGivney, 2007). The significance of MTM lies in the ability of the pharmacist systematically to achieve the de-sired therapeutic effects, starting from the therapy review, continuing with the patient\u2019s personal record, based on a healthcare management plan (APhA and NACDS Founda-tion, 2008). This is one way how the pharmacists could bring mutual collaboration on a desired level with other healthcare providers, as well. Counseling and MTM en-ables the determination of the therapy regimes (Al Rah-bi, 2013), and playing inevitable role in the health system. Particular important for the health system is the creation of an individualized management programs for elderly pa-tients with chronic diseases, where community pharma-cists are considered one of the best healthcare providers, especially for elderly patients with chronic diseases (Nash, 2001).Research studies have found that in patients, receiving the additional services for their health improvement gen-erates satisfaction with the received attention (Tinelli, et al., 2007). One particular example of successful implemen-tation of additional services is United Kingdom (Paudy-al, et al., 2011), where pharmacists deliver The New Med-icine Service, Medicine use review and Appliance Use Re-views (Wells et al., 2013), with whom pharmacists treat minor ailments with non-prescription medicines, provide information, guidance and education on patients for self-medication (Anderson, 2000).The significance of the PC is practically shown through the generated savings of 600 million dollars for the compliance and additional 700 mil-lion dollars for the improved prescribing (Etemad and Hay, 2003), with only 40 dollars an hour, for what the PC con-cept is remunerated.The aim of this study is to evaluate the current prac-tices of pharmacist in Macedonia, regarding the possibil-ities of future representation of PC through the addition-al services.Materials and methodsQuantitative method was used for the data collec-tion method, using anonymous structured closed ended 33 questions questionnaire, divided in several groups. The sampling population was pharmacists working in pharma-cies in Macedonia. The questionnaire was constructed and distributed through the web site platform Survey Monkey (Palo Alto, CA, United States). The interest in entering the survey occurred in total number of 85 participants, where from 67 completed the survey. Generated data was ana-lyzed using the statistical program SPSS v. 20 (IBM Cor-poration, Armonk, New York, US).The demographic data showed that majority of sur-veyed were females (83.6%), over 90% between 18-45 S1 PP 2362Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 61 - 62 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsyears old, with 80% of surveyed with professional expe-rience below 10 years. Majority of participants were from Skopje and South West Macedonia, 53.7% and 34.3% re-spectively.Results and discussionThe survey showed that 90% of surveyed are famil-iar with the PC, expressing at the same time the need to re-define their community roles.Regarding the additional ser-vices, 92.5% consider to have the competence to provide additional services, for what they have positive respond to patients request for additional services, equally in pa-tients with acute and chronic diseases, out of which, 85% are asking additional advices. Respectively, 60% of sur-veyed have the practice to follow up their patient\u2019s med-ical condition, thus in a way they are practicing addition-al services, with 40% giving an example of a particular service they provide. Majority of those services are advic-es for improved diet and healthy life style, better therapy management and counselling for possible medicine inter-actions. Mostly, time spend for additional services is be-tween 5-10 minutes, with only 36% of pharmacists devot-ing below 5 minutes and in only 9% of cases, between 11-15 minutes.The collaboration of pharmacist with doctors is at only 30%, but with a mood at 70% of surveyed, that in-teraction to be improved. Almost all surveyed, 98%, have expressed that proper regulation and remuneration by the health system is important for the practical implementation of additional services.According to 55% of the surveyed, all stakeholders can benefit from PC, where pharmacies, could expect high level of loyalty from their patients and improved economic results.ConclusionThe basis of PC, as a contemporary concept lies in the successful introduction of additional services, for what the pharmacist have the knowledge and capabilities to provide them to their patients. The research found, that majority of surveyed pharmacist are well known with the concept and its essence. Practically, for the patient\u2019s interest, they al-ready provide certain services, with which they are helping their patients in therapy management and improved medi-cation results, for what pharmacist are being awarded with high degree of patient\u2019s loyalty, which is essential for the functioning of the pharmacies. On the other hand, for the complete introduction of the PC, there is need for a state\u2019s support, especially in the part of remuneration with which the pharmacies will be stimulated to deliver even more qualitative approach for their patients and made them eco-nomically more stable and independent.ReferencesAl Rahbi, H.A.M., 2013.

Goce Delcev 9b, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia 2Faculty of Law, FON University, Str. Kiro Gligorov b.b., 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* n.zdraveva@pf.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionThe Macedonian Law on Industrial Property (herein-after: LIP) in general terms defines the patent as an indus-trial property right by which inventions are protected (Ar-ticle 3, par. 1, line 2) and does not restrict patenting phar-maceuticals. In the period for which the patent is granted (20 years, with possibility for additional protection period of up to 5 years for pharmaceuticals) the patent holder en-joys the exclusive rights to use the protected invention in production, marketing goods manufactured as per the pro-tected invention and to dispose the patent. These rights in the same time mean that the patent holder enjoys the right to prohibit third parties to use the patent in production or in trade, including production, offering for sale, export, or import and storage of products for those purposes, without license (LIP, Article 89, par. 1 and 2, in line with Article 27 of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter: TRIPS). By principle rule, the license is obtained by agreement between the patent holder and the third party (licensee) and the scope of the rights transferred to the licensee is mutu-ally agreed by the parties (Dabovic - Anastasovska, 2009). Exception to this rule exists in the cases of the compulso-ry license. Materials and methodsA compulsory license is an authorization granted by competent state body, in Macedonia the court, a third par-ty to use the patented invention without the permission of the patent holder (Dabovic-Anastasovska and Pepeljugos-ki, 2012). This research examines the national legal sys-tem of compulsory licensing in reference to the one estab-lished under the TRIPS and how are the main functions of the system enabled. Results and discussion The TRIPS does not limit the grounds for granting compulsory licenses; however it provides that countries can only use those grounds which are allowed by their national legislation. The conditions under which a compulsory license is granted are to be regulated in the national legislation in accordance with the TRIPS (Article 31). This possibility is seen as one of the TRIPS\u2019 flexibilities (Van Zimmeren and Van Overwalle, 2011)Countries, including Macedonia, have specified dif-ferent grounds for issuing compulsory licenses (Article 97 par. 1 and 2) and these include public health reasons. The LIP further details the compulsory license for the needs of public health, specifying in Article 102 par. 1, that the court (that is the curt with jurisdiction for settlement of dis-putes in the field of industrial property, may grant compul-sory patent license i.e. a supplementary protection certifi-cate for the needs of production and sale of pharmaceutical products, where such a product is intended to be exported in the importing countries with problems in public health. The LIP, in this context, defines pharmaceutical product as any product in the pharmaceutical industry, including the medications for human use, which include any substance or mixture of substances designed for treatment or preven-S1 PP 2464Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 63 - 64 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationstion of human diseases including any substance or mixture of substances which may be applied to people in terms of renewal, improvement, or adjustment to their physiologi-cal functions by causing pharmaceutical, immunological, or metabolic effects or by giving the medical diagnosis, including active components and accessories to diagnose outside the alive human body (Article 102, par.3). When deciding upon issuing compulsory license, as per Article 102, par. 2 of LIP, the court is obliged to take into consideration the WTO General Council Decision of 30 August 2003 on the implementation of par. 6 of the Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health of 14 November 2001 (hereinafter: Council Decision and Doha Declaration respectively). The Doha Declaration in par. 6 recognizes that WTO members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement, and instructs the Council for TRIPS to find an expeditious solution to this problem. Following this the General Council made a Decision, noting that, exceptional circumstances exist justifying waivers from the obligations set out in paragraphs (f) and (h) of Article 31 of the TRIPS with respect to pharmaceutical products, establishes the system for granting compulsory licenses for pharmaceuticals. The use of this special compulsory license requires formal notification to the WTO. There are three types of notification: 1. importing member\u2019s one-off general notification of intention to use the Par. 6 System (not required for least-developed country members); 2. importing member\u2019s specific notification of the details of the needed pharmaceutical products and other details required under the Par. 6 System; and 3. exporting member\u2019s notification of grant of a compulsory licence for export and conditions attached to it. The features of the system have been adequately transposed in LIP (Article 103-115). The Council Decision will be replaced by the amendment to the TRIPS i.e. introduction of Article 31bis, when it is accepted by two thirds of the membership (the deadline is set to 31.12.2107; Macedonia accepted it on 16.03.2016).ConclusionAs noted by the General Council Chairperson\u2019s statement inter alia the established system for compulsory license for pharmaceuticals should be used in good faith to protect public health and, without prejudice to par. 6 of the Decision, not be an instrument to pursue industrial or commercial policy objectives.  It is seen that compulsory license may also constitute an important tool to promote competition and increase the affordability of drugs, while ensuring that the patent owner obtains compensation for the use of the invention (Correa, 2000). It is also argued however, that the present system as such creates a series of obstacles preventing effective access to drugs (Gupta, 2010). When assessing the functionality of the system one must take into consideration the opposing views and of the pharmaceutical companies (Reichman, 2009). It is to be noted that, as per available literature none of the SEE countries have granted compulsory licenses for the public health (Me\u0161evi\u0107, 2014).

In-adequate level of adherence is a widespread and everlast-ing problem with possible immense and long-term conse-quences affecting not only patient but also the health care system. For that reason the issue of adherence remains con-siderable challenge for health care professionals in clinical practice. Community pharmacists, being most accessible to the public, are perfectly positioned to help patients un-derstand the value of their medications, the importance of prescribed regimens and to underline the need for adher-ence. A survey research has been conducted with an objec-tive to examine attitudes of pharmacists about professional practice and work with patients in regard to reaching high level of adherence.Materials and methodsThe cross-sectional survey has been conducted in April and May 2014 during courses for pharmacists\u2019 profession-al education organized at the Faculty of Pharmacy, Uni-versity of Belgrade. Validated questionnaire named Scale of general attitudes and beliefs of pharmacists regarding their work with patients was applied. (Joci\u0107 and Krajnovi\u0107, 2014). The questionnaires have been distributed to phar-macists while they were registering for the course and they could submit them at a place specially intended for that purpose all the time while the lectures lasted. Participants completed questionnaires anonymously and all gave their informed consent for taking part in the survey. Statistical analysis has been performed with a software package IBM SPSS Statistics 21. Since it has been determined that distri-butions of all numerical data deviate from the normal ones, statistically significant difference and correlation has been analyzed by adequate non-parametric methods of inferen-tial statistics (Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis ANO-VA test, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation). Threshold of statis-tical significance has been set at the conventional level of p\u22640.050 for all analyses. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Trials of the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Belgrade.Results and discussionA total of 483 questionnaires have been distributed while 447 have been returned. Nevertheless, 14 question-naires have been excluded since they were partially or in-adequately completed, thus the total sample of survey par-ticipants in the research represents 433 pharmacists, the re-sponse rate 89.64%. There were 312 survey participants (72.05%) who were employed in state owned community pharmacies and 121 participants (27.94%) employed in pri-vately owned ones. The average age of survey participants was 34.7\u00b19.8 years. Although there were predominantly females (374 or 86.37%), pharmacists in this research did not significantly differ regarding age (ZU=-1.19; p=.234), nor the work experience in pharmacies (ZU=-.86; p=.390). The total of 83.60% of survey participants deemed that patients were interested to be educated about medi-S1 PP 2566Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 65 - 66 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationscines, medical devices or health products which they uti-lize, while 76.75% of pharmacists claimed that they co-operate with patients in regard to prescribed therapy. One of the pharmacists\u2019 responsibilities and an important part of professional activities in a pharmacy is the provision of information and expert advice to public. In accordance with this, 87.43% of survey participants have stated that they always explain patients how to use certain medicine or medical device when dispensing them in a pharmacy, while 83.60% of them claimed to give information regard-ing health maintenance and improvement on daily basis. Information, valuable pieces of advice and instructions which are given by pharmacists must be relevant, accurate, timely, objective and completely adapted to needs, specif-ic characteristics and state of a particular patient. An ef-fective patient education and counseling process optimizes the chance that patients will make informed decisions, use medications properly, and meet therapeutic goals. In the conducted survey, pharmacists employed in state owned and privately owned pharmacies have not demonstrated significant discrepancies in agreeing with the following statement \u201cPatients understand my instructions as to use of medicines and medical devices\u201d (ZU=-1.37; p=.171). Av-erage survey participant in both groups has answered that he mainly agrees with this claim.The majority of study participants have demonstrated a relatively high degree of agreement with claims from the questionnaire which relate to the importance of the role of pharmacists as members of a team of health profession-als. Actually 94.70% of survey participants agreed with the claim \u201cPatients rely on pharmacists more and more regard-ing the use of medicines\u201d. Statistically higher degree of agreement has been recorded (ZU=-7.91; p<.001) in the group of pharmacists employed in privately owned phar-macies with the claim \u201cInformation which I give to pa-tients are of high significance for the therapy outcomes\u201d in comparison to their colleagues from state owned phar-macies, although it should be stressed that average survey participant in both groups has responded that he complete-ly agrees with this claim. Survey results indicate that pharmacists are aware that successful development of adequate interpersonal relation with patients highly depends on their professional commu-nication skills. Inadequate verbal and/or non-verbal com-munication, confusing messages, insecurity and lack of consistency all have a negative impact on the quality of pharmaceutical care and can significantly endanger the re-alization of the desired degree of adherence. Therefore, it is important for pharmacists to realistically evaluate their communication skills and continuously improve them in the course of professional practice. Although most phar-macists have shown a high degree of agreement with the claim \u201cI think that my behavior during our interaction in-fluences the patient motivation\u201d by Spearman\u2019s rank corre-lation it has been determined that with higher age and lon-ger work experience the degree of agreement with the stat-ed claim decreases (\u03c1=-0.196; p<0.001). During pharmacist-patient interaction some disagree-ments or differences in approaches to solving certain situ-ations or problems are inevitable. Researchers have shown that there is a correlation between professionally negative characteristics of pharmacists (such as aggressiveness, in-sensitiveness, tendency to conflicts) and low level of satis-faction and adherence of the patient (Ranelli, 2000). Sur-vey participants have on average responded that they com-pletely disagree with the claim \u201cI have conflicts with pa-tients on daily basis\u201d. Furthermore, pharmacists employed in state and privately owned pharmacies did not differ when agreeing with the claim \u201cI think that I do not have much understanding for patients\u201d (ZU= -.65; p=.513). Av-erage survey participant in both groups has expressed com-plete disagreement with this claim.ConclusionDue to specific competences and unique position of the most accessible health professionals pharmacists have an especially significant role in adherence optimization. They have a professional and ethical obligation to perform expert review of the overall patients\u2019 therapy, give infor-mation and council, identify potentially existing factors predisposing low adherence level, apply individually tai-lored strategies for adherence enhancement and continu-ally monitor patient cooperation and therapy outcomes. In order to empower them to successfully fulfill all those re-sponsibilities it is necessary to insist on the development of adherence-related competences within the educational and programs of continual professional training, as well as to evolve consciousness about the significance of that aspect of the therapy management. It is necessary to pay special attention to improvement of communication skills and pro-fessional virtues which could contribute to establishment of successful relations with patients based on cooperation, trust and mutual respect.ReferencesJoci\u0107, D., Krajnovi\u0107, D., 2014.

Promotion of youth reproductive health includes all mea-sures, activities and efforts of the health service and the en-tire community to protect, maintain and improve health. Health workers have a special place in preservation of re-productive health. The aim is to highlight the importance of the role of pharmacists and other health workers in the education of young people about the importance of reproductive health. Based on these methods, opportunities for further develop-ment and improvement of health literacy of young people about reproductive health have been analyzed.Materials and methodsFor analysis we used results of survey conducted on 240 students of Pharmacy and Physiotherapy school dur-ing school year of 2013/2014 and also surveys that were about knowledge and opinions of youth on reproductive health from project \u201cHealth education on reproductive health\u201d.Results and discussionYoung people, through teaching, acquire information and knowledge about reproductive health, as well as the awareness of active participation in decisions related to it. School has to achieve educational and behavioral goals on reproductive health, through the contents of the basic, nec-essary and optional subjects. Young people learn to analyze information, and based on them develop critical thinking. The conducted study suggests that most students of first and fourth grade of secondary school of Pharmacy and Physio-therapy have basic knowledge of reproductive health and use of emergency contraception (Vasi\u0107, 2015). The worst results were in matters related to the efficacy and mecha-nism of action of emergency contraception. The synergy of the education and the health systems achieves preserva-tion of reproductive health of youth. The role of the carrier of the activities related to the reproductive health of young people is assigned to counselors within the school health centers. Private health centers should be specially engaged in education of youth. Counseling centers perform medi-cal and educational work with young people. The acquisi-tion of knowledge, attitudes and skills of young people on reproductive health is carried out through group work, un-der special programs. Through multiple levels, in a short period of time and by active learning, training on the top-ics of risk behavior, lifestyles, is carried out. Preventive counseling activities can be conducted through brochures and manuals. Counseling centers for young people pro-vide a sense of security, privacy and confidentiality. Con-fidentiality gives a special sense of security. Health work-ers should communicate with young people and create con-fidence for the open discussion about problems (Rasevi\u0107, 2014). The most appropriate form of transfer and acquisi-tion of knowledge represent a group work and active learn-ing methods through the workshop proceedings. The rec-ommendation of the World Health Organization from 2002 \u201cThe Community is to promote the value of counseling, parents be encouraged to support the youth and adolescents S1 PP 2668Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 67 - 68 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsto be informed and involved in the activities of the institu-tion\u201d.It is alarming that health workers have the least im-pact on young people in the preservation of reproductive health. At a low level, there is a family, which should in-fluence the formation of positive attitudes about sexuality. In the project \u201cHealth education on reproductive health\u201d of 950 second grade students of secondary schools in Vo-jvodina (10 high schools), average age of 16,9 years, the most common source of information about sex life is the media in 675 (71.0%) of students and peers-608 (64.0%) of students. Less common sources of information are par-ents-152 (16.0%) of students, the school-85 (9.0%) of stu-dents and health workers-38 (4.0%) of students (Ukropi-na et al., 2014).When it comes to students of the first and fourth grade of Pharmacy and Physiotherapy School, knowledge about emergency contraception is satisfying, although there is a small percentage of students who had not heard of it. For in-formation about emergency contraception students of first and fourth grade have the least confidence in health profes-sionals (doctors and pharmacists), and maximum in mag-azines and friends. There are differences in the respons-es of first and fourth grades in the awareness of the emer-gency contraception tablets and the source of the informa-tion. 15 first grade students (12.3%) haven\u2019t heard about emergency contraception, while the number of informed students received information from various sources: 35 students (28.8%) from the magazine, 39 students (32.6%) from a friend / relatives, 10 students (8.4%) from phar-macists, 6 students (5.32%) from doctors and 15 students (12.6%) from other sources. The fourth graders showed better informed about emergency contraception. 8 students (6.9%) haven\u2019t heard of it, and the other students had dif-ferent sources of information: 50 students from magazines (41.5%), 41 students (33.8%) from a friend / relative, 9 stu-dents (7.9%) pharmacists, 7 (5.6%) students from doctors, 5 students (4.6%) from other sources (Vasi\u0107, 2015).The results suggest that we should work on overcom-ing prejudice and creating communication between stu-dents and health workers. Students need to be provided with timely and accurate information about emergency contraception, and the best source for this is health work-ers. Health workers are in similar position when it comes to sources of information about sex life in the project \u201cHealth education on reproductive health.\u201d In this sensitive peri-od of maturation young people should be given the correct message, so the responsibility of health workers is high. The results of research conducted in Pharmacies in Bel-grade form May to June of 2014 on 60 people of repro-ductive age (15-49) are similar. A total of 25% of respon-dents have heard of emergency contraception: 21.3% from friends / relatives, 3.3% from doctors and 30 % from other sources (Milosavljevi\u0107 et al., 2014).ConclusionTest results related to reproductive health of young people show the need for further education of young peo-ple in relation to reproductive health, better cooperation between young people and health workers and greater in-volvement of the educational system in preserving the health of young people. Reproductive health of young peo-ple is at risk because of lack of education on contraception and sexuality. It is alarming that health workers have the least impact on young people in the use of emergency con-traception and preservation of reproductive health. Recog-nized attitudes and gaps in knowledge of students about emergency contraception impose an obligation on health-care professionals (doctors and pharmacists) in educating young people about emergency contraception with the aim of preserving and improving reproductive health. Pharma-cists are the most accessible health care professionals in the primary health care level, and their role in the educa-tion process of youth is very important.It is necessary that health centers, pharmacies and ed-ucational institutions in the municipalities organize pub-lic discussions on reproductive health and its preservation. A permanent solution for information, education and pro-motion of reproductive health and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV should be found. It is espe-cially important that the socially disadvantaged and mar-ginalized groups are informed as well. At the macro level, the reproductive health of young people should be part of the policy of the whole society in order to prosperity. Joint action of employees in education, health, local government units and families can preserve the health of young people.ReferencesMilosavljevi\u0107, J., Krajnovi\u0107, D., Bogavac Stanojevi\u0107, N., 2014.

However, the practice of off-label prescribing is very com-mon. It implicates the use of the medication in a manner not listed in the approved prescribing guidelines with re-spect to indications, age-category, dosage regimen or ad-ministration route (Christopher, 1993). EMA, FDA. and other national regulatory authorities, as well as the ALIMS are responsible for ensuring the quality, safety and effec-tiveness of the drug put on the market and its compliance with the approved guidelines. However, such authorities generally do not regulate the application of drug in every-day practice. The doctors are entitled for freedom in pre-scribing drugs. Such prescription-freedom must be in ac-cordance with fundamental postulates of medicine \u2013 doc-tor\u2019s responsibility and care for patient\u2019s wellbeing. The physicians must keep in mind their professional liabilities and responsibilities towards relevant national legislation and obey the medical ethical principles. In line with novel scientific accomplishments, the doctors should prescribe an off-label drug only if this off-label prescription is the safest and most effective therapeutic option for the patient (Beck, Azari, 1998). The aforementioned facts clearly indi-cate that the off-label practice of drug prescribing is legal and very common in many countries worldwide. Based on the outlooks from the available international literature, it is evident that off-label prescribing is legitimate (Killick, Berghe, 2010). The question that inevitably arises is when is the off-label prescribing an appropriate approach? Re-grettably, a universal answer does not exist. The physicians are entitled and responsible to estimate what could be con-sidered the \u201cappropriate\u201d off-label application in each indi-vidual case. Contrary to drug prescribing, which is regulat-ed by somewhat more flexible regulations, promotion of drugs is strictly regulated by national laws. The European regulations governing the marketing of medicines do not offer a universal definition for \u201cappropriate application of the off-label drugs\u201d, yet defining the number of situations where off-label prescription is allowed: products currently undergoing clinical trial, exceptions from EU Directive and, off-label use under the individual decision of a treat-ing physician while applying appropriate procedure to pro-tect patients\u2019 health (Sackett et al., 1996). In the majority of EU member countries, the patient\u2019s right is to obtain infor-mation about available alternative treatments to that pro-posed by a treating physician, that is, available on-label therapies when a doctor suggested an off-label treatment option. Similar to the neighboring countries, the issue of off-label prescription of drugs in Serbia has not been ad-dressed in relevant legislation. Although the off-label pre-scription practice is evident from the data on everyday medical practice, the ALIMS has not yet publicly commu-nicated any official data. Contrary to Great Britain where the registry of off-label drugs applied in pediatrics or neo-natology is available, neither regulations pointing to the off-label drug prescription nor relevant registries of off-la-bel medicines exist in our country. Moreover, promotion and advertising of off-label medication is not regulated, i.e., directly prohibited by any law or subordinate legisla-tion except for the general prohibition on advertising and promotion of drugs other than OTCs. Advertising of a pre-scription drug to professional community is allowed under conditions stipulated in the license, and in accordance with the previously approved summary of drug characteristics. One of the major reasons behind off-label prescribing by the physicians is the unavailability or lack of licensed, ef-fective and safe therapeutic options for particular condi-tions and diseases. Sometimes, off-label prescribing is the ultimate choice of the doctors, particularly after the ap-S1 PP 2770Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 69 - 70 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsproved treatment options have failed. The lack of therapeu-tic alternatives for specific patient populations, often re-sults in off-label drug prescribing to unapproved patient population in spite of potential contraindications stated in the SmPC or PIL). Consequently, off-label prescription is often practiced in pediatric, geriatric and obstetric practice. Another common reason for prescribing medicines outside the limits of their original license is convincing evidence on their effectiveness and safe application in particular sit-uations. Physicians\u2019 decisions on off-label prescribing are often justified by the clinical and scientific facts relying on EBM The EBM concept represents \u201cthe conscientious, ex-plicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients\u201d, that is, \u201cin-tegrating individual clinical expertise with the best avail-able external clinical evidence from systematic research\u201d (Weynantset al., 2010). This very definition of EBM en-courages some physicians in prescribing off-label drugs, provided that such application is appropriate in given cir-cumstances. The doctor should decide about the best avail-able therapeutic option for the patient while providing pa-tient\u2019s consent for its application. Off-label drug prescrip-tion is highly prevalent in medical practice. Most frequent-ly, the drugs are prescribed outside their licensed indica-tions or to different age categories. The studies revealed that off-label prescribing is more common among special-ists than in general practitioners. Psychiatric and malignant diseases are often associated with off-label prescribing, which is not surprising, having in mind, that unknown eti-ology and factors influencing disease progression require highly complex approach to the treatment and selection of an effective therapeutic. Application of drugs outside their original license is evident in obstetrics, psychiatry as well as in the treatment of some infectious diseases. Off-label prescribing is common in pediatrics practice, which is due to the specific age of the patients. The most commonly pre-scribed off-label drug categories include drugs used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases, anticonvulsive drugs, antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiasthmatics. Nu-merous studies conducted in various therapeutic fields, among different age groups and geographic regions indi-cated that the newborns are the population that is most commonly treated with medications that are beyond the li-cense for this particular age group. According to these studies, the percentage of children who received at least one off-label or unregistered drug  range between 36%-92% at pediatric departments, 80%-97% at neonatology department and 11%-37% in primary health care. Off-label prescription is highly prevalent in oncology. According to available data, particular antineoplastics are more fre-quently associated with unlicensed and off-label drug pre-scriptions than with the licensed one. However, the draw-backs of off-label prescription practice should not be ne-glected. Potential problems associated with the off-label drug prescription include the following: adverse reactions associated with off-label drug prescription, increased re-sponsibilities of health care providers in view of patient wellbeing, impossibility of compensating health care ex-penses due to application of off-label drugs, promotion of off-label drugs by the manufacturers. Major drawback of the off-label drug application is an increased probability of adverse effects of the drug. It is attributed to the fact that safety and effectiveness of an off-label drug have not been confirmed. The, implementation of more precise legisla-tion defining appropriate prescription and application of off-label drugs as well as stipulating the responsibilities of all parties participating in such therapeutic approach is highly demanded in our country. Creation and regular up-date of a registry of off-label drugs applied in daily health-care practice is of vital importance.ReferencesBeck, J.M., Azari, E., 1998.

Initial symptoms may include severe pain in the back or stomach area, unexpected weight loss, jaundice, feeling sick, diarrhea, weight loss and loss of appetite, which can severely reduce a patient\u2019s quality of life (QoL). As such, there are rarely more than a few months between diagnosis and death. In this context of limited survival, quality of life assumes great importance and it`s improvement must be the main treatment goal. Gemcitabine is a chemotherapy treatment that is toxic to cancer cells by stopping a part of the cancer cell replicating itself. It has been considered the standard treatment for locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, because it has a wider spectrum of antitumor activity due to its different cellular pharmacology and mechanism of action. Gemcitabine is metabolized intracellularly to two active metabolites, gemcitabine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP). The cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine are exerted through incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA with the assistance of dFdCDP, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis. The aim of this study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of gemcitabine on quality of life in patients through different stages of pancreatic cancer.Materials and methodsFifty pancreatic cancer patients, suffering from local, advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as histologically proven by the Oncological Institute of Kosovo, were recruited in a trial during the period, 2014/2015. They were treated with gemcitabine of 1000 mg/m2 once weekly for seven weeks, followed by one week of rest during the first cycle and subsequently 1000 mg/m2 once weekly for three weeks followed by one week of rest until relapse or intolerable toxicity. The quality of life was measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary cancer (liver, bile duct and pancreas) (FACT-Hep) scale. The FACT-Hep contains specific subscales assessing physical well being (seven questions), social/family well being (seven questions), emotional well being (six questions), functional well being (seven questions), and additional concerns (18 questions) (FACT-Hep, 2007). The collected data were analyzed with STATA Version 11 program. Baseline characteristics were analyzed with t-tests for continuous data and Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 was used for categorical variables. The focus of the analysis was to test whether significant differences existed between the age of patients, components of FACIT, surgery, radiotherapy, stage of cancer, quality of life, and clinical effect of the treatment. A P value of less than 0.05 shows the criterion for statistically significant results.S1 PP 2872Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 71 - 72 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsResults and discussionFrom 50 patients, 26 (52%) were newly diagnosed and 24 (48%) had prior treatment history. Median age is 62 years (range 18\u201379 years), 28 males (56%), 22 females (44%).  A majority, 34 patients (68%) had stage IV dis-ease at diagnosis, 10 patients (20%) had stage III, and 6 patients (12%) had stage I-II at diagnosis. Only 8 patients (16%) underwent surgery, where 3 (6%) of them had whipple`spancreaticoduodenectomy, while 5 (10%) had gas-troenterostomy. None of them went through radiation ther-apy and all of them 50 (100%) were treated with chemo-therapy \u2013gemicitabine. Overall QOL, FACT-Hep, p-val-ue shows significance of correlation between components of FACIT and stage of tumour. Physical well being shows significant p-value (p=0.0000). Social/family well-being shows significant p-value (p=0.003). Emotional well-be-ing shows significant p-value (p=0.0001). Functional well being shows significant p-value (p=0.0000). Addition-al well-being shows significant p-value (p=0.0000). All of these scales were significantly associated with surviv-al, after inspecting the effects of stage at diagnosis. On av-erage, about 50% of patients (25) with pancreatic cancer survived beyond 12 months. About 4% (2 patients) lived 3-6 months, 6% (3 patients) 6-9 months, and 34% (17 pa-tients) had a median of survival from 9-12 months. Two pa-tients (4%) are still alive, which means they have survived over 18 months. Median survival time for the entire co-hort was 10.3 months (range 1\u201324 months), p-value shows significance of correlation between survival rate and stage of tumour, respectively (p=0.0003). The best available evi-dence relating to the use of gemcitabine as a first line ther-apy has been shown to be well tolerated and to have a mild toxicity profile. Pancreatic cancer is the seventh most com-mon cause of cancer death, according to Institute of Oncol-ogy, Kosovo. Three-quarters of deaths are in people over 60 years old. The findings in this study shows that the clin-ical effect of gemcitabine on the QoL of patients with pan-creatic cancer may improve it. This is in accordance with several other studies (Bourgade et al., 2013; Burris et al., 1997; Halm et al., 2000; Kamar et al., 2003; Kuwahara et al., 2012) which shows beneficial effects of gemcitabine on overall QOL and psychological distress.ConclusionThis study demonstrates that gemcitabine can improve quality of life in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. There is evidence of a very small survival possibility and an improvement in QoL. The QoL satisfaction of patients with pancreatic cancer measured by the FACIT-Hep, provides helpful information and they may have significant implications, as well as relief in getting clinical decisions.ReferencesBourgade, S.G., Mollevi, C.B., Desseigne, F., Ychou, M., Bouche, O., 2013.

Patients are direct participants in the spontaneous reporting system in Bulgaria since 2012 (Lebanova et al., 2015). However the rate of ADRs report-ed by patients to the competent authorities is still low. On the background of the significant under-reporting of ADRs through official channels, new medically orientated inter-net forums have given voice to patients who share infor-mation about their therapy, including experiences with ad-verse events (Ginn et al., 2015 and Lardon et al., 2015). As a result some risks, which could be vital, are being dis-cussed online. The effectiveness of several different gonadotro-pin preparations, used for ovarian stimulation of wom-en, undergoing therapy for assisted reproduction technol-ogies (ART) has been widely discussed. Being focused on the comparative effectiveness studies of menotropins and FSH, derived by recombinant technologies, the issue of safety of these preparations is neglected and reduced only to the lack of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) and multiple pregnancies, which are usually set as safety endpoints in clinical trials (Lebanova et al., 2015). How-ever, as far as the safety monitoring of these medicines is concerned, there is still not enough and reliable post mar-keting data for the safety profile of stimulation hormones. ObjectivesTo compare ADRs of recombinant medicines, used in ART, identified in consumer reviews from online forums and the corresponding data, mentioned in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and the data, collected from the Bulgarian Drug Agency reporting system.  Materials and methodsBoth Google, social media and selected medical web-based forums search was conducted using the follow-ing key words in Bulgarian language: Adverse drug reac-tion, side effects, assisted reproduction, in vitro fertiliza-tion (IVF), ovarian stimulation. In addition a search for the INN and the trade names of medicines from the fo-cus group was performed - Corfollitropin, Follitropinalfa, Follitropin beta, Urofollitropin, Menotropin, human meno-pausal gonadotropine.  It was conducted a systematic re-view of the SPCs of the medicines, approved by the BDA, current to the date of the consumers\u2019 web posts. A leading aim of the current research was harvesting the information from user archives and posts to identify both expected (i.e., mentioned in the SPC) and unexpected ADRs. As most of the lexicon, used by forum participants, while sharing their experience with investigated medicines in the collected messages, does not correlate with the me-dicinal terminology, some kind of \u201creference list\u201d was cre-ated for the purpose of this study to refer user content slang to the medical explanation of a clinical condition. S1 PP 2974Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 73 - 74 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe study identified 201 valid reports with resemblance to adverse events, among a sample of 1000 posts collected from 25 specialized forums, posted between November 2013 and May 2015. In comparison, there are no adverse events reported to the BDA for the same period for the studied drugs. Forum discussions, used for extracting the consumer reviews are locked for changes and/or deletion by moderators. The analysis of the user generated content showed that the majority of reviews and comments, which possi-bly could contain adverse event information are connect-ed with the application of recombinant gonadotropins. The most often recombinant preparation, being detected in up-loaded comments is Follitorpin beta (Puregon\u00ae) - 34% of all collected on-line posts, followed by Follitropinalfa (Go-nal F\u00ae) - 25% of all the messages, concerning stimulation hormones and Corifollitropinalfa (Elonva\u00ae), which is less discussed and was found in only 13% of the investigated posts. The rest 28% of the analysed web content, obtained during the study, is connected with on-line discussions con-cerning purified urinary gonadotropins and are not object to the current article. An important fact that should be noticed here is the de-scriptive statistics mentioned above does not claim to re-flect significantly the frequency of ADRs, observed in the real clinical practice. Current dissemination of user-related content can only result in conclusions about the frequency of on-line discussion of the mentioned recombinant stimu-lating hormones, without pointing a tendency of prescrib-ing or valid statements for benefit/risk ratio of these me-dicinal products. What should be considered here are bias-es like prescribing preferences of physicians at the time of the on line discussions, social-economic status of the pa-tients, who are authors of the on-line comments, and the at-titude of treated women to the Internet as source of medi-cal information. The analysis of signals, detected in the user comments showed that social media based signals issued potential un-expected adverse events for all of the investigated recombi-nant medicinal products. Regarding Follitropinalfa, social media users electronically share descriptions of 4 condi-tions that can be possibly associated with and following the administration of the product: weight gain, ovarian pain, frequent urination and emotional instability. None of this possible ADRs has been listed in the section 4.8. \u201cAdverse Drug Reactions\u201d of the SmPCs, where the following pos-sible adverse events are categorized in accordance to their frequency: ovarian cysts, stomach ache and gastrointestinal disorders, ovarian torsion, thromboembolism, mild to se-vere hypersensitivity, reactions, including anaphylactic re-actions and shock. Comparison of the two lists showed that both internet signals and the SmPC provide information for two potential adverse reactions \u2013 headache and the OHSS syndrome. Consumers, who discuss electronically their experience with Follitropin beta cite 7 conditions, they suffered while using the medicine and can be read in the ADR section of the SmPC\u2013 local reactions at the site of injection, OHSS, headache, gastrointestinal disorders, pelvic pain, general-ized hypersensitivity reaction, mood swings. In contrast, user-generated web signals offer 4 unexpected conditions, which can be possible adverse reactions: emotional insta-bility, hot flashes, weight gain, and excessive hair growth. In support of the hypothesis that social media can be a valid source of reliable information about adverse reactions to recombinant gonadotropins, the current study found a significant parity between signals, provided on-line by us-ers and the approved product characteristic. Both sources were found to offer reports for the following conditions, associated with the Corifollitropin administration: head-ache, dizziness, nausea, back pain, OHSS, pelvic pain, pel-vic discomfort, breast tenderness. All the collected user re-views were checked for statements, corresponding with all the rest ADRs, mentioned in the SmPC: hot flushes, abdom-inal distention, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, spontane-ous abortion, ovarian torsion, adnexa uteri pain, premature ovulation, breast pain, fatigue, injection site hematoma, pain at the injection site, irritability, increased level of Ala-nine aminotransferase and Aspartate aminotransferase, pro-cedural pain, but none of them were cited during the on-line discussions. Instead there were signals, detected which con-tribute to the list of conditions, potentially connected with the product by describing palpitation, joint pain and fatigue and sleepiness, which might prove to be unexpected ADRs. ConclusionThe rate of reporting of ADRs by the official pharmacovigilance channels is still extremely low, especially for hormones, used for ovarian stimulation during fertility therapies. At the same time internet forums and chat rooms can be a source of valuable first-hand information for disorders, resulting from application of hormones mentioned above.ReferencesGinn, R., Nikfarjam, A., O.Conner, K, Smith, K., Swetha, J., Upadhaya, T., Gonzalez, G., 2015.

To combat this phenomenon there is a consensus that coordinated action and measures are needed (Huttner et al., 2013, Maddocks, 2013). A simple, feasible way to provide information on antibiotic use on hospital level is conducting Point Prevalence Surveys (PPS). This survey is a part of a worldwide project on antibiotic surveillance called Global PPS, which will enable to make result com-parisons between hospitals in Kosovo and abroad.The aims of this survey were to monitor patterns of an-tibiotic use in the hospital and to identify targets for quality improvement within the aim to optimize antimicrobial pre-scribing for children and adults.Materials and methodsThe survey was implemented in June 2015. The sur-vey included all inpatients (adults, children and neonates admitted on medical, surgical and intensive care units) at 8 o\u2019clock. Detailed data were collected only for patients who were being treated with antibiotic on the day of survey. These data included gender, age, weight (children and neo-nates), antibiotic used (type, dose, dosage, route of admin-istration), type of treatment (empiric, targeted), reason for treatment (community acquired infection CAI, hospital ac-quired infection HAI, surgical or medical prophylaxis), use of treatment protocols, reason in notes. Surgical prophy-laxis was encoded as single dose, 1 day or more than one day prophylactic prescribing. Since the audit of prophylax-is was conducted for previous 24 hours, surgical depart-ments were not audited on Monday. Data were collected from patient\u2019s medical record, including treatment cards, laboratory results and other official medical documents. Daily hospitalizations and outpatients, defined as ambula-tory care patients and emergency admissions on the day of the survey were excluded from the survey. Denominator data included all eligible inpatients on the day of survey. All the data were entered online using Global-PPS web based tool. After that data were validated and analyzed.Results and discussionOn the day of the survey 1468 beds were available, with an occupancy rate of 63.56%. The total number of patients included in the survey was 933: 768 (82.31%) adults, 77 (8.26%) pediatric and 88 (9.43%) neonatal patients. Overall, from the total number of hospitalized patients, 325 (34.8%) patients received at least one antibiotic: adults 32.3%, children 54.5% and neonates 39.8% of respective patients. Top 3 diagnoses for treatment, excluding prophy-lactic treatment, NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) and NMW (Neonatal Medical Ward) patients, were Pneu (25.2%), Bron (15.4%) and TB (13.8%).The majority of patients received parenteral antibiotics (89.2%). 26.3% of patients had multiple antibiotic diagno-sis and 26.7% were identified as multiple antibiotic patients. 95% of patients that received antibiotics were treated S1 PP 3076Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 75 - 76 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsempirically. The most prescribed group of antibiotics in UCCK were other beta-lactam antibiotics with 51.8% (ATC J01D), followed by aminoglycosides 15.1% (ATC J01G) and other antibiotics 14.4% (ATC J01X).Overall 32 different types of antibiotics were pre-scribed; cefazolin was the most prescribed one (21.9%), followed by ceftriaxone (16.0%) and gentamicin (7.8%). Analysis of quality indicators of antibiotic prescribing for adults and children in our survey showed that there were no treatment protocols and no stop/review dates documented. On the other hand, reason in notes was documented in most of antibiotic prescriptions. Community acquired infections (CAI) constituted 85.3% of antibiotic prescriptions, whereas hospital ac-quired infections (HAI), 14.7%. Prophylactic treatment was more pronounced in surgical prophylaxis 74.7%, in comparison with medical prophylaxis 25.3%. Our survey showed that in UCCK duration of prophy-lactic treatment was more than 1 day in all cases.Antibiotic use among children is considerably high-er than 36.7% result from the ARPEC PPS study of 2012 (Verspoten et al., 2016) and results from the Antibiotic Re-sistance and Prescribing in European Children Point Prev-alence Survey (ARPEC-PPS, 2011) conducted in Europe-an (35.4; 95% CI: 33.6-37.2%) and non-European hospi-tals (43.8%; 95%CI: 41.3-46.3%) (Versporten et al., 2013).What stands out from our results is high percentage of antibiotics used for the treatment of tuberculosis (13.8%), which suggests high prevalence of tuberculosis in Koso-vo and it is a concerning fact for our public health system. Parenteral antibiotic administration was significantly greater than European results from (ECDC, 2013; ESAC, 2009) where parenteral prescription for adults and children was 70.6% (country range: 47.8-91.4%). Empiric prescription of antibiotics was unacceptably high. Reasons for this may be various, i.e. Clinical Mi-crobiology Laboratory is a part of Public Health Institute and not within the hospital, and another contributing factor may be the lack of sufficient collaboration between clini-cists and microbiologists. Antibiotic prescription based on susceptibility testing is considered as an important factor in raising the success rate of treatment as well as in shorten-ing the time of hospital stay. In Europe prescribing patterns are characterized by very common use of the combination penicillins, mainly co-amoxiclav (11% of all antimicrobial agents) in 79.2% of 17 European Hospitals (2000 - 2005) (Zarb et al., 2011).Our survey showed that cephalosporin\u2019s were the most used group of antibiotics in UCCK, which is not in line with recommendations of WHO. High level of cefazolin prescription, an older 1st generation cephalosporin, devi-ates from the recommendation on ceftriaxone use from the cephalosporin group. Results show quite high aminoglycoside prescription (15.1%). Actual recommendations on their prescription suggest to be as restrictive as possible and in strict thera-peutic monitoring (Avent et al., 2011).Overall, it is noted that antibiotic prescription patterns in UCCK are in contradiction with approved WHO rec-ommendations, which recommend prescription of narrow spectrum antibiotics, targeted therapy and implementation of restrictive policies (WHO, 2011). Also, of great concern is the fact that medical and sur-gical prophylactic use of antibiotics in UCCK is more than 1 day in all recorded cases, which suggest the need for es-tablishing proper prophylactic protocols. ConclusionAntibiotic prescription in UCCK hospitalized patients deviates from rational prescribing standards. Data from this survey will be an important tool in identifying goals for quality improvement in UCCK and Kosovo and to sup-port preparation of guidelines and protocols for prudent use of antibiotics.ReferencesAvent, M.L., Rogers, B.A., Cheng, A.C., Paterson, D.L., 2011.

Ju-dicious use of antibiotics is essential to slow the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and extend the useful lifetime of effective antibiotics (Goossens, 2009). The importance of surveillance data with regard to an-timicrobial use and resistance at local and national levels and the role of antibiotic stewardship is emphasized by the 2011 European Commission Action Plan against rising threats from antimicrobial resistance (COM, 2011).A simple and feasible way to assess antibiotic con-sumption is using a point prevalence survey (PPS).Kosovo is a part of global efforts to combat irratio-nal antibiotic use and accompanying bacterial resistance through the Global PPS program. As part of this nation-al and global program, we conducted the survey in region-al hospital Prizren.The study aimed to describe antibiotic prescribing practices among hospitalized patients in regional hospital (RH) in Prizren, among adults, children and neonates and to identify targets for improvement of the quality of anti-biotic prescribing. Materials and methodsThe survey was implemented in June 2015. The sur-vey included all inpatients from all wards admitted at 8 o\u2019clock. Detailed data were collected only for patients who were being treated with antibiotic on the day of survey. These data included gender, age, weight (children and ne-onates), antibiotic used (type, dose, dosage, route of ad-ministration), type of treatment (empiric, targeted), reason for treatment (community acquired infection CAI, hospi-tal acquired infection HAI, surgical or medical prophy-laxis), use of treatment protocols, reason in notes. Surgi-cal prophylaxis was encoded as single dose, 1 day or more than one day prophylactic prescribing. Since the audit of prophylaxis was conducted for previous 24 hours, surgical departments were not audited on Monday. Data were col-lected from official patient\u2019s medical record. Daily hospi-talizations and outpatients, defined as ambulatory care pa-tients and emergency admissions on the day of the survey were excluded from the survey. Denominator data includ-ed all eligible inpatients on the day of survey. All the data were entered online using Global-PPS web based tool, af-ter what data were validated and analyzed.Results and discussionTotal number of patients included in the survey was 232. 47% of them received an antibiotic, 200 adults (43% treated with antibiotics), 18 children (83.3% treated with antibiotics) and 14 neonates (57.1% treated with antibiot-ics). Two most frequent diagnoses for treatment with anti-biotics were ENT (ear-nose-throat infections) and TB (tu-berculosis) with 17.7% each. Parenteral antibiotic prescrip-tion was 95.8% in total. Empiric prescribing was domi-nant (91.3%) in comparison to targeted treatment.  Most prescribed groups of antibiotics in RH Prizren were oth-er beta-lactams 57.1% (ATC J01D), followed by amino-glycosides 18.3% (ATC J01G) and penicillins 15.9% (ATC S1 PP 3178Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 77 - 78 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsJ01C). Top 3 AB prescribed were ceftriaxone 42.9%, gen-tamicin 9.3% and ampicillin 8%. Investigation of quality indicators for antibiotic prescribing in adults and children in RH Prizren showed a consistent lack of treatment pro-tocols and documentation of stop/review date of antibiot-ic treatment. Reason for treatment was documented in al-most all cases. Community acquired infections were the main reason for treatment (93.9%); health care infections (6.1%). 71.2% of prophylactic prescribing was for surgical prophylaxis, and 28.8% for medical prophylaxis. In terms of duration of prophylactic treatment, all patients were treated for more than one day. Regional hospital Prizren is a secondary type hospital and one of the largest in Kosovo. Antibiotic use in pediatric (83.3%), neonatal (57.1%) and in adult  (43%) patients is very high, when compared with numbers from ECDC report, according to which 35% of patients received at least one antibiotic (country range 21.4%\u201354.7%) (ECDC, 2013), results from ARPEC PPS from 2012, according to which the mean antibiotic use in European children was 36.7% (Verspoten et. al, 2016) and results from (ARPEC-PPS, 2011) conducted in European (35.4; 95% CI: 33.6-37.2%) and non-European hospitals (43.8%; 95%CI: 41.3-46.3%) (Versporten et al.,2013). An-tibiotic use in children hospitalized in RH Prizren is sig-nificantly higher than in European hospitals, especially in medical wards (83.3% vs. 39.5%, according to ARPEC-PPS 2012). What stands out in RH Prizren is the top place for tuberculosis treatment, alongside ear-nose-throat infec-tions, which is quite concerning. When compared to European hospitals, RH Prizren has a very high percentage of parenteral antibiotic prescription (95.8%). Studies conducted in Europe show that paren-teral prescription in adults and children is 70.6% (country range: 47.8-91.4%)  (ECDC, 2013; ESAC, 2009). Total empiric prescribing was very high resulting from different reasons common in Kosovo\u2019s health system, such as low capacities of clinical microbiology laboratories, lack of collaboration between clinicians and microbiolo-gists, scarce funding of laboratories etc. As prescription based on susceptibility testing is one of the cornerstones of prudent antibiotic use we recommend urgent measures to improve this anomaly.Excessive use of ceftriaxone (42.9%) is an indicator of a irrational antibiotic prescription which needs to be ad-dressed, due to impact on triggering bacterial resistance, particularly for ESBL strains (extended spectrum beta-lac-tamase) (Skrlin et al., 2011). Results show high rate of ami-noglycoside prescribing, which are the second most pre-scribed group with 15.1%. Actual recommendations rec-ommend that prescription of this group of antibiotics be as restrictive as possible and in strict therapeutic monitoring. Narrow spectrum antibiotics (benzylpenicillin, erythromy-cin, azithromycin, clarithromycin), targeted treatment and implementation of restrictive policies on antibiotic pre-scription, recommended by WHO, are not applied in RH Prizren. The lack of treatment protocols and documenta-tion of stop/review date greatly impacts the quality of an-tibiotic prescribing, so we recommend urgent measures to correct these quality indicators.ConclusionAntibiotic prescribing in RH Prizren is not accord-ing to standards. Data gathered from this survey will help to identify targets to improve the quality of antibiotic pre-scription within the hospital. ReferencesECDC, 2013.

Macedonia* dijana.15623@student.ugd.edu.mkIntroductionDiabetes mellitus is a syndrome characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and disorder of the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fat associated with a relative or absolute lack of insulin secretion and insulin action. Diabe-tes is one of the most common endocrine disorders, with a tendency of increased growth. It is a consequence of mod-ern lifestyles and the increasing number of internal, genet-ically conditioned and external etiological triggers. Diabe-tes is not only medical but also economic and social prob-lem (Brunton, 2008).Diabetes mellitus - type 1 is a disease of the young people - children, adolescents and adults. Insulin is part of their daily treatment because without it the outcome is fa-tal (Haycox, 2004; Heise et al., 2004).Diabetes mellitus - type 2 covers 90% of all cases, 90% of insulin therapy, while the rest use the pill therapy. Average daily dose of insulin is about 40 IE (International Units) (Alberti and Zimmet, 1998).The optimal insulin therapy should induce physiolog-ical insulin secretion. Insulin analogues have different ab-sorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination in terms of human insulin. This enables the analogues to get approx-imately closer to the human insulin (Nathan et al., 2009).Insulin  that are required for  patients in the Munici-pality of Stip are  obtained and issued by the hospital phar-macy at PHI Clinical Hospital Stip. Until  2012  year they were obtained  under the Law on public procurement, through tenders organized by the hospital. Since 2012, in-sulins strips to measure blood sugar, insulin needles, pens and kits are obtained through centralized procurement by the Ministry of Health.The purpose of this paper is to realize the changes in the variety and number of consumed units of insulin PHI Clinical Hospital Stip given the type of mostly used insu-lin per producer, strips to measure blood sugar, insulin nee-dles, pens and whales in Stipdiabetes center in the period from 2011 to 2014.Materials and methodsThe research and evaluation of the spent insulin\u2019s is based on the data of the consumption of insulin in the peri-od from 2011 to 2014 received from the Hospital pharma-cy in PHI Clinical Hospital Stip.The data is arranged by type and origin of insulin prep-arations, summed by year and made a comparison of con-sumption and variety. The results are expressed in number of packages.Descriptive method was used in data processing.Results and discussionAccording to data from the Diabetes Centre in Stip, in-sulin\u2019s consumption in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 contin-ues to grow. The hospital has purchased various types of in-sulin, according to the events, and generics manufacturer.Insulin consumption in 2011 was 34932 insulins units from different manufacturers with different types of action, with 16 trade names. Over the coming years, the consump-tion increased. In 2012 was 36932 packages from 16 trade names, in 2013 increased to 41597 packages from 12 trade names, while in 2014 the consumption of  insulin reaches up to 46460 from 11 trade names . The highest consumption in all four years has insulin NovoMix \u201c30\u201d / Flexpen 3 ml / 300, which is a generic Insulin aspart, and belongs to a group of S1 PP 3280Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 79 - 80 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsinsulin\u2019s with average-long acting and it is combined with long-acting insulin\u2019s. It\u2019s consumption in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was 9656, 13573, 18426 and 15950 respectively.Since 2013, there was reduced range of insulins used under the trade name and manufacturer, as a result of the centralized supply of insulin from the Ministry of Health. This measure is taken because of the steady rise in con-sumption of insulin, which is probably due to the increased number of patients with diabetes, early detection and time-ly same passage of patients with insulin dependent diabetes treated with insulin. With centralized procurement there is provided lower range of branded insulin, low prices, total costs and reliability in the supply of sufficient quantities to meet the increased needs.In the research there are processed the spending strips to measure blood sugar, needles and other accessories. In 2012 and 2013, we issued a number of different types of strips to measure blood sugar depending on the type of the glucometar. While in 2014 was issued only one type of strips for measuring blood sugar and it is called Trueressult. In 2012 there are issued 63600 boxes of strips to measure blood sugar, while in 2013 consumption increased by 29% and amounted to 89650. In 2014 there are issued 115620 strips to measure blood sugar levels from Trueressult and that consumption increased by 22%. The highest consump-tion of strips to measure blood sugar levels in 2012 are from Roche Accucheck Nano 1/50 and it was 28250.Consumption needle apparatus for measuring blood sugar in 2011 was 67711. In 2012 the use  of the needles increased by 16.8% and amounted to 81391, in 2013 in-creased by 22.6% and amounted to 105178 needles. In 2014 we have reduced the use of needles by about 10% and it amounts to 94639 needles.The rising use of bands for measuring glucose in the blood and needle apparatus for measuring the sugar is part-ly due to the growing number of diabetics, and it is a part of a program of measures introduced by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia by introducing centralized pro-curement of insulin and stripes for measuring blood sugar.ConclusionConsumption of insulin in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 PHI Clinical Hospital Stip continues to grow. The highest consumption of fast-acting insulin, while the consumption of insulins intermediate - long action in the last two years completely replaced with insulins medium - long-acting combined with long-acting; Since 2013, decreased variety of insulins used un-der the trade name and the manufacturer, which is a re-sult of the centralized supply of insulin from the Minis-try of HealthIncreasing use of strips to measure blood sugar and needle apparatus for measuring glucose on blood level which is partly due to the growing number of diabetics, part of a program of measures introduced by the Govern-ment of the Republic of Macedonia by introducing central-ized procurement of insulin strips to measure blood sugar.By tracking the consumption of insulin improves the basics for quality procurement and reliable supply of qual-ity and reliable insulin.ReferencesAlberti, K.G., Zimmet, P.Z., 1998.

How-ever, despite the growing interest indecreasing the rate of medication errors, a low level of awareness and knowledge has been noticed among health care professionals. There-fore, this paper aims to provide a short review of the con-cept of medication errors, with a special attention given to their definitions, types and causes, as well as to the cur-rent regulatory requirements regarding their reporting and monitoring in the Republic of Serbia.Material and methodsA comprehensive search of available electronic data-bases Medline and Web of Science has been carried out from database inception to December 2014. A following combination of key words has been used: (medication er-rors OR adverse drug events) AND (definitions OR taxon-omy); (medication errors OR adverse drug events) AND (incidence OR frequency OR types OR causes OR classi-fication). Additionally, applicable laws and regulations of the Republic of Serbia related to the issue of errors\u2019 report-ing and monitoring have been examined.Results and discussionPatient safety and medication errors represent a significant part of the quality of health care, as a wider concept. A 1999 landmark report \u201cTo err is human\u201d brought this issue to the forefront for both professional and general public, stating that \u201cAt least 44,000 people, and perhaps as many as 98,000 people, die in hospitals each year as a result of medication error that could have been prevented\u201d (Kohn et al., 1999). In addition to such morbidity and mortality rates, it was estimated that medication errors resulted in considerable health expenditures as well. Various definitions of medication errors have been identified, such as the one from the National Coordinating Council for Medication Errors Reporting and Prevention (NCCMERP), stating that this type of failures represents \u201cany preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer\u201d (NCCMERP, 1998). However, authors have identified heterogeneity of definitions and terminology in this area, which significantly hampers the synthesis of existing scientific knowledge and a comparison of the results. Therefore, it would be necessary to develop an international taxonomy, in order to facilitate errors\u2019 reporting and the synthesis of data obtained. Medication errors may occur at any stage of the medication delivery process, such as prescribing, dispensing and administration. Prescribing errors include prescribing faults, a type of failure which results in an irrational, inappropriate or ineffective prescribing, and prescription errors, as omissions in filling the prescription that results in erroneous specifying one or more data. The S1 PP 3382Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 81 - 82 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationssecond type of potential failures are dispensing errors, which could be defined as any discrepancy between the medication order and delivery made by pharmacists in a hospital or community pharmacy setting. According to the study results, these errors occur at a rate of 51.5 million out of 3 billion prescriptions filled annually in the United States i.e. 4 per day in a pharmacy filling 250 prescriptions daily, respectively (Bootman et al., 2006), whereas the commonest types are dispensing the wrong medicine, strength, form or quantity, as well as improper labeling. Lastly, administration errors include failures made by nurses during administration of medicines to hospitalized patients, as well as errors made by patients during the use of medicines. This is mostly caused by a low level of adherence, health illiteracy, inadequate way of drug storage and accidental medication mix-ups caused by visually/audio similar names and/or packages. Elderly patients are considered to be particularly vulnerable, owing to the polypharmacy, physical disability and cognitive limitations.Various critical system elements that may have an im-pact on medication errors occurrence have been identified, such as incomplete collection and use of demographic and clinical patient data; insufficient health care professionals\u2019 knowledge of medications; poor and ineffective commu-nication among health care providers and the absence of collaborative practice; sound-alike/look-alike medications and/or their improper labeling; inadequate working envi-ronment such as poor lighting, high noise levels, cluttered work space and work overload; inadequate and/or insuffi-cient health professionals\u2019training about interventions for the safety improvement; the lack of adequate education of patients regarding their own health status and treatment; and finally, the lack of supportive strategies for reporting, analysis and reduction of medication errors in health care facilities (Cohen, 2007).Nowadays, the underreporting of medication errors has been recognized as a tremendously significant prob-lem. In the Republic of Serbia, this aspect of risk manage-ment has been regulated by the Rulebook on indicators of quality of health care (Official Gazette of RS, No 49/2010). All health care providers have been obliged to monitor and report defined indicators, including those related to the pa-tient safety, such as the rate of adverse drug reactions re-ported, the number of prescriptions with administrative and professional mistake (prescribing faults and prescrip-tion errors), as well as the rate of dispensing the wrong drug. However, a significant trend of missing data regard-ing the patient safety indicators has been noticed in annual reports on improving the quality of health care, due to in-adequate reporting. Owning to this fact, the same conclu-sion that our health care professionals do not realize the importance of failures\u2019 monitoring and reporting has been drawn for several years, emphasizing the necessity of rais-ing their awareness related to the significance of recording all failures incurred so as to prevent them from happening again. In addition, it is necessary to conduct research on the types and causes of medication errors, which has not yet been undertaken in Serbia. This may allow the proac-tive detection of systemic weaknesses and implementation of appropriate risk-reduction strategies.ConclusionRaising awareness of the issue of medication errors has resulted in an increase in the number of studies on in-cidence, types and causes of prescribing, dispensing and administration errors. However, the identified heterogene-ity of operational definitions disables the synthesis of ex-isting findings in this area. Furthermore, even though risk management phases, including monitoring and recording of medication errors, have been regulated in many coun-tries, experience from Serbia indicates the necessity of fur-ther health care providers\u2019 education regarding these activ-ities, since underreporting still remains one of the most sig-nificant barriers for the prospective risk management and errors prevention.ReferencesBootman, J.

Narokha*, Iryna V. Nizhenkovska, Olena V. Kuznetsova, Olga V. AfanasenkoBogomolets National Medical University, Department of Pharmaceutical, Biological and Toxicological Chemistry,  01004 Kiev, Pushkinska str. 22, Ukraine* v.narokha@ukr.netIntroductionCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the foremost health problem in the world today and hold the lead in mortality causes. This is why the search and development of new effective pharmaceutical substances for the protection of cardiovascular system are among the priority directions of scientific research. A lot of drugs that are used for correction of cardiovascular system disturbances can be in certain manner placed among membrane-stabilizing substances that reduce the accumulation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. Among the most attractive are original complex substances of germanium with organic bio ligands that are characterized by wide spectrum of pharmaceutical activity and low toxicity.AimThe goal of this work was to determine a potential car-dioprotective activity of a new coordinational compound of germanium and nicotinic acid (\u041c\u0406\u0413\u0423-1) that was syn-thesized in laboratory of Department of General Chemis-try and Polymers of Odessa I.I.Mechnikov National Uni-versity under the supervision of professor Seifullina I. I. using a model of experimental chronic heart failure (Kre-syun et al., 2004).Materials and methodsStudies were conducted in adult male Wistar rats (weight: 180-220 g). The animals were maintained (in-cluding euthanasia) pursuant to the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Exper-imental and Other Scientific Purposes (2016/63/EU) The animals were fed a normal, balanced diet and had free ac-cess to water in the animal house (vivarium) of the Bogo-molets National Medical University (Kyiv City, Ukraine). Experimetal chronic heart failure (CHF) was induced by intramuscular injection of doxorubicin (DXR) (manufac-tured by Kyivmedpreparat, OJSC, Ukraine 5 mg/kg once a week for 5 weeks. Investigated compound was admin-istered intraperitoneally daily for 5 weeks. Control group consisted of animals that had solution of nicotinic acid (NA) (niacin, BP, crystal powder (substance), manufac-tured by Aarti Drugs Ltd, India) administered to them in-traperitoneally daily for 5 weeks, 10 mg/kg. Intact ani-mals had physiological solution administered to them in-traperitoneally daily for 5 weeks. After the end of exper-iment the animals were decapitated under light ether an-esthesia, followed by extirpation of a heart for biochemi-cal analysis. Index of antioxidant protection system (APS) of a cell, products of peroxide oxidation of lipids (POL) and oxidative modification of proteins (OMP) of cardio-cytes were measured using spectrophotonometry and fluo-rescent methods (Nizhenkovska,2009. Kolesov et al.,1984, Chevari et al.,1985, Dubinina,1995). Amounts of protein in tissue were measured using Lowry method (Lowry et al., 1951). Results were computed using the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test for distribution-free quantitative sam-pling (n=10) and estimated with p<0,05.Results and discussionDXR belongs to anticell antibiotics and is one of the most used drugs during chemotherapy of cancerous growth. On the other hand it is widely known that DXR is characterized by a several negative side effects, first of all \u2013 big cardiotoxicity (Klaunig et al., 2010).S1 PP 3484Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 83 - 84 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsOxidative stress is caused by an imbalance between excessive ROS formation and decrease in the body\u2019s anti-oxidant defense. ROS play a dual role in a variety of phys-iologically normal and pathological conditions. In physi-ological concentrations, ROS transmit signals of external and internal environment of the body through regulatory metabolic cascades, act as mediators and redox messen-gers in various cellular processes and intracellular signal-ling systems. At the same time, in certain pathological con-ditions, excessive ROS accumulation promotes cell death through induction of oxidative damage to cellular macro-molecules, such as lipids, proteins and DNA. Increased damage from ROS determines the cell fate through induc-tion of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Normal tissues, bal-ancing between synthesis and elimination of ROS, main-tain intracellular redox homeostasis (Olson et al.,1981; Saleem et al., 2014).As opposed to free-radical processes in the body, there is an antioxidant system consisting of a complex network of protective mechanisms for cells, tissues and organs that preserve and maintain body homeostasis. Balance between these two opposing components, in a state of physiologi-cal optimum, keeps peroxidation at a certain low level, pre-venting chain oxidative process, and describes the antiox-idant status in the body. One of the ways to prevent oxida-tive stress is antioxidant system activation, the components of which, in small concentrations, can inhibit the excessive free radical generation. In this work animals were observed to have an intense formation of ROS that leads to failure of exchange of lipids and proteins of cardiocytes in experimental animals under the chronic DXR intoxication. Administration of NA and \u041c\u0406\u0413\u0423-1 led to decrease of toxic effect of DXR on heart tissue. It was proven that \u041c\u0406\u0413\u0423-1 complex has more pro-nounced antioxidant properties compared to NA.ConclusionsResults of experiments prove expediency and efficien-cy of \u041c\u0406\u0413\u0423-1, member of a new class of chemical com-pounds \u2013 coordination compound of germanium and nic-otinic acid, in preventing problems that develop during chronic heart failure.ReferencesChevari, C., Csaba, I., Sz\u00e9kely, J., 1985.

Needs for health care are growing, as well as the health departments` costs due to demographic changes, aging of population (number of people older than age of 65), needs for more and more resources because of other health services and polytherapy (use of multiple drugs in the therapy). Also, there are appearances of new diseases, growing number of diseases that require long-term and expensive treatments, arrival of modern medical procedures and expensive drugs with progress of technology. That is the reason why the Bosnia and Herzegovina government and the Ministry of health have decided to conducte reforms in health depart-ment for reduction of the costs and system sustainability.Nowadays, clinical pharmacists have more roles than it was in the past. Pharmacists as health care professionals are expected to be more included in process of prescrip-tion, drug administration as well as tracking of efficiency and safety of therapy, which means an equal role of phar-macists and physicians in order to achieve a better effect in patient treatment. One of the modern roles of pharmacist is conductance of rational pharmacotherapy in developed boundaries and pharmaceutical care, focused on direct relation of phar-macist and the patient, meaning an individual approach to each patient, collecting data about drugs used by the pa-tient from the disease history \u2013 therapy list, as well as by patinet direct contact. Individual approach to patient is foundation of rational pharmacotherapy for achieving optimal therapy effect with minimal side effects (Ba\u010di\u0107 Vrca at al., 2000). Patients` individual and constant medical status tracking (ex. drug concentration in body fluids) (Crnkovi\u0107 and Ba\u010di\u0107 Vrca, 2013), enable determination of eventual interactions and side effects. However, the certain role of hospital pharma-cists has not been  into the  practice as much as it should be in Bosnia and Herzegovina hospitals and clinics. The purpose of this paper is to show the importance of clinical pharmacist in health care system, including phar-macoeconomic aspects, patient safety and to establish the role of clinical pharmacist in hospital pharmacy in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Materials and methodsType of this research is of retrospective and descrip-tive character. Official reports from Psychiatric hospital of Canton Sarajevo for period of three years (2013, 2014 and 2015), that contain all relevant data about drug consump-tion and financial reports were used. Those reports were analyzed and obtained results were compared.S1 PP 3586Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 85 - 86 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsResults and discussionDrugs in hospital pharmacy of Psychiatric hospital of Canton Sarajevo that have been dispensed from this de-partment to other department in hospital is based on their needs.Since 2015 we\u2019ve have new procedures that leads to rationalizing pharmacotherapy. We have noted less drug consumption per patient, thus resulting with lower drug cost.Pharmacoeconomy analysis, as it was previously men-tioned was done for period of three years (2013, 2014 and 2015) and it showed significant reduction in drug usage. Namely, analysis has shown that in 2013 in Psychiatric hospital in Canton of Sarajevo 91.285 BAM (Bosnia-Her-zegovina Convertible Mark) were spent, or it was 41% of the budget. The same analysis for 2014 showed that 80.337 BAM were spent or 37% of the budget, while in 2015 in Psychiatric hospital in Canton of Sarajevo 48.880 BAM were spent or 22% of the budget for analyzed period.Comparison of traditional system of drug distribu-tion with new established system distribution per patient where pharmacist can control the dosage, interval of dos-age, clinically significant interaction of drugs etc., resulted with significantly lower usage of drugs expressed in daily defined doses (DDD)/100 thus indicating enhanced quali-ty in drug distribution with new established system. Clini-cal pharmacists helped to reduce polytherapy, medical mis-takes and gives recommendations based on guidelines for engaging on untreated conditions or stoppage of unneeded therapy. The most common mistakes that might happen are drug administration in wrong time, missing out drug dos-age and wrong dosage. Official Gazette of Sarajevo Canton in 2015 men-tioned for the first time Decision on the positive, the hos-pital and in-house compounded list of medicines in Sara-jevo Canton, that contained drug distribution in hospital pharmacy and modern role of clinical pharmacist, which means that even cantonal government had accepted the im-portance of clinical pharmacist in rationalization of phar-macotherapy and reducing the costs for drugs (Official Ga-zette of Sarajevo Canton 39/2015).ConclusionClinical pharmacists as health care professionals have very important role in system of health care, with their knowledge and skills, thus improving the quality of health care by rationalization of pharmacotherapy leading to reduction of polypragmasy, reduced costs and improved quality of patient\u2019s time in hospital.As it can be seen from the results, new procedures im-plemented in 2015, have brought positive results in re-ducing costs for drugs in our hospital pharmacy for near-ly 50%, thus pointing to the importance of clinical phar-macists. We should pay attention that in current sitiation clin-ical/hospital pharmacist in Bosnia and Herzegovina does not have the role that they should really have in order to work with physician and other health care professionals as a multidisciplinary team. So, the hospital management and Ministry of health should strengthen the importance of role of clinical pharmacist in hospital usage of drugs as well as that head of department of hospital pharmacy should be pharmacist who held specialist degree in clinical/hospital pharmacy.

In primary care, community pharmacists are well accessi-ble health care providers who could easily support health promotion initiatives at the individual, community and so-cietal levels. A number of studies in UK, Australia and oth-er countries give evidence that pharmacist interventions are willingly accepted by patients. Tobacco smoking is the main risk factor for several leading causes in death includ-ing cancer and heart disease and also the leading cause of early death. Today, community pharmacies provide dif-ferent extended services connected to health promotion and smoking cessation could be listed as one of these ser-vices. It is important to emphasize that counselling about smoking cessation consists of different type of communi-cation: identification of patient\u00b4s willingness to quit smok-ing, evaluation of his/her health condition and providing information about nicotine replacement therapy. Earlier in-ternational research has demonstrated that quality of smok-ing cessation consultation given at community pharmacies could be improved by covering all above listed counsel-ling aspects.Materials and methodsCross-sectional survey among community pharmacists and assistant pharmacists was undertaken in January till June 2015. The participants were recruited using universal sampling from six different districts of Lithuania. Ques-tionnaires were distributed to randomly selected commu-nity pharmacies and collected one week after the first visit. All pharmacists and assistant pharmacists who worked at the selected pharmacies were asked to fill in the question-naire. The questionnaire consisted of 26 closed and open questions about health promotion and smoking cessation at community pharmacy and 12 questions about demograph-ics of the respondents. The statistical analysis was per-formed using Statistical package for Social Science (SPSS v. 17.0). Descriptive statistics were calculated to summa-rize the data. T test and chi-square test were used to ana-lyze differences among groups. Statistical significance was set at the level p<0.05.Results and discussionIn total there were 450 questionnaires distributed and 352 returned as completed (response rate 78.2%). Majority of the respondents (97.2%) agreed that health promotion is very important to patients and half of them (53.4%) considered that community pharmacies could provide this type of services.  Although even 69.3 present S1 PP 3688Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 87 - 88 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsof pharmacy professionals think that smoking cessation information is available for the pharmacy patients in many various resources, but  only 31,9 percent of the respondents think that  patients who want to quit smoking can do it by themselves without any professional consultation and the only condition for stop smoking is a wish.  73.3 percent of all the respondents agrees that  community pharmacy is the place where comes patients with smoking cessation questions, but only 33.3 percent of the respondents strongly agreed with a statement that that \u201cI am a qualified professional who can help people who want to stop smoking\u201d (26.5 percent disagreed with this statement). Most of the pharmacist (85.3 percent) also disagreed with a statement that \u201cIt is nothing wrong to smoke few cigarettes per day\u201d. Respondents have experienced interest towards smoking cessation consultation one to two times per day and mostly it took up to five minutes to communicate with patient. Despite on 79.8% of the respondents reported having professional experience on smoking cessation consultation, a number of barriers connected with pharmacist (professional competence and communication skills); management of pharmacy (payment for extended services, selection of nicotine replacement products, possibility for private consultation, lack of time for communication with patients) and governmental activities (dissemination of information on tobacco use risks and reimbursement of nicotine replacement therapy) were listed. More frequent information sources about smoking cessation for pharmacists were professional journals and books (76.1%), formal education (university/college) and internet (53.6%) and the information provided from industry of nicotine replacement therapies 4 (2.3%), the patient\u2019s motivation (91.1%), pharmacist\u00b4s competence (78.6%) and duration of the consultation were named as the main factors for successful communication. Pharmacists who had longer working experience and previous status of smoking were more keen on providing smoking cessation consultation (p<0.05). Nicotine gum (94.4%) and nicotine patches (86.3%) were indicated to be the most effective medications for ceasing smoking. ConclusionCommunity pharmacists in Lithuania have positive perception towards health promotion activities at community pharmacy. Most of the respondents declared existing professional knowledge for provision of this type of services. Smoking cessation counseling is everyday practice at community pharmacies in Lithuania. Improving pharmacists\u00b4 education in patient counseling and health promotion including smoking cessation would increase quality of extended community pharmacy services in the future.

Kongresii Manastirit, No. 133, 1005 Tirana, Albania* brizidosti@yahoo.comIntroductionIn order to provide medical assistance to children, physicians often have prescribed unauthorized medicinal products due to lack of suitable and authorized medicine for children (Cuzzolinet al., 2006). This attitude seems to lead to an increased rate of adverse drug reactions and medical errors (Auby, 2008). Moreover, tablets have been authorized for children below the age of 6 years, even though they may be not able to swallow tablets (Cohen et al., 2009). It is very important to study at what rate authorized medicines are really adequate for use in children. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the number of medicines and active ingredients for pediatric population that are authorized and marketed in Albania, for five selected groups. The second objective was to evaluate the age-appropriateness of the selected medicines evaluated on two aspects: dose capability and suitability of the pharmaceutical form for use in children.Materials and methodsFrom database of medicines of Albanian National Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices in Albania, till 10 April 2015, was identifies authorized medicines. For this study were selected the following active ingredients: ACE Inhibitors: Captopril, Ramipril, Enalapril; Calcium antagonists: Nifedipine, Verapamil, Amlodipine; \u03b2\u2013 Blockers: Propranolol, Carvedilol, Atenolol. This database doesn\u2019t allow extraction of marketed products and active ingredients classified based on age-appropriateness. For this reason were the evaluated Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). From SmPCs that were used sources information document, were analyzed sections: pharmaceutical form, therapeutic indications, posology, route of administration, suitability of dosages and pharmaceutical forms for use in children. A special focus was dedicated to age-appropriateness of selected products. First investigated aspect was if recommended dose is prescribed to children based on classification of pediatric age: preterm newborn infants, term newborn infants, infants and toddlers, children and adolescents. Second investigated aspect was if approved pharmaceutical form, for selected products in this study, were suitable for use in children. For solid forms (such as tablets and capsules) were evaluated presence of score line and possibility of opening or not of contain of capsules and mixing of it with liquid.Based on all prescribed methodology use for this study were collected these data: authorized indications; authorized age-group; pharmaceutical form; authorized dosage; presence of score line in tablets or film coated tablets; information on possibility for opening capsules contains.Results and discussionIn total was studies 118 authorized medicinal products in Albania; 5 products containing Captopril, 18 products containing Ramipril, 17 products containing Enalapril, 17 products containing Nifedipine, 9 products containing Verapamil, 19 products containing Amlodipine, 1 product containing Propranolol, 24 products containing Carvedilol and 8 products containing Atenolol. Evaluation of the SmPCs of products suggesting that only 3 active substances are authorized for use in children. Furthermore, all these products were for solid oral intake forms and all were tablets (n = 118, 100 %). Investigation of the SmPCs for age-appropriateness of these products S1 PP 3790Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 89 - 90 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsbased on recommended dose and suitability of forms for use in children showed that all products are authorized in following pharmaceutical forms: 78.5 % tablets, 7.4 % coated tablets, 12.4 % modified-release film-coated tablets and 1.7 % film coated tablets. For any active ingredient weren\u2019t found authorized liquid formulations, which are more appropriate for use in children. Evaluation of authorized solid (tablets, film coated tablets, capsules) pharmaceuticals forms for the presence score line, in other to archives smaller dosages shows these results: 40.7 % of medicinal products were without score line (n = 48), 53.4 % have score line in one side of the tab-let (n = 63), 3.4 % have score line in both sides (n = 4) and for 2.5 % (n = 3) information wasn\u2019t available in checked SmPCs.ConclusionThis study shows lack of availability of pediatric medicines for selected products and shows that pediatric medicines may not be age-appropriate. Therefore, are needed more efforts to increase the number of drugs authorized for the pediatric groups. The development of medicines for use in children require that a specific active ingredient need to be available in different dosage forms and strengths. The dose capability was considered an important criteria. A medicine is either dose capable or it is not. However, the suitability of pharmaceutical forms is not as absolute. According to EU reflection paper tablets and capsules are only suitable from the age of 6 years. However, recent studies have shown that small tablets can be swallowed by young children. Also, some capsules can be opened and their content can be mixed with liquids, such as water. This make possible easy intake comparing with other solid forms.Healthcare personnel\u2019s should consider that by using formulation not appropriate for children may cause administration errors, lack of therapeutic compliance and unexpected side effects. In order to reduce the risk of any of below problems, they are encouraged to search between marketed products the most appropriate medicine for treating groups of pediatric population.ReferencesAuby, P., 2008.

The studies indicate that current factors affecting public pharmacy are not condu-cive to independent pharmacies development. Global trend is that that the traditional model of a pharmacist owning his/her own pharmacy is replaced by chains of communi-ty pharmacies .With increasing corporate ownership, there is concern that this trend will adversely affect the profes-sion\u2019s ability to influence pharmacy practice and practice change. \u201cDual loyalty\u201d of pharmacists (to the employ-er and to the patient) is present in all sectors of pharma-cy practice. The professional autonomy is defined as \u201cthe right and privilege granted by a governmental authority to a class of professionals, and to each licensed individ-ual within that profession, to exercise independent, expert judgment within a legally defined scope of practice, to pro-vide services in the best interests of the client. It is very im-portant to pharmacy practice because of the change in the profession vision: the movement from a mainly medication compounding and supply to a patient-care function is ob-served. A code of Ethics for Pharmacists regulates the pri-ority of patient need and wellbeing, but corporate owner-ship can force the pharmacist to the enhancement of supply side\u201d (FIP, 2014). The risks associated with the decrease of health professional autonomy are poorly perceived by con-sumers, policy makers, health insurance executives, hos-pital and health care administrators, and many health-care practitioners. The aim of the study is to determine the char-acteristics of non-chain community pharmacies and to ana-lyze their owners\u2019 attitude towards professional autonomy.Materials and methodsThe research was conducted from January to Decem-ber, 2015. The research projects was divided into 2 stages. In first part the independent non - chain pharmacies were identified and classified, and then only the owners of inde-pendent pharmacies who owned 4 or less pharmacies were asked to participate in the survey, using structured ques-tionnaire. Questionnaire included the questions about at-titudes towards professional autonomy and characteristics of their pharmacies. The evaluation of professional auton-omy consisted of two parts: pharmacist\u2019 professional au-tonomy benefits (1) for society and (2) for the profession of pharmacy. In total there were 121 questionnaires distrib-uted, out of which 102 were returned fully completed (re-sponse rate 84.3%). The statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) 17.0. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies, means and rang-es were calculated to summarize the data. T test and chi-square were used to analyze the differences among groups. Results were considered significant when the p value was less than 0.05.S1 PP 3892Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 91 - 92 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsResults and discussion81.4% of the respondents were women and 91. % of respondents had a Master\u2019s degree in Pharmacy. In most cases, respondents indicated that they manage one pharma-cy (71.6%). Over half of respondents (56.86%) do not offer additional services in their pharmacies (i.e. blood pressure measurement, the determination of glucose concentration in the blood, etc.). Evaluating their pharmacies respon-dents provided the following answers \u2013 nearby treatment facility (55.89 %), is not far away from a direct competitor (58.82%), is not nearby intensive flow of people (85.29 %), is not a niche pharmacy (77.45%). Individual non-chain pharmacies owners claim highly qualified professionals work in their pharmacies (100%). Respondents strong-ly agreed and agreed that pharmacists, whose profession-al autonomy is unrestricted, (1) can meet the patients ex-pectations better (94.12%), can apply professional knowl-edge more competently (90.20%), can collaborate with other health care professionals more actively (87.25%), contribute to better health care system (92.16%) and (2) have greater public confidence (68.63%), avoid a conflict of interest when they recommend a product to patients (82.35%), ensure pharmacist profession cultural improve-ment and maintenance of professional honor (92.16%). According to respondents, the main benefits of indepen-dent pharmacy are motivated staff (39.31 %) and patient\u2019s stability (28.32%). The main difficulties in the manage-ment of an independent pharmacy are unequal discounts from wholesale (47.2%) and tax burden (25.6%). 43.14% of respondents hoped that they will be able to keep their pharmacies in the coming 5 years. This study highlights distinct \u2018independent\u2019 expression of professional identity and suggests the need to assess the value of independent community pharmacy as being different from but comple-mentary to the service provided by multiples/large chains.ConclusionThis study showed that all owners of independent community pharmacy work in their pharmacies as pharmacists or administration staff. Pharmacy owners perceive professional autonomy a high level.. They believe that it has great influence to their professional practice, enhance job satisfaction and bring added value to the patients. Despite all difficulties in the management and tough competition with non-chain pharmacies, the majority of independent community pharmacies owners value the professional autonomy and this encourages them to keep business.ReferencesFIP, 2014.

Heart failure is a ma-jor cause of morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of socio-demographic and lifestyle factors in patients diagnosed with heart failure as lifestyle interventions could have substantial power to improve pa-tient\u2019s health. The prevalence of heart failure is expected to increase by 25% by 2030 (Heidenreich et al., 2011). Heart failure is a life-threatening disease and it should be consid-ered a global priority. There is little evidence about heart failure patients in Albania, hence the necessity of carrying out such a study.Materials and methodsWe surveyed 200 patients, who were hospitalized at the department of Internal Medicine in QSUT \u201cN\u00ebn\u00eb Tereza\u201d, Tirana during the period from January 2015 until June 2015. The methodology consisted of the use of both primary and secondary data. This study was mostly prospective, but it had some retrospective elements. We used Chi-squared test to find statistically significant correlations between socio-demographic and lifestyle factors with heart failure. When p<0.05, the correlation was statistically significant, while when p<0.1, the correlation was considered marginally sig-nificant.                                                                                                                                                             Results and discussionIn total, 200 patients were included in this study, 160 of them were diagnosed with heart failure. 117 (58.5%) of them answered the questionnaire during their stay in the hospital, while for the other 83 (41.5 %) patients, we ob-tained their data from their clinical files. From 200 patients included in this study, females represented 52.5% and males represented 47.5%. Meanwhile, among patients di-agnosed with heart failure, females and males represented equally 50%. This ratio is in accordance with other stud-ies in the world, where the prevalence of heart failure in fe-males and males is similar. This can be explained with the fact that females live longer than males, even though males have higher incidence than females (Mehta and Cowie, 2006). The mean age of 200 patients was 66.9, while the mean age of patients diagnosed with heart failure was 70.1. 81% patients lived in the city and 19% lived in the village. From 117 patients that were asked about their level of edu-cation, 31.6% patients answered that they had finished pre-elementary school or less, 23.1% patients had finished ele-mentary school, 35% had finished high school and 10.3% had been graduated. Furthermore, 53.8% of the patients in-terviewed indicated their income as low, 45.3% as average and 0.9% as high. Another question that was asked to patients was if they performed any physical activity; in regards to this ques-tion, 41.9 % answered Yes and 58.1 % answered No. To the question if they kept a healthy diet, 44% answered Yes and 56% answered No. Also, patients were asked if they smoke and the responses were as below:  7.7% were active users, 36% used to smoke in the past, but they no longer did and 56.3% had never smoked. With regards to the use of alco-hol, 72.6% of the patients answered that they never used S1 PP 3994Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 93 - 94 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsit, 23.9% answered that they used it rarely and 3.4% an-swered that they used it frequently. From the Chi-squared test was found a strong corre-lation between age and heart failure (p=0.001). Heart fail-ure becomes more common with increasing age. This re-sult is consistent with  studies in North America and Eu-rope, where few patients with heart failure are 50 years of age or under and more than 80% are 65 years of age or over (Bui et al, 2011) Another strong correlation was also found between physical activity and heart failure (p=0.001). Pa-tients that did physical activity had lower risk to develop heart failure than patients who did not. This correlation has also been found from other studies in the world. Further-more, physical activity is one of the elements where there can be intervention to prevent heart failure (Young et al., 2014)Our study didn\u2019t find any correlation between income level, smoke, place where patients lived and heart failure (p-values, respectively: 0.262, 0.563 and 0.787). On the other hand, there was a correlation between the level of ed-ucation and heart failure (p=0.041). Lastly, the results of this study indicated a marginally significant correlation be-tween healthy diet, alcohol use and heart failure (p-values, respectively: 0.084 and 0.068).  ConclusionBased on our findings, it can be concluded that phys-ical activity and healthy diet should be part of patient\u2019s lives, because they have an important role in preventing heart failure. Health professionals should be the ones to promote a healthy lifestyle, which has a direct impact on the development of heart failure and the disease recidivism.

The amount of waste produced can be seen as an indicator of how efficient we are as a society, particularly in relation to our use of nat-ural resources and waste treatment operations. Historical-ly, waste management systems were introduced to protect public health. In the 1970s and 1980s, waste management systems focused on controlling outlets to air, water and groundwa-ter. In recent years, the focus has been increasingly on uti-lizing waste as a resource. Even though several measures have been introduced to reduce waste quantity, waste vol-umes still increase. Environmental pollution by pharma-ceutical waste can become a hazardous waste if it is not disposed of in accordance with law and if you are irrespon-sible and out of control delayed and thrown in the trash container, poured into drains or buried in the ground. Haz-ardous waste at its origin, composition or concentration of hazardous substances can cause harm to the environment and human health. Considerable concern has been raised regarding potential effects on human health due to pres-ence of pharmaceuticals from environmental to drinking water. Thus, drugs and their degradation products can pol-lute underground waters or enter the food chain. Some studies show that several common drugs were present in the final effluent in concentrations high enough to poten-tially affect ecosystems (UK Water Industry Research, 2014). Expired household drugs often end up in waste-waters or in municipal wastes. In accordance with the EU regulations, throwing away unused drugs has been forbid-den since 1994 (European Union: European Council Di-rective 94/67/EC, 1994). Yet, it was established that a third of all sold drugs in Germany, as well as around 25% of those sold in Austria is disposed of with other household waste or ends up in wastewaters (Greiner and Ronnefarhrt, 2003). A survey showed that 17.7% of respondents dispose of the expired and surplus drugs by flushing them down the toilet. More than half the respondents of the USA-made study threw drugs into wastewater, while only 23% of the respondents had returned drugs to the pharmacist (Bound and Voulvoulis, 2005).Research conducted in other countries has shown that unused drugs are mostly stored in households and that they are most often thrown into municipal waste or spilled into wastewater.  All of the previously mentioned facts are im-portant from the aspects of estimate of ways in which drugs get into the environment. Due to the continuous release of active substances, their bioactive metabolites accumulate in the ground and sediments and have an unfavorable im-pact on natural ecosystem (Tong et al., 2011).In Serbia, particularly in Novi Sad, most of expired drugs citizens have returned to the special containers placed within the pharmacies of Public Pharmacy Institu-tion of Novi Sad, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.At the Public Pharmacy Institution of Novi Sad, was established Pharmacy Waste transfer station in 2011. There were collected and classified drugs from 34 pharmacies that people dispose in containers placed in pharmacies. It can be seen that the percentage of deferred and unused medications is large. Boxes and blisters that make phar-maceutical waste, indicating that some of the prescribed S1 PP 4096Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 95 - 96 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsdrugs, because most of the drugs are from the list of pre-scription, half- used and unopened. It would be a huge harm that drugs were not used and did not contribute to im-proving therapeutic outcomes, were not collected as phar-maceutical waste, and accidentally found exposed to the influence of atmospheric factors and reaches the soil or wa-ter, which is an immense and immeasurable danger to the environment and for human health.In addition to the organized collection and classifica-tion, pharmacists at Public Pharmacy Institution of Novi Sad organized and proper storage of pharmaceutical waste for transport and destruction are is done by registered com-panies. This waste with appropriate documentation is ex-ported and destroyed in the neighboring countries that have organized incinerators such as Hungary and Poland.IPA grants supported transport and destruction of ex-pired drugs stored in Pharmacy Waste transfer station 2011 to 2013. From 2013, more than 5 tones of expired drugs are stored in Pharmacy Waste transfer station and still waiting to be destroyed.The Law on pharmaceutical waste in Serbia has not regulated who is responsible for payment of transport and destruction of pharmaceutical waste. Most of stored drugs in Pharmacy Waste transfer station in Public Pharmacy In-stitution of Novi Sad are drugs for cardiovascular diseases (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel Blockers), antipsychotics, anal-gesics (diclofenak), antibiotics, drug for diabetes (metfor-min, sulfonylureas, insulins), sleeping pills (barbiturates) and some antineoplastics.The action performed by pharmacists within Public Pharmacy Institution of Novi Sad contributed to the dis-posal of a part of pharmaceutical waste arising in the ter-ritory of Novi Sad and its surroundings, but it is not suffi-cient, since remained uncovered other possible \u201c produc-ers \u201c of pharmaceutical waste such as hospitals, outpatients department, within the dental, medical centers, institutes, private pharmacies, veterinary clinics and others. It is nec-essary a large-scale action that will lead to the organized collection of pharmaceutical waste from all sorts of \u201cpro-ducers\u201d and then the waste must be classified and kept un-til destruction.ReferencesBound, J.P., Voulvoulis, N., 2005.

Given the extent of this problem there is the need to find integrated approaches across society in an effort to prevent and identify individuals at risk.There is a significant opportunity for a coordinated and synergistic action between pharmacies and primary care regarding the promotion of primary and secondary preven-tion of diabetes.AimThis study aim was to assess the risk of diabetes type 2 in the patients of the community pharmacy and subsequent personalized assistance, in particular the recommendation for the medical consultation of patients with high and very high risk of type 2 diabetes. Has also aimed sensitize the population to the problem of diabetes, inform and educate about the risk factors and promote ways to control them.Materials and methodsFor two weeks between, 14 to 28 November 2015 the pharmacy assessed the risk of type 2 diabetes of its pa-tients. Promoting information and education about the dis-ease, informed about the risk factors and strategies to con-trol, advising also individually each patient to adopt the most appropriate measures, maintaining healthy lifestyles. Prompting the patient for the necessary monitoring, includ-ing medical, in situations where there was a greater risk of diabetes.Thus, all patients over 18 years old, who visited the pharmacy were invited to participate in the study.It was made a qualitative interview to all patients in-cluded in the study, and all data was collected in order to follow the design observational study.Patients diagnosed with diabetes or taking medications for diabetes and pregnant women were excludedWe applied the questionnaire \u201cEvaluation Sheet Dia-betes Risk Type 2\u201d of the Portuguese national program for diabetes, (adapted from the WHO International Diabetes Program, with the international score purpose, DGS 2008) to determine the risk of getting type 2 diabetes within 10 years.Questionnaire variables were: gender, age, weight and height, waist circumference, anti-hypertensives in taking, family history of diabetes, habits and lifestyles and history of high blood glucose levels.The questionnaire consists of 8 Likert questions, al-lowing immediate calculation of the score based on the responses. Since the scale determines the risk of having type 2 diabetes within 10 years. A score less than 7 points, was considered very low risk, the patient was only warned to keep styles and healthy life. A score between 7 and 11 points, was considered low risk, although the risk is slight the patient was warned to continue maintaining healthy lifestyles. A score between 12 and 14 points, was consid-ered moderate risk, the patient should adopt healthy life-styles and review their risk factors. A score between 15 and 20 points, was considered high risk, the patient should in the next doctor\u2019s appointment tell the doctor about his risk S1 PP 4198Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 97 - 98 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsof diabetes. Finally a score higher than 20 points, was con-sidered very high risk, the patient was informed that he must consult his doctor and inform it about his risk of di-abetes.In light of this evaluation, each of the assessed pa-tients had specific information about his individual risk and about the needs and behaviors that should adopt regard-ing the prevention of diabetes. In cases where the risk was highest was recommended seeking medical care.The risk factors considered for diabetes were: age above 45 years old, overweight (BMI> 25 kgm2) or obese (BMI> 30Kgm2), waist circumference more than 94 cm for men or 80 cm in women , sedentary lifestyle (less than 30 minutes a day of physical activity), family history of dia-betes in first grade, hypertension or dyslipidemia, previ-ous history of cardiovascular disease, blood glucose ab-normalities in fasting and previous impaired glucose tol-erance, prior gestational diabetes, and use of drugs predis-posing to diabetes.The data presented after performed the statistics anal-ysis include descriptive information from the patients and the narratives of qualitative data.Results and discussionIn these two weeks, we included 85 patients. The sam-ple was mostly formed by women, 69.7%. There were 26.7% patients younger than 45 years old, 27% had be-tween 45 and 54 years old and 46.6% were over 55 years old. It was found that 51.1% had a BMI lower than 25kgm2, but 63.3% of women had a waist circumference exceeding 88 cm and 34.6% of men exceeding 102 cm. As for physi-cal activity 50% of men said to practice at least 30 minutes a day and only 41.6% of women did it. However 93.0% ate any vegetables or fruit every days. About 43% of the sam-ple was taking anti hypertensives. As for family history of diabetes type 1 or type 2, 48.8% of subjects had no history and 48.8% did not report any episodes of high blood sug-ar in any health examination. However we obtained 18.6% of patients with very low risk, 39.5% with low risk, 20.9% with moderate risk, 18.6% with high risk and 2.3% with very high risk. This assessment score has potential as a tool to iden-tify a high risk group of DM2/pre-DM2 among communi-ty pharmacy patients, especially, when used together with information from health care providers. There is evidence that intensive lifestyle and various pharmacotherapeutic interventions decrease the incidence of DM2 or even can delay the progression of DM2 among persons with predi-abetes Therefore this population mainly formed by women with a sedentary lifestyle and overweight may gain if mod-ify their lifestyles. Since they have non-modifiable fac-tors such as age and gender, pharmacist can help in order to persuade the patient to lose weight and decrease of ab-dominal circumference. With a non pharmacological inter-vention this patients can improve their diabetes assessment and also the pharmacist may give a good help to obtain this objective. ConclusionThe participation of pharmacy, translated into a large number of patients at risk of diabetes evaluated in this ini-tiative is a critical success factor for the demonstration of Pharmacy relevance in the development of new forms of collaboration recoverable by the health system. Besides the contribution of this initiative to combat diabetes, we are also making an important step in the development of dif-ferentiating initiatives pharmacy as indispensable to a net-work of modern health care, efficient and citizen-centeredThere was a strong recommendation for medical con-sultation of patients with high risk and very high of type 2 diabetes and was intended to sensitize the population to the problem of diabetes. Information and education about the risk factors of diabetes is one way to avoid in the future more diabetic patients and to avoid the excessive waste of money with their treatment. Having a better understanding about the disease, the evaluation of the risk factors to pre-vent the illness and also to control it, have certainly phar-macoeconomical repercussion in the wastes of national health systems economy and mainly advantage for the pop-ulation that use the pharmacy services and accepts the dai-ly work of the pharmacists.

The term antibiotics, which means \u2018\u2018against life\u2019\u2019, is de-rived from the fact that an antibacterial drug is extracted from living things and used to kill or attenuate bacteria. However, there is a tight correlation between longer dura-tion and multiple courses of antibiotic uptake and higher rates of bacterial resistance.In recent decades, the emergence and spread of bac-terial resistance to antibiotics is an ongoing threat world-wide, which presents a significant threat to public health globally in the 21st century. The increase of antibiotics re-sistance will decrease their therapeutic effectiveness, in-crease treatment failures and, as a result, lead to longer and more severe illness episodes with higher costs and mortal-ity rates.As more strains of bacteria become resistant to an ev-er-larger number of antibiotics, our drug choices will be-come increasingly limited and expensive and, in some cas-es, nonexistent. If this trend continues unchecked, a wide range of modern medical procedures, from basic dental care to organ transplants, likely would be accompanied by a much greater risk of developing a difficult-to-treat or un-treatable antibiotic infection. The safety of many modern medical procedures is dependent on the ability to treat bac-terial infections that can arise as post treatment complica-tions. The aim of this study is to measure the levels of knowl-edge of the population about the effectiveness of antibiot-ics and risks associated with their unnecessary use.Materials and methodsA cross sectional survey using a validated question-naire, conducted among the general public in Kosovo, during the months of October and November 2014. The English version of the questionnaire from Eurobarometer (2008) (Special Eurobarometer 407, Antimicrobial Resis-tance, May \u2013 June 2013), was adapted and translated into Albanian. A random convenience sample of 392 people was included in this study. The questionnaire consisted of 6 questions.The respondents in the sample are mainly from Prishti-na as the largest city, the capital of Kosovo that has a va-riety of locations, people from the town or villages. The questionnaire application was made in different places like in some private pharmacy, family medical centers and lab-oratories, people on the streets, in some Dental Clinics, Medical Private Clinics, Homes and the University. The data was digitally stored and analyzed using Microsoft Ex-cel. Descriptive statistics were carried out by providing the number and percentage of each of the demographic vari-ables as well as knowledge about the questions of antibi-otics.Results and discussionFrom 392 patients, 194 were males (49.49%) and 198 females (50.50%). Median age is 51 years (range 15 - 74 years).The subjects in the survey were asked to rank from their knowledge of antibiotics as low, middle or high. From 392 respondents 184 (46.94%) said that they knowledge of antibiotics is middle, 149 (38.01%) said that they have low S1 PP 42100Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 99 - 100 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsknowledge of antibiotics and 59 (15.05%) said that they have high knowledge of antibiotics.The study also has one declaration and asked the re-spondents if they \u2018agree\u2019 \u2018disagree\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019 that all of us have a responsibility towards the effectivity of anti-biotics. 249 (63.52%) of the respondents agreed with this declaration, 86 (21.94%) said they did not know and 49 (12.50%) did not agree with this declaration. A further 8 (2.04%) respondents did not want to answer this question.Respondents were asked if each of the following four statements about antibiotics (Antibiotics kill viruses; Anti-biotics are effective against colds and flu; Unnecessary use of antibiotics makes them become ineffective; Taking an-tibiotics often has side-effects, such as diarrhea) was \u2018true\u2019 \u2018false\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019.Almost half of the respondents 176 (44.90%) said that it is true that antibiotics kill viruses, 116 (29.59%) said that it is false that antibiotics do not have effectiveness on viral infection and 100 (25.51%) responded they do not know if antibiotics kill viruses. A large majority 210 (53.57%) of those polled gave the correct answer that the overuse of antibiotics reduc-es their effectiveness. Just 71 (18.11%) gave us the wrong answer that it is \u2018false\u2019 and 111 (28.32%) \u2018do not know\u2019 if that is true or not.Antibiotics are effective against cold and flu which is \u2018false\u2018and the right answer to this question was obtained from only 116 (29.59%) of respondents. More than half of the respondents answered wrong by stating that is \u2018True\u2018 that antibiotics are effective against the cold and flu 220 (56.12%) whereas 56 (14.29%) others answered that they don\u2019t know.Respondents were asked whether taking antibiotics of-ten has side effects such as diarrhea. 241 (61.48%) of the respondents gave the correct answer that antibiotics can produce side-effects. There is more uncertainty over this issue than the preceding ones: 130 (33.16%) of the respon-dents were unable to give an answer to this question. A slightly smaller proportion 20 (5.10%) gave an incorrect answer. This is in accordance with several other studies (Awad and Aboud, 2015; Mouhieddine et al., 2014; Sirijo-ti et al., 2014; Widayati et al., 2012;)ConclusionThe finding in this study showed that the majority of the population had a moderate level of knowledge and attitudes in relation to antibiotics, by using them for wrong reasons and in the wrong way. We believe that this study may be useful in increasing people\u2019s knowledge for the correct use of antibiotics and their awareness concerning the risks of inappropriate use of them, because of the developing resistance of antibiotics.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 1992; WHO, 2001), mood disorders are the fourth cause of morbidity and mortality with a tendency to move to the second place by the 2020. The prediction that there is going to be an increase in the number of ill in the future comes from the facts that the factors of risk, like stress, are in constant rise, that the de-mographic image (ageing of the population) is changing which has an effect on the rise of comorbidity of these ill-nesses with the chronic illnesses of the elderly population and that the incidence of genetically predisposed depres-sions increases etc. Patients with depression are often not in a state to cor-rectly apply the prescribed pharmacological therapy which leads to cessation/disruption of therapy, inadequate treat-ment of depression which as a consequence has frequent hospitalizations, incapability to work and are marginalised and stigmatised by the community. That is why a pharma-cist through an interdisciplinary approach and appliance of pharmaceutical care can affect the proper selection of ther-apy and can also make a follow up of the patient, counsel him/her about the side effects and interactions, and final-ly improve the quality of life of the patient suffering from depression which is the final goal of including pharmacists and pharmaceutical care into a multidisciplinary team (Bi-nakaj, 2015). Keeping track of compliance and concor-dance in use of the medication for the nervous system is of special importance. The development of pharmaceuti-cal studies, increase of pharmaceutical industry as well as the changes in healthcare systems and policies sets addi-tional challenges which include continuous monitoring of the needs of patients as well as the trade and consumption of medications for the sake of rational medication admin-istration. To define, describe and question the role of pharma-cists in the treatment of patients suffering from depression, as well as measure the impact of pharmaceutical care on significant parameters in treatment of depression like the selection of appropriate therapy according to the guide-lines, adherence of the patient, quality of life, work capa-bility, anxiety, side-effects and interactions.Materials and methodsThe study is a randomised controlled clinical study in which a psychiatrist in General Hospital Tesanj will ran-domise patients according to the methods of random se-lection and the criteria of inclusion and exclusion defined in the protocol. The target population is adult patients 18 to 75 years old who suffer from diagnosed depressive ep-isodes (according to the criteria set up for the diagnosis) and who are treated in General Hospital Tesanj (Bosnia and Herzegovina). A pharmacist will set up monthly appoint-ments for the patients and educate them about depression and medications with a special review of side-effects and interactions of medications. During this study the pharma-cist and the doctor will have two meetings where they will analyze observations of the pharmacist and evaluate the impact of pharmaceutical care with the intervention group. S1 PP 43102Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 101 - 102 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsThe standard group will only fill in the questionnaire about quality of life during their regular visit to the doctor at the beginning of the study, after three months and after six months of the study. The gathered data will be analyzed with the SPSS software for statistical analysis of data and it will include qualitative and quantitative elements.Results and discussionForty eight patients were monitored in this research, 11 men and 37 women, where we notice that the incidence of depression is more frequent in women, which is also vis-ible in the research of WHO 2008.During this research three tests were conducted using which we gathered information which showed us the sig-nificance of a pharmacist in the treatment of patients suf-fering from depression. Consideration of the anxiety test showed that the treatment with a team which includes a pharmacist compared to a team without a pharmacist shows progress in the treatment because there was a sig-nificant decrease in irritability and anxiety. 56% of the pa-tients had these symptoms during the first visit while this figure in the third visit was 4.3%. When considering the questions from the life quality test we didn\u2019t get significant results which showed us progress in the patient\u2019s depres-sion treatment with the presence of a pharmacist in an in-terdisciplinary team. Also, the patients\u2019 life test showed us the contribution of the pharmacists in the treatment of pa-tients with depression.These results showed us that the pharmacist should be included in the interdisciplinary team which takes care of the treatment of patients with depression and by further ed-ucating the pharmacist in the area of mental disorders, es-pecially depression; even better results would be achieved. A research conducted in Belgium about the role of phar-macists in the care of patients with depression showed that pharmacists are not sufficiently involved in the treatment of patients with depression as well as the insufficient edu-cation of the pharmacists regarding mental disorders (Liek-ens et al., 2012). Pharmacists are the most devoted health professionals \u2013 patients visit pharmacists seven times more than they visit doctors. These data show us that pharma-cists through pharmaceutical care can make the fastest and the cheapest contribution to a good outcome of this multi-disciplinary approach in the treatment of patients with de-pression.ConclusionThe high prevalence of depression and anxiety disor-ders and the trend of growth of the affected demand a de-tailed analysis of causes, treatment, cormobidity and in-teractions, as well as keeping track of the consumption of medications for the rehabilitation of symptoms caused by these disorders which in the future could facilitate im-provement of adherence, the effect of therapy and im-provement in quality of life.ReferencesBinakaj, Z., 2015.

AleksanderMoisiu, Nr.84 Tirana, Albania;2Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Medicine, Rr e Dibres,371,1005, Tirana, Albania;3University Hospital Center \u201cMother Teresa\u201d, Rr. e Dibres, 372, Tirana, Albania* erinahilaj@yahoo.comIntroductionIn Albania, neoplasm is the second leading cause of death following circulatory system diseases. Within neo-plasms, breast cancer is the second most frequent cancer after lung cancer (INSTAT, 2016). Breast cancer treatment generally involves multiple approaches including surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Adjuvant treatment is the administration of additional therapy after primary surgery to kill or inhibit micrometastasis (Tarifa et al., 2007). De-pending on the model of risk reduction, adjuvant therapy has been estimated to be responsible for 35-72% reduction in mortality rate (Newton and Grethlein, 2015).The adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer has changed several times since the first effective chemother-apy regimen for breast cancer CMF, (cyclophosphamide; methotrexate; 5-fluorouracil) was developed (Bonadonna et al., 1976).To date, there is no \u2018gold standard\u2019 regimen in adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer. The diversity of the disease depending on biomarkers, the proliferation process and di-versity of trials, with different interpretations, has led to endless suppositions and discussion on the best treatment. However, there is general agreement that CMF-like regi-mens are \u2018better than nothing\u2019, that anthracycline-contain-ing regimens are better than CMF, and that the taxanes fur-ther add to the benefit of anthracyclines (Peto, 2007).The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of ad-juvant chemotherapy, taxane-based regiment with anthra-cycline- based regiment in woman with breast cancer in Albania.Materials and methodsA case-series study was conducted at the University Hospital Center \u201cMother Teresa\u201d in Tirana including 181 women diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with ad-juvant chemotherapy. Women included in this study had an age range 18-70 years, with stage I-III of breast cancer irrespective of nodal, hormonal, or HER2 status. Respec-tively, 35 women were treated with taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen and 146 women were treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen after primary surgery. The clinical diagnosis was based on biop-sy findings. A 5-year follow-up of took place where the re-lapse experience was recorded for all women included in this study. Results and discussionTaxane\u2013based regimen has become the most popular adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in the last decade (Jones et al., 2009). Overall, in our study there were 35 women treated with taxane-based regimen. In the group of wom-en treated with taxane-based (paclitaxel or docetaxel) regi-men as adjuvant chemotherapy, 8 (22.9%) of them experi-enced relapse within four years compared with 27 (77.1%) women who did not manifest relapse after the fourth year of follow-up. The distribution of relapse time among wom-en treated with 4AC-4T(paclitaxel or docetaxel) was as follows: there were 2 women (5.7%) who experienced a relapse within the first 12 months; 2 (5.7%) within 24 months; 1 (2.9%) within 36 months; and 3 (8.6%) women within 48 months. Conversely, 27 (77.1%) did not manifest relapses after the fourth year of follow-up.         Overall, in our study there were 142 women treated S1 PP 44104Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 103 - 104 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationswith anthracycline-based regimen. In the group of  women treated with anthracycline-based regimen (CAF (N=142, or 97.3%) or AC-CMF (N=4, or 2.7%) of adjuvant chemotherapy, overall 34 (24.5%) of them experienced relapse within four years compared with 105 (75.5%) women who did not manifest relapses after the fourth year of follow-up.  On the whole, 6 (4.3%) women experienced a relapse within the first 12 months; 13 (9.4%) within 24 months; 6 (4.3%) within 36 months; and 9 (6.5%) women within 48 months. On the other hand, 105 (75.5%) did not manifest relapses after the fourth year of follow-up.         After 5 years of follow-up, there was an improvement in relapse-free survival between taxane-based regiment and anthracycline based regiment (77.1% vs 75.5%). Ben-efits were observed irrespectively of nodal, hormonal or HER2 status.The 2011 EBCTCG meta-analysis also included tax-anes such as docetaxel and paclitaxel in its analysis of ad-juvant therapy. Incorporation of taxanes into an anthracy-cline containing regimen resulted at 8 years in the reduc-tion of the risk of recurrence, risk of breast cancer mortali-ty, and overall mortality. This benefit was present irrespec-tive of age, nodal status, tumor size, tumor grade or estro-gen receptor (ER) status (Peto et al., 2012). Our study obtained similar results, regardless of the small size sample. Hence, incorporation of taxanes such as docetaxel or paclitaxel into adjuvant chemotherapy reg-imens led to a reduction in disease recurrence. This benefit was evident independent of age, nodal status, tumor size, tumor grade, estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 status. ConclusionAfter 5 years of follow-up, there was an improvement in relapse-free survival between taxane-based regimen and anthracycline-based regimen respectively 77.1% and 75.5% in Albanian women diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy.  Benefits were observed irrespectively of nodal, hormonal, or HER2 status. These findings have important implications for practitioners and policy-makers in Albania and beyond.

Cyril and Methodius,  Majka Tereza 47, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* alka@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionColorectal cancer (CRC), with an estimated 447,000 new cases and an estimated 215,000 deaths occurring in 2012,  is the second most common cancer and also the sec-ond most common cause of cancer death in Europe (Gra-ham et al., 2014). The incidence of CRC is strongly re-lated to age (83% of cases occurring in patients who are aged 60 years or older). The ageing population and glob-al effect of \u201cwesternization\u201d are additional factors driving a rapid increase in new CRC cases worldwide. As a conse-quence, the already significant societal burden of CRC is likely to increase over time. Important economic compo-nents of this burden include direct medical care costs, di-rect nonmedical costs (such as patient time involved with receiving medical care), and productivity losses among pa-tients and caregivers (Yabroff et al., 2013). The most important CRC prognostic factor is the disease stage at the time of diagnosis (from a 90% of 5-year survival rate for cancers detected at the localized stage; 70% for regional; to 10% for people diagnosed for distant metastatic cancer).  Approximately 25% of newly diagnosed patients have already developed metastases; al-most 50% of all CRC patients will form metastases over time as the disease progresses. Metastatic colorectal can-cer (mCRC) is characterised by a high mortality rate. In the last decade, fluoropirimidine drugs (5-fluoro-uracil-FU and leucovorin -LV) combined with oxaliplat-in or irinotecan chemotherapy regimens (FOLFOX and FOLFIRI), were best available mCRC treatment. In re-cent years, the significantly increased mCRC survival rates have resulted mainly from the introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as additional first-line treatment to che-motherapy or in subsequent treatment lines (Lange et al., 2014). According to the European Society for Medical Oncol-ogy (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines for mCRC, beva-cizumab (mAb against the vascular endothelial growth fac-tor -VEGF) and panitumumab and cetuximab (which bind the epidermal growth factor receptor - EGFR) in combina-tion with chemotherapy can be considered as first line op-tions for selected patients with mCRC. The ESMO recom-mendations are based on the improved outcomes report-ed for these biologics versus chemotherapy alone in clini-cal trials (Van Cutsem et al., 2010). Despite the established therapeutic efficacy and safety, this new mAbs based che-motherapy regimens have dramatically increased the cost of treatment.  Pharmacoeconomic assessments are a part of the deci-sion process not only during reimbursement setting, but in clinical practice as well. Estimates of the costs associated with cancer care are essential both for assessing burden of disease at the population level and for conducting econom-ic evaluations of interventions to prevent, detect, or treat cancer. Comparisons of cancer costs between health sys-tems and across countries can improve understanding of the economic consequences of different health-care poli-cies and programs.The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effec-tiveness/ utility of bevacizumab plus FOLFOX   vs.  FOLF-OX alone in 1st line treatment of patients with mCRC from the payer perspective in R.

The model uses a 2-week cycle length and a time horizon of 2 years post treatment initiation.  The en-tire patient population was composed of a simulated co-hort of 100 mCRC patients/treatment branch. The patients progressed through the decision tree based on the risk of early therapy discontinuations because of severe toxicity (ST), disease progression (DP) and cancer associated death (CAD) during active treatment. After completion of the first 2 cycles of chemotherapy, patients without experienced ST from first-line therapy (FOLFOX \u00b1 bavacizumab) are con-tinuing the treatment until DP. For patients with intolera-ble toxicity, first-line therapy is discontinued and second-line FOLFIRI is offered until DP. Upon progression, all pa-tients receive best supportive care until death. The transi-tion probabilities between the health states for bevacizumab plus FOLXOX and FOLFOX alone treatment were based on parametric survival curves estimated in a patient-level anal-ysis of progression free survival (PFS) and overall surviv-al (OS) from the NO16966 clinical trial (Saltz et al., 2008). Only direct costs (bevacizumab and FOLFOX che-motherapy), were included in the analysis. Drug-acquisition costs were calculated utilizing official government and hos-pital pharmacy publicly available data. All costs are report-ed in 2016 Euros. The benefit and performance of medical treatments, measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were extracted from the published data (Ramsey et al., 2000, 2002).  The incremental cost per QALY gained was calcu-lated as the difference in total costs divided by difference in QALY. All costs and outcomes (benefits) in the model were discounted using discount rate of 3.5% per annum. A sensitivity analyses on the estimates of costs, utili-ties, and health state transitions were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model and address uncertainty of vari-ables. In univariable sensitivity analyses, we varied the val-ue of costs and utilities within \u00b1 20% of their baseline values and examined the effect on the ICER. In probabilistic sen-sitivity analyses (PSAs), we ran the model 1000 times, each time randomly varying all parameters simultaneously. We used uniform distribution for cost parameters and gaussian distribution for the efficacy parametars and discount factor. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of both the Macedonian public and private health care systems.Results and discussionBase case analyses The initial drug costs for bevacizumab +FOLFOX compared to FOLFOX were estimated at \u20ac2312.86 and \u20ac451.22, respectively, per 2-week cycle. In the primary analysis, the effectiveness and costs were compared in the first-line model for the FOLFOX and FOLFOX-plus-bevacizumab groups. FOLFOX provided 1.31 QALYs  at a cost of  \u20ac1963.86. FOLFOX plus bevacizumab provided 1.41 QALYs at a cost of \u20ac11021.899. The ICER for FOLFOX plus bevacizumab was \u20ac90580.374 per QALY.Sensitivity analysisAccording to the sensitivity analyses results, the base case model is robust to alternative parameters and assumptions. The parameters with the greatest influence on the ICERs were median OS and PFS for each regimen, drug cost of bevacizumab, and utility values for living with mCRC. The discount factor had a minor influence on the ICER in the first-line model. The PSA indicate that 82% of simulations performed showed bevacizumab plus FOLFOX to be more effective and more costly than FOLFOX chemotherapy alone.ConclusionBased on the model projections, the introduction of bevacizumab to the standard FOLFOX chemotherapy protocols for mCRC treatment resulted in longer survival and greater QALYs than FOLFOX alone at an incremental cost of \u20ac 90580.374 per quality adjusted life-year gained.ReferencesGraham, C.N., Hechmati, G., Hjelmgren, J., de Li\u00e8ge, F., Lanier, J., Knox, H., Barber, B., 2014.

Cyril and Methodius, MajkaTereza 47, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* alka@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionOver-the-counter (OTC) drugs are medicines that can be used safely and effectively by the general public with-out a prescription. Available for sale directly to a consum-er, they are one of the most important and easily accessible public health aids for the treatment of common conditions or symptomatic relief (H\u00e5konsen, et al., 2016; Halvorsen et al., 2016). In the last 10 years, many medicines that were originally prescription only have now become available over the counter (OTC), either from pharmacies or oth-er general retail outlets (Bond et al., 2003). However, cer-tain cases of misuse or overuse of OTC drug products re-sulting in adverse drug events have been recorded, lead-ing to the conclusion that they may not be totally harmless. Although there are different means of providing the con-sumers with drug information, the advertising, used by the pharmaceutical companies, is one of the best and power-ful methods for information broadcasting and introducing these products to the consumers (Hanna et al., 2010 Major, et al., 2010). Thus, trying to make appropriate recommen-dations and decisions regarding OTC medications can be tempting for the community pharmacists and daunting and confusing for patients (Cooper et al., 2013).The aim of this study was to examine the advertising influence on pharmacist and consumers attitudes in selec-tion of OTC medicines.Materials and methodsThe multicenter, observational cross-sectional study was conducted at 70 randomly selected community pharma-cies in Skopje, R. Macedonia. Data were collected during one shift at each pharmacy. The instrument used for investi-gating the research questions in this the study is a previous-ly validated survey available in the literature (Potnis, 2012). Pharmacists were provided with a printed copy of survey. Variables measured in this study are the cumula-tive scores for pharmacists\u2019 perceptions of OTC drug ad-vertising concerning their recommendations and consum-er selection of over-the-counter drugs.  The questionnaire included 27 items divided into 2 sections. Section I of the questionnaire was comprised of seven questions measur-ing the demographic variables (gender, years of practicing as a pharmacist, practice setting, location of the pharmacy, frequency of exposure on OTC drug advertisements, aver-age weekly OTC prescription volume and medium of OTC drug advertisements) related to the pharmacists\u2019 practice. Section II  was comprised of 20 questions (divided in 4 subsections),  measuring pharmacists experience regard-ing: 1) pharmacists\u2019 beliefs about the effects of over-the-counter drug advertising, 2) impact of OTC drug adver-tising on pharmacists\u2019 recommendations, 3) influence of OTC drug advertising on patients\u2019 choice of the drug prod-ucts, 4) Effect of over-the-counter drug advertising on pa-tient pharmacist interactions. The subsection 1 and 2 con-sisted of 4 questions, while sections 3 and 4 comprised of 6 questions. All questions from section II were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (items rated from one to five; \u20181\u2019 denoting \u2018Strongly Agree\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 denoting \u2018Strongly Dis-agree\u2019). With each item having a maximum possible score of five, the highest score for the beliefs measure, consisting of four or six questions, was 20 or 30, respectively.  Phar-macists, whose cumulative score for the above items was found to be less than or equal to 10 or 15 were consid-ered to believe that over-the-counter drug advertising has a great effect on the measured variable. The obtained data were descriptively analyzed.S1 PP 46108Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 107 - 108 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsResults and discussionAll of the participants were females (100%) work-ing in large chain pharmacies, previously defined as phar-macies with more than or equal to 12 stores (61.1%). Ap-proximately 33.3% of the pharmacist worked in small chain pharmacies (with 1-12 stores). Most of the phar-macists were working in pharmacies located in urban re-gions (81.5%) with most of them practicing for 1-10 years (70.6%). Approximately 59.3% of the surveyed pharma-cists mentioned coming across over-the-counter drug ad-vertisements/informations for 1- 5 times a week. Mar-keting representatives, as reported by 45% of the partic-ipants, were found to be the medium where the pharma-cists gain most of the over-the-counter drug informations, followed by internet (33.3%). A large number of pharma-cists (31.4%) were working at a pharmacy with a volume of prescriptions between 100-150 and more than 200 OTC drugs /week.A majority of the surveyed pharmacists (61.5%) were found to have a cumulative score of 8 and thus believe that over-the-counter drug advertising has a great effect on pa-tients. Approximately 77.7% of the pharmacists had a cu-mulative score of 12 and agreed that over-the-counter drug advertising does not impact on pharmacists\u2019 recommenda-tions. A large number (81.4%) of pharmacists, based on a score of 14 agreed that the patients choice of the drug prod-ucts was largely influenced by over-the-counter drug ad-vertising. In all, 51.8% of the pharmacists, with a score of 12, were of the opinion that patient - pharmacist inter-actions were increased as a result of the over-the-counter drug advertising.ConclusionThese findings serve as a starting point for addition-al research in the field of over-the-counter drug advertising in our country. Although pharmacists use marketing adver-tisement as a means of information about over-the-coun-ter drugs they strongly believe that their role is to offer patients the best care at the least possible cost and to en-sure that the recommendations regarding OTC drug pro-vides enough revenue to maximize its value to the patient. Considering that patients choice of the OTC drug products is greatly influenced by over-the-counter drug ad-vertising in order to promote a rational usage of the OTC drug the advertisement has to contain all necessary patient information in a way that is clear and understandable and to encourage patients to carefully read the package leaflet or instructions. In view of the fact that in recent years, di-rect-to-consumer advertising of OTC drugs has increased all advertisements must give a clear message that the ad-vertised product is a medicinal product.ReferencesBond, C., Hannaford, P., 2003.

Pharmacy, unlike chemistry and biology is not just science, rather, it is a profession that encompasses a broad range of academic and professional disciplines that are based on science, business, sociology and law. Pharmaceutical law as a discipline of recent date, although its foundation and academic profiling is an area that legally has be present in order to develop different approached to problems, and to cooperate with pharmaceutical science and practice (Ap-pelbe and Wingfild, 1997). The rules in pharmaceutical laws may be universally agreed and respected or may be controversial and applied only in part or only by some of those concerned, so this article seeks to provide an outline of the law that affects the pharmacy.Pharmacy lawInterdisciplinary is a kind of cooperation where experts from various academic disciplines work in order to achieve common outcomes. The past decade has witnessed an un-precedented interest and controversy surrounding in ethi-cal and legal aspects of health, including pharmaceutical care. One reason for the establishment and development of such program as pharmaceutical law, is the conviction that traditionally established disciplines individually are unable to solve key problems. What is more there are many oth-er areas of law and regulation affecting the industry, con-cerning, for example the pricing of medicines, the conduct of clinical studies, the health protection and health care in-surance (Dukes, 2006). In some fields it is hardly impos-sible to maintain standards through regulation. So we can freely say that the manner and quality of the relationship on both sides (pharmacy and law) depends on boosting over-all pharmaceutical activity and protection. This suggests that the pharmacy and law although at first glance are two mutually different areas, still they have numerous and im-portant common ground. Considering that, interdisciplin-ary approach of pharmaceutical law is very complex and requires knowledge of the lawyers in the pharmaceuticals-but also demands from pharmaceutical professionals bet-ter knowledge of the legal institutions whose application refers to them.This pharmacy-law relationship puts the task of phar-macists not only in the implementation of regulations re-lated to pharmaceutical law, but also needs the right ap-proach to shape legal institutions to regulate rights and ob-ligations, which requires a very serious approach by legal experts. The pharmacists work reaches out to entire com-munity. Pharmaceutical law in an objective sense consti-tute a set of laws governing pharmaceutical activity, regu-late the rights and obligations of health professionals and their relationship to the beneficiaries. It is especially im-portant to emphasize that this discipline also called, \u201claw for drugs\u201d covers the legal definition and corresponding action to the pharmaceutical care of the individual in the health care system (Mujovik-Zornik, 2008). It covers parts of the regulation for legal issues relating to the manufac-ture, trade and use of drugs in the context of health care. For this reason pharmaceutical law is broadly viewed as an integral part of health law or legislation. Pharmaceutical law as a discipline is recognizable recent, and appears separately in order to identify first of all regulatory aspects in the definition and implementation of health legislation. The need and the existence of these S1 PP 47110Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 109 - 110 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationstwo disciplines (medical and pharmaceutical law), on the one hand requires their integration and harmonization, and on the other hand allow consideration of legal problems from different aspects.For example, from the perspective of medical law separates the part of pharmaceutical regulation under which person (patient) consumed drugs comes into contact with them, but again portions over a health or medical procedures undertaken in connection therewith. This will also mean that aspects of pharmaceutical law, which relate to public or rather socially significant issues associated with the production of pharmaceuticals, intellectual property rights, and advertising may appear as second.Unlike traditional branches of law, pharmaceutical law is not specifically codified but is defined by the field governed not uncommon liaison with ethical norms associated with this regulated profession, because it is a limited legal area, which refers to a profession and those who use its services. This arises and specificity of pharmaceutical law and its sources are simultaneously multiple of a different nature, legal and professional (intellectual property rights and norms associated with putting drugs on the market, quality and safety of medicines and other pharmaceutical products, health care insurance, competition, advertising, ethical codes, etc.).Therefore, all legal norms and regulations of pharma-ceutical law recognize and affect each other, because a de-cision to bring a specific legal issue entails application of the regulation and other areas of law (Junod, 2006). This indicates that the rules of pharmaceutical law have their own specifics, but when it comes to legally relevant com-plex cases, its use is public law and regulation, private and often even criminal character. Considering the consti-tutionally guaranteed right to health as a universal value, (The Constitution of the World Health Organization-1946 states that the \u201cenjoyment of the highest attainable stan-dard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every hu-man being without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social position \u201c) pharmaceutical law as part of health activity has the same characteristics.Although still in development in our country the national legislation related to these issues is in the process of harmonizing with the standards as in the other EU member states. Promotion of pharmaceutical law as a discipline and the ongoing debate on current issues of legal theory and practice is of great scientific and professional importance. Presence as a special study program at a growing number of faculties, slowly gaining status, along with medical law as a scientific discipline that is taught and continually exploring.ReferencesAppelbe, G.

Recent study in Serbia showed the pres-ence of pharmaceuticals in water samples collected from 25 locations (in total 47 out of 81 investigated drugs were detected) (Petrovi\u0107 et al., 2014).Although more research is needed to properly estimate the risk and the impact of measured concentrations of the pharmaceuticals on the environment and on human health, it is clear that more attention needs to be paid to this issue in coming years. This is especially because the production rate of pharmaceutical waste is constantly growing world-wide as a consequence of increased use of pharmaceuticals (Smith, 2002).Pharmaceutical waste management is complex chal-lenge requiring compliance with of health and environmen-tal regulations as well as involvement of all parties includ-ed in providing and receiving of health service. To mini-mize the risk of uncontrolled pharmaceutical waste dispos-al preventive measures and systematic drug-take back pro-grams are needed. However, equally important prerequi-site for success of the whole process is enhanced commu-nication to the public on proper pharmaceutical waste man-agement. And for that purpose pharmacists can and should play key role. Focus of this work was to investigate to what extent raising of public awareness is needed and if there are any particular population groups (i.e. regarding education, age) that require additional attention.   Materials and methodsThis research has been conducted among citizens of Serbia. The study included 100people. People in the pharmacies in the cities of Novi Sad, Subotica, Ruma, Arandjelovac and Vlasotince and their country sides, were approached randomly and invited to participate. The anon-ymous questionnaire consisted of 9 questions. Three ques-tions were related to the socio-demographic characteristic of the population, and other six were related to medication storage and disposal. Participants could either complete the questionnaire themselves or have their responses marked by the investigators. Analysis was performed in Excel.Results and discussionOut of total sample size of 100 responders, 10% of re-sponders were from municipality of Arandjelovac, 10% of responders were from Ruma, 9% of responders were from Subotica, 28% responders were from Vlasotince and 43% responders were from Novi Sad. The majority of the exam-inees were from the cities (83%) and 17% from the coun-try sides. Fifty-four percent (54%) of responders had high school degree and forty-one (41%) had university degree. Out of all respondents, 18% were students, 52% were em-ployed and 28% were retired. More than 80% of responders said that they had kept the unused medicine at home.In the questionwhat do they do with unused medicine the examinees most often an-swered \u201cI keep it in a case I may needed it for later\u201d (60%), \u201cI give to other people if they need it\u201d (16%), \u201cI dispose it in the household ban\u201d (19%) and about 5% answered \u201cI re-turn unused medicine to a pharmacist or a doctor\u201d.Also, the examinees were asked about their dispos-al practice of primary packaging of medicines (prescrip-S1 PP 48112Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 111 - 112 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationstion bottles, blister packs, etc.) and 89% of them did this in an environmentally inappropriate way. Answers indicat-ed that primary packaging of medicine was disposed as a house hold waste. Only 7% of the examinees were recy-cling and just 4% reported returning primary packaging to a pharmacy for disposal. This is in line with our previous study where some 87% out of 253 examinees answered to dispose primary packaging as household waste (Gigov et al., 2014).Among the examinees who tried to return unused pharmaceuticals or primary packaging to a pharmacy, only 36% had founded pharmacy that accepted unused pharma-ceuticals, 45% of them were referred to other institution and in a case of 19% of responders the pharmacy could not accepted pharmaceutical waste.Obtained results show that the lack of public aware-ness of pharmaceutical waste management is unfortunate-ly equally distributed throughout the population in Serbia. The majority of the examinees were not informed about proper pharmaceutical waste management. There are no differences between behavior of the responders related to the place where they were interviewed, neither to their ed-ucation nor their employment/student status.ConclusionIt is obvious that further education of the population is needed. Active involvement of the pharmacists is one of the most important steps. Pharmacists due to their educa-tion and their position to daily communicate with the pa-tients about the medicines can offer the most updated and relevant info about pharmaceutical waste management. Raising public awareness with central role of pharma-cists on one hand and introducing a systematic approach in pharmaceutical waste management with preventive mea-sures should decrease a risk of unwanted and potential haz-ardous effect of pharmaceutical waste. This effort should be centrally promoted and supported by government and health sectors in Serbia that should enable a system for continuous education and regular update of the pharma-cists with most recent regulations and trends in pharmaceu-tical waste management.

Cyril and Methodius, MajkaTereza 47, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* biljana.p.indova@gmail.comIntroductionDiabetes is a complex, chronic illness requiring con-tinuous medical care with multifactorial risk-reduction strategies beyond glycemic control. Ongoing patient self-management education and support are critical to prevent acute complications and reduce the risk of long-term com-plications. Hyperglycemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to se-rious damage to many of the body\u2019s systems, especially heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Type 1 di-abetes is characterized by deficient insulin production and requires daily administration of insulin. Diabetes Type 2, results from the body\u2019s ineffective use of insulin and com-prises 90% of people with diabetes around the world, and is largely the result of excess body weight and physical in-activity. Until recently, this type of diabetes was seen only in adults but it is now also occurring in children. Gesta-tional diabetes is hyperglycemia with blood glucose values above normal but below those diagnostic of diabetes, oc-curring during pregnancy. Impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting glycaemia are intermediate conditions in the transition between normality and diabetes. About 347 million people worldwide have diabetes and this number is projected to reach 552 million in 2030 (Whiting et al. 2011). In 2014, 9% of adults (18 years and older) had diabetes. About 6% of Macedonian population has diabetes mellitus, either type 1 or 2. There is an emerg-ing global epidemic of diabetes that can be traced back to rapid increases in overweight, including obesity and phys-ical inactivity. In 2012 diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths. Majority of diabetes deaths (80%) occur in low- and middle-income countries. The overall risk of dy-ing among people with diabetes is at least double the risk of their peers without diabetes (Roglic et al. 2005). Ear-ly diagnosis can be accomplished through blood testing. Treatment of diabetes involves lowering blood glucose and the levels of other known risk factors that damage blood vessels. Nevertheless improvement in diabetes manage-ment in the last years, 33\u201349% of patients still do not meet targets for glycemic, blood pressure, or cholesterol control, and only 14% meet targets for all three measures and non-smoking status (Ali et al., 2013).Patients with diabetes type 2, without cardio vascular disease (CVD) and mikroalbuminemija, are in the catego-ry of patients with very high 10-year risk (13.4\u00b111.4%) of fatal CVD as a result of inadequate glycemic control with a mean HbA1c 9.5\u00b12.0% (recommendations for adequate glycemic control HbA1c < 6.5%) (Smokovski I., 2009). In parallel to healthcare system further development and im-provement, successful diabetes care requires a systematic approach to supporting patients\u2019 behavior change efforts, including: 1. Healthy lifestyle choices (physical activity, healthy eating, tobacco cessation, weight management, and effective coping), 2. Disease self-management (taking and managing medications and, when clinically appropriate, self-monitoring of glucose and blood pressure) and 3. Pre-vention of diabetes complications (self-monitoring of foot health; active participation in screening for eye, foot, and renal complications; and immunizations). High-quality di-abetes self-management education (DSME) in US has been shown to improve patient self-management, satisfaction, and glucose control (Powers, 2015). To date, perception for the importance of self-management in diabetes patients has not been evaluated in Republic of Macedonia (RM).The aim of this paper is to assess the awareness and level of perception of the self-management importance as-sociated with glycemic control achievement in patients from RM.S1 PP 49114Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 113 - 114 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsMaterials and methodsThe study follows a descriptive design using a ques-tionnaire-based survey. The questionnaire was created to assess perception for self-management in diabetes patients using the principles of Diabetes Self-Management Ques-tionnaire developed at the Research Institute of the Dia-betes Academy Mergentheim (Schmitt et al., 2013). First part of the questionnaire contains 6 demographic ques-tions related to gender, age, urban or rural place of resi-dence, education, history and type of diabetes. The second part contains 19 questions segmented in 4 subgroups relat-ed to: Glucose Management, Dietary Control, Physical Ac-tivity and Health-Care Use. The rating scale was designed as a four-point Likert scale, in a range 3-0 points, from the response options \u201capplies to me very much\u201d (3 points) to \u2018does not apply to me\u2019 (0 points). 300 diabetes patients have been assessed with this questionnaire in 11 different towns in R. Macedonia: Skopje, Bitola, Strumica, Kumanovo, Kicevo, Tetovo, Prilep, Veles, Ohrid, Struga, and Stip. As-sessment has been performed in direct contact of pharma-cist with patient, with previously gained patient\u2019s consent for participation. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0.0. Group comparisons involved One-way Anal-ysis of Variance, Student\u2019s t-test and Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test. In all analyses a P-value of < 0.05 (two-tailed test) was considered as criterion of statistical significance.Results and discussion300 diabetes patients were assessed, most at age >51years and older, 60% female and 40% male. Most of the patients come from urban environment with second-ary education. 90% of the subjects have diabetes type 2 and a history of disease > 5 years. Regarding to our find-ings, diabetes patients from Republic of Macedonia most-ly pay attention in regards to glucose management and reg-ular treatment. In Dietary control questionnaire segment, most of the patients rated with 2 points (applies to me to a considerable degree). What is concerning is the low level of the perception for the need for physical activities and its impact on overall disease management.ConclusionThe preliminary results suggest on concerning low level of perception for self-management in diabetes pa-tients in R.

Cyril and Methodius, MajkaTereza 47, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* blazarova55@yahoo.comIntroductionAccording to WHO, rational use of medicines is de-fined as process that allows prescribing of the right drug for a right patient in the proper dose, duration of therapy, with the lowest cost for the patient and the community. World-wide, more than 50% of all medicines are prescribed, is-sued, or sold inappropriately. The most common reasons for the irrational drug use are: using too much medication per patient, improper use of antibiotics (inadequate intake for non-bacterial infection), use of the wrong medication for specific condition, drug use with questionable effec-tiveness, using a drug with uncertain security status, exces-sive use of parenteral formulations, where the use of oral formulations is more appropriate, inappropriate self-med-ication. Irrational drug use represents a major generator of progressively increasing costs in all health systems. (Hol-loway and Green, 2003).The aim of this study was to eval-uate rational/irrational drug use at orthopedic department - Clinical HospitalStip.Materials and methodsA retrospective evaluation for the period of 4 months concerning to consumption of analgesics (Tramadol and Ketoprofen), antibiotics (Ceftriaxon), unfractionated hep-arin and low molecular weight heparins was done. Total number of patients was 348 in evaluated period January - April 2013. The Evaluation of the therapy used in the study was according to the guidelines for evidence-based medicine issued by the Ministry of Health of RM for the treatment of diseases that are diagnosed in the test popula-tion.  For the diagnoses for which there is not recommend-ed guidelines, the European and American Associations for the treatment of given diseases guidelines were used. In order to detect discrepancies in the rational drug use for each of the evaluated drugs, DDD expressed per 100 hos-pital beds was calculated. The obtained data were statisti-cally analyzed using SPSS.v.20 software licensed program.Results and discussionIn Clinical hospital \u2013 Stip, annually expenditure for drugs is 500 000.00 euros and 7.1% belongs to the orthope-dic department. From 348 hospitalized patients on this de-partment in evaluated period, 218 patients (62.64%) were treated conservatively and 130 patients (37.36%) with sur-gery intervention. The average age of evaluated patients was 57.14 \u00b1 20.3 years and average time of hospitaliza-tion per patient was 7.74 \u00b1 10.4 days. In most of the hos-pitalized patients diagnose was bone fracture and almost all patients received more than 4 drugs as parenteral thera-py. The most commonly used analgesic for the pain control treatment was Amp. Ketoprofen. According to the obtained data in February, 51 out of 75 patients (68%) received Ke-toprofen of which 19 (38.59%) more than 5 days. In Feb-ruary 56.99 DDD/HHB Ketoprofen was used with extra costs of 27.35%. In March 66 patients (61%) received Ke-toprofen of which 17 (25.76%) more than 5 days. In April 41 patients (43.16%) received Ketoprofen of which 16 (39.02%) received more than 5 days. The DDD/HHB for S1 PP 50116Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 115 - 116 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsKetoprofen in April was 18.82. Ketoprofen was applied in almost all patients who were hospitalized at the orthopedic department at the Clinical Hospital Stip, much longer than recommendations of  5 days and parenteral form of the this drug was not replaced with an oral form.The same situation is evident for the application of Tramadol. From total 160 inpatients for four months peri-od who received Tramadol, 65 of them received more than 4 days. In January, 41 patients (58.57%) received Trama-dol of which 22 (53.66%) received Tramadol more than 4 days. The DDD/HHB in January was 11.35. In Febru-ary, 32 (42.67%) received Tramadol, 8 of which (25%) received more than 4 days. Relatively same situation we evaluated in March and April. Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is indi-cated in patients who performed more surgical interven-tion. Evidence-based medicine shows that the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT detected by routine venography af-ter larger orthopedic intervention is lower in hospitals that implement prophylaxis 10 days compared to hospitals that carry out prophylaxis only 5 days. This observation sup-ports the current recommendations of the American Col-lege of Chest Physicians (ACCP) for a minimum 7-10 days prophylaxis in patients who undergo surgery at or-thopedics. In January, total of 16 (22.86%) hospitalized pa-tients received thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and only 5 (31.25%) patients re-ceived prophylaxis in accordance with the recommenda-tions (\u22657days). The associated DDD/HHB value for this month was 20.07. In February, 3 patients (4%) received LMWH and only 1 (33.33%) received more than 7 days and the DDD/HHB was 1.52. In March 5 patients (4.63%) received LMWH with highest extra cost of 68.46 %. In April, 14 patients (14.74%) patients received LMWH 5 of which (35.71%) received more than 7 days. Low-Dose Un-fractionated Heparin (LDUH) is used at the department in accordance with recommendations for thromboprophylax-is prevention and treatment of thrombosis for several de-cades. In January, 22 patients (31.43%) received thrombo-prophylaxis with LDUH of which 15 (68.18%) patients re-ceived prophylaxis as it was recommended (\u22657days). In January utilization was 35.48 DDD/HHB with extra cost of 33.26%. In February, 32 patients (42.67%) received LDUH of which 15 (46.87%) received more than 7 days. In March, from 108 patients, 39 (36.11%) received LDUH of which 17 (43.59%) more than 7 days and the DDD/HHB value was 39.99. In April 34 (35.79%) received LDUH of which 23 (67.65%) received more than 7 days and DDD/HHB value was 34.95.Regarding to the use of antibiotics for prophylaxis in orthopedic patients we found that ceftriaxone was mostly used antibiotic values for DDD/HHB from 26.24 to 42.74 and in all evaluated period the period of using of this anti-biotic was more than 2 days.

The complexity of the manufacturing process of those drugs, the character of the active substance and the nature of their activity, demands a stringent regulatory framework for these medicines. Biosimilar medicines, according to the World Health Organization (which refers to them as \u201csimilar biotherapeutic products\u201d), are products which are manufactured following the expiration of the patents or the data protection for the first major group of the originator\u2019s biological products. There is a strong interest by health-care stakeholders in measuring the biosimilar utilization and impact on the market entry. Regulatory issues, manu-facturing, safety, pricing, and physician and patient accep-tance have a big influence in the developing the biosimi-lar market. With regulatory approval pathways encourag-ing more competition among manufacturers of biologics, there follows the prospect of increased litigation and other threats to intellectual property rights. Biosimilar patent lit-igation continues to evolve as biosimilars enter new glob-al markets. The European Union (EU) was the one of the first highly regulated areas to develop a legal and regulato-ry framework for the approval for highly similar versions of innovator biological products. Although formal approv-al pathway for biosimilar began in the EU very early in 2001 (European Medicines Agency, 2003), the European Commission (EC) first amended its market authorization forsimilar biological medicinal products in 2003 (Com-mission Directive 2003/63/EC, 2003), and issued its first general biosimilar guidance in 2005 (European Medicines Agency, 2005). The European Medicines Agency\u2019s (EMA) first approval under the new similar biological medicinal product pathway was in 2006 (Sandoz\u2019s somatropin called Omnitrope\u00ae) and since then 20 biosimilars are approved in EMA (European Medicines Agency list of approved bi-osimilars, 2016).While the EU\u2019s legal system is complicat-ed by the lack of a unified patent litigation system that re-quires a multicountry patent litigation approach, the US\u2019s biosimilar patent litigation has been complicated by bio-similar applicants and the reference biological product ap-plicants picking and choosing what portion of the default patent litigation exchange system to utilize. Despite the differences between the litigation strategies in the EU and the US, as biosimilar approvals become worldwide more globalized, and it will be increasingly important to appre-ciate these differences and consideration to how biosimi-lars patent litigation arguments and outcomes in one situa-tion can benefit and be utilized in other situation, even if in different countries or legal systems. Still there are some limitation on the patent issue of bi-osimilars like that the subject matter is not patentable, the invention was not explained clearly or completely enough or the subject matter extends beyond the content of the ap-plication filed. From the other side, there are also different possible outcomes such as rejection of patent, the patent is maintained in amended form with a new published specifi-cation, or the patent is revoked. Initial opposition decisions may be appealed within two months, and countries may have conflicting rules whether they stay or halt further le-gal process, national patent infringement actions while an opposition and any associated appeal is pending. The me-dian time for an appeal is close to three years, which is the same approximate median time for an opposition for pat-S1 PP 51118Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 117 - 118 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsents concerning pharmaceutical and biotechnology prod-ucts (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010).Concurrently or following an opposition, biosimilars pat-ent litigation may begin in member countries but still liti-gation in each county requires detailed knowledge of that country\u2019s national patent litigation procedures. Due to the differences in patent litigation rules and bi-osimilars regulatory applications, there may be advantag-es to bring an initial biosimilars patent litigation in the one primary biosimilar markets, the place of business or man-ufacture of the biosimilar, or based on a received jurisdic-tional favoring the action. Because each country has its own law system where patent holders may enforce their patents, there is the possibility for conflicting patent en-forcement decisions in different countries, where biosimi-lar manufacturers may pursue national patent litigations in member countries simultaneously or successively. There-fore there appears to be limited patent litigation challeng-es in the EU with a preference to patent issuance challeng-es and some limited country patent challenges. There are many unresolved issues that will affect European patent challenges, especially for bridging biosimilar products on the EU market.ReferencesCommission Directive 2003/63/EC, 2003.

NSAIDs have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, an-tipyretic or antireumatic action and differ in activity and severity of adverse effects. These drugs have more or less serious side effects affecting the most gastrointestinal tract. NSAIDs should not be prescribed to patients with gastric or duodenal ulcer, because their use may lead to bleeding and even to a lethal outcome. All NSAIDs can be structurally divided into several groups: derivatives of salicylic acid, p-aminophenol deriv-atives, propionic acid derivatives, indole derivatives, phen-ylacetic acid derivatives, oxicams, and fenamates naftilac-etatne acid derivatives. NSAIDs are indicated in different treatments because of their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic and antirheumatic effects. The NSAID anti-in-flammatory action is due to inhibitory activity on prosta-glandin G/H synthase (cyclooxygenase). This enzyme cat-alyzes the transformation of arachidonic acid to prosta-glandins and thromboxanes. There are two forms of this enzyme: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 enzyme is normal-ly present in the body, whiles the inducible COX-2 enzyme (cytokines, fibroblasts, epithelial cells) occurs only in in-flammatory conditions. Both enzymes have very similar structure (COX-1 consists of 599 amino acids, a COX-2 of 604) (Varagi\u0107 and Milo\u0161evi\u0107, 1991).The analgesic effect NSAIDs is achieved by reduc-ing peripheral sensitization of polymodal nocireptor, while antipyretic effect is achieved by inhibition of prostaglan-din E2. This prostaglandin is responsible for the activation of a special section in the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature in the formation of an inflammatory con-dition. General side effects of NSAIDs are associated di-rectly or indirectly with the irritation of the digestive sys-tem. NSAIDs have a twofold effect on the digestive sys-tem: acid molecules directly irritate the lining of the stom-ach, and the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 reduces the levels of protective prostaglandins.Common side effects on the digestive system include, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, stomach ulcer/bleeding in the stomach, diarrhea. Higher doses treatment is associated with increased risk of ulceration. In efforts to reduce the adverse effects on the digestive system, it is recommend-ed to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period, which is not the case in practice (Walker and Ed-wards, 1998).Materials and methodsIn this study, data were collected at the pharmacy, where we monitored quantity of prescription for NSAIDs, and the utilization of these drugs issued at the request of the patient (without a prescription). Evaluation lasted one month and twenty days, in which we monitored the amount of received recipes and amount of patients who take this medication without consulting doctor or pharmacist. Also we asked doctor how many patients come and ask for a prescription for NSAIDs and how they used them.Results and discussionOn average 200 patients come in the pharmacy and 130 out of them were looking for drugs that are used as S1 PP 52120Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 119 - 120 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsanalgesics or antipyretics, whereas approximately 90 pa-tients used some NSAIDs. Only 15 out of 90 patients have a prescription for the drug. Patients were not familiar with the problems that are linked to use of this type of medica-tion. According to results obtained from doctors approx-imately 85% of patients who use NSAIDs do not have a doctor\u2019s prescription. Patients used these drugs mainly for treatment of pain, and they chose them because are easi-ly available. ConclusionNSAID medicines are of great importance and one of the most commonly used medicines in hospitals and out-patient conditions. They are relatively safe drugs but their complications sometimes can be severe and fatal. Patients with current ulcer disease are more eligible for treatment with proton pump inhibitors in therapeutic dose, while pa-tients without current ulcer with a history of previous ill-ness of bleeding for treatment with dose of maintenance. The use of selective COX-2 inhibitors is justified for pa-tients at risk for gastrointestinal complications with previ-ous consultation with doctor or pharmacist.ReferencesVaragi\u0107, V.V, Milo\u0161evi\u0107, M.P., 1991.

Are medicines any safer now?Kevin O\u2018Donnell Health Products Regulatory Authority, Kevin O\u2019Malley House, Earlsfort Centre, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, Ireland* kevin.odonnell@hpra.ieBackground - ten years of QRM developmentsOver the past ten years, since the finalisation of the ICH guideline titled Quality Risk Management, ICH Q9, there have been significant efforts by industry and regula-tors to drive risk-based approaches forward.  This has in-cluded initiatives by regulators to update the GMPs and other official guidance documents to incorporate increased provisions relating to risk and its management (Campbell et al., 2016; European Commission, 2010; O\u2019Donnell et al., 2012). There have also been many industry-led pub-lications, guides and technical reports, offering practical guidance for how to implement the concepts of QRM in the GMP environment (Calnan et al., 2013; Vesper et al., 2006).However, the question remains as to whether the man-agement of risk in relation to the production of defective and sub-standard medicines has significantly improved in these last ten years, and whether, from a product quality perspective, medicines are any safer now than they were before the ICH Q9 guideline was introduced.  While there are many different areas one could study when consider-ing the question of medicines safety, such as pharmaco-vigilance, Marketing Authorisation withdrawals and drug shortages, to name but a few, the focus of this presenta-tion is on GMP, and specifically on product quality con-siderations.Looking for the added value for patientsThe presentation discusses how, while the aforemen-tioned QRM initiatives had product quality and patient safety as their overall focus, many of the product quality and compliance issues occurring before 2005 are still with us, and the evidence indicates that certain types of prob-lems are increasing (Waldron et al., 2015).  Some of these relate to:\u2022 Serious quality defects and product recalls continuing to occur globally;\u2022 Market Authorisation non-compliance issues some-times resulting in the cessation of batch release;\u2022 Product shortages as a result of serious GMP failures.QRM and risk assessment inspection deficienciesIn relation to serious quality defect issues, the presen-tation explores that various factors that may have led to the level of those issues seen in the last ten years - and how formal research projects are currently underway in Ireland and at the European Medicines Agency to better understand this area.  Of concern is the fact that most of these defective batches were manufactured using qualified equipment, trained staff, and validated manufacturing pro-cesses, and this leads one to question what is happening. The paper considers:\u2022 Whether the manufacturing and control processes cur-rently in place have been properly risk assessed and de-signed using QRM principles.  \u2022 Whether qualification and validation activities were ac-tually based on risk, as required by Annex 15 of the EU GMPs.  If so, why are defective batches of medicines still being produced, with the same kind of defects over and over \u2013 product contamination, mix-ups, labelling errors, etc.? \u2022 What areas need most attention in the QRM activities at manufacturing sites?

These relate to the lack of good sci-ence, robustness and rigour in many of risk assessment and QRM-related activities taking place currently.  The presen-tation presents a series of brief real-life case study exam-ples showing some of the inspectional deficiencies that the HPRA has cited in recent years in these areas, and it also presents a number of suggestions and ideas for how to im-prove QRM activities in the GMP environment.

As a key person in the company, the Qualified Person has to consider many issues and has to take up the challenges within its areas of responsibilities. The previous year 2015 was an eventful year. Again there were new developments in the Good Manufacturing Practice environment as well as announcements of changes that preoccupied the phar-maceutical industry. 2016 won\u2019t be less exciting, also be-cause now many of the new requirements must be imple-mented:\u2022\t Excipients - Formalized Risk Assessment, EMA Guideline, \u201c\u2026 on the formalized risk assessment for ascertaining the appropriate good manufac-turing practice for excipients of medicinal prod-ucts for human use\u201d, In operation from 21.

A comprehensively designed Pharmaceutical Quali-ty System (PQS) incorporating Good Manufacturing Prac-tice (GMP) and Quality Risk Management (QRM), imple-mented, maintained and continuously improved, allows a consistent delivery of products with appropriate quality at-tributes. The level of GMP, is regularly checked by com-petent authorities, authorized with a GMP Certificate, and it is a basis for maintenance of Marketing Authorization (MA) and marketing of medicinal products within the EC/EEA (CE, 2001; CE, 2003).       The results of product and processes monitoring are taken into account during batch certification, having into consideration deviations or OOS, OOT or OOE (if any) by implementing QRM. (EudraLex, 2016; ICH, 2005).  The Qualified Person is responsible for ensuring that each individual batch has been manufactured and checked in compliance with laws in force, in accordance with the requirements of the marketing authorisation (MA) and with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) (CE, 2001; Eu-draLex, 2016).When the batch is intended to be sold in the EU, in the new annex is clear on this: \u201cSamples may either be tak-en after arrival in the EU, or be taken at the manufactur-ing site in the third country in accordance with a technical-S2 OP 54126Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 125 - 126 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationsly justified approach which is documented within the com-pany\u2019s quality system. Any samples taken outside the EU should be shipped under equivalent transport conditions as the batch that they represent (EudraLex, 2016).Marketing authorizations require a QP declaration (issued by the Qualified Person) to confirm that the ac-tive substance (active pharmaceutical ingredient - API) has been manufactured in accordance with the EU-GMP Guide, Part II: Basic Requirements for Active Substanc-es used as Starting Materials. The QP declaration template provides, in a format considered suitable for submission, a basis for demonstrating compliance of the active substance manufacture with GMP requirements, based on audit on site(s) and that the manufacturer has relevant knowledge of the supply chain (EMA, 2014).  Relying on assessment by third parties, e.g. audits, should be in accordance with Chapter 7 of the GMP Guide in order to appropriately define, agree and control any out-sourced activity. Special focus should be given to the ap-proval of the audit reports (CE, 2003).   A signed Quality or Technical Agreement(s) between all parties involved in the supply chain, have to be in place, including manufacturers of the starting materials, in bulk and finished products manufacturers, batch control test-ing laboratories, importation and batch certification and release site(s), transportation and distribution. The entire supply chain of the active substance and medicinal product up to the stage of certification is documented and available for the QP. This should include the manufacturing sites of the starting materials and packaging materials for the me-dicinal product and any other materials deemed critical through a risk assessment of the manufacturing process. The document should preferably be in the format of a com-prehensive diagram, where each party, including subcon-tractors of critical steps are included (CE, 2003, EudraL-ex, 2016).

Courtaboeuf, 91970 Les Ulis, France* gregory.lecornet@agilent.comIntroductionThe presence of impurities in pharmaceutical samples is a concern, not only because some contaminants are inherently toxic, but also because they may adversely affect drug stability and shelf-life, or may cause unwanted side-effects. As a result, inorganic elemental impurities (As, Pb, Cd, Hg,\u2026) must be monitored and controlled in raw materials, including: water, used for drug manufacturing; intermediates; active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs); excipients and in the final dosage form. ICH, which includes the regulatory bodies from the US, Europe and Japan, as well as representatives from other countries and the pharmaceutical industry, has defined a Guideline for Elemental Impurities (Q3D) due to be implemented in December 2017 (Liba et al., 2011).The new methods will introduce the use of closed vessel sample digestion and modern instrumental techniques (ICP-AES, ICP-MS) to ensure the accurate recovery and determination of individual analyte (McCurdy et al., 2004)Material and methodsAn Agilent 7800 ICP-MS with Octopole Reaction System (ORS4) fitted with a low-flow concentric quartz nebulizer was used for all measurements. The objective was to use the ICP-MS to determine a full range of elements. The ORS4 was operated in helium collision mode (He mode) only, which is effective at removing a wide range of plasma and matrix-based polyatomic species using kinetic energy discrimination (KED). Because He mode does not react with any analyte, and does not create any new interferences, elements that do not suffer from polyatomic interferences were also analyzed using He modeReagents and materialsHNO3 (BASF); ultrapure water (18.2 M\u03a9) produced by Milli-Q ultrapure water systems; 100 g/mL of multi element internal standard solution containing 6Li, Sc, Ge, Rh, In, Tb, Lu and Bi (Agilent Part # 5188-6525); multi-element calibration standard STD-2A solution (Agilent Part # 8500-6940)Results and discussionIn this study, we investigated the use of collision cell technology using helium gas to eliminate interferences generated by the plasma and the sample matrix. Typical matrix-derived polyatomic interference ions arising from the analysis of gelatin capsules include 40Ar12C+, 51V1H, 35Cl16O1H and 40Ca12C, etc. on 52Cr and 40Ar13C, 37Cl16O and doubly-charged 106Ru++ on 53Cr. The total dissolved solids (TDS) of the samples were less than 0.2% and any matrix effects were eliminated via the use of the internal standard calibration method.ConclusionOperating the Agilent 7700x with ORS3 in helium mode effectively removes polyatomic interferences via kinetic energy discrimination allowing the rapid, accurate, semi-quantitative screening of complex sample types, such as gelatin capsules. For each sample, semi-quantitative and full quantitative analysis can be performed simultaneously without the need to adjust the instrument.S2 OP 55128Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 127 - 128(2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationsReferencesLiba A., McCurdy E., 2011.

This herb is mostly produced for domestic or re-gional markets and its production in Europe is believed to be increasing in indoor settings, under the control of orga-nized crime groups. Usually, the authorities are faced with the problem of a lack of information on where the canna-bis was grown. This material is also widely consumed by the population in each country and therefore establishing of system for classifying the origin of this plant can be a challenge for the scientists and a great benefit for the po-lice authorities. When drugs are concerned and especially for the fo-rensic purposes, the most significant compounds in Canna-bis samples are cannabinoids, terpenophenolic compounds unique to cannabis. For the forensic practice, the most im-portant cannabinoids are: \u22069-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u22069-THC), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabidiol (CBD). The first compound, \u22069-THC is psychoactive component, while the other two mentioned cannabinoids are not. On the other, hand, transition metals are important for plant growth and they are distributed in different cells, in certain concen-trations due to the established homeostasis. Hemp has the ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals. Bearing in mind the lack of literature on possible correlations between content of cannabinoids in Cannabis plants and metals in both Cannabis samples and soil where the plants were cul-tivated, multivariate methods were applied aiming to assist in determination of origin of cannabis and its production. Materials and methodsYoung plants of Cannabis sativa species had been seized by the Police authorities as material planted by the criminal groups on different locations in Serbia. The plants were grown illegally under controlled indoor conditions by applying certain levels of temperature, humidity and inten-sity of light. The plants were randomly selected from the plantations in the early growing stage for the purpose of fo-rensic analyses. The rhizosphere soil from the root zone at a depth of 5-10 cm was sampled. The plant samples were further separated into roots, stems and leaves. The roots parts were cleaned from traces of soil, washed with de-ionised water and dried. The Cannabis leaves were dried and grounded to a powder. The mass of 33.3 mg of dried leaves material was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol, shak-en in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and filtered. The fil-trate was heated for 12 min at 150 \u00b0\u0421 in order to run decar-boxylation of the cannabinoid acids into cannabinoids. The evaporated extracts were reconstituted with 2 mL of meth-anol.  The resulting solution of 1 \u00b5L, for each sample was applied on the TLC plate together with the volume of 1 \u00b5L of the dissolved reference materials:  \u03949-THC, CBN and CBD in methanol in concentration of 0.05 mg/mL and 1 \u00b5L of pure methanol. Mobile phase was n-hexane: diethyl ether in ratio 4 : 1. Visualization was conducted by the dis-solved Azoic Diazo Component in 0.1 M sodium hydrox-ide in water. In the second step, 20 mg of each sample were dis-solved in 5 mL methanol, shaken in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue was reconstituted with 2 mL of methanol. 1 \u00b5L of the re-sulting solution for each sample was injected into the GC-FID system in order to analyse the content of cannabinoids. S2 OP 56130Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 129 - 130 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationsFor the purpose of elemental analysis, the sampled soils, roots, stems and leaves were subjected to microwave-as-sisted acid digestion, according to a known procedure (Ra-zic et al., 2006). The determination of the cannabinoids by thin lay-er chromatography (TLC) with plates made of aluminium and covered with silica gel with fluorescence indicator of UV254, by conducting the semi quantitative analyses.The determination of the cannabinoids was performed using an Agilent GC System, Model 7890A, fitted with a Flame Ionization Detector. The conditions were as fol-lows: column HP-5 (30 m \u00d7 320 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m), injection temperature: 250 \u00b0C, splitless mode, oven program: initial temperature 150 \u00b0C for 0 min, heating rate 15 \u00b0C/min to 300 \u00b0C and held for 5 min, nitrogen flow rate: 46 mL/min. The determination of the Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ca and Mg was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer Model 5000 atomic ab-sorption spectrophotometer, operated under optimized measurement (Razic et al., 2005).  The determination of the Cr was accomplished using a Perkin-Elmer Model 5000 atomic absorption spectrophotometer with a graph-ite furnace HGA 400 Automatic Burner Control (Razic et al., 2006).Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and Minitab 13.20 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA), for Windows software packages. Results and discussionSince the roots contain only trace amounts of these sub-stances while the stems, branches and twigs have less than the leaf material, the cannabinoid content was measured only in the leaves. For the purpose of comparison of the can-nabinoid content in the young plants and the mature one the semi quantitative method of the TLC was conducted and the difference in the cannabinoids content was detected. The cannabinoids content in the leaves of the exam-ined cannabis plants was determined by external calibra-tion. The values varied from 0.03 to 1.47 mg/mL for THC and from 0.11 to 1.12 mg/mL for CBN. The lowest lev-els were from 0.003 to 0.06 mg/mL for CBN, what is rea-sonable since the level of this cannabinoid, as degradation product of THC, increases with time during storage of can-nabis plants. Quantification of metals was performed by external cal-ibration. The accuracy of the methods was checked by anal-ysis of a standard reference material, NIST SRM 1547 \u2013 Peach Leaves and NIST SRM 2711 - Montana II Soil, when satisfactory recoveries (90.06 - 115.35%) were obtained.The objective of this study was to analyse the corre-lations of seven metals and three main cannabinoids us-ing multivariate methods of analysis. After preliminary tests (Ryan-Joiner and Grubbs tests) the concentration data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) in order to highlight any relations between the elements. Four principal components (PCs) appeared to account for 89.42% of the variance of the data. These factors are re-lated to the sources of the elements and cannabinoids in the studied samples. The first factor comprises Mn, THC and CBN with high loadings. A correlation like this indi-cates that they arise from the same sources. Fe and Cr show significant positive loadings in the second factor and are negatively correlated with Zn and CBD with high nega-tive loading. The third factor is dominantly loaded by Cu as an essential element; a constituent of co-enzymes im-portant for a plant cycle. It is also correlated with Mg, with a high but negative loading. These correlations led to the consideration of the biosynthesis of cannabinoids and the involvement of metals as cofactors in the enzymatic cata-lyzed synthesis cycles (De Meijer et al., 2002; Pate, 1994; Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al., 2014; Sirikantaramas et al., 2005; Taura et al., 2007).ConclusionThis work is conducted in order to determine whether the metals content in rhizosphere and cannabis can affect the levels of three important cannabinoids. The obtained results were subjected to chemometrics evaluation which gave an opportunity to get a better insight into role of met-als in the biosynthesis of cannabinoids. Identified patterns could be helpful in tracking the origin of Cannabis plant and its product adding a value to the applied analytical and chemometrics methods in forensic sciences.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* jelena@ff.ukim.edu.mkBackground Falsification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) has been recognized as an important health issue since a series of health scares involving large numbers of casualties happened when altered APIs escaped detection in routine analytical testing (D\u00e9gardin et al., 2014). API falsification usually means discrepancy between the information for declared manufacturer and the actual manufacturer of the APIs used for manufacturing of fin-ished dosage forms (FDF). Any form of tampering the con-tent or information about the content might affect the qual-ity of an API and therefore constitutes a direct threat to the health of patients. Since the reason for any falsification is fast and easy money, there is no general rule what APIs can be subjected to falsification. For any substance that can bring economic benefits to the manufacturer / distributor there is a potential risk to be falsified. The conventional analytical approach often fails to de-tect falsification since the quality and quantity of the API is within the standards. Instead, methods that allow for dis-tinguishing API samples and determining the source of APIs suspected for falsification are needed. Alternative ap-proach must include broader analytical window using spe-cific techniques to reveal some characteristic analytical in-formation, such as impurity profile, spectral data, physico-chemical constants, etc., thus creating an \u2018API fingerprint\u2019 database. APIs can be characterized, compared and clas-sified based on features revealed from such \u2018fingerprints\u2019, using chemometric methods, like different pattern recog-nition techniques (PRT) (Acevska et al., 2015; Petrusevs-ki et al., 2015).The aim of this research was to give an overview of analytical and chemometric methods used to differentiate the origin of the samples based on a \u2018fingerprint\u2019 database by the discriminatory matching of specific analytical fea-tures of the specific API.API fingerprinting API fingerprinting is the common name of a group of analytical applications for detection, identification and quantitative determination of related substances and oth-er impurities. Impurity profiling (organic, inorganic im-purities, residual solvents, enantiomeric purity), chemi-cal characterization (polymorphism/solvatomorphism) and other contaminants (radioactivity) of the APIs requires ad-vanced and robust fingerprint method. It usually comprise a set of several highly specific techniques, like: liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer (LC/MS, GC/MS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), & differential termogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG), Furrier-transformed infrared (FTIR), near infrared (NIR), Raman or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR); in-ductively coupled plasma combined with optical emission (ICP-OES) or mass spectrometry (ICP/MS), X-ray diffrac-tion (XRD) etc. The characteristic and reproducible chemi-cal features revealed during the API fingerprinting are used for discriminating between samples. This data highlights the API fingerprinting as core activity in modern drug anal-ysis and tool for getting reliable results for combating API falsification. Pattern recognition of API fingerprintsPattern recognition techniques that can be applied to API fingerprinting consist of two general areas; unsuper-vised or supervised. From the characterization of the sam-ples of known origin, predictive models can be built and S2 OP 57132Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 131 - 132 (2016)Oral presentationsPharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairstested with new samples of unknown composition. By de-termination of different origins of the APIs, their falsifica-tion can be detected.In unsupervised pattern recognition (hierarchical clus-ter analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), generally viewed as exploratory data analysis methods, from which natural clusters in the data set can be identi-fied, no knowledge concerning the origin of the samples is necessary. HCA gives no indication of the variables which contribute most to the classification of objects in the data set, unlike PCA, where the loadings indicate the variation contained within each variable. There may be a loss of in-formation in the dendrogram generated by HCA, especial-ly if clusters are not well resolved. However, HCA does present all the variation in the data set, in contrast to PCA where only a percentage of the variation is typically pre-sented (Adams, 2004).In supervised pattern recognition (classification and discriminant analysis (CDA), orthogonal partial least square regression (OPLS/O2PLS), soft independent mod-eling of class analogy (SIMCA), etc.), the groupings of samples must be known to allow predictions to take place. These methods require prior knowledge of the sample ori-gin to develop models, which are subsequently used to as-sign unknown samples to a parent group. The OPLS-DA method is well suited for classification of data that have multi-collinear and noisy variables, which is common for many types of chemical data. Refined properties of the OPLS-DA methodology have illustrated how Y-orthogo-nal variation can be useful not only for evaluation, but also for classification, thus rendering a PLS-DA/SIMCA hybrid discriminatory model (Bylesjo et al., 2006).Validation of the classification method The outcome of the investigation on API falsification should be accurate and reliable. For sample authentica-tion purposes, it is essential to ensure that their affiliation is properly defined (Gonzalez, 2007). In other words, de-tection of false negatives (excluding sample that belongs to the class) and false positive (includes a sample that does not belong to the class) results must be enabled. Ultimate-ly a method should be found for which there are no false negatives at the cost of several more false positives. For il-lustration, obtaining a false positive result during the API fingerprinting, means further more detailed analytical test-ing of the substance suspected to be falsified. But the risk of obtaining a false negative result must be completely re-moved, as it is unacceptable to pass a falsified API to mar-ket. Perspective There are several milestones (sampling, choice of an-alytical and statistical methods, and dissemination of re-sults) that need to be challenged. Sampling is mainly based on a goodwill of the manu-facturers/MAHs; the regulatory frame need to be strength-en for sampling can be possible on each step where tam-pering of substance or information of its origin might oc-cur (manufacturing site, distribution, brokers if any, FDF manufacturer, APIs used for preparations in pharmacies).Number of samples is often insufficient for robust sta-tistical evaluation of results; wider involvement of OMCLs and regulatory authorities (including customs and police) is expected for more efficient sampling process.Manufacturer\u2019s specification is not sufficient for API fingerprinting; an overall strategy against falsification in-cluding wide analytical window in combination with PRT should be implemented by competent authorities. Dissemination of the results is sometimes burdened by intellectual or industrial property issues and therefore sometimes is only used by API manufacturer for protection from competition; in order for results to be used for better control of the APIs used for the medicines available on the market, proper agreement between industry and competent authorities should be in place.

No single definition for an orphan disease exists worldwide, but it is generally a disease that affects a small portion of the population. Today, there are more than 6,000 to 7,000 known rare diseases, 80 percent of which have been identified as genetic in nature, with incidence of less than one in 2,000 people. Symptoms of some rare diseases may appear at birth or develop later in childhood or even during adult life. Other rare diseases are a result of infection (bacterial or viral), allergies or are caused by degenerative and proliferative conditions (Orphaned, 2012). Currently, the number of rare diseases for which there is no available treatment is estimated to be around 4,000 - 5,000 worldwide (Morin et al., 2013). The objective of this paper is to compare the regulation for orphan drugs defined by Food and Drug Agency (FDA) and European Medical Agency (EMA), in the United States and EU, respectively. These two regulatory agencies stimulate processes of a parallel application for orphan designation appropriate, when dealing with potential orphan drugs.FDA regulations for orphan drugsThe first regulation for orphan drugs in USA was introduced in 1983. According to the FDA guidelines, orphan drug is a drug that is intended for treatment of disease or condition which affects less than 200,000 people in the USA or more than 200,000 in case when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available this drug in the USA will be recovered from it sales (Morin et al., 2013). Today, in USA there are three laws that apply to orphan drugs, as follows:1. Orphan Drug Act (first regulation for orphan drugs) - legal act which aims to protect every orphan drug, produced and placed on the market in the USA by the pharmaceutical company, domestic or international. This regulation assumes that the drugs intended to treatment of rare diseases need patent protection, because basically this class of drugs is characterized by lower return of invested funds (Abramowicz, 2010).2. Protection from generic competition - reference this legislation, when one drug is designated as \u201corphan\u201d drug, FDA cannot give designation to a generic drug for the period of five to seven years. The main purpose of this legislation is to discourage the idea of development of non-patented drugs. This legislation allows better protection from generic competitors than the Orphan Drug Act, and the same applies for drugs intended for treatment of diseases that affect more than 200,000 people but the costs of research and development will not be cover by their projected sales (Abramowicz, 2010).3. Hatch-Waxman Act is regulation for stimulating the generic competition. Under this act, a generic drug company that challenges the pioneer drug with patent protecting receives 180 days exclusivity period, meaning that no other generic drug manufacturer can enter the market during that time. The main goal is to accelerate the generic competition. The authorized generic manufacturer can charge considerably above marginal cost, allowing it to earn a profit and providing it an incentive to challenge pioneer patents (Abramowicz, 2010).According to the FDA regulation, orphan drugs have market exclusivity for period of five to seven years, shortened procedure of registration; the company owner of orphan designation receives a tax incentives, protocol assistance as well as exemption from payment of certain fees (Morin et al., 2013).S2 OP 58134Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 133 - 134 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationsEMA regulations for orphan drugsThe regulation for orphan drugs in EU legislation was first time adopted in 1999. According to EMA rules, orphan drug is designated drug which is intended for treatment of rare disease or condition which affects not more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU. Most of these people suffer from diseases affecting less than 1 in 100,000 people (EMA, 2015). At the European Union granting of orphan designation can be made only by the European Commission. The application is evaluated by the EMA\u2019s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), which provides its opinion on whether or not the medicine qualifies as orphan medicines for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a rare disease. If the COMP issues a positive opinion, the European Commission may then grant the medicine orphan status (EMA, 2015). Rules for obtaining the orphan designation at EMA are defined by six regulations and two additional guidelines (EMA, Legal background). To qualify for orphan designation, a medicine must meet a number of criteria: it must be indicated for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating, the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for development or there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized or if such a method exists, the new medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Drugs that meet the EMA\u2019s requirements for orphan designation received protocol assistance, access to centralized approval procedure for marketing authorization, a period of ten years market exclusivity in the EU with the possibility of additional two years market exclusivity for drugs that have valid and approved pediatric research plan (pediatric investigation plan). Additionally, all drugs with orphan designation by EMA received further compensate for micro, small and medium-sized companies, reduction of costs, grants and national compensate in the EU Member States (EMA, Activities after orphan designation).Instead of conclusionThe comparative review of FDA / EMA regulations showed that FDA and EMA permit shortened registration procedure and both regulatory agencies allow exemption from payment of certain fees and provide protocol assistance. There are three main differences between FDA and EMA. The first difference is period of market exclusivity, noted that the period of market exclusivity in the USA could be from five to maximum seven years, apart from EU where market exclusivity for drugs with orphan designation is ten years, with additional two years for orphan drugs with valid and approved pediatric research plan. The second difference is in terms of tax incentives and exemptions, which are currently permitted in general in the all the USA countries by the FDA, as opposed to the EU, where EMA gives general tax incentives and exemptions, but each EU Member State has the possibility to provide additional national exemptions and incentives for some orphan drugs. And the third difference exists in terms of grants. In the USA they\u2019re getting from the part of the FDA Orphan products grants program. Unlike the FDA, EMA does not offer any additional grants from its budget for research and development of new orphan drugs. However EMA makes funds available through the European Commission such as Horizon 2020, The EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation E-Rare, a transnational project for research programmes on rare diseases International Rare Diseases Consortium (IRDIRC).ReferencesAbramowicz, M., 2010.

It is therefore essential to develop adequate cleaning procedures, in order to avoid cross contamination. Pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) can be contaminated by other pharmaceutical products, by cleaning agents, micro-organisms or by other material (i.e. airborne particles, dust, raw materials, products of degradation (EudraLex, 2014).The cleaning validation is a very complex task, and the implementation requires a carefully elaborated plan. The Cleaning Validation Master Plan is a basic document ac-cording to which the validation is performed. It presents an overview of the scope of the project, establishes essen-tial requirements, such as acceptance criteria, sampling pro-cedures, methods of analysis and is used as a planning and monitoring instrument (EudraLex, 2015). Establishing a cleaning validation programWritten cleaning procedures must be established for all equipment parts and surface which come into contact with the medicinal product. Responsible stuff has to be trained on the cleaning procedures. The critical parameters of the cleaning procedures can be determined by the risk-analy-sis. The risk-analysis should evaluate the influence of the product, equipment and process specific parameters on the cleaning objective (Hiob and Gomez, 2011).Important phase during effective planning of clean-ing validation study is selection of the worst-case prod-uct, manufactured in each equipment line. To assure effec-tiveness under worst-case conditions, the worst case must be defined in more exact terms. The first thing to be deter-mined is whether all the products made using the equip-ment, can be cleaned according the same procedure, or sev-eral cleaning procedures are required due to different prod-uct properties. Within each group of products, for which an individual cleaning procedure is required, the product which is the most difficult to clean represents the worst case. If the cleaning procedure is designed in such a way that this product can be cleaned in a reliable manner, the ef-fectiveness of the cleaning procedure is assured for all other products which are easier to clean and are in the same group as well (Haider and Asif,  2010a).In the selection of worst-case product, the solubility of the ingredients, the tendency of the product towards crust formation and where relevant, residues left by colored in-gredients should be reviewed as being critical factors to the success of the cleaning. The pharmacological characteris-tics and toxicity data of drugs have a significant impact on the selection of worst-case product also. During the optimization phase the following informa-tion must be defined: maximum hold time for uncleaned equipment and clean hold time.Analytical testing and reporting phaseDirty hold time is defined as the time between the end of manufacturing process of the product batch and the be-ginning of the cleaning process. Clean hold time is the time between the completion of cleaning of the equipment and the initiation of the subsequent manufacturing operation, if in the production area the conditions are appropriate.S2 OP 59136Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 135 - 136 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationsAcceptance criteria must be defined before the valida-tion begins. A limit is an actual numerical value and is one of the requirements of the acceptance criteria of a clean-ing validation protocol.  Compliance with limits can be as-sured by direct (swab test) or indirect sampling (rinse test). Sampling (by swab) should be performed from the criti-cal areas of the production equipment. These critical areas of the production equipment are usually difficult to access during cleaning and/or are very difficult to see during the final checks. These areas, as well as dirty and clean hold times, should be included in the cleaning Standard Opera-tional Procedures (FDA, 2011).   Maximum Allowable Carryover (MACO) - maximum quantity of acceptable transferred residue from the active substance of the previous product is calculated by thera-peutic dose criteria or by permitted daily exposure criteria.The quantitative determination of residues of the sub-stances, cleaning agent and microbiological contamination that should be carried out after sampling, will require val-idated analytical methods with sufficient specificity and sensitivity to be able to detect the results at or below the established acceptance limits.Validation of analytical methods are carried out on the parameters: Limit of Detection (LOD), Limit of Quantifi-cation (LOQ), Specificity, Selectivity, Recovery, Precision, Range and Linearity (Borchert and Gomez, 2011a).   Validation of the cleaning procedure should be per-formed analytically after the approval of visual inspection (absence of stains or any materiel residue). Selecting a method to detect cleaning agent be per-formed analytically after the approval of visual inspec-tion (absence of stains or any materiel residue).overyraphy (HPLC), ion selective electrodes, flame photometry, deriv-ative Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy, Thin Layer Chroma-tography, enzymatic detection, and titration. It can also involve non-specific methods that detect the presence of a blend of ingredients such as: TOC, pH, and conductivity. The regulators prefer specific methods, but will accept non-specific methods with adequate rationales for their use. For investigations of failures or action levels, a specific method is usually preferable.For the swab sampling method it is necessary to deter-mine: the percent recovered with the swab extraction pro-cedure; the effectiveness of the swab at recovering residues from equipment parts surface and the interference of swab materials in the analysis.For the rinse sampling method it is necessary to deter-mine: the percent recovered with the rinse solution extrac-tion procedure; the effectiveness of the rinse solution at re-covering residues from equipment parts surfaces and the interference of the rinse solution in the cleaning procedure and analysis; a correction for recovery efficiency in calcu-lations for acceptable residue levels.The percentage of recovery is important because it will be applied when evaluating the final concentration of residuals.All equipment that comes in contact directly with raw ma-terial -intermediate as well as final product - must be included, because of its potential to act as a possible source for microbi-ological contamination. The microbial testing is performed on the selected surface of the equipment in order to determine the number of colony forming units (CFUs) present. Analysts from Quality Control Department will per-form the analysis on the swab and/or rinse samples. The results are reported in Quality Assurance Department and the Quality Assurance Manager will give final approval to the reviewed results by signing the final Report (Haider and Asif, 2010b). Validated cleaning process must be subject to change control. Further, revalidation is necessary in order to main-tain the validated status where a differentiation must be made between change-related and periodic revalidation. An effi-cient change control procedure must ensure that the effect of changes on the cleaning validation is identified and that any necessary follow-up action is initiated. Checks must be car-ried-out to verify whether revalidation is necessary follow-ing changes to the cleaning procedure, production equipment and products. A suitable time interval must be determined for the periodic revalidation. Implementation may be stream-lined by linking this to the change control procedure and by reducing the scope of the validation based on a review of data and documents (Borchert and Gomez, 2011b).ConclusionCleaning procedures should be suitable for their in-tended purpose. This should be confirmed by the success-ful execution of a cleaning validation study. The clean-ing validation must ensure that the quality of the product produced using specified equipment is not influenced by cross-contamination from the previous product, cleaning agent\u2019s residues or microorganisms.ReferencesBorchert, D., Gomez, R., 2011a.

D., Blvd. A. Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* anosacheva@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionMost people nowadays suffer from problems with the gastrointestinal tract and indigestion. Gastroguard chew-able tablets are a pharmaceutical solid dosage form from the group of antacids, which contains 680 mg calcium car-bonate and 80 mg magnesium carbonate. Its effect is to act locally and neutralize the gastric acid in the stomach, not depending on the systemic absorption. Therefore it al-leviates the symptoms caused by indigestion and releases the feeling of bloating. The carbonate salts react with the gastric acid in the stomach developing water and miner-al salts as products (http://www.alkaloid.com.mk/vademe-cum-step-2.nspx?LekTipId=150). Every pharmaceutical product must be subjected to chemical and microbiological analysis before the batch release. Those analyses are under the jurisdiction of the Quality Control department. In addition to the microbio-logical analysis a working method for determination of the microbiological purity in this pharmaceutical solid form, which would be used in the routine, must be validated. For pharmaceutical solid forms the parameters that should be tested are Total Aerobic Microbial Count (TAMC), Total Yeasts and Molds Count (TYMC) and absence of Esche-richia coli (Ph.Eur., 2013; USP, 2014).The aim of this work is to validate the analytical meth-od which would be used in the routine work for determina-tion of the microbiological purity of Gastoguard chewable tablets as part of the quality control of the product before releasing of the batch. The method should be simple for manipulation and in compliance with the current Europe-an Pharmacopeia. The validation of the method was made by the microbiological team of the Quality Control depart-ment of Alkaloid AD.Materials and methodMaterialsDuring validation of the method standard laborato-ry equipment was used: Laminar flow Class II, Incubators Gallencamp on 20-25 \u00baC; 30-35 \u00baC and 42-44 \u00baC, Bunsen burner, Vortex, glass pipetes, glass tubes intended for mi-crobiological use. In addition to validate the method 10g of Gastoguard chewable tablets were weighted using Sartori-us analytical scale. Buffered sodium chloride peptone wa-ter pH 7 was utilized as medium for dissolving of the sam-ple and for making the dilutions of the culture suspensions. Ready to use nutrient media from BioM\u00e9rieux were used. 90 mm Petri dishes from Trypcase Soy agar, Sabouraud Dextrose agar and Mac Conkey agar and 100 mL Trypcase Soy broth and 100 mL Mac Conkey broth of the liquid me-dia were used for manipulation.The test microorganisms that were part of this val-idation were the standard microorganisms recommend-ed by the current European Pharmacopeia for the meth-od suitability test. Those are: Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 (Ph.Eur., 2013).Method For determination of the antimicrobial activity and validation of the test method challenge test with the above mentioned microorganisms were used and the microbio-logical method of choice was the surface-spread method and direct inoculation in the liquid media for the test of ab-sence of Escherichia coli. The number of all microorgan-isms applied in the challenge tests was less than 100 cfu/mL. Each application was made in duplicate and the tem-S2 OP 60138Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 137 - 138 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationsperature and the time of incubation depended of the type of the medium. Trypcase Soy agar was incubated for five days at temperature from 30-35 \u02daC, Sabouraud Dextrose agar was incubated for seven days at temperature from 20-25 \u02daC, Trypcase Soy broth was incubated for 24h at tem-perature from 30-35 \u02daC, Mac Conkey broth was incubat-ed for 24h at temperature from 42-44 \u02daC and Mac Conkey agar was incubated for 24h at temperature from 30-35 \u02daC.After the incubation time the relation between the number of the each microorganism dissolved in buffered sodium chloride pepton water pH 7 and the number of the of the same microorganism in the presence of the product was calculated. When verifying the suitability of the plate-count method, a mean of any of the test organisms not dif-fering by a factor greater than 2 must be obtained (Clontz, 2009; Ph.Eur., 2013; USP, 2014).Results and discussionThe results from the determination of the antimicrobial activity of Gastoguard chewable tablets showed that it does not show antimicrobial effect against the used microorgan-isms. In addition to this the working dilution of the product would be 1:10 dilution. The individual challenge test revealed the following results:The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with P. aeruginosa was 93 cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 89 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.04.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with B. spizizenii was 52 cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 50 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.04.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with E. coli was 61cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the product was 50 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.22.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with S. aureus was 26 cfu/mL and the average num-ber of the microorganism in the presence of the product was 20 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.30.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with C. albicans was 31cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 37 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 0.84.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with A. brasiliensis was 22cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 24 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 0.92. The acceptability factors for all the used microorgan-isms were in the compatibility framework and they never exceed the value 2.In the test for absence of E. coli, there was good visible growth in Trypcase Soy broth after 24h and in Mac Conkey broth the growth was followed by a change of color of the medium. There was also presence of red non-mucous colo-nies on Mac Conkey agar after 24h.The growth promotion test of the used media showed that they are adequate for routine microbiological analysis.Conclusion Gastoguard chewable tablets do not have antimicrobi-al activity against the used test microorganisms.The method suitability test of the product revealed that the routine microbiological analysis should be performed with surface-spread method from 1:10 dilution for TAMC and TYMC and the method of direct inoculation in the test for absence of E. coli. The acceptability factors were in the frame provided by the current European Pharmacopeia and never exceeded the value 2.ReferencesClontz, L., 2009. Microbial limit and bioburden tests.

It is considered to be one of the most commonly consumed drugs with more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s population consuming caffeine daily. The Europeans are found to be the world\u2019s largest consumers of caffeine in-take of approximately 4.6 kg/person/year (Norton et al., 2014). The presence of the pharmaceutical residues in the environment has become the subject of growing concern in the past decade. Due to the continuous input that leads to the long-term adverse effects on the aquatic and terres-trial organisms, the special attention is being paid to their concentration levels in the aquatic environment. Caffeine can be found in traces in surface water. The main paths for caffeine to enter wastewater stream are either in urine or when caffeine-containing products are discharged through household pipelines or sewers. Determination of caffeine in surface water is an important task for environmental re-searches and analysis because it is found to be a good in-dicator for human sewage because of its relatively high concentrations in surface water and its unambiguous an-thropogenic origin. Other important usage of caffeine is as an analgesic adjuvant in drug formulations for the treat-ment of headache and pain related to postpartum, postop-erative, and dental surgery and it is therapeutically applied for the treatment of migraine in combination with other drugs such as aspirin, paracetamol and tramadol. Caffeine is claimed to enhance the efficacy of these drugs (Madhu-sudhan, 2013). The goals of this study were to develop and validate high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for caffeine determination in food, beverages, sur-face water and drugs which is simple and easy to perform. This method could have a widespread application in food, environmental and pharmaceutical sciences.Materials and methodsSamples for caffeine determination in food and bever-ages were purchased at the Serbian market, samples of sur-face water were collected in amber bottles from seven rep-resentative locations of the Danube River on the territory of Novi Sad, Serbia, and tablets of analgoantipyretics con-taining caffeine were purchased from pharmacies in the vi-cinity of Novi Sad, Serbia. Caffeine from all samples was separated by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by HPLC. The chromatography was using two-solvent isocratic elu-tion. The HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) model Agi-lent HP 1100 system equipped with an autosampler (Wald-bronn, Germany) was used. The analytical column was the Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, i.d., 5 \u00b5m particle size). Mobile phase was water-THF (0.1% THF in water adjusted to pH 8 with 0.1 M NaOH) - acetonitrile (90:10) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The HPLC mobile phase was prepared fresh daily and filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m nylon filter. Run time was 10 min, column temperature 25 \u00b0C and analytes were detected at 273 nm.Results and discussionThe linearity between caffeine concentrations and the response was tested for concentration levels ranging from (0.010-100) mg/L. High value of coefficient of correlation r=1 showed an excellent correlation between concentra-tions and peak areas. Calculated limit of detection (LOD-3.3*\u03c3/S) and quantification (LOQ-10*\u03c3/S) were 0.007 mg/L and 0.012 mg/L, respectively. According to the re-S2 OP 61140Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 139 - 140 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationscovery values of (98.33-100.22)% the method showed ac-ceptable accuracy. Repeatability of the method was test-ed by analyzing three different concentrations of caffeine standards in six repetitions. The relative standard devia-tions (RSD) ranged from 0.028% to 0.063% for retention time and from 0.015% to 0.65% for peak area showing ex-cellent repeatability. There were no interferences in the HPLC results by impurities or matrix in tested samples, which indicate that developed method, had very good se-lectivity.The results of caffeine content in food and beverag-es showed that it ranged 5.6-158 mg/100 g in food sam-ples, 24.71-30.81 mg/100 ml in commercial tea samples, 1328-3594 mg/100 g in coffees and 9.69-30.79 mg/100 ml in energy drinks. Also, obtained values in this study were consistent with the available manufacturer data. Analyz-ing surface water samples for caffeine, significant concen-trations were found at the sampling sites near the waste-water discharges. Mean caffeine concentrations for sum-mer, fall, winter and spring periods were 24.78 ng/L, 26.83 ng/L, 24.61 ng/L, and 86.29 ng/L, respectively. The high-est mean caffeine concentration was detected in samples collected in the spring period which is in an agreement with the literature (Fernandez et al., 2010). The caffeine content in combined non-narcotic analgoantipiretics varied from (96.48-100.74)% of the declared value. The require-ments of the British Pharmacopoeia include (95-105)% of active drug content. According to obtained data it can be concluded that all brands did meet this specification in the HPLC assay method.ConclusionIn this work a unique and simple to perform HPLC method was established for caffeine content determina-tion in food, beverages, surface water and analgoantipiret-ics. Obtained data for accuracy, repeatability, selectivity and robustness confirmed that the proposed method could be used for routine control of caffeine content in differ-ent mixtures. The results of food and beverages analysis showed that caffeine content was consistent with the avail-able manufacturer data and obtained data for combined commercial formulations of non-narcotic analgoantipiret-ics of all brands did meet specification of the British Phar-macopoeia for active drug content. Testing the surface wa-ter samples for caffeine showed that significant concentra-tions were found at the sampling sites near the wastewater discharges. The potential risk for chronic effects may occur in resident organisms in the long-term period so an appro-priate treatment of wastewater would be essential in pre-vention of the potential pollution.ReferencesFernandez, C., Gonzales-Doncel, M., Pro, J.,Carbonell, G.,Tarazona, J.V., 2010.

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that ex-ists in eight different forms, among them, \u03b1-tocopherol is the most active form in humans. Vitamin E is very popular cosmetic ingredient. It acts as antioxidant to protect cells against free radicals and reduces oxidative stress. Ultravio-let light and environmental pollutants are known initiators of free radicals and skin damage. Topical antioxidants have the potential to diminish the reactive oxygen species gen-erated from the UVA radiation. For that reason, there is an increasing interest in the incorporation of vitamins and an-tioxidants in skin care products (Lupo, 2001).The stability of the vitamin E in the cosmetic formu-lations and when applied to the skin is low. When exposed to UV light, it forms \u03b1-tocopheroxyl radicals that consume other antioxidants for recycling. For better stability, vita-min E is commonly used as a biologically non-active ester-ified form, such as tocopheryl acetate (Shapiro and Saliou, 2001). Vitamin E esters act as a pro-drug since they are hy-drolyzed to the active vitamin E (\u03b1-tocopherol) upon pen-etration into skin. However, there is conflicting evidence as to what extent this conversion actually takes place in the skin and many studies have shown that these substi-tutes have very low biological activity. While numerous topical skin care products claim to contain \u2018\u2018vitamin E\u2019\u2019, these products may actually contain very different concen-trations and forms including active vitamin E, its several esters and many other derivatives (Thiele and Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage, 2007).The solid and emulsified cosmetic products must be carefully prepared for any of instrumental techniques which would be employed in the tocopherol analysis. The aim of this study was to develop an effective solid-phase extraction procedure for the HPLC determination of \u03b1-tocopheryl acetate, which could be important for assess-ment the content of this synthetic form of vitamin E in sun-screen lotions and creams. Materials and methodsMaterialsMethanol, ethanol and acetonitrile used in this work were of HPLC grade (J.T.Baker). \u03b1-tocopheryl acetate (TA) of analytical grade was obtained from Fluka (Fluka-Analytical BioChemika). Stock solution of 1.03 mg/mL was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amounts of the \u03b1-tocopheryl acetate in absolute ethanol. Two sets of cali-bration standards were prepared by diluting aliquots of the stock solution.Cosmetic productsCommercial sunscreen products were purchased from a local cosmetic shop. Formulations under study were Pro-ducer 1-Sun Lotion SPF 30 and Producer 2-Sunscreen cream SPF 50. According to the product label, both formu-lations contained vitamin E only in the form of tocopheryl acetate and TA content was not exactly declared.Sample preparationA 0.5 g of the formulation was measured in 20 ml plas-tic volumetric container and 0.5 mL of 0.5% ascorbic acid was added. The emulsion was dissolved by vortex-mixing with 5 mL of ethanol. After centrifugation for 10 min, a 3 mL of the supernatant was pipetted and applied to the SPE column.SPE conditionsSolid phase extraction was performed on Chromabond C18ec cartridges (1ml/100mg, Macherey\u2013Nagel, GmbH, D\u00fcren, Germany), which was previously selected among S2 PP 62142Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 141 - 142 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsfive cartridges with different sorbent type. Cartridges were conditioned with 1mL of deionized water, followed by 1mL of methanol and 1mL of acetonitrile. After the sam-ple was aspirated through the cartridge, analyte elution was made by 2 x 1 mL of methanol.HPLC conditionsThe Agilent Technologies 1200 Series apparatus with DAD and FL detection was used for the analysis. Sepa-ration was performed on the Restek Ultra IBD C18 col-umn (150 mm x 3 mm, 3 \u03bcm). UV detector was set at 220 nm and 295 nm. Based on our previous work, 100% ace-tonitrile was selected as the optimal mobile phase (Sunari\u0107 et al., 2012). The column temperature was maintained at 40\u00b0C and the flow rate was kept at 0.45 ml/min.Results and discussionTocopheryl acetate in extracted samples of the sun-screen formulations was identified by comparing the re-tention time of the observed chromatographic peak with that of the standard. Recovery of the solid-phase extrac-tion method was calculated by comparison of the TA peak area for extracted and non-extracted standard TA solution on five different cartridges. The obtained recovery value was higher than 85% for Chromabond C18ec, therefore this cartridge was selected for further analysis. Addition-ally, the cartridge selection was confirmed by extraction of the real samples supernatants obtained in sample prepa-ration procedure for the examined cosmetics. Even in this case, the highest chromatographic peak area of TA was ob-tained on Chromabond C18ec cartridge.  The calibration curves for two concentration ranges, 0.2 \u03bcg/mL - 2.0 \u03bcg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL - 1.0 mg/mL with the correlation coefficients > 0.998 were constructed and applied for the determination of TA in the injected samples. Final tocopheryl acetate content found in the examined formulations was as follows: (200\u00b115) mg/100g (0.2%) in Producer 1-Sun Lotion SPF 30 and (490\u00b120) mg/100g (0.49%) in Producer 2-sunscreen cream SPF 50. These re-sults are in agreement with those given by other authors, that TA content is from 0.1% to 1% (Shapiro and Saliou, 2001; Thiele and Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage, 2007). As was expected, much higher content of TA was found in the formulation with a higher SPF level.ConclusionCosmetic formulations contain a high number of in-gredients and the analysis often requires extensive pre-treatments. A SPE method followed by HPLC determina-tion has been developed for the analysis of tocopheryl ace-tate in cosmetics. For the present experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the proposed extraction method was appropriate for the determination of TA in sunscreen lotion and cream. The extraction procedure was efficient, showing good accuracy and precision. Proposed analytical procedure for TA determination can be useful tool to know the amount of this synthetic form of vitamin E in cosmet-ic products.

D, Blvd. Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* szlatanovic@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionNon-sterile drugs must satisfy the appropriate microbi-ological purity criteria which are included in monographs in pharmacopoeias. Pharmacopoeial studies are prepared specifically to ensure that the medicinal product is thera-peutically effective and safe for the patient.Caffetin Cold is a combined medicinal product, con-taining several active ingredients: paracetamol (500 mg), pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (30 mg), dextrometho-rphan hydrobromide (15 mg) and ascorbic acid (60 mg). Paracetamol is a pain reliever and reduces body tempera-ture. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride decreases nasal con-gestion, allowing nasal and respiratory passages to open up. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide suppress cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation. Ascorbic acid (Vi-tamin C) fortifies the immune system (www.alkaloid.com.mk/vademecum-step-2.nspx?LekTipId=64). The importance of determination of microbiological purity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in solid forms comes from the fact that the final product must com-ply with the criteria for microbiological purity.Objective: Validation of analytical method for deter-mination of microbiological purity of paracetamol, pseu-doephedrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobro-mide and ascorbic acid in the composition of Caffetin cold tablets. This method further should be used for routine de-termination of microbiological purity of APIs in Caffetin cold tablets. The method should be simple for manipula-tion and in compliance with the current edition of Europe-an Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur., 2013).Materials and methodsMaterialsStandard laboratory equipment was used. Buffered so-dium chloride peptone solution pH 7.0 was used as medi-um for dissolving of the sample and for making the dilu-tions of the culture suspensions.Ready to use nutrient media from BioM\u00e9rieux\u00ae (69280 Marcy-l\u2019Etoile-France) 90 mm Petri dishes of Trypcase Soy agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar were used.Standard test microorganisms recommended by the current Ph.Eur. for the method suitability test: Escherichia Coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergil-lus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 were used for challenge test.MethodsSurface-spread method and determination of antimi-crobial activity of APIs in Caffetin cold tablets was used. The number of all test microorganisms applied in the chal-lenge tests was less than 100 cfu/ml. Each application was made in duplicate and the temperature and time of incu-bation depended of the type of the medium. Trypcase Soy agar was incubated for five days at a temperature from 30-35 \u02daC, Sabouraud Dextrose agar was incubated for 7 days at a temperature from 20-25 \u02daC. After the incubation time, the relation between the number of the each test microor-ganism dissolved in buffered sodium chloride pepton solu-tion pH 7.0, and the number of that test microorganism in the presence of the product was calculated.

The reliability of the method is remarkably dependent upon the timely recognition of all factors that may generate erroneus resuts once the validated method is applied in practice. Therefore the scientific approach in course of LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method development should involve risk analysis. The risk analysis denotes as-sessment of all critical steps (factors) that may affect the accuracy and ruggedness of the method. Matrix effect, me-tabolite interference, stability of the analyte and the selec-tion of an adequate regression model are identified as most common sources of method imprecision (Mulvana, 2010). Assessment of critical steps in bioanalytical method developmentMatrix effect (ME) is directly related to the sample clean-up procedure, thus selecting the optimal extraction procedure plays a crucial role for ensuring data quality in LC-MS/MS bioanalysis (Chambers et al., 2007). Different types of extraction procedures, depending on the analyte, exhibit different extraction recoveries and ME. Therefore testing out various extraction procedures should become inevitable part of the contemporary bioanalytical meth-od development. The implementation of Quality by de-sign, as a new trend, enables shortening the time needed for the optimization of the sample preparation procedure. Until recently, the optimal extraction procedure was cho-sen only upon the extraction recovery. However, consider-ing the LC-MS/MS analysis, the cleanliness of the extract, expressed through ME, obtained with different extraction procedures gains paramount importance. The EMA vali-dation guideline (\u0415\u041c\u0410, 2011) recommends evaluation of the variability of the internal standard (IS)-normalized ME. However, it is more rational to assesses the degree of the absolute ME itself and not just the variability of the IS-nor-malized ME. This derives from the fact that the IS-normal-ized ME indicates that ME is consistent and not affected by the different lots of biological material. On the other hand, the absolute ME points out to the cleanliness of the ex-tracts (Nakov et al., 2015). Hence, it becomes evident that the selection of the sample preparation procedure should be based on the absolute ME and the extraction recovery should be put in second place, especially when problems related to the sensitivity of the method are not expected. The quantitative acceptance criteria applied in bioan-alytical validation guidelines (EMA, 2011; FDA, 2001) rely on data generated using quality control (QC) samples. However the QC samples do not contain phase I and II me-tabolites of the analyte of interest and therefore may be un-reliable model for real study samples. These metabolites are usually not stable and they can convert back to their parent drug in the mass spectrometer (in source back-con-version) and/or during sample preparation (in vitro back-conversion), jeopardizing the accuracy of the bioanalyti-cal method (Wenkui et al., 2011). Therefore the assessment of the possibility of metabolite back-conversion prior the method validation becomes a crucial part of risk analysis. The first step includes assessment of the in source back-conversion through the verification of the chromatographic separation between the analyte and its metabolite. This is especially important for high throughput LC-MS/MS anal-ysis, where chromatographic separation between the ana-lyte and the metabolite can be compromised, resulting in overestimated measurements. In case of this type of inter-S2 PP 64146Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 145 - 146 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsference, optimization/modification of the ion source pa-rameters and/or the chromatographic conditions should be applied. The metabolite back-conversion could also occur during the different steps of the sample preparation pro-cess, so second step involves investigation whether the proposed extraction procedure leads to metabolite back-conversion. For that purpose the optimized extraction pro-cedure should be applied on samples containing only the metabolite standard and the amount of analyte generated by metabolite back-conversion is then computed. In case of unavailability of metabolite standards, stability exper-iments under different storage conditions using real sam-ples could be applied as well (Jemal et al., 2010). The investigation of the sample stability in course of method development helps to avoid stability related prob-lems that may latter appear during the validation and appli-cation of the method. Although various sources may affect the sample stability, the focus within this paper is placed on chiral interconversion. All chiral compounds may undergo in vitro R/S conversion occurring at physiological pH and temperature or under extreme pH and elevated temperature (Briscoe and Hage, 2009). Therefore the assessment of the possibility of R/S interconversion during the overall ana-lytical procedure should be an integral part for every enan-tioselective method development, thus allowing quantifi-cation of the extent of in vivo interconversion without bias.The selection of an adequate regression model is the basis for accurate and reproducible quantification over the whole concentration range (Rozet et al., 2011). Most bio-analytical methods usually have wide concentration range, so heteroscedasticity of the data may be expected. In the above instance weighted linear or quadratic regression models should be applied. The recommendation of the reg-ulatory agencies (EMA, 2011; FDA 2001) is that the sim-plest model that adequately describes data should be used and the selection of more complex model should be jus-tified. Therefore the use of statistical approach based on non-parametric statistical tests (Nakov et al., 2014; Singto-roj et al., 2006) during the selection of the regression mod-el will provide justification of the choice of the adequate regression model, and will enable accurate quantification in whole calibration range.SummaryThe implementation of risk analysis during the LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method development is longer last-ing process compared to conventional method develop-ment. However the timely perceiving and assessment of the critical steps generates highly reliable bioanalytical methods and lowers the possibility of late discovery of un-expected problems than often lead to method re-optimiza-tion and revalidation.ReferencesBriscoe, C.J., Hage, D.S., 2009.

Macedonia* Hadzievam@yahoo.comIntroductionForced degradation studies provide data to support identification of possible degradants; degradation path-ways and intrinsic stability of the drug molecule and vali-dation of stability indicating analytical procedures (Singh and Bakshi, 2002). Although most of the literature de-fines the concept of forced degradation, they do not pro-vide detailed information about a forced degradation strat-egy (Klick et al., 2005) and the experimental conditions to conduct forced degradation are described in a general way (Singh and Bakshi, 2000) without description of the exact stress conditions to be applied. Generally, a trial and error approach is adopted to select the strength, temperature and time of exposure to achieve loss of active substance from 10\u201330% (ICH, 2003; Singh and Bakshi, 2000). Such approach involves consid-erable cost, time consumption and scientific expertise and there is high incidence of random results. Therefore a need for more systematic approach is recognized (Dolan, 2002).A contemporary approach in the field of forced degra-dation is to evaluate correlation of degradation parameters by applying the concept of design of experiment (DoE). In turn, this can help studying the combination of conditions where optimal enrichment of degradation products is ob-tained.  The basic concept of factorial design is performing an experiment in which all the possible combinations of fac-tors and levels are investigated (Lundstedt et al., 1988).Literature review reveals the implementation of DoE and factorial design concepts for optimization of forced degradation conditions (Kurmi et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2013; Sonawane and Gide., 2011), but no report exists on application of DoE for simvastatin (SIM) as model drug.The aim of this study was to develop stability-indicat-ing LC-MS method for quantification of SIM and its im-purities, and also, an attempt was made to simplify forced degradation studies by adopting DoE concept.Materials and methodsSimvastatin (SIM) samples with Certificate of Suit-ability to the monographs of the European Pharmacopoia (CEP) were used. Simvastatin CRS and Simvastatin for peak identification were provided by the EDQM (Stras-bourg, France). All reagents used were of analytical grade.Experiments were made on Dionex UltiMate\u2122 3000 (Thermo Scientific), interfaced with mass spectrometer with an electrosparay-ionization source, operated in neg-ative mode. Mass parameters were optimized as follows: Ion source heater temperature was set at 350 \u00b0C; capillary temperature at 300 \u00b0C; capillary voltage was 10 V with collision energy 35 eV. The separation was performed on Poroshell 120 EC C18 (Agilent Technologies, USA), 50 x 3.0 mm, 2.7 \u03bcm, using buffer (10 mM ammonium format, pH 4.0) and acetonitrile as a mobile phase in a gradient mode. The column temperature was 40 \u00b0C. Flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. Injection volume was 5 \u03bcL. UV detection was performed at 238 nm. SIM was subjected to stress under acidic, alkaline, ox-idative, thermal and photolytic conditions. Variables, cho-sen from previously conducted initial experiments were: time of exposure, temperature and stressor strength. The forced degradation experiments set-up on the basis of 2n full factorial design were performed and the obtained re-sults from LC-MS samples were analyzed by Design Ex-S2 PP 65148Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 147 - 148 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationspert Software (Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Acid and alkali degradation was performed using 23 factorial design (three variables considered at two levels: 0.01M and 0.1M HCl/ NaOH heated at 25 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C for 60 and 120 min) was conducted to set up eight experi-ments for each stressor. For oxidative degradation two variables were consid-ered at two levels (the high level for H2O2 and time was 30% and 24 h, and the low level was 3% and 2 h, respec-tively), a 22 factorial design was conducted to set up four experiments. 22 factorial designs was conducted to set up thermal degradation where the high level values were 105\u00b0C and 5 h and the low level were 80 \u00b0C and 3 h, respectively. Photo degradation study was performed by exposing the drug powder, spread as a thin film in a covered petri plates and exposed to direct sunlight for 3, 5 and 12 h. Ad-ditionally, control study in dark was run simultaneously. All stress studies were performed at an initial drug con-centration of 1 mg/mL in amber color glassware in order to protect the solutions from light degradation.Results and discussionUnder the proposed chromatographic conditions, sat-isfactory separation (Rs >1.5) of SIM and all seven impu-rities stated in the European pharmacopeia was achieved proving the stability-indicating power of the method. Ac-cording to the results obtained from the degradation study SIM is susceptible to degradation under acid, alkali, oxi-dative and photolytic conditions. The applied factorial de-sign, determine significant factors responsible for degra-dation and provides prediction of the optimal conditions.The relationship between each factor and their interac-tion were evaluated by creating Pareto chart. These analy-sis indicated that under acidic condition, strength of HCl and temperature were most significant factors and for alka-line condition, temperature and time of exposure. Further-more, desirability plots were generated for acid and alka-li conditions, providing prediction of conditions for opti-mum degradation. It was suggested that for acidic stress, 10% degrada-tion would be achieved by treating with 0.1 M HCl at 25 \u00b0C for 60 min. When these conditions were adopted in practice, the resulting degradation was 10.78%. Also, for alkaline degradation 10% degradation would be achieved by using 0.1M NaOH heated for 10 min. at 25 \u00b0C. The actual degradation, when these conditions were adopted in practice was 11.12%.For oxidative degradation, it has been observed that 18.75% degradation can be achieved with 30% H2O2 at 25 \u00b0C for 60 min. For photolytic conditions about 3.9% degradation has been obtained after exposure of UV light for 12h.The desirability plots obtained from thermal degra-dation study demonstrated that an increase in temperature from 80 \u00b0C to 105 \u00b0C favored the degradation significantly. The targeted drug degradation was obtained heating the so-lution at 80 \u00b0C for 5 h.Thus, factorial design approach was successfully used to achieve optimum degradation conditions for SIM and simple, specific, stability-indicating LC/MS method was developed.ConclusionThis study highlights significant utility of DoE in op-timization of forced degradation conditions. Using 2n full factorial design degradation conditions were optimized to obtain the targeted level of degradation. The use of DoE to identify theoretical values of variables for optimum deg-radation was successful, because when these parameters were put in practice, the % degradation obtained matched the predicted degradation. This suggests that factorial de-sign approach can replace the trial and error approach used to achieve optimum degradation in forced degradation studies.ReferencesDolan, J.W., 2002.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* anpo@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionOrganic solvents are widely used in the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products. Their application in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is of exceptional importance as the use of appropriate solvents may enhance the yield or determine characteristics such as crystal form, purity and solubility (Grodowska and Parcze-wski, 2010). The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur., 2015) limits the amount of residual solvents (RS) in pharmaceuti-cals, considering the ICH guideline for RS (Q3C). Beyond the influence on safety and quality of the active pharmaceu-tical ingredients, the residual solvent profile indicates their manufacturing history. This core parameter for API finger-printing allows for authentication and identification of the API origin (Poceva-Panovska et al., 2016).  MethodologyThe main technique employed in RS analysis is gas chromatography (GC) because of its suitability for anal-ysis of volatile samples and substantial separating capa-bility of capillary columns. European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.) in the general chapter recommend GC coupled with headspace (HS) sampling system for qualitative and quan-titative determinations of residual solvent. This technique is robust, convenient and readily automated and it is the method that is generally used for the control of residual solvents. As reported in 80% of the literature citations for GC procedures on RS testing, flame ionization detector (FID) is most commonly used for the detection of resolved compounds because of its low detection limits, wide lin-ear dynamic range, robustness, ease of operation, and gen-eral reliability and utility, especially for trace organic com-pounds (Camarasu et al., 2006). However profiling of the RSs in practice using the GC-FID method, usually require additional identification tool because of the co-elution and possible misinterpretation of the RS peaks. In order to confirm identifications and solve co-elutions Ph. Eur. proposes conformation analysis to be performed on a second chromatographic column coated with different stationary phase.Another more convenient approach to solve possi-ble misinterpretation of the RS peaks is the use of GC-FID/MS, since the mass spectrometer adds an additional spectrometric dimension to the identification. Mass spec-trometry also excels for determination of co-eluting peaks through use of extracted ion or SIM ion chromatograms, thereby eliminating the need of additional analysis on dif-ferent columns (Poceva-Panovska et al., 2016).  Sample preparationAlthough pharmacopoeias propose their methods for control of residual solvents, practically and through the lit-erature they are found to be disadvantageous due to their long equilibration and analysis time, relatively complex sample preparation and quantification problems. In order to solve these issues, different aspects of method develop-ment and sample preparation have to be considered. Opti-mized sample preparation conditions, including HS condi-tions and dilution media, are crucial for the reliability of the residual profiling results.S2 PP 66150Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 149 - 150 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsInternal standardThe proposed Ph. Eur. methodology for RS analysis does not utilize internal standard (IS) for quantification. The use of IS in RS analysis can be beneficial since it ac-counts for routine variation in the response of the GC sys-tem and can considerably improve the precision of quanti-tative analysis. When choosing IS for HS-GC analysis, be-side the chromatographic and physico-chemical character-istics, it is mandatory to consider the stability and reactiv-ity of the compound candidate for the IS. Many of the or-ganic compounds have functionalities that may be reactive at elevated temperatures and different pH values during the equilibration time. IS decomposition or formation of a new product can lead to misinterpretation of the results and poor quality of the analysis (Poceva-Panovska et al. 2016). Optimization of headspace parametarsVial equilibration temperature and time are major HS parameters that can be used to improve the transfer of vol-atile analytes from the sample into the HS of the vial. The equilibration temperature has a profound effect on the sensitivity of the method because temperature has a di-rect impact on the equilibrium concentration of the RS in the HS of the sample vial. However, effect of the temper-ature is specific for the RS tested. The increase of the tem-perature enhances the headspace sensitivity for the polar compounds with high partition coefficients (K) only, while the non-polar compounds with low K were practically not affected, since temperature affects the fraction of the ana-lyte (RS) in the condense fraction only. Sufficient time is also crucial in order to achieve con-stant state of equilibrium. Equilibration times should be set to optimal as they can considerably shortened overall method analysis time.According to our recent study (Poceva Panovska et al., 2016) the increase of equilibration temperature and equil-ibration time generally resulted in better sensitivity, al-though the effect of equilibration time was not as profound as temperature. For equilibration times longer than 20 min, no significant increase in the chromatographic responses of RS was observed. This observation has considerably short-ened the overall time for RS analysis when compared to the official Ph.Eur. method.Dilution mediaAnother approach to increase the sensitivity in the RS analysis is by selecting suitable dilution media as it has di-rect influence on partition coefficient. Organic solvents used as dilution media (DMSO, DMF etc.) offer higher partition coefficient values for most of the RSs when compared with water and consequently lower the concentration of the RS in the gaseous (HS) phase. According to the Ph.Eur., the choice of sample preparation technique is dependent on sample sol-ubility in the dilution solvent. For water soluble substances water is used and for water insoluble substances an alterna-tive sample preparation is considered, using DMF as solvent. The use of single sample preparation for water soluble and water insoluble substances is highly practical and bene-ficial. A mixture that includes DMSO, as a solvent with ex-ceptional properties for organic and inorganic chemicals and low toxicity (class III), and water that is crucial for better sensitivity, in a suitable ratio usually offers satisfactory re-sults as dilution media. Additionally the sensitivity of the analysis can be increased with the decrease of the percentage of organic dilution media (DMSO). A mixture of DMSO/wa-ter in ratio 1:4 (V/V) can be used as a dilution media regard-less of the sample solubility (Poceva-Panovska et al. 2016).Chemometric approach in optimization of analytical methodsDevelopment and optimization of methods for RS pro-filing require a well-designed strategy for efficient data pro-cessing in an economical and timesaving manner. For exact determination of the relationship between the sample prep-aration conditions and the chromatographic response of the analytes, design of experiments (DoE) can be effectively em-ployed since it enables the maximum utilization of data from previously planned experiments. Furthermore, by conducting the optimization of the method in very rational manner us-ing DoE, a great deal of excessive and unproductive labora-tory research work can be avoided. Response surface meth-odology (RSM) can be used to optimize experimental values for important experimental factors (Lundstedt et al., 1998).ReferencesCamarasu, C., Madichie, C., Williams R., 2006.

Macedonia* tatjanadm@yahoo.comIntroductionHealth care-associated infections or nosocomial infec-tions can be defined as those occurring within 48 hours of hospital admission, 3 days of discharge or 30 days of an operation. Hospital-acquired infection is an infection that is contracted from the environment or staff of a healthcare facility. It can be spread in the hospital environment, nurs-ing home environment, rehabilitation facility, clinic or oth-er clinical settings. Infection is spread to the susceptible pa-tient in the clinical setting by a number of means (Inwereg-bu et al., 2005; WHO, 2007). Nosocomial infections are huge problem all over the world. They are a major problem in health care facilities, resulting in extended durations of care, substantial morbidity and mortality, and excess costs. Effective hand hygiene of the health care workers remains the single most important and economical means of con-trolling the nosocomial infections. Every health care work-er is responsible for maintaining high personal standards of hygiene and hand cleanliness (WHO, 2007). The etiol-ogy of nosocomial infections, the frequency of contami-nated hands with the different nosocomial pathogens, and the role of health care workers\u2019 hands suggest that spe-cial attention should be paid on selection of hand hygiene preparations as well on the compliance to the hand disin-fection protocols. From the times of I. P. Semelweiss, we know that clean hands are the most important single fac-tor that can decrease the extent of the health-care associ-ated infections. Handwashing frequently is called the sin-gle most important and the cheapest measure to reduce the risks of transmitting skin microorganisms from one per-son to another or from one site to another on the same pa-tient (Borges et al., 2012). Since alcohol-based hand sani-tizers combine high immediate antimicrobial efficacy with ease of use (Christiaens et al., 2006) they are the main dis-infectants in our hospital as they are in almost every hos-pital worldwide. The pharmacists from the hospital phar-macy in our hospital are obviously members in the tender commission for selections of the disinfectants and the in-evitable link in the supplying of disinfectants as well, so a complaint from the intensive care ward nurse, for inappro-priate selection of the disinfectants was directly addressed to us. Considering that we decided to conduct microbiolog-ical tests of antimicrobial efficacy of the two rapid alcohol-based hand disinfectants used by caregivers in the hospital.Materials and methodsWe selected \u201cfingerpad method\u201d-appropriate samples collected from the subject\u2019s fingers, as a suitable model for testing the in vivo efficacy of hand-washing agents (Ansa-ri et al., 1989), for our purpose-to test microbiological ef-ficacy of two rapid alcohol-based hand disinfectants. The examination consisted of two parts on the randomly select-ed health care workers including nurses, physicians and subsidiary hospital staff. In the first part of the examina-tion these seven clinical wards were included: Maxilo-fa-cial surgery, Ophthalmology with ophthalmo-surgery, Ot-S2 PP 67152Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 151 - 152 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsto-Rhino-Laringology, Gynecology and Obstetrics, An-aesthesia Reanimation and Intensive Care, General sur-gery and Orthopedy. The selection of the clinical wards was planed according to grade of risk for developing nos-ocomial infection. One of the selected wards was the one that the complaint for the inappropriate selection and sup-ply of disinfectants came. The observers and facilitators of the test procedures were three pharmacists and one nurse. Each pharmacist had different task in the examination with intention of minimizing the bias. Total number of included respondents (health care givers) was 54; 34 in the first part and 20 in the second part of the examination. 54 (Biomer-ieux) COUNT-TACT AGAR for aerobic mesophyllic bac-teria and 54 (Biomerieux) VRBG AGAR for Gram nega-tive/enterobacteria determination were used, for each part of the examination proportionally to the respondents. Eco-sal\u00ae Forte an ethanol/2-propanol based disinfectant and Ecosal\u00ae Ultra a 1-propanol, 2-propanol+benzalconium chloride disinfectant were used. Incubation, cultivation and determination of the bacterial growth were done in the Centre for public health at the Department for sanitary mi-crobiology (accredited according to ISO 17025).Results and discussionFingerpad/touch method with not disinfected hands showed abundant bacterial growth on both type of agar. There was only one VRBG AGAR for Gram negative/en-terobacteria determination, from the undisinfected hands, without any bacterial growth, that represented 2.940% of total VRBG AGAR in the first part of examination. There were 9 cases (of total 34) of aerobic mesophyllic bacteri-al growth on disinfected hands. That number represented 26.471% of which, 2 plates were for Ecosal\u00ae Forte and 7 plates for Ecosal\u00ae Ultra. Those were from the hands of subsidiary hospital workers that were not very familiar with the hand disinfection protocol and from staff not applied sufficient volume of disinfectant or/and didn\u203at let sufficient time (30 sec.) for antimicrobial action. Both, facilitators and observers of the examination, noticed and reported various irregularities in the hand disinfection protocol during first part of examination (Alkaloid-AD Skopje, 2014). Trend of recontamination of the hands of the health care workers included in the study, with touch-ing other objects or part/s of the face, after the hand dis-infection was reported. Those irregularities were decisive for performing the second examination part-repetition of the test on the clinical departments where microbial growth appeared after disinfection of the hands, on the same work-ers as in the first part, but after a lesson of appropriate edu-cation. In the first part of examination there was no case of Gram negative/entherobacteria growth. In the second part of the examination, i.e. the repeated tests with both dis-infectants, there was no case of any bacterial growth, nor aerobic mesophylic or entherobacteria neither on Ecosal\u00ae Forte nor on Ecosal\u00ae Ultra. The presence of aerobic me-sophyllic bacterial growth, in the first part of the examina-tion, after the disinfection of the hands appeared from the air or from the weaknesses stated above.ConclusionThis examination highlighted the importance of effi-cient disinfection of health care workers\u2019 hands. Absence of any bacterial growth on the repeated controls implied of efficient antimicrobial activity of both disinfectant. Select-ed rapid hand disinfectants were effective. Non-adherence to the hand hygiene protocol was reason for bacteriological contaminated smears occurrence. That confirmed that the hand hygiene on the medical staff is a quality indicator for nosocomial infections prevention. In the Commission for prevention of nosocomial infection in our hospital, a phar-macist should be incorporated for education of the medi-cal and subsidiary staff for the importance of hand disin-fectants selection and of the adherence to the hand hygiene protocols. That will contribute for reducing of the nosoco-mial infections and improvement of the patients\u2019 care, out-comes and safety.ReferencesAlkaloid-AD Skopje, 2014.

Pharmaceutical industry, Microbiology laboratory, Tirana, Albania* eva_troja@yahoo.comBackgroundSterile drugs and medical devices must be tested with the bacterial endotoxin test (BET) and must be shown to contain less than Endotoxin Limit. BET testing is a catego-ry IV test as listed in United States Pharmacopeia <1225> and requires specificity testing. Procedure should be veri-fied to establish its suitability for use, such as their accura-cy and absence of interference when used for a new prod-uct or raw material. In common with many other Quality Control (QC) tests, validation is a key element in preparing for testing and product release. Bacterial endotoxin test The three essentials for BET include endotoxin lim-its for pharmaceutical and medical devices, procedures for validation in laboratory, and procedures for conducting routine testing. Different pharmacopoeias, LAL manufac-turer\u2019s documentation, and US Food and Drug Adminis-tration (FDA) document are available to the user when un-dertaking validation. Finished preparation release checks are still required according to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> (USP, 2006). The QC laboratory fa-cilitates these release checks by utilizing its staff\u2019s thor-ough understanding of the regulatory requirements and em-ploying analytical techniques that ensure preparation safe-ty. Even with this knowledge, challenges arise in microbi-ological testing of some preparations. The key challeng-es are the development of new and more sensitive meth-ods and the interpretations of some results (Troja, 2010). On june 22, 2011, FDA withdrew the LAL test Guide-line, which was issued in 1987 (Cooper, 2011). Elements of Guideline continued to impact current methods because they can be found in other references relied on by the in-dustry. Following European, Japanese, and US Pharma-copeia harmonization, the tests methods are identical and these tests are described in the Bacterial Endotoxins Test chapter in the USP (Chapter <85>) and in the equivalent chapters in the European pharmacopeia (Chapter 2.6.14) and the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (General Tests, No. 4.01). Endotoxin testing presents many challenges, yet trouble-shooting is generally more effective because of the infor-mation generated from each test (USP, 2006). It is critical that the user know the concentration of active substance, excipients, final pH and maximum human dose per hour, and whether the preparation contains a suspending agent such as carboxymethyl cellulose. The analyst must deter-mine the conditions under which the product does not in-terfere with BET. The dilution of product is the best choice to overcome inhibition or enhancement. This information is helpful in performing calculations to find the maximum valid concentration, and in determining the endotoxin lim-it when not published. The maximum human dose is es-pecially important in establishing an endotoxin limit for combination medicines such as multivitamins. On the ba-sis of this information, the laboratory can test the prepara-tion and obtain the accurate endotoxin data. By incorporat-ing the patient\u2019s body weight (EU/kg) into a suitable equa-tion, the allowable endotoxin limit (EL) can be calculated for the preparation class (e.g., intrathecal, subcutaneous-ly, or radiopharmaceuticals). The potency of an endotox-in to cause pyrogenic reaction is variable according to dif-ferent factors, such as the nature of the toxin, the weight of the subject and the maximum human dose. Therefore, the endotoxin concentrations are expressed as Endotoxin Units (EU) for result comparisons. The endotoxin limit for pharmaceuticals products is calculated using the formula: K/M, where K is the threshold human pyrogenic dose of endotoxin per kilogram (kg) of body weight per hour, and M is the maximum recommended human dose/kg of body weight that would be administered in a single one-hour pe-S2 PP 68154Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 153 - 154 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsriod. The creation of the general endotoxin limit of 5 EU/kg/hour enabled the industry to develop dose-related lim-its for individual and classes of parenteral drugs and de-vices. However the EL for intrathecal administration was assigned arbitrarily and was not science-based (Munson, 2010). Williams (2007) has recently shown endotoxin tol-erance or allowable limit by type of parenteral products. FDA proposed to the USP Micro committee an endotox-in limit of 2.0 EU/dose/eye for intraocular administration, consistent with ISO 11979-9:2006 Ophthalmic Implants, Intraocular Lenses. An endotoxin limit for topical ophthal-mic administration was not proposed. FDA suggests to ap-plicants that EU for topical eye drops is 0.5 EU/ml, but BET interference is high because of additives. A major-ity of the substances tested for endotoxin interfere with the LAL test to some degree (the obvious exception being water samples). An understanding of the chemistry of the test sample and its possible effects upon endotoxin and/or LAL, can aid in overcoming interference problems (Daw-son, 2005). It is often possible to overcome interference by diluting the sample at which the endotoxin limit concen-tration is still detectable or choosing ultrafiltration meth-od. The greatest dilution at which the endotoxin limit can be detected is the maximum valid dilution (MVD). Dilu-tion is always the technique of choice and should be at-tempted first. The LAL Guideline described ways to devel-op test parameters by use of the MVD and Minimum Val-id Concentration (MVC) to prepare samples for endotox-in testing, independent of the method. MVD and MVC are calculated as below: MVD= EL/\u03bb ; MVC= \u03bb/EL, where \u03bb is sensitivity of lysate. MVD is used for products with EL in EU/mL. MVC is used for products with EL in EU/mg or some other unit. Once calculations of EL, MVD, MVC are done, the analyst can start the interference/validation test-ing. The user should prepare several sample dilutions be-tween undiluted and the MDV or MVC. The other steps of product validation are Control Standard Curve, Positive Product Control (PPC) and Positive and Negative Sample and Water Controls. The critical components are a test ma-terial (diluted to an extent that was validated) and a posi-tive control, which must be recovered within a prescribed range. Recovery of the PPC allows the analyst to have con-fidence in test results. Several researchers have found that even the selection of lysate reagent source can contribute to variability in test results. Therefore, if any change in re-agent source is made, the test must be re-validated.ConclusionsAfter the determination of EL, MVD, and MVC, the analyst should undertake validation to confirm perfor-mance and to assure reproducibility. Product validation steps include reagent and sample preparation, selection of sample preparation, and calculation of endotoxin value in product. Final choice to set up efficient BET testing meth-od is up to the budget, application (water, raw material, in-process sample or final products), material and volume to be tested, endotoxin limit and degree of compliance.

Disinfectants are chemicals that act as microbicides or microbiostatics of ob-jects and the environment. They are present on the market as finished industrial products obtained in different concen-trations and forms depending of its purpose. In the compo-sition of disinfectants enter a wide variety of active chem-ical agents (biocides). According to their chemical compo-sition they represent alcohols, aldehydes, anilides, bigua-nides, diamines, halogen release agents, silver compounds, peroxides, phenols, bis-phenols, halophenols, quaterna-ry ammonium compounds, volatile compounds for ster-ilization. Biocide is a general term describing a chemical agent, usually with a broad spectrum of activity that inac-tivates microorganisms. The biocide activity is within the antimicrobial activity, but depending on the circumstanc-es may have \u201cstatic\u201d activity directed to agents that inhib-it growth (bacteriostatic, fungistatic and sporostatic), and also \u201ccidal\u201d activity directed to agents that completely de-stroy all microorganisms present (bactericidal, sporocidal, fungicidal). The antiseptics are chemicals that are safely used for disinfection of skin and mucous membrane con-tact (McDonnell and Russell, 1999).Intra-hospital or nosocomial infections are caused by organisms acquired during hospitalization of the patients and clinically manifest from 48 to 72 hours after their ad-ministration (Rutala et al., 2008).Mechanical cleaning before applying the disinfectant is essential. The mechanism of action of disinfectants is summarized in a number of papers published and avail-able to the entire scientific community. For example, al-cohols show quick action, and broad spectrum antimicro-bial activity through denaturation of proteins, but do not act sporocidal. Aldehydes bind with amino groups of pro-teins, RNA and DNA. Oxidizing agents such as peroxides and halogen elements oxidize the protein thiol groups, and surface active agents act mainly on the cytoplasmic mem-brane of the bacterial cell. Phenols generally destroy the cell membrane (Block, 2001).It is well known that the type and quantity of used dis-infectant and the disinfection procedures is directly related to the effects of their use (Ducel et al., 2002).The aim of this study was to review of the use of an-tiseptics and disinfectants in general hospital in Gevgelija in Republic of Macedonia over five years period, to make analysis of the amount of antiseptics and disinfectants con-sumed annually on each department in hospitals, to ana-lyze of the total amount of consumed antiseptics and dis-infectants in selected hospitals for five years and to com-pare the results to the data obtained from the microbiolog-ical evaluations conducted periodically in each department in selected hospitals for five years.Materials and methodsThe data were collected from the general hospital in Gevgelija over five years, form 2010 till 2014. The data from the annual reports for disinfectants and antiseptics (Bactosal, Ecosal 10%, Ecosal ultra, Dezintal, Betadine 10%, Betadine 7,5%, Hydrogen peroxide 30%, Formalde-hyde 33%, Ethanol concentrate, Gigazyme, Deconex 36 Intensiv, Gigasept forte AF, Gigasept FF, Gigasept PAA, Deconex 54 Sporocide, Microzid AF liquid, Arcana alca combi, Plivasept, Arcana san, Arcana anti fat) used on the selected departments (gynecology, surgery, transfusion, treatment of infections, internal medicine etc.) were col-lected. The results of microbiological testing conducted by the public health center in Gevgelija over five years were S2 PP 69156Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 155 - 156 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationscollected and used. Routine testing period for microbiolog-ical controls in hospitals was 15 days.Results and discussionThe obtained data are getting an overview of the disin-fectants and antiseptics used in the departments each year. It can be concluded that the highest consumption is in the operating room. The reason for this is that there are used all cleaning tools for disinfection of surfaces and instru-ments and antiseptics. Reduction of use of disinfectants and antiseptics in surgery room would cause much higher risk for intra-hospital infections. The highest amount (227 l) in the operating room is wasted in 2012. The lowest con-sumed amount of antiseptics and disinfectants was in men-tal health center and center for addicts. To determine the relationship between the amount of used antiseptics and disinfectants with the emergence of intra-hospital infections, in addition the data obtained by the microbiological analysis in public health center in Gevgelija were processed. In 2012 a total of 27 inspections were conducted, 156 swabs and sediments were taken, 147 were sterile and 9 conditionally pathogenic. The reason for the reduced number of isolated patho-gens was increased amount of antiseptics and disinfectants used during 2012. From children\u2019s department and neona-tology, all taken swabs were sterile. From surgical opera-tion room, 2 pathogen samples were detected. In the rest of the surgical department, 2 pathogenic bacteria are isolated: Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus albus, but they have been isolated from patient beds and hands which is normal findings. Comparing to 2011 when they were isolated 6 conditionally pathogenic samples at the gy-necology department; in 2012 the number of conditional-ly pathogenic samples was reduced to 2. At dialysis, a to-tal number of swabs taken was 16 and 3 of them were con-ditionally pathogenic.It is detected that the number of conditionally patho-genic bacteria is reduced starting from 2012. The reduction of the quantity of disinfectant used is also noted from 2012. By appointment of Ministry of health in 2012 each hospi-tal had been established the intra-hospital infection times. The results indicate a significant reduction of contamina-tion with conditionally pathogenic bacteria when disinfec-tion is conducted according to the standardized procedures controlled by the intra-hospital infection times.ConclusionIn general the disinfectants and antiseptics are used optimally and correctly according to the needs of the hos-pital investigated. The amount of disinfectants and antisep-tics consumed comparing with the microbiological data in-dicates their rational utilization starting from 2012. Use of disinfectants according to the standardized procedures es-tablished by the intra-hospital infection time allows current daily care for patients and staff in the hospital investigated. The processed data from public health center confirm the above and point out the precautions to be taken when con-ditionally pathogenic bacteria have been detected. It is pointed out the role of intra-hospital infection times in the hospitals as well as the role of hospital phar-macists. We would like to suggest the implementation of disinfection process validation as standardization measure as well as more often routine microbiological controls in the hospitals.ReferencesBlock, S.

As for a cosmet-ic purpose, caffeine is used as an active compound in an-ti-cellulite products. Cellulite deposition is one of the most common problems associated with a large population male and female person throughout the world. Caffeine prevents an excessive accumulation of fats and promotes the lipol-ysis process. It inhibits phosphodiesterases, which leads to lipogenesis reduction. Caffeine also stimulates the drain-ing lymph systems in fatty tissue by removing accumu-lated fat and toxins, which can improve the microcircu-lation of blood vessels (Herman and Herman, 2013). The commercially available topical anti-cellulite formulations usually contain 1-2% of caffeine, although some products may contain up to 3% of caffeine (Hexsel and Soirefmann, 2011). There are number of papers about caffeine determina-tion in different food products, but limited works which describe caffeine determination in cosmetics (Injac et al., 2008; Marchei et al., 2013). Cosmetics are complex for-mulations and for their analysis different and lengthy sam-ple treatments are required. Sample preparation and clean-up are crucial, especially for the HPLC analysis, where the sample solutions are directly injected to HPLC column. Also, anti-cellulite gels and creams contain a wide variety of synthetic and natural (plant-derived) substances which may interfere with the caffeine determination. Solid phase extraction (SPE) is useful for sample preparation and clean-up in the analysis of pharmaceutical creams. It is more rap-id and efficient than liquid/liquid extraction, yields quanti-tative extractions that are easy to perform without using of high volumes of toxic organic solvents. In this study, a solid phase-extraction method followed by HPLC with ultraviolet-diode array detection to deter-mine of caffeine content in anti-cellulite gels was devel-oped. Materials and methodsCaffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) of analytical grade was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). The sol-vent used, methanol, was of HPLC grade (J.T.Baker). For the sample preparation ethanol (95-96%, Ph.Eur.V, Zorka-Pharma, Serbia) was used. Stock solution of caffeine con-centration of 1.0 mg/mL was prepared in deionized water. This solution was stored for up to one week at 4 \u00b0C.Working solutions were prepared by diluting and mixing the stock with deionized water.Cellulite reduction cosmetics were obtained from a local perfumery. Two products were analyzed: Producer 1-Aqua Destock and Anticelulit gel-Producer 2. Both prod-ucts contain caffeine in significant amount, and many syn-thetic substances and plant extracts also. The exact content of caffeine was not declared.   Solid-phase extraction Chromabond\u00aeHR-X cartridg-es (100 mg, 1 mL volume, Macherey-Nagel, Germany) were selected as optimal for the clean-up and extraction of caffeine from anti-cellulite gels. SPE cartridges were con-ditioned with 3 mL of methanol and 3 mL of deionized wa-ter. One milliliter of the prepared sample was loaded on the cartridge at the flow rate of 1 mL/min. Desorption of caf-feine was achieved with 4 x 1 mL of methanol. HPLC analyses were performed on the Agilent Tech-nologies 1200 Series apparatus with DAD and FL detec-tion. Separation was carried out on the Restek Ultra IBD S2 PP 70158Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 157 - 158 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsC18 column (150 mm x 3 mm, 3 \u03bcm) at 30 \u00b0C. The mobile phase consisted of a methanol-water solution (40:60, isocratic) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. A 2 \u03bcL of the final eluate was injected in the HPLC column. UV detection at 274 nm was used as the optimal wavelength for caffeine determination.Sample preparation A 0.5 g of the gel was accurately weighed and dis-solved in 10 mL of 95-96% ethanol. NH4OH was added to obtain pH 7-8. Insoluble excipients were separated by cen-trifugation for 10 min. Then, 1 mL of the supernatant was loaded on the cartridge and SPE procedure was performed. Results and discussionOptimization of SPE procedure included cartridge se-lection, solvent selection and recovery evaluation. To eval-uate the accuracy of the extraction method, recovery stud-ies were carried out. A known amount of caffeine standard solution, at three different concentration levels was ex-tracted on different cartridges and recovery was calculated as the ratio of the loaded and eluted caffeine. The percent-age extraction recovery was found to be 82-90% for the Chromabond\u00aeHR-X cartridge, while for the other types of cartridges this value was significantly lower. After the pro-cedure of gel preparation, the obtained supernatants were also loaded on different SPE cartridges. The highest chro-matographic peak purity, peak area and concentration lev-els of caffeine were also obtained for Chromabond\u00aeHR-X cartridge. For that reason, this type of cartridge was select-ed for the extraction and clean-up of the examined anti-cel-lulite gels.The caffeine content in the examined samples was determined by using the calibration curve in the range of 0.01-0.2 mg/mL. The caffeine concentration found in Pro-ducer 1-Aqua Destock was 1.70 g/100 g (1.70%), while the value for Anticelulit gel-Producer 2 was 0.69 g/100 g (0.69%). The found content of caffeine in investigated cel-lulite reduction cosmetics were in agreement with those re-ported by other authors (Injac et al., 2008; Marchei et al., 2013). and with the expected values.ConclusionThe most effective and marketed products for cellulite reduction contain caffeine as the active ingredient, but its exact content in these products is not strictly declared.  The extraction step is necessary for the analysis of caffeine in anti-cellulite gels by chromatographic methods. Because of the fact that caffeine is contained in the complex cosmetic matrix, its extraction is difficult and depends on the nature of the sample. A purification of the cosmetics and extrac-tion of the analyte can be achieved by using SPE technique.The present results show the applicability of the pro-posed SPE procedure for the caffeine extraction from anti-cellulite gels and its HPLC determination, which could be used for the routine analysis of these commercial products.

D, Blvd. A. Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, R.Macedonia2Pharmachem Diagnostic Laboratory, Str. 4th July No 2/3, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* epopovska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionBacterial endotoxins are contaminants from gram-neg-ative bacteria and are the most common cause of pyroge-nicity in pharmaceutical products. Any preparation admin-istered parenterally should be sterile and comply with the test for bacterial endotoxins (BET) as described in the Ph. Eur. (Ph. Eur., 2014). Finished products often contain in-gredients in addition to the active drug substance. Excipi-ents serve as a solvents, solubilizing, suspending, thicken-ing, and chelating agents; antioxidants, antimicrobial pre-servatives, buffers, pH adjusting agents, bulking agents, and special additives (British Pharmacopoeia, 2014; CHMP, 2013; ICH, 2009; Ph Eur., 2014).Benzyl alcohol is an aromatic alcohol with the formu-la C7H8O. In the body, benzyl alcohol is metabolised into benzoic acid. It is used as an excipient for its preserva-tive properties or as a solubilising agent. Benzyl alcohol is also used as an active ingredient in local antiseptics and lo-cal anesthetic products. It is also present in medical prod-ucts administered intravenously (anti-cancer drugs, hepa-rins, cardiovascular drugs) and as a preservative in many topical preparations, such as antifungal and anti-inflamma-tory products (Ph.Eur., 2014). However benzyl alcohol is mainly used as an excipient in medicinal products that are administered intramuscularly, such as antibiotics, anti-in-flammatory or neuroleptic medicines where its anesthetic properties reduce pain at the injection site. Objective: Validation and quantifications of Bacterial endotoxins with Turbidimetric kinetic method, for benzyl alcohol.  Materials and methodsBenzyl alcohol (Merck Certified; Merck KGaA, Darm-stadt, Germany); Reagents for Kinetic turbidrimetric meth-od: PYROGENT\u2122- 5000, LAL Reagent Water, and Py-rosperse\u2122 Dispersing Agent, one of a group of metallo-modified polyanionic dispersants which has proven useful as a sample modifying agent for certain types of products showing inhibition in the BET assay from Lonza (Lonza Group Ltd, Walkersville, MD21793), along with  Micro-plate reader ELx808 from BIO-TEK\u00ae (BIO-TEK Instru-ments, INC.,P.O.BOX998, Hghlsand Park, Winooski, Ver-mont 05404 USA). The results were calculated and stored with WinKQCL 4.0.2 software\u2122 (Lonza Group Ltd, Walk-ersvilleThe Kinetic turbidrimetric method is based on mea-suring the turbidity (optical density) of an LAL/sample mixture at regular interval troughout the test. The time re-quired before the appearance of turbidity (Reaction time) is inversely proportional to the amount of endotoxin present. In accordance with the Ph. Eur. Commission at its 149th Session, June 2014: Substances to be used in par-enteral preparations must comply with the BET, whatever their origin, since:- contamination by bacterial endotoxins can take place prior to or during the manufacturing process;- bacterial endotoxins cannot easily be removed by the manufacturing process;- bacterial endotoxins should be detected as early as possible in the manufacturing process.It is to be noted that the ICH Guideline Q6B: Specifi-cations: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Bio-technological/Biological Products provides the following recommendation under section Drug Substance Specifi-cation: \u201cPharmacopoeial tests (e.g., endotoxin detection) S2 PP 71160Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 159 - 160 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsshould be performed on the drug substance, where appro-priate\u201d.Benzyl alcohol, as an excipient in parenteral prepa-rations, has strongly inhibitory effect on Bacterial endo-toxins test (Kinetic Turbidimetric method) when diluted with LAL reagent water (LRW). It is necessary to over-come the inhibition and for that purpose 2% solution of Py-rosperse\u2122 Dispersing Agent from Lonza was used in com-bination with laboratory techniques: shake 30min, vortex 30sec. and centrifuge 3min. (3000rpm/min), (British Phar-macopoeia, 2014; EMA, 2013; FDA, 2012; Ph.Eur., 2014; Thomas et al., 1984)Results and discussionValidation was performed by beginning with screen-ing (Inhibition / Enhancement) test. For that purpose PY-ROGENT\u2122- 5000, Lonza\u2019s reagents were used; lysate sensitivity  \u03bb = 0,01 EU/mL; maximum valid dilution (MVD) = ELC/\u03bb = 2.5 / 0.01 = 250. Most products in-terfere with the performance of the BET. The easiest way to overcome interference is to dilute the product in LRW. Dilutions used for preliminary, Inhibition / Enhancement test were as follows: 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128 and the MVD 1:250. All dilutions were made with LRW (FDA, 2012; Ph.Eur., 2014; McCullough, 2011; Williams, 2009). Benzyl alcohol shows strong inhibition includ-ing MVD. To overcome the inhibition new dilutions were made. For the first dilution 1:10, as a solvent 2% solution of Pyrosperse\u2122 Dispersing Agent, from Lonza was used, shaked for 30 min, vortexend for 30 sec and centrifuged 3 min (3000 rpm/min). Tested dilutions: 1:50, 1:100 and 1:200 were made from the aqueous part of the first dilu-tion. Aqueous part was used for analysis. There was an in-hibition only at 1:50 dilution, PPC recovery: not applicable (N/A). The inhibition was overcomed at 1:100 and 1:200 dilution which gave PPC recovery 73% and 115% respec-tively (Lonza Group Ltd, Walkersville; Ph.Eur., 2014). Upon received results the validation further was done on three consecutive batches of benzyl alcohol with di-lution 1:200 (considering that recovery must be close to 100%). The endotoxin concentration reported for the three consecutive batches was less than 2.00 EU/ml with PPC 115%, 149% and 151% respectively. All three batches of the tested benzyl alcohol showed endotoxin recovery be-tween 50 and 200%.ConclusionValidation of the Bacterial endotoxins test on Benzyl alcohol was successfully done. The inhibition was over-come. Further, routine testing of Benzyl alcohol should be done with dilution 1:200 using Pyrosperse\u2122 Dispersing Agent from Lonza, shaking for 30 min, vortexing for 30 sec and centrifuge 3 min (3000 rpm/min) in accordance with the method developed.ReferencesBacterial endotoxins Ph.

Many of the anti-anxiety medicines also cause some sedation, so the same medicine is of-ten functioning clinically as both, anxiolytic and hypnot-ic agent. Benzodiazepines are the most widely used anx-iolytic medicines. They have largely replaced barbiturates in the treatment of anxiety, because the benzodiazepines are safer and more effective. Anxiety is an unpleasant state of tension, apprehension, a fear that seems to arise from a sometimes unknown source. The physical symptoms of severe anxiety are similar to those of fear (such as tachy-cardia, sweating, trembling, and palpitations) and involve sympathetic activation. Episodes of mild anxiety are com-mon life experiences and do not warrant treatment. How-ever, the symptoms of severe, chronic, debilitating anxi-ety may be treated with antianxiety medicines (sometimes called anxiolytic or minor tranquilizers) and/or some form of behavioral or psychotherapy.Bromazepam is a benzodiazepine (BZD) generally used for a number of medical reasons, it is an intermidi-ate-acting tranquiliser (Ashton, 2005), prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks for the short-term treatment of insomnia. It has been wide-ly used in psychiatry disorders for four decades, with selec-tive anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myorelaxant and hypnotic actions. It acts on the central neural system as an inhibitor of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Nascimento et al., 2012).Bromazepam is an active substance that belongs to class of 1,4-benzodiazepine and chemically corresponds to 7-bromo-1,3-dihydro-5-(2-pyridyl)-2H-1,4-benzodi-azepine-2-one, C14H10BrN3O (Ph.Eur., 2010). It is a con-trolled psychotropic substance-B1 class according to the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance in Brazil (ANVI-SA), with the DCB identification numbers: 01366, DCI: 2692 and CAS: 1812-20-2. The solid dosage form (tablet) is the widespread used and prescribed in clinical practice. The solid dosage form presents problems associated to the bioavailability (FDA, 2003).  The absorption of active sub-stance from the solid dosage form for oral application de-pends on the solubility and dissolution in physiologic liq-uids and its permeability through the gastrointestinal tract, factors that influence directly its bioavailability and sub-sequent pharmacological effects. The biotransformation from solid into absorbable form depends on its dissolution in organic liquids; therefore, dissolution tests became an essential parameter to determine the properties of biophar-maceutical formulations in order to predict their quality. The quality of pharmaceutical formulations is important in financial and ethical terms because it is directly associat-ed with the patient\u2019s health. Thus, there is a real need for the development of dissolution tests able to predict in vivo physiological conditions.Materials and methodsDissolution test is a standardized method for measur-ing the rate of active substance release from a dosage form (FDA, 1997).  The test was performed on ERWEKA DT 700, apparatus 2 (paddle), using 0.1 M HCl as a dissolu-S2 PP 72162Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 161 - 162 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationstion medium, in volume of 500 ml, at 37\u00b0C, with 75 rpm for 45 minutes.The quantity of the dissolved bromazepam was deter-mined using analytical method based on High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Validation of the method was performed on Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system.To optimize chromatographic parameters several mo-bile phase compositions were tested in this method. A sat-isfactory separation, good peak symmetry and optimal re-tention time was obtained using mobile phase consisting of a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and potassium di-hydrogen phosphate buffer (11.33 g/l of KH2PO4, pH 7.0 adjusted with KOH, 0.5 M) in ratio of 45:5:50 (v/v/v), at flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. A LiChrospher RP Select B col-umn (125 \u00d7 4.0 mm, 5\u03bcm) was used as stationary phase with temperature of column oven, 50 \u00b0C. The elution was monitored at 239 nm.Results and discussionA simple reverse phase HPLC method for in vitro dis-solution test was developed and validated for the determi-nation of bromazepam and its release from pharmaceutical dosage form. Several high-performance liquid chromato-graphic (HPLC) methods have also been reported for the determination of bromazepam and other BZDs (Sruthi et al., 2013).  Chromatogram showed a peak of bromazepam (BZP) at retention time of 3.50 \u00b1 0.1 min. The most suit-able mobile phase was selected on the basis of time re-quired for the analysis and the sensitivity of the method. The method was validated according to ICH Q2 guideline with respect to specificity, linearity (with correlation coef-ficient of 0.999), accuracy, precision, robustness, solution stability and filter paper compatibility. All results of the validation parameters were within the limits of ICH guide-lines (ICH, 2005). The benefits of the proposed method in-clude simple preparation of the solutions for the analysis and usage of readily available solvents. ConclusionThe proposed method is simple, rapid, accurate, pre-cise and specific without interference of excipients. The short chromatographic run time allows the analysis of a large number of samples in short period of time. There-fore, it is suitable for the routine analysis of bromazepam in pharmaceutical dosage forms and it could be used for the rapid and reliable determination of dissolved bromaze-pam in tablet formulations. The present study was focused on minimizing method limitations and developing a simple and economic method for determination of dissolved bro-mazepam from tablet dosage form.ReferencesAshton, H., 2005.

Macedonia* arlindahaxhiu@gmail.comIntroductionThe goal of antiepileptic drugs (AED) therapy for peo-ple with epilepsy is seizure freedom without side effects (Va-jda, 2007). In the last decade, several new AEDs have been licensed around the world (Krasowski, 2010). Considering the variable nature of epilepsy, patient\u2019s pathophysiologi-cal features, co-medications, AED therapy must be careful-ly optimized for each patient by the aid of therapeutic mon-itoring (TDM), concerning both therapeutic and toxicolog-ical profiles. In many cases TDM facilitates drug treatment by increasing clinical effectiveness and safety while mini-mizing adverse effects, as well as reducing treatment costs. The availability of a simple, validated and inexpensive ana-lytical method for reliable measurements of drug concentra-tions in biological fluids is pivotal for its successful utiliza-tion in pharmacokinetic and bioequivalence studies, and for therapeutic drug monitoring in different clinical situations. Various analytical methods have been reported for measure-ment of AEDs in biological fluids, including immunoassays and chromatographic methods (gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography). Immunoanaly-sis techniques are specifically designed to analyze a single drug but the chromatographic methods can allow for the si-multaneous separation and quantitation of many compounds in a single run which is important when is need the simulta-neously monitoring the AEDs in polytherapy, which is giv-en very common to patients (Aldaz et al., 2011)The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive and fast bioanalytical method for simultaneous determine the plasma concentration of recent old and new AEDs used in the current clinic practice: lamotrigine (LTG), leveti-racetame (LEV), carbamazepine (CBZ), the active metab-olite carbamazepine -10,11-epoxide (CBZ-EP) and valpro-ic acid (VPA). Materials and methodsChemicals and reagentsLTG, LEV, CBZ, CBZ-EP, VPA and nitrazepam (in-ternal standard,IS), were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, USA. Methanol and acetonitrile, HPLC grade, were pur-chased from Merck, Germany. Potassium dihydrogen phosphate and phosphoric acid for buffer preparation were analytical grade and were also obtained from Merck, Ger-many. For all analyses HPLC grade water purified with a TKA_LAB Reinstwasser system (Niederelbert, Germany) was used. OASIS HLB cartridges (30 mg/1 ml) used for sample preparation were supplied by Waters, USA.Human plasma samplingPlasma was collected from healthy volunteers (drug-free plasma for the method validation) and from the epilep-tic patients undergoing chronic AEDs therapy. Blood sam-ples were collected in the morning, just before the first dai-ly drug administration, into heparinized tubes and centri-fuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant plasma was transferred into test tubes and frozen at -20 \u00b0C until analy-sis. The Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Pharmacy and the Faculty of Medicine, Ss. Cyril and Methodius Univer-sity - Skopje, approved the research protocol for this study S2 PP 73164Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 163 - 164 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsand all volunteers signed the Study Informed Consent form. Chromatographic conditionsThe assay was performed on Shimadzu LC-30 Nexera, using Zorbax Eclipse XDB C-18 (150 x 4.6 mm; 5 \u00b5m) col-umn, using gradient elution with acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (pH 3.0), as a mobile phase. The analyses were run at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, volume of injection 50 \u00b5L, temper-ature 25 \u00baC and UV detection was set at 210 nm. Experimental design (Fractional factorial 34) was used for the optimization of chromatographic conditions. The influence of four experimental factors (pH of buffer solu-tion in the mobile phase, initial and final content of ace-tonitrile in mobile phase during gradient elution and the gradient time) was investigated at three factor levels. All remaining factors such as the flow rate of mobile phase, wavelength of UV detection, temperature of the column and volume of injection were kept at constant level. The method was validated according to the EMA Guideline on validation of bioanalytical method (EMA, 2011). Preparation of standards and quality control standardsStock solution of analytes (500 \u00b5g mL LTG, 500 \u00b5g/mL LEV, 500 \u00b5g/mL CBZ, 500 \u00b5g/mL VPA, 200 \u00b5g/mL CBZ-EP) and the IS (500 \u00b5g/mL ) were prepared by dis-solving appropriate amounts of each compound in metha-nol. Working solutions were prepared daily from stock so-lutions by dilution with purified water. Calibration stan-dards were made by spiking the blank plasma aliquots with appropriate volume of working solutions of LTG, LEV, CBZ, VPA and CBZ-EP at 7 different concentrations con-taining the IS at constant concentration 10 \u00b5g/ml. The re-sulting plasma concentration ranges were: 1.0 - 25.0 \u00b5g/mL (LTG); 3.0 -70.0 \u00b5g/mL (LEV); 1.0 - 25.0 \u00b5g/mL (CBZ); 0.5 -15.0 \u00b5g/mL (CBZ-EP); 25.0 - 250 \u00b5g/mL (VPA). Four levels of quality control (QC) samples were prepared at the concentration range of: 1.0; 5.0; 10.0; 20.0 \u00b5g/ml for LTG; 3.0; 7.5; 30.0; 60.0 \u00b5g/ml for LEV; 1.0; 5.0; 10.0; 20.0 \u00b5g/ml for CBZ; 0.5; 2.5; 5.0; 10.0 \u00b5g/ml for CBZ-EP and 25.0; 100; 150; 200 \u00b5g/ml for VPA, in same way as de-scribe above and stored at - 20 \u00baC until analysis.Sample preparation The sample preparation step is an important compo-nent of bioanalytical method i.e determination of plasma concentration of AEDs. To find the most efficient method, sample pre-tretment methodology was initially investigat-ed by protein precipitation (PP) and than a solid- phase ex-traction (SPE) using Oasis \u00ae HLB cartridges.Results and discussionUnder the proposed chromatographic conditions, no interfering peaks were observed in the retention times of analytes. Calibration curves were constructed by means of the least-squares method, obtained by plotting the analyte - IS peak area ratios versus the respective analyte concen-trations. The correlation coefficients were 0.9989 for LTG, 0.9979 for LEV, 0.9986 for CBZ, 0.9978 for CBZ-EP and 0.9978 for VPA, respectively. The results for within-run and between-run accuracy and precision were within rec-ommended limits. The pretreatment of plasma samples by protein precipitation, gave no profitable results because the processed samples were relatively unclean with low recov-ery. Since SPE procedures are usually associated to high and reliable extraction of AEDs from human plasma, sev-eral SPE conditions were tested, including washing steps and eluting solvents. The use of SPE procedure (loaded a 200 \u00b5L of sample, washing with 1ml water and 1 ml 5% methanol and eluting with methanol) demonstrated to be the best option as it allowed a more effective elimination of interfering substances with good recoveries. The abso-lute mean recoveries for determined AEDS and metabo-lite ranged from 85.2% to 99.6% while mean recovery of IS was 98.9% for SPE. The stability studies analytes indi-cate that stock solutions and plasma samples were stable under different storage conditions and that no stability re-lated problems would be expected during the routine plas-ma sample analysis.The proposed method gives satisfactory results when was applied to plasma samples collected from epileptic pa-tients simultaneously treated with carbamazepine and le-vetiracetame; lamotrigine and valproate; or in combination levetiracetame, lamotrigine and carbamazepine. ConclusionA simple, sensitive, precise and accurate HPLC meth-od has been developed for simultaneous determination of LEV, LTG, CBZ, CBZ-EP and VPA in human plasma sam-ples. Time of analysis and resolution were simultaneously optimized by applying Fractional factorial 34 design. To-tal chromatographic analysis time per sample was approx-imately 15 min. The proposed method can be applied suc-cessfully in routine analysis for the estimation of therapeu-tic concentration of LEV, LTG, CBZ, CBZ-EP and VPA in human plasma.ReferencesAldaz, A., Ferriols, R., Aumente, D., Calvo, M.V., Farre, M.R., Garcia,m B., Marques, R., Mas, P., Porta, B., Outeda, M., Soy, D., 2011.

These data form the basis for justifying specification limits (Huynh-Ba, 2008). The stability data, combined with the specification limits, are used for setting and/or extending product shelf life and for establishing product storage conditions. Stability studies are initiated annually and may be used to support product or process modifications (ICH, 2003). These studies are vital for ensuring the continuous quality of production batches. In order to identify potential issues and to ensure data quality, it is often advantageous to use objective and statistical methods for trend analysis of stability data. The presented paper describes trending of stability results for pharmaceutical product Caffetin Cold film coated tablets. This paper will provide an overview of one statistical approach for trending stability results. According to ICH Q1E guideline (ICH, 2003), evaluation of the stability data, after the assessment of the shelf life, should progress through the trends and variability of the long-term stability data (Yoshioka and Stella, 2000). The evaluation of stability data (not necessary statistical) is done in order to identify the trends and their impact on the stability of the product (Yoshioka and Stella, 2000).Materials and methodsIn order to evaluate stability data and find the pattern of data that indicates change over time, stability studies for Caffetin Cold film coated tablets were subjected to trend analysis. The trending analysis was performed to evaluate whether the data demonstrates increasing or decreasing trend (change of mean) for the stability indicating parameters over time or the data indicates no discernible change at all. In order to evaluate trends and variability of the long-term stability data, we evaluated three stability indicating parameters: assay, dissolution rate and related and degradation products. In order to assess the trend of the parameters Paracetamol assay, Paracetamol dissolution rate, Dextromethorphan assay, Dextromethorphan dissolution rate, Pseudoephedrine assay, Pseudoephedrine dissolution rate, Ascorbic acid assay, Ascorbic acid dissolution rate and related and degradation products, we collected all the stability data obtained for this parameters through the years and graphically presented them. The results are presented both as a table and as a graph.Results and discussionCaffetin Cold film coated tablets is a pharmaceutical product with long manufacturing history with the same manufacturing route, on the same manufacturing site and following described manufacturing procedure in Alkaloid AD, Skopje and with well-established stability. Ongoing stability studies in Alkaloid AD, Skopje are performed on one batch annually for long term stability testing, including the batches from years of 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.Evaluation was conducted using one common statistical graph (scatter plotting of the results) in order to compare the obtained results. The obtained results were S2 PP 74166Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 165 - 166 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsincorporated into respective trends. The suitable trends for all stability indicated parameters were defined from the collected stability data. The evaluation of stability data was conducted in non-statistical way in order to identify the trends.Parameters such as Paracetamol assay, Paracetamol dissolution rate, Dextromethorphan dissolution rate, Pseudoephedrine dissolution rate and Ascorbic acid dissolution rate indicate no discernible change. All the results retain almost constant around the initial result value. Results for this investigated parameter remain within the shelf-life requirements.  Parameters Dextromethorphan assay and Ascorbic acid assay indicate mild decreasing trend, but results remain within the limits for shelf life specification. Parameter Pseudoephedrine assay indicate a trend in which a single result within a batch is resulting in atypical trend compared to the other batches. This situation shows a single atypical result within a study that cannot yet form a trend and needs further investigation in the following frequencies of testing (in order to avoid false alarm). For all other collected data we find that they indicate mild decreasing trend, but results remain within the limits for shelf life specification. Parameters 4-aminophenol, unknown impurity and total impurities indicate no discernible change.Parameter Paracetamol assay indicates no discernible change. All results retain almost constant around the initial result value. Results for investigated parameter Paracetamol assay remain within the shelf-life requirements. Parameter Paracetamol dissolution rate indicates no discernible change. All the results retain almost constant around the initial result value. Results for investigated parameter Paracetamol dissolution rate remain within the shelf-life requirements.  Parameter Dextromethorphan assay indicates mild decreasing trend, but the results remain within the limits for shelf life specification. Parameter Dextromethorphan dissolution rate indicates no discernible change. All the results retain almost constant around the initial result value. Results for investigated parameter Dextromethorphan dissolution rate remain within the shelf-life requirements. Parameter Pseudoephedrine dissolution rate indicates no discernible change. All the results retain almost constant around the initial result value. Results for investigated parameter Pseudoephedrine dissolution rate remain within the shelf-life requirements. Parameter Pseudoephedrine assay indicate a trend in which a single result within a batch is resulting in atypical trend compared to the other batches. This situation shows a single atypical result within a study that cannot yet form a trend and needs further investigation in the following frequencies of testing (in order to avoid false alarm).

Parameter Ascorbic acid assay indicates mild decreasing trend, but results remain within the limits for shelf life specification. Parameter Ascorbic acid dissolution rate indicate no discernible change. All the results retain almost constant around the initial result value. Results for investigated parameter Ascorbic acid dissolution rate remain within the shelf-life requirements. Parameters 4-aminophenol, unknown impurity and total impurities indicate no discernible change.ConclusionFrom the presented results it could be observed that the parameters assay, dissolution rate and related and degradation products, considered as critical quality attributes, reveal very similar profile for all batches tested at the same conditions. The results of all batches follow a trend suggesting that there is no statistically significant difference in parameters trends.ReferencesHuynh-Ba, K., 2008.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* marjan.dzeparoski@bionikapharm.comIntroductionMacedonia and Serbia fully follow EU regulation of medicines. Herbal medicines in Macedonia are regulated by the Law on Medicines and Medical Devices (2007) and the Regulation on the registration of traditional herbal me-dicinal products from 2008. Serbia also follows EU legis-lation. Laws on Medicines in Macedonia and Serbia are harmonized with the EU regulation of medicines.Macedonia follows EU legislation for food supple-ments. The products are regulated by the special require-ments for safety of food supplements from 2012 (Official Gazzette of Republic of Serbia no. 45/10, 27/11; 50/12), and the Rulebook amending the Rulebook on special re-quirements for food supplements from 2013 and 2015 (Of-ficial Gazzette of Republic of Serbia, no. 41/13), and in compliance with the Croatian Rulebook on food supple-ments in terms of their classification from 2013. Serbia also follows EU legislation, but has not implemented and do not follow the Regulation on nutrition and health claims, novel food regulation procedures and the law on using symbols on packaging and packaging waste. For food supplements, indications and properties that are not possessed should not be attributed (Dzeparoski, 2013; Kotler, 1989; Kotler and Keler, 2009). The main goal of this paper was to make comparative analysis of advertising and promotion of the product Sen-tis by the company Bionika Pharmaceuticals in Macedonia and Serbia. The marketing campaigns, TV spots and inter-net advertisement have been analyzed. The choice of the countries is based upon different product categorization in which Sentis is classified.Materials and methodsComparative method for analyzing the regulation, ad-vertising and promotion of the food supplements and tradi-tional herbal medicines was used.Results and discussionCase studySentis is a natural sedative in the form of soft gela-tin capsules containing 200 mg of extract of valerian root (Valeriana Officinalis). In Macedonia Sentis is registered in 2012 as traditional herbal medicine (THM), while in Serbia is registered as a food supplement in 2013. Valeri-an root has been used since ancient times before the exis-tence of synthetic sedatives. The action is due to valeren-ic acid; experimental pharmacological studies have shown that it reduces motility, causing hypnotic activity, offset-ting the effect of caffeine and improves coordination. In both countries registered indications are temporary relieve of the symptoms of nervous tension, stress and insomnia. Benefits are unlike synthetic sedatives, it does not cause drowsiness and dependence (Bionika, 2013; PDR, 2007; WHO, 1999).The differences regarding dosing and indications, re-sulting from the different classification of the same prod-uct are as follows:- dosing registered as THM in Macedonia is 4 x 200 mg, while as food supplement in Serbia maximum daily dose is decreased to 2 x 200 mg;- -indications are the same in both countries, ex-cept that in Macedonia additionally is registered the sedative effect. S2 PP 75168Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 167 - 168 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsThese differences concern advertising and promotion-al activities. In Macedonia and Serbia same package in green and stylized cubist design of flowers and brain with minimal-istic look is used. The text on the package and the patient leaflets are different in accordance with the categoriza-tion, in correlation with the specific regulation. For THM it is written clearly that it is medicine without prescription, with specific 6 line content structure of the patient leaflet and indications based on traditional use. For the food sup-plement is clearly stated that the product is food supple-ment and also ingredients, nutrition and energetic values must be printed on the package, whereas the leaflet and claims are not obligatory. In Serbia the food supplement Sentis is sold with leaflet which contains claims.Internet is universal and powerful digital marketing tool in promotion of company products, including compa-ny web-sites. The content of websites also varies in differ-ent countries.Promotional materials are with similar text content and same design in both countries, except the statement that it is THM or food supplement. The other difference for the THM is also that \u201cthe patient leaflet should be read, for more information you should consult your pharmacist or doctor\u201c. The last is valid for all forms of advertisement. TV spot for Sentis as THM has been approved for ad-vertising in electronic media to the general public by the Ministry of Health. The message which should remain in the subconscious of the audience is that when you use Sen-tis the life will be without anxiety, stress, carefree, without worries and the consumer will continue on with life. TV spot for Sentis as food supplement in Serbia is from infor-mative character. It is not necessary approval for advertis-ing, because is based on generally accepted scientific data and they are comprehensible to the average consumer. In Serbia should be submitted for approval only health claims for reducing the risk of disease. The message which should remain in the subconscious of the audience is that it is a natural product for healthy people, which if used will help reduce certain symptoms. Except promoting the product, with both advertise-ments is also promoted the new pharmaceutical company. TV advertising in Macedonia with a strong and distinctive message, along with the promotion activities, helped the company to achieve significant market share in this seg-ment. Marketing of products by companies should be in accordance with the current country regulation for specif-ic product category.ConclusionThere are major differences in the marketing of THM/OTC and food supplements. All promotional materials for THM to the general public are subject to approval by reg-ulatory bodies, based on the approved summary of product characteristics and patient leaflet. The marketing of food supplements is more liberal in advertising and in Serbia is not subject to approval, if based on generally accepted sci-entific data. Macedonia follows the EU Regulation on nu-trition and health claims for food supplements. The results of the case study can also be used for preparation of mar-keting materials for other products on other markets of in-terest with similar regulation.

This technique differs from the conventional techniques such as HPLC and GC, because the essential component is the sampling interface. That allows for fast, non-destructive measurement of materials with little or no sample preparation. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is used for identification on every container that has been delivered. The principle is based on the comparison of the spectral data of the substance with the spectral data of several samples, which are present in a spectral reference library. These samples have positive chemical/physical and microbiological test analysis, tested in accordance with producer Certificate of Analysis and producer Drug Master File. Positive identification of these samples originally is confirmed with IR Spectrophotometry or other specific identification method. Besides others parameters, these analyses include testing of loss on drying, content of water, optical rotation, related substances and assay that may cause of variables in the NIR spectra. According to the \u201cGuideline on the use of NIR spectroscopy by the pharmaceutical industry and the data requirements for new submission and variations\u201d issued by the European Medicine Agency, when NIR procedures are used for qualitative analysis should be validated for a minimum specificity and robustness (EMA, 2009). For the specificity, independent set of samples is created of different batches, which are not included in the creating of the reference library. All of the samples should be approved correctly (pass). The reference library should be also challenged with relevant structural analogues, which should be rejected (fail). As for robustness, the effects of relevant variables should be understood, tested and documented. Some of the variables include: environmental temperature, humidity, different probe depth, different packaging material, changes in the instrumental method, for example the number of scans. Also instrumental variation can be consider, e.g. changing lamps or reflectance material.Materials and methodsThe NIRS analyses were performed on Thermo Antaris II FT-NIR Analyzer. It is dedicated FT-NIR analyzer designed specifically for use in the industrial environments of the pharmaceutical, food and beverages, chemical and polymer industries (Hirsch, 2008). Some of the characteristics of the instrument are: the detection is performed on high - sensitive, high - stable matched InGaAs; the light source is long - life, high intensity halogen NIR source; the interferometer is frictionless stable, long - life Michelson. The sampling method used is Fiber Optic. NIRS sampling by fiber optics allows rapid point-of-use QC for raw material identification. The Antaris II Fiber Optic module can be used with the SabIR hand - held diffuse reflectance probe which can analyze samples directly or indirectly through packaging materials. The spectral range of SabIR Probe is 12000 \u2013 4000 cm-1. The probe shaft is made of stainless steel, and the window material of the shaft is made is made of high quality, chemical resistance sapphire according to the instrument specification (Antaris II FT-NIR Analyzer).The method that is used in Alkaloid is with SabIR Fiber Optic module. The spectral range in which the collecting is performed is 10000 - 4000 cm-1. The number of scans in 30, and the resolution is 8 cm-1.In the first step of creating the reference library, NIR S2 PP 76170Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 169 - 170 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsspectrum of Ibuprofen Lysine Reference standard was collected. Due to lack of certified reference standard from pharmacopoeia, in \u2013 house standard sent from the suitable manufacturer was used. Further the library was continually updated with samples of commercial batches of Ibuprofen lysine received from the manufacturer.The spectral reference library is composed of spectra collected with direct scanning of the substance and indirect scanning (through the polyethylene bag). In routine, indirect scanning is preferred, by reason of faster scanning and not requiring opening every package. The NIR method for identification of Ibuprofen lysine was validated in terms of Specificity and Robustness, according to the Guideline on the use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) by the pharmaceutical industry and the data requirement for the new submissions and variations, issued by the European Medicine Agency.Results and discussionVerification workflows are created for performance the following tests of specificity and robustness. These workflows are chosen for verification of the production workflow for Ibuprofen lysine.Verification workflow for performing specificityOne verification workflow that contains independent set of three samples, which are batches not included in the reference library are included is created. The results for these samples are PASS. The other verification workflow has three different substances that have similar structure with Ibuprofen Lysine, and therefore is expected to have similar NIR spectrum. That is Ibuprofen, the difference is with the Lysine group; Ketoprofen, belongs to the same group of Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; Paracetamol, together with Ketoprofen, they have similar structure.  The result for Ibuprofen Lysine is PASS, and for the other three substances is FAIL.Verification workflow for robustnessRobustness is performed for testing the effect of minor changes to normal operating conditions on the analysis (Tang, 2012). Verification workflows are created for performance these tests. The parameters for validation robustness of the method, which can affect the method in our operating environment, are the following: change in the number of scans (performed only with indirectly scanning), change in probe depth (performed with direct scanning) and change in thickness of the packaging material (performed with indirect scanning). The results for these three workflow are PASS, which brings the conclusion that certain changes in the method does not affect the test results.  ConclusionThe obtained results confirm that the NIR method for identification of Ibuprofen lysine is verified and appropriate for it use. ReferencesEuropean Medicines Agency, 2009.

Trajkovska, Hristina Babunovska Alkaloid AD - Skopje, Pharmaceutical, chemical and Cosmetics Company, Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* mspasevska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionResidual solvents in pharmaceuticals are defined as organic volatile chemicals that are used or produced in the manufacture of drug substances or excipients, or in the preparation of drug products. The solvents are not completely removed by the manufacturing techniques and therefore it is required appropriate selection of the solvent for the synthesis. The solvent used can enhance the yield, or even determine some of the characteristic of the substances, such as crystal form, purity and solubility (CHMP, 2015). Considering that residual solvents do not provide any therapeutically benefits, they should be removed, to the extent possible, to meet ingredient and product specifications and good manufacturing practices. The residual solvents, based on their toxicity, are divided into three groups. The solvents that are known to cause unacceptable toxicities are class 1. In this group belongs: benzene, carbon tetrachloride; 1,2-dichlorethane; 1,1 - dichlorethene and 1,1,1-trichlorethane. These solvents are proven human carcinogens and environmental hazardous. Considering the unacceptable toxicity, this class of solvents should be avoided during the manufacturing process, unless their use can be strongly justified in a risk-benefit assessment. The Class 2 solvents are associated with less severe toxicity. Some of the solvents that belong to this group are: acetonitrile; chloroform; 1,2-dichlorethene; N,N-dimethylacetamide; N,N-dimethylformamide; 1,4-dioxane; ethylene glycol; formamide; methanol; hexane; pyridine; toluene. The use of these solvents should be limited in order to protect the patients from potential adverse effects. Ideally, less toxic solvents should be used where is possible. Those are solvents that belong to Class 3. They are counted as less toxic and of lower risk to human health then Class 1 and Class 2 residual solvents.  The solvents in this class are not known as a human health hazard at level normally accepted in pharmaceuticals. However there are no long-term toxicity or carcinogenicity studies for many of the residual solvents in Class 3. Available data so far, indicate that they are less toxic in acute or short term studies and negative in genotoxicity studies. Some of the solvents that belong to this group are: acetic acid; acetone; 1-butanol; 2-butanol; dimethyl sulfoxide; ethanol; ethyl acetate; ethyl ether; formic acid (USP, 2015).Residual solvent that was used in the synthesis of sodium citrate is methanol. Since methanol belongs to class 2 residual solvents, quantification should be performed. Materials and methodsThe experiments were performed on Shimadzu 2010 Plus GC instrument. The pressure was set to 9.8 Psi, column flow was 2.08 mL/min and total flow was 15.5 mL/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas. Other gases that were used are Hydrogen and Air. The injection volume was 1000 \u00b5L and the split was 1:5. The column used is DB-624, 30 m x 0.32 mm, 1.8 \u00b5m (Agilent). Methanol standard was supplied from Merck Darmstad (Shimazdu, 2013).The methanol standard solution was prepared in final concertation of 150 ppm. 1 mL of this solution was put in headspace vial of 20 mL and 5 mL water was added. The sample was prepared with weighting 50 mg of Sodium citrate in a headspace vial and 6 mL water was added. 6 mL in a headspace vial was used as blank.  S2 PP 77172Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 171 - 172 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsResults and discussionSeveral modifications of the general method for determining water soluble residual solvents Class 1 and 2, were made (USP, 2015). The general method is: chromatography system, composed of gas chromatograph equipped with a flame-ionization detector, 0.32 mm x 30 m fused-silica column coated with a   1.8 \u00b5m layer of phase G43 (6% cyanopropylphenyl 94% dimethylpolysiloxane). The temperature of the column is maintained at 40 \u00b0C for 20 minutes, then raised at a rate of 10 \u00b0C per minute to 240 \u00b0C, and maintained at 240 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. The headspace conditions are: incubation at 80 \u00b0C for 60 minutes and syringe temperature of 90 \u00b0C (USP, 2015).  This method has undergone several modifications and adaptations during the verification process. The adaptation was made in the temperature program of the column. The peak of methanol was at ~2.2 min, and since the diluent was water, there are no other peaks than methanol; consequently it was not necessary to run the full temperature program. Therefore finally, the method was as follows: injector temperature 140 \u00b0C, detector temperature 250 \u00b0C, temperature program for the column: 40 \u00b0C /hold 20 min, then raised to 120 \u00b0C, at a rate of 30 \u00b0C per minute. In addition, adaptation in the headspace condition was made, precisely the incubation time was shorted to 30 minutes, and because it has been proven that there are no extra peaks, other than methanol. Tests that were performed during the verification were: specificity, repeatability, accuracy, detection limit (LOD) and quantification limit (LOQ).The specificity of the method was validated with demonstrating that there is no other peak from the diluent that interfere with the peak of methanol. The repeatability of the chromatographic system was determined with ten replicate injections of the standard and determining the Relative Standard Deviation (RSD). This RSD value for organic volatile solvents should be below 15. The accuracy of the method was determined by interaction studies for constant amount of sample, but varying concentration of methanol. The concentrations are: 50 ppm, 150 ppm, 300 ppm, 500 ppm, 2000 ppm and 3500 ppm. On each concentration level, three samples were injected and calculations were made. The limits for the recovery are 80 - 120% or RSD below 15%. For determination of the LOQ and LOD, criteria of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of about 10:1 and 3:1, respectively was employed. In the first step S/N ratio was determined on the standard of 150 ppm and that standard is used as a stock solution. Consequently several dilutions were prepared and S/N ratio was determined. S/N ratio of about 10:1 was obtained at concentration of 10 \u00b5g/ml, and that concentration was taken as LOQ. S/N ratio of about 3:1 was obtained at concentration of 3 \u00b5g/ml, and that concentration was taken as LOD.ConclusionThe verified method was proven to be suitable for determination of residual solvent methanol in Sodium Citrate.ReferencesCommittee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP), 2015.

D, Blvd. A. Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, R.Macedonia* szlatanovic@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionEndotoxins are high-molecular-weight complexes as-sociated with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bac-teria, and are the most significant pyrogen for the pharma-ceutical industry. The importance of endotoxin contamina-tion in sterile manufacturing becomes apparent when con-fronted with four aspects of its existence: its ubiquity in nature, potent toxicity, stability or ability to retain after be-ing subjected to extreme conditions and relative likelihood of its occurrence in pharmaceutical products. Any prepara-tion administered parenterally should be sterile and com-ply with the test for bacterial endotoxins, BET (Ph. Eur., 2014).Lactic acid is an organic compound with the formu-la CH3CH(OH)CO2H. It is a white, water-soluble solid or clear liquid that is produced both naturally and synthetical-ly. Lactic acid is chiral, consisting of two optical isomers. One is known as L-(+)-lactic acid or (S)-lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D-(-)-lactic acid or (R)-lac-tic acid. In humans, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. In industry, lactic acid fermentation is performed by lactic acid bacteria, which convert simple carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, or galactose to lactic acid.Lactic acid is used as an excipient in medicinal prod-ucts that are for intravenous administration. In medicine, lactate is one of the main components of antibiotics and in-fusion solutions. These intravenous fluids consist of sodi-um and potassium cations along with lactate and chloride anions in solution with distilled water, generally in concen-trations isotonic with human blood. Objective: Validation and quantification of BET (Bac-terial endotoxins test) with Turbidimetric kinetic method for Lactic acid. Materials and methodsMaterials (S)-Lactic acid; LAL reagent Water; Sodium Hydrox-ide 0.1 N for pH adjustment of sample; reagents for Kinetic turbidimetric method; PYROGENT-5000\u2122, LAL Reagent Water, disposable endotoxin-free glass dilution tubes; dis-posable sterile microplates; automatic hand - held pipettes with sterile tips; timer; vortex mixer; Microplate read-er Elx808cse from BIO-TEK\u00ae (BIO-TEK Instruments, INC.,P.O.BOX998, Highlsand Park, Winooski, Vermont 05404 USA).The results are calculated and stored with Win QCL 4.0.2 software\u2122 (Lonza\u00ae Walkersville, MD21793).MethodsThe Kinetic turbidimetric method is based on measur-ing the turbidity (optical density) of LAL/sample mixture at regular interval troughout the test. The time required be-fore the appearance of turbidity (reaction time) is inversely proportional to the amount of endotoxin present. In accordance with the Ph.Eur., 2014 and British phar-macopoeia commission, 2014, substances to be used in parenteral preparations must comply with BET, whatever their origin, since:- contamination by bacterial endotoxins can take place prior to or during the manufacturing pro-cess;- bacterial endotoxins cannot easily be removed by the manufacturing process;S2 PP 78174Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 173 - 174 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentations- bacterial endotoxins should be detected as ear-ly as possible in the manufacturing process.It is to be noted that the ICH Guideline Q6B: Specifi-cations: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Bio-technological/Biological Products provides the following recommendation under section 4.1 Drug Substance Speci-fication: \u201cPharmacopoeial tests (e.g., endotoxin detection) should be performed on the drug substance, where appro-priate\u201d. Lactic acid, as an excipient in parenteral prepara-tions, has strongly inhibitory effect on Bacterial endotox-ins test (Kinetic Turbidimetric method) because of its pH value and it is necessary to overcome this problem. Prob-lems with pH value are the most significant biochemical cause of LAL-test inhibition. When dealing with acid or base solutions, correction of pH should be made in opti-mum rang 6-8. Lactic acid has pH value of 1.2 and the correction should be done by diluting in with 0.1N NaOH (Zink McCullough, 2011; Williams, 2009).  Results and discussionValidation was performed begining with screening (In-hibition / Enhancement) test (FDA, 2012 ). The validation was performed on three batches. For that purpose Lonza\u00ae reagents were used; lysate sensitivity  \u03bb = 0,01 EU/ml; MVD = ELCxPP/\u03bb = 0.005x10/0.01 = 5. Dilutions used for preliminary, Inhibition/ Enhancement test were as fol-lows: 1:2, 1:4 and the MVD (maximum valid dilution) = 1:5 with LRW.To overcome the inhibition of lactic acid, the first di-lution was made with 0.1N NaOH from Lonza\u00ae and vor-tex for 1 minute. Test solutions (at dilutions: 1:2, 1:4 and 1:5) were obtained by diluting with LRW\u2122 from Lonza\u00ae. Lactic acid is not inhibitory in 1:2 dilution (pH=6.85-6.92), showing PPC recovery 120%. Test solutions (at dilutions 1:4 and 1:5, MVD) gave PPC recovery of 105% and 118% respectively. Upon received results the validation was done on three consecutive batches of lactic acid with dilution 1:2 (considering that recovery must be close to 100%). The endotoxin concentration reported for the three consecutive batches is less than 0.00200 EU/mg with PPC 78%, 94% and 91% respectively. All three batches of the tested lac-tic acid showed endotoxin recovery between 50 and 200%.Conclusion Validation of the Bacterial endotoxins test on (S)-Lac-tic acid was successfully done. The inhibition was over-come. Routine testing of (S)-Lactic acid should be done with dilution 1:2 (conc. 5 mg/ml) using LRW from Lon-za\u00ae. According to the results, the bacterial endotoxins test - Turbidimetric kinetic method for (S)-lactic acid was vali-dated and can be used for routine testing.ReferencesBritish pharmacopoeia commission, 2014.

This is part of the marketing authorization proce-dures, strictly stipulated and regulated by law. Macedonian Law on Veterinarian medicinal products (2010) is harmo-nized with the standards defined within the EU legislation. The main aim of this study is to present the current sit-uation regarding the marketing authorization of veterinary medicinal products in Macedonia and to identify strengths and weaknesses in the process of registration.Materials and methodsResearch presented in the study was completed with-in the period September-November 2015, through direct contact with the distributors of veterinary medicinal prod-ucts from all over Macedonia. Main research method was a questionnaire composed of 20 questions with option of an-swers. In order to reduce subjectivity the questionnaire of-fered a binary model with yes, no and not familiar as pos-sible answers. All questions in the questionnaire were con-crete and specific, targeting issues related with registration and selection of veterinary medicinal product, distribution practice, pharmacovigilance etc. All answers were careful-ly examined and the results of the research have indicated the current situation of the marketing authorization process of the veterinary medicinal products in the Macedonia. To all contacted companies anonymity in responding as well as data confidentiality was guaranteed.Results and discussionAll new veterinary medicinal products need to be ap-proved by the competent authority. After positive scientific evaluation of the submitted documentation, competent au-thority issues marketing authorization that allows the vet-erinary medicinal products to be placed on the market. Na-tional procedure is a type of authorization for veterinary medicinal products in Macedonia. The applicants need to submit an application to the Food and Veterinary Agency as a competent authority. The registration process of the vet-erinary medicinal products in Macedonia is governing by the Law on Veterinary Medicinal Products (2010), but its implementation is closely defined by the rulebooks, where it is clearly described troughs of the entire procedure. The report of this research contains qualitative infor-mation of the structural indicators and perceptions which were subsequently used for obtaining the qualitative pa-rameter with which reflect the present situation of knowl-edge of registration process for veterinary medicinal prod-ucts.In the Republic of Macedonia there are 23 veterinary medicinal products wholesalers which are registered by the Food and Veterinary Agency, and authorized to distribute veterinary medicinal products. Only 16 of them are active S2 PP 79176Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 175 - 176 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsin the field. During the preparation of this study, in order to receive more accurate information, all of them were con-tacted, but only 9 of them responded positively to our re-quest.The results of this research showed that veterinary me-dicinal products wholesalers in some points are familiar with the process of marketing authorization and post-mar-keting authorization and the Law on Veterinary medicinal products (2010), but there in certain areas of the epony-mous Law are not familiarized. On the basis of their an-swers, it can be concluded that most companies are famil-iar with the basics of the process, such as, the procedure for marketing authorization for veterinary medicinal product and legal obligations, the existence of a register of veteri-nary medicinal products, good distribution practice, good storage practice and procedure for withdrawal of veteri-nary medicinal products. On the questions such as: infor-mation of public interest, the existence of national refer-ence laboratories, the existence of a national list of essen-tial veterinary medicinal products, pharmacovigilance sys-tem, some of respondents did not know the exact answer, indicating a poorly knowledge of the marketing authoriza-tion and post-marketing authorization of veterinary medic-inal product on these specific issues.The results also show that the Good distribution prac-tice and Good storage practice are implemented and that the cooperation between companies and Food and Veteri-nary Agency is on satisfactory level. On the website of the Food and Veterinary Agency there are clearly set of infor-mation of public interest for implementation of the mar-keting authorization process for the interested parties, but some of them had trouble in their availabilityThis research indicated satisfactory level of the imple-mentation of the law in practice, identified, as follows: the existence of publicly available written information about the procedure of marketing authorization of veterinary me-dicinal products, formally established commission for re-view of applications for registration, the existence of a for-mal system for submitting complaints commission fea-ture. There are some weaknesses in the process of market-ing authorization, such as: an official national essential list for veterinary medicinal products is not amended by 2012, absence of timed deadline for providing official informa-tion on the status of application for approval for marketing, absence of publicly available pharmacovigilance system, and additionally, not always satisfactory level of applica-ble knowledge on the process and issues connected with the process by the veterinary medicinal products wholesal-ers\u2019 representatives. ConclusionIn this paper all aspect of the issue of marketing au-thorization of veterinary medicinal products in Macedonia were studied and critically analyzed. On the basis of the collected data, the existing legislation, as well as, admin-istrative procedures of marketing authorization and post-marketing authorization of veterinary medicinal products can be revised and adjusted providing better efficiency and transparency. Furthermore, although the cooperation be-tween the wholesalers and Agency of Food and Veterinary was found to be satisfactory, improvement of communica-tion could be the added value.ReferencesAssembly of the Republic of Macedonia, 2010.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* cdolikoska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionThe transfer of analytical procedures (TAP), also re-ferred to as method transfer, is the documented process that qualifies a laboratory (the receiving unit, RU) to use an analytical test procedure for quality control, that is fully validated in another laboratory (the transferring unit, TU) (USP, 2012). Usually, the most common need for this pro-cedure is transferring methods developed and validated in the research and development department to the quality control unit in the same or different site. In the last years, with widening the business strategies of the pharmaceuti-cal companies, necessity for different types of transfer oc-curs. Transfer activities are required between Quality con-trol laboratories of the manufacturers and different batch release laboratories: laboratories of the contactor suppli-ers, contract laboratories and European Union batch re-lease testing sites.The presented paper describes the process of Analyti-cal method transfer for Cilostazol 100 mg tablets in which Alkaloid QC laboratory is involved as receiving laboratory. Materials and methodsAnalytical method transfer protocol is created, re-viewed and approved by both laboratories, prior to exper-imental performing of the methods (Eudralex, 2014). Ac-cording the protocol, assessing the sort of test and the ex-perience of the receiving laboratory, the methods to be transferred have been determined: - The method for Dissolution - UV Spectropho-tometry method;- The method for Assay of cilostazol - gradient HPLC method with UV detection;- The method for Identification of cilostazol - as-sessed in Assay;- The method for Related and degradation sub-stances - gradient HPLC method with UV de-tectionMethods for all the rest specification parameters: ap-pearance, uniformity of mass, subdivision, water content, Uniformity of dosage units by mass variation don`t need to be transferred. Microbial examination method should be verified but it is not part of this protocol. One batch of Cilostazol tablets 100 mg was tested in both laboratories. Results and discussionIn the analytical procedure for dissolution test, follow-ing system suitability acceptance criteria are set: no sig-nificant blank absorbance is noticed, RSD% of 6 replicate measurements of cilostazol standard 1 should be \u2264 2.0%, cilostazol standard 2 recovery should be between 98.0 - 102.0%. System suitability criteria are met in both labora-tories. The analysis for dissolution was performed on six samples in the TU and on 12 samples in the RU involv-ing different days, instruments and analysts. The results were compared at the specification time limit of 60 min-utes. The obtained results for inter-laboratory repeatability: mean values of 96.33% and 91.81% are within the limits of not less than 85% (Q=80) in 60 minutes. Absolute differ-ence between 6 samples per each laboratory is 1.80% and 3.80% respectively, absolute difference between the labo-ratories is 4.52%. All differences are below 5% which is set S2 PP 80178Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 177 - 178 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsas acceptance criteria (Medsafe, 2007; WHO, 2011). The obtained results for intra-laboratory repeatability (repro-ducibility in RU): absolute difference between each anal-ysis of 6 samples is 3.80% and 1.80% respectively, abso-lute difference between 12 samples is 1.24%. All differenc-es are below 5% which is set as acceptance criteria. The linearity of the method in the concentration range for cilo-stazol from 20 % to 120 % of the theoretical sample solu-tion concentration is proved in the RU. Acceptance crite-ria for Linearity are accomplished: correlation coefficient \u2265 0.999, Y-intercept confidence interval includes zero, re-sidual plot presents no particular trend, RSD (%) of the re-sponse factor \u2264 2.0%. In the analytical procedure for assay following system suitability acceptance criteria are set: no blank interference is noticed at the cilostazol elution time, RSD of the areas of cilostazol peak of 5 consecutive injections should be \u2264 2.0%, symmetry factor (As) of cilostazol peak should be \u2264 2.0, cilostazol standard 2 recovery should be between 98.0 - 102.0%. System suitability criteria are met in both labo-ratories. The analysis for assay was performed on six sam-ple preparations in the TU and on 12 sample preparations in the RU involving different days, instruments and ana-lysts. The obtained results for inter-laboratory repeatabili-ty: mean values of 100.18% and 99.59% are within the lim-its for cilostazol content of 95.0 - 105.0%. Absolute differ-ence between 6 samples per each laboratory is 1.20% and 0.80% respectively, absolute difference between the labo-ratories is 1.50%. All differences are below 3% which is set as acceptance criteria (Medsafe, 2007; WHO, 2011).

All differenc-es are below 3% which is set as acceptance criteria. Iden-tification is confirmed by obtaining similar retention times for cilostazol in sample and standard solution. The lineari-ty of the method in the concentration range between 80 % of the theoretical sample solution concentration to 120% is proved in the RU. Acceptance criteria for linearity are accomplished: correlation coefficient \u2265 0.999, Y-intercept confidence interval includes zero, residual plot presents no particular trend, RSD (%) of the response factor \u2264 2.0%. In the analytical procedure for Related substances fol-lowing system suitability acceptance criteria are set: reso-lution between peaks of impurity B and cilostazol > 1.5, no blank interference is noticed during the cilostazol elu-tion time, RSD of the areas of Cilostazol peak of 5 consec-utive injections \u2264 2.0%, Standard 2 recovery should be be-tween 95.0 \u2013 105.0%, As of Cilostazol peak should be \u2264 2.0. System suitability criteria are met in both laboratories. Limit of quantification (QL) is determined and confirmed in the RU. 0.01% cilostazol standard solution gives S:N ra-tio of 14 which is \u2265 10:1.  The obtained RSD at QL level is 7.83% which is lower than the acceptance criteria \u2264 15.0% (ICH, 2005). The analysis for related substances was per-formed on six sample preparations in the TU and on 12 sample preparations in the RU involving different days, in-struments and analysts. Acceptance criteria for inter and intra laboratory repeatability are set: the % impurity should comply with the release specification Impurity B \u2264 0.2%, unknown impurities \u2264 0.2%, total impurities \u2264 0.5%. Ob-serving chromatographic profiles and results obtained by both laboratories, it can be concluded that they are qualita-tively and quantitatively similar. The linearity of the meth-od in the concentration range between QL and 0.20% is proved in the RU. Acceptance criteria for linearity are ac-complished: correlation coefficient \u2265 0.999, Y-intercept confidence interval includes zero, residual plot presents no particular trend, %RSD of the response factor \u2264 10.0%. ConclusionFrom the comparison of the obtained results from both laboratories it can be concluded that all results are meet-ing the predetermined acceptance criteria limits. No devia-tions from the protocol were observed. Analytical method transfer report is generated by the transferring laboratory, reviewed and approved by both laboratories. The success-fulness of the transfer is confirmed. The analytical trans-fer report qualifies Alkaloid QC laboratory to use the Ci-lostazol 100 mg tablets finished product methods of anal-ysis, ensuring that the receiving laboratory has the proce-dure, knowledge and ability to perform it.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* bjakimovska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionPharmaceutical counterfeiting is an expanding threat to worldwide public health. It crosses geographic boundar-ies and impacts patients suffering from a variety of diseas-es. It is a crime that generates large profits for the counter-feiters even as it steals one of medicine\u2019s most important ingredients: trust. According to the World Health Organi-zation (WHO), a counterfeit medicine is one that is delib-erately and fraudulently mislabeled with respect to identi-ty and/or source. Counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic medicines and counterfeits may include prod-ucts that are fraudulently packaged or mislabeled with re-spect to identity and/or source;  contain no active ingre-dient, incorrect quantities or an undeclared active ingre-dient; contaminated with other materials; past their expi-ry date; contain no or incorrect patient information leaf-lets (WHO, 2010). The most counterfeit medicines are can-cer medicines, cholesterol lowering medicines, antibiotics, hypertension medicines, hormones, steroids and copies of many commonly used pain killers and antihistamines. In developing countries, counterfeit medicines are drugs for the treatment of life-threatening conditions such as malar-ia, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.Counterfeit medicines - reason and consequences There are several reasons for counterfeiting. One of the main reasons is profit, because manufacturing of coun-terfeit medicines is very low cost and doesn\u2019t meet quali-ty and safety standards. Inadequate legislation, regulations and enforcement results in supply systems vulnerable to counterfeit products and extremely low capacity to uncov-er and punish counterfeiters. The costs of legitimate med-icines, both original and generic, may be too high for pa-tients, and is one of the reasons why patients buy cheaper medicine with dubious quality. The consequences of counterfeit medicines could be divided into three groups: consequences for the public and patients\u2019 health, consequences for pharmaceutical compa-ny and consequences for the country. Consequences for the public and patients health are life-threatening effects, does not provide effective treatment, needs prolonged hos-pitalization, cause direct damage or toxic effects. Counter-feit medicines cause direct financial losses for the compa-ny and loss of reputation and trust of patients. The conse-quences for the country include evading payment of taxes and customs duties and higher costs in the health system.Activities of the pharmaceutical industry against counterfeiting of drugs Pharmaceutical industry is one link of the chain that is fully committed in combating counterfeiting medicines and takes actions to protect their products. There are two main forms of product security and those are traceabili-ty and authentication. Traceability means ability to track drugs cheaply, securely, and efficiently across the globe, from manufacturer to patient, thus improving the safety of medicines. Tracking technologies allows pharmaceutical products to be tracked and monitored as they move from the manufacturer to the patient. The synonym for tracking technologies is \u201d Track and Trace\u201d, and it incorporates se-rialization and pedigree. This technology implies an abili-ty of the system to know where a product went (track) and where it came from (trace). Serialization is simply a pro-cess of assigning a unique number to a unit of production such that it can be identified later. Pedigree is process of re-cording most or all of the product history.There are various authentication technologies that can be used at different levels of packaging and in different circumstances. Most security-printing deterrents can be grouped into three categories: overt, covert, and forensic. S2 PP 81180Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 179 - 180 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsOvert features are easy to detect by sight, touch or smell. Examples of overt security-printing deterrents include col-or-shifting inks, alignments that are difficult to replicate, microprinting, optically variable microstructures (also known as holograms) and visible watermark. Covert fea-tures can be detected by machines but are not visible to the naked eye. Examples of covert security-printing de-terrents include invisible inks (such as those visible only when exposed to ultraviolet light), magnetic printing, en-crypted codes, hidden overprints, micro-displacement of glyphs and metal fibers. Forensic features require laborato-ry testing in order to be detected. Examples of forensic se-curity printing deterrents include various embedded chem-ical compositions known as chemical taggants that are de-signed to uniquely identify an object (Davison, 2011) Combining track-and-trace with secure printing dra-matically improves protection against counterfeiting and increases efficiencies in product recalls and other supply chain challenges.Global activities in combating counterfeit There are three strategies that are applied globally in order to combat counterfeiting of medicines\u2022 Providing tools, international norms, standards and guidelines to assist that medicines circulating in nation-al and international commerce are safe, efficacious and of good quality\u2022 Providing support to non EU and EU Member States to build national regulatory capacity \u2022 Developing global activities to combat counterfeit medicines, in collaboration with all relevant stakeholdersIn 2006, World Health Organization established Inter-national Medical Products Anti Counterfeiting Taskforce (IMPACT) and the main conceptual approach is a volun-tary coalition of partners, with the purpose of coordinat-ing international activities aimed at combating counter-feit medical products. IMPACT partners reflect the fact that combating counterfeiting of medical products can-not be successfully achieved by the health sector alone but requires a coordinated effort and effective collabora-tion among health sector, enforcement, border control, jus-tice (all at different administrative levels), as well as health professionals, manufacturers, importers, distributors, me-dia, and patients/consumers. IMPACT outputs include rec-ommendations, policy advice and training materials that reflect consensus reached among IMPACT partners (IM-PACT, 2010).ReferencesDavison, M., 2011.

Cyril and Methodius,  Mother Theresa 17, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* lbogdanovska@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionThe process of evaluation of the efficacy of a given pharmacological treatment, in general, is performed in two subsequent steps: 1) monitoring numerous pre-defined clinical and laboratory parameters which provide informa-tion on treatment benefits and 2) analysis and interpreta-tion of the obtained results. In order to get thorough under-standing of the studied problem, the data obtained in step 2 are studied using chemometric algorithms for multivar-iate data analysis. Compared to the traditional univariate approach, the application of chemometric algorithms pro-vides comprehensive overview of the studied data and re-sults in greater statistical power even when there is small number of observations or missing data points (Helmy et al., 2012).The treatment of periodontal disease consists of scal-ing and root planning followed by local application of an-tiseptics or antibiotics such as chlorhexidine (CHX) and doxycycline (DOX). The efficacy of the treatment is mon-itored using the following parameters: clinical indices (index of gingival inflammation (GI), periodontal pock-et depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL)) or de-termination ofactivity/concentration of inflammatory bio-markers in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) such as en-zymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydroge-nase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or cyto-kines: interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor \u2013\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) (Aimmeti et al., 2012). However, the data analy-sis of the results obtained from monitoring treatment effi-cacy parameters is commonly performed using the tradi-tional approach (Tu et al., 2009). The aim of our study was to perform comparative eval-uation of the efficacy of local periodontal treatment with DOX and local periodontal treatment with CHX using che-mometric algorithm for multivariate data analysis, orthog-onal projection to latent structures - discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Materials and methodsThe subjects enrolled in the study were divided in two groups: a group of 25 patients (DOX group) treated local-ly with 10% DOX gel (controlled-release gel formulation) and a group of 34 patients (CHX group) treated locally with 1% CHX gel (conventional-release gel formulation). DOX group was treated with 115 mg gel containing 10 mg of DOX and the GCF samples were taken 7 days after the local treatment. The CHX group was administered 330 mg gel containing 2 mg CHX and GCF samples were taken 30 min after gel application. GCF samples were collected from quadrants consisting of five periodontal pockets, be-fore and after the local treatment. In brief, paper strips were placed in the selected periodontal pockets until mild resis-tance was felt and left in place for 30 s. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Com-mittee at the Faculty of Dentistry, Skopje.For determination of biomarker activity/concentra-S2 PP 82182Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 181 - 182 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationstion in GCF, five paper strips were placed in 500 \u03bcL PBS (phosphate buffer saline, pH=7.4) and the tube was cen-trifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm (4 \u02daC). The resulting so-lutions were divided in two aliquots of 250 \u03bcL. The ali-quot for determination of enzyme activity was assayed im-mediately after collection whereas the aliquot for determi-nation of cytokine concentration was added proteinase in-hibitor cocktail and kept at \u2013 80 \u02daC until analysis. ALP, LDH and AST activity in GCF samples was determined using appropriate kits in accordance with the Internation-al Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) recommenda-tions. The concentration of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in GCF sam-ples was determined according to manufacturer\u2019s instruc-tions, using commercial ELISA kits. The clinical indices PD and CAL were measured in mm, while the index of gin-gival inflammation was scored with values 1-3 (1-healthy tissue, 2-moderate inflammation, 3-severe inflammation). The OPLS-DA algorithm was applied using SIMCA 13.0.3 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). The comparisons of significantly different variables between the DOX group and the CHX group, identified by the OPLS-DA model, were confirmed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test in the SPSS 17 software. P < 0.05 was considered sta-tistically significant.Results and discussionOPLS-DA is a supervised chemometric algorithm widely applied to investigate different treatment effects. The properties of the OPLS-DA provide comprehensive description on the discrimination between classes of sam-ples, especially in cases where subtle differences among classes are present. This algorithm separates the system-atic variation in the matrix X (inflammatory biomarkers and clinical indices for the DOX and the CHX group, in our case) in two parts, one linearly related (variation of interest) to the matrix Y (the classification variables) and one orthogonally related (so-called orthogonal variation or structured noise) to the matrix Y. The partitioning of the X-data improves the interpretation of the model.In the score plot of the developed OPLS-DA model, the samples from both treatment groups were divided in two different clusters, indicating that DOX and CHX show different effect on the examined variables. To confirm model validity, the method of cross-validation was used. The results from the cross-validation were R2X (cum) = 0.527, R2Y (cum) = 0.507 and Q2X (cum) = 0.530, indi-cating a good model.Based on the VIP statistics from the cross-validated OPLS \u2013 DA model, statistically significant variables re-sponsible for separation between both treatment groups were extracted. VIP ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the generation of the model. According to the criterion for the VIP statistics, a VIP value > 0.8 was used as a threshold value for determining importance of vari-ables. The variables most strongly influencing the discrim-ination between the DOX treatment group and the CHX treatment group were periodontal pocket depth, AST activ-ity and concentration of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in GCF. The discriminatory variables identified by the OPLS-DA model were additionally confirmed at a univariate lev-el by the non-parametric Mann Whitney U test (P<0.05) which revealed that the DOX treatment markedly de-creased periodontal pocket depth, AST activity and con-centration of the cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in GCF com-pared to the CHX treatment. The different effects are due to the different mechanism of action of DOX and CHX. DOX possesses anti-inflammatory properties, thus is de-creasing the inflammatory response presented by the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. This molecule also stabilizes cell membranes, which decreases the activi-ty of intracytoplasmic enzymes, such as AST. ConclusionThe comparative evaluation of the efficacy of the local periodontal treatment with DOX and the local periodon-tal treatment with CHX using the OPLS-DA algorithm re-vealed differences in the therapeutic effects of both treat-ments, at the same time providing insights into their mech-anisms of action. The results from this study suggest that the OPLS-DA algorithm is a valuable tool for comparative evaluation of treatment efficacy.

Cyril and Methodius\u201d,  Mother Theresa 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* lbogdanovska@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionDoxycycline (DOX), a second generation tetracycline antibiotic, is widely used in the treatment of periodonti-tis. DOX accumulates in gingival fibroblasts and is further distributed in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), a valuable matrix for monitoring concentration of drugs used in peri-odontal treatment (Lavda et al., 2004). Since GCF is ex-creted in low volumes, determination of drug\u2019s concentra-tion must be performed using sensitive methods. Applica-tion of HPLC-UV methods for DOX determination in bi-ological samples results in inadequate sensitivity. On the other hand, HPLC methods with fluorescent (FLD) detec-tion provide the required sensitivity and are less affected by interference from other components from the sample matrix (Denic et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2004).     The aim of our study was to develop, optimize and val-idate RP-HPLC-FLD method for determination of DOX in GCF and saliva. Materials and methodsReferent standards of DOX, tetracycline (internal stan-dard, IS) and oxytetracycline were supplied by Sigma-Al-drich (Germany). Solvents (methanol and water) were of HPLC grade and reagents (CH3COONa, EDTA disodium salt and CaCl2) were of analytical grade. Whatmann 3MM chromatography paper strips, 2 x 5 mm (Whatman Lab sales Ltd., UK) were used for GCF collection.Calibration standards for determination of DOX in GCF were prepared using serum instead of GCF, in the fol-lowing concentrations: 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, 500 and 1000 ng/mL. For determination of DOX in saliva samples, the concentrations of the calibration standards prepared in saliva were 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, and 500 ng/mL. For both GCF and saliva samples, the concentration of the IS was 1 \u03bcg/mL. Methanol: water mixture (50:50, V/V) was used as an extracting solvent.60 patients with chronic periodontitis were assigned in two groups (group I and II). Group I (n=30) received con-ventional short-term orally administered regimen (100 mg DOX, once a day for 21 days). Group II (n=30) received sub antimicrobial dose doxycycline (SDD) regimen (20 mg DOX, twice daily for 2 months). GCF samples were collected from 10 periodontal pockets (pocket depth: 3-5 mm) for 30 s, by insertion of the paper strips in the pock-et and unstimulated saliva samples were collected in sterile containers (- 20 \u02daC until analysis). GCF and saliva samples were collected 7, 15 and 21 days after beginning of thera-py (group I) and 15, 30 and 60 days after beginning of ther-apy in patients from group II. The study protocol was ap-proved by the Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Dentist-ry, Skopje. Before analysis, 50 \u03bcL IS working standard solution and methanol: water mixture (50:50, V/V) as an extract-S2 PP 83184Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 183 - 184 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsing solvent was added to each GCF sample up to volume of 500 \u03bcL. They were vortex for 30 s and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. For saliva samples, 100 \u03bcL of IS working standard solution was added to a 500 \u03bcL sample. The extraction solvent (methanol: water mixture (50:50, V/V) was added up to volume of 1000 \u03bcL. Saliva samples were vortex-mixed for 30 s and then centrifuged 5 min at 4000 rpm. The HPLC analysis was conducted on Agilent 1200 RR series. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Purospher STAR RP 18e column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm) at 30 \u02daC. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and buffer solution (a mixture of 15 mM CaCl2, 25 mM CH3COONa and 25 mM Na2EDTA, pH=8.1), 50:50, V/V. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min. DOX and IS were record-ed at 380 nm as excitation (\u03bbex) and 532 nm as emission wavelength (\u03bbem). 100 \u03bcL were injected on the column. The total runtime for the analysis was 10 min. Results and discussionDuring preliminary investigations, mobile phase com-position, \u03bbex and \u03bbem, flow rate and the volume of injec-tion were optimized. An IS was selected as well. Several mobile phases containing methanol and buf-fer solution were investigated where the organic phase was varied from 20-50% (organic phase/buffer, V/V). The best result was obtained using mobile phase containing 50% methanol and 50% buffer solution (V/V). Mobile phase flow rate was investigated in the range from 0.6-1 mL/min and the final flow rate was set at 0.8 mL/min. The injection volume was tested and it was found that 100 \u03bcL was opti-mal for further analysis. DOX fluorescence intensity was estimated using the following \u03bbex: 375 nm, 380 nm, 385 nm and \u03bbem: 512 nm, 520 nm and 532 nm. The optimal value for the \u03bbex and \u03bbem were 380 nm and 532 nm, re-spectively. Two compounds were tested as an IS, tetracy-cline and oxytetracyline. Under the optimized conditions, oxytetracycline resulted in poorer peak symmetry and elut-ed early, so tetracycline was selected instead. After the en-tire optimization procedure the retention times for DOX and IS were 5.1 min and 6.5 min, respectively. Method validation was performed according to EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMA, 2011). Selectivity of the method was evaluated by compari-son of blank GCF and saliva samples and spiked samples of GCF and saliva containing DOX and IS. No interfering peaks were found at the retention times of DOX and the IS in both samples, thus method selectivity was confirmed. For GCF samples, linearity was observed within range 20-1000 ng/mL (R2=0.9979). The within- run accuracy and precision ranged from 96.29-112.93% with a coefficient of variation (CV) within the range 2.60-4.66%. The between \u2013day accuracy and precision was within the range from 98.29-104.23 with a CV from 2.32 \u2013 7.05%. The mean ex-traction recovery (94.6-98.77%) confirmed an efficient ex-traction procedure.    For saliva samples, linearity ranged from 20-500 ng/mL (R2=0.9965). The with-in run accuracy and precision ranged from 95.30-109.2% with a coefficient of varia-tion (CV) within the range 0.81-4.26%. The between -day accuracy and precision was within the range from 99.00 -109.26% with a CV of 2.11 - 8.34%. The mean extraction recovery of DOX from saliva samples (96.13-98.5%) con-firmed an efficient extraction procedure. Stability testing showed that GCF and saliva samples are stable after three freeze-thaw cycles, after 12 hours in the autosampler, 24 hours at room temperature and one month at \u2013 20 \u02daC.   The validated method was applied for determination of DOX concentrations in GCF and saliva samples from periodontitis patients. DOX concentrations in GCF sam-ples for group I on day 7, 15 and 21 reached 2.24 \u00b10.32 \u03bcg/mL, 1.68 \u00b1 0.19 \u03bcg/mL and 1.39 \u00b1 0.17 \u03bcg/mL, respective-ly. The DOX concentration in saliva samples for the select-ed time points were  0.19 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcg/mL, 0.07 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcg/mL and 0.04 \u00b1 0.01 \u03bcg/mL. For group II, DOX concentrations in GCF samples on day 15, 30 and 60 were 1.72 \u00b1 0.29 \u03bcg/mL, 1.67 \u00b1 0.33 \u03bcg/mL and 1.38 \u00b1 0.12 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. For saliva sam-ples, DOX concentrations on day 15, 30 and 60 were 0.71 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcg/mL, 0.88 \u00b1 0.22 \u03bcg/mL and 0.31\u00b1 0.07 \u03bcg/mL, re-spectively. As it can be seen from the results, the determined DOX concentrations in GCF are much higher compared to those in saliva which is consistent with the fact that gingival fibroblasts act as reservoirs of this drug (Lavda et al., 2004).ConclusionThe data presented in this study indicate that the pro-posed method used for determination of DOX in GCF and saliva samples showed satisfactory selectivity, linearity, accuracy and precision. The method is therefore suitable and applicable for the analysis of DOX in GCF and saliva samples in patients undergoing conventional or SDD peri-odontal therapy.

Given the complexity of the blood as an extraction medium, matrix effect (ME) is the most critical aspect in the method development. For these rea-sons, particular attention should be paid during the opti-mization of the extraction procedure. There are several re-ported LLE procedures for extraction of indapamide us-ing HPLC-UV or MS detection (Hang et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2005; Zendelovska et al., 2003). However they did not meet the expectations concerning the modern bioanalytical challenges towards sample preparation. In our previous-ly published research, automated SPE-LC-MS/MS meth-od for determination of indapamide in blood was devel-oped (Nakov et al., 2013). Given the automation of the ex-traction procedure, the method resulted in low matrix ef-fect and great performance consistency. Taking into con-sidering that this type of equipment is not very disseminat-ed across the laboratories, optimization of low matrix LLE was acceded.  The effectiveness of the LLE procedure in remov-ing ME depends on the choice of a suitable organic sol-vent, because various organic solvents can remove differ-ent classes of phospholipids. Since the phospholipids are the main class of endogenous components responsible for the ME, monitoring of the specific phospholipids mass transitions was used as a tool for targeted optimization of the LLE procedure for indapamide extraction from human whole blood. Materials and methodsThe blood samples (0.5 mL) were spiked with 50 \u03bcL zolpidem tartarate (internal standards, IS) working solu-tion of 300 ng/mL, 1 mL 5% ZnSO4 and 1 mL 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6.8). The samples were vortex-mixed for 2 min and 1 mL organic solvent was added. The extraction was performed by vortex-mixing for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min, the upper or-ganic layer was transferred to another tube and evaporated in vacuum centrifuge for 60 min. The dried residues were dissolved in 1 mL methanol and 10 \u00b5L were injected into the LC-MS/MS system. The experiments were performed on Shimadzu LCMS 8030 triple quadrupole mass spec-trometer in positive ESI mode, using Kinetex C18 (100 x 2.1mm, 1.7\u00b5m particle size) chromatographic column. Mobile phase was consisted of a mixture of 2 mM ammo-nium acetate (added 0.5 mL formic acid in 1L buffer) and acetonitrile in ratio 10:90. Analyses were conducted at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Positive precursor ion scan m/z 184 was used for phospholipids monitoring. Indapamide and IS were quantified in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) using the transition of m/z 366.1\u2192132.15 and m/z 309.0\u2192236.10, respectively.  Results and discussionThe procedure of monitoring specific mass transitions of phospholipids (precursor ions scan of m/z 184) provides information about all precursor ions that fragment to tri-methylammonium-ethyl phosphate ion (m/z 184), allow-ing detection of all phosphatidylcholine phospholipids, ly-sophospholipids and sphingomyelins. This procedure was used for identification of the class of phospholipids pres-S2 PP 84186Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 185 - 186 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsent in blood extracts and selection of an appropriate ex-traction solvent for LLE of indapamide. Two nonpolar (di-ethyl ether; mixture of n-hexane and dichloromethane) and two polar (5% MTBE in NH4OH and MTBE) extraction solvents were evaluated for elimination of ME and extrac-tion recovery during the optimization of the LLE proce-dure. Post-extraction experiments were conducted to de-termine the degree of ME. The absolute ME was assessed from the responses obtained from blood extract containing indapamide added after the LLE and same concentration of indapamide added to neat solution. The post-extraction experiments showed that the nonpolar solvents gave high ME (30%). Intense peaks in the region from 1.5 - 4 min were found in the total ion chromatogram (TIC) of pre-cursor ions scan of m/z 184. Several precursor ions (m/z 496, m/z 520 and m/z 512) were detected in both blood extracts using nonpolar extraction solvents. These precur-sor ions indicated the presence of lysophospholipids. Ly-sophospholipids belong to the class of early-eluting phos-pholipids and given the short retention time of indapamide (1.55 min), it was evident that this class of phospholipids was responsible for the ME. The literature data showed that polar organic solvent are more effective in lysophospholipids removal (Cham-bers et al., 2007). Therefore, the subsequent experiments towards LLE optimization were conducted using more po-lar extraction solvents (alkaline MTBE and MTBE). The TIC of precursor ions scan of m/z 184 obtained from blood extract after LLE with alkaline MTBE, also showed pres-ents of lysophospholipids. The absolute ME was reduced from 30% to 63.6%. However, if we consider the ME (91%) obtained using the automated SPE procedure (Na-kov et al., 2013); the obtained result was still unsatisfac-tory. In addition, the extraction recovery was low (around 62%). The use of MTBE resulted in significant removal of lysophospholipids, which was confirmed with the phos-pholipids monitoring. The phospholipids signals obtained during the precursor ions scan of m/z 184 were with low intensity, which coincided with the post-extraction experi-ments. The ME obtained using MTBE as extraction solvent was 90.4%, suggesting that removal of the ME from com-plex biological material such as whole blood was achieved. The recovery of indapamide was found to be around 77% and the coefficient of variation of the LLE procedure was around 5%, thus confirming the acceptable repeatability.ConclusionIn this research, it was found that MTBE is effective solvent for lysophospholipids removal from human blood, thus leading to elimination of ME during the LLE of indap-amide. The monitoring of specific mass transitions of phos-pholipids, as well as the post-extraction experiments, con-firmed that the optimized LLE yields clean extract same as the automated SPE, thus it could be used for extraction of indapamide from human blood during the pharmacokinet-ic and bioequivalent studies.ReferencesChambers, E., Wagrowski-Diehl, D.M., Lu, Z., Mazzeo, J.R., 2007.

Cyril and Methodius University,  Ruger Boskovic 16, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* vdubrova@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionLately, the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) for extending the shelf life of the pharmaceutical products has been gaining more actualization and application, particu-larly in the pharmaceutical industry (Lyon et al., 2000).Data used for the statistical evaluation are collect-ed from the examined parameters indicating the impact of the storage conditions on the quality, safety and efficacy of the product defined in the shelf life specification during the monitoring of the long-term stability of a final pharmaceu-tical product (Yoshioka and Stella, 2000). After comple-tion of the stability studies the results are evaluated in ac-cordance with the regulation (ICH, 2003a).The goal of this paper was to explore the possibility of shelf life extension based on statistical evaluation of stabil-ity data of ongoing stability studies for final pharmaceuti-cal product, Lisinopril tablets of 10mg, that contain active substances from different manufacturers, both with Euro-pean quality certification (EDQM, 2015).Materials and methodsThe investigated batches of final pharmaceutical product, Lisinopril tablets 10 mg, with incorporated active substanc-es from two different manufacturers, were examined over fol-lowing stability indicating parameters: content of active sub-stance, release of the active substance, related and degrada-tion products and organoleptic characteristics (Diana, 2008).Samples used in studies of stability are kept in stabili-ty chambers, with strictly defined and controlled monitor-ing of temperature and relative humidity (\u0394C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, \u0394RH \u00b1 5%) with the software system Sympati (ICH, 2003a). F-test method and analysis of variance (ANOVA) have been applied to the obtained analytical data in order to determine whether there are statistically significant differenc-es between the batches in which the active substance is built from different manufacturers, or whether the quality of the active substance from various manufacturers affects the qual-ity of the final product and the variation of the tested param-eters (O\u2019Brien, 1979). The interdependence between the re-sults obtained with the long-term stability tests to 36 months is determined by using regression analysis. Regression anal-ysis of the dependence of the tested parameters from the time of examination is performed by logarithmic regression, as a kind of curve that best corresponds to the nature of the re-sults. Non-linear, i.e. logarithmic regression more suitably reflects the actual connection between the examination time and tested parameters, i.e. the content and release of the ac-tive substance. Based on the equation, the desired shelf life is provided and it is compared with the experimentally obtained value of the parameters tested for 48 months.Results and discussionEvaluation of the results of stability study within the pre-scribed period of useThe calculated F-value is 1.89 for the content of the active substance, i.e. 1.68 for the release of the active sub-S2 PP 85188Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 187 - 188 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsstance, which is a value lower than the tabular F-value = 19.0 on 2 degrees of freedom and statistical confidence of 99.0%, which means that there is no statistically signifi-cant difference between the variability of the content of the active substance and the release of the active substance in the tested batches of different manufacturers of the active substance.According the Analysis of the variance, F-test value (p = 0.968 > 0.05 and p = 0.847 > 0.05), it can be conclud-ed that among the average values of the content and re-lease of the active substance in Lisinopril tablets 10 mg of both manufacturers there is no statistically significant dif-ference.Evaluation of the results of extended stability studiesThe results obtained by determining the content of the active substance during long-term stability tests are incor-porated in the logarithmic regression curve, from which extrapolating theoretical values for the content of the ac-tive substance are derived for the new proposed shelf life of 48 months. The same examined samples of batches of Lisinopril 10 mg tablets are left in the room for stabili-ty under the same conditions for another 12 months, in to-tal 48 months.By extrapolating the logarithmic regression curve the-oretical values for the content of the active substance in Lisinopril tablets 10 mg are obtained after 48 months, with an interval of reliability at a statistical confidence of 95% and compared with the experimental values obtained. All experimental values were in the range of extrapolated val-ues.By extrapolating of the logarithmic regression curve, theoretical values for release of the active substance in Lisinopril tablets 10 mg after 48 months are obtained, with interval of confidence at a statistical confidence of 95% and compared with experimental values obtained. All ex-perimental values were in the range of extrapolated values. In the study for the stability of tested Lisinopril tab-lets 10 mg, the parameter \u201crelated content and degradation products\u201d was monitored as well as the organoleptic char-acteristics of the same batches on which content and re-lease the active component of both manufacturers was de-termined. Most of the obtained values for impurities were below limit of quantification, defined in the validation of analytical methods. These parameters were processed us-ing risk analysis. Risk assessment of Lisinopril tablets 10 mg was performed by using Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) method to identify and assess the risk of extend-ing the shelf life and introducing an active substance from a new manufacturer.ConclusionIn line with the pre set goals of this paper, the influ-ence of the choice of the active substance on the stability of Lisinopril 10 mg tablets is defined through monitoring the stability with defined testing up to 36 months, with possi-bility of extending the shelf life up to 48 months, in order to extend the period of use.The results of the determination of the content and re-lease of the active substance during the stability tests up to 48 months, indicate that none of the tested batches of Lisinopril tablets 10 mg exceeds the limit of the permitted deviation of the content of the active substance of 94% i.e. the limit of tolerance of the parameter of release does not affect the stability and quality of products and allows ex-tension of the active substance of 85%. It can be conclud-ed that the expiry date can be extender for an additional 12 months, without risk of occurrence of endangering the health of the patient, if using the active substance of the two manufacturers.Monitoring and statistical evaluation of the results from the stability studies of the final pharmaceutical prod-uct has proved as useful approach for extending the shelf life of products with proven life cycle stability and possi-bility for incorporation of active substances from different manufacturers. This concept can be applied to any prod-uct of interest and established need for extension of the shelf life.ReferencesDiana, F.J., 2008.

Well defined cleaning procedure must be used to avoid any contamination of a subsequent product with res-idues of a previous product, cleaning agents and microbi-al contaminants.A new EU GMP requires that limits for the maximum acceptable carry over (MACO) of product i.e. API\u2019s res-idues should be based on toxicological evaluation, PDE (permitted daily exposure) concept (EMA, 2014).There is a difference between the acceptance criteri-on usually used so far (1/1000 dose and 10 ppm), in ac-cordance with FDA\u2019s guidelines and the determination the MACO by the PDE concept. For residues where toxico-logical data is available, the MACO calculation should be based on the no observed effect level (NOEL). NOEL is the amount of drug in mg that does not have any effect on the human health and is calculated by using LD50 of the drug. The principle of MACO calculation is that the cal-culated acceptable carry-over from the previous product, based upon the PDE, is transferred into the next manufac-turing product (APIC, 2014; ECA, 2007). For the control of a cleaning procedure, a method suit-able for determination of the clarithromycin residues dur-ing the process of cleaning validation is needed.In this research a sensitive analytical method based on high performance liquid chromatography was adapted and validated to determine residues of clarithromycin in swab samples.Materials and methodsVarian HPLC System was used, equipped with Vari-an Prostar 240 pump, Varian 325 LC detector and Galax-ie1.9.301.220 software for data handling. The experiments were carried out by HPLC using Discovery C18, (125 x 4,6 mm i.d., 5\u03bcm) column. The HPLC system was operated at isocratic mode using mobile phase composed of buffer so-lution (30mM phosphate buffer pH 3.8 - 4.0) and methanol in ratio 35:65 (%). The temperature was 45\u00b0C, UV detec-tion was at 200 nm and injection volume 100 \u03bcL.The swabbing procedure was optimized in order to ob-tain a suitable recovery of clarithromycin from stainless steel surfaces. Using the head of AlphaTM Swab Texwipe previously rinsed with methanol, the predefined 25 cm2 surface area was wiped first in a horizontal and secondly in a vertical way, starting from the outside towards the centre.Results and discussionThe HPLC method was appropriately adapted and validated according to ICH guidelines (ICH, 2000a). The method was validated through determining these valida-tion characteristics: selectivity, linearity, precision, accura-cy, quantification limit and detection limit. Predetermined maximal levels of acceptability for clarithromycin residues were 21 ppm in samples and 17.3 \u03bcg/cm2 per surface area (LeBlanc, 2000). Achieved values for LOD of 0.59 \u00b5g/mL (ppm) and for LOQ of 1.9 \u00b5g/mL, indicate that the pro-posed HPLC method is enough sensitive for determining the established product residual limits.  Linearity was stud-ied in the concentration range 1 - 40 ppm, and the corre-lation coefficient (r2) = 0.9998 obtained for the regression line demonstrates the excellent relationship between peak area and the concentration of clarithromycin. The selectiv-ity was studied by comparing a blank solution and an clar-S2 PP 86190Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 189 - 190 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsithromycin test solution, which was prepared by wiping a stainless steel plate 5x5cm\u00b2 spiked with 10 \u03bcg/cm2  of clar-ithromycin according to optimized swabbing technique. The blank solution was prepared in the same way by wip-ing a clean plate. No sources of interference of the swab material were observed at the retention time of the analyte. As sensitive sampling methods require development and must be applicable to each specific piece of equipment used, swab recovery was determined using spiking studies incorporating coupons of equipment surfaces. The swab-bing procedure was optimized in order to obtain a suitable recovery of clarithromycin from stainless steel plates. The obtained \u201dswab recovery\u201d factor of 87.81% confirmed the appropriateness of the cleaning method, that recovery  was taken  into account in the results of cleaning validation.ConclusionHPLC method was developed and validated in order to determine residual amounts of clarithromycin after the cleaning procedure. The chromatographic technique was demonstrated to be sensitive, linear, accurate and precise in the concentration range studied. Direct sampling meth-od was optimized to obtain effective and reliable recov-eries. The detection limit for proposed liquid chromatog-raphy analytical method was sufficiently sensitive to de-tect the established acceptable level of the residues of clar-ithromycin.ReferencesEuropean Chemical Industry Council, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Committee (APIC), 2014.

Cilazapril is angiotensin-converting enzyme in-hibitor. Hydrochlorothiazide and cilazapril are antihyper-tensive drugs which can be used as monotherapy or in fixed combinations (Skolnik et al., 2000; Sweetman, 2009). Forced degradation studies are complementary part of drug development strategy being undertaken for identifica-tion of degradation products, to elucidate the degradation pathway and intrinsic stability of the drug. Investigation of degradation products formed under stress conditions is useful in development and validation of stability-indicat-ing procedures and it is also necessary due to changes in toxicity, bioavailability or therapeutic effects of the dos-age form (Alsante et al., 2007; ICH Q1A (R2), 2003; Kur-mi et al., 2014). To date, no information on stability of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide in therapeutic combination was found in the literature. Therefore, stability-indicating method was developed. In order to confirm its applicability in routine quality control of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide dos-age forms, robustness and other validation parameters of the established method have been investigated.Materials and methodsSatisfactorily chromatographic separation was achieved on Kinetex C18 (2.6 \u00b5m, 50 mm x 2.1 mm) col-umn (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, USA) with column tem-perature set to 25 \u00b0C with the mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and buffer solution (20 mM ammonium for-mate, pH adjusted to 8.5 with formic acid) and pumped at 400 \u03bcL/min flow rate in following gradient elution mode: initial composition was acetonitrile : buffer solution (5:95, v/v) and final composition was acetonitrile : buffer solution (35:65, v/v). Time of the gradient elution mode was 15.38 minutes. The detection was performed using PDA detec-tor at 215 nm, 250 nm and 270 nm. Cilazapril and hydro-chlorothiazide solutions were subjected to acidic (1.0 M HCl), basic (1.0 M NaOH), thermal (70 \u00b0C) and oxidative (15-30% H2O2) degradation and appropriate stress solu-tions were used during method development and meth-od selectivity investigation. Standard stock solutions of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide were prepared in con-centrations of 1000 \u00b5g/mL and standard stock solutions of cilazaprilat and hydrochlorothiazide impurity B were pre-pared in concentrations 200 \u00b5g/mL, separately by dissolv-ing standard substances in the mixture of acetonitrile-water (50:50, v/v). For method validation purposes, further dilu-tions of standard stock solutions were done with the mix-ture of acetonitrile and 20 mM ammonium formate buf-fer solution pH = 8.5 (20:80, v/v) in order to attain con-centrations in the following ranges: 50.00-150.00 \u00b5g/mL for cilazapril, 125.00-375.00 \u00b5g/mL for hydrochlorothia-zide, 0.50-1.50 \u00b5g/mL for cilazaprilat and 0.25-3.75 \u00b5g/mL for hydrochlorothiazide impurity B. Cilazil HCT\u00ae tab-lets (Pliva, Zagreb, Hrvatska) containing 5 mg of cilaza-pril monohydrate and 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide were purchased and used for validation.Results and discussionForced degradation studies on cilazapril and hydro-chlorothiazide active substances were conducted prior to method development in accordance with the ICH regulato-ry guidelines (ICH Q1A (R2), 2003). Cilazapril appeared S2 PP 87192Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 191 - 192 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsto be unstable towards acid and base hydrolysis which re-sulted in formation of cilazaprilat. Hydrochlorothiazide de-graded after acid, base and thermal hydrolysis and formed degradation product was hydrochlorothiazide impurity B. Both degradation products were already reported in offici-nal monographs of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide (Ph.Eur., 2011) as their related organic impurities. After oxida-tive degradation of both active substances, unknown prod-ucts arisen. The stability-indicating UHPLC-UV-MS method was developed. The experimental conditions that enabled sep-aration of cilazapril, hydrochlorothiazide and all of their degradation products were previously described. Method validation was carried out in accordance to ICH and FDA guidelines (Guidance for industry: Bioanalytical method validation, 2001; ICH Q2(R1), 2005).The selectivity of the method was confirmed by chromatographic screening for interfering substances. No interfering peaks were present in the chromatogram of dosage form sample at the reten-tion times of cilazapril, hydrochlorothiazide, cilazaprilat, hydrochlorothiazide impurity B and unknown degradation products that were recorded in the chromatograms of stress samples. The method robustness was considered during the method development and optimization procedure. Initial percentage of acetonitrile in mobile phase, final percentage of acetonitrile in mobile phase, time of gradient elution and column temperature were defined as critical variables. In-vestigated responses were retention factors of degradation products of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide denoted as k283.6 and k429.9, respectively, as the first and the last elut-ing substances. Initial percentage of acetonitrile in mobile phase and column temperature demonstrated more signif-icant influence on observed responses while the influenc-es of final percentage of acetonitrile in mobile phase and time of gradient elution was less significant. Small chang-es in value variables did not jeopardize responses of inves-tigated substances. The concentration range for testing of the lineari-ty of the method was: 50.00-150.00 \u00b5g/mL for cilazapril, 125.00-375.00 \u00b5g/mL for hydrochlorothiazide, 0.50-1.50 \u00b5g/mL for cilazaprilat and 0.25-3.75 \u00b5g/mL for hydrochlo-rothiazide impurity B. The calculated calibration equa-tions were y=29.7081x+18.9990, y=83.4604x+2180.4154, y=7.0676x-2.2344 and y=6.3525x+0.1990 for cilazapril, hydrochlorothiazide, cilazaprilat and hydrochlorothiazide impurity B, respectively. The correlation coefficients were 0.9999, 0.9998, 0.9977 and 0.9959 for cilazapril, hydro-chlorothiazide, cilazaprilat, hydrochlorothiazide impurity B, respectively and they indicated that the relationship be-tween peak area and the concentration was linear over in-vestigated concentration range. Experimentally determined value of limit of quantifi-cation for cilazaprilat and hydrochlorothiazide impurity B were 0.5 \u00b5g/mL and 0.25 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The precision of the method was considered as intra-assay and it was performed in six repetitive measurements where concentration levels were: 100 \u00b5g/mL for cilaza-pril, 250 \u00b5g/mL for hydrochlorothiazide, 1.0 \u00b5g/mL for cilazaprilat and 2.5 \u00b5g/mL for hydrochlorothiazide impu-rity B. Results were expressed as relative standard devia-tion values which were 0.35%, 0.25%, 4.61% and 3.23% for cilazapril, hydrochlorothiazide, cilazaprilat and hydro-chlorothiazide impurity B, respectively.ConclusionStability profile of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide was established and stability-indicating method was devel-oped. The method showed good robustness and met all val-idation criteria.ReferencesAlsante, K.M., Ando, A., Brown, R., Ensing, J., Hatajik, T.D., Kong, W., Tsuda, Y., 2007.

It is monohydrochloride salt of 1-cyclopropyl-7-[(S,S)-2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl]-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3 quino-line carboxylic acid (RxList, 2016). The analytical meth-ods for its determination in pharmaceutical dosage forms are not so numerous and can be categorized generally into two groups: nonseparative UV-Vis spectroscopic methods, zero order (Dhumal et al., 2011; Sahu et al., 2011) or de-rivative (Dhumal et al., 2011) and separative, dominantly chromatographic methods (Abdelaziz et al., 2012; Dewani et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2014). These cited HPLC meth-ods for quantification of moxifloxacin, found during liter-ature search, show some unwanted features like skewed or asymmetric peaks and excessive retention achieved with 250 mm long columns. Above presented facts prompted us to develop HPLC method for fast, simple, accurate, reproducible and rugged quantification of moxifloxacin in solid pharmaceutical dos-age forms.Materials and methodsThe chemicals were Ph.Eur. grade. Potassium dihydro-gen phosphate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, dipro-pylamine and 85% phosphoric acid were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich, USA, whereas methanol was purchased from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. The demineral-ized water was Stilman produced and had conductivity less than 1 \u00b5S. Moxifloxacin working standard and Moxiflox-acin film-coated tablets 400 mg were purchased from Re-plek Farm, Skopje, Macedonia. The experiments were performed on three HPLC sys-tems: Varian Prostar with DAD 330 detector controlled with Varian Star software version 6.21, UPLC Dionex with four-channel UV-Vis detector controlled with Chromeleon ver-sion 6.8 and UPLC Shimadzu Nexera with dual-channel UV-Vis detector controlled with Lab Solutions version 5.54.Following HPLC columns were tested: - RP Select B 125 mm x 4 mm, 5 \u00b5m (Merck Darm-stadt, Germany);- Discovery C8 150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m (Supelco Bellefonte, USA);- Discovery C18 100 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m (Supelco Bellefonte, USA);- Discovery C18 125 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m (Supelco Bellefonte, USA).The test and standard solutions were prepared by dis-solving suitable amount of the active substance or pow-dered film-coated tablets in methanol or water to obtain concentrations in the range of 0.1 - 0.5 mg/mL.Results and discussionThe characteristic UV-absorption spectrum of moxi-floxacin with maximum at 293 nm permits use of almost all commonly used buffers in chromatography. Consider-ing moxifloxacin pKa values (pKa1=6.25 and pKa2=9.29) (Lanqlois et al., 2005) and its well documented solubility in more polar solvents, phosphate buffers with pH value 3 S2 PP 88194Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 193 - 194 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsin combination with methanol as mobile phase were used. Two different phosphate buffers, 25-30 mM NH4H-2PO4 and KH2PO4 with pH=3 were tested. Slight insignifi-cant advantage was given to ammonium dihydrogen phos-phate compared to potassium dihydrogen phosphate, when peak symmetries were compared. The mobile phases were tested without and with added dipropylamine as a peak symmetry corrector by suppressing the ion-exchange inter-action of residual silanol groups with protonated N-atoms in analyte molecule. The addition of 0.2% v/v dipropyl-amine in 25 mM ammonium  dihydrogen phosphate at pH 3 improved the peak symmetry from 1.47 to 1.25. Fluoroquinolones with their characteristic molecule structure are well known to chromatographists as prob-lematic with yielding tailing peaks on the chromatograms, usually corrected with use of high percentage of amines in mobile phase composition, up to 1 - 2% v/v. This prompt-ed our investigation, to choose chromatographic column which has high quality end-capped silica particles with lowest content of residual metal cations.Toward aiming the goal, two C8-octylsilane columns and two C18-octadecylsilane columns from the same man-ufacturer but with different dimensions were tested. The comparison of the chromatograms obtained with C8 and C18 columns from identical vendors showed that no significant preferences could be noticed. Both C8 and C18 can create perfect peak of moxifloxacin which can be fine adjusted with retention needed. It was clearly seen that lowering the percentage of methanol from 55% v/v to 40% v/v increases the peak retention and symmetry. Slight pref-erence from the peak symmetry and less organic consump-tion point of view in our experiments showed C8 filled col-umns, that yielded moxifloxacin peak with t5% = 1.15. This fact generally does not prefer C8 over C18 columns, since peak symmetry could be sacrificed in aim to improve resolution, which is more important in chromatographic separations. Depending on the sample constituents com-plexity and target system suitability demands of the chro-matographic method, C8 and C18 could be successfully in-terchanged and optimized for all demands. C8 reversed phase column has stronger hydrophobic interactions than Phenyl-RP columns but weaker than C18. The HPLC method for related compounds of moxifloxacin, described in Ph.Eur.8 (2014) uses Phenyl-bonded RP col-umn with TBAH cationic ion pair reagent in mobile phase, and it shows relatively close elution of related compounds with moxifloxicin. This is expected to be improved with use of more retentive C18 column.The use of chromatographic columns having particles with wide pores also showed to be advantage in our in-vestigations. Discovery C8 columns have pores with about 180 nm diameter, whereas RP Select B columns have 60 nm pores diameter, and generate wide skewed and distort-ed peak of moxifloxacin. Discovery columns are better end-capped and more base-deactivated, which was shown to be advantage dur-ing our method development. Finally, the proposed chromatographic conditions for the optimized method for quantification of moxifloxacin are: mobile phase composed of 25 mM NH4H2PO4 pH=3 and methanol (65% : 35%, v/v), with flow rate 1.1 ml/min, HPLC column Discovery C8 150 mm x 4.6 mm with 5 \u00b5m particles, thermostated at 35 \u00b0C, detection wavelength at 293 nm and injection volume of 5 \u00b5l. Moxifloxacin peak elutes for less than 5 minutes with symmetry expressed as AsUSP ~1.2.ConclusionThe proposed method is fast, simple cost-effective, re-producible and rugged, intended for high-throughput rou-tine assay analysis of moxifloxacin in solid pharmaceutical dosage forms. It can be further optimized and improved, using columns with different properties, better retention and selectivity, or changed ratio of mobile phase constit-uent, in order to achieve better retention of moxifloxacin peak and better resolution from its degradation products in order to make it suitable for use during stability testing of the pharmaceutical formulations.

Its IUPAC name is 1-eth-yl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3-quino-linecarboxylic acid (RxList, 2016). Majority of fluoroqui-nolone molecules, especially norfloxacin, are well known as problematic in terms of peak shape appearing on the chromatograms. They are often obtained as highly asym-metric, tailing peaks with calculated values of symmetry factor of about 2 or even greater. This fact complicates and compromises method accuracy based on the difficulties in determination of peak end on baseline. These problems are frequently solved with use of expensive high quality HPLC columns with double and triple end-capped bond-ed reversed phase silica matrixes and extensive base-deac-tivation of metal cations from silica particles. British Phar-macopoeial monograph (BP, 2013) for norfloxacin active pharmaceutical ingredient assay determination prescribes use of C16 column with gradient elution with water acidi-fied to pH ~2 and acetonitrile at high column temperature of 60 \u00b0C and for norfloxacin tablets acidic isocratic elu-tion with 0.1% v/v o-H3PO4 and acetonitrile with previous washing of column with different buffer, for 8 hours.Many different methods are published (Bera et al., 2014; Chierentin and Salgado, 2013; Oliveira et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2013) for norfloxacin determination in phar-maceutical dosage form. All of them conflict with the men-tioned problem of peak symmetry of norfloxacin and this problem is differently eliminated with use of amines, gra-dient elutions, high column temperatures, expensive high quality columns employment etc.The aim of our study was to develop fast, simple ac-curate and robust HPLC method for determination of nor-floxacin in pharmaceutical dosage forms, yielding chro-matographic peak of norfloxacin with satisfying symme-try, without using gradient elution, high column tempera-tures and expensive high quality columns.Materials and methodsAmmonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4), 85% phosphoric acid and potassium hexafluorophos-phate (KPF6) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich, USA, whereas methanol, acetonitrile and 70 % perchloric acid (HClO4) were purchased from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. All the chemicals used were Ph.Eur. grade. The demineralized water was Stilman produced and had con-ductivity less than 1 \u00b5S.Common HPLC system was used, Varian Pro Star sys-tem with autosampler 410, Varian 325 dual-channel and Varian 335 photodiode-array detector, with ternary high pressure mixing pump, controlled by Galaxy software ver-sion 1.91.Following two chromatographic columns were tested: RP Select B 75 mm x 4 mm, 5 \u00b5m and RP Select B 125 mm x 4 mm, 5 \u00b5m, both products of Merck Darmstadt, Germany.Norfloxacin working standard and Norfloxacin film-coated tablets 400 mg were purchased from Replek Farm, Skopje, Macedonia.Test and standard solutions were prepared by dissolv-S2 PP 89196Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 195 - 196 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsing suitable content of the active substance or powdered film-coated tablets in solvent composed of 5% v/v aceto-nitrile and 95% v/v 0.1% v/v H3PO4, to concentration of 0.4 mg/ml.Results and discussionDuring development of appropriate chromatograph-ic method for quantification of norfloxacin with improved peak symmetry, we intended to investigate influence of participation of chaotropic salts in mobile phase constitu-tion. For this investigation we decided to use lower quality reversed HPLC column, RP Select B with two dimensions 75 mm x 4mm and 125 mm x 4 mm, with 5 \u00b5m particles, manufactured by Merck Darmstadt, Germany. These col-umns have a matrix which is single end-capped and partial-ly base-deactivated silica particles with small, 60 nm wide pores. With these characteristics RP Select B is not appro-priate choice for column in chromatographic method for norfloxacin determination, but use of this column should better manifest the influence of appropriate mobile phase on peak symmetry.We performed two tests of same column matrix of RP Select B with different dimensions:1. Using RP Select B 75 mm x 4 mm with 5 \u00b5m par-ticles, mobile phase flow rate of 1.1 ml/min, chromato-graphic column temperature of 32 \u00b0C, injection volume of 5 \u00b5l, UV detection at 277 nm, and mobile phase consisted of 30% v/v methanol and 70% v/v mixture of 0.13% w/v NH4H2PO4, 0.2% w/v KPF6 and 0.1% v/v HClO4 with pH value 2.39. The chromatogram obtained under these conditions showed norfloxacin peak with retention time ~2.9 minutes, height ~570 mAU and symmetry expressed as AsUSP ~1.25.2. Using RP Select B 125 mm x 4 mm with 5 \u00b5m par-ticles, mobile phase flow rate of 1.0 ml/min chromato-graphic column temperature of 30 \u00b0C, injection volume of 5 \u00b5l, UV detection at 277 nm, and mobile phase consisted of 35% v/v methanol and 65% v/v mixture of 0.13% w/v NH4H2PO4, 0.2% w/v KPF6 and 0.1% v/v HClO4 with pH value 2.39.The chromatogram obtained under these conditions showed norfloxacin peak with retention time ~3.75 min-utes, height ~560 mAU and symmetry expressed as AsUSP ~ 1.2.With these results, the peak symmetry and retention correction features of potent chaotropes like KPF6 was confirmed as beneficial. In our case, peak retention was not a primary problem. The main problem was the peak sym-metry. According to theory and publication of Kazakievic and Lobrutto (2007), the beneficial features of the chaotrop KPF6 are more significant with use of acetonitrile instead of methanol. But in our case, use of KPF6 chaotrop showed much better peak symmetry correction benefit, than ex-tended peak retention. Other important thing to mention is that use of 0.1% v/v HClO4 contributes to peak symmetry too, since the ClO4- anions are also chaotropic, but in less-er extent than PF6- anions.Further improvements of peak symmetry and reten-tion can be achieved with increase of content of chaotropic agent KPF6, but it is not necessary to extent run time for insignificant increase of peak symmetry. Better peak sym-metry can be achieved with use of more expensive, new, high end-capped and well base-deactivated columns. Use of wider particle pore column is preferential when com-pared with 60 nm pores of RP Select B column.ConclusionNew approach in creating fast, simple, accurate and robust RP-HPLC method was developed, which is very useful in high-throughput analysis per day, in pharmaceu-tical quality control routine analysis of norfloxacin phar-maceutical dosage forms. Method can be further adjusted and adapted for other intents of analysis, bioequivalence testing, pharmacodynamic, forensic analysis and similar.ReferencesBera, K.A., De, K.A., Pal, B., 2014.

It is necessary to perform these studies in process of develop-ment the stability indicating method which can be applied latter for the analysis of samples generated from accelerat-ed and long term stability studies in proposed shelf life to ensure that all possible degradation products that may oc-cur in proposed shelf life in normal conditions of storage can be separated, detected and quantified (Djurdjevic et al., 2009; Singh  et al., 2014; Sultana et al., 2011).Moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation antibiotic drug of the fluoroquinolone familly, with higher activity against Gram-positive pathogens including Streptococcus pneu-monie, than the other drugs from fluoroquinolone family (Dewania et al., 2011; Lalitha Devi and Chandrasekhar, 2009).The objective of the present study was to report the sta-bility of moxifloxacin in tablet formulations available on the local market, based on the information obtained from forced degradation studies, to develop and validate new stability-indicating HPLC method for quantitative analy-sis of moxifloxacin and its related substances in pharma-ceutical dosage form tablet and to develop LC-MS method for the characterization of new degradation products in ac-cordance with the information obtained from forced degra-dation studies. Materials and methodsThree different tablet formulations (Formulation A: MOXI film tablets 400 mg-ZADA Pharmaceuticals, For-mulation B: AVELOX film tablets 400 mg-Bayer, Formu-lation C: CENOMAR film tablets 400 mg-Hemofarm), purchased from the local market were tested. European Pharmacopoeia Reference Standards Moxifloxacin hy-drochloride CRS and Moxifloxacin for peak identification CRS were used. Analytically pure moxifloxacin was ob-tained from Nosch Laboratories Limited, India. All chemi-cals and reagents used were of HPLC-grade purity.A High Performance Liquid Chromatographic system (Thermo Surveyor HPLC) equipped with Finnigan Sur-veyor LC quaternary pump, Finnigan Surveyor Autosam-pler plus, Finnigan Surveyor PDA plus detector in isocrat-ic mode was used for the analysis.Experimental design was used to optimize experimen-tal conditions. The method was optimized by analysis of the samples generated during the forced degradation stud-ies. Experimental factors, independent variables, were se-lected as inputs and as dependent variables were study res-olution between typical peaks and retention factor of moxi-floxacin because latest eluted. To assess the impact of some experimental factors on the responses of the system it was applied central compos-ite design. The optimal chromatographic conditions were selected by calculating Desirability function.After optimizing the experimental conditions the sep-aration was conducted on a ZORBAX-SB Phenyl column (250x4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size) with mobile phase com-posed of methanol:buffer (0.5 g/L tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate, 1.0 g/L monobasic potassium dihydro-gen phosphate and 3.4 g/L phosphoric acid in water) in ra-tio 71:29, v/v; pumped at 1.5 ml/min flow rate. The column temperature was set at 50 \u00b0C and the detection at 293 nm using Diode Array Detector. LC-MS method was developed for characterization of degradation products using HYPERSIL GOLD PFP 150x4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm column with mobile phase composed S2 PP 90198Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 197 - 198 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsof ammonium formate (20mM): acetonitril pH=4; (70:30, v/v ) pumped at 1 ml/min flow rate. The column tempera-ture was set at 25 \u00b0C and the detection at 295 nm using Di-ode Array Detector. The medicine was subjected to acid (4 mol/l HCl, 70 \u00b0C for 6 days) and base (4 mol/l NaOH, 50 \u00b0C for 6 days) hydrolysis, oxidative decomposition (3% H2O2), thermal and photolytic stress. Forced degradation studies were conducted on the ac-tive substance, placebo mixture and binary mixtures of moxifloxacin with the excipients from the tablet formula-tions, in the same stress conditions, to determine the origin of the formed degradation products.Results and discussionNew LC-MS compatible stability-indicating HPLC method for moxifloxacin was developed. Significant deg-radation was caused by acidic and basic conditions. The results were comparable in all tested tablet formulations. In the samples without stress impurities were not detected.Under basic conditions  (4 mol/l NaOH, 50 \u00b0C for 6 days) two degradation products have been detected (RRT 0.5 min. and 0.6 min.) in all three tested tablet formulations. Under acidic conditions (4 mol/l HCl, 70 \u00b0C for 6 days) one degradation product (RRT 0.8 min.) was detect-ed with significant area in all three tablet formulations. In formulation B it one additional degradation product on RRT 1.3 min. was detected, while in formulation C two ad-ditional degradation products (RRT 0.4 min. and 1.3 min.) were detected.It was found that the degradation products formed in the presence of base are result of the interaction between moxifloxacin and excipients in the tablet formulation: lac-tose and cellulose, while the degradation products caused by acidic conditions are performed as a result of degrada-tion of the active substance moxifloxacin. Composition of formulation A and B included cellu-lose and lactose, while formulation C had only cellulose in its composition. All degradation products were identi-fied as unknown.ConclusionAn isocratic stability-indicating RP-HPLC method for quantification of moxifloxacin and its related substances in moxifloxacin tablets was optimized and validated. LC-MS method was found to be suitable for separation of deg-radation products formed under stress conditions. In all of the three tested tablet formulations unknown degradation products were found, which need to be identified.The developed LC-MS method can be used for fu-ture research which objective will be the identification of formed degradation products.ReferencesDewani, A.P., Barik, B.B., Kanungo, S.K., Wattyani, B.R.

DZP is also routinely prescribed as the standard first-line treatment for acute convulsions and pro-longed status epilepticus (Martindale, 2009). Several meth-ods for the analysis of BZDs have been reported. A num-ber of chromatographic methods such as: thin-layer chro-matography (TLC) (Hancu et al., 2011), gas chromatog-raphy and gas chromatographic\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) (Kudi et al., 1988) have been used in the analysis of DZP and other 1,4-benzodiazopines. Several high-perfor-mance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods have also been reported for the determination of diazepam and oth-er BZDs (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2012; Moros et al., 2007). Ben-zyl alcohol (BA) is used as an antimicrobial preservative in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products and its concen-tration should not exceed limit values for each formulation type because it could produce fatal toxic effects, allergies and various other effects on the nervous system (Martin-dale, 2009). Benzyl alcohol is quantitatively estimated in raw material and pharmaceutical preparations by gas chro-matography, derivative spectrophotometry, HPLC, am-perometric enzyme electrode, polarography des and cap-illary electrokinetic chromatography (Khade et al., 2014; Sen, 2011). To the best of our knowledge no analytical method is available for the simultaneous determination of DZP and BA in pharmaceutical preparations. Therefore, it was considered necessary to develop a HPLC method for the quantification of these compounds in pharmaceutical dosage forms. We wish to describe a simple, rapid, eco-nomical and accurate method of analysis using reversed-phase HPLC to simultaneously determine DZP  and BA in microclismes.Materials and methodsThe chromatographic analysis was performed using DionexUltiMate 3000 UHPLC focused. The HPLC grade acetonitrile was developed using ReproSil-Pur 120 C4, 150 x 4,6 mm, 3,0 \u00b5m  chromatographic column with mobile phase containing a mixture of 0.1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid in water and acetonitrile in the ratio of 70:30 v/v, re-spectively. Isocratic method was used with runtime of 10 minute. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.5 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 35\u00b0C and the eluted compounds were monitored at the wavelength of 254 nm. The injection volume was 20 \u03bcL. A standards stock solution of DZP and BA were prepared in metha-nol with a concentration of 2 mg/mL and 0.015 mL/mL. Working standard solutions were prepared from  stock so-lutions by further dilution with water. The sample solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mL solution of microclisme in a 50 mL volumetric flask (US bath for 7 min) and dilut-ing with water to volume. The sample solution was filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m PTFE membrane filter.Results and discussionThe proposed method was validated as per ICH guide-line (ICH, 2003). The following validation characteristics were addressed:  suitability, specificity, precision,  lineari-ty,  accuracy, and robustness.System suitability was checked for the conformance of suitability and reproducibility of chromatographic sys-S2 PP 91200Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 199 - 200 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationstem for analysis. The system suitability was evaluated on the basis of USP capacity factor, tailing factor and theo-retical plates of DZ and BA and relative standard devia-tion (RSD) of six injections of standard solution. Sys-tem suitability was determined before sample analysis. The acceptance criteria were % RSD should not be more than 2.0%, USP tailing factor should less than 2.0 and the-oretical plate should be more than 3000 for DZ and BA peak from standard solutions. All critical parameters test-ed met the acceptance criteria [kDZ\u2019=5.35  kBA\u2019=1.14, AsDZP=1.4 and AsBA=1.1, NDZP=4800 and NBA=4253, RSDDZP=0.001  and  RSDBA=0.0017). Specificity study to establish the interference of placebo was conducted. Study was performed on Placebo (Placebo contains excipi-ents without DZP and BA). Chromatogram of placebo had shown no peaks at the retention time of DZP and BA, indi-cating that the excipients used in the formulation do not in-terferewith the estimation of DZP and BA. The precision of the method was verified by repeatability and intermediate precision at three concentration levels (DZP: 0.017 mg/mL to 0.023 mg/mL and BA: 0.118 \u00b5L/mL to 0.162 \u00b5L/mL). The intermediate precision of the method was also evaluat-ed using different analyst and different instrument and per-forming the analysis on different days. The RSD (%) of re-sult for DZP and BA was calculated. The % RSD for the result of DZP in was within 0.65% and in intermediate pre-cision study was within 0.28%, The % RSD for the result of BA in was within 0.63% and in intermediate precision study was within 0.29%, which confirms the good preci-sion of the method. Linearity test solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solutions to the required concentra-tions by covering the range from 0.014 to 0.026 mg/mL of DZP and 0.098 to 0.182 \u00b5L/mL of BA. Calibration curves were plotted between the responses of peak versus ana-lyte concentrations. The correlation coefficient obtained was greater than 0.999 (for DZP is 0.9995 and for BA is 0.9992). The above result shows that an excellent correla-tion existed between peak area and concentration of DZP and BA. Accuracy of the method was evaluated in triplicate using three concentrations levels (80%, 100% and 120%) and confirmed by calculated recovery values. The percent-age recoveries for DZP and BA were calculated and varied from 98.76 to 101.50 for DZP and from 98.15 to 101.96 for BA. To determine the robustness of the developed method, experimental conditions were deliberately altered and sys-tem suitability (SST) parameters for DZP and BA standard were recorded. The variables evaluated during the robust-ness testing were: composition of the mobile phase, col-umn temperature and flow rate. The obtained results have shown that the method is robust for experimental variation of composition of the mobile phase and column tempera-ture, but it is not robust for the change of the flow rate. Re-covery value lies in the proper range of from 95% to 105%, ie. RSD does not deviate by more than \u00b1 5% (RSD=0.64% for diazepam, RSD=0.49% of benzyl alcohol). ConclusionA simple and efficient reverse-phase HPLC meth-od was developed and validated for quantitative analy-sis of DZP and BA inmicroclisme as pharmaceutical dos-age forms. The method found to be precise, accurate, lin-ear, robust and rugged during validation. The method could be used for routine analysis of production samples and to check the stability of the DZ and BA.References\u010cudina, O.A., \u010comor, M.I., Jankovi\u0107, I.A., 2005.

Cyril and Methodius\u201d, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* vpetrusevski@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionDeveloping GC-MS methods for chemical character-ization of pharmaceutical packaging materials presents significant challenge, since the sheer number of additives and their degradation products that can be found in packag-ing materials and subsequently separated and detected with this technique is enormous (Jenke, 2009). These methods need to be capable of simultaneous separation and detec-tion of aliphatic fatty acids, alcohols, amides and their de-rivatives, compounds that are traditionally difficult to sep-arate and detect, due to the large similarity in structure and their physico-chemical properties.The aim of this paper was to develop a GC method for chemical characterization of semi-volatile additives and their degradation products in packaging materials for phar-maceutical use.The GC method was developed using a commercial-ly available system suitability mixture (Grob Test Mix), containing 11 compounds that belong to different chemi-cal groups of compounds, which was suitable for the in-tended approach to develop a method that will be simulta-neously capable of separation of different groups of pack-aging additives.Materials and methodsDevelopment was made using Grob DA 280 Column Test Mix (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, USA). The mixture is composed of 11 compounds (n-Decane (C10), Methyl dec-anoate (C10:0), n-Undecane (C11), Methyl undecanoate (C11:0), Methyl dodecanoate (C12:0), L(+)-2,3-Butanedi-ol, 2,6-Dimethylaniline, 2,6-Dimethylphenol, 2-Ethylhex-anoic acid, Nonanal and 1-Octanol), dissolved in methy-lene chloride (DCM). All experiments were performed on Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus gas chromatograph and Agilent 7890B gas chro-matograph equipped with Agilent 5977A single quadru-pole mass spectrometer. MS identification of the detected compounds was performed by AMDIS spectral deconvo-lution and comparison of spectra with NIST library, using MassHunter software. For those compounds where library match was low, attempts to establish compound\u2019s identity were made via mechanistic fragment predictions of avail-able spectral data, using MassFrontier v7.0 software.Results and discussionThe development of the chromatographic conditions started using a non-polar GC WCOT chromatographic col-umn (Agilent DB-5 ms; 30m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u03bcm), with helium as carrier gas at 2 ml/min (constant velocity, which has the advantage over constant pressure mode toward the end of the run, where increase in temperature would other-wise drastically reduce the flow, leading to prolonged run-time and reduced sensitivity because of decrease of col-umn efficiency). The following temperature gradient con-ditions were chosen for initial separation of the Grob Test Mix: 40 \u00b0\u0421 (hold 2 minutes), 10 \u00b0\u0421/min to 330 \u00b0\u0421 (hold 10 minutes), injector temperature was set at 250 \u00b0\u0421 and injec-tion volume of 1 \u00b5L with split ratio of 1:10. Evaluation of the chromatograms quickly revealed that the method con-ditions aren\u2019t capable of separating the mixture, with mul-tiple co-elutions observed.In order to achieve specificity of the method, optimi-S2 PP 92202Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl)  201 - 202 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationszation of the conditions by variation of the carrier gas flow and temperature gradient was attempted. Besides the im-provement in the separation of the components, is was found to be impossible to separate two critical pairs of compounds (n-undecane and n-nonanal; 2,6-dimethylphe-nol and 2-ethylhexanoic acid), even with extreme gradi-ent changes.A change in the stationary phase chemistry was the next logical step, therefore the Agilent DB-5 column was replaced with a non-polar Rxi-1 column (Rxi-1 MS 30m x 0.25mm x 0.25\u03bcm, Restek Corp., Bellefonte, USA), with the idea to promote different interactions between the sta-tionary phase and the components from the critical pairs. The change in column chemistry proved to be successful, and minor changes to the temperature gradient conditions yielded complete baseline separation of all components from the Grob DA 280 Column Test Mix. The final chro-matographic conditions were defined as: flow: 2 ml/min (constant flow); temperature gradient: 60 \u00b0\u0421 (hold 2 min-utes), 10 \u00b0\u0421/min to 80 \u00b0\u0421 (hold 2 minutes), 3 \u00b0\u0421/min to 100 \u00b0\u0421, 25 \u00b0\u0421/min to 310 \u00b0\u0421 (hold 10 minutes); injection vol-ume: 1 \u00b5L; split ratio: 1:5. The injector temperature was in-creased to 310 \u00b0\u0421 to obtain faster evaporation of the sam-ple, better sensitivity and reduced peak width.Besides the components from Grob DA 280 Column Test Mix, stearic acid and erucamide (cis-13 docosen-amide) were chromatographically evaluated, and proved to be completely separated from the rest of the components from the Grob DA 280 Column Test Mix. These two com-pounds were evaluated not only because they are frequent-ly used additives in the packaging materials, but also be-cause they are candidate molecules for derivatization in gas chromatography.Detection of the separated components was simulta-neously performed with FID and MS detector using post-column splitter valve, in accordance with PQRI\u2019s recom-mendations (PQRI Leachables and Extractables Working Group 2006) to reduce the chances of missing an extracted compound, due to detector type specificities.Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) plastics were evaluated by generating a number of ex-tracts in water buffers, methanol and hexane and analyzed using the proposed method. Both detectors showed equiv-alent responses (as a number of detected compounds), us-ing their default parameters, with the methanol and hexane extracts showing highest numbers of detected components of all extracts.ConclusionGas chromatography is extremely important technique for analysis of extractables and leachables, due to the fact that it enables efficient separation and detection of an enor-mous number of organic compounds commonly encoun-tered in packaging materials. Coupling gas chromatogra-phy with MS detection further enhances its capabilities to-ward identification of the detected compounds, giving a clearer picture of the additives profile of the tested mate-rial.ReferencesJenke, D., 2009.

It is pharmacologically similar to gabapentin. Pregabalin is ap-proved for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neural-gia and for adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures. This drug has a specific chemical structure, without presence of any specific UV-chromophore, like, for exam-ple, cyclic structure with double bonds, absorptive group or bond in the molecule, which complicates its detection with UV absorbing detectors. Patil et al. (2015) have developed spectrophotometric method for determination of Pregabalin, based on conden-sation reaction of Pregabalin with p-dimethylaminobenz-aldehyde in an acidic medium, leading to formation of a complex that shows maximum absorbtion at 395.80 nm.  There are also many HPLC methods with UV detec-tion. Some of them require precolumn chemical derivatiza-tion of Pregabalin, using 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as derivatiozation agent (Ahmadkhaniha et al., 2014). How-ever, their application for routine pharmaceutical quali-ty control of drug products is difficult and inappropriate. Among the other common HPLC/UV methods developed for this aim, the following deficiencies can be met: low ca-pacity peak (Kasawar and Farooqui, 2010), inappropriate UV absorbing mobile phase components having lowUV-cut off, such as ammonium acetate buffer (Balaji et al., 2014), highly asymmetric peaks (Ashu et al., 2011; Kanna-pan et al., 2010) and even not-acceptable declared sensitiv-ity (Saeed et al., 2014).The aim of this work was to overcome above men-tioned obstacles, and to develop HPLC method for Prega-balin determination in solid pharmaceutical dosage forms, for routine analysis, in quality control laboratories, in phar-maceutical industry. Materials and methodsAll the chemicals used were Ph.Eur grade. Acetoni-trile and sodium hydroxide were products of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, whereas potassium dihydrogen phos-phate and 37% hydrochloric acid was purchased from Sig-ma  Aldrich, USA. The demineralized water was Stilman produced and had conductivity less than 1 \u00b5S. Pregabalin capsules and Pregabalin working standard were purchased from Replek Farm, Skopje, Macedonia.Analyzes were conducted on HPLC system Varian Prostar with ternary high pressure mixing pump, autosam-pler 410 with column oven and DAD 330 detector con-trolled by Varian Star software version 6.21 and UPLC sys-tem Shimadzu Nexera with low pressure mixing quaterna-ry pump, autosampler, column oven, controller and dual-channel UV-Vis detector, controlled by Lab Solutions soft-ware version 5.54. Following HPLC columns were used: - Hypersil C18 ODS 100 mm x 4 mm, 3 \u00b5m (Thermo scientific, USA); - RP Select B 75 mm x 4 mm, 5 \u00b5m (Merck Darmstadt, Germany);S2 PP 93204Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 203 - 204 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentations- Purospher C18e STAR 125 mm x 4 mm, 5 \u00b5m (Merck Darmstadt, Germany);- Discovery C18 125 mm x 4,6 mm, 5 \u00b5m (Su-pelco Bellefonte, USA).The final proposed chromatographic conditions are: Discovery C18 chromatographic column, mobile phase consisted of 7% v/v acetonitrile and 93% v/v of 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) with flow rate 1.0 mL/min, column tem-perature 30 \u03bfC and 20 \u00b5L injection volume.Test solution was prepared by dissolving 1 capsule in 500 mL volumetric flack and diluted with 0.1 M hydro-chloric acid to volume.Results and discussionThe choice of HPLC column had strong impact on Pre-gabalin peak height, shape and capacity. Therefore, during method development four different HPLC columns were tested: 3 \u00b5m particle column Hypersil C18 ODS, RP Select B with 5 \u00b5m, Purospher C18e STAR with 5 \u00b5m and Dis-covery C18 with 5 \u00b5m particles. Best results were achieved using Discovery C18 column matrix, which was somewhat expected from particles having 180 nm wide pores, well base deactivated (metal cations purified) and end-capped of free silanol groups of silica chromatographic matrix. Pu-rospher columns have highest purity (lowest quantity of metal cations) chromatographic matrix but the wide pore particles of Discovery yield higher and narrower peak of Pregabaline, which makes this column more appropriate for achieving good sensitivity of the method.Increasing the injection volume was another way to im-prove sensitivity, accompanied by creation of deeper base-line disturbances even when highly UV transparent mo-bile phase composition was used. Similarity between sam-ple solvent and mobile phase improved the chromatogram appearance, since the presence of water in sample always generates deep negative peaks when working at very low UV wavelength signal. It is essential to dissolve the sam-ple in mobile phase in aim to avoid negative peaks on the whole picture of chromatogram.  Additionally, the method sensitivity could be decreased if the sample is additionally diluted with water or mobile phase. The use of UV-DAD detector enabled comparison of the increase of method sensitivity by lowering monitoring wave-length from 215 nm up to 200 nm. It was found out that sig-nal monitoring wavelength at 210 nm was adequate for most types of pharmaceutical analysis of Pregabalin in solid phar-maceuticals, i.e. for assay and dissolution determination. Pregabalin molecule has two pKa values, 4.2 and 10.6, corresponding to the carboxylic acid and the amine groups, respectively. Mobile phase buffer with pH = 7.0 was tested and yielded satisfying chromatohraphic peaks of the analyte with retention time ~ 2 - 5 minutes depending on the HPLC column characteristics and length and the exact ratio of the inorganic and organic part in the mobile phase composition. The optimal chromatographic conditions were ob-tained using Discovery C18 chromatographic column, mo-bile phase consisted of 7% v/v acetonitrile and 93% v/v of 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), and 20 \u00b5L injection volume. ConclusionThe method was found to be simple, fast and cost-ef-fective, thus suitable for high-throughput routine determi-nation of Pregabalin in solid dosage forms in pharmaceuti-cal quality control laboratories. The method could be fur-ther improved if needed for higher sensitivity and higher throughput of analysis per day. ReferencesAhmadkhaniza, R., Mottaghi, S., Zargarpoor, Souri, E., 2014.

Its chemical name is 5,6-dimeth-yl-benzimidazoyl cyanocobamide. It belongs to a group of cobalt-containing compounds, known as corrinoids (Eiten-miller et al., 2007; Hurst, 2002; NCBI). Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) functions as a coenzyme. It is involved in the red blood cells formation and nervous system functioning, in DNA synthesis and regulation, and also in fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 is synthesized only by bacteria and it is pres-ent only in food bacterially fermented or obtained from an-imals that has this cobalamin from their gastrointestinal microflora (Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Commit-tee, 1998). Microbiological method is one of the oldest methods for measuring the concentration of Vitamin B12. Although this technique has developed through time, still it has sev-eral drawbacks such as: relatively low specificity, low pre-cision, it is time consuming and requires very well trained technicians. Several authors have developed different HPLC meth-ods for determination of Cyanocobalamin, alone, or in com-bination with other vitamins and/or active substances (Chen et al., 2010; Perveen et al., 2009; Radhika et al., 2012).Cyanocobalamin is the commercial form of Vitamin B12 and specifications are found in the Codex for usage as food, and in the USP and BP for pharmaceutical use. The official Pharmacopoeia monographs for Vitamin B12 pre-scribe UV-spectrophotometric assay determination, as an analytical procedure for quantification of our analyte of in-terest, at 361 nm.The aim of our work is to propose two different meth-ods for routine analysis of the active compound whether it is consisted in dietary supplement or pharmaceutical dos-age form, as an alternative to each other in quality control laboratories in pharmaceutical/chemical industry.Materials and methodsAll used chemicals were of Ph.Eur. quality and the demineralized water was Stilman produced and had con-ductivity less than 1 \u00b5S. Pottasium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4) and 85% phosphoric acid were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich, USA, whereas acetonitrile was purchased from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Cyanocobala-min working standard, the pharmaceutical dosage forms and dietary supplements were purchased from Replek Farm, Skopje, Macedonia.Spectrophotometric method includes \u201cVARIAN Car-ry Win 50\u201d UV-VIS-spectrophotometer, 1-cm quartz cell at wavelength range 190 - 750 nm, with resolution 0.5 nm and scan rate of 300 nm/min. The HPLC determination was performed on Vari-an Pro Star HPLC system, with autosampler 410, Varian 325 dual-channel and Varian 335 photodiode-array detec-tor, with ternary high pressure mixing pump, controlled by Galaxy software version 1.91. The test and standard solutions for both proposed methods were prepared by dissolving suitable amount of S2 PP 94206Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 205 - 206 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsthe active substance or powdered film-coated tablets in de-mineralized water, as solvent, to concentration of 0.02 mg/ml for spectrophotometric determination and 0.1 mg/ml for HPLC determination.Results and discussionCyanocobalamin is the most stable form of vitamin B12. It has optimum stability at pH range 4.0 - 4.5, and therefore the extraction is usually carried out in this range. Severe alkaline and acid conditions, ultraviolet (UV) or strong visible light, and oxidizing agents inactivate the vi-tamin (Eitenmiller et al., 2007; Hurst, 2002). Cyanocobalamin is water-soluble vitamin, therefore water is a good extraction solvent. In UV and visible spec-trophotometry, aqueous solutions of Cyanocobalamin ex-hibit maximums in UV and visible region at 278 nm, 361 nm, and 550 nm. The spectrophotometric method we pro-pose prescribes signal measurement at wavelength of 550 nm of aqueous solutions with concentration ~0.02 mg/ml. Spectrophotometric method for determination of Cyanoco-balamin has low cost and acceptable specificity in compar-ison with radio ligand assay. However, it is not suitable for complex samples, where the sensitivity is relatively low, so it is not used routinely for determination of Cyanocobala-min in combined pharmaceutical products.According to available literature, Vitamin B12 is a weak base that stays approximately neutral at pH from about 5 to 10. The pKa values reported are 3.3 and 9.3 (Trang, 2013). Since it is preferred to avoid use of mo-bile phase with pH in proximity of the pKa values of an-alytes, if possible up to at least \u00b1 1 pH unit, we chose to use mobile phase containing buffer with pH ~2.5 and or-ganic constituent (acetonitrile) in variable amount, in or-der to achieve optimal retention of the analyte. The opti-mized chromatographic method uses mobile phase consist-ed of 13% v/v acetonitrile and 87% v/v (20 mM KH2PO4, buffer adjusted to pH = 2.5 with 85% phosphoric acid). The tests are performed on a LiChropher RP Select B chro-matographic column (125 x 4 mm with 5 \u00b5m particles), with UV detection at 550 nm. Volume of injection used is 50 \u00b5l, with mobile phase flow rate of 1.5 ml/min.Cyanocobalamin peak elutes with retention time ~5 minutes, with symmetry expressed as AsUSP ~0.9. Almost the same results were obtained when the two developed methods were used in analysis of tablets con-taining Cyanocobalamin. The absolute difference between values for Cyanocobalamin assay obtained using the pro-posed UV-spectrophotometric and HPLC method was in-significant (far lower than 2%), which indicates that both can be used in quality control laboratories for Cyanocobal-amin determination.ConclusionThe two developed methods are suitable for routine analysis of the active compound Cyanocobalamin in di-etary supplements or pharmaceutical dosage forms, and can be used as an alternative to each other in quality con-trol laboratories in pharmaceutical/chemical industry.Both methods are simple, fast, cost-effective, sensi-tive, accurate, reproducible and rugged. We suggest use of the spectrophotometric method as a routine for industri-al application and analysis of Vitamin B12 in more simple matrixes. The chromatographic method is more selective and can be used either in routine analyses or in more com-plex analyses and can be further optimized for purpose of analysis of various multivitamin dosage forms.ReferencesBritish Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2012.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* apetrovska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionThe objective of this study was to develop a new drug product formulation with amino acid as active substance. The direct detection by ultraviolet absorbance of amino ac-ids is possible only at low wavelengths, where sensitivi-ty is poor and interference in background absorption is po-tentially high (Petritis et al., 1999). There are two report-ed spectrophotometric methods with UV detection at 210 nm of this active substance in pharmaceutical preparation (Onal and Sagirli, 2009). Several derivatization methods have been proposed, by using derivatizing reagents such as potassium iodide for spectrophotometric detection (Gu-jral et al., 2009), fluorescamine, 2,4-nitrofluorobenzen and 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinon (Shaalan, 2010) for spectrofluorometric detection. The HPLC methods with precolumn (Vermeij and Edelbroek, 2004) and post col-umn derivatization of this active substance with o-phthal-dialdehyde (Douou et al., 2010) and derivatization with fluorescamine (Martinc et al., 2010) were also reported. All these methods with derivatization and fluorescence de-tection cannot be applied for determination of related and degradation products, because the main degradation prod-uct produced by cyclization between amino and carbox-ylic acid group has lactam ring in the structure, which is a strong chromophore group. The ultraviolet absorption method is suitable for its detection (Dee-Noor et al., 2009).To establish degradation pathways of the active sub-stance, its stability in a combination with excipients in fi-nal formulation mixture and detection of interactions be-tween the drug and excipients, all in order to develop the most stable drug product, forced degradation study was performed by applying different stress conditions (Baerts-chi et al., 2005).Materials and methodsTesting formulation I was consisted of amino acid as active substance and excipients in a ratio of 1:3 (% w/w), respectively, with filler 1, which was excipient without car-bonyl group in the chemical structure.Testing formulation II was consisted of the same filler 1, but active substance and excipients were in a ratio of 3:1 (% w/w), respectively. Testing formulation III was consisted of amino acid as active substance and excipients in a ratio of 1:3 (% w/w), respectively, but with filler 2, which is reducing sugar with carbonyl group in the chemical structure.The following forced degradation study was applied:a) Thermal degradation: the samples were kept in dry-ing oven at 80 \u00b0C for 20 days;b) Thermal/humidity degradation: the opened and cap-sulated samples sprayed in thin layer on Petri of 1:3 (% w/w),ept in pharmaceutical stability chamber at 40 \u00b0C and 75% RH for 90 days;c) Photo degradation: the samples were kept in photo stability chamber under maximum radiation of the xenon lamp (765Wh/m2) for 35 hours;d) Acid hydrolysis: the samples were treated with 0.5M hydrochloric acid at 50 \u00b0C for 2 hours; e) Base hydrolysis: the samples were treated with 0.5M sodium hydroxide at 50 \u00b0C for 2 hours;f) Oxidative degradation: the samples were treated with 1% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide at room temperature for 1 hour.All samples, control and treated, were analyzed by the in-house developed HPLC method for determination of re-lated and degradation products in the drug product.S2 PP 95208Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 207 - 208 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsResults and discussionConsidering all of the reported data for the Maillard reaction between carbonyl group from reducing sugar and amino group (Qiu et al., 2005) the main goal was to find the adequate filler in the development of the drug prod-uct formulation containing amino acid as active substance. The first differences caused by the type of excipient used as filler and the second differences caused by the content of excipients in the formulation, have been fully identified and understood. The active substance was unstable under elevated tem-perature, acid and base hydrolysis. No degradation of ex-cipients was found under all applied stress conditions. It has been observed different modes of degradation accord-ing to the type of formulation mixture. Under thermal deg-radation the main degradation product, lactam, was formed in the same amounts, regardless of the type of filler and the content of the excipients in the formulation. Further, in for-mulation III one unspecified impurity with RRT 2.37 was slightly increased, which is the product of the Maillard re-action between amino acid and reducing sugar used as fill-er 2. Under thermal and humidity degradation, many dif-ferences between the formulations were observed because the samples were treated in two different ways: as opened capsule masses sprayed in thin layer on Petri\u2019s dishes and as capsulated samples. Two degradation pathways, cycliza-tion to lactam and the interaction between amino and car-bonyl group were enhanced due to several factors for in-stance, the higher content of the excipients in terms of the active component, the hygroscopic characteristics of an an-other filler, filler 3, used in amount of 33% w/w and the capsule shell, especially in the formulation I and III.As was expected, the acid hydrolysis causes the reac-tion of cyclization of amino acid to lactam (Dee-Noor et al., 2009), where the most susceptible formulations in our study were formulation I and III. After the base hydrolysis, lactam was increased in greater, but in the same amounts in all samples. Besides lactam, formulation I and III with the higher content of the excipients were shown as much unstable, degraded to a few unspecified impurities, where total impurities of 10.56% and 12.01%, respectively, were obtained.  The ef-fect of photo degradation was insignificant. Under oxida-tion, the content of the active substance in all samples was not decreased. All samples treated with mild oxidative con-ditions, 1% H2O2, room temperature for 1 hour, degrad-ed to several products with higher ultraviolet absorption than active substance, due to the new formed chromophore groups in the structure. ConclusionIn this study, it has been shown that the amino acid as active substance in the presence of reducing sugar used as filler in the drug product formulation undergoes a Maillard reaction over time, especially enhanced by increased tem-perature and humidity. In order to produce the most stable formulation during the manufacturing process and during the proposed shelf-life of the drug product, the proposed filler without carbonyl group in the chemical structure was proved as a suitable excipient, avoiding the drug-excipi-ent interaction, and further, lower content of excipients in terms of the active component in the drug product formu-lation, has been suggested.AcknowledgmentWe are grateful to Prof. Dr. Aneta Dimitrovska from Faculty of Pharmacy, Cyril and Methodius University, for valuable discussion and support of this research.ReferencesBaertschi, S.W., Lilly, E. and Company Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, 2005.

Testing is carried out in the interest of official market surveillance of medicinal prod-ucts in relation to the safety of human patient and/or ani-mals, prior to and/or after marketing of the respective med-icines and is demonstrated to be free from conflicts of in-terest\u201d (Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2001/82/EC, PA/PH/OMCL (07) 89 14R, 2015).The role of the OMCLs is focussed on the independent quality control of medicines and it includes a number of different pre and post-marketing surveillance programmes. These extend to the sampling and testing of branded and ge-neric medicines, unlicensed (unauthorized) medicines, ille-gal medicines (counterfeits / medicines with falsified label-ling), vaccines, blood and plasma-derived medicinal prod-ucts, and active substances. OMCL surveillance work also includes examinations of product packaging and labelling. It supports the evaluation of the quality part of MA files, as well as pharmacovigilance assessments, quality defect in-vestigations, and GMP inspections. In the framework of the European Pharmacopoeia, the work of OMCLs plays a vital part, in relation for example to monograph develop-ment activities, etc. Beside medicines, a number of OM-CLs also perform laboratory testing on cosmetics, medi-cal devices, diagnostics, food, feed (premixes) for veteri-nary use, and other \u201cborderline products\u201d (PA/PH/OMCL (07) 89 14R, 2015).Public and stakeholder awareness of the importance of OMCL workThe public and animal health benefits of having a well-established and resourced system of quality control sur-veillance of medicines placed on the market are numerous - such work helps to independently assure the quality of the medicines on the market, and it results in regulatory ac-tions when sub-standard or illegal medicines are found in the market. However, the benefits of this work are not al-ways apparent to the various stakeholders, especially in re-lation to the routine surveillance day-to-day testing work that is carried out. This lack of awareness can lead to ques-tions among stakeholders about the usefulness of the work of OMCLs, and about the level of resources and funding that OMCLs require.  Furthermore, it may not be evident to the public how a reduction in the funding of an OMCL (or the downsizing of an OMCL) may affect public and animal health protec-tion (PA/PH/OMCL (14) 123 R, 2015).Therefore, a common need for raising the national and wider awareness of the benefits of the OMCL and the GEON was acknowledged.Public relation effortsRecently, GEON began renewed efforts to strength-en its stakeholder-interaction strategies and its communi-cation activities so as to more effectively disseminate in-S2 PP 96210Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 209 - 210 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsformation on the benefits of having a strong OMCL Net-work in place for the independent surveillance of the qual-ity of medicines.Despite some earlier successes of GEON public rela-tion (PR) efforts towards the general public as well as in the relation with supranational bodies (PA/PH/OMCL (14) 123 R, 2015), it was envisaged that a new communications strategy is required for the GEON.  There are various el-ements to this work, including the need to identify what key messages about OMCLs and the GEON need to be made and to what stakeholders. While the general public if of course a very important stakeholder, it is unclear at the present time exactly what PR activities should be directed towards the general public. It may be more beneficial to fo-cus communication strategies on those stakeholders direct-ly involved in regulatory, legal and funding activities.Best communication practicesIf a country is dedicated to strengthening Quality Man-agement (QM) & Quality Control (QC) systems, then each measure for developing the capacity of the national OM-CLs within national strategic programmes should be con-sidered. As the OMCLs are usually part of bigger organiza-tions, special efforts should be made to address the stake-holders that provide the OMCL directly with resources. This can be done by means of presenting data under-pinning the performance of OMCLs e.g. by highlight-ing particularities and/or added values. Each success sto-ry should be released to the public, so higher awareness amongst the concerned stakeholders is achieved.Each opportunity for joint national, bilateral and inter-national projects that facilitate recognition of the impor-tance of OMCLs and involvement in critical issues of the health care system should be utilized.Social network platforms should be populated with in-formation on regular OMCL activities and lessons learned on health hazardous issues, especially those affecting pa-tients directly (i.e. in case when medicine, medical devices or \u2018food supplements\u2019 are purchased from untrusted sourc-es, such as internet or teleshops).The best communication practices from each individu-al OMCL could help developing a common \u2018tool kit\u2019 on in-ternational level, which could in revert help OMCLs to bet-ter reposition themselves within their national competent authorities for the benefits of all. In this context the Euro-pean Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & Health-Care (EDQM), under the auspice of Council of Europe, has a central role in the process of strengthening the role of OMCLs and its Network, as it compiles the best com-munication practices from the GEON, and identifies key points to elaborate European wide strategy. Target partners in this respect would be: Co-ordination Group for Mutu-al Recognition and Decentralised procedures - Human and veterinary (CMDh and CMDv) within Head of the Medi-cine Agencies (HMAs), Committee for Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use (CHMP and CMVP) within European Medicine agency (EMA),etc.PerspectiveThe authors wish to highlight the importance of the work done by OMCLs within the national and international health systems, but also to point out that the role of OMCL is very often underestimated which as a consequence might result in negative impact on the global patient safety in par-ticular regarding the combat against substandard and falsi-fied medicines. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that other types of laboratories with comparable scope of activ-ities are experiencing similar pressure with respect to cost/resource cuttings. The aim of this paper is to motivate each OMCL and other quality control laboratories to consider activities which could help raising public awareness, and in particular the awareness of stakeholders which decide about and provide resources to these laboratories. The im-portance of investments to develop OMCL capacities in or-der to meet new analytical challenges against substandard and falsified medicines must become part of national strat-egies, as it would pronounce a benefit for the health system in a cost/effective way.ReferencesDirective 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, as amended (Article 19; Procedures relevant for marketing authorisation, Articles 111 and 114; Supervision and Sanctions) as amended.Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products, as amended (Article 23; Procedure for marketing authorisation, Articles 80 and 82; Supervision and Sanctions) as amended.PA/PH/OMCL (07) 89 14R, June 2015, GEON Terms of Reference - Annex 1: Definition, Role and Status of OMCLs of the GEON, GEON/EDQM - Council of Europe, Strasbourg.PA/PH/OMCL (14) 123R, March 2015, OMCL Public Relations Best Practices \u2013 Position Paper of the AdG GEON, AdG GEON/EDQM - Council of Europe, Strasbourg.Poster presentationsMacedonian pharmaceutical bulletin, 62 (suppl) 211 - 212 (2016)ISSN 1409 - 8695UDC: 615.015.4:519.87Short communicationMathematical modeling of drug dissolution from prolonged-release drug productBlagica Manchevska*, Packa Antovska, Irena Brashnarska, Sonja UgarkovicResearch and Development Institute, ALKALOID AD,  Blv Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* bmanchevska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionThe process of dissolution is of fundamental impor-tance for the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of drug products. The process of drug release in an aque-ous body fluid includes different physical phenomena as wetting of the particle\u2019s surface, breakdown of solid state bonds, solvation, diffusion as well as convection in the sur-rounding bulk fluid. Drug release rate from modified re-lease drug products can be controlled by diffusion, deg-radation, swelling followed by diffusion and dissolution. Different mathematical models may be used as an instru-mental tool for understanding the drug release form dif-ferent drug delivery systems (Siepmann and Siepmann, 2013). Some of the models were used to explore and ex-plain the release mechanisms of prolonged-release drug product.Materials and methodsDissolution tests of prolonged-release tablets with BCS Class I have been performed, using basket appara-tus at 100 rpm, in 500 mL phosphate buffer with pH 6.8 at 37\u00b10.5 \u00b0C for 24 hours. Dissolution profiles were obtained by sampling 10 mL at 8 time points (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 hours). Quantification of the dissolved drug is performed with HPLC method with UV detection at 242 nm, mobile phase is solution of sodium edetate and acetic acid, meth-anol and acetonitrile (60:20:20 v/v/v), pump flow 2.0 mL/min, column temperature 40 \u00b0C and injection volume 100 \u03bcL. Mathematical modeling of the dissolution data was performed with DDSolver (Zhang et al., 2010). Three for-mulations with different rate-controlling excipients were evaluated. A number of mathematical models have been assessed for evaluation of drug release data: zero order, first-order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas, Hixon-Crowell, Hopfenberg, Peppas-Sahlin, Weibull and Gompertz.Results and discussionThe average values (in percentage) of the dissolu-tion profile of formulation 1 are: 7.78, 14.69, 26.87, 38.02, 48.22, 56.82, 64.87 and 97.71, formulation 2: 4.55, 8.71, 17.5, 27.88, 38.23, 50.64, 60.69 and 93.9 and formulation 3: 4.36, 8.84, 18.46, 26.94, 35.55, 45.12, 54.38 and 88.85.Concerning the model selection criteria, DDSolver provides a number of statistical criteria for evaluating the goodness of fit of a model, among which the most popular are adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adjusted), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Model Selection Criteri-on (MSC) (Zhang et al., 2010).The Adjusted Coefficient of Determination is an ad-justment for the Coefficient of Determination that takes into account the number of variables in a data set.AIC is a measure of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, rel-ative to each of the other models. When comparing mod-els with different numbers of parameters, the model with a lower AIC value can be considered to be the better model.MSC is a modified reciprocal form of the AIC and is independent of the scaling of the data points. When com-paring different models, the most appropriate model will be that with the largest MSC.Zero order kinetics describes the systems where the drug release rate is independent of its concentration and can be used to describe the dissolution of several types of modified release dosage forms and dissolution from dos-age forms that do not disaggregate and release the drug S2 PP 97212Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 211 - 212 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsslowly (assuming that area does not change and no equi-librium conditions are obtained) (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.91-0.98, AIC 46.85-61.05 and MSC 1.95-3.40.Dosage forms that follow first order dissolution pro-file, such as those containing water-soluble drugs in porous matrices, release the drug in a way that is proportional to the amount of drug remaining in its interior, in such way, that the amount of drug released by unit of time diminish-es (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.96-0.98, AIC 45.29-53.53 and MSC 2.82-3.70.Higuchi describes drug release as a diffusion process based in the Fick\u2019s law, square root time dependent and can describe drug dissolution from several types of mod-ified release dosage forms, such as some transdermal sys-tems and matrix tablets with water soluble drugs (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.87-0.94, AIC 56.84-63.97 and MSC 1.66-2.41.Korsmeyer-Peppas is exponential equation often used to describe the drug release from polymeric systems, when the release mechanism is not well known or when more than one type of release phenomena could be involved (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). The n-value from the Kors-meyer-Peppas model indicates (0.70-0.85) anomalous dif-fusion or nonfickian diffusion which refers to combination of both diffusion and erosion controlled rate release (Pep-pas 1985). R2adjusted is 0.98-0.99, AIC 35.76-46.04 and MSC 3.65-4.63.Hixon-Crowell model describes the release from sys-tems with a change in surface area and diameter of parti-cles or tablets. When this model is used, it is assumed that the release rate is limited by the drug particles dissolution rate and not by the diffusion that might occur through the polymeric matrix (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.98-1.00, AIC 28.81-46.03 and MSC 3.66-5.53.The release of drugs from surface-eroding devices with several geometries was analyzed by Hopfenberg who de-veloped a general mathematical equation describing drug release from slabs, spheres and infinite cylinders display-ing heterogeneous erosion (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.99-1.00, AIC 19.69-37.60 and MSC 4.59-6.54.Peppas-Sahlin model (Zhang et al., 2010) demon-strates the following goodness of fit: R2adjusted 0.99-1.00, AIC 26.09-42.81 and MSC 4.01-5.83.Weibull model demonstrates the following goodness of fit: R2adjusted around 1.00, AIC -8.91 to 21.67 and MSC 6.36-9.72. This is an empiric model, not deducted from any kinetic fundament, therefore, could only describe, but does not adequately characterize, the dissolution kinetic proper-ties of the drug. This model is useful for characterization of release profiles of matrix type drug delivery (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001).The Gompertz model (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001) is suitable for characterization of release profiles of drugs having good solubility and intermediate release rates. R2ad-justed is 0.99-1.00, AIC 16.83-37.30 and MSC 4.63-6.86.ConclusionMathematical models are generally designed to devel-op new drug delivery systems based on the release charac-teristics, to predict the effect of design parameters on the resulting drug release rate, to optimize the release kinetics, to elucidate the underlying mass transport mechanisms, to accurately predict the drug release profile and improve the overall therapeutic efficacy and safety of these drugs.The mathematical models with better goodness of fit are Weibull, Gompertz, Hopfenberg, Peppas-Sahlin, Hix-on-Crowell and Korsmeyer-Peppas and they characterize the dissolution kinetic and help to better understand the underlying drug release mechanisms. Also the amount of drug release percent by each mechanism at each time can be also calculated.The drug release profiles from all formulations can be best expressed by Weibull\u2019s equation, as the plots showed highest goodness of fit. This is an empiric model that can describe the dissolution kinetic properties.The results from the mathematical modeling indicate that more than one type of release phenomena is involved. Hopfenberg model indicates that erosion is one of the re-lease mechanisms. Korsmeyer-Peppas model indicates that there is combination of both diffusion and erosion con-trolled rate release. Hixon-Crowell model includes disso-lution as one of the release mechanisms. When the pro-longed-release tablets come in contact with the dissolution medium, they take up water and swell, forming a gel lay-er around the matrix and simultaneously erosion occurs.ReferencesCosta, P., Sousa Lobo, J.M., 2001.

Exemestane is 6-methylenandrosta-1,4-di-ene-3,17-dione a newer steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It is an enzyme activated irreversible inhibitor of aromatase. It is orally available and highly selective for aromatase. Its structure reflects only minor structural modifications to the natural substrate, androstenedione. Plasma estrogen levels are reduced by 85% to 95% within 2 to 3 days, and ef-fects last 4 to 5 days. Exemestane does not inhibit any of the major cytochromes P450 and has essentially no interac-tion with steroid receptors, with only a very weak affinity for the AR. The 17-hydroxyexemestane reduction product, however, has much higher affinity for the AR than the par-ent (still several fold less than DHT, 0.28% for parent vs. 30% for metabolite). The clinical significance of the affini-ty is likely minimal because of the low levels of the metab-olite produced (Pagani et al., 2014).Literature survey reports that Exemestane can be de-termined by different analytical techniques such as HPTLC (Mane et al., 2010), UV-spectrophotometry (Angala-parameswari et al., 2012), GC-MS (de Albuquerque Cav-alcanti et al., 2011), LC-MS (Allievi et al., 1995), HPLC (Konda et al., 2011; Ksycinska et al., 2011) and UPLC (Reddy et al., 2011)  in pharmaceutical dosage forms. In these described methods C18 (modified silica gel with a hydrocarbon chain of 18 carbon atoms) stationary phas-es were used. In our work C12 stationary phase was used. Using C12 stationary phase we have developed a method for the quantification of exemestan and its impurities in the tablets. The developed method was validated as per ICH guidelines with respect to specificity, linearity, LOD, LOQ, accuracy, precision and robustness.Materials and methodsThe experiments were performed on the chromato-graphic system Agilent HP1200 with DAD detector. The analytical columns used in this study were in examining of chromatographic conditions were used: reference standards exemestane, impurities B and C, the chromatographic col-umn Synergi 4\u00b5m MAX-RP 80A 150 x 4.60 mm (C12). The optimum conditions for separation and determination of exemestane and its impurities were achieved with the mobile phase: water /acetonitrile in the ratio 50/50 (v/v), at a flow rate of 1.2 mL / min and the column temperature was maintained at 30 \u00b0C. Stocks of standard solutions were pre-pared in the methanol and storage in the fridge. To evalu-ate the linearity of the developed method, five solutions of exemestan and its impurities were prepared in the concen-tration range from the 50 \u03bcg/mL to 150 \u03bcg/mL, 0.49 \u03bcg/mL to 49 \u03bcg/mL and 0.54 \u03bcg/mL to 54 \u03bcg/mL for exemestan, imp. B and imp. C. The accuracy of the method was con-firmed by preparing three series of solutions containing ap-propriate placebo, exemestan and impurities in three levels: low level 80%, medium level 100% and high level 120%. To prove the precision of the method, three different solu-S2 PP 98214Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 213 - 214 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationstions of exemestan and impurities were prepared. The val-ues for LOD and LOQ were obtained by calculating the sig-nal / noise ratio. Sample solution was prepared in the mo-bile phase in the final concentration 75 \u03bcg/mL.Results and discussionThe proposed method was validated as per ICH guide-line. The system suitability was evaluated on the basis of res-olution between exemestan and impurities (Rs >1.5). In the specificity study chromatograms of placebo had shown no peaks at the retention time of exemestan and impurities. The precision of method was verified by repeatability and inter-mediate precision at three concentrations levels (1-3 \u03bcg/mL for impurities B and C, 80-120 \u03bcg/mL for exemestan). The RSD (%) of results for exemestan and impurities were calcu-lated (RSD for exemestan is 0.06% to 1.41%, for impurity B 0.41% to 1.41% and impurity C 0.56% to 1.52% RSD < 2%). The intermediate precision of the method was also evaluated using different analyst and different instrument and perform-ing the analysis on different days (RSD < 3% for both im-purities and exemestan). The LOD and LOQ for impurities were determined at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1 and 10:1, respectively, by injecting a series of diluted solutions with known concentrations (LOD is 0,049 \u03bcg/mL and LOQ 0,12 \u03bcg/mL for both impurities). The method was linear over the range of concentrations: for impurities B 0.49 \u03bcg /ml to 4.90 \u03bcg /ml (r =0.999), impurity C of 0.54 \u03bcg /ml to 5.40 \u03bcg / ml (r = 0.999) and for exemestane 50.90 \u03bcg /mL to 152.70 \u03bcg /mL (r =0.999) In the based on the obtained results, the iden-tification and quantification of impurities in the investigated exemestane tablets examined the impurities C is present in quantities of less than 0.10%, while the amount of B < LOQ. On the basis of validated methods to determine the content of exemestane in the exemestane tablets of 95.68%.ConclusionIt can be concluded that the defined RP-HPLC method is rapid and efficient for purity testing of exemestane in the raw material and pharmaceuticals dosage forms.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* mpetrovska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionThe rate and extent in which the amount of drug sub-stance dissolves over a period of time is called dissolution. Dissolution testing has emerged in the pharmaceutical field as a very important tool to characterize drug product per-formance. Dissolution test is required to study the drug re-lease from the dosage form and its in vivo performance. Dissolution test is used to assess the lot to lot quality of drug product. Before selecting the proper dissolution me-dium should be determined physical and chemical charac-teristics of the active substance (Ph. Eur., 2015). Dissolu-tion test procedures can be a challenging process, on mul-tiple fronts. The aim of the study was to develop a dissolu-tion test for the quality control for new generic immediate-release drug product with one active substance. Sink con-ditions, drug solubility in different dissolution media, dif-ferent filter type, different volume of the dissolution medi-um and different apparatus were tested. Materials and methodsThe dissolution procedure has several distinct compo-nents. These components include a dissolution medium, an apparatus, the study design (including acceptance criteria) and the mode of assay. All of these components must be properly chosen and developed to provide a method that is reproducible for within laboratory day-to-day operation and robust enough to enable transfer to another laboratory.Selection of dissolution medium When selecting the dissolution medium, physical and chemical data for the drug substance and drug product need to be considered, e.g. the solubility and solution state stability of the drug as a function of pH value. The solubil-ity of the active substance is pH dependent and the increase of pH would enhance its solubility and consequently the dissolution rate, particularly at pH > pKa of the compound.Sink conditions have been determined by in house method. Generally, when developing dissolution method, one of the goals is to obtain sink conditions. According to the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur., 2015), \u201csink con-ditions\u201d normally occur in a volume of dissolution medium that is at least 3 to 10 times the saturation volume, there-fore sink conditions are maintained throughout the dura-tion of the test film-coated tablets in the specified medium, phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. The dissolution media temper-ature is fixed i. e. 37.0 (\u00b10.5) \u00b0C (Ph. Eur., 2015). Media deaeration is usually required, and can be ac-complished by heating the medium or (more commonly) filtering the medium or placing it under vacuum for short period of time. Bubbles can cause particles to cling to the apparatus and vessel walls. On the other hand, bubbles on the dosage units may increase buoyancy, leading to an in-crease in the dissolution rate, or may decrease the avail-able surface area, leading to a decrease in the dissolution rate (USP, 2015). Selection of dissolution apparatus/ agitation The choice of apparatus is based on the dosage form performance in the in vitro test system. For solid oral dos-age forms, Apparatus 1 and Apparatus 2 are used most fre-quently. For immediate-release and capsule (both soft gel and hard gel) formulation , USP-I i.e. basket apparatus  at 100 rpm or USP-II i.e. paddle apparatus  at 50 or 75 rpm are recommended. Coning in dosage form can be reduced by increasing the paddle speed, thus reducing the artifact and improving the data (USP, 2015).Apparatus II (paddle) rotating at 75 rpm was selected as most appropriate. Different paddle speeds (50 rpm and 75 rpm) and different Apparatus (Apparatus 1 and Appara-S2 PP 99216Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 215 - 216 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationstus 2) were tested. On 50 rpm conning was noticed which leads to incomplete release of active ingredient from tab-lets and higher variability in dissolution rates. Results and discussionDissolution is evaluated by measuring rate release pro-file or the amount dissolved over time. For immediate-re-lease dosage forms, dissolution time from 30 min to 60 min is recommended (British Pharmacopoeia, 2015). In our ex-perimental case multiple time points were performed for establishing the dissolution time. Observations are espe-cially useful during method development and optimiza-tion. USP chapter <1092>contains additional information on observations (USP, 2015). Sampling probe can affect the hydrodynamics of the system and so that can change the dissolution rate. Regard-ing the position of sampling, the probe should be sampled at approximately half the distance from the basket or pad-dle to the dissolution medium and not closer than 1 cm to the side of the flask. Adsorption of the active substance onto filter needs to be evaluated. Filter material must be saturated with the active substance by repeated passage to avoid losses that might go undetected during the test sam-pling. Accumulation of the particulate matter on the sur-face may cause significant error in the dissolution testing. Sample solutions were prepared in proposed dissolu-tion medium. The sample solutions were prepared using film-coated tablets into 900 mL dissolution medium at 37.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C and with at 75 rpm for 45 minutes.  Different al-iquots (0.3 and 6 mL) were filtered using different filter types (0.45-\u00b5m), diluted suitably and analyzed spectropho-tometrically. A filter type is found to be acceptable for use if the results of the filtered portions are within 98-102% of the original concentrations of the unfiltered standard solu-tion and the centrifuged sample solution. Acceptance criteria must also be considered during test development. Acceptance criteria are derived in the form of \u201cQ-factors\u201d a minimum amount dissolved at a giv-en time as a percentage of the labeled content (ICH, 1999). Assaying the resultsThere are two common ways of analyzing dissolution test samples, spectrophotometric (UV) determinations and HPLC. The selection of the optimal wavelength for analy-sis was based on the wavelength of maximum absorption in the UV spectrum of the active substance. Cells with path lengths ranging from 0.02 to 1 cm were used. Optimization of Dissolution TestThe dissolution experiments were conducted in a six-station bath dissolution apparatus by subjecting six imme-diate-release  tablets to 900 mL of proposed dissolution medium, paddle dissolution apparatus, and stirring speeds of  75 rpm. The temperature was maintained at 37 \u00b10.5 \u00b0C. Aliquots of 10 mL were withdrawn manually at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 min, and replaced by the same volume of the medium heated at 37 \u00b10.5 \u00b0C. The sample was filtered using regenerated cellulose (RC), 0.45-\u00b5m filter and ana-lyzed spectrophotometrically at 221 nm. Acceptance crite-ria for not less than 85% (Q+5%) of the labeled content for 45 min was set.Discriminatory properties of the dissolution methodFinally, the dissolution test procedure should be dis-criminating enough to be capable of distinguishing signif-icant changes in a composition or manufacturing process that might be expected to affect in vivo performance. In general, a properly designed dissolution test should result in reproducible data.The proposed dissolution methodology has shown to be suitable for quality control of tablets manufactured us-ing the commercial process and is capable of discriminat-ing changes in the critical manufacturing process steps and formulation composition. To elucidate the discriminatory power of the dissolution method, a formulation contain-ing different quantity of the active ingredient than the fi-nal tested product, was analyzed using the proposed disso-lution method and the dissolution profiles of both formula-tions were compared. ConclusionThe obtained results indicate that pH 7.2 as a dissolu-tion medium of choice, together with the selected dissolu-tion method parameters, are reflective of the product char-acteristics and are able to distinguish differences in formu-lation of the product.ReferencesBritish Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2015.

Aleksandar Makedonski br. 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* oblazeska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionDuring extraction and synthesis of pholcodine mono-hydrate, organic solvents are used. For that purpose a HS-GC-FID method for determination of ethanol, methanol, toluene and benzene in pholcodine monohydrate has been developed and validated. Even though benzene is not used during any of the manufacturing stages, it is a regulato-ry requirement to monitor for its eventual presence in the product, since benzene is a known degradation product of toluene. Furthermore, benzene is the most toxic among these solvents (Class 1) and it is recommended to be avoid-ed in the production of drug substances, in accordance to ICH Q3C (R5) (ICH, 2011). Methanol and toluene show severe toxicity (Class 2), hence their usage should be limit-ed, and ethanol is the least toxic of them (Class 3) (Ph.Eur., 2014). As residual solvents are highly volatile compounds, HS-GC-FID is the most convenient technique for their de-termination and quantitation (Ph.Eur., 2014). This study describes the development and validation of method for routine analysis of four residual solvents (ethanol, methanol, toluene and benzene) in pholcodine monohydrate drug substance.Materials and methodsEthanol, methanol, N,N-dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) - GC grade were ob-tained from Merck Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany), tolu-ene and benzene-from Sigma Aldrich (Sent Louis, USA) and pholcodine monohydrate API was obtained from Al-kaloid AD Skopje, Macedonia. The method was developed, optimized and validated on a Shimadzu 2010 Plus gas chromatograph, equipped with FID detector and PAL AOC-5000 autosampler for headspace and liquid samples (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), with helium as a carrier gas in the split mode. The separation of the components was performed using Agilent DB-624 (30 m x 0.53 mm x 3 \u00b5m) WCOT capillary column.Results and discussionA standard stock solution in N,N-Dimethylformamide containing the investigated residual solvents in API phol-codine monohydrate was prepared in such a way that the final concentrations of the solvents were approximately 2500 ppm for ethanol, 1500 ppm for methanol, 440 ppm for toluene and 1 ppm for benzene (concentration level 100%). The sample solution was prepared by weighing ap-proximately 500 mg of pholcodine monohydrate in a 20 ml headspace vial, followed by addition of 1 mL N,N-Dimeth-ylformamide as diluent.Chromatographic method development started with ini-tial gradient conditions: 0 to 10 minutes isocratic segment at 45 \u00b0C, then linear temperature gradient of 10 \u00b0C/min to 220 \u00b0C and finally and isocratic segment at 220 \u00b0C for 2.5 minutes, for total chromatographic runtime of 30 minutes. These conditions provided complete separation of the four tested solvents and the diluent, with adequate column per-formance and good peak shape for all analytes, howev-S2 PP 100218Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 217 - 218 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationser with unnecessarily long run time. Judging by this con-clusion, chromatographic conditions was performed by in-creasing the initial column temperature to 50 \u00b0C, shortening the initial isocratic segment to 3 minutes and selecting more aggressive temperature gradient of 20 \u00b0C/min.The method was validated within the ICH guidelines. Parameters included in the validation procedure were: specificity, linearity and range, accuracy, repeatability and intermediate precision, limit of detection, limit of quantita-tion and robustness. In order to determine the specificity of the optimized method, a blank solution (DMF), sample solution and in-dividual standard solutions of the investigated residual sol-vents, as well as their mixture, were injected onto the GC column. DB-624 column (30 m length x 0.53 mm i.d. x 3 \u00b5m film thickness) provided sufficient baseline separation of all residual solvents, including the diluent, fulfilling the criterion for the resolution between ethanol and methanol peaks being not less than 4. The retention time for residual solvents individually and in spiked standard solution was determined. There was no co-elution between the observ-able peaks.Linearity evaluation was prepared by quantitative di-lutions of the stock solutions of ethanol, methanol and tol-uene in order to obtain solutions in the range from quantifi-cation limit to 150% of working concentration (Lokhannde et al., 2012). The average value for the area under the peak obtained from the three injections for each solvent was plotted against the corresponding concentration in ppm, hence calibration curves were obtained. The correlation coefficients were above 0.990. The accuracy of the analytical method was confirmed by evaluation of the recovery. The recovery test was car-ried out at three concentration levels: 50%, 100% and 150% of the limits for each residual solvent. The percent-age recovery ranges was from 82.12% to 104.41%.Repeatability of the system as a validation parame-ter was evaluated on the basis of the results for the rela-tive standard deviation from six successive injections. The RSD for at least of six injections was not more than 15% according to Ph.Eur. (Jahnavi and Saravanan, 2012). To evaluate the intermediate precision, six sample so-lutions were prepared individually using single batch of pholcodine monohydrate drug substance as per test meth-od, and were applied in two consecutive days according to the same procedure. The difference between the results ob-tained in two different days was less than 20%, so accep-tance criteria was fulfilled and the method was confirmed being precise.The limit of detection and limit of quantification were found to be specific for each solvent.Robustness was tested by introducing small variations in the method parameters: carrier gas flow (\u00b1 0.1 ml/min), injector temperature (\u00b1 5 \u00b0C) and detector temperature (\u00b1 5 \u00b0C). For each set of variation, six replicate injections of the standard solution with concentration level of 100% were performed. The obtained results for all variations in-dicated that studied variations of GC-HS conditions will not cause any significant changes in system suitability and the method robustness was confirmed.ConclusionDuring the validation procedure, carried out accord-ing to ICH guidelines, highly selective HS-GC-FID meth-od was developed and validated for the identification and quantification of residual solvents present in pholcodine monohydrate API through an understanding of the synthet-ic process, nature of solvents and nature of stationary phas-es of columns. The residual solvents, ethanol, methanol, toluene and benzene were determined and quantified. The developed method was found to be: specific, accurate, pre-cise and robust as per ICH guidelines, hence can be used for routine quality control of residual solvents in pholco-dine monohydrate API.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* ekazandzievska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionIbuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce fever and treat mild to moderate pain or inflammation caused by minor injury, menstrual cramps, toothache, back pain, arthritis or headache. There is a great interest to develop non-oral dosage forms of ibu-profen to reduce its common side effects which are related to gastric disorders. Using topical gel means that the total amount of ibuprofen in the body remains low; this in turn means reducing the mentioned side effects.In general excipients are known to facilitate the ad-ministration and release of active component as well as to protect and stabilize formulation from the environment. However, excipients can also give rise to inadvertent or unintended effects such as increased degradations of the drug. Knowledge of the chemistry of the active substance and excipients can often minimize formulation surprises (Bharate et al., 2010). Assessment of possible interactions (incompatibility) between the active substance (i.e. ibupro-fen) and different excipients along with the evaluation of thermal stability are crucial parts of a normal study prior to the formulation of a medicine (Lira et al., 2007).Excipients used for formulating gel for topical use often consist of gelling agents (cellulose derivates; car-bomers; poloxamers), solvents in which the active ingredi-ent is dispersed or solubilized (water, alchohol), pH stabi-lizers which neutralize polymers as a means of gel forma-tion (organic amines, NaOH), penetration enhancers and cooling agents (menthol).The aim of this study was to evaluate binary/terna-ry mixtures prepared between ibuprofen and some of the most used excipients for gel topical formulations and pre-dict possible interactions by evaluating the related and deg-radation products of ibuprofen using HPLC stability indi-cating method, when exposed to different stress conditions for a predetermined period of time. Materials and methodsMaterialsActive pharmaceutical ingredient (API) ibuprofen used for preparation of the mixtures was of pharmaco-poeial quality (with Certificate of Suitability to the mono-graphs of the European Pharmacopoeia, CEP). European Pharmacopoeia Chemical Reference standard ibuprofen impurity BCRS was used. Excipients used for preparation of the binary/ternary mixtures are all pharmacopeial grade. All other chemicals used in this study were obtained com-mercially as HPLC or analytical grade reagents.Preparation of binary and ternary mixtures Binary and ternary mixtures were prepared by mix-ing equal masses of ibuprofen and the excipient (1:1 and 1:1:1), except Propylene glycol (1:2). Diisopropylamine was pre-hated at temperature of 40-45 \u00b0C. Due to aggre-gate form of the excipients, some mixtures were liquids, solid state and slurry mixtures.One of the approaches to investigate drug-excipient in-teraction is using drug and excipients under thermal meth-ods of analyses (Patel et al., 2015). All binary/ternary mix-tures and pure API, were stored under stress conditions, ex-amining the effect of temperature and humidity at different conditions (25 \u00b0C/60% RH and 40 \u00b0C/75% RH) for 14 days.S2 PP 101220Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 219 - 220 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsMethodsEvaluation of related and degradation products of ibu-profen in binary/ternary mixtures, was performed using validated HPLC method. The equipment consisted of Agi-lent 1260 binary pump, 1260 diode array detector, and de-tection wavelength on 214 nm. Samples were analyzed on Zorbax Extend C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm column ID, 5\u00b5m particle size). The mobile phase consisted a mixture of 1ml o-H3PO4 85% in 2L water and acetonitrile (64:36, v/v) and run through HPLC system at a flow rate of 2 ml/min at room temperature.Results and discussionThe HPLC method used in this study was selective since no other peaks due to excipients appear on the reten-tion time of ibuprofen. The limit of detection and quanti-fication were found to be 0.12 \u00b5g /ml and 0.40 \u00b5g/ml, re-spectively. Related substances present as impurities in ibuprofen can originate from the synthesis and from degradation. Ac-cording to Ph. Eur. (04/2008:0721) specified impurities in ibuprofen API are ibuprofen impurity A, impurity J and impurity N. All other impurities are limited as other/un-specified impurities. The results obtained from the HPLC analyses revealed that pure drug ibuprofen and the mixtures with Carbopol 940 and levomenthol, were stable during 14 days under both storage conditions since no significant change in the degradation profile were noted. There were no other peaks related to degradation products of drug or excipients.  Binary mixture of ibuprofen and propylene glycol re-vealed significant increase of unknown impurities (RRT 1.57; RRT 1.67; RRT 1.74) at 40 \u00b0C/75% RH. This may be expected having in mind the chemical properties of pro-pylene glycol as oxidative reagent which is easily degrad-ed under presence of high temperature, acidic or basic con-taminants and the extreme mass ratio (1:2) between ibu-profen and propylene glycol.  Regarding the corresponding binary mixtures, the ter-nary mixture, composed of ibuprofen, diisopropylamine and Carbopol 940 shows different degradation profile. While 25 \u00b0C/60% RH for 14 days did not reveal signifi-cant change in the degradation profile, 40 \u00b0C/75% RH re-vealed rise of unknown impurities (RRT 0.11 and RRT 0.12) which are not noted as degradation products in the binary mixtures. As for RRT 0.38 which occurs in signifi-cant amount in the binary mixture with diisopropylamine (40 \u00b0C/75% RH), in the ternary mixture it is reduced for 60% on 40 \u00b0C/75% RH, and not detected on 25 \u00b0C/60% RH, for the same period of time. It is well known that the chemical compatibility of an API in a binary mixture may differ from that of a multi-component prototype formulation. Although the degrada-tion is evident at elevated temperature or at unrealistical-ly high concentration ratio of excipient to API, they may not be seen at ambient (real) temperature or at excipient to API ratio for the duration of the product shelf-life (Bharate et al., 2010). However such information can be very help-ful in analyzing any instability issues with commercial for-mulations or during the development of new formulations. ConclusionTraditionally, excipients have been regarded as inert. In this study, excipients which were commonly used for gel topical formulation of ibuprofen were evaluated for inter-actions possibility by estimating the degradation profile of ibuprofen in the mixtures under stress conditions.No significant change of known impurities was ob-served during 14 days stress conditions in all samples.  Bi-nary mixtures with organic amines (triethanolamine and diisopropylamine) and propylene glycol, reveled signifi-cant increase of unknown impurities on accelerated condi-tions of 40 \u00b0C/75% RH. However the behavior of ternary mixture, composed of ibuprofen, Carbopol 940 and DIPA is completely different then the binary mixtures (mild ris-ing of unknown impurities which are not noted in the bina-ry samples and extreme reducing of the significantly raised unknown impurities).ReferencesBharate, S.S., Bharate, B.S., Bajaj, N.A., 2010.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* tachkoska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionAnalytical method development can be a time-con-suming process that can last a long time. Methods are com-monly developed using the traditional approach called \u201cone-factor-at-a-time\u201d (OFAT) which is carried out by se-lecting one instrument parameter to study while holding all other parameters constant. The best performing level of the study parameter is identified by visual inspection of the tri-al chromatograms. The parameter is then constant at this level, and a new instrument parameter is selected for the next trial. The OFAT process is repeated parameter by pa-rameter until an adequately performing instrument method is obtained (Krull et al., 2008). This type of development may create an adequate method but provides a limited un-derstanding of method capabilities and method robustness.Another, systematic screening approach that evaluates a number of stationary phases, pH ranges and organic mod-ifiers provides a more thorough approach to method devel-opment. A Quality by Design (QbD) approach to method development uses statistical design of experiments (DoE) to develop a robust method \u2018design space\u2019. The design space defines the experimental region in which changes to method parameters will not significantly affect the results (ICH, 2009; Lukulay et al., 2009). This approach builds-in robustness to the method as the method is being developed. A better understanding of the overall method capabilities and limitations in development ensures a greater chance of successful method validation, transfer and routine use (Heyden, 2006). Method development using software af-fords considerable time savings for the analyst and the use of quality by design can produce a significantly more ro-bust and quality submission to regulatory authorities.In this study, a quality by design approach using meth-od development software for determination of assay of drug products is presented. Materials and methodsThe study was carried out on an Agilent 1290 infini-ty system equipped with a 6-position column manager and solvent selection valve to allow for automated exploration of a wide range of conditions. Fusion AE Method Develop-ment software was used in conjunction with Chemstation to facilitate a more comprehensive QbD approach meth-od development. For the first phase of initial screening 6 different columns were used: Sun fire C8, 150 x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m; Halo Phenyl-Hexyl 150 x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m; Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18 150 x 4.6 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m; Zorbax SB AQ 150 x 4.6 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m; X Select CSH Fluoro-Phenyl 150 x 4.6 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m and X Select HSS C18 100 x 4.6 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m. Organic modifiers acetonitrile and methanol were varied from 5 to 30 percent. The buffer solution which in-cluded a 5 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohy-drate and a 10 mM 1-pentasulphonic acid sodium salt  was varied in pH range from 3.0-8.0. The column temperature (25 \u00b0C), flow rate (1 mL/min), injection volume (20 \u00b5L) and wavelength (233 nm) were maintained constant. The samples were prepared by spiking placebo, active sub-stance and all known impurities of the active substance in a concentration of 1.0 percent of the concentration of the active substance. The samples were diluted with the buffer solution with pH value depending on the pH value of the mobile phase of the experiments in order to avoid eventual peak distortion or other chromatography problems caused by differences in sample solvent and mobile phase. S2 PP 102222Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 221 - 222 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsResults and discussionAfter defining the variables of interest and the region of variation, an experimental design was generated within Fusion AE. A partial factorial statistical design was select-ed by the software to obtain the maximum amount of infor-mation with the least number of experimental runs (Hey-den and Dejaegher, 2007). The experimental design was then transmitted to Chemstation software where all meth-ods were automatically generated and ready to run. After the end of all the experiments the chromatograms were in-tegrated and the results were imported back into Fusion AE which was used to model the data and to generate an initial method for subsequent optimization. The critical quality attributes (CQA), like retention time (3-8 min), Max Peak-Resolution (>1.5) and USP peak tailing (0.9-2.0) were es-tablished and the software carried out some possible solu-tions.The contour plots of the modeled data show the un-shaded (white) region as the acceptable region where all the critical quality attributes (CQA) are within the above designated criteria. By choosing the contour plot for each column, the type of organic modifier and changing the fac-tors on each axis, the software gives predictions how the critical attributes are changing as a function of the factors on x and y axis. With the usage of the point prediction tool the most optimal method conditions which were located in the unshaded region of the contour plot were selected. These conditions were then exported to chromatography data system and additional experiments were performed. The best chromatography and the \u201cwidest\u201d unshaded re-gion was obtained with column Sun Fire C8 150 x 4.6mm with particle size of 5 \u00b5m with acetonitrile as organic mod-ifier. The optimal percent of the organic modifier was 5 percent and the pH value of the buffer was 3.0. The DoE contour plot helped to determine the settings for the next phase of the development of the method when the concentration of buffer solution was tested. For this purpose a 20 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohy-drate and a 5 mM 1-pentasulphonic acid sodium salt buffer with pH value of 3.0 was used and analyzed with the above specified chromatographic conditions. It can be seen that with a higher concentration of sodium dihydrogen phos-phate monohydrate and lower concentration of 1-penta-sulphonic acid sodium salt a better resolution between the peak of the active substance and the nearby eluting impu-rity is observed. ConclusionChromatographic analytical method development nor-mally begins with selection of the analytical column, the pH of the mobile phase and the organic solvent type. When using the OFAT approach in the initial phase of develop-ment, there is a possibility that this approach will provide limited coverage of the design space and there will be no understanding about the interaction effects between the in-strument parameters. On the other hand a quality by de-sign approach employs a statistically designed experiment to address the design space comprehensively and enables all important variable effects to be understood.The initial column-solvent screening experiment car-ried out by using the quality by design approach and soft-ware capabilities can identify the correct analytical col-umn, pH, and organic solvent type to use in the next phase of method development. The chromatographic conditions for the determination of the assay of drug substance set in this phase of the method development were: column Sun Fire C8 150 x 4.6 mm with particle size of 5 \u00b5m; mobile phase (buffer 20 mM sodium dihydrogen phosphate mono-hydrate and a 5 mM 1-pentasulphonic acid sodium salt buffer with pH value of 3.0  with acetonitrile in ratio of 95 : 5 percent); flow rate (1.0 mL/min); column tempera-ture (T=25 \u00b0C), injection volume (20 \u00b5L) and wavelength (\u03bb=233 nm). The automated method development approach using Fusion AE software provides a better performing and more robust method in less time compared to manual method de-velopment.

There are three techniques for this test: the gel-clot technique, which is based on gel formation; the turbidimetric technique, based on the development of turbidity after cleavage of an endog-enous substrate; and the chromogenic technique, based on the development of color after cleavage of a synthetic pep-tide-chromogen complex (Ph.Eur., 2014).Material and methodsThe testing was performed in accordance with Ph.Eur 8.0/2.6.14 by using Method A. Gel-Clot method: limit test and Method B. Gel-Clot method: quantitative test where permissible endotoxin limit concentration (ELC) in phar-maceutical preparation containing somatropine is < 5IU/mg. The maximum valid dilution (MVD) is 1:400. One In-ternational Unit (IU) of endotoxin is equal to one Endotox-in Unit (EU). The following  reagents, equipment and inventory were used in the test: Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL), Reagent, \u03bb = 0,125 EU/ml from Charles River Endosafe, USA; En-dotoxin control standard, E.coli 055:B5 from Charles Riv-er Endosafe, USA; LAL water from Charles River Endo-safe, USA; Thermoblock for incubation (37 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C) from Lab-Line Instruments, USA; Vortex mixer from Barnstead, USA; Micropipettor from 5-50 ml; 50-200 ml and 200-1000 ml from Socorex, Switzerland; sterile and apyrogen exten-sions for multipipettors from Socorex, Switzerland; ster-ile and apyrogen glass test tubes from Charles River Endo-safe, USA; sterile and apyrogen glass test tubes for dilution from Charles River Endosafe, USA and universal indicator paper pH 0-14 from Sigma-Aldrich.Method ADiluting used for preparation testing, which is not higher than MVD is 1:300.The following test solutions were prepared:Solution A: Diluted test solution being diluted less than MVD (1:300).Solution B: Calibration curve of the endotoxin control standard (CSE) and diluted test solution (1:300) - concen-trations equivalent to 2\u03bb, \u03bb, \u03bb/2 and \u03bb/4 (test for interfer-ing factors).Solution C: Calibration curve of the control endotoxin standard (CSE) and LAL water-concentrations equivalent to 2\u03bb, \u03bb, \u03bb/2 and \u03bb/4 (Confirmation test for the declared ly-sate sensitivity).Solution D: LAL water as a negative control.Procedure: Preparation tested on MVD (1: 400) \u2013 so-lutions 1, 2, 3 and 4.The test is valid if the following condition is met:The both replicates in the solutions 2 and 3 of the pro-cedure are positive, while being negative in the solution 4. The tested preparation meets the test if there is a nega-tive result for both replicates in solution 1. If a positive re-sult is obtained on both replicates of solution 1diluted on MVD, it does not meet the test. If a positive result is ob-tained on both replicates of solution 1 diluted to dilution less than the MVD, the test will be repeated with dilution which does not exceed the MVD or at the level of MVD.S2 PP 103224Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 223 - 224 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsMethod BDilutions for preparation testing, and which are not higher than MVD 1:1; 1:2; 1:4; 1:8; 1:10; 1:100; 1:200 and 1:400.The following test solutions were prepared:Solution A: Test solution diluted lower than MVD (test for interfering factors).Solution B: Undiluted test solution containing CSE at the concentration of 2\u03bb (Positive Product Control).Solution C: Calibration curve of the endotoxin control standard (CSE) and LAL water - concentrations equivalent to 2\u03bb, \u03bb, \u03bb/2 and \u03bb/4 (Confirmation test for the declared ly-sate sensitivity).Solution D: LAL water as a negative control.The test is valid if the following three conditions are met:1. The both replicates of solution D (negative control) are negative.2. The both replicates of solution B (positive product control) are positive.3. Geometric mean of the final points in solution C is in the range of 2\u03bb to \u03bb/2.Results and discussionMethod AThe obtained test results in Solution A are satisfactory i.e. the preparation does not contain detectable endotoxins. In Solution B with the dilution of 1:300 the interference factors exceeded, while the obtained result 0.2102 EU / ml is within the permissible limits of 2 \u03bb to \u03bb/2 (0.25 EU / ml to 0.0625 EU / ml). The declared lysate sensitivity in solu-tion C is confirmed and the obtained result 0.2102 EU/ml is within the limits of 2 \u03bb to \u03bb/2 (0.25 EU/ml to 0.0625EU/ml). The obtained negative results in Solution D satisfy the test. In the mentioned procedure, both replicates in solution 2 (Positive Product Control) and solution 3 (Positive Water Control) are positive, while the both replicates in solution 1 (Negative Product Control) and solution 4 (Negative Wa-ter Control) are negative.Method A The obtained result 0.003525 EU/ml i.e. 0.0003525 EU/mg (allowed < 5IU/mg) in Solution A meets the quali-ty specifications and the preparation does not interfere with the test. The obtained results of the both replicates in so-lution B (Positive Product Control)  are positive and the results satisfy the test. Declared lysate sensitivity in solu-tion C was confirmed and the obtained result 0.0884 EU/ml is within the limits of 2 \u03bb to \u03bb/2 (0.25 EU/ml to 0.0625 EU/ml). The obtained results of the both replicates in so-lution D (Negative Water Control) are negative and the re-sults satisfy the test.ConclusionThe obtained value of the lysate sensitivity determined by Method A.Gel-Clot method: the limit and test method B.Gel-Cloth method:quantitative test is within the limits of 2\u03bb to \u03bb/2.The advantage of Method B compared to Method A is the option it has to determine concentration of endotox-in on unknown sample (a sample with unknown composi-tion declaredand endotoxin limit concentration not listed).Using the Method A, with dilution of 1:300, the inter-ference factors exceeded and the preparation meets the test i.e. neither false positive nor false negative results were ob-tained.Using the Method B, with dilutions of 1:200, the fac-tors of interference started exceeding, while complete-ly exceeded at dilution 1:400, which leads to a conclusion that Method B confirms the results of Method A since the dilution of 1:300 in Method A with exceeded interference factors in the range between 1:200 and 1:400.ReferencesEuropean Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2014.

Majka Tereza No 47 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* kokolanski@live.comAs technological innovations advanced so did the medical devices that became part of surgery (so called in-vasive surgery) from the mid 19th century onward.  There are many medical devices that are used in diverse surgical procedures on a daily basis (medical equipment and instru-ments). Medical devices covers a wide spectrum of differ-ent technological devices starting from simple depressors to complex, highly-technical and computerized devices. They play a crucial role in healthcare, whether in small, ru-ral healthcare facilities or in expert medical diagnostic and treatment centers (Radisic, 2008). An additional proof of their necessity and significance is the fact that many gov-ernments across the world provide more than one billion Euros for medical purposes (WHO, 2003). The purpose of this paper is to address the necessity of legal regulation of the types of liabilities of the entities in-volved for damage caused by using the medical devices in the R. Macedonia.The technological advance of the modern medical de-vices is one of the most important elements of an efficient healthcare system. However, specific medical devices can be hazardous to the health of the medical staff or patients. There are numerous risks such as: improper alignment of the medical device, improper and inadequate usage of it, inadequate maintenance, and inadequate supervision be-fore and after usage, breaking down of the medical device as well as the existence of dysfunctional medical devic-es. The medical devices that are most harmful for the pa-tients\u2019 inner and outer body are the ones with specific us-age, features, positioning and way of usage. (Tupanchevs-ki et al., 2012)  Having in mind the increased usage of different medi-cal devices that are harmful to the patients\u2019 overall health, the liability of the inflicted harm is also a big legal prob-lem. Furthermore, this represents a complex social and le-gal problem, not just because it hasn\u2019t been regulated by specific legal norms, but because it has been expanding rapidly as well.The liability for the damage caused by the use of med-ical devices in most legal systems as it is the case with Re-public of Macedonia is not separately regulated. On the contrary, the liability is regulated by several laws of differ-ent legal disciplines. Namely the types of liability for the caused damage from using of medical devices can be the following: a) disciplinary liability (for which the most se-vere sanction includes the health worker\u2019s loss of licence), b) civil liability (that results in liability for compensation due to individual error which leads to a violation of pa-tient\u2019s rights) c) misdemeanor  liability (which usually en-tail a fine for inflicting minor injuries) and d) criminal lia-bility (in cases where besides individual interests, it is nec-essary to ensure the protection of the wider social inter-est). However, despite this classification, the abovemen-tioned forms are mutually intertwined and complementa-ry to some extent, which means, whenever possible, it is necessary to avoid multiple punishments (Davitkovski et al., 2009). The health workers are not solely responsible for the damage caused by using different types of medical devic-es. The manufacturer or the importer, the health institution and the people in charge of the health institution, should also take legal liability.Civil liability is determined and accomplished by gen-eral legal rules liable for any caused damage. Above all, these are rules  for personal liability, which is based on the guilt of the health worker and the liability rules of the le-gal entity (healthcare facility) for any damage caused by the employee to a third party. This liability arises as a con-sequence of violating contractual or legal duties of health professionals related to medical devices, and qualifies as a S2 PP 104226Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 225 - 226 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsmedical error. Nevertheless, the rules of objective liability (liability regardless of fault) are no exception in terms of rules of personal liability, but have a special scope of ap-plication that is defined by general terms such as: danger-ous object and dangerous activity. The rules of liability for dangerous objects or dangerous activities have their field of application, and in that context can be used in all cir-cumstances under which the damage is caused by the use of medical devices that have been labeled as dangerous ob-jects. Therefore, apart from health workers, the manufac-turer of the medical device and the holder of the dangerous object are also deemed as liable for the damage (Radisic, 2008). The compensation for the harm caused by medical devices is established in the Law on Obligations (Assem-bly of the Republic of Macedonia, 2001).Criminal liability of health professionals, legal entities and responsible persons in the legal entity is established in the Criminal Code, in the chapter \u2013 criminal violations of people\u2019s overall health are provided the following crimes: Unscrupulous treatment of the ill (Article 207), as well as manufacturing and using of harmful devices for treatment (Article 212), (Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, 1996).Misdemeanor liability of the entities is established in Chapter VI Penalty Sanctions Law on Medicines and Medical Devices (Assembly of the Republic of Macedo-nia, 2007). Disciplinary liability of health workers stems from the codes of professional ethical duties and rights of health care workers, who make the respective chambers, and whose obligation for the Chambers derives from Arti-cle 250, Paragraph 3 of the Law on Health Protection (As-sembly of the Republic of Macedonia, 2012).The liability for the damage that may be caused by the use of medical devices is governed by several laws. The manufacturer or the importer of medical devices, the re-sponsible person in the legal person, public health officials and the health facility are deemed liable criminally, civilly, and disciplinary for the inflicted damage.ReferencesAssembly of the Republic of Macedonia, 1996.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* ageorgieva@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionRegulatory authorities FDA and ICH are encourag-ing and promoting implementation of Quality by Design (QbD) principles in the pharmaceutical industry environ-ment (ICH, 2008; ICH, 2009; Reid et al., 2013; Sangshet-ti et al., 2014). It is a current trend among pharmaceutical industry that a method development process is done by im-plementing an Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD), as a part of risk management, pharmaceutical development, and pharmaceutical quality system. The application of QbD concept to analytical method is justifiable, because of many variables that significantly affect the method results (Peraman et al., 2015).There is no single QbD approach to chromatographic method development. A systematic approach that is broad-ly-applicable includes the following steps: establishing the critical quality attributes (CQAs), creating an experimental design that includes screening and optimization, defining an operational design space and defining a control strategy (McBrien, 2010; Salman and Vinayak, 2014). Quality is guaranteed with robustness and reproduc-ibility of the method that with this approach is built in method development stage. Submission is based on prod-uct knowledge and assured by analytical target profile (ATP). Method flexibility, meaning allowed movement within method operable design region (MODR) and con-tinuous improvement that can be done without prior reg-ulatory approval, are one of the benefits that come along with this approach. Materials and methodsQbD approach for development of a high pressure re-versed phase liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for determination of impurities in a drug product that contains two active ingredients and five known impurities was per-formed. Several common critical parameters in HPLC - gra-dient time, pH of the aqueous eluent, type of organic modi-fier, temperature and stationary phase were evaluated with-in the quality by design framework by the means of comput-er modelling software Fusion AE. Agilent 1290 Infinity auto-mated method development system equipped with a column and solvent selection valves was used. As for initial chemis-try screening of our experiment setup, four different column chemistries were tested: Zorbax SB-CN, Zorbax Eclipse XDB-Phenyl, Zorbax Eclipse XDB-CN, and Zorbax Eclipse Plus Phenyl-Hexyl, to maximize selectivity. Five different pH levels of 50 mM ammonium formate buffer in a pH range of 3.5-5.5 were tested and two organic modifiers, acetoni-trile and methanol. Column temperature was varied in the in-terval 20-50 \u00b0C. Gradient time was set variable, from 28 to 30 minutes. As constant variables were set flow rate (0.7 ml/min), injection volume (20\u00b5l), initial and final hold time (2 and 10 minutes, respectively), initial and final hold percent organic (25 and 100 percent, respectivelly). An experimental design was converted in redy to run sequence with 62 chromatografic runs, along with columns equlibratin stages. We run the experiment and analyze the data. The experimental results were import back to Fusion AE and processed to generate an initial method for sub-sequent optimization. We set a specific goal for each re-sponse along with lower and upper acceptability limits for the solution search as follows: number of peaks - target 7, number of peaks that have USP resolution \u2265 1.50, target 6 and number of peaks that have USP Tailing \u2264 2.0, target 7. S2 PP 105228Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 227 - 228 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsResults and discussionAs stage one of our experiment based on QbD princi-ples, analytical target profile was defined. The goal of this analytical method development process was getting a ro-bust method for determination and quantification of relat-ed compounds of our drug product. The criteria for the suc-cessful separation (defined critical quality attribute) is tree fold: detection of all peak of interest, maximum critical resolution and USP tailing factor.The software carried out a number of solution search-es equal to the number of runs in the experiment design, with the specific goal settings of the experiment run as the starting point. The software then ranked the result of each search in terms of relative goodness (closeness to meeting or exceeding all goals). It then displayed the best overall answers in decreasing rank (LC Method Development Tu-torial, Fusion QbD Quality by Design Software, S-Matrix Corporation, 2014, Version 9.7). All parameters were stud-ied in combination, thus defining a multi-dimensional de-sign space. Fusion AE enable visualization of the effect of each factor on the separation. This visualization of the de-sign space was found very helpful in thorough understand-ing on the impact of each variable on method performanc-es (Monks et al., 2011). By changing the factors on each axis, the design space was explored in detail. Column Zor-bax SB-CN and acetonitrile were found to be optimal, as the acceptable performance region for these variables was found to be the broadest. The initial method was further optimized in experiment where secondary effectors such as column temperature, initial gradient slope and strong sol-vent percent and flow rate were varied. After processing the results, the final optimized method was generated. ConclusionHPLC analytical procedure for related and degrada-tion products in new pharmaceutical product was devel-oped, using the AQbD approach. Column Zorbax SB-CN, 50 mM ammonium formate buffer pH 4.5 as weak and ace-tonitrile as strong solvent in a gradient time of 28 minutes and column temperature of 20 \u00b0C were established as in-put variables that fulfil the goals set at the very beginning, thus defining a well-known and understandable multi-di-mensional method operable design region. This kind of approach to analytical method develop-ment gave us better understanding of method variables, since they were studied in combination. Given the large amount of chromatographic information contained in gen-erated models, these offer a sound foundation for method troubleshooting and to justify continuous future improve-ment.An automated method development using Fusion AE software take less time compared to manual method de-velopment, but also requires a huge understanding in se-lection of input variables and output response. QbD means the right analysis at the right time, based on science and risk assessment. This way of understanding and practic-ing the AQbD  is current area of focus and needs to be im-plemented.ReferencesInternational conference on harmonization of technical Requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH), 2008.

Cyril and Methodious\u201d, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* marijazafirova@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionMoxifloxacin is a fourth generation fluoroquinolone an-tibacterial agent, active against Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria, developed primarily for the treat-ment of community acquired pneumonia and upper respi-ratory tract infections (Balfour and Wiseman, 1999). Var-ious procedures have been developed for the synthesis of the drug during which different process-related impuri-ties are formed. Isolation and structural identification has been achieved for many of the synthesis-related impurities (Bayer, 2000; Kumar et al., 2004, Petersen, 2006). A num-ber of methods have been developed for the determination of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and its related substances, based on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatog-raphy (HPLC) (Dewani et al., 2011; Djurdjevic et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2014). Ultra high performance liquid chroma-tography (UPLC) is a relatively new technique which of-fers several advantages over conventional high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), especially substantially de-creased time of analysis and reduced solvent consumption while retaining chromatographic efficiency, resolution and sensitivity (Swartz, 2005). The aim of our study was to de-velop and optimize an UPLC method for determination of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and its related impurities.Materials and methodsMoxifloxacin hydrochloride and its five impurities: (1) 8-hydroxy quinolonic acid, (2) 8-methoxy quinolonic acid, (3) ethyl quinolonic ester, (4) 8-hydroxy moxifloxacin and (5) N-methyl piperazine were used for this study. Stock so-lutions were prepared in methanol at the concentration lev-el of 1 mg/ml for moxifloxacin and 0.1 mg/ml for each of the selected impurities. The resolution solution of moxi-floxacin and its related impurities was prepared by diluting the stock solutions in mobile phase A, to the final concen-tration of 0.4 \u03bcg/ml for each compound. The chromatographic analysis was conducted on Shi-madzu Nexera UPLC system equipped with PDA detector. The separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18, 50 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm chromatographic column, using gradient elution of mobile phase  B (%): 0-2 min: 19%; 2-6 min: from 19% to 67%; 6-8 min: from 67% to 27%; 8-8.1: from 27% to 19%; 8.1-9 min: 19%. Mobile phase A was a mixture of aqueous phase pH=2.2 (containing 0.16 mol/L phosphoric acid and 1 ml/L trifluoroacetic acid, adjusted to pH 2.2 with triethylamine) and methanol (85:15 v/v). Mo-bile phase B consisted of a mixture of methanol and water (80:20 v/v). The column temperature was maintained at 50 \u02daC and the flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. Injection volume was 5 \u03bcL and the total run time for analysis was 9 min. Moxi-floxacin and its impurities were recorded at 296 nm.Results and discussionOptimization of the method started by varying the composition and the pH of the mobile phase, using isocratic and gradient elution. Two aqueous mobile phases were ex-amined, one containing potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and the other containing phosphoric acid, at three pH values (2.2; 5.5; 6.0), maintaing the column temperature at 25 \u02daC. The studied compounds were partially separated by isocrat-ic elution, therefore to achieve full separation, gradient elu-tion was used. The best separation and peak symmetry were observed with the aqueous phase containing phosphoric S2 PP 106230Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 229 - 230 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsacid at pH=2.2, therefore it was selected for further analy-sis. Under these conditions, 8-methoxyquinolonic acid and ethylquinolonic ester impurities were not resolved at all. In order to achieve their separation, column temperature was gradually increased. Satisfactory resolution was achieved at 50 \u02daC. In order to obtain adequate sensitivity the injec-tion volume was also varied. Optimal results were obtained using injection volume of 5 \u03bcL. According to the litera-ture data, the wavelength was optimized in the range from 290-296 nm (Djurdjevic et al., 2009). The wavelength of maximum absorption was selected according to the record-ed UV spectrum of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride, which was 296 nm. Different diluents for preparation of the reso-lution solution were tested as well. The best peak shape of the studied compounds was observed using mobile phase A as diluent. The final step in the optimization process was the selection of the best conditions for gradient elution. There-fore, the ratio of mobile phase B, the flow rate and the gra-dient steps were optimized. Best peak shape and resolu-tion with optimal run time was acquired using gradient elu-tion of mobile phase B (%): 0-2 min: 19%; 2-6 min: from 19% to 67%; 6-8 min: from 67% to 27%; 8-8.1: from 27% to 19%; 8.1-9 min: 19%. Using the finally optimized chro-matographic conditions a critical resolution between 8-me-thoxy quinolonic acid and ethyl quinolonic ester of 1,8 was obtained. All the peaks of the studied compounds have a good symmetrical shape, with maximum tailing factor of 1.3 for the peak of 8-hydroxy moxifloxacin. The number of theoretical plates (tp) shows suitable column efficiency, with a minimum NTP of 1770 tp/column for the peak of N-methyl piperazine. The obtained values for signal to noise (minimal value of 11.9 for the peak of 8-hydroxy moxi-floxacin) confirmed the sensitivity of the method. All of the aforementioned parameters indicate on a satisfactory per-formance of the chromatographic system.ConclusionAn UPLC method for quantitative determination of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and its related impurities was developed and optimized. The method is simple and sen-sitive and the studied impurities were separated with ex-cellent resolution in only 9 minutes. The results from our study indicate that, after proper validation, the proposed method could be used for routine analysis of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and its related substances as an active ingre-dient and in pharmaceutical dosage forms as well.ReferencesBalfour, J.A., Wiseman, L.R., 1999.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* vpopovska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionFluoroquinolone as active compound belongs to a class of synthetic antimicrobial agents. Fluoroquinolones absorb radiation energy in the ultraviolet range. A loss of antibacterial activity was observed after UV exposure, as a result of changed colour, decreased assay and increased degradation products, suggesting photodegradation of the active substance. Regarding to this, selection of an appro-priate packaging to protect the drug product from light and a storage advice is necessary to be established.The photodegradation itself has not yet been docu-mented, as well as no information has been so far provided on the nature of the photoproducts. For some fluoroquino-lones, however, metabolites have been identified with re-duced antibacterial activity (Eva-Maria et al., 1993).In order to demonstrate that appropriate light expo-sure does not lead to unacceptable changes in dosage form, photostability testing was performed on the drug solution, as part of formal stability study ICH guideline Q1A (R2) (Blessy et al., 2014). Materials and methodsPhoto stability study was conducted according to ICH guideline Q1B \u201dPhoto stability Testing of New Drug Sub-stances and Products\u201d- Option 1. Testing was performed on one batch of Alkaloid\u2019s drug product, solution packed in glass colorless ampoules as primary packaging and cardboard boxes as secondary packaging, using following methods:Determination of colour of solution: Ph.Eur 2.2.2 method and visual methodDetermination of assay and related and degradation compounds of the drug product: validated in-house HPLC methods.The formulation was examined at confirmatory stor-age conditions: exposure time in the visible range is 7.1 hours, which corresponds to an illumination of 1.2 million lux hours and in the UV range 2.9 hours, which corresponds to an integrated near ultraviolet energy of 200 Wh/m2.In first phase of photostabilty study, samples and pla-cebo, were exposed outside the immediate pack, placed in a quartz Erlenmeyer\u2019s with stoppers, alongside with pro-tected sample and placebo (solutions placed in amber glass volumetric flasks) used as a dark control to evaluate the contribution of thermally induced change.In the second phase, the samples and placebo were ex-posed in primary packaging to the same conditions.In the last, third phase, the samples and placebo were exposedin the secondary packaging as intended for mar-keting, also to the same conditions.After treatment, samples were examined for any changes in physical properties: i). colour of solution with visual meth-od; ii). determination of assay with HPLC method and iii). determination of degradation products with HPLC method.Results and discussionIn this study, photo stability of the drug product and degradation pathways of the active substance was fully de-terminate and understood. After the exposure for 2.9 hours to an integrated near ultraviolet energy of 200 Wh/m2, the assay of the active component was slightly decreased in both samples, the sam-S2 PP 107232Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 231 - 232 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsples outside of primary packing and samples in the prima-ry packaging. The decrease in the assay was followed with changed levels of impurity amount significantly for the specified impurity C, susceptible to light degradation (Hani et al., 2015; Mohammad and Zaynab, 2014; Ummeet al., 2013) which has increased to 0.43 and 0.47%, respectively.All samples have shown change in colour, compared with Ph.Eur. Reference standard solution GY4, used for determination of the colour.After the exposure for 7.1 hours to an illumination of 1.2 million lux hours in the visible range, the obtained re-sults from the opened samples and samples in the primary packaging were very similar. The assay of the active com-ponent was decreased to 97.82% and 97.50% respective to the increased amount of the specified impurity in the lev-el above the qualification threshold, 0.76% and 0.74%, re-spectively. Also, both samples have shown change in the colour of the drug product.No changes were noticed in the amount of the un-known impurities in all treated samples at end of exposure. Alongside with the drug product, placebo solution was also stressed in order to exclude those impurities that are not degradation products, which was found stable during the photo stability study.In the dark control samples and samples in the second-ary packaging, no changes have been observed at the end of exposure period.Data review of the tests on the exposed drug product outside the immediate packaging as well as in the primary packaging suggest that the drug product is sensitive to light and should be kept in the secondary packaging. The sec-ondary packaging, cardboard box, provides sufficient pro-tection, where the physical properties, assay and impurity levels are comparable to the untreated samples.ConclusionFrom the results for colour, assay and related and deg-radation products, obtained from conducted photo stabil-ity study on the drug product, it has been concluded that the drug product, containing fluoroquinolone, is suscepti-ble to photo degradation and loss of antibacterial activity. No photo degradation was observed at the third phase of performed study, confirming that product should be kept in its original package in order to be protected from light.With regard to data presented, the SmPC and label-ling sections for the drug product should be amended with a storage advice: \u2018Store in the original package to protect from light\u2019.ReferencesBlessy, M., Ruchi, D.P., Prajesh, N., Prajapati, Y.K.A. 2014.

It acts pri-marily as partial agonist of D2 receptors. It is also a partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptors, and like other atypical antipsychotics displays an antagonist profile binding to the 5-HT2A receptors. Aripiprazole has moderate affinity for histamine and alpha adrenergic receptors, and no apprecia-ble affinity for cholinergic muscarinic receptors 1-2 (Ra-vindra et al., 2014). Chemically, it is 7-[4-[4-(2, 3-dichlo-rophenyl) piperazin-1-yl] butoxy]-3, 4-dihydro-1H-quino-lin-2-one. Organic impurities can arise during the manufactur-ing process or storage of a drug substance, and include starting materials, intermediates and degradation products (ICH, 2006). In this study, retention behavior of aripipra-zole and its five impurities was investigated. The follow-ing impurities were analyzed: hydroxy quinoline impuri-ty (Impurity A): 7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydro quinolin-2 (1H)-one; piperazine impurity (Impurity B): 1-(2,3-dichloro-phenyl)piperazine hydrochloride; diquinoline impurity (Impurity C): 7,7\u2019-(butylenedioxy)di-3,4-dihydroquino-lin-2(1H)-one; chlorobutoxyquinoline impurity (Impuri-ty D): 7-(4-chlorobutoxy)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one and N-oxide impurity (Impurity E): N-oxide-7-[4-{4-(2,3-dichlorophenil)-1-piperazinyl}butoxy]-3,4-dihydroquino-lin-2(1H)-one. \u03b2-Cyclodextrins (\u03b2-CDs) are macrocyclic oligosaccha-rides composed of seven \u03b1-D-glucopyranose units joined in a cone-shaped structure (Chen et al., 2004). They exhib-it a hydrophobic cavity delimited by two rims, a wide and a narrow one, composed of secondary and primary hydroxyl groups (Fifere et al., 2012). This structure enables \u03b2-CDs to generate inclusion complexes with a wide variety of hy-drophobic organic compounds in aqueous solutions. In an-alytical chemistry \u03b2-CDs could be used as mobile phase additives, in order to reduce the amount of organic solvents and introduce the concepts of green chemistry.The aim of the present study was to investigate the re-tention behavior of aripiprazole and its five impurities us-ing High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method and applying the concepts of green analytical chemistry. The influence of \u03b2-CD on retention behavior of aripiprazole and its five impurities was examined, in order to shorten retention times with smaller percentage of ace-tonitrile, as an organic modifier.Materials and methodsAll experiments were carried out on Thermo Scientif-ic, Dionex Ultra 3000 equipped with PDA detector. Chro-matographic separation was performed at non-polar C18 analytical column Chromolith RP-18e column (100 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, macropore size 2 \u00b5m, mesopore size 13 nm) at temperature varying from 25 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C. Injection volume was 5 \u03bcL. Mobile phase was prepared by dissolving an ap-propriate amount of \u03b2-CD in water to achieve 10 mM and 15 mM \u03b2-CD solutions. The pH was adjusted using formic acid. The mobile phase was degassed in ultrasonic bath and filtered through membrane filter prior to use. The flow rate was 1 mL/min. The detection was performed at 235, 254 and 285 nm using PDA detector. Stock solution of aripiprazole was prepared by dis-S2 PP 108234Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 233 - 234 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationssolving 500 \u03bcg of standard substance in 1 mL of HPLC wa-ter. Working solution was prepared from appropriate vol-ume of stock solution and mixture of \u03b2-CD and acetonitrile (80 : 20, v/v). The same procedures were used for prepar-ing stock and working solutions of the impurities, but the concentration of stock solutions was 100 \u03bcg/mL. All the re-agents used were of analytical grade except water and ace-tonitrile which were of HPLC grade.Results and discussionInvestigation of retention behavior of aripiprazole and its five impurities was done by varying the pH value of the mobile phase in the range from 2 to 4, the \u03b2-CD concen-tration from 10 mM to 15 mM, column temperature from 25 \u00b0C to 40 \u00b0C and acetonitrile as an organic modifier from 25% to 30%. Under the chosen acidic conditions, aripira-zole was in cationic form, as well as its impurity B and impurity E. Impurity A was in molecular form, but its re-tention time was short, which could be explained by the polarity of a molecule (logP = 1.28). Impurities C and D were in molecular forms, which probably caused longer retention times. Percentage of acetonitrile was the factor with the most significant impact on retention times of an-alyzed compounds. Although aripiprazole is a lipophilic compound (logP = 4.79), its satisfactory elution time was achieved with 25% of acetonitrile. The same amount of acetonitrile was used for impurities, which were also most-ly lipophilic. LogP values of impurities B, C, D and E are 2.79, 2.95, 2.52 and 4.18, respectively. It was recognized from the recent literature reports that reducing the consumption of organic solvents intro-duces an environment-friendly approach to drug analysis (Cielecka-Piontek et al., 2013). The mobile phase consist-ing of \u03b2-CD could play an important role in reducing the amount of acetonitrile. Taking into consideration the struc-ture of \u03b2-CD, there was a possibility for building inclusion complexes with aripiprazole or its impurities, which could shorten the time of analysis. The higher column tempera-ture also shortens the retention times of all the analyzed compounds. The change in \u03b2-CD concentration from 10 mM to 15 mM did not have a significant influence on the retention times. Based on all described facts it was decid-ed to work with 15 mM \u03b2-CD. Also, it was decided that the percentage of acetonitrile could be 30% and the col-umn temperature should be set at 40 \u00b0C. Retention time of aripiprazole under these circumstances was 5.343 min, impurity A 1.717 min, impurity B 2.067 min, impurity C 10.917 min, impurity D 10.773 min and impurity E 5.940 min. From the obtained UV spectra the most appropriate wavelength for monitoring the compounds was decided to be 254 nm. Finally, although aripiprazole and its five im-purities differ in structure and polarity, using HPLC meth-od with \u03b2-CD solution as mobile phase additive, they could be separated in single analytical run.ConclusionThe present study shows that \u03b2-CD has an important influence on retention behavior of aripiprazole and its five impurities. Reducing the amount of organic solvents by using \u03b2-CD solutions as mobile phases is a great advan-tage and step forward to limit the exposure to toxic agents, without decreasing the sensitivity and resolution of deter-mination. Under these circumstances the proposed HPLC method could be successfully used for separation of aripip-razole and its five impurities. Besides, another advantage of proposed method is the compliance with the novel trend in analytical method development according to which it is recommended to use methods suitable for adopting the en-vironment-friendly approach to pharmaceutical analysis.AcknowledgmentThese results are part of the Project no. 172033, fi-nanced by the Ministry of education, science and techno-logical development of the Republic of Serbia.ReferencesChen, D., Jiang, S., Chen, Y., Hu, Y., 2004.

De-pending on the therapeutic indication, the therapeutic in-dex and other characteristics of the drug, dose dumping can pose a significant risk to patients, either because of safe-ty issues or diminished efficacy or both. Generally dose dumping is observed as a result of an impairment of the release-rate-controlling mechanism. Some prolonged-re-lease oral dosage forms contain drugs and excipients that exhibit higher solubility in ethanol solutions compared to water solutions. Such products can be expected to exhibit a more rapid drug dissolution and release rate in the pres-ence of ethanol. Therefore, when a prolong-release prod-uct is consumed with alcohol, the prolong-release mecha-nism could be adversely affected, which could lead to dose dumping.Where appropriate, based on the risk of dose dumping when a prolonged-release drug product is consumed with alcohol, the prolonged-release drug products labeling in-cludes warnings against the consumption of alcohol while taking the drug product. Even with significant warnings in the labeling, the consequences of concomitant alcohol use need to be considered for certain drug products because alcohol use may still be likely and such alcohol use may lead to dose dumping, which could result in serious ad-verse events especially for certain narrow therapeutic in-dex drugs.Mitigating the risks of alcohol-induced dose dumping is an issue that puts great demands on formulators, regula-tory agencies and the industry at large. Over the last few years, the pharmaceutical industry has become increasing-ly concerned with the topic of alcohol-induced dose dump-ing, which can lead to dangerous or even potentially lethal side effects. The goal of the regulatory approach should be to minimize the risk of alcohol-induced dose dumping from prolonged-release dosage forms, irrespective of any warnings on product labeling and instructions by health care providers (Meyer et al.,2005). To address the prob-lem, regulatory guidelines have been implemented, result-ing in the need for new formulation approaches.Guidelines in Europe and the United States In the European Union, all prolonged-released formu-lations must be evaluated for alcohol-induced dose dump-ing risk. Effects of alcohol for generic oral formulations, in vitro studies of the release in alcohol solutions should be performed. Where accelerated active substance release is seen in vitro either at high or low alcohol concentrations over a short period of time or at lower alcohol concentra-tions over a longer period of time, the product should be re-formulated. If the alcohol effect cannot be avoided and it is present also in the reference product, the applicant should justify / demonstrate that it lacks of clinical relevance or discuss the possible clinical relevance in comparison to the reference product. EMA guidelines show a path for deci-sion-making for formulators (Friebe et al., 2005). Differences are present in US and EU regulations. Ac-cording to EMA guideline the prolonged-released product must undergo in vitro testing in the presence of 20% al-cohol concentration (EMA, 2014). On the other hand, the United States\u2019 Federal Drug Administration (FDA, 2015), requires in vitro testing in concentrations up to 40% alco-S2 PP 109236Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 235 - 236_ (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationshol for a list of defined generic formulations (Friebe et al., 2005). Nevertheless, the applicant should discuss the signif-icance of any out of specification results, particularly at the early time points, together with consideration of the risks of dose dumping and accelerated release. Appropriate warnings in the summary of product characteristics should be proposed and justified (EMA, 2015).With respect to increasing globalization of pharmaceu-ticals, harmonization of the regulatory guidelines for in vi-tro ADD resistance testing is highly desirable. It should be based on a common understanding of the physiological im-pacts of alcohol consumption and realistic exposure times.Materials and methodsComparative dissolution tests of prolonged-release tablets containing BCS Class I active substance in three different media have been performed: buffer pH 6.8 (solu-tion of sodium hydroxide and potassium dihydrogen phos-phate in water R) also proposed for routine testing, buffer pH 4.5 (solution of sodium acetate R and acetic acid in wa-ter R) and medium pH 1.2 (solution of hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride in water R), each of them with and without 20% ethanol. The level of alcohol in the medium mimics level that can be reached in the fluids of the gastro-intestinal tract following alcohol consumption.Dissolution tests have been performed, using basket apparatus (Apparatus I) at 100 rpm, in 500 ml aforemen-tioned media at 37\u00b10.5 \u00b0C for a total period of 24 hours. Dissolution profiles were obtained with sampling at 8 time points on 12 individual units. The dissolution rate of the prolonged-release drug product has been determined using in-house validated HPLC method. Results and discussionIn vitro dissolution studies with alcohol have been per-formed to evaluate whether ethanol ingestion may modify the release characteristics of the drug product.To demonstrate in vitro similarity of the dissolution profiles performed in media with and without ethanol, \u01922 statistic method was employed.The results of the performed comparative dissolution tests of prolonged-release tablets in the dissolution medi-um proposed for routine testing, but with alcohol, are with-in the specification limits.Furthermore the \u01922 statistic method indicates similar-ity between the dissolution profile in the presence of al-cohol and the dissolution profile of the same batch in the same media in absence of alcohol, for all three dissolution media. ConclusionThe conducted in vitro dissolution studies demonstrate that there is no potential risk of alcohol-induce dose dump-ing for the tested prolonged-release drug product.ReferencesCommittee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), 2014.

Proper function-ing and performance of software and computer systems play a major role in obtaining consistency, reliability and accuracy of data. Therefore, computer system validation (CSV) should be part of any good development and manufacturing practice. It is also requested by EU and FDA regulations and guidelines through the overall requirement that \u201cequipment must be suit-able for its intended use\u201d.Specific requirements for computers can be found in sec-tion 211.68 of the US cGMP regulations (USC, 2008). \u2022 Automatic, mechanical, or electronic equipment or other types of equipment, including computers, or related systems that will perform a function satis-factorily, may be used in the manufacture, process-ing, packing, and holding of a drug product. If such equipment is so used, it shall be routinely calibrat-ed, inspected, or checked according to a written pro-gram designed to assure proper performance. Writ-ten records of those calibration checks and inspec-tions shall be maintained.\u2022 Appropriate controls shall be exercised over comput-er or related systems to assure that changes in master production and control records or other records are instituted only by authorized personnel.\u2022 Input to and output from the computer or related system of formulas or other records or data shall be checked for accuracy.\u2022 The degree and frequency of input/output verifica-tion shall be based on the complexity and reliability of the computer or related system.\u2022 A backup file of data entered into the computer or re-lated system shall be maintained except where cer-tain data, such as calculations performed in connec-tion with laboratory analysis, are eliminated by com-puterization or other automated processes. In such instances a written record of the program shall be maintained along with appropriate validation data.\u2022 Hard copy or alternative systems, such as duplicates, tapes, or microfilm, shall be designed to assure that backup data are exact and complete and that it is se-cure from alteration, inadvertent erasures, or loss shall be maintained.Specific requirements for computers and electronic re-cords and signatures are also defined in FDA\u2019s regulations 21 CFR Part 11 on electronic Records and Signatures (USC, 1997).The Good Automated Manufacturing Practices Forum (GAMP) has developed guidelines for computer validation. All these guidelines and publications follow a couple of prin-ciples:\u2022 Validation of computer systems is not a onetime event. It starts with the definition of the product or project and setting user requirement specifications and cover the vendor selection process, installation, initial operation, going use, and change control and system retirement.\u2022 All publications refer to some kind of life cycle mod-el with a formal change control procedure being an important part of the whole process. \u2022 There are no detailed instructions on what should be tested. All guidelines refer to risk assessment for the extent of validation.Validation of computer systems is not a once off event. Annex 11 of the European GMP directive is very clear about this: Validation should be considered as part of the complete life cycle of a computer system. This cycle includes the stag-es of planning, specification, programming, testing, commis-sioning, documentation, operation, monitoring and modify-ing\u201d (EC, 2010).Scope The scope of this work is to present the validation of ERP SAP computer system used in Alkaloid AD Skopje known as AlkaSAP system.S2 PP 110238Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 237 - 238 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsBackgroundAlkaSAP system was implemented in Alkaloid AD Sko-pje in 2007. Within AlkaSAP there are several \u2018modules\u2019, each of which contains transactions in order to perform nec-essary tasks to complete business processes. Several of these tasks and processes are considered critical or have regulatory implications to Alkaloid. The SAP implemented modules in Alkaloid AD Skopje in 2007 were: 1.

There are 400 \u2013 500 compounds that have been identified in its extracts, and among them approximately 70 are C21 terpenophenols, members of a group known as cannabinoids, specific for this plant (ElSohly and Slade, 2005; Fischedick, et al., 2009; Turn-er, et al., 1980). The constituent of Cannabis sativa L., \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u22069THC), is the primary psychoac-tive cannabinoid. Given that the main pharmacological and psychoactive effects have been attributed to this com-pound, the most of the studies have been focused on its ef-fects (Costa, 2007). The effects of Cannabis sativa L. are not solely due to \u22069THC because cannabidiol (CBD) was found to cause pharmacological effects (Russo and Guy, 2006). It was shown that CBD and other cannabinoids achieve synergy with \u22069THC causing potentiation of ben-efits, antagonism of adverse effects, summation, pharma-cokinetic advantages, and metabolism (Russo and Guy, 2006). Many countries became more liberal towards medici-nal use of Cannabis sativa L. (Baker et al., 2003). Recent-ly there has been an increasing interest in development of cannabinoids and Cannabis sativa L. preparations as legiti-mate medicines for a variety of medical applications. Some of them include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, glaucoma, asthma and cardiovascular condi-tions, and as an antiemetic (Williamson and Evans, 2000). Cannabidoids are very potent compounds and their control in Cannabis sativa L. preparations is very important, espe-cially because their potential users are patients which al-ready have serious health problems. The aim of this study was to apply our in-house HPLC/DAD method on the Cannabis sativa L. preparations pres-ent in the European market and to control their quality.Materials and methodsThe samples of Cannabis sativa L. preparations were purchased from the European market, produced by Endoca (Pharmaceutical Company, Denmark). The standard sub-stances were obtained from Lipomed AG (Switzerland). The samples of standard substances were: \u22069-THC (3-pen-tyl-6,6,9-trimethyl-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-dibenzo(b,d)pyran-1-ol), delivered as 1 mL ampule solution (5 mg/ mL prepared in ethanol, with purity 98.52%, m/m) and CBD ((-)-trans-2-p-mentha-1,8-dien-3-yl-5-pentylresorcinol) as the solid substance (99.73%, m/m). The solvents used dur-ing the analysis were with HPLC grade. For the chromatographic analysis Agilent Technolo-gies HPLC system 1200 series (Germany) was used. The analysis was performed on HPLC-column: Purospher\u00ae Star RP18e (150 mm x 4.6 mm ID, 5 \u00b5m) from Merck KGaA (Germany) using mobile phase composed of ace-tonitrile and water in gradient mode with acetonitrile from 50%, V/V, to 80%, V/V, at flow rate 1.5 mL/min, tempera-ture 30 \u00b0C, detection at 220 nm, injection 10 \u00b5L, in 31 min run time. The working solutions of standard substance CBD were prepared in methanol in two concentration ranges: S2 PP 111240Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 239 - 240 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentations95.48 \u00b5g/mL \u2013 286.43 \u00b5g/mL and 103.13 \u00b5g/mL \u2013 309.40 \u00b5g/mL. The \u22069THC working solutions were prepared in methanol in concentration range: 9.81 \u00b5g/mL \u2013 19.63 \u00b5g/mL. The sample solutions were prepared by liquid/liquid extraction technique using a mixture of methanol and chlo-roform (9:1). When the layers were clearly separated, the sample from the methanolic layer was applied in HPLC/DAD system. Results and discussionFive different Cannabis sativa L. preparations pur-chased from the European market were analyzed. All were prepared from hemp oil with various amounts of CBD as active compound and naturally contains \u22069-THC, as an im-purity. According to the certificates the amount of CBD was: 3%; 5%; 10 %; 15% and 30%, m/m, and expected im-purity as \u22069THC was limited at maximum of 0.20%, m/m.For preparation of the samples we used the recom-mended United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime meth-od (UNODC Manual, 2009). For identification and quan-tification of cannabinoids we used our in-house chromato-graphic gradient method which we have proposed for hemp seed oil analysis (Shishovska et al., 2014) because of the similarity of samples in origin and form. In the analyzed samples of hemp oil preparations can-nabidiol and \u22069THC were identified and quantified. Iden-tifications were done by comparing of the retention times and UV spectra of standard compounds with retention times of peaks at the chromatograms of samples and their UV spectra. The retention times of CBD and \u22069THC peaks were 15.9 min and 21.0 min, respectively.For the quantification, data obtained from the chro-matograms were calculated using the method of the cal-ibration curve (constructed as concentration, c (\u00b5g/ml), versus peak area, A (mAU)). The analyzed working solu-tions of the active compound CBD and the trace compound \u22069THC showed high linearity in the working ranges. The estimated coefficient of the linearity for CBD working so-lutions at concentration range: 95.48 \u00b5g/mL \u2013 286.43 \u00b5g/mL was 1.000 (A = 23688 c + 16.188); while for the CBD working solutions at concentration range: 103.13 \u00b5g/mL \u2013 309.40 \u00b5g/mL it was 0.9998 (A = 39613 c + 31.129), and for the working solutions of standard substance \u22069THC at concentration range: 9.81 \u00b5g/mL \u2013 19.63 \u00b5g/mL it was 0.9997 (A = 25269 c - 7.0738).It was found that content of cannabidiol in analyzed samples is from 109.7% to 125.4%, m/m of the declared values. The assays of \u22069THC traces at the samples vary according the concentration of the active compound. As quantities of CBD at samples were lower (3 \u2013 5%), the as-say of \u22069THC is under the allowed maximum limit (0.02% \u2013 0.14%), but at samples with higher concentrations of CBD (10 \u2013 30%) the \u22069THC traces are above the allowed maximum limit (0.45% \u2013 1.14%).ConclusionThe satisfactory chromatographic data proved that our in-house gradient HPLC/DAD method can be successful-ly used for determination of the active substance CBD and traces of \u22069THC in Cannabis sativa L. preparations. The results obtained for the analyzed samples of Cannabis sati-va L. preparations showed higher amounts of CBD than de-clared value in the certificate (differences range from 9.7% m/m to 25.4%, m/m). In two samples, the amount of \u22069THC found was under allowed maximum limit of 0.20%, while in three samples the amount was above that value. Not all of the samples tested have composition as declared in the certificate, although they all origin from a European manu-facturer and are present in the European market.ReferencesBaker, D., Pryce, G., Giovannoni, G., Thompson, A.J., 2003.

G. Bonchev Str., build. 9, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria* deni@orgchm.bas.bgIntroductionNitrofurantoin (N-(5-nitro-2-furfurylidene)-1-amino-hydantoin) is antimicrobial compound, used extensively as a prophylactic for urinary tract infections in humans and animals (Maaland and Guardabassi, 2011). It is reported that the modes of action underlying DNA damage or cyto-toxicity induced by nitrofurantoin in rodent liver and lungs may involve ROS generation by reduction to nitro radi-cal anion (Suntres and Shek, 1992). A recent study showed that the drug exhibits carcinogenicity in the kidneys of male rats and the structure of the nitro furan plays a key role in the induced genotoxicity (Kijima et al., 2015).Most nitroaromatic drugs, containing nitroquinone, ni-troimidazole or nitrofuran moiety, are considered to ex-ert their toxic effect by nitro reduction (Boelsterli  et al., 2006). One-electron reduction of  the nitro group catalyzed by nitro-reductase gives rise to nitro anion  radical, the chemical instability of which promotes production of var-ious ROS such as superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical via its electron-donating ability (Wang et al., 2008).Despite these drawbacks, new nitrofuran derivatives are still being developed as antimicrobial agents (Zorzi et al., 2014). Therefore, improved knowledge on the struc-ture and reactivity of nitrofurantoin radical anion could help reduce the toxicity of the new nitrofuran antimicro-bial agents.This reports motivated us to generate electrochemi-cally the nitro radical anion of nitrofurantoin and study its chemical structure by spectroscopic IR methods and DFT computations. The radical anion was electrochemically generated and the spectral and structural changes arising from the conversion were described based on IR spectra and DFT calculations. The structural variations, electron charge distribution over molecular fragments and IR fre-quency shifting were discussed. Materials and methodsThe electrochemical generation of the radical anion of nitrofurantoin was carried out in a special CaF2 cell, provided with platinum electrodes build in the polyethyl-ene spacer. 4.5 V were applied to the cathode in the solu-tion cell containing 0.1 mol/l nitrofurantoin and equimo-lar amount of tetraethylammonium bromide in DMSO-d6. Electrochemical generation of the radical anion was con-tinued for a period of 75 min and then the polarity of the electrolysis cell was reversed in order to regenerate the parent compound. The process of nitrofurantoin reduc-tion and regeneration was monitored by recording IR spec-tra in 10 min intervals. The IR spectra were measured on a Brucker Tensor 27 FT spectrometer at a resolution of 2 cm-1 and 64 scans. All theoretical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package of programs. Geometry and vibra-tional frequencies of species studied were performed by analytical gradient technique without any symmetry con-straint. All the results were obtained using the density func-tional theory (DFT), employing the B3LYP (Becke\u2019s three-parameter non-local exchange correlation) method in con-junction with 6-311+G(2df,p) basis set. In order to account for the ifluence of the medium, we used the Integral Equa-tion Formalism Polarizable Continuum Model (IEF-PCM) on the same level of theory with inclusion of DMSO.Results and discussionThe initial IR spectrum of nitrofurantion in DMSO-d6 solution, containing tetraethylammonium bromide as S2 PP 112242Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 241 - 242 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationselectrolyte salt, showed that the asymmetric and symmet-ric stretching vibrations of the nitro group are observed at 1521 and 1350 cm-1. The stretching vibration of the N-C bond linking the nitro group to the furan ring is found at rather high wavenumber - 1211 cm-1, respectively. A few minutes after applying the current, the solution in cathode space became brown, and the bands of the anion radical of nitrofurantoin appeared in the IR spectrum. More pro-longed electrolysis (75 min) caused strong increase of the bands of the anion radical, while the bands of the neutral compound vanished. Reversal in the polarity of the elec-trolysis cell resulted in gradual decrease of the IR bands of the radical anion and reappearance of the neutral mole-cule absorptions. After 75 min of reversed electrolysis the initial spectrum of the parent compound was completely restored without the presence of any additional IR bands. This fact unambiguously demonstrates that the observed spectral changes are due to the reduction of nitrofurantoin to radical anion and not to other chemical transformations.The conversion of nitrofurantoin into radical anion is related to strong frequency decreases in the assymetric N-O stretching: \u0394\u03bdas(NO2) = 220 cm-1, strong frequency decreases in the symetric N-O stretching: \u0394\u03bds(NO2) = 209 cm-1 and strong frequency increase in C-NO2 stretching: \u0394\u03bd(C-NO2) = 273 cm-1. Based on the calculated spin den-sity, the odd electron is localized mainly on the nitro group (c.a. 70%) and in smaller extends \u2013 on the furan ring (c.a. 30%). The radical anion formation leads to simultaneous shortening of the C-N bond and lengthening of the N-O bonds.ConclusionThe observed frequency shifts arising from the con-version of nitrofurantoin into radical anion are larger than those found with the conversion of dinitrobenzenes and cy-anobenzonitriles. It is evidence that larger structural vari-ations in the nitrofuran moiety occur upon conversion into radical anion than in case of dinitrobenzenes and nitroben-zonitriles. The localization of the spin density over the ni-tro group is a sign for high reactivity of the formed nitro-furantoin radical anion and strong ability to initiate pro-duction of various ROS via electron donation. The impor-tance of aminohydantoin moiety for the stability and reac-tivity of the nitrofurantoin radical anion has to be elucidat-ed by studying other nitrofuran derivatives with modified side chains.Acknowledgements The financial support of this work by the National Sci-ence Fund of Bulgaria (Contracts RNF01/0110), Science Fund is gratefully acknowledged.ReferencesBoelsterli, U.A., Ho, H.K., Zhou, S., Leow, K.Y., 2006.

Generally, its treatment is based on immunosuppressive drugs. Azathioprine is thiopurine metabolite with immuno-suppressive and cytotoxic effects, which is used in the treat-ment of inflammatory bowel disease and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Unfortunately, about one third of patients under azathioprine therapy, have need for modify-ing or terminating the treatment because of adverse effects or low therapeutic outcome. As a prodrug of 6- mercapto-purine (6-MP), azathioprine acts through the formation of thioguanine and methylthioinosine nucleotides, which are capable of incorporating in DNA strains like \u201cfalse\u201d bases (Dervieux and Boulieu, 1998). Hence the immunosuppres-sive effect, target cells of azathioprine main metabolites - 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercapto-purine (6-MMP) are the \u201cfast-growing\u201d cells, mainly lym-phocytes, though the bone marrow and the hepatic cells are not excluded. Consequently, the risk-benefit ratio of azathi-oprine therapy is dose-dependent and here lies the crucial need for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) (Vikingsson, 2012). On the other hand, intra- and inter-individual varia-tions seem to reflect individual differences in 6-MP absorp-tion and metabolism, resulting in different bioavailability and distribution of the active metabolites in patients receiv-ing similar doses. The purpose of this study is to establish a specific, sensitive HPLC method for simultaneous deter-mination of 6-TGN and 6-MMP found in erythrocytes af-ter azathioprine administration. Materials and methodsChemicals and reagents. 6-MMP, 6-TGN and dithio-threitol (DTT- derivatization agent) were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, USA. Methanol, phosphate buffer (pH 3,5), perchloric acid, hydrochloric acid, all HPLC grade, were obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Ger-many. For all analysis, HPLC grade water was used. Zorb-ax Eclipse XDB C18 column, 150 x 4.5mm, 5 \u03bcm was sup-plied by Agilent Technologies. Erythrocyte samples. Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers (used for method validation) and from patients under azathioprine therapy (used like testing samples). Erythrocytes were extracted by centrifugation at 4 \u00b0\u0421. Further on, the eppendorf tubes were normalized on 4\u0445109 erythrocytes, and frozen at -80 \u00b0\u0421 until the analysis.Preparation of standard solutions. Stock solution of the analytes (5 \u03bcg/ml 6-TGN and 40 \u03bcg/ml 6-\u041c\u041c\u0420) were pre-pared by dissolving each compound in 0,1 M HCl. Work-ing solutions were prepared in 6 different concentrations (concentration range between 0,04 \u03bcg/ml to 2,50 \u03bcg/ml for 6-TGN and 0,25 \u03bcg/ml to 20 \u03bcg/ml for 6-\u041c\u041c\u0420) from stock solutions by dilution with 0,1 M  HCl. Calibration stan-dards were made by spiking the blank erythrocytes with appropriate volume of working solutions of 6-TGN and 6-MMP at six different concentration. Samples for qual-ity control (QC) were prepared in 4 different concentra-tions that cover the range of the calibration curve (LLOQ, low QC, medium QC, high QC appropriate for 6-TGN and 6-MMP). Sample preparation. Sample solutions were made by adding DTT in each eppendorf tube which contains 500 \u03bcl of erythrocytes from patients under azathioprine therapy. In each eppendorf tube 50 \u03bcl 70% Perchloric acid (acid hy-drolysis and deproteinization agent) was added and centri-fuged at 3000 rpm, for 15 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. After centrifu-S2 PP 113244Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 243 - 244 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsgation thiopurine nucleotides are obtained. Acid superna-tants were collected and heated at 100 \u00b0C for 45 minutes in order to release thiopurine bases after hydrolysis. Chromatographic conditions. The separation was car-ried out with Agilent 1100 HPLC system on Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18, 150 x 4.5mm, 5\u03bcm column using gradient elu-tion with methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 3,5) in ratio 5:95 (V/V) with linear gradient to 15:85 (V/V) for a period of 12 minutes and flow rate of 1,2 ml/min. The temperature was set at 25 \u00b0C with UV detection at 341 nm for 6-TGN and 304 nm for 6-MMP. Method was validated following the recommendations for validation of bioanalytical meth-ods of EMA guideline (Guideline on validation of bioana-lytical methods, European Medicines Agency, 2011). Results and discussionThe recovery values of the extraction procedure were higher than 84% for both metabolites, 6-TGN and 6-MMP. Under the proposed chromatographic conditions, no inter-fering peaks were observed in the retention time of analyt-es. The correlation coefficient from calibration curves for linearity of the method was 0.9996 for 6-TGN and 0.9989 for 6-MMP, respectively. The results for accuracy (\u00b115% of the nominal values for the QC samples and \u00b1 20% of the nominal value for the LLOQ) and precision (the val-ue for coefficient of variation should not exceed 15% for QC samples and 20% for LLOQ) were within recommend-ed limits. Stability studies indicated that no stability relat-ed problems would be expected during the routine erythro-cytes sample analysis. Samples of erythrocytes spiked with 6-TGN and 6-MMP are stable after 12 hours in the autos-ampler, 24 hours at room temperature and can be stored for up to six months at temperature of -80 \u00b0C. The inter-pretation of the measured 6-TGN and 6-MMP levels, re-spectively is following \u2013 subtherapeutic (< 235 pmol/8*108 erythrocytes), therapeutic (235-400 pmol/8*108 erythro-cytes) and high levels correlated to myelotoxicity (> 400 pmol/8*108 erythrocytes); below 5700 pmol/8*108 eryth-rocytes and more than 5700 pmol/8*108 erythrocytes \u2013 associated with hepatotoxicity (Vikingsson et al., 2013). Measured metabolite levels correlated to the clinical re-sponse from azathioprine therapy.Conclusion A simple, sensitive, precise and accurate HPLC meth-od has been developed and validated for simultaneous de-termination of 6-TGN and 6-MMP in erythrocytes. Its main pros are: chromatographic run time less than 10 minutes (3.67 minutes for 6-TGN and 7.60 minutes for 6-MMP), facilitated pre-analytical procedure, rapid and specific de-termination of 6-MMP and 6-TGN intra-erythrocyte con-centrations. The proposed method was successfully applied to erythrocytes samples obtained from 33 patients with in-flammatory bowel disease under azathioprine therapy. The method results are in agreement with those obtained with other available methods, demonstrating its applicability for monitoring the azathioprine treatment.ReferencesDervieux, T., Boulieu, R., 1998.

These compounds include the eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, prostacyclin, leu-kotrienes, and thromboxane and the modified phospholip-ids such as platelet activating factor (PAF). Eicosanoids are synthesized from 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty arachi-donic acid, found in many cells, including activated leu-kocytes, mast cells, and platelets and therefore are widely distributed. Many inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, brady-kinin) stimulate eicosanoid production either by direct ac-tivation of PLA2, or indirectly by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, which in turn activate the enzyme. Ar-achidonic acid can be converted to these products by three different pathways: cyclooxygenase, leading to the forma-tion of prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes), li-pooxygenase, where leukotrienes and certain mono-, di- and tri-hydroxy acids are synthesized, and epoxygenase pathway, which includes cytochrome P-450 and epoxides as final products. Accordingly, cyclooxygenases, lipooxy-genases and epoxygenases are enzymes involved in these pathways (Smith, 1989). Cyclooxygenase (COX), impli-cated in cyclooxygenase pathway, exists in two forms, named COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitu-tively in different tissues, blood monocytes and platelets, and transforms arachidonic acid to prostanoids, which are involved in normal cellular homeostasis. In contrast, COX-2 may be induced by a series of pro-inflammatory stimuli and its role in the progress of inflammation, fever and pain has been known (Hawkey, 1999). Furthermore, three types of lipoxygenases, termed 5-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase are engaged in lipoxygenase pathway. Some compounds, like 12(S)-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), a product of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), has influence on the regulation of platelet aggregation, but is also found to be involved in the progression of several hu-man diseases like various cancers (Nie and Honn, 2002) psoriasis (M\u00fcller, 1994) and rheumatoid arthritis (Liagre et al., 1997). Aforementioned enzymes can be found in dif-ferent cell types. Thus, in human platelets, COX-1 and 12-LOX are the initial enzymes responsible for arachidonic acid metabolism leading to the formation of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 12-HHT (12(S)-hy-droxy-(5Z,8E,10E)-heptadecatrienoic acid) and 12-HETE. In vitro technique for evaluation of anti-inflamatory activities of natural products and plants extractsSince our research is focused on biological activity of plant extracts, we aimed to evaluate and optimize an in vi-tro assay for anti-inflammatory activity, that can be easi-ly used to determine COX-1 and 12-LOX inhibitory po-tential of plant extracts or natural products, using LC\u2013MS/MS technique for quantification of metabolites and human platelets as a source of enzymes. We used human platelets as the cell system for testing anti-inflammatory activity of numerous plant extracts and secondary metabolites. Inflammation is induced by cal-cymicin (calcium ionophore A23187) with subsequent ad-dition of Ca2+. Detailed procedure is described in our previ-ous report (Beara et al., 2010; Lesjak et al., 2013). Consid-ering quantification of formed products, our research was focused on LC\u2013MS/MS technique in order to attain high sensitive and specific method with short analysis time. Furthermore, tandem mass spectrometry provides far bet-ter sensitivity and selectivity than traditional UV detectors S3 OP 114248Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl)  247 - 248 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationsand does not depend on presence of chromophores.  The method is optimized in order to get best performance for detection of PGE2, TXB2, 12-HHT (COX-1 pathway) and 12-HETE (12-LOX pathway) products, using PGB2 as in-ternal standard.  The method performances were confirmed by measuring several parameters (Beara et al., 2010). The advantage and efficiency of this method was fur-ther confirmed through numerous subsequent studies on biological activity of natural plant products (Beara et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2014; Lesjak et al., 2011; Lesjak et al., 2013; Nadjpal et al., 2016, Simin et al., 2013). Further-more this method provides valuable information about the metabolism of arachidonic acid under inflammation. And finally, it should be noted that one of the important advan-tage of applied experiment is avoidance of undesirable in vivo tests on experimental animals.

All environmental media have naturally occur-ring mixtures of metals, and metals often are introduced into the environment as mixtures. Some of them are es-sential for maintaining proper health of humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms.Metals and inorganic requiring different approach-es for Environmental Hazard and Exposure assessments, compared to \u201ctypical organic contaminants\u201d. Several prop-erties and aspects of metals \u2013 their natural occurrence, es-sentiality, bioavailability, homeostatic control mechanisms and acclimatization to diverse natural environments, - re-quire specific recognition in the context of an environmen-tal risk assessment. The basic concept of ENV-Hazard and Risk Assessment of metals consist of four stages:\u2212\t  Classification & ranking (acute/ chronic aquatic tox-icity, transformation /dissolution, particle sizes, rank-ing systems, etc\u2026);\u2212\t Effects assessment (soil, sediment, water, data selec-tion, data handling, effects analysis, uncertainty man-agement, etc\u2026 sec. Poisoning...);\u2212\t Exposure assessment (data selection, data handling, local scenario, regional scenario, waste scenario, etc\u2026 ) and\u2212\t Risk characterization (soil sediment water sec. Poi-soning, local scenario, regional scenario, waste sce-nario, etc\u2026) (USEPA, 2007).This paper will be short introduction to challenges and key concepts specific to metals environmental assessment, through specific parts on bioavailability, effects assess-ment, and bioaccumulation.BioavailabilityBioavailability should be taken into account for hazard and risk assessment of metal compounds in order to focus on interspecies sensitivity. A tired approach can be used, ensuring that first tier assessments use effects data where bioavailability is maximized (MERAG, 2007). Knowl-edge of the chemistry of a compound will normally guide the need for the development of bioavailability correction models. Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) can be used to esti-mate bioavailability, taking into account competition from other ions and binding of metals with natural organic mat-ter. Many countries have developed frameworks for tak-ing into account metal specificities in environmental risk assessment.Bioavailability models have a specific applicability domain and have to cover soil/water parameters and back-ground relevant for the region where they are applied; in addition it may be needed to do checks with species spe-cific for that region. Further research is recommended to investigate to which extent commonalities between Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for species from different trophic levels apply amongst different metals. Further discussion is needed for developing a decision scheme as to the con-ditions for implementing BLMs in risk assessment.Effects assessmentHazard identification of metals and metal compounds is related to the toxicity of the soluble metal ions. The tox-icity of the metal ions and the release of these ions from the metal-containing substances are therefore used as a ba-sis for read-across.Effects assessments of metals could follow the follow-ing strategy: Data compilation & read-across\u2212\t Data screening for relevancy and quality\u2212\t Database developmentS3 OP 115250Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 249 - 250 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentations\u2212\t Data normalization (i.e. Bioavailability correction) Data aggregation\u2212\t Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) construction and HCX derivation if relevant PNEC derivation (in-cluding uncertainty assessment).\u2212\t Metal-specific criteria for quality and relevancy of ef-fects data to be used in the assessment should be de-veloped, taking into account criteria already developed for chemicals effect data in general (MERAG,2007).Bioaccumulation and bioconcentrationFor some metals, background can be significant (rela-tive to the PEC or PNEC) and should be integrated in the risk assessment. At the level of PEC/PNEC: the total bio-availability approach and the added risk approach could be considered; Background should be measured in unpollut-ed environments.Available data for BCFs and other Accumulation Fac-tors for metals indicate that they are inversely related to water (and sediment, and soil) concentrations. Therefore the use of a single value for assessing risks from secondary poisoning has to be considered.Measures of tissue concentrations along the food chain provide a useful way to assess secondary poisoning.Further discussion is needed as to how to improve comparisons/interpretations of BCFs and BAFs for metals to regulatory threshold values.For the assessment of secondary poisoning, a tiered approach should be used, taking into account: dietary com-position for consumer organisms, high BCF values could be used as a trigger to perform more detailed assessments, relevant food chains should drive the selection of BAFs and oral PNEC values, bioavailability of the metal in the food or incidentally ingested soil/sediment and the water concentration used in BCF or BAF experiments should preferably be in the same range as the PEC.ConclusionPresented key guiding principles is based on the unique attributes of metals. Metal speciation affects met-al behavior in environmental media. PH and redox poten-tial affect speciation. Kd values \u2013 a coefficient for mobili-ty in soils limited use of single values. Aging of metals in media reduces bioavailability. Metal sorption behavior af-fects bioavailability.The aim of this paper is describe how metals-specific attributes and principles may be applied in the context of existing risk assessment guidance and in existing human health and ecological risk assessment practices.ReferencesMERAG fact sheets: 03,07,08, 2007.

The toxicity of dimethoate results in deleterious effects caus-ing oxidative stress on many organs and systems in human and animals particularly the kidney, liver, testes, brain, ner-vous, and reproductive system (Abou-Baker et al., 2014). The cellular antioxidant defense is reinforced by the pres-ence of dietary antioxidants. Accordingly, there has been recently growing interest in the role and usage of natural antioxidants as a strategy to prevent oxidative damage in various health problems (Saafi et al., 2011).Laurocerasus officinalis Roem. is known as \u201ccher-ry laurel\u201d in English. L. officinalis is grown as a native fruit crop locally called \u201ctaflan, lazkiraz\u0131, karayemi\u015f\u201don the coasts of the Black Sea region of Turkey (Erdogan-Orhan and K\u00fcpeli-Akkol, 2011). The fruits and seeds of the L. officinalis are widely utilized as herbal medicine in Turkey for the treatment of stomach ulcers, digestive sys-tem problems, bronchitis (seeds), eczemas, hemorrhoids, anti-diabetic (seeds), analgesic on local pain, and as a di-uretic (fruits) (Ayaz  et al., 1998; Elmastas et al., 2013; K\u00fcpeli-Akkol et al., 2012; \u015eenayl\u0131 et al., 2012; Yaylac\u0131-Karahalil and \u015eahin, 2011). By in vitro models  a neuropro-tective effect of the fruits of L. officinalis was found (Er-dogan-Orhan and K\u00fcpeli-Akkol, 2011). In vivo experimen-tal study determined the anti-inflammatory effects of L. of-ficinalis leaves (K\u00fcpeli-Akkol, 2012). L. officinalis fruit is rich in phenolics and a good source of natural antioxidant protecting humans from several diseases caused by oxida-tive stress (Yaylac\u0131-Karahalil and \u015eahin, 2011). The aim of the study was to determine the nephrotoxic effects of dimethoate on biochemical indicators of kidney function tests, oxidative stress parameters, and histological examination in rats and the protective/ameliorative effects of L. officinalis fruit extract. Materials and methods60 male Wistar albino rats were divided into six ex-perimental groups of 10 rats each and were treated daily by oral gavage for 60 days. Group I (control group) re-ceived only saline (0.9% NaCl); Group II was treated with dimethoate; Group III was given fruit extract; Group IV was treated with fruit extract and dimethoate; Group V was treated with vitamin C and dimethoate; Group VI was ad-ministrated only dimethoate for the first month. During the second month, the rats were treated with dimethoate and fruit extract. Dimethoate, L. officinalis fruit extract, and vitamin C were applied at 7, 4, and 100 mg/kg/day dos-es, respectively. At the end of the 60 days, rats were an-aesthetized by ketamine and xylazine. Blood samples were taken from hearts to the sterile tubes and centrifugated at 3500 rpm for 20 min to separate serum. The serum sam-ples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis of blood urea ni-trogen (BUN) andcreatine. The kidneys were removed im-mediately and washed with sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). They are divided into two sections. One section was S3 OP 116252Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 251 - 252 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationsplaced in formaldehyde solution for routine histopatholog-ic examination by light microscopy. The other half of kid-ney tissue section was homogenized in ten volumes of ice-cold 140 mMKCl and Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.6) us-ing a homogenizer for 2 min at 13.000 rpm. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) for lipid peroxidation index were determined in the tissue homogenates by using spectropho-tometer. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 5000 g for 60 min to remove debris. Clear supernatant was used for superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glu-tathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activity assays. Results and discussionIn comparison to the control group, a statistically significant increase was observed in the serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatine in dimethote treat-ed group (p<0.05). However, administration of L. offici-nalis to dimethoate treated groups (group IV and VI) pro-vided a markedly reduction in levels of BUN and creatine (p<0.05). Moreover, vitamin C treated rats to dimethoate treated group showed  decreased BUN and creatine lev-els (p<0.05).Treatment with dimethoate caused an increase in the kidney tissue levels of MDA as compared with the control group (p<0.05). However, treatment with L. officinalis to dimethoate treated groups (group IV and VI) provided a re-duction in MDA levels compared to the dimethoate treated group (p<0.05). The antioxidant enzymes activities of SOD and GPx in the group of only dimethote treated rats were significantly lower than those in the control group. Howev-er, L. officinalis treatment resulted in a significant increase of SOD and GPx activities (p<0.05). The activity of CAT enzyme was markedly decreased in dimethoate treated rats and elevated in L. officinalis treated rats as compared to control rats, but this effect was not statistically significant.The kidneys of the control group showed normal kid-ney parenchym. With light microscopic examinations, his-topathological changes such as mononuclear cell infiltra-tion, glomerular atrophy, congestion and necrosis in the kidney tissues were observed in the dimethoate treated group as compared with control group. Administration of L. officinalis apparently reduced kidney tissue damage. On the other hand, there were not any differences in histologic appearance of kidneys between the control and L. officina-lis treated group. Also, the kidney morphology in vitamin C treated group was similar to that of the control group.The antioxidants may play a major role in the preven-tion of diseases related to oxidative stress. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the research of antioxidant com-pounds such as phenolics present in the plants (Erdogan-Orhan and K\u00fcpeli-Akkol, 2011). These phenolics provide protection against toxic radicals due to their radical scav-enger activities and have therapeutically beneficial effects on human health (Yaylac\u0131-Karahaliland \u015eahin, 2011). It was found that L. officinalis fruit extract has strong radi-cal scavenging activity and antioxidant effects  (Erdogan-Orhan and K\u00fcpeli-Akkol, 2011; Kolayl\u0131 et al., 2003). ConclusionIn conclusion, dimethoate exposure indicated the dis-ruption of nephrotic architecture in kidney section as com-pared to control group. We observed that L. officinalis fruit extract pre- and post- administration to dimethoate treated rats significantly reduced kidney injury by preventing oxi-dative damage. Therefore, L. officinalis fruit may be useful for the prevention of oxidative stress-induced kidney injury.This research was financially supported by Research Fund of the Erciyes University Scientific Research Project Unit (Project number: TCD-2013-4127).ReferencesAbou-Baker, S., Assem, A.K., Sherif, R.M., Eldesouky, T.A. 2014.

In respect to probiotic foods both the viability of the probiotic within foods and bioavailability within the host has to be studied (Figueroa-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2011), while at least maintaining the quality of conventional prod-uct used as a carrier. Microencapsulation may offer good protection of probiotic viability loss during manufacture, product storage and after ingestion of probiotics, especial-ly during exposure to unfavorable GI conditions (S\u00e1nchez et al., 2012).The aim of the study was to obtain a functional prod-uct ayran with therapeutic level of viable and metabolic ac-tive cells of L. casei 01 (a minimum of 107 log CFU per mL ayran). Quality of the prepared probiotic and synbiotic samples was examined as well as their therapeutic benefits in animal model with chemically induced colitis.Materials and methodsAyran samples were prepared by fortifying commer-cially available product (Ayran, Zdravje, Macedonia) with non-encapsulated probiotic L. casei 01 (Chr. Hansen, Den-mark) and/or prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (Syn-ergy 1, Orafti-Rue L. Mar\u00e9chal, Belgium) and encapsulat-ed synbiotic. Synbiotic microparticles were produced when an overnight activated culture in MRS broth (37 \u00b0C, 24 h) with a cell load ca. 11-12 log CFU/mL in a mixture with 4% w/w alginate (Protanal LF 10/60 LS, fG 35-45%, FMC BioPolymer, IMCD, UK) and prebiotic (1.5% w/w) was infused to the spray-dryer (B\u00fcchi Mini Spray Dryer B-290, SW). Spray-drying was performed at inlet and outlet tem-perature of 120 \u00b0C and 58\u00b13 \u00b0C, respectively, flow rate 6 ml/min, nozzle diameter 0.7 mm, aspirator pressure 90% and atomizer pressure 600 Nlh-1. Polyelectrolyte com-plexation/cross-linking of the dried powders was done un-der continuous stirring for at least 3 h with 0.5% w/w chi-tosan (Chitine, France) and 5% w/w CaCl2 (Merck, Ger-many) dissolved in 1% v/v acetic acid. The hardened mi-croparticles were freeze-dried (-50 \u00b0C, 0.070 mbar, 24 h) (FreeZone Freeze Dry System, Labconco, USA) (Petres-ka Ivanovska et al., 2014). Analyses of the quality of ayran samples include determination of protein, fat and carbohy-drate content of the ayran by Bradford, Gerber and phenol-sulphuric acid methods, respectively, while the total solids were determined using gravimetric method. Titration acid-ity (lactic acid,%) and pH measurements were also eval-uated. AAS and HPLC was applied to quantify minerals and organic acid production, respectively. Then, to female Wistar rats (n=6, 180-250 g, 10-14 weeks old), function-al ayran samples (8.5-8.9 log CFU/mL of the food prod-uct) were administered orally, once and twice daily. Plain ayran and drinking water were given to positive controls. Two weeks after starting the experiment, the rats were fast-ed overnight and those from the positive controls and treat-ed groups were rendered colitic. Colitis was induced intra-rectally at 8 cm proximal to the anus using TNBS (trinitro-benzenesulfonic acid) dissolved in 50% ethanol at a dose 10 and 30 mg/kg. After 6 days of continued treatment the S3 OP 117254Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 253 - 254 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationsrats were sacrificed. Negative controls treated with 0.9% NaCl were also included in the protocol. The anti-inflam-matory effects of functional ayran samples were evaluated in respect to the clinical activity/total damage score (quan-tified by loss on weight, consistency of feces and rectal bleeding), macroscopic and histopathological changes, co-lon weight/colon length and colon weight/body weight ra-tios, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity.Results and discussionAt the day of preparation, probiotic counts of 9.43, 9.7 and 9.58 log CFU/mL were determined in ayran enriched with non-encapsulated probiotic and synbiotic, and encap-sulated synbiotic, respectively. Viability loss during the shelf-life of the product was significant with viable level above the therapeutic minimum in ayran containing encap-sulated synbiotic of 8.22 log CFU/mL. Total solids in the ayran samples fortified with probiotic, synbiotic and synbi-otic microparticles were moderately increased due to add-ed dry matters with no negative effect on the texture or sen-sory properties of the product. Significant differences of acidity and pH values were not detected between the sam-ples, which showed no excess of acidity when probiotic was added. The content of proteins and fats in ayran sam-ples was in accordance with the required levels (2.8 and 1 g per 100 mL of product, respectively) during the shelf-life of 15 days at 4 \u00b0C. Analyses of carbohydrates have shown increased content in samples containing non-encapsulated and encapsulated synbiotic due to the carbohydrate nature of the prebiotic, with the latter to be more significant. No significant difference for sodium content in prepared sam-ples were observed compared to the plain ayran, while po-tassium and calcium content differed significantly among the samples with decreasing trend probably due to the abil-ity of probiotic bacteria to use these minerals as nutrient sources. Exception was observed with the increased calci-um content in the sample containing synbiotic microparti-cles which were prepared using calcium as a cross-linking agent. Increased metabolic activity of the probiotic was ob-served in ayran containing encapsulated synbiotic due to the higher production of lactic and acetic acid up to 81.83 mmol/L and 79.93 mmol/L, respectively. Low quantity of propionic acid (12.15-15.03 mmol/L) was determined in functional ayran samples only, but no butyric acid was de-tected.In rats with induced colitis using 10 mg/kg TNBS, most significant reduction of parameters of inflammation was found in group treated by ayran containing encapsu-lated synbiotic. Microscopic assessment have shown ul-cerations on mucosa and sub-mucosa, accompanied by ex-tensive inflammatory infiltrate and congested blood ves-sels, in groups receiving plain ayran or drinking water. In the groups treated with ayran containing non-encapsulat-ed probiotic/synbiotic visible segments of ulcerations and subepithelial polymorph nuclear infiltration were found, while higher integrity of mucosal architecture of colon tis-sue was seen in group treated with ayran enriched by en-capsulated synbiotic. Hence, when colitis was induced us-ing 30 mg/kg TNBS, sample containing encapsulated syn-biotic was administered. The lowest value of MPO activi-ty was observed when ayran with microparticulated synbi-otic was given twice daily, but parameters of inflammation were not significantly different between groups adminis-tered once and twice daily. Dilated blood vessels in submu-cosal layer as well dilated intestinal glands were observed in the rats treated by ayran with microencapsulated synbi-otic, regardless of the frequency of administration. These findings indicate that a single administration of ayran en-riched by microencapsulated formulation successfully pro-tect the viability of the probiotic through the upper GIT and ensure prolonged residence time of viable cells in the lower intestinum with no necessity to increase the frequen-cy of usage.ConclusionFunctional samples with maintained quality of the product ayran within its shelf-life were developed, while the ayran containing synbiotic microparticles has the ad-vantage of increased probiotic viability and better profile of the bacterial metabolism end products known to main-tain morphologic and functional integrity of colonic epi-thelium. Ayran enriched by microencapsulated synbiotic administered once a day provided efficient anti-inflamma-tory activity due to adhesive properties of the microparti-cles and their favorable interaction with the ayran as me-dium, thus showing potential to be used as adjuvant ther-apy in IBD.ReferencesFigueroa-Gonz\u00e1lez, I., Quijano, G., Ram\u00edrez, G., Cruz-Guerrero, A., 2011.

Health claims are defined as \u2018any claim that states, suggests or implies that a relationship ex-ists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health\u201d (Reg. 1924/2006), currently the list of permitted health claims made on food in EU, is established by Com-mission Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 (Reg.432/2012).Meanwhile, defined by the congress of Dietary Sup-plement Health and Education Act (DSHEA, 1994), sim-ilarly with the Directive 2002/46/EC (2002), a \u201cdietary supplement\u201d is a product containing a \u201cdietary ingredi-ent\u201d intended to supplement the diet. According to FDA \u2013 DSHEA (1994) these products are not subject to pre-market safety evaluations, allowing for products labeling claims as long as it does not diagnose, prevent, treat or cure a specific disease.Amino acidsAmino acids are big part of cells, muscle and tissue, this way carrying out a big role in many body functions, cells structure, transport and storage of nutritious. Ami-no acids have been object of many scientific studies and there are many ongoing studies, consequently research over years claim for the possibility of useful of amino acids against osteoporosis, diabetes, heart trouble, metabolic dis-orders, erectile dysfunction, menopausal complaints etc.This paper presents a literature review of health claims on the current state of the health claims of amino acids as dietary ingredient of dietary supplements in general, focus-ing in amino acids, such as: Arginine (conditionally essen-tial amino acid in humans); Glutamine (non-essential and conditionally essential in humans); Lysine (an essential amino acid in humans).Arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide, an endoge-nous messenger molecule involved in a variety of endo-thelium-mediated physic ological effects in the vascular system. Generally speaking, is involved in many metabol-ic processes and many studies so far argue for its impor-tance in heart disease and high blood pressure, improve-ment of circulation, strengthening of immune system and a positive influence on male libido. Arginine supplementa-tion is considered safe, but people with renal failure or he-patic disease may be unable to appropriately metabolize and excrete supplemental arginine, this way they should be monitored. According to Scientific opinion of EFSA Pan-el on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) for Health Claims of L-arginine (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2015) the claimed effects \u201cerection\u201d, \u201csupporting spermatogene-sis\u201d, effect \u201cvascular system\u201d, \u201cnormal blood pressure\u201d are considered of a beneficial physiological effect and L-argi-nine itself is considered to be sufficiently characterized but there is no cause-effect relationship established apart from the role of arginine contributing to protein synthesis.Glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid in human blood. Glutamine is important as a constituent of proteins, means of nitrogen transport between tissues, im-portant in acid base regulation, gluconeogenesis, as a pre-cursor of nucleotide bases and the antioxidant glutathi-one. Also glutamine is considered important in prolifera-tion of lymphocytes and other rapidly dividing cell, includ-S3 OP 118256Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 255 - 256 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationsing the gut mucosa and bone marrow stem cells. Many re-searchers suggest that glutamine may provide benefit for surgery, trauma, help support digestive system health af-ter periods of physical stress, wound healing, helps sup-port immune system health after periods of physical stress, helps to assist in muscle cell repair after exercise, cancer and bone marrow transplantation and it`s administration is well tolerated. Meanwhile, according to Scientific opin-ion of EFSA - NDA for Health Claims of glutamine such as \u201cimmune health\u201d and \u201cintestinal health\u201d are considered of a beneficial physiological effect (EFSA FEEDAP Pan-el, 2015) and health claim referees to faster restoration of glycogen stores in skeletal muscle after strenuous exercise, \u201cincreasing cell swelling, volumization\u201d, \u201cmuscle protein metabolism\u201d and \u201cimproves muscles metabolism\u201d (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2015) are considered of a beneficial phys-iological effect but based on scientific data the Panel con-cludes the relationship of cause and efficacy of the above claimed effects has not been established.Lysine is converted to acetyl CoA, a critical compo-nent in carbohydrate metabolism and the production of en-ergy. Lysine is precursor of the carnitine, which is transport-ing long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production. According to studies, supplemental L-lysine has putative anti-herpes simplex virus activity, also because ly-sine seems to have an antagonist effect with arginine, which is required for the replication of HSV. However, according to Scientific opinion of EFSA (EFSA FEEDAP Panel, 2015) for Health Claim of L-lysine maintenance of bone is con-sidered of a beneficial physiological effect and other health claims such as \u201cimmune defense against herpes virus\u201d, \u201cmaintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol concentra-tions\u201d, \u201cincrease in appetite leading to an increase in energy intake\u201d, \u201ccontribution to normal protein synthesis\u201d might be of a beneficial physiological effect but no cause and effect relationship has not been established. Studies have shown that L-lysine can contribute to a positive Ca balance, sug-gesting a potential use of L-lysine supplements for preven-tive and therapeutic intervention in osteoporosis.ConclusionGenerally speaking, food supplements can be benefi-cial to the health of consumers, but based on a general re-view any health claim of food should be scientifically jus-tified toward protection of people from any bed interpreta-tion and information.But still, a part of all the studies and researches, ami-no acids still don`t take their credit yet and are not properly recognized in medical sciences in Europe, since the health claims of food containing amino acids are still considered to be not established in terms of cause and effect relation-ship. Therefore, analyzing all the publications in this di-rection, the faster this process goes, the greater will be the chances for health benefits amongst population in relation to amino acids uses.As it is well said by the Millward: \u201cFew issues in nutri-tional science have aroused such long-standing and deep-seated controversies as protein and amino acid require-ments?\u201d (Millward et al., 1997).ReferencesCommission regulation (EU) No 432/2012, 2012.

Macedonia* darinka.gorgieva@ugd.edu.mkIntroductionAntibody conjugates are therapeutics that function through mediating alterations in antigen or receptor func-tion, modulating the immune system (for example, changing Fc function and T cell activation) or delivering of a specif-ic drug conjugated to antibody that targets a specific antigen (Scott et al., 2012; Weiner et al., 2010). Four main classes using antibodies are investigated to target cytotoxic agents to cancer cells: antibody-protein toxin conjugates, antibody-chelated radionuclide conjugates, antibody\u2013small-molecule drug conjugates, and antibody-enzyme conjugates (admin-istered together with small-molecule prodrugs) (Teicher and Chari, 2011). Only antibody-radionuclide conjugates and antibody-drug conjugates have reached the regulatory ap-proval stage. Radio immunotherapy, exploits the specifici-ty of an antibody to deliver a radionuclide, and affords some potential benefits over conventional radiotherapy. Antibody-radionuclide conjugates have been successfully developed for the treatment of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL), re-sulting in the approval of 131I-tositumomab (Bexxar) and 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin), which are CD20-tar-geted agents (Maloney et al., 2010). Important steps that are necessary to transform monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in drugs for human use must be followed to achieve success in treatment of cancer patients with antibodies. Furthermore, dealing with the challenges in the process of target selection and selection of conjugate elements including the design of antibody formulation is also imperative. Development and evaluation of antibody conjugatesThe successful development of candidate antibodies involves complex evaluations, concerning cancer biology and the properties of antibodies in vivo. Essential preclin-ical characterization includes identification of the physical and chemical properties of the antibody; detailed analysis of antigen expression using normal and malignant tissues; study of the immune effector functions and signaling path-way effects of the antibody; toxicity assessment; analysis of in vivo antibody localization and distribution in tumor systems; and observation of the in vivo therapeutic activity of the antibody, alone or conjugated with radioactive iso-topes or other drugs.In case of NHLs, the biodistribution studies of a radio-conjugate in the tumor tissue and an assessment of whole-body toxicity and dosimetry were essential in preclinical trials leading to approval of CD20 specific radioimmuno-conjugates tositumomab and ibritumomab for treatment by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (de Bono and Ashworth, 2010). Rituximab also has considerable suc-cess in treatment of patients with CD20 positive NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Radioimmunotherapy with rituximab labeled with suitable radioisotopes, is new op-portunity after promising preliminary results where pre-clinical data demonstrated improved tumor response (Scott et al., 2012). Toxicity studiesOne of the most essential steps in the evaluation of a potential diagnostic/therapeutic antibody is determination of the toxicity of an antibody (often radiolabelled) and the ratio of antibody uptake in the tumor versus normal tissues. This information is essential for the rational design of an-tibody conjugates therapy, where uptake of antibodies by normal tissues is crucial for predicting toxicity on one side, but also is crucial for defining dose regimen where optimal tumor concentration of the antibodies will be achieved on the other. S3 OP 119258Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 257 - 258 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationsNormal and tumor tissue distribution can be quanti-fied and evaluated by toxicity studies in animal models, where kinetics, distribution and induced effects in mice/rats or other nonrodent species, with or without implanted tumor are followed.  These studies include administration of selected doses of radiolabelled mAbs and monitoring of tumor growth or survival of animals over time (Reilly et al., 2006). A control group of animals receives only the sol-vent of the formulation or non-specific radiolabelled mAbs of the same class. Generalized and gastrointestinal toxici-ty is followed by the weight monitoring (significant weight loss > 10-20%), while bone marrow toxicity is assessed by hematology analyses including leukocyte (WBC), erythro-cyte (RBC), and platelet counts as well as hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations. Biochemistry anal-yses included serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for liver toxicity and creatinine (Cr) levels for renal toxicity. In addition, samples from different tissues (liver, kidneys, etc) are obtained for hystopatological examination by light or electron microscopy. Potential radiotherapeutic agent should demonstrate specific anti-tumor effects targeted only tumor tissue with only minimal to moderate toxici-ty to normal tissues. ConclusionsVaried and newly designed antibody conjugates are currently directed toward various tumor targets in clinical trials, and more are nearing clinical trial. Before reaching any possibility for patient\u2019s treatment, successfully passed preclinical phase is essential. The future development of antibody conjugates as therapeutics in cancer treatment is dependent on data from laboratory studies, on applying in-novative approaches to target and antibody selection and on appropriate development strategies, leading at the end, to clinical benefit in cancer patients.Referencesde Bono, J.

In the field of environmental toxicology, the animals, also, play important roles in establishing the degree of tox-icity of the potential toxic agents. In the scientific research the mice are preferred as ani-mal models. The strain of mice is chosen by respecting dif-ferent conditions, such as: the type of experiment that will be performed, the susceptibility of the mice to develop the pathology or the signs specifics to the model desired, the mouse genetics, the lifespan and other factors experiment-related.The Cosorb process is known as the process used for the recovery of carbon monoxide (CO) from gas mixtures. This method requires an equimolar amount of CuCl and AlCl3 that will be added to an excess of toluene and the re-sult will be the formation of a CuAlCl4-toluene complex that is capable to fix CO (Foster, 2007). The objective of this study was to evaluate the pro-in-flammatory effect of the organic phase resulted during the Cosorb process by the means of ear-inflammation mouse model using 3 different strains of mice: Balb/c, SKH-1 and C57BL/6J mice. Materials and methodsFor this experiment there were used male Balb/c, SKH-1 and C57BL/6J mice weighing between 23-35g, purchased from Charles River Labs, Budapest, Hungary and housed in standard conditions in the Animal house Fa-cility from our University.The organic phase composition consists of the follow-ing aromatic volatile compounds: toluene (84.46%), xy-lems (5.3%) and benzene (0.1%). The ear-inflammation mouse model protocol proposed in this study was per-formed as described in the literature (Dkhil et al., 2010; Iyadomi et al, 2000) with several modifications. In brief, different volumes of the organic phase (20, 40 and 80 \u00b5l) were applied using a micro-pipette on the skin of the front and back of the right ear and the left ear was untreated in order to be used as control. The ear swelling was monitored for 24h post-application and at different time points: 2h, 4h, 8h and 24h were taken photos and the mice were weighed. At every time point mentioned, the mice were sacrificed under anesthesia and the both ears were cut off, sized and weighed. The increase in ear\u2019s weight determined by the organic phase application which represents the intensity of ear edema was calculated by subtracting the weight of the treated ear from that of the left ear, untreated, used as con-trol (Dkhil et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011).Samples from control and treated ears of mice were collected and fixed in formalin solution for histopathologi-cal analysis. The samples will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed. S3 OP 120260Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 259 - 260 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationsResults and discussionThe aim of our study was to evaluate the pro-inflam-matory effects of the compounds found in the organic phase: toluene, xylene and benzene as a mixture of organic solvents by using animal models of ear inflammation. We decided to use three different strains of mice (Balb/c, SKH-1 and C57Bl/6J mice) to verify if the species variability in-fluences the effects of these compounds at skin level.Our data indicated the presence of erythema, swelling and edema, first signs being observable earlier than 2 hours post-application of the organic phase in all three strains of mice. The weights of the right ears treated with the organ-ic phase solution were bigger as compared to the left ears untreated used as controls, a marker of ear edema intensity. The capacity of inducing ear edema was dose dependent, the intensity of the effects being higher at the highest vol-umes added.   In a previous study, we showed that topical applica-tion of organic and inorganic phases induced modifications in the physiological cutaneous parameters (hydration, tran-sepidermal waterloss and erythema) in a hairless SKH-1 mouse model (Coricovac et al., 2015; Simu et al., 2016). The use of xylene as an inducer of ear edema mouse model was associated with acute inflammation character-ized by severe vasodilation, edematous changes at skin level and infiltration of inflammatory cells (Igbe et al., 2010). Another signs of xylene toxicity at skin level after topical application were: increased vascular permeability, swelling within the dermis and proliferation of keratino-cytes (Dkhil et al., 2010). Iyadomi and coworkers showed that application of toluene to the ear skin of Balb/c mice induced ear swelling and skin irritancy in a dose depen-dent manner (Iyadomi et al., 2000). Similar results were observed in our study, too.Toluene is an aromatic organic solvent known as an environmental toxicant. Inhalation of toluene was associat-ed with airway inflammation and neurotrophin production in hippocampus of mice. Benzene and xylene induce irri-tation of the airway and dizziness in humans. Volatile or-ganic compounds as toluene, benzene and xylene were de-scribed as substances able to determine inflammatory re-sponses at pulmonary level, but also to modulate neurolog-ical responses in brain (Wang et al., 2012).According to the literature, Balb/c mice are suscepti-ble to develop tumors, like mammary and colon cancer, to infection diseases and as animal models for ear edema studies by the dermal application of different inflammatory agents (Chen et al., 2005; Iyadomi et al., 2000).SKH-1 hairless mice are a strain used very often in studies concerning the development of skin cancers and, in pathologies involving skin changes, due to the fact that the lack of hair offers a better observation of the changes that occur.ConclusionOur preliminary data indicate that the application of the organic solvents mixture induced ear inflammation in all three strains of mice used in the study. The information obtained in the present study is valuable, especially from the point of toxicity that might develop by the workers in the industry of CO recovery and, in addition, this mixture could be used as an agent for animal model of ear edema in order to test the anti-inflammatory effects of different compounds.AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by the PN-II-PT-PC-CA-2013-4-0612 grant, nr. 110/2014 (REMACAT).ReferencesDkil, M.A., Abdel-Baki, A.S., Al-Quirashi, S.,Al-Khalifa, M., 2010.

Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* blagicajovanova@hotmail.comROS and antioxidant defense In the past 20 years numerous achievements were made in the area of testing the cellular damage caused by the excessive production of free radicals. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are strongly related with the onset of dis-eases such as cancers, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, diabe-tes, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, idiopathic pulmo-nary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.ROS are produced from molecular oxygen as a result of the normal cellular metabolism in living organisms or as a result of environmental factors. The three major types of ROS that are of physiological significance are superox-ide anion, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide. They are essential for the physiological signaling pathways and other cell processes. However, these highly reactive mol-ecules, if present at high concentrations, damage the cell structures (such as lipids, proteins, nucleic acids) and al-ter their functions. The disbalance between the oxidant and antioxidant effects inside a viable cell in favor of the oxi-dants is described with the term \u201coxidative stress\u201d. Oxida-tive stress occurs when the balance between antioxidants and ROS is disrupted because of either depletion of anti-oxidants or accumulation of ROS. Consequently, high con-centrations of ROS result in a higher degree of oxidative stress leading to many pathological conditions.Aerobic organisms have integrated antioxidant sys-tems that are usually effective in blocking the harmful ef-fects of ROS. If present in small quantities, antioxidants are powerful agents that can prevent or reduce the oxida-tive destruction of biomolecules. Generally, antioxidants can be divided in two categories: enzymatic and nonen-zymatic. The major enzymatic antioxidants are superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin, glutathione transferase. Nonenzymatic an-tioxidants include vitamins C and E, \u03b2-carotene, uric acid, and glutathione. However, in pathological conditions, the antioxidant systems can be overwhelmed, causing disbal-ance of ROS/antioxidant index. Consequently, additional source of antioxidants is essential, to enhance the metabo-lism against the excess of free radicals.Natural sources of antioxidantsBeside the many benefits of the plant utilization for different reasons, herbs have been identified as sources of various phytochemicals, many of which cause antioxidant effects. For a very long time, herbs were the only medici-nal therapy that people used in the treatment of various dis-eases. Although synthetic drugs were developed in the 19th century and replaced herbal therapy in many fields of treat-ment, herbs are still found in 40% of prescription drugs. Additionally, herbs are also used in the cosmetics industry, food industry and chemical industry. Herbs and spices are reliable sources of potential bio-active compounds in human diet. Research indicates that these bioactive components may act alone or in combina-tion with other bioactive moieties to reduce disease risk through their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antirheu-matic, hepatoprotective, antimutagenic, and anticancer ac-tivities. They are rich in phytochemicals that are natural antioxidants, of which phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, fla-vanols, alkaloids, tannins and phenolic acids are the most prominent. Compared to other food products, herbs and spices used in diet are shown to manifest highest antiox-idant capacity. Additionally, the antioxidant capacity has shown to be concentration dependent, to a degree where the naturally occurring phytochemicals with antioxida-S3 OP 121262Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 261 - 262 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationstive properties are not manifesting their prooxidative ef-fects. These results are of great importance in many re-search areas especially for the possibility of isolation of single compounds and their utilization in medicinal pur-poses (Charles, 2013).In many research papers it is pointed out that the in-take of herbs is a significant contributor to the antioxidant intake in general. Dragland et al. (2003) declare a 1000-fold difference among antioxidant concentrations of vari-ous herbs, indicating the enormous diversity of their phyto-chemical composition. Furthermore, they recommend the use of herbs as a better source of dietary antioxidants than many other foods including fruits, berries, cereals and veg-etables.Quantification of the antioxidant capacity Many commercially available herbs are regularly used as teas, extracts, infuses, decocts or aromatic herbs for taste improvement of food. Therefore, their antioxidant prop-erties are already affecting the population that consumes them. The quantification of their antioxidant potential is very important, in order to evaluate their impact on the re-dox processes in the organisms. Various methods are used to investigate the antioxidant properties of plant samples. In general, antioxidant assays are classified as in vitro and in vivo methods, with a highlight on the first group of tests since they are relatively straightforward to perform and most of them are fast and inexpensive, compared to in vivo methods. Among the in vitro methods, the most common-ly used are DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) method, FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) assay, TRAP (Total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter) method, TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) method, NRD and SRD (Nonsite Specific and Site Specific Hydrox-yl Radical-mediated 2-deoxy-D-ribose Degradation) meth-ods, TBA (Thiobarbituric acid) method, H2O2 (Hydrogen Peroxide Scavenging) assay, etc. Additionally, Folin \u2013 Ci-ocalteu method for the determination of total phenols and AlCl3 method for the determination of flavonoids in plant samples are most commonly used assays along with the previously mentioned antioxidant assays, since many stud-ies showed the positive correlation between antioxidant ca-pacity of plant extracts and their total phenolic content. Cytotoxicity testing On the other hand, many herbs that possess antioxi-dant properties can also manifest toxic effects under cer-tain conditions. According to Paracelsus\u2019 maxim: \u201cDosis sola facit venenum\u201d (The dose makes a substance poison-ous), any substance could be defined as a toxic substance if administered in high doses. An excellent in vivo prelim-inary model for the discovery of potential toxic agents is the Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay (BSLA). This is a conve-nient, fast and technically feasible method for the determi-nation of LC50 of herbal extracts (Meyer et al., 1982). The method determines the percentage of dead Artemia salina nauplii after their exposure to the tested plant extract. Us-ing probit regression analysis (Finney, 1952), the LC50 val-ues are calculated and expressed for each herbal extract, which are later compared to the LC50 values of confirmed toxic substances (such as potassium dichromate, emetine hydrochloride etc). The classification of the examined plant extracts is achieved according to the obtained LC50 using different classification scales, of which the Meyer\u2019s scale (Meyer et al., 1982) and the Clarkson\u2019s scale (Clark-son et al., 2004) are most commonly used.Plant extracts as cytotoxic agentsMany herbs which have proven toxic potential in cer-tain doses, are promising cytotoxic agents. Their wide range of properties (antioxidant, antimicrobial, hepatopro-tective, anticancer) makes them promising candidates for a formulation of chemo protective agents. This means a new opportunity for the clinical practice for the treatment of nu-merous diseases, either in a way of preventing their onset or reducing the extent of their progression. However, not all toxic substances possess cytotoxic properties. The pre-condition for a cytotoxic effect is the selectivity towards the tumorigenic cells of the substance itself. Therefore, po-tential cytotoxic agents are the compounds which specifi-cally act on cancer cells, leaving out viable cells as intact. Although BSLA cannot estimatethe cell selectivity of the potential toxic herbs, it is still an excellent predictive tool that preliminary filters the potential candidates for a more detailed cytotoxicity research.

Shift from malnutrition and infectious diseases to chronic diseases (cardio metabolic diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus) is typical for current epidemiological situation (Rie\u010dansk\u00fd, 2009). Obesity leads to a worse quality of life and short-er life expectancy. Mortality of cardio metabolic diseas-es is 2.5 times higher than the average in European coun-tries. This current epidemiological situation in overweight and obesity is alarming. Compulsory school physical ed-ucation is the only place for physical activity for a lot of children. And the number of these children is increasing. The research is based on project \u201cRespect for Health\u201d. We analysed the relationship between participation in com-pulsory PE and cardio metabolic risk factors (blood pres-sure, weight and body mass index). The project \u201cRespect For Health\u201d is monitoring the situation in the cardiovascu-lar health of secondary school students. Assessment of car-diovascular risk factors and physical activity (compulsory physical education (PE) and extra-curriculum sport activi-ties) in secondary school children is followed by education in effective lifestyle measures.Materials and methodsTarget group in evaluating the relationship of partic-ipation in compulsory school physical education and risk factors for cardio metabolic diseases consisted of 760 stu-dents of which 295 boys and 465 girls. In respect of par-ticipation in extra-curricular sports activity and selected risk factors consisted of audience of 211 pupils, 119 boys and 92 girls from 55 secondary schools in Bratislava re-gion aged 15-18. Data were collected by 2 types of ques-tionnaire (questionnaire of parent and questionnaire of stu-dent). We measured anthropometric parameters (neckline, chestline and hipline), blood pressure and tested physical ability by Ruffier test.Project: \u201cRespect for Health\u201d monitoring the situation in the cardiovascular health of secondary school students. The project was initiated by Bratislava Region in collabo-ration with the Regional Public Health Institute in Bratisla-va. The main idea of the project is based on the recogni-tion that risk factors for cardiovascular diseases can oc-cur at a young age. Elimination of a risk is possible thanks to prevention and change of eating habits. The project was implemented by the Regional Institute of Public Health in Bratislava with Public Health students of Slovak Medical University.Results and discussionFor evaluation of the relationship of participation in compulsory school physical education and risk factors for cardio metabolic disease, we found out that students who regularly attend compulsory PE are more physically profi-cient than those who avoid it according to the Ruffier in-dex. Students who spend more hours per a day at the com-puter during the week are physically less proficient than those who spend fewer hours at the computer during the week, according to the Ruffier index. All these relations were statistically significant (p <0.05). We found out that smoking students avoid compulsory PE twice as much as non-smokers. The current problem is smoking in young children and the number of smokers in young age are mul-S3 OP 122264Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 263 - 264  (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationstiple (Cvopov\u00e1 et al., 2011). The number of smoking girls is 1.2 times higher than the number of smoking boys. This is really a good example of how one negative habit picks on another and they multiply. For other indicators, a statis-tically significant difference was not confirmed, but more favourable results in blood pressure, weight and body mass index (BMI) were shown for regularly participating stu-dents at the compulsory PE. In respect of participation in extra-curricular sports activity and selected risk factors, we confirmed that the active Ruffiers\u00b4 test of sport active chil-dren testified better shape of these students (p = 0.048). We also demonstrated a statistically significant relationship be-tween regular supply of food and BMI values (p = 0016). Extra -curricular sports activity leads to better fit children. Regular diet directly affects BMI. Because of physical ac-tivity they feel their life filled with experiences and activ-ities.ConclusionLack of physical activity is one of the major risk fac-tors of cardio metabolic diseases, with significant impact on years of disability adjusted life (DALYs) in the Europe-an region (WHO, 2006). Compulsory physical education and in the same way extra-curricular sports activities of secondary school children have a positive impact on car-diovascular risk factors. The results of our thesis confirmed the positive impact of compulsory PE for the child\u2019s body, and therefore the importance of taking measures for the de-velopment of physical activity in schools, in the family and beyond. Negative habits (avoid the PE and smoking) of lifestyle in young people often multiply. Qualified profes-sional teachers of PE and as well as parents play a key role in creation of positive attitude towards physical activities in children.\u201cThe movement is life\u201d and in case of cardio-vascular prevention this true are multiple (Farsk\u00fd, 2010). Parents should be an example for their children in a choice of extra \u2013 curricular sport activity. They should support children in sport activity with enthusiasm (Ra\u010dkov\u00e1, 2011)ReferencesCvopov\u00e1, A., \u010ci\u017em\u00e1rov\u00e1, E., Minichov\u00e1, J., 2011.

The rationale for this trend is there is an in-crease both for obesity and for nutrition related disorders those cause diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (Gallus et al., 2015; van Vliet-Ostaptchou et al., 2014; WHO, 2009). Thus tailoring the nutrition system in parallel to the com-munity\u2019s need, it\u2019s being reliable; effective and flexible are becoming more and more important each day.Awareness rising on healthy eating has not led to sig-nificant changes in patterns of food purchase and consump-tion so far.Bringing together industry, science, and the civil soci-ety in a meaningful exchange is essential to success in ad-dressing this pivotal challenge.Materials and methodsAs a first step all the food related and patient related organizations belonging to governmental, non-governmen-tal and business sector were tried to be determined. In the second phase the ones those will be enrolled to the Europe-an Awareness Scenario Workshops (EASWs) were select-ed randomly.European Scenario Workshop, also known by the ac-ronym EASW, is a qualitative research method which has been born in Denmark with purpose to find an agreement between the different group of actors at local level with the aim of reaching a consensual definition of city sustainable. It promotes discussion and participation. An EASW serves to foster democratic participation in decisions related to the improvement of living conditions in communities.EASW methodology is particularly suited to:\u2022\t encourage dialogue and participation of the various components of society;\u2022\t creating a balanced relationship between envi-ronment, technology and society;\u2022\t enable a sustainable development while re-specting the needs and aspirations of members of a local community (http://toolbox.climate-protection.eu/list-of-all-methodologies/ ).According to its application, the EASW method could be a tool for:\u2022\t information and learning,\u2022\t understanding and participation in the decision making process, common planning for the fu-ture\u2022\t identifying responsibilities and priorities or just any combination of the above.An EASW is built on three main activities:a.the development of scenariosb.stakeholder mapping c.EASW workshop for the development of visions and ideas The workshop typically lasts two days and goes through three phases: critical analysis phase, visionary phase and implementation phase (http://www.cipast..org/cipast.php?section=1012). Results and discussionIn the capital of Turkey we conducted three EASWs (one in 2012 October and two in 2013 June and Septem-ber). Totally 47 representatives from non-governmental, S3 OP 123266Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 265 - 266 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationsgovernmental and business sector participated in our Sce-nario workshops.In those EASWs the following were discussed:a.How research management and policy should be on food and health?b.In this sense should every kind of research be fund-ed?c.Which type of research should be supported? : Basic or practical research aiming contemporary issues?d.How research politics will be determined and shaped on innovative food production? Under these topics the following were found in terms of  \u201cNutrition and Innovative Approaches on Food Produc-tion\u201d for Turkey among NGO, business sector and govern-ment sector participants respectively:Change in living conditions (global warming, popu-lation growth, GMO, etc.) is a significant factor. Civil so-ciety opinion is ignored while doing research on innova-tive food production. Resources are being used ineffective-ly while doing food research. There is a lack of informa-tion on healthy nutrition among the society. Scientific re-search outcomes are not reflected to the policies. As the in-equalities become deeper, hunger; obesity; and social prob-lems become more. The media directs the individuals in a wrong way. Use of agricultural land(s) for different aim(s) is a big problem. There is a lack of inspection in food sec-tor. Healthy food options are expensive. Although the Con-sumer Protection Act exists there is a violation of consum-er rights.Resources are being wasted unwisely in researches. In order to make \u201chealthy nutrition as a never ending pro-cess\u201d, independent authorities (i.e. EFSA) should be estab-lished. There exist unfair competitions (both internal and external). There is very easily licensing process/easy cer-tification process on food production. Lots of misleading information are observed Consumers are unconscious in many ways. There is a deterioration of the food because of the long distances, etc. Unconsciousness exists in the steps of healthy food production.Institutions\u2019 working together is a must. On the oth-er hand bureaucracy is huge. Scientific data are not avail-able or accessible. Furthermore the ones those are accessi-ble lacks quality. There is a slow process in research and publication. Lack of national database is a big problem. Lack of National Policies for Sustainable Agriculture is an-other issue.ConclusionIn the light of the conducted EASWs we concluded that the projects should be handled according to the nation-al policies other than governmental policies. An indepen-dent institution is a must which will make healthy nutrition researches. This institution should also raise awareness among the community and make risk assessment. Innova-tion studies based on reliable and scientific data should be conducted. Three should be continuous dialogue/trialogue between/among NPO, government/public and academia/research institutions.ReferencesGallus, S., Lugo, A., Murisic B., Bosetti, C., Boffetta, P., La Vecchia, C., 2015.

IR is known to induce mutations and cell transformations, predominant-ly by causing single-strand and double-strand DNA break-age, thereby leading to chromosome instability and carci-nogenesis (Hayata, 2005). Genetic instability can be ana-lyzed by using cytogenetic parameters such as sister chro-matid exchange (SCE), and micronuclei (MN). It is known that cytogenetic damage accumulates in humans with age, due to the prolonged exposure to oxidative damage, chemi-cals as well as occupational, therapeutic or accidental radi-ation (Ramsey et al., 1995). However, studies on genotox-ic effects of low dose occupational exposure is limited and with contradicting results. IR is known to induce oxidative stress through gen-eration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in ox-idative damage to biomolecules such as deoxyribonucle-ic acid (DNA), proteins, and lipids (Chi et al., 2005). Aer-obic organisms possess antioxidant defense systems that deal with free radicals produced as a consequence of aero-bic respiration and substrate oxidation. Cells maintain their vital functions against oxidative stress status with the help of an antioxidant defense system that includes three major classes of antioxidant enzymes: the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (Sies, 1997). It has been hypothesized that chronic low-dose IR leads to oxidative stress but there are few studies to clarify oxidative stress status in radiology workers (Male-kirad et al., 2005). The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic ef-fects and oxidative stress status of occupational radiation exposure in radiology unit staff. Materials and methodsThe study population of 40 hospital workers occupa-tionally exposed to IR was comprised of 12 physicians and 28 technicians in the units of radiology at the Gulhane Mil-itary Medical Academy in Ankara, Turkey. Radiology unit personnel were healthy volunteers occupationally exposed to IR working 5 h/day in the hospital for a period of one to 30 years. The control group consisted of 30 individu-als (10 physicians and 20 administrative staff) working in the same hospital who had never been occupationally ex-posed to IR or chemicals. None of the study group partici-pants had reported unusual alcohol consumption. Vegetari-ans and those who used vitamin supplements, antioxidants or any therapeutic drugs were excluded. No one had under-taken any medical radiological examination or any carci-nogenic agent in the 6 months before blood sampling. The occupational exposure group were routinely mon-itored by personal exposure measurements devices (film badges), every 40 days. The radiation dose was estimat-ed from the official personal dosimeters based on thermo-luminiscent dosimeters. This dose range represents only the dose from a single month exposure and was measured within 6 months prior to enrolment in the study.Genotoxic effects were determined by using the cyto-kinesis-blocked micronucleus (CB-MN) and SCE tests in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Oxidative stress status was assessed by measuring the antioxidant enzyme activities of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), selenium S3 PP 124268Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 267 - 268  (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsdependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx), CAT and the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels as lipid peroxidation in-dex in erythrocytes. All statistical analyses were performed using the soft-ware SPSS 13.0 for Windows statistical package. Groups were compared with the Student t-test. The results were expressed as mean value \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Val-ues of p<0.05 and p<0.001 were considered to be statisti-cally significant. Results and discussionThe mean exposure dose of the radiological staff was 0.32\u00b10.69 mSv ranging from 0.10 to 3.86 mSvper month according to their individual dosimeters. None of them had recorded doses above the permitted levels of 20 mSv.It was found that the mean frequency of MN was sig-nificantly increased in radiation-exposed group compared to control group (p<0.05). This finding is in agreement with other studies (Maluf et al,2001; Zakeri and Assaei, 2004; Angelini et al., 2005). The mean frequency of SCE did not show any significant difference in the exposed in-dividuals in comparison to the controls (p>0.05). However, Engin et al. (2005) and Mrdjanovic et al. (2005) revealed that the frequency of SCE was significantly increased in all radiation-exposed individuals compared with controls. The enzymes activities of CuZn-SOD and Se-GPx observed for the exposed group were very significantly higher than in the control group (p<0.001). Oxidative stress causes various types of damage fol-lowed by cell death or an activation of the repair systems. Antioxidant enzymes are considered as a very important component of cell defense mechanisms which protect or-ganisms from the detrimental action of ROS damaging DNA and other biomolecules (Dimova et al. 2008). The enzyme activity of CAT and MDA levels in the exposed group were found significantly lower than in the control group (p<0.05, p<0.001, respectively). Our findings may be explained in terms of chronic low-dose radiation in-duced radiation hormesis. Low-dose radiation has been re-ported to induce hormesis, which is a beneficial stimulant effect of chronic low-dose radiation and radiation-adap-tive response (Prasad et al. 2004). However, its molecu-lar mechanism or signaling pathway is not yet known and needs to be clarified (Miura et al. 2002). Additional studies will provide essential information; in particular, larger and well-designed studies may be helpful. ConclusionWe observed that low dose chronic occupational ex-posure to ionizing radiation causes an increase of MN fre-quency in chromosomes, even though the absorbed dos-es were below the permissible limits. Although the small sample size prevents a definitive conclusion on the oxi-dative stress induced by occupational low dose IR expo-sure, nevertheless, our experimental evidences highlight the stimulant effect of the low dose IR on oxidative stress related parameters in hospital staff and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress.

They may contain a variety of in-gredients including vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals, or other dietary substances \u201cfor use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake\u201d. Dietary supplements are in the form of capsules, tablets, pills, and other similar pharmaceutical forms (Di-etary Supplement Health and Education Act, 1994).Medical evidence has suggested that dietary supple-mentation can be beneficial for a group of people, who do not have a balanced diet. In such cases, after nutritional deficiency has been detected, the increase in the intake of such nutrients is recommended, either by means of food or supplements (Gardiner et al., 2004).Age range that constitutes youth is important in many aspects. Physical growth and mental development of young population in adolescence will affect future physical and psychological chances as adults. The use of dietary supple-ments among adolescents seems to be influenced by their beliefs and attitudes that dietary supplements work. The media has contributed to stimulate the use of dietary sup-plements by spreading, for instance, the myth of the ide-al body. Consumption of supplements in European countries ranged between 17.9% and 60% of the population (Flynn et al., 2009, Tetens et al., 2011).During adolescence, a period when self-assurance is being developed, many adolescents do anything they can to meet that goal. Dietary supplements are sold in drug-stores or gyms as over-the-counter products without advice from a pharmacist.Based on the issues mentioned above, the objective of this study was to determine the frequency of dietary sup-plements consumption, types of supplements being con-sumed and reasons for consumption among high medical school students.Materials and methodsThe survey was conducted using an anonymous ques-tionnaire. The total of 238 students of medical high school, of which 162 were girls and 76 boys, were surveyed. The questionnaire includes gender and grade, as well as ques-tions concerning types and quantities of dietary supple-ments respondents use. The survey was conducted in April 2015. The methods of descriptive statistics were used in processing and analysing data, and then the differences of the obtained values were assessed via the chi-square test. In all analyses, differences were interpreted as statistically significant if the p-value is less than 0.05, and statistically significant if the p-value is less than 0.01.Results and discussionOf the total number of respondents 67.2% had used di-etary supplements. Overall, 79% of participants were fe-male. To determine the differences between gender with respect to dietary supplements consumption, chi-square test was used. Based on this test, it can be concluded that there is a statistically significant difference between the groups analysed (p = 0.00012, \u03c7\u00b2 = 20,626). No significant association was observed between supplement use and age. Of the total number of users of dietary supplements, 64.78% mostly bought in pharmacies, while others were purchased in supermarkets.

Gender differences in types of dietary supplements are apparent. Males were more likely to consume supplements to build muscle (p = 0.006), and females were more likely to consume supple-ments to increase weight (p = 0.002). The most common forms of dietary supplements being used are multivitamin, or individual vitamin/mineral prep-arations (particularly vitamin C). This finding is consistent with the data reported from other study (Kang et al., 2016; Moreno et al., 2014). This supplement, as the main report-ed supplement used among interns, indicates that they may be concerned about their nutritional adequacy in general. Thus, they selected a type of supplement providing a vari-ety of nutrients. Some studies shows the most commonly cited reasons for usage are to maintain or improve health, to increase en-ergy, to build muscle or increase weight, to decrease body fat or weight loss, to increase athletic ability, to help heal injury or illness, or because of an inadequate diet (Bailey et al., 2013; Dwyer et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2016) what is similar with findings in this study.Dietary supplement use in adolescents remains a con-troversial strategy to improve nutrient intakes because, even though their use is associated with lower preva-lence of inadequate intakes, it is also associated with an in-creased risk of excessive intakes.As the dietary supplement industry is now a multi-bil-lion dollar industry, there is growing pressure, and a subse-quent need for research to establish the efficacy and safe-ty of these products particularly for adolescent users. The psychological and educational components of such use cannot be ignored as they play an equally important role in the health and safety of adolescents.ConclusionIt is clear from the results of the current study that di-etary supplementation is popular among adolescents.There is need of further scientific research involving adolescents with the purpose of assessing the beneficial effects and safety of long-term dietary supplements use. More screening tests should be conducted on the consump-tion of dietary supplements among adolescents. Toxicity surveillance should be improved, and regulations of di-etary supplements market should be based on appropriate research. Nutritional education of adolescent is highly im-portant, especially among future medical workers. Finally, regulations on this topic could assist the activi-ty of health professionals and improve the education of the general population about the safe and effective use of di-etary supplements.ReferencesBailey, R.L., Gahche, J.J., Thomas, P.R., Dwyer, J.T., 2013.

General Hospital - Ohrid, Sirma Vojvoda 1, 6000 Ohrid, R. Macedonia, 2Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* spasovskamilena@yahoo.comIntroductionRenal failure (acute and chronic) is described as a de-crease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is a condition in which the kidneys are unable to adequately filter tox-ins and waste products from the blood. The cause of acute renal failure (ARF) is divided into sources of renal injury such as pre-renal, intrinsic and post-renal. In ARF there is an increase of blood urine nitrogen (BUN) and serum cre-atinine, and decrease urine production. It is characterized by abrupt decline in renal filtration function (Haller, 2000).In chronic renal failure (CRF) the amount of creati-nine is higher and glomerular filtration rate is lower. CRF is a progressive loss in kidney function over a period of time. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms but it gets worse gradually. The adverse outcome of CRF is kid-ney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death (Park, 2012).Chronic and acute renal failure can be primary distin-guished by different characteristics - cause and duration. CRF is a lifelong problem and it tends to get worse over months or years. Presence of disease in last few months, normochromic anemia, growth failure, and a history of nephritic or nephritic syndrome, high blood pressure, di-abetes mellitus, kidney stone, glomerulonephritis and in-fection make chronic renal failure more likely to happen (Saucier, 2010). Acute renal failure has a sudden onset and can occur as a complication of medical conditions, surgery, or trauma. Healthy kidneys produce a hormone - erythropoietin (EPO). The kidney cells that produce EPO are sensitive to low oxygen levels in the blood that passes through the kidney. EPO prompts the bone marrow to make red blood cells (Radtke, 1979). Red cell production due to the EPO deficiency is too low in CRF and causes development of anemia in this situation. Anemia is also seen in patients with acute renal failure, but the exact relationship between them remains unclear. In addition to anemia, platelet count also seems to be affected by renal disorder. The exact pat-tern of platelet count in patients with renal failure is contro-versial, but several studies revealed the decrease in platelet count in renal failure (Gafter, 1987; Prasad, 2012).The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of acute and chronic renal failure on severity of anemia and plate-let count.Materials and methodsThis case-control study was conducted on 92 patients with acute renal failure and 50 patients with chronic renal failure, and two groups of 95 and 75 individuals as con-trols. At first, all patients with proven renal failure were included in the study. Then, patients were divided in two groups of acute (<3 month) and chronic (>3month) based on disease duration. In order to eliminate the influences of sex and age when the observation group and the con-trolled group are compared, each of the two groups was se-lected according to the same sex and similar age. Initially, two separate blood samples were taken from each patient, 2 ml uncoagulated sample harvest for biochemical assay, and EDTA anti coagulated whole blood sample for com-plete blood cell count. To determine the levels of BUN and creatinine, the serums were used, and then complete blood counts were done with EDTA anti coagulated samples. Statistical independent T- test was used to evaluate the significance of the differences between the two groups. P<0.05 was considered as a significant change.S3 PP 126272Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 271 - 272 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionIn groups of patients with acute (53% male, 47% fe-male) and chronic (65% male, 35% female) renal failure, mean age was 56\u00b115 and 58\u00b111.5 years, respectively. In controlled groups of acute (49% male, 51% female) and chronic (73% male, 27% female) renal failure, mean age was 61\u00b112 and 63\u00b111 years, respectively.The average levels of BUN in patients with acute renal failure were 31.7\u00b17.4 mmol/L, which is above the normal value, compared to the control group (6.4\u00b12.1 mmol/L). The average of creatinine in patients with acute renal fail-ure is also above the normal value (256.3\u00b179.5 mmol/L) compared to the controlled groups (88.4\u00b135.3 mmol/L).The observation of the group of chronic patients also shows that BUN and creatinine are high (29.9\u00b18.9 mmol/L and 740.8\u00b1180.4 mmol/L) compared to normal ranges of the controlled group (5.3\u00b12.4 mmol/L and 88.4\u00b112.3 mmol/L).The levels of Hb, HCT, MCHC and RBC counts were significantly lower in the patient group in comparison to healthy, non-renal affected people (P < 0.05), and anemia was substantial in patients with acute renal failure.The study has also revealed that acute renal failure did not cause significant thrombocytopenia, and even the platelet count in these patients were slightly higher in com-parison to the controlled group.In patients with chronic renal failure, RBC count, he-moglobin, hematocrit level, MCHC, and platelet count are significantly lower than the controlled group (P < 0.05), but MCH and MCV levels are not significantly different be-tween these two groups (P > 0.05).ConclusionIn acute renal failure the ability of the kidney to elim-inate waste products, regulate acid-base balance, and man-age water homeostasis is rapidly declined. When this im-pairment is prolonged and has entered the chronic phase, the EPO secretion by this organ is decreasing. Low EPO level causes decrease of HCT, MCV, RBC and platelet counts. Therefore, the hematological changes in the blood count can be an early diagnostic marker for kidney failure. ReferencesHaller, M., Schelling, G., 2000. Acute kidney failure.

During the process, cuprous aluminium chloride (CuAlCl4) in an aromatic solvent (by instance toluene) is used in order to form a chemical complex with carbon monoxide, which is further recovered by more than 96%. So, one could con-sider this process as a reliable source of carbon monoxide in the case of downstream manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, some down sides of this pro-cess are associated to the partially poisoning of the copper catalyst, and to some environmental risks mostly related to the disposal of the used catalyst, to the recovery of copper and aluminium, as well as to the impact on human health of the different phases resulted from the process (Chadeesi-ngh, 2011). In this respect, toxicological studies of the different phases resulting from the Cosorb process could bring valuable information related to their potential impact onto human and environmental safety.  In this work, an in vivo study of the adverse effects of two phases (organic and inorganic) resulting from the Co-sorb process on skin hydration and barrier level was car-ried-on. For this aim, murine model (C57BL/6N and SKH-1 hairless mice) was used, and the evaluation of the ob-tained results was performed by means of Corneometry and Tewametry.Materials and methodsThe reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and were provided by Merck and Sigma\u2013Aldrich. The in-organic phase was evaluated by High-Resolution Contin-uum Source Atomic Absorption Spectrometer ContrAA 700. It was found that the main metals present in this phase are copper and aluminium, while zinc, chrome and iron are in traces. The analyze of the organic phase by means of gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Hewlett Pack-ard Gas Chromatograph HP 6890 associated with a Mass Spectrometer HP 5973) showed that the main compounds are toluene (84.46%) and some of its oxidation products (10.1%) (Simu et al., 2016). The in vivo study was performed on 4 months old C57BL/6N and SKH1 male mice (Charles River Labora-tories, Budapest, Hungary), according to the 2010/63/EU Directive (Coricovac et a., 2015; Simu et al., 2016). Mice were fed ad libitum and kept under standard conditions: 12-hours light/dark cycle, constant temperature of 22.5 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, and 55 \u00b1 5% humidity. Each type of mice (C57BL/6N and SKH1) were divided in 4 groups (5 mice/ group) as follows: the control group (1) - no interventions; group 2 in which the mice were treated once, topically, with 200\u00b5l of inorganic phase (on the dorsal side); group 3 in which the mice were treated once a day, 5 times/week with 100\u00b5l of inorganic phase, and group 4 in which the mice were treated once a day, 5 times/week with 100\u00b5l of organic phase. The animals were daily observed both at skin\u2019s level, and from behavior changes point of view. The eval-uation of the skin\u2019s response to the inorganic and the or-ganic phase\u2019s effect was performed by Corneometry and Tewametry. The physiological skin parameters, e.g. the hydration level of the skin surface and the transepidermal S3 PP 127274Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 273 - 274 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationswater loss (TEWL) were measured with the Multiprobe Adapter System (MPA5) from Courage-Khazaka Electron-ics (Germany), equipped with Tewameter\u00aeTM300 and Corneometer\u00aeCM 825 probes.Results and discussionMice are widely used as mammalian model organism in numerous studies related to subjects within the biomed-ical field in order to obtain answers and new insights onto the human health and welfare, in examining skin-related gene functions, as well as in modeling skin diseases. This is due to the fact that murine skin presents a great number of similarities with human skin.In this work, SKH-1 and C57BL/6N mice were used. SKH-1 mice are a variety of unpigmented and immuno-competent mice which are characterized by a more perme-able skin than the human one. Their skin is less permeable to benzo[a]pyrene than the skin of haired mice. Moreover, a prolonged in vitro hydration of their skin can generate a consistent increase in permeability, particularly to polar or ionized solutes. The C57BL/6N mice were used in order to emphasize the differences between pigmented skin model and the SKH-1\u2019s ones.Corneometry is a non-invasive technique which is able to estimate the hydration level of the skin surface (mainly at the stratum corneum level). The measurements associ-ated to this technique offer valuable information onto the modifications of the dielectric constant, due to skin surface hydration changing. So, this method presents a great deal of interest in dermatological and cosmetic applications, but also in formulation, claim support and efficacy testing of moisturizers. Corneometry is of great importance in objec-tive clinical diagnosis, as well as for monitoring therapies. The obtained results from the Corneometric study showed a significant decrease of the skin\u2019s hydration level in both types of mice, as well as for both studied aggressors (inorganic and organic phases). This decrease was noticed after the first 24 hours after application of the test solution, in both animal models. The decrease of this parameter may be associated to some toxicity signs, or may indicate the apparition of different injuries at skin level. It is important to note that in the case of the mice topically treated with the inorganic phase, some skin colour changes were noticed. Nowadays, Tewametry is used for many purposes, in-cluding dermatology (for objective clinical diagnosis) and occupational medicine, for monitoring and detecting skin damages, as well as in the testing of cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals. Through this technique, the TEWL parameter is assessed. This parameter brings information onto the skin\u2019s intrinsic properties, especially as its water barrier function. The measurements evaluate the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly, by means of temperature and relative humidity. Great val-ues of this parameter indicate that the water barrier func-tion of the skin become inefficient, or even some stratum corneous deteriorations. It was found that increased TEWL values can be associated with different skin diseases, but could be also induced by different chemical compounds. The evolution of the TEWL parameter was studied both for the inorganic phase solution and the organic one. The obtained results indicate a significant decrease of this parameter in both cases. In the case of both animal mod-els, it was noticed that the organic phase induced cutane-ous damages after only 2 weeks after exposition (2 weeks). However, the progress of lesions was slightly decreased when medical treatment was applied at this stage.ConclusionModifications of skin surface hydration level, and of the TEWL parameter were induced by the topical applica-tion of inorganic and organic phase solutions resulted from the Cosorb process. These results were more obvious in the case of the SKH1 mice model, and could be associated with the first signs of a short-term pathology at the skin\u2019s level.AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by the PN-II-PT-PC-CA-2013-4-0612 grant, nr. 110/2014 (REMACAT).ReferencesChadeesingh, R., 2011.

The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly supports breastfeed-ing for newborns from birth until 6 months postpartum as a global public health recommendation. Sometimes mothers are unable to make enough milk for the infant feeding and in such a case, milk-based infant formulas might be used as supplement to breast milk or may also be used as substi-tute if breastfeeding is impossible. Human milk provides the normative standard for infant nutrition with its unique composition that differs from infant formulas, although nu-trient composition of infant formulas is generally based to have similar functional properties as breast milk. Infant formula is a product based on milk of cows or other animals and/or other ingredients which have been proven to be suitable for infant feeding. Nowadays, a wide variety of infant formulas are available, so its nutritional safety and adequacy should be scientifically demonstrated to support normal growth and development of infants, es-pecially during the first 6 month of age. Infant formula is not officially a pharmaceutical prod-uct, though in many cases the manufacturers are pharma-ceutical companies. Regulatory bodies around the world agree that continual nutrient analysis is crucial in infant formulas quality control. The nutritional composition of all infant formulas must fulfill the global standards recom-mended by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroen-terology, Hepatology and Nutrition\u2019s (ESPGHAN) interna-tional expert group that was commissioned by The Codex Alimentarius Commission. These documents contain data about minimum and maximum values of nutrient contents in infant formulas with the goal to provide safe and nu-tritionally adequate infant formula products that meet the nutritional requirements of healthy babies during the first months of life until the introduction of appropriate comple-mentary feeding (Owens et al., 2012).Thiamine (vitamin B1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2) are nutritional components present in both breast milk and in-fant formulas which support normal infant growth. Thia-mine pyrophosphate as biologically active form of vitamin B1, is a cofactor for a number of key enzymes in Krebs cy-cle and in pentose phosphate pathway. Riboflavin is a pre-cursor of the flavin coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleo-tide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which par-ticipate in oxidation\u2013reduction reactions in many meta-bolic pathways. As FAD is part of the respiratory chain, riboflavin is central to energy production. Both vitamins are essential for development of infant tissues, function of muscles, heart, nervous system and mental activity. Also they are involved in carbohydrates, lipid and protein me-tabolism, red blood cell formation, respiration, antibody production and normal infant growth (Lali\u0107 et al., 2014; Sunari\u0107 et al., 2012). The levels of these vitamins in infant formulas are very important for term infants during the first 6 months of life, and especially for pre-term or low birth weight infants.The aim of this work was to determine thiamine and ri-boflavin content in some infant formulas available in Ser-bian pharmacies, as well as to define the level to which these infant formulas comply with the ESPGHAN recom-mendations and with Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) for infants.S3 PP 128276Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 275 - 276 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsMaterials and methodsTen most commonly used standard infant formulas were purchased from a local pharmacy. All analyzed brands were initial milk-based formulas designed for infant con-sumption during the first 6 months of life. Powdered sam-ples were dissolved and prepared following manufactur-er\u2019s instructions, in order to attain vitamins concentrations as given on the label.Samples preparation procedures and vitamins content analysis were done according to our previously published methods with minor modifications (Lali\u0107 et al., 2014; Sunari\u0107 et al., 2012). The percentage of compliance has been calculated with the mean minimum and maximum levels of vitamins according to ESPGHAN recommendations using the for-mula: Composition in 100 ml infant formula/ ESPGHAN mean value by 100 ml \u00d7 100.Results and discussionVitamins contents in analyzed samples were expressed as micrograms (\u03bcg) per 100 ml of prepared milk, as given on the label. The concentrations of thiamine and ribofla-vin in herein examined infant formulas were in the range of 57.5-91.3 \u03bcg/100 ml and 106.7-224.8 \u03bcg/100 ml, re-spectively. Also, values obtained for thiamine and ribofla-vin content in all samples accounted for over 88.5% of the values declared on the product label, with good precision (RSD < 1.8%, n = 5).The amounts of both vitamins in all analyzed samples exceeded the minimum requirements according to ESP-GHAN recommendations (48 \u03bcg/100 ml for thiamine and 180 \u03bcg/100 ml for riboflavin). The percentage of compli-ance was in the range of 39.9-63.4% for vitamin B1 and 19.8-41.6% for vitamin B2, respectively. These results were within the acceptable limits found in most of the lit-erature and very similar compared to the data in other stud-ies conducted according to ESPGHAN recommendations.Recommended Dietary Intake for infants (0-6 months old) are 200 \u03bcg/day for thiamine and 300 \u03bcg/day for ribo-flavin. Thus, assuming that the advised daily intake of 500 ml of prepared infant formula is optimal for 0- to 6-month infants, all analyzed samples supply much higher lev-els than the values established by the RDI for B1 (143.7-228.2%) and B2 (177.8-374.6%).ConclusionIn this work, thiamine and riboflavin content in differ-ent infant formulas available in Serbian pharmacies was determined. Levels of both vitamins in all samples were consistent with the values declared on the products label. Results of this study revealed that analyzed infant formu-las comply with the nutritional needs of infants with regard to vitamins B1 and B2. Their content in all samples ex-ceeds the RDI values, so there is an excess of these nutri-ents supplementation. Moreover, the satisfactory compli-ance with ESPGHAN recommendations was observed so analyzed milk-based formulas might be used as adequate breast milk supplements or substitutes.AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by grant TR 31060 from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological De-velopment of the Republic of Serbia.References Lali\u0107, J., Deni\u0107, M., Sunari\u0107, S., Koci\u0107, G., Truti\u0107, N., Miti\u0107, S., Jovanovi\u0107, T., 2014.

The determination of pesticides in fruits and vegetables has always been an important issue in ensuring the quality of the products, given the fact that residues of pesticides in raw food could affect the consummator (Abbassy et al., 2014). Neonicotinoid insecticides, which have a high affinity for insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Matsuda et al., 2001) are widely used to protect against a broad range of pests, including aphids, whitefly, thrips and mealy bugs. Their physicochemical properties make them useful for a wide range of application techniques, including seed treatment, soil drench, and foliar and stem application (Tomlin, 2009). Because some pesticides can be applied to crops up to the day before harvest, the residual pesticide concentrations in crops immediately after harvest may be relatively high. Among the neonicotinoid pesticides commercially available, imidacloprid and acetamiprid are of common use in our region. This study focuses on the residuals of acetamiprid on green peppers (Capsicum annum L.) one of the most important vegetable crops in our country. Various methods for neonicotinoid insecticide residue analysis have been reported, demonstrating that acetamiprid could be analyzed by both gas and liquid chromatography (Mateu-Sanchez et al., 2003; Navalon et al., 1997; Obana et al., 2002). According to the recommendation issued by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/WHO the Maximum Residual Levels (MLR) for acetamiprid in vegetables should not exceed 0.2 mg/kg. Materials and methodsThe study was conducted in a ventilated and temperature regulated greenhouse. The surface involved approximately 250 m2 and was divided in three main sections consisting of 30 plants each: S1 \u2013 untreated plants; S2 \u2013 plants treated with the minimal dose of acetamiprid (Mospilan\u00ae) 0,02%; and S3 - treated with the maximal dose of acetamiprid (Mospilan\u00ae) 0,04%. Considering that the Pre Harvest Interval (PHI) for acetamiprid is 7 days, the residual levels have been measured up to 9 days after spraying with two different concentrations of Mospilan\u00ae. Sampling was conducted in compliance with the guidelines published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CCPR, 2009).Approximately 300 g of vegetables were chopped into small pieces and blended in a homogenization apparatus so that a fine paste is formed. A portion of 5 g was accurately weighted and mixed with 10 g of hard-powdered synthetic magnesium-silica gel (Florisil\u00ae) in a mortar. Cleanup was carried out using a chromatographic column. The column (40 cm x 20 mm) was carefully prepared placing at the end glass wool and a thin layer of anhydrous sodium sulphate (Kadenezki et al., 1992). The column was then packed by transferring the mixture prepared in the mortar using a funnel.  Extract was eluted with 50 ml of ethyl acetate and acetone mixture and elute was evaporated to dryness on rotary evaporator and reconstituted in 1ml hexane. The cleaned extracts were analyzed on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with capillary column using an electron capture detector (ECD) (Chandra et al., 2010). Analysis of acetamiprid was carried out in a 30 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter and 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness coated DB-5 column. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 ml min-1 flow. The injector was set at constant temperature of 260 \u00b0C and the detector temperature was S3 PP 129278Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 277 - 278 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentations300 \u00b0C. The initial oven temperature was set at 170\u00b0C (1 min isothermal) then the temperature increased with a ramp of 10 \u00b0C/ min till 280 \u00b0C and subsequently isothermal for 15 minutes. The injection volume was 1\u00b5l. All the solvent used were HPLC grade.Results and discussionThe compound of interest was identified by comparing its retention time with respect to technical grade reference standard. The elution time for acetamiprid under the chosen chromatographic conditions was 7.29 min. The quantitative determination was carried out with the help of a calibration curve drawn from chromatographic experiments with standard solutions.  The limit of quantification (LoQ) was measured by the signal to noise ratio and was 0.01 \u03bcg/ml (ppm). The method was validated. Linear calibration curve was found between peak areas and analyte concentration in the whole range of the study. The linear regression (y = a + bx) parameters for method calibration were taken and the regression coefficients (R2) was near 0.998, which allows the quantification of this compound by the method of external standardization. Accuracy and precision were calculated based on repeated injections (n=5) and the RSD was 0.51%. Recovery studies were performed to examine the efficacy of extraction and clean up. Untreated peppers were spiked with known concentration of the pure insecticide standard solution and extraction and cleanup were performed as described earlier. The recovery was 93%.   Monitoring the degradation of acetamiprid, revealed that the samples treated with  the lowest dose of acetamiprid (0.02%) reached the MRL within seven days, whereas the samples treated with the highest dose (0.04%), could not reach the recommended MRL values for the same period of time. ConclusionVegetable growers have been using neonicotinoid pesticides frequently to have a higher and insect free yield. Unfortunately, overdoses of systemic pesticides sprayed on to the plant, fail to dissipate and do not reach the required MRL that are advisable by the WHO directives, constituting potential health risks to consumers. The pesticides residues can be decreased only if the recommended dose is applied by the vegetable. In conclusion, a further investigation upon PHI of acetamiprid should be conducted and the data would be of great benefit to cultivators in our region.  ReferencesAbbassy, A. M., Mamdouh, A.

Toluene also naturally occurs in the crude oil an in the tolu tree (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry - ATSDR, 2015). The main oxidation derivatives of toluene include benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, cresols or methyl-phenols, methyl-catechols and methyl-resorcinols. However, among these compounds, cresols are known to be more toxic then the others upon exposure. Cresols or methyl phenols are oxidation products of toluene, consist-ing of 3 isomers: o-cresol, m-cresol and p-cresol. Two of the compounds are colorless solids with low melting points (o-cresol and p-cresol), whereas the third one is a colorless thick liquid (Pubchem open chemistry database, https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Exposure to these substances often occurs by inhala-tion of contaminated air or accidental ingestion.Toluene induced toxicityThe main pharmacological effect, correlated with tol-uene intoxication in humans and animals, via inhalation, is the depression of the central nervous system (CNS) (Faust, 1994).  After the uptake into the blood stream, tol-uene crosses the blood brain barrier. In the brain, the sol-vent interacts with CNS neurotransmitters, especially \u03b3-aminobutyric acid and to a lesser degree, with glycine and dopamine, inducing symptoms like: euphoria, hallu-cinations, delusions, tinnitus, dizziness, confusion, head-ache, vertigo, seizures, ataxia, stupor, and coma (McKe-own, 2015). Toluene also influences locomotor activity in rats, as shown by Apawu et al. by modulating dopamine levels across the striatum. The study showed that acute and chronic exposure to toluene increased locomotor activity in rats and although dopamine levels in the striatum were increased, dopamine uptake was not affected (Apawu et al., 2015).Other toluene exposure induced effects include cardio-toxicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and skeletal muscle damage and reproduction system impairment.Symptoms related to the cardiovascular system in tol-uene exposure include blood pressure and heart rate fluc-tuations. Toluene exposed rats exhibited apoptosis in heart tissues mediated by increased caspase-3 activity (Tas et al., 2013). Toluene is metabolized in the liver to benzoic and hip-puric acid. The metabolism produces free oxygen radicals which cause liver damage through oxidative stress. A study by Tas et al. showed that rats exposed to toluene suffer se-vere liver damage exhibiting: increased levels of amino-transferase and malonylaldehyde (parameter for oxidative damage), balloon degeneration and fibrosis in the liver tis-sue (Tas et al., 2011). Liver cell apoptosis is also present, mediated by increased activity of Bax and caspase-3 en-zymes (Ayan et al., 2012). Toluene exposure affects the renal system, serum ion concentrations and locomotor activity. Patients exposed to toluene showed distal tubular renal acidosis type 1, hypo-kalemic acidosis, increased serum alkaline phosphatase, muscle paralysis and proteinuria due to rhabdomyolysis (Camara-Lemmaroy et al., 2015). Meydan et al. showed that rats exposed to toluene exhibited renal tissue damage. Shrinkage in the glomerular tufts, differentiation in the S3 PP 130280Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 279 - 280 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationscapsule, and increase in the connective tissue in the inter-stitial area all occurred. Also increased levels of serum cre-atinine, catalase and superoxide dismutase were observed (Meydan et al., 2013).Another study by Nakai et al., reported that toluene in-duces male reproductive dysfunctions in rats. The results suggested that toluene induced reproductive toxicity by di-rect oxidative damage of the spermatozoa was related to the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2019-dezoxyguanosine in the male rat testicles, which is a biological marker for DNA oxidative damage (Nakai et al., 2002).Cresol induced toxicityToxic effects of cresols due to inhalation can affect re-spiratory functions, and produce mucosal irritation. Sys-temic effects on humans due to inhalation are not report-ed but there are several studies that report cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, neurotoxicity in animals ex-posed to cresol aerosols (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry - ATSDR, 2008). Ingestion of cresols is more severe and can cause death in humans.The most studies regarding cresol toxicity are centered on p-cresol (4-methylphenol). P-cresol induces hepatotoxicity in rats. The mecha-nism proposed for hepatotoxicity induction involves bio-transformation of p-cresol to a reactive quinone methide intermediate which covalently binds to cellular macromol-ecules and elicits cytotoxicity (Thompson et al., 1996).  P-cresol is also a protein-bound uremic toxin (toxins which accumulate in the serum in chronic renal failure pa-tients treated with standard dialysis) (De Smet et al., 2003). A study by Tanaka et al. focused on the effects of p-cresol on 3T3-L1 cells. The results showed that p-cresol inhibit-ed cell proliferation, adipogenesis, glucose uptake and in-duced apoptosis in these cells (Tanaka et al., 2014). Anoth-er effect of p-cresol is the increase in the reactive oxygen species production, cell cycle proliferation arrest and apop-tosis stimulation, as stated by Chang et al. The study car-ried on U937 cell lines also revealed an induced delayed effect on endothelial cell migration which can be translated in an increase in the time needed for wound closure (Chang et al., 2014).ConclusionToluene and cresols are widely used in various indus-tries. Exposure to these compounds may lead to intoxica-tion. It is best that exposure is avoided taking in account that intoxication with toluene and cresols could be very dangerous since it can affect significant number of organs like the brain, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, muscles and re-productive glands.ReferencesApawu, A.K., Mathewc, T.A., Bowen, S.E., 2015.

Colostrum is a rich natural source of more than 90 essential nutrients: immune and growth factors, vitamins, minerals and ami-no acids. Bovine colostrum is milk produced during first few days after calving and its chemical composition is very similar to that found from humans. It contains high con-centrations of immunoglobulins, cytokines, growth fac-tors, lactoperoxidase, lactoferrin, transferrin, lysozyme, proline-rich polypeptides, lactalbumins and other proteins which play an important role for immunity and act as im-munomodulators. Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, E, folic and pantothenic acid and minerals: calcium, magne-sium, chromium, iron, zinc are also components of bovine colostrum (McGrath et al., 2016). Vitamin E is a lipid soluble vitamin responsible for a variety of functions in the body. The main biological func-tion of vitamin E is as an antioxidant which protects the polyunsaturated fatty acids of cell membranes from free-radical damage. Natural vitamin E includes two main groups of compounds: tocopherols (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4) and to-cotrienols (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4). Alpha-tocopherol is the most ac-tive, whereas the activity of the other tocopherols is 70\u201395% less.Colostrum is a natural food that has been used in tra-ditional medicine for hundreds of years. It has many bene-fits for resistance, strength and vitality of human body. This natural product is widely considered to help slow the aging process and assist with healing the body. Aging and disease are the result of losing the natural immune and growth fac-tors. It is considered helpful in alleviating the symptoms of influenza and the effects of some types of allergies and auto-immune diseases. It helps balance blood sugar levels and increase mental alertness and assists with weight loss. Since colostrum is an important and rich source of immune and growth factors, it is recommended regular intake, at all ages (Donovan and Odle, 1994). Pharmaceutical colos-trums are based on bovine sources and they are safe and effective health supplements. They are produced as pow-der or capsules as dietary products for oral intake. Vitamin E is an important component of colostrum. The esterified form of vitamin E (tocopherol acetate) is commonly used in commercial pharmaceutical health supplements because of better stability in the products.For the vitamin E determination purification of the sample is necessary in order to perform HPLC analysis, be-cause of colostrum is very complex sample and cannot be directly injected into the HPLC column. The objective of this study was to evaluate both \u03b1-tocopherol and tocopher-ol acetate content in commercial pharmaceutical colostrum product by using previously developed solid phase extrac-tion (SPE) and HPLC method. Materials and methodsStandards of \u03b1-tocopherol and tocopherol acetate (TA) of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All solvents were analytical grade (JT Baker, Deventer, Netherlands). Chromabond C18 ec cartridges, used for purification of samples, were pur-chased from Macherey-Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany. Concentrations of \u03b1-tocopherol and tocopherol acetate in analyzed samples were determined by calibration curve method. The range of the calibration curve was 0.01-0.5 \u03bcg/mL for \u03b1-tocopherol and 0.2-2.0 \u03bcg/mL for tocopher-ol acetate. The stock standard solutions of \u03b1-tocopherol (1 mg/mL) and tocopherol acetate (1 mg/mL) were prepared by dissolving standards in absolute ethanol. The working S3 PP 131282Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 281 - 282 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationscalibration solutions were freshly prepared for each run by diluting the stock standard with absolute ethanol.Commercial pharmaceutical colostrum was obtained from local pharmacy. One of the bovine colostrum prod-ucts, available on the Serbian market is Ekolostrum\u00ae. This product was made from the fresh bovine colostrum ob-tained in the first 16 hours after calving. Ekolostrum\u00ae cap-sule contains 480 mg high-quality 100% natural bovine co-lostrum powder with no additives and flavouring. The con-tent of any form of vitamin E was not exactly declared.Sample preparation: 500 mg of powder sample from the capsule was weighted and dissolved in 50 mL of deion-ized water. After complete dissolving, 1 mL of the sample was treated with 0.5 mL of 0.5% ascorbic acid and 5 mL of absolute ethanol. The mixture was vortexed vigorously for 1 min and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 20 \u00b0C. Fi-nally, supernatant was purified with solid phase extraction. Based on our previously extraction recovery evalua-tion, Chromabond C18 ec column was selected among five different types of cartridges. Chromabond C18 ec was pre-conditioned by passing through 1 mL of deonized water, followed by 1 mL of methanol and 1 mL of acetonitrile. Then, 3 mL of supernatant was slowly passed through the cartridge at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and the analyte was eluted with 2 x 1 mL of methanol. HPLC determination was achieved at 40 \u00b0C using RESTEK Ultra IBD column (3\u00b5m, 150x3mm) with the mo-bile phase consisted of 100% acetonitrile and fluorescence detection (\u03bbex=295 nm, \u03bbem=330 nm) for \u03b1-tocopherol and UV detection at 220 nm for tocopherol acetate. The flow rate was kept at 0.45 mL/min.Results and discussionThe analyzed samples of commercial colostrum sup-plement had average \u03b1-tocopherol and tocopherol ace-tate concentration of (0.2\u00b10.01) mg/100 g and (6.5\u00b10.3) mg/100 g, respectively. The content of \u03b1-tocopherol in the examined pharmaceutical colostrum was similar to that for the fresh bovine colostrum found by Kehoe et al. (2007), who reported that the concentration of \u03b1-tocopherol is in ranges from 0.06 to 1.04 mg/100 g, with a mean value of 0.29 mg/100 g. On the other hand, the found value was lower than for human colostrum (1.28 mg/100 g) reported in our previous work.The high content of the synthetic form of vitamin E (tocopherol acetate) was found in the examined sample. Tocopherol acetate is not naturally present neither in bo-vine nor in human colostrum. TA is added to many pharma-ceutical and dietary products for the fortification and en-richment, but it needs to be hydrolyzed in gut to free to-copherol which exerts its activity in vivo. Also, the differ-ent vitamin E stereoisomers obtained by hydrolysis of TA have different biopotencies.ConclusionThis work showed that the SPE method was success-fully applied for the preparation of colostrum samples for HPLC simultaneous determination of \u03b1-tocopherol and to-copherol acetate, which is important for the quality control for this type of pharmaceutical products. Examined bovine colostrum product contains appropriate amounts of vita-min E, therefore it can be considered as important nutri-tional source of vitamin E and good supplement for all gen-erations.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by grant TR 31060 from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological De-velopment of the Republic of Serbia.ReferencesDonovan, S.M. and Odle, J., 1994.

In this view zinc, chromium, copper and selenium are having a special role in preventing micro- and macro vascular diabetic com-plications, as integral components of antioxidant enzymes and also as cofactor of enzymes and hormones involved in the metabolism of glucose and lipid. Results of numerous studies also suggested that, because of hyperzincuria and low zinc absorption, diabetic patients are more susceptible to zinc deficiency compared to healthy persons. On the other side, it`s known that zinc, as divalent cat-ion, compete with cadmium, copper, lead, iron and calci-um for similar binding site. The physiological effects of zinc and several other cations such as copper and calci-um are due to alteration in the permeability of the cellu-lar membrane or modulation of the activity of membrane-bound enzymes. It has been reported that zinc may sup-press calcium effect by displacement of calcium ions from its cell binding sites, thus altering the membrane calcium pump resulting in a reduction in free intracellular calcium (Pathak et al., 2011). Copper deficiency might be a contrib-utor to the glucose intolerance in diabetic patients.There are also reports of altered metabolisms of other micronutrients such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) in diabe-tes. Moreover, previous investigation reported that Zn de-ficiency increases the absorption of intestinal Cu and that Cu significantly inhibits the influx of Zn across the intesti-nal brush border membrane (Condomina et al., 2002). It`s only unknown whether Zn supplementation can normalize the Cu/Zn ratio. Iron is capable of generating reactive ox-ygen species and contributes to diabetic nephropathy. Ex-cess Fe has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications.In view of these facts, the aim of our study was to eval-uate the effects of three different single doses of zinc glu-conate on serum copper, iron and calcium levels in exper-imentally induced diabetic rabbit and type 2 diabetic pa-tients.Materials and methodsThe experimentally study was conducted on twenty-four New Zealand rabbits, weighing 2 to 3.5 kg. Experi-mental diabetes was induced in rabbits by intravenous in-jection of alloxan (80 mg/kg BW). Two weeks after ap-plication of alloxan, animals were subjected to 16h fast-ing, which was determined by the concentration of glucose in the blood. The test includes only 14 rabbits with fast-ing glucose between 9.99 and 14.98 mmol/L, which corre-sponds to the degree of damage of the pancreas in patients with insulin-independent diabetes mellitus. Three weeks after induced experimental diabetes, rabbits were treated orally appropriate doses of zinc gluconate determinate by Clarc formula: first dose 5.5 mg, after the washout period S3 PP 132284Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 283 - 284 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentations(10 t1/2) - second dose 9.2 mg, after the washout period (10 t1/2) - third dose 18.4 mg. Blood samples were taken at certain time intervals: before and 24h after the first, sec-ond and third dose of zinc gluconate. The human study was conducted on a group of 12 pa-tients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a control group of 12 healthy subjects. All participants did not take nutritional supplements and any drugs that are known to interfere with metabolism of studied metals during the period of study and at least 2 week before sampling. Blood samples were drawn after an overnight fasting in both groups, before and 24 hour after administration of zinc gluconate in three dif-ferent single doses (15, 25 and 50 mg) with washout peri-od (10 t1/2) between treatments.All the material used for zinc collection, separation and storage was plastic and metal free. Serum samples were frozen and stored at -20 \u00baC until the time of measure-ment.  Determination of concentrations essential minerals (Zn, Cu, Fe and Ca) was performed by colorimetric meth-od (Randox and Roche Diagnostics assays). Each value is expressed as the mean\u00b1SD. Differenc-es between groups were examined using the unpaired Student`s t-test, differences in the group were examined using the paired Student`s t-test and to asses possible rela-tionship between different variables, Pearson`s correlation coefficient (r) was used. The study protocol was approved by Ethical Commit-tee of the University of Pristina Faculty of Medicine, in Kosovska Mitrovica (Serbia). All subjects gave written, in-formed consent. The animals were handled in accordance with the European Community guidelines (86/609/ EEC).  ResultsDifferent single doses of zinc gluconate did not cause any significant change on copper, iron and calcium levels in serum of healthy rabbits. However, in diabetic rabbits the calcium concentration in serum was significantly de-creased 24h after zinc gluconate administration in doses of 9.2 and 16.4 mg, compared with the baseline value (0h) marked before the treatments (p=0.041; p=0.039).Also, different single doses of zinc gluconate did not cause any significant change on copper, iron and calcium levels in serum of healthy subjects. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were found significant decreased the se-rum calcium concentration 24h after zinc gluconate admin-istration in dose of 50 mg compared with the baseline val-ue (0h) marked before the treatment (p=0.038). The Cu/Zn ratio were significantly reduced in diabetic patients 24h after zinc gluconate administration in doses of 25 and 50 mg compared with baseline values (0h) marked before the treatment (p=0.033; p=0.026). ConclusionsBased on obtained results it can be observed that ad-ministration of zinc gluconate in single higher doses showed reduction of serum calcium level in type 2 diabe-tes mellitus. Considering that zinc, as divalent cation, com-pete with calcium for similar binding site, this could to be due to antagonistic effect of zinc on calcium. Also, the administration of zinc gluconate in single higher doses decreased the Cu/Zn ratio only in type 2 dia-betic patients. These results are very significant consider-ing that previous studies reported that an impaired Cu/Zn ratio in serum from diabetics could be an important factor in the development of micro- and macro-vascular compli-cations in type 2 diabetes mellitus.ReferencesCondomina, J., Zornoza-Sabina, T., Granero, L., Polache, A., 2002.

Cyril and Methodious\u201d, Mother Theresa 47, Skopje, Macedonia* tpetreska@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionProbiotics are widely used as functional ingredients because they beneficially affect the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance. Accepted dose of live probi-otic bacteria is required to be between 106-108 CFU per mL or g of the food product at the time of consumption (Vasiljevic and Shah, 2008). As probiotic viability is con-sidered essential for their health benefits, viability of pro-biotic bacteria in foods throughout their storage is a con-stant challenge for the food industry. Dairy foods are the most frequently used as probiotic carriers and well accept-ed by the consumers, while development of non-dairy ma-trices has been encouraged due to the increasing demand for new probiotic products. Food matrix was found to play an important role in the beneficial health effects of probi-otics on the host (Do Esp\u00edrito Santo et al., 2011). Incorpo-ration of microencapsulated probiotics is a potential strate-gy for manufacture of both dairy and non-dairy products at the same time improving the functional value of the prod-uct and ensuring protection of living cells from unfavor-able conditions.The aim of the present study was to examine the sur-vival and metabolic activity of probiotic strain Lactobacil-lus casei 01 both in dairy product (ayran) and non-dairy matrix (carrot juice) during storage for two weeks at 4 \u00b0C.Materials and methodsThe cell suspension of probiotic Lactobacillus casei 01 (Chr. Hansen, Denmark) was divided into two parts: one part was used for microencapsulation and another was used as free cells for direct adding in carrot juice prepared by extraction of washed and peeled carrots and commer-cially available ayran (Ayran, Zdravje Radovo, Macedo-nia). Carrot juice samples after pasteurization at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min was fermented using a cell concentration of 7.4\u00b10.1 log CFU/mL according to the recommendations for min-imum counts of approximately 7.0 log CFU per g or mL of probiotic food to exert beneficial effects (Vasiljevic and Shah, 2008). Prebiotics fructooligosaccharides (FOS) with DP > 10 (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy 1) which is the mixture of oligofructose (DP 2-8) and long-chain inulin fraction (DP 10-60) (Orafti-Rue L. Mar\u00e9chal, Belgium) were added to carrot juice and ayran samples containing non-encapsulated cells, respec-tively, at the same time with the probiotic cells. An opti-mal formulation of microparticles containing FOS or Syn-ergy 1 as prebiotic with high cell viability of L. casei 01 (11.28-11.38 log CFU/g) was prepared using 4% w/w algi-nate, 0.5% w/w chitosan and 5% w/w CaCl2 (Petreska Iva-novska et al., 2014). An aqueous dispersion of alginate (LF 10/60 LS, fG 35-45% Protanal, FMC Biopolymer, IMCD, UK), prebiotic at a level of 1.5 w/w and L. casei 01 with a cell load ca. 12 log CFU/mL was submitted to spray-drying (nozzle diameter 0.7 mm, aspirator pressure 90%, flow rate 6 mL/min, inlet and outlet temperature, 120 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C; B\u00fcchi Mini Spray Dryer B-290, SW) followed by subse-quent cross-linking and coating in solution of CaCl2 (Mer-ck, Germany) and chitosan (Chitine, France) in 1% v/v acetic acid. The microparticles formed were cured at least 3 h, separated and freeze-dried (-50 \u00b0C, 0.070 mbar, 24 h, FreeZone Freeze Dry System, Labconco, USA). Synbiot-ic microparticles were added to the carrot juice and ayran, respectively, on the same day of preparation. All samples were packed into sterile flasks and stored at 4 \u00b0C. The via-bility of L. casei 01 was determined on MRS agar (Merck, Germany) after 72 h of incubation at 37 \u00b0C using a plate-count method. For enumeration of bacteria, 1 mL of the S3 PP 133286Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 285 - 286 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationssample was mixed with 9.0 mL of peptone water, vortexed for 15 s and serially diluted with peptone water. In the sam-ples containing microparticles enumeration was done after removing the particles by filtration, washing with sterile saline solution and liquefying with phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). The pH values of synbiotic samples were also exam-ined (pH meter PB 11 Sartorius, Germany). The production of lactic and acetic acid was measured using HPLC (Agile-nt Technologies 1200, USA) by loading supernatants of the pretreated samples with 0.5 M H2SO4 on a reverse phase column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, Discovery HS C 18, Su-pelco Park, USA) set at 40 \u00b0C and eluted with 0.005 M H2SO4 at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with detection wave-length of 210 nm.Results and discussionEncapsulated L. casei 01 added to ayran either carrot juice survived significantly better compared to non-encap-sulated cells upon cold storage due to the ability of chito-san-coated alginate particles to preserve cell viability. Rel-atively high viable cell counts in carrot juice and ayran at the end of storage were observed, 9.11 and 8.22 log CFU/mL, respectively. The viability of free and encapsulated L. casei 01 in ayran samples was reduced for 3.38 and 1.21 log CFU/mL, respectively, while the corresponding cell vi-ability loss in carrot juices was 1.49 and 0.44 log CFU/mL. Results have shown that both non-encapsulated and encap-sulated L. casei 01 survived better in carrot juice compared to ayran. This finding may be the result of characteristics of probiotic strain or substrate as well as the oxygen con-tent in the product. Acidity of the carrot juice as substrate was determined to be lower than ayran acidity (pH 6.25 vs. 4.55, respectively). The mild acidity of carrot juice de-clined to 4.23 and 5.44 after fermentation with free and en-capsulated L. casei 01, respectively, while pH values mea-sured in ayran samples enriched with free and encapsulat-ed L. casei 01 were 4.54 and 4.58, respectively. The reduc-tion of pH values was similar in both carrot juice or ayran samples during the storage, but ayran contains 0.4% salt which may contribute to further reduction of the cell via-bility. Probiotic culture L. casei 01 produced higher quan-tity of lactic acid in ayran samples compared to carrot juice samples due to the presence of lactose in dairy products. In ayran samples containing non-encapsulated and encap-sulated synbiotic, the concentration of lactic acid tend to increase during storage from initial values of 51.32 and 56.94 mmoL/L to 59.14 and 72.36 mmoL/L, respective-ly. Production of acetic acid was lower, but with similar in-creasing trend to those of lactic acid. As the result of sac-charolytic activity of the probiotic culture able to ferment sugars present in the carrot juice, production of lactic and acetic acid was observed. Initially measured concentra-tion of 30.53 mmoL/L lactic acid remained constant during the storage of the carrot juice containing non-encapsulat-ed synbiotic, while initial concentration of 18.43 mmoL/L lactic acid of the sample with encapsulated synbiotic in-creased to 31.53 mmoL/L at the end of storage. In the car-rot juice samples both containing non-encapsulated or en-capsulated synbiotic, the concentration of acetic acid was significantly lower compared to corresponding ayran sam-ples and tend to decrease during the storage period. How-ever, in both dairy either non-dairy product, the metabolic activity of L. casei 01 was better retained in samples with encapsulated synbiotic as lactic acid is the main product of lactobacilli metabolism.ConclusionSurvival rate of the encapsulated L. casei 01 incor-porated in carrot juice as well in ayran was found to be above the therapeutic level with retained metabolic cell activity during the investigation period. The results have shown higher probiotic viability in carrot juice compared to ayran, albeit dairy products are naturally connected with lactic acid bacteria. Further, synbiotic carrot juice may be offered to lactose intolerant individuals and to those suffer-ing from cardiovascular diseases. Additional studies to in-vestigate the influence of the food matrix in preserving cell viability under gastrointestinal conditions as well the abil-ity of the matrix to deliver viable cells to the lower intes-tine are required.ReferencesDo Esp\u00edrito Santo, A.P., Perego, P., Converti, A., Oliveira, M.N., 2011.

It has been reported that the consumption of low alcohol wines had a very positive effect on the consumer\u2019s health. Thus, Karatzi (Karatzi et al., 2004), showed that the consump-tion of 250 mL per day of alcohol free wine has improved the condition of the cardio-vascular system in patients with a progressive coronary disease. There are, also, literature data witnessing the benefit of alcohol free wine consump-tion and its connection with lowering the high blood pres-sure (Chiva-Blanch et al., 2012). In order to produce low or alcohol free wines, food in-dustry applies several pre-fermentative, during and post-fermentative procedures. Post-fermentative techniques are usually physical like pervaporation or utilization of spin-ning cone column, but all of these processes have draw-backs such are specific and expensive equipment and changes in aromatic composition (Heux et al., 2006).Unlike post-fermentative, pre-fermentative enzymatic methods for lowering the alcohol level in wines are fast-er, high specific methods that minimize loss or alteration of sensory qualities and off-flavor development (Schmid-ke et al., 2012). In this paper the effect of glucose concentration in the minimal model must on the enzymatic activity of sever-al different commercial glucose oxidase preparations was examined. The first one was the commercial bakery addi-tive Alphamalt Gloxy 5080 (glucooxidase and low catalase activity). The second one was pure glucooxidase from the mould Aspergillus niger and the third preparation was cou-pled mould glucooxidase and a beef liver catalase. The glu-cose concentration of 10 g/L and 100 g/L were used as sug-ar concentrations in the minimal model must. The effect of the enzyme activity on the final pH of the reaction media was also studied.Materials and methodsEnzymatic preparations: Alphamalt Gloxy 5080 (Muhlenchemie, Germany) was a commercial enzyme preparation obtained from Aspergillus niger strain. This was a food grade bakery additive with activity of 10500 units per gram (U/g) and low catalase activity. The pure glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4) was in its ly-ophilized form and was also derived from Aspergillus ni-ger (Merck, Germany). This preparation was with much lower activity than the previous one. The activity of the ly-ophilized glucose oxidase was 8 U/mg. The liquid catalase (Merck, Germany) was obtained from beef liver and had an activity of 1300000 U/mL. Media: A medium with high glucose concentration of 100 g/L was prepared. This high concentration was chosen to be of the same order of magnitude as the one measured in the real must. For comparison, the medium with low-er concentration of glucose of 10 g/L was also used.  The minimal model must, besides glucose, was also containing 4.0 g/L tartaric acid, 1.5 g/L malic acid and 0.5 g/L citric acid. The pH of the medium was adjusted to pH 3.5 using sodium hydroxide (10 M NaOH) to be similar as the pH of the real must.Glucose oxidase reaction: All the three preparation used were diluted in the medium to give a certain concen-tration of the enzyme preparation. The reactions were car-S3 PP 134288Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 287 - 288 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsried on an orbital shaker (Ceromat R, B. Brown Biotech In-ternational) with agitation rate of 150 rpm (oxygen disso-lution) in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of medium. The reaction temperature was kept 30 \u00b0C.Determination of glucose concentration: D-glucose was measured using DNS method for determination of reduced sugars (Miller, 1959). The absorbance was mea-sured on a spectrophotometer Cary 50 Scan (Varian) at 540 nm wave length.Determination of pH value: The pH value of the media was determined by utilization of Sartorius Basic pH Meter PB-11. The pH value was determined at the beginning (ini-tial pH value) and at the end of the enzymatic reaction (fi-nal pH value).Results and discussionEnzymatic reaction in the minimal model must with 10 g/L glucoseThe effect of the lower concentration of glucose, 10 g/L, on the enzymatic activity was evaluated by utilizing three different glucose oxidase preparations in the medi-um simulating a must (minimal model must). Those were Alphamalt Gloxy 5080, pure glucose oxidase and the third one was a combination of glucose oxidase and catalase. The most active of all the three was the commercial Alpha-malt Gloxy 5080 preparation, showing even 71.12% con-version at the 24th hour of the reaction. Unlike the Alpha-malt Gloxy 5080, the other two glucose oxidase prepara-tions showed negligible activity towards the glucose sub-strate used in the concentration of 10 g/L. It was, thus, ob-vious, that not even the presence of catalase could increase the activity of the pure glucose oxidase, in this, not favor-able conditions for the enzyme activity (pH 3.5).Enzymatic reaction in the minimal model must with 100 g/LIn the second experiment, ten times higher concentra-tion of glucose was used, as it was actually necessary to simulate the concentration of glucose present in the real must (approx. 100 g/L glucose+100 g/L fructose). None of the three enzymatic preparations used was active enough at this high concentration of glucose. However, the Alpha-malt Gloxy 5080 showed certain activity. Namely, during the reaction period of 120 hours it converted only 7.37% of the substrate. It can be assumed that for the conversion of glucose into gluconic acid in media with high glucose con-centration, at these unfavorable conditions for glucose ox-idase activity, the acidic environment, high concentrations of enzyme preparation, preferably Alphamalt Gloxy 5080, should be used.  The pH value of the media and its difference between the initial and the final value (after the reaction), is also a good indirect indicator of the enzymatic activity. Thus, the very logical results were obtained when the pH value of the medium containing 100 g/L was used as a minimal model must. Only a very slight difference in the pH value (from 3.55 to 3.50) was measured in the medium with coupled glucose oxidase/ catalase enzymatic system used as a cata-lyst. It was interesting that the Alphamalt Gloxy 5080 has changed the pH value of the medium from 3.50 to pH 3.00, and it was the most active enzymatic preparation among the three examined.ConclusionThe effect of glucose concentration on the enzyme ac-tivity was evaluated by utilization of three different enzy-matic preparations. It was found out that the commercial bakery additive Alphamalt Gloxy 5080 was the most suit-able enzymatic preparation for glucose oxidation, at as low pH of the medium as pH 3.5, although even this enzymatic preparation was not very active at the higher glucose con-centration (100 g/L). This paper is only a part of the com-plex research process for development of a sophisticated method for pre-fermentative lowering of the sugar concen-tration in the must, with a final aim- production of low al-cohol wine.

Macedonia2Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* suzanaangelova@yahoo.comIntroductionHumans can be exposed to heavy metals through var-ious ways, including consumption of contaminated food. Although heavy metals are usually present in foods at very low levels, long-term exposure can have negative health impacts. According to the Macedonian regulations for gen-eral requirements for food safety, determination of cadmi-um (Cd) and lead (Pb) are obligatory. It can enter food ei-ther through environmental processes or through contami-nation in processing and/or packaging. Therefore, it is very important to measure levels of Cd and Pb in a variety of food matrices. A major challenge in the analysis of food samples is the extremely low analyte levels versus the very high matrix levels. The most commonly used technique for the determination of Pb and Cd is a graphite furnace atom-ic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) after microwave di-gestion (Kenneth, 2014; Belc et al., 2014).This article will present the use of GFAAS for the de-termination of Pb and Cd in a variety food samples.Materials and methodsChemicalsAll solutions were prepared in polypropylene volu-metric flasks using ultra pure deionized water. All the plas-tic and glassware were cleaned by soaking in dilute HNO3 (1+9), were rinsed with distilled water and air dried before use. All reagents used (nitric acid 65%, hydrochloric acid 30%, hydrogen peroxide 30%) were of Suprapure quality (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).  Lead and cadmium stock solutions, 1000 mg/L (Mer-ck, Darmstadt, Germany) are commercially available. Cadmium and lead working solutions were prepared fresh daily by dilution of the cadmium and lead stock solutions with 0.5% (v/v) nitric acid.Mixtures of palladium [(Pd(NO3)2] and magnesium ni-trate [Mg(NO3)2x6H2O] in deionized water was used for Cd analysis. Ammonia phosphate [NH4H2PO4] and magne-sium nitrate [Mg(NO3)2x6H2O] was used for Pb analysis. Matrix modifiers were added automatically to each blank and samples. SamplesDifferent samples were bought from local markets and/or were brought to our laboratory by border health inspec-tors: 160  cereal samples  and their products (113 wheat, 40 wheat flour, 4 barley; 3 oat flakes); 13  piper samples; 5 on-ion samples, 3 garlic samples; 2 cabbage samples; 2 beet-root samples; 4 mushrooms samples and 7 potato samples.Sample preparationThe samples were dried at 105 \u02daC for 24 h. Dried samples were homogenized using an agate pestle and stored in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles until analysis.Microwave digestion system Multiwave 3000 Anton Paar equipped with quartz vessels Q80, was used for sam-ple preparation. The samples were rapidly digested in a mi-crowave oven. Samples of 300 mg each were accurately weighed into the digestion vessels, followed by the addi-tion of  nitric acid  (65%), and/or hydrochloric acid (30%) and/or hydrogen peroxide (30%),  all suprapure quality. A blank digest was carried out in the same way. Than ves-sels were placed into the rotor and heated in the microwave oven, according to the temperature program recommended by the manufacturer. The rotor was removed from the mi-S3 PP 135290Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 289 - 290 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationscrowave oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. The vessels were carefully opened in a fume cupboard and the inner walls rinsed with ultra pure deionized water. The final volume of each sample was made up to 20 mL with. All sample solutions were clear.GF AAS conditions  All samples were analyzed using a GFAAS. The wave-length and GFAAS instrument parameters for the determi-nation of lead and cadmium are according to the MKC EN 14083:2010. A Perkin Elmer A Analyst 600 was used for heavy metals analyses, equipped with THGA Graphite Furnace and  Zeeman background correction, AS-800 Au-tosampler. Winlab 32 software for the acquisition and pro-cessing of data was used.Methods Calibrations were performed using external standards. The limits of detection (LOD) were calculated as triplicate, and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were calculated as six times the standard deviation of repeated measurement of a blank solution. The accuracy of the method was tested by lead and cadmium reference materials with certified known lead and cadmium content and expressed through z-scores re-sults (-2 \u2264 z \u2264 2).  Recovery checks were carried out us-ing spikes.Repeatability was estimated for lead and cadmium, based on standard deviation and relative standard devia-tion, using the data from the QC sample analyses.Results and discussionThree working standard solutions were used for the linearity testing. Lead was calibrated at 10 \u00b5g/l, 20 \u00b5g/l and 30 \u00b5g/l, resulting in a calibration correlation coeffi-cient (R2) of > 0.999. Cadmium was calibrated at 1 \u00b5g/l, 2 \u00b5g/l and 3 \u00b5g/l, resulting in a calibration correlation coef-ficient (R2) of > 0.999.   The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.2 \u00b5g/l for Pb and 0.1 \u00b5g/l for Cd. The limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.5 \u00b5g/l for Pb and 0.3 \u00b5g/l for Cd.  The values obtained matched closely with the certified values (z- score for Cd was 0.1 and for Pb - 0.3). The obtained results were satis-factory, showing levels of Pb and Cd close to the allowed levels of concentration. The recoveries of the trace metals were in the range from 95% for Cd and 103% for Pb.  The standard deviations were less than 5%.Lead content of almost all cereal samples is bellow 0.2 mg/kg limit according to national regulation (Official Ga-zette of Republic of Macedonia, 102/2013), except for the six samples where the concentration of lead was 0.574 mg/kg, 0.820 mg/kg, 0.901 mg/kg, 0.721 mg/kg, 0.255 mg/kg and 0.385 mg/kg. These concentrations exceed the maxi-mum allowed concentration. Cadmium content of all ce-real samples is bellow 0.2 mg/kg according to the nation-al regulations. Lead and cadmium content of all vegetables samples (onion, garlic, beetroot, and potato) is bellow 0.1 mg/kg (maximum permitted limits by national regulation).  Lead content of piper samples is bellow 0.1 mg/kg and for cabbage and mushrooms is bellow 0.3 mg/kg, (maxi-mum permitted limits by national regulation).  Cadmium content is bellow 0.05 mg/kg for piper and 0.2 mg/kg for cabbage and mushrooms.ConclusionThe proposed method for trace heavy metal determi-nation in food samples showed satisfactory value for re-covery, detection limits and standard deviation. Therefore, it can be recommended as suitable procedure for routine analysis of heavy metals in variety food matrices.ReferencesKenneth, O., 2014.

Macedonia* suzanaangelova@yahoo.comIntroductionAflatoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced mostly by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Among them, aflatoxin B1 exhibits the highest toxicity and carcinogenetic and it can be found in many commodities (groundnuts, nuts, cereals and their products, dried fruits, herbs) (Soleimany et al., 2012). The International Agen-cy for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified naturally oc-curring aflatoxin B1 as carcinogenic to humans - Group 1. Total aflatoxin content in food is regulated by legis-lation worldwide - Commission Regulation 466/2001, 2174/2003 and 1881/2006.  Our country has adopted the EU regulations since December 2005 - 118/2005. Different analytical methods are used for aflatoxins analysis. The HPLC methods for mycotoxin analysis have gained more attention due to their efficiency and high sen-sitivity, especially when fluorescence detection is used since it provides high selectivity, low LOQ and accurate analysis. Since only the aflatoxins B2 and G2 show natu-ral fluorescence, B1 and G1 must be derivatized prior to de-tection. This can be done photo chemically using irradia-tion with UV light at 254 nm. The aflatoxins B1 and G1 are thus hydroxylated, leading to stable and measureable fluo-rescence (Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez \u2013Vea et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2007). Very important aspect concerning mycotoxin analysis is sample preparation and clean-up procedure.  Application of immu-noaffinity column (IAC) provides clean extracts due to the specificity of the antibody, applicability to complex matri-ces, good precision, accuracy and sensitivity of analytical methods (Scott et al., 1997).  The aim of this article was determination of B1 affla-toxin and total aflatoxins in some foodstuffs collected from local supermarkets, using immunoaffinity column clean-up procedure and liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.Materials and methodsChemicalsHPLC grade reagents (methanol, acetonitril, water) and chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).  For clean-up purification immunoaffinity col-umns Afla-OtaCLEAN LCTech, Germany was used. Afla-toxins mix from Supelco, with concentrations of B1 1.026 \u00b5g/ml, B2 0.311 \u00b5g/ml, G1 1.046 \u00b5g/ml and G2 0.322 \u00b5g/ml were used as standards.SamplesMany different commodities, cereal samples and their products (94), nuts (17), dried fruits (55), spices (33) and sunflowers seeds (12) were brought to our laboratory by border health inspectors or food operators during 2015 year.The samples were kept in their original packages in dark, dry and cool place before analyzed.Sample preparationThe extraction and purification of aflatoxins was per-formed according to LCTech sample extraction and clean-up procedure. According to the matrix, the appropriate method was selected. For non fatty matrices e.g. wheat and maize, 20 g of sample was extracted with 100 ml metha-nol: water (8:2 V/V) in a blender jar at a high speed for five minutes. For fatty matrices (nuts, paprika, and chilli) as well as for spices (black pepper, coriander, cumin, ginger), 20 g of tested samples with addition of 2 g NaCl, was ex-S3 PP 136292Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 291 - 292 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationstracted with 100 ml methanol: water (8:2 V/V) and 50 ml of n-hexane. The mixture was filtered through a fluted fil-ter paper or centrifuged. The purified extract (14 ml) was added to an 86 ml PBS buffer (pH 7.2) and filtered again through 0.2 \u00b5m microfiber filter paper. 50 ml of the sec-ond filtrate (for spices maximum 14 ml) was quantitative-ly passed through the immunoaffinity column. The column was washed with 10 ml of water. Then, eluted with at 2 ml of methanol and measured directly by HPLC (ISO 16050, 2012).HPLC conditions HPLC analysis was performed with Agilent Technol-ogies 1260 Series chromatographic system equipped with vacuum degasser G4225A, Binary Pump G1312B, Auto sampler G1329E, Column Compartment G1316C. Fluores-cence Detector G1321B and UVE System for Photochem-ical derivatization LC Tech The UVE\u2122 (LCTech, Germa-ny).  Post-column photochemical derivatization was used to increase the sensitivity of detection of Aflatoxins B1 and G1. Aflatoxins were separated on ZORBAX Eclipse plus C18 Column 4.6 x 100 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m at room temperature. The mobile phase was a mixture of water:acetonitril:methanol (63:11:26, V/V/V).  The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the in-jection volume was 10 \u00b5l. The detection was carried out at and data were acquired using Agilent life Sciences Open-LAB CDS ChemStation software.MethodsThe limit of detection (LOD) was 3:1, calculated as S/N. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 10: 1, S/N. Re-covery, as a part of method performance evaluation, was determined according to the method of standard addition. Repeatability was estimated for B1 and B2, based on stan-dard deviation and relative standard deviation, using the data from the QC sample analyses.Results and discussionThree-point calibration curves were linear in the pro-posed concentration range for all four aflatoxins and they had satisfactory coefficient of correlation (R2) in the range of 0.9991- 0.9996.Limits of detection were in the range 3 - 8 \u00b5g/kg for all four aflatoxins and limits of quantification were in the range of 9 \u2013 23 \u00b5g/kg.The following fortified concentration levels were ap-plied: for B1 (5.0 \u00b5g/kg), for B2 (1.5 \u00b5g/kg), for G1 (5.0 \u00b5g/kg), for G2 (1.5 \u00b5g/kg), using an aflatoxin-free Trilo-gy reference material. For B1 the recovery was 93.93%, for B2 92.14%, for G1 100.96% and for G2 the recovery was 78.87%. Repeatability was 0.16% for B1 and 3.7% for B2.Laboratory for toxicological chemistry at PHI Cen-ter for Public Health Kumanovo took part in FAPAS Food Chemistry proficiency Test 04238 Aflatoxins B and G in Maize. Proficiency testing aims to provide an independent assessment of the competence of participating laboratories and is an essential element of laboratory quality assurance. The performance of the laboratory is shown with z-scores results (-2 \u2264 z \u2264 2).  Z- scores  results for B1 was  - 0.8, for B2 -1.1, for G1 -0.5, for G2  -1.5 and 0.9 for total aflatoxins. They were statistical satisfactory.Most of the cereals, nuts and dried fruits samples are below LOD. Two samples of red pepper powder had 1.486 ng/g and 1.612 ng/g total aflatoxins, respectively, which was below the permitted MRL of 10.0 ng/g. Four samples of sunflowers seeds had 28.7 ng/g, 19.4 ng/g/ 22.6 ng/g and 8.3 ng/g total aflatoxins, respectively.  The values exceed-ing the maximum permissible limits of 4 ng/g set by na-tional regulative.ConclusionLiquid chromatography linked to fluorescence detec-tion (HPLC/FD) and system for photochemical derivatiza-tion is suitable for routine analysis of aflatoxins in many commodities. Limits of quantification, precision, and re-covery were satisfactory allowing it to be used also as a method for aflatoxins confirmatory analysis.

Cyril and Methodius University,  1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* ecilku@yahoo.comIntroductionBiochemical reactions in the body generate reactive oxygen species, which can damage important bio-mol-ecules, leading to several disease conditions (Bhatt and Negi, 2012). Antioxidants are compounds which have the ability to trap the free radicals. In recent years, the interest in finding naturally occurring antioxidants has increased considerably for use in foods or medicinal materials to re-place synthetic antioxidants, which are being restricted due to their carcinogenicity (Zheng and Wang, 2001). Majority of the antioxidants from plants are secondary metabolites like phenolic and flavonoids that have been reported to be potent free radical scavengers (Baba and Malik, 2014). Resistance to available antibiotics is increasing at a very alarming stage globally. The antibacterial activity of plants is continuously attracting global attention. Plants, as the source of medicine, have been playing an impor-tant role in the health services around the world (Subedi et al., 2012). All crude extracts from plants represent a valu-able source of antioxidant and antibacterial agents, as well (Hossain et al., 2014). Recently, there have been great efforts to find safe and potent natural antioxidants and antibacterial agents from various plant sources. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant and antibac-terial activity of ethanol extracts of leaves of Betula pendu-la L., Tusilago farfara L., Plantago major L., Urtica dioi-ca L., Rosmarinus  officinalis L. and Melissa officinalis L.Materials and methodsDried leaves of Betula pendula L., Tusilago farfara L., Plantago major L., Urtica dioica L., Rosmarinus officina-lis L. and Melissa officinalis L. were purchased from the botanical departments of Macedonian manufacturers.The crude extracts were prepared by extraction of grounded dried leaves of plants with ethanol. The total phenolic content was quantified by Folin-Ciocalteu meth-od and was expressed as Gallic acid equivalents (GAE), milligram\u2019s per 1 gram of dry weight. The total flavonoids content was quantified by Aluminum chloride method, which was expressed as milligrams of quercetin equiva-lents (QE) per gram of dry extracts.  In vitro antioxidant ac-tivity was carried out by DPPH assay and expressed as IC50 (Gyamfi et al., 1999). The antibacterial activity was car-ried out by well diffusion method. This activity was quali-tatively assessed by presence or absence of inhibition zone (Perez et al., 1999).Results and discussionThe total phenolic content was ranged as fol-lowed: Melissa officinalis L.(181.98\u00b10.6016 GAE mg/g)>Rosmarinus officinalis L. (179.03\u00b10.4171 GAE mg/g)>Tusilago farfara L.(169.59\u00b10.5840 GAE mg/g)>Betula pendula L. (169.12\u00b10.0834 GAE mg/g)>Plantago ma-jor L. (128.9\u00b10.8343 GAE mg/g)>Urtica dioica L. (70.71\u00b10.6516 GAE mg/g). The total flavonoid con-tent was 154.52\u00b12.5534 QE mg/g, 115.13\u00b10.1178 QE mg/g,142.3\u00b15.0675 QE mg/g, 58.47\u00b10.6123 QE mg/g, S3 PP 137294Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 293 - 294 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentations75.97\u00b10.4249 QE mg/g and 25.63\u00b11.0606 QE mg/g, re-spectively. Ranking based on the antioxidant activity was: Melissa officinalis L. (2.6 \u00b5g/ml)>Rosmarinus offi-cinalis L. (78.58 \u00b5g/ml)>Tusilago farfara L. (140.9 \u00b5g/ml)>Betula pendula L. (244.45 \u00b5g/ml)>Plantago major L. (295.9 \u00b5g/ml)>Urtica dioica L. (458.7 \u00b5g/ml).Sensitivity of test strains, in decreasing order, was as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027>Entero-coccus faecalis ATCC 19433>Escherichia coli   ATCC 25922 >Escherichia coli   ATCC 8739 >Klebsiella pneu-moniae  ATCC 700603>Staphylococcus aureus  ATCC 25923.Melissa officinalis L. showed the highest total pheno-lic and flavonoids content and the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity, followed by Rosmarinus officinalis L. and Tusilago farfara L. It  is known that phenolic com-pounds in plant extracts contribute significantly to their an-tioxidant potential because of their unique structure (Bhatt and Negi, 2012). Betula pendula L. showed moderate anti-oxidant properties beside the high phenolic content. Plan-tago major L. showed moderate antioxidant properties. Urtica dioica L. showed the lowest total phenolic and fla-vonoids content and the weakest DPPH radical scaveng-ing activity.According to the results of antimicrobial screening, Rosmarinus officinalis L. showed strong antibacterial ac-tivity against all six bacterial stains. Tusilago farfara L., showed strong antibacterial activity towards the investigat-ed bacteria except the weak antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli   ATCC 8739 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603. Betula pendula L. has been shown to pos-sess the strongest antimicrobial activities against Entero-coccus faecalis ATCC 19433 and Pseudomonus aerugino-sa ATCC 9027. Plantago major L. and Urtica dioica L. ex-hibited strong antimicrobial activity towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, weak activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 700603. Melissa officinalis L. shows moderate antibacterial activi-ty against gram (+) bacteria and very weak or no activity against gram (-) bacteria.ConclusionThe results indicated that all of the plant extracts test-ed in this study could be considered promising antioxidant sources and great potential as antibacterial compounds against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.ReferencesBaba, S.A., Malik, S.A., 2014.

Macedonia* darinka.gorgieva@ugd.edu.mkIntroductionDuring the intensive research in past decades, the sci-entific community and regulatory agencies also, focused their interest on measuring contaminant levels in tissues and environmental samples and on understanding the mechanisms of toxicity of different and pervasive contam-inants. Among them, metals were always in focus because of possible detrimental and long lasting effects on living organisms (Gjorgieva et al., 2011; Stafilov et al., 2010). DNA damage and genotoxic stress are important param-eters that are followed in a case of chemicals exposition as an indication of carcinogenicity (Aydin et al., 2015; Kekec et al., 2010; Villatoro-Pulido et al., 2013). Plants are unique systems in their ability to serve as in situ monitors for environmental genotoxins. Molecular assays related to DNA-based techniques, like Random Amplified Polymor-phic DNA (RAPD), are very sensitive method of screening for nucleotide sequence polymorphisms that are random-ly distributed throughout the investigated genome (Gjor-gieva et al., 2012). The current study was designed to assess the effects of long term, high metal exposition (cadmium, lead, copper, nickel and zinc) on DNA damage. Materials and methodsFour different plants [Taraxacum officinale (Astera-ceae), Matricaria recutita L. (Asteraceae), Robinia pseu-doacacia L. (Fabaceae), and Urtica dioica (Urticaceae)] were chosen as model systems for genotoxicity assessment in a case of metal stressors. Plant samples were collected from two different areas, metal polluted (area around city of Veles, known for its lead and zinc industrial activity in the nearest past) and referent area (without metal exposi-tion, Pla\u010dkovica Mountain). Element analysis (analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma \u2013 Atomic Emission Spectrom-eter (ICP-AES)), DNA extraction (frozen plant samples were used for DNA isolation by using REDExtract-N-Amp Plant PCR Kit (Sigma-Aldrich)) and RAPD-PCR analysis were performed with samples included in this study. Am-plifications were performed in a DNA thermo cycler ac-cording to protocol of Enan, 2006. Seven different primers (with 60-70% GC content) were used. Sequences (5\u2019\u21923\u2019) from Primer 1 to 7 were: Primer 1 - GGTGCGGGAA; Primer 2 \u2013 GTTTCGCTCC; Primer 3 \u2013 GTAGACCCGT; Primer 4 \u2013 AAGAGCCCGT; Primer 5 \u2013 AACGCGCAAC; Primer 6 \u2013 CCCGTCAGCA; Primer 7 - GGCACTGAGG. All amplifications were repeated twice in order to confirm the reproducible amplification of scored fragments. Only reproducible and clear bands were scored for the construc-tion of the data matrix.Results and discussionRAPD technique was used to quantify DNA sequence changes. Agarose-gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from all samples, revealed total of 37 bands with different molecular weights ranging from 1250 to 5000 bp. It gener-ated distinctive polymorphism value of 72.97% (27 bands) total in four plant species investigated. Polymorphism in the RAPD profiles is scored as the presence or absence S3 PP 138296Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 295 - 296 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsof DNA bands in comparison to the control. The numer-ical analysis based on the banding pattern obtained from the samples exposed to metals was compared with that of the control sample via hierarchical cluster analysis. RAPD profiles generated by samples exposed to metals were dif-ferent from those obtained using control DNA. Samples which were close to the pollution source (high metal-expo-sition area) showed considerable polymorphism. The diag-nostic analysis (considering band intensity differences or the disappearance and/or appearance of RAPD bands) and the phenetic numerical analysis are important parameters in the RAPD method (Bhaduri and Fulekar, 2015; Gjor-gieva et al., 2012; Zhiyi and Haowen, 2004). Amplifica-tion with primer 1 and primer 2 yielded not enough signif-icant polymorphism, so we find that this primer sequenc-es are not suitable for fingerprinting genome of this four plant species. When amplification is performed with prim-er 3 and 5, the highest number of new bands is obtained (9 and 8 bands, respectively), with exception of primer 5 for T. officinale, where probably there is no suitable se-quence in the genome of this plant for annealing of above mentioned primer. The dendrogram constructed using NT-SYSpc programme (Rohlf, 1994) is statistical presenta-tion of the obtained date and showed that there is group-ing in separate clusters of the same plant species collect-ed from two different areas, according to modifications in the RAPD \u201cfingerprints\u201d following metal exposure. In ac-cordance with literature data that considered concentration of 40 mg L-1 of lead and 30 mg L-1 of cadmium (Aydin et al., 2013; Aydin et al., 2015) as the point of maximum appearance and disappearance of new bands in RAPD as-say, we assume that high metal content in all samples from Veles area, determined in present study, was directly in-volved in DNA damage detected which can lead to initia-tion of mutations.ConclusionRAPD assay is a valuable tool to evaluate the effects of toxicants on organisms under optimized conditions and for genotoxicity studies. RAPD markers can be used as di-agnostic markers. In this regard, induction of DNA band changes with one kind of a stressor (found in areas with metal pollution) might provide evidence of its genotoxic potential.

The limited ther-apeutic effects of the traditional treatments and their nu-merous side effects which compromise patients\u2019 compli-ance, urge the need for development of new medicinal an-ticancer agents. Therefore, numerous new research studies have been directed towards development of more specific targeted therapy.The most common reason for mortality among cancer patients is the tumor progression and formation of metasta-sis within organs distant to the location of the primary tu-mor. The purpose of this paper is to review the most rele-vant biomolecular factors that enable the metastatic pro-cess, and their potential for employment as targets for fu-ture development of new therapeutic anticancer agents. AngiogenesisThe access to the host\u2019s vascular system and the de-velopment of a blood network around and within the tu-mor, a process known as angiogenesis, is of crucial impor-tance for tumor\u2019s supply with oxygen and nutritional sub-stances and subsequent increase of the tumor mass, inva-sion and cancer dissemination. A lot of experimental and clinical data evidence that tumors can\u2019t grow beyond a di-ameter of 2-3 mm until the blood network is created, i.e. they can\u2019t progress until they acquire angiogenic ability. Hence, it has been proposed that the inhibition of angio-genesis could suppress the tumor\u2019s growth and its targeting has an important clinical validity for development of new approaches for cancer treatment.The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor(VEGFR) have major roles in the process of an-giogenesis and they can often be overexpressed in tumor-ous cells. Having in regard the role of VEGF as a potent angiogenic factor, many therapeutic strategies that target the angiogenesis via inhibition of VEGF signal pathway have been developed. These therapeutic strategies include use of: small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of VEGF receptors, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against VEGF or its receptor, soluble VEGF receptors which act as VEGF traps and ribozymes which specifically target VEGF mRNA (Cardones and Banez, 2006).Other important biochemical mediators are the fibro-blast growth factors (FGFs), which belong to the family of heparin binding proteins. The fibroblast growth factors and their receptors participate in the proliferation and migra-tion of endothelial cells, production of proteases and an-giogenesis. Recent studies show that FGFs synergize with VEGF during neovascularization and that FGFs could be involved in the mechanism for resistance towards anti-VEGF agents. Therefore, the new plausible therapeutic ap-proaches are focused either on the combined or the con-secutive inhibition of these two crucial angiogenetic signal pathways (Lieu et al., 2011).Angiopoietins are growth factors that also participate in the formation of blood vessels in several tumor types. Angiopoietin-1 and -2 are the best characterized cyto-kines which accomplish their biological function by bind-ing to the Tie-2 receptor. Angiopoietin-1 enables survival of endothelial cells, formation and stabilization of the vas-cular network. On the other hand, the positive regulation S3 PP 139298Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 297 - 298 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsof angiopoietin-2 disrupts the interaction between angio-poietin-1 with its receptor leading to destabilization of the blood vessels and subsequent enabling of VEGF-inducted angiogenesis. Because of this, the targeting of angiopoet-in-2 has a promising potential for cancer treatment. A nov-el therapeutic strategy involves development of agents that target the angiopoietin/Tie-2 signaling pathway. The first such agent which has reached advanced stages of clinical trials is AMG-386. AMG-386 is an anti-angiopoietin pepti-body which inhibits the interaction between the ligands an-giopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 with Tie-2 receptor (Neal and Wakelee, 2010).Cell detachment and extracellular matrix degradationApart from its relation to the angiogenesis, the acquisi-tion of metastatic potential is also related to the detachment of the malignant cell from the primary tumor and degrada-tion of proteins which comprise the surrounding extracel-lular matrix (ECM). The loss of cell-cell adhesion capacity enables the malignant cells to dissociate from the primary tumor, while the changes in the cell-matrix interaction en-able the cells to invade the surrounding stroma and dissem-inate. The most important adhesive molecules which have been considered as potential therapeutic anticancer targets are E-cadherin and integrin. E-cadherin is type-1 transmembrane protein that me-diates the cell-cell interaction. The reduced expression of E-cadherin is associated with an increase of the metastatic potential. One of the possible approaches for reduction of the invasive capacity of cancer cells implies enhancement of the inter-cell adhesive capacity through overexpression of E-cadherin.The integrins are surface receptors which mediate the cell-ECM interaction. The integrin\u2019s role in the metasta-sis of malignant cells, their localization on the cell\u2019s sur-face and sensitivity to a pharmacological blockade, makes them attractive for pharmacological targeting. Small mol-ecule integrin antagonists, including the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 inhibitor Cilengitide, have shown encouraging activity in controlling cell proliferation and metastasis. Beside from the small molecule antagonists, monoclonal antibodies against integrins, such as CNTO95, etaracizumab (MEDI-522), and volociximab are being subjected to clinical trials (Xiangming, 2015).ECM is composed of a thick network of proteins such as collagen and fibronectin. It must be invaded by the inva-sive cancer to enable itself space for migration. The most important proteolytic enzymes are the matrix metallopro-teinases (MMPs) which belong to the group of zinc-depen-dent endopeptidases. These enzymes have an important role in tumor invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis and are considered the major mediators of changes in the new microenvironment at the time of progression of the can-cer. As such, they are an attractive target for its treatment.The Epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway is a dynamic process that enables the polarized epithelial cells to lose the epithelial differentiation and acquire mesenchy-mal phenotype via numerous biochemical and morpho-logical changes. Thus, they gain higher migratory ability and Felicity\u2019s group suggests the Epithelial-mesenchymal transition pathway as promising target for development of therapeutic agents for prevention of tumor dissemination and metastasis (Felicity et al., 2014).ConclusionUnderstanding the biomolecular mechanisms under-lying the process of malignant progression and identifica-tion of the factors involved in this process should enable new therapeutic agents that would target the key molecu-lar pathways of cancer growth and dissemination to be de-veloped in future. In that way, selective action, higher effi-ciency and minimization of side effects of anticancer drugs would be accomplished.ReferencesCardones, A.R., Banez, L.L., 2006.

The inci-dence and prevalence of cancer are constantly increasing. It is presumed that by 2030 the annual number of newly di-agnosed cases will reach 23 600 000 which is an increase of 68% compared to the reported cases in 2012 (Bray et al., 2012). This fact points out the expansive tendency of cancer worldwide and emphasizes the need for dedicating higher attention both to prevention and treatment of this disease. The traditional methods for cancer treatment have lim-ited efficiency and high toxicity, exerting inevitable ag-gressiveness towards healthy tissues. Hence, medical prac-titioners and scientists are faced with the need for consider-ing the options of targeted action of the therapeutic agents and for focusing further research efforts on their develop-ment. The targeted therapy would be directed towards nor-malization of what is changed or cessation of some of the active cascades that initiate tumor development. There are already established molecular targets which can contribute to the inhibition of tumor\u2019s growth and restoration of nor-mal functions. The aim of this study is to review current-ly available data on the biomolecular processes involved in the early steps of cancer initiation and the possibility of their use as therapeutic targets in order to achieve maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity of the anticancer treatments.Cyclin and cyclin dependent kinasesCyclin and cyclin dependent kinases (CK/CDK) are responsible for the normal function and control over the cell cycle. They are check-up points which control the pos-sible irregularities during the cell cycle. It is known that, in certain tumors, the levels of CK/CDK are constitutive-ly increased, continuously encouraging the cell cycle and the creation of new cells. As such, CK/CDK are serious target candidates towards which new therapeutic agents can be directed in order to reduce their expression and nor-malize the cell division. Studies have been done on cyclin E which is important for controlling the cell cycle in G1 phase and its activation is important for postponing the ma-lignant processes. It is believed that the new medicaments should act at the level of inhibiting distinct phases of the cell cycle. Recently, several preclinical and phase I/II clin-ical studies have been conducted using a novel, reversible CDK4/6 inhibitor named Palbociclib. It was shown that Palbociclib has the role of CDK4/6 as a potential target in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers (Finn et al., 2016).Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genesThe activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressive genes have an important role in the process of malignant cell transformation. One of the cancer treatment modalities has the opposite goal. The suppression of the RAS-pathway is a significant target regarding the mech-anism of oncogene inactivation. This can be achieved by several mechanisms. One of them is disabling the bind-ing of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) to its receptor (EGFR), so that the dimerization of the intercellular part of the receptor, which associates with the adapter protein Son of Sevenless (SoS) and the receptor of the growth-binding protein 2 (Grb-2), is prevented. It is very important to at-tain this blockade, as the SoS-Grb-2 complex directly ac-S3 PP 140300Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 299 - 300 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationstivates the RAS-oncogene. RAS-induces intracellular cas-cade of kinases for promotion of proliferation. On the other hand, with activation of the RAS-oncogene, an activation of RAF-oncogene happens, which encourages RAF-Mito-gen-activated protein kinases and direct signals are sent to the core for starting cell division. The function of the RAS-oncogene is related to the proliferation, genetic expression, differentiation, emphasizing the cell survival and apopto-sis.  Because of the fact that RAF-MEK-ERK cascade is very complex and it is difficult to find RAF and MEK in-hibitors or inhibitors for RAS genes, the new strategies for inhibition of the RAS-oncogene are directed towards mu-tations of RNA and RAS-oncogene (Baines et al., 2011).A significant representative of the group of tyrosine kinases is the BCR-ABL oncogene. This oncogene is re-lated to the Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia. The kinase activity of BCR-ABL is the primary factor for stimulation of myeloid cells proliferation. As such, BCR-ABL oncogene is considered as a potential target, during treatment of chronically myeloid leukemia, for Imatinib, which inhibits both the ABL and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinas-es. However it was discovered that in some patients, white blood cells become resistant to Imatinib. One  newer ap-proach presents  BMS-354825  developed by Bristol-My-ers Squibb, that binds to the active form of ABL and over-comes 14 of 15 Imatinib-resistant mutants (Scholar et al., 2005)When it comes to the tumor suppressive genes, a meth-od should be developed for their activation in order to de-lay cell\u2019s growth and proliferation and to re-establish the processes of DNA reparation and apoptosis. The most studied gene is p53 which is also most frequently inacti-vated in cancer processes. Research directed towards new targets should take into consideration the suppression, the possible induction of p53 in normal, healthy cells, as well as the fact that increased levels of MDM2 are expected. The increased levels of MDM2 arise from the activation of p53 with its potential target and are expected to cause sup-pression of p53 as negative regulator (Wang et al., 2010).ApoptosisApoptosis is a genetically controlled form of cell death with a huge importance for physiological tissue remodel-ing during embryogenesis and maintaining homeostasis later in cell\u2019s life. The process of apoptosis is regulated via extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathways are activated through cell surface receptors such as the tu-mor-necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), death  receptors and the CD95/FAS/APO1 receptor. The intrinsic pathways are activated through intracellular stimuli caused by cytotoxic medicaments, hypoxia, DNA damage. These paths are es-pecially interesting for investigation as potential targets for anti-cancer agents. One of the possible targets are Smac peptidomimetics which act as mimetic agents but the poor pharmacokinetic properties prevents their clinical applica-tion (Elsayed et al., 2015).ConclusionThe above mentioned pathways involved in initia-tion and development of malignant neoplasm, as well as those which are to be identified in future, will have a sig-nificant contribution in the development of a suitable ther-apy for this disease, by specifically and selectively target-ing malignant cells and aberrant signaling pathways with-out harming the physiologically healthy cell processes.

The presence of H. pylori bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract is determined by different invasive and noninvasive diagnostic methods. The invasive  strategies are based on endoscopy which can be complemented by histology, urease test or tissue cul-ture to detect bacteria. Non-invasive tests include: anti-body tests (using serum, saliva or whole blood samples) which do not directly detect the presence of H. pylori but rather the presence of an immune response to H. pylo-ri in the form of antibodies. These antibodies may persist even after successful eradication. The antigen tests are per-formed on stool, saliva or urine samples, current interest focuses mainly on the stool antigen test for the detection of H. pylori antigens by an enzyme immunoassay technique. One of the recent advances regarding methodological ap-proaches for diagnosis and monitoring of patients with sus-pected gastric infection with  H. pylori is the urease test also termed urea breath test. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date com-prehensive review on the urea breath test as a noninva-sive method, its application and expansive usage for ear-ly detection of infections caused by the H. pylori bacteria, as well as prevention of other progressive illnesses by en-abling prompt eradication of the infection.Studies on the urea breath testThe urea breath test is an accurate, practical and read-ily available test which becomes known as a golden stan-dard when compared to other tests for identification and quantification of H. pylori. Being both specific and sensi-tive, the urea breath test is based on testing the expired air samples collected before and after ingestion of urea con-taining specifically labeled carbon. H. pylori bacteria pro-duce an enzyme called urease that converts urea into car-bon dioxide and ammonia. The carbon dioxide is excreted with the expired air from the lungs and the amount of the labeled carbon dioxide can be measured in the expired air sample, in order to determine the presence of the active H. pylori infection in the stomach and the level of the infec-tion. In order to postpone stomach draining during the ex-amination, a citric acid solution is consumed prior to the test. The lemon acid induces imminent relaxation of the gastric fundus as well as inhibition of the antral motility through biliary reflux. It has been reported that best results can be obtained with expired air samples collected within 10-15 minutes after the urea is consumed (Berger, 2002). The collected samples of expired air can be easily stored for a couple of days at different temperatures.A substantial number of research projects have studied the influence of several factors on the sensitivity and accu-racy of the test. The first studies were focused on the label-ing of the urea used in the breath test.Generally, two meth-ods are being used for labeling the urea-carbon, the first one uses a steady and heavy isotope 13C while the other one uses radioactive isotope 14C (Berger, 2002). It is also possi-ble to label the urea with both 13C and14C but this approach has relative strengths and flows. The radioactive 14C urea breath test can be performed only in hospitals that have nu-clear wards and for some patients a few attempts might be needed in order to produce sufficient amounts of CO2 to change the color of the solution. On the contrary, 13C urea breath test can be used in non-nuclear laboratory set-tings and the samples can be sent for mass spectrometry analysis elsewhere which is a great advantage in compari-S3 PP 141302Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 301 - 302 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsson with the radioactive 14C urea breath test. Furthermore, the small amount of expired air which is needed for analy-sis,  makes13C urea breath test ideal for usage (Desroches, 2001).  Even though the dose of 14C used in the urease test is very low, it is contraindicated for application in preg-nant women and small children.On the contrary, 13C \u2013 urea breath test can be used for the above mentioned groups of patients and is especially useful for testing the pediatric population (Jones et al., 2005).The hydrolysis of the 13C \u2013 labeled urea by H. pylori urease in the stomach produces13C02 which is then trans-ported to the lungs, whereby 13C in the expired air is re-vealed by the usage of special equipment. Currently sever-al types of equipment are suggested for evaluation of the 13C expired in air samples: Mass Spectrometry \u2013 Isotope Relationship (MSIR), non \u2013 dispersive isotope \u2013 selective IR spectroscopy (NDIRS) and laser analyzer equipment (LAE) (Parente et al., 2001).The influence of the amount of consumed urea on the accuracy of the urea breath tests has been extensively stud-ied and debated. The oldest tests were performed with 350 mg of urea, later the dose was decreased to 125 mg or 100mg and all tests turned out to be successful.Recent-ly, it was  suggested that 75 mg of urea might be sufficient for obtaining reliable results, but  later on, it has been con-firmed that an urea dose as low as 50 mg can be used for obtaining more precise urea breath test results.Urease \u2013 producing oropharyngeal bacteria can cause falsely positive results of the urea breath test. This problem has been solved by encapsulating the urea for its oral ad-ministration. Considering the advantages, the development of a capsular formulation with 13C urea is an outstanding progress and the most appreciated system for labeled urea delivery. A 50 mg capsule with 13C urea for detection of H. pylori in expired air manifests high sensitivity and distinc-tiveness in clinical conditions (Mattar et al., 2014). Several types of drug treatments are associated with falsely-negative results when using urea breath test. There-fore, antibiotics, bismuth concoctions and proton pump in-hibitors should not be taken within one month prior to the urea breath testing. Also, according to some studies H2\u2013 antagonists cause falsely-negative results if administered in high doses. This should be taken into consideration, es-pecially because patients are frequently treated with H2\u2013 antagonists before urea breath test is performed.ConclusionsThe UBT is based on the simple principle that a solu-tion of isotopically labelled urea is rapidly hydrolyzed by the abundantly expressed urease of H. pylori. The UBT is a non-invasive, simple and safe test, providing excellent accuracy both for the initial diagnosis of H. pylori infec-tion, confirmation of its eradication after treatment and pa-tients\u2019 follow-up. Although definitive standardization of the protocol for UBT isn\u2019t currently available, several recommendations could be suggested. It seems prudent to perform UBT in fasting conditions until new data definitively clarify this issue. Citric acid should be used as a test meal, amounts of 75 mg or even 50 mg of urea seem to be sufficient to perform highly accurate UBT. The test can be carried out by different types of equipment, such as IRMS, NDIRS or LAE with recommendation to collect and test two breath samples, one collected before and another collected 10\u201330 min after urea ingestion. Further studies should be per-formed to justify the cost-benefit ratio for routine applica-tion of this method in the biochemical laboratories.ReferencesBerger, A., 2002.

Macedonia2Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss.Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* suzanaangelova@yahoo.comIntroductionOchratoxin A (OTA) is the most common mycotox-in that can affect human health. The International Agen-cy for Research on cancer (IARC) classifies it as possi-bly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B). This mycotoxin is produced by toxigenic Aspergillus and Penicillium species (Pfohl-Leszkowicz et al., 2007). OTA has been extensive-ly documented as a contaminant of a wide variety of foods including cereals, green coffee, spices, nuts, dried fruits, beer, wine, grapes, and grape juice (Bell\u00ed et al., 2005). The target organ of OTA is the kidney. However, it has a wide range of other toxic effects, including hepatotoxicity, im-munotoxicity, teratogenicity and neuorotoxicity (Pfohl-Leszkowicz et al., 2007; Sava et al., 2006). Many countries and international organizations have regulated the OTA content in several commodities. The European Commission (EC) has enforced the limits of OTA in cereals and cereal products with the following lev-els: 5.0 ng/g for raw cereals grains, 3.0 ng/g for cereals and cereal products intended for human consumption, 0.5 ng/g for baby food and cereal- based food intended for young children.  For the dried vine fruits, soluble coffee and some dried fruits, the EC has set a maximal permissible limit for Ochratoxin A at 10.0 ng/g. Liquid chromatography linked to fluorescence detection (HPLC/FD) was extensively used for OTA confirmatory analysis (Ghali et al., 2009). The aim of this article was to determine concentration of OTA in some foodstuffs collected from supermarkets by liquid chromatography.Materials and methodsChemicals HPLC grade reagents (methanol, acetonitril, glacial acetic acid) and chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). For clean-up purification immuno-affinity columns Ochraprep (R-Biopharm Rhone, Glasgow, Scotland), were used. Ochratoxin A Trylogy, with concen-trations of 10.0 \u00b5g/ml in methanol was used as a standard.Commercially available Ochratoxin A, with concen-trations of 10.0 \u00b5g/ml in methanol, was used as a stock solution.  Ochratoxin A spiking solution contains 2.5 \u00b5g/ml Ochratoxin A and Ochratoxin A standard solution (0.25 \u00b5g/ml Ochratoxin A).  Ochratoxin A working solutions, in concentration ranging from 2.0 ng/ml to 10.0 ng/ml, were prepared by serial dilution of the standard solution.SamplesDuring 2015 year, 57 dried fruits samples including raisins (8), figs (8), dates (5), apricots (5), plumes (10), cranberries (3), cherries (3), pineapples (3), strawberries (2), goji (1), and papaya (1) were randomly collected from local supermarkets. Samples were stored in plastic bags at -200C until the analysis.Sample preparationTo ensure homogeneity before analysis, laboratory samples are normally slurred with water in the ratio of five parts fruit to four parts water, and test materials in this form were used.  A test portion, 45 g of fruit slurry, is extracted with a mixture of 50 ml methanol and 5 ml phosphoric acid solu-tion 0.1 mol/L. The extract is filtered, diluted with phos-S3 PP 142304Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 303 - 304 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsphate buffered saline, and applied into an immunoaffini-ty column containing antibodies specific for Ochratoxin A. The Ochratoxin A is isolated, purified and concentrated on the column and then released with elution solvent. Ochra-toxin A is quantified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detec-tion (MKC EN 15829:2011). HPLC conditionsHPLC analysis was performed with Agilent Technol-ogies 1260 Series chromatographic system equipped with vacuum degasser G4225A, Binary Pump G1312B, Auto sampler G1329E, Column Compartment G1316C and Flu-orescence Detector G1321B.  Ochratoxin A was separated on ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 Column 4.6 x 100 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m at room temperature. The mobile phase was a mixture of water:acetonitril:glacial acetic acid (99:99:2, V/V/V). The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the injection volume was 10 \u00b5l. Total running time was four minutes. The detection was carried out at   and   Data were acquired using Agile-nt life Sciences Open LAB CDS ChemStation software.Results and discussionThe described analytical methods effectively separated the Ochratoxin A of all analyzed products.  It was observed that under these optimized chromatographic conditions, Ochratotoxin A eluted in less than 5 minutes. The retention time was 3.131 minutes. The calibration curve was set in the range from 2.0 to 10.0 ng/ml using four-point calibra-tion curve. The regression equation was y=0.02198191x +0.0013271 with R2 - 0.99988. The accuracy was 4.7%. The limit of quantification was 1 ng/g. The mean recovery for Ochratoxin A was 86.4%. Laboratory for toxicological chemistry at PHI Cen-ter for Public Health Kumanovo took part in FAPAS Food Chemistry proficiency Test 17150 Ochratoxin A in dried Vine Fruit. Proficiency testing aims to provide an indepen-dent assessment of the competence of participating labora-tories and it is an essential element of laboratory quality as-surance. The performance of the laboratory is shown with z-scores results (-2 \u2264 z \u2264 2).  The result for z-score was at satisfactory level of 1.8.Ochratoxin A was found in two of all analyzed prod-ucts. Two samples of raisins contain 2.01 ng/g and 1.89 ng/g, respectively. None of the samples exceeded maxi-mum permissible limits of 10 ng/g set by national regula-tive (Official Journal of the R Macedonia No.102/2013).ConclusionThe described method is suitable for routine analy-sis of Ochratoxin A in dried fruits. Limits of quantifica-tion, precision, and recovery were satisfactory. The benefit from short time analysis is not only in the increased sam-ple throughput, but also in dramatically decreased solvent consumption. Therefore, the liquid chromatography linked to fluorescence detection (HPLC/FD) was extensively used for OTA confirmatory analysis.

Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* blagicajovanova@hotmail.comIntroductionHerbal medicine has been used since ancient times for prevention and treatment of numerous diseases. Different cultures utilize numerous plant species which are usually characteristic for the geographical region where they are natively growing. The repeated use of herbal preparations for various purposes is commonly based on the positive ex-perience and the beneficial outcome of their usage as part of traditional medicine of the population.According to the World Health Organization statistics, 80% of the population relies on traditional herbal medicine as a primary healthcare system. Furthermore, more than 50% of the population in developed countries such as Ger-many (90%), France (75%) and Canada (70%) has at least once in their lifetime relied on herbal products as a pri-mary treatment. Beside the common practice of tradition-al herbal medicine, commercially available herbal products are also widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular dis-eases, allergies, asthma, arthritis and many other diseas-es. On the other hand, the increasing usage of herbal prod-ucts is becoming major concern of health regulatory bodies and the general public, mainly because of the high avail-ability of the herbal products on the market (Ekor, 2014). Moreover, a great portion of these products are classified as food or dietary supplements in some countries, making them easily accessible for the general public. The common perception of herbal products being generally safe regard-less of the administered dose is often misleading. There-fore, toxicity evaluation of commercially available herbal products is mandatory, considering the possibility of using their toxic potential in cytotoxicity studies.Materials and methodsPlant samples of 9 different species were tested for their toxic potential: 2 samples of bark (Rhamnus fran-gula and Quercus pedunculata), and 7 samples of whole herbal parts (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Epilobium parviflo-rum, Hypericum perforatum, Polygonum aviculare, Teu-crium chamaedrys, Viscum album and Galega officinalis).These samples are commercially available as one-com-ponent herbal teas and are commonly used for the treat-ment of various pathological conditions. The tested plant samples were prepared as methanol extracts, lyophilized, freeze dried and later reconstituted with DMSO (dimeth-yl sulfoxide). For the evaluation of potential toxicity among the selected herbal teas, the Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay (BSLA) was the most suitable method. BSLA is based on counting dead Artemia salina nauplii after their exposure to plant extracts in a certain time frame. The most relevant time period for the determination of LC50 is after 24 hours. After this period, dead nauplii were counted and the mor-tality of Artemia salina was calculated and expressed for each concentration of tested plant extract. The obtained re-sults for the mortality of the brine shrimps were further an-alyzed with regression analysis and LC50 values were ob-tained by application of probit regression analysis. Results and discussionAccording to the obtained LC50 values for the tested methanol extracts, the toxicological bioactivity is decreas-ing in the following order: Polygonum aviculare > Teu-crium chamaedrys > Capsella bursa-pastoris > Epilobi-um parviflorum > Galega officinalis > Rhamnus frangu-la > Quercus pedunculata > Hypericum perforatum > Vis-cum album.S3 PP 143306Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 305 - 306 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsOut of the tested plant samples, highest toxic potential manifested Polygonum aviculare (LC50 185 \u00b5g/mL) and the lowest toxic potential was obtained for Viscum album (LC50 590 \u00b5g/mL). The classification of the samples was done according to 2 scales: Meyer\u2019s scale and Clarkson\u2019s scale (Meyer at al., 1982; Clarkson et al., 2004). Meyer\u2019s scale classifies plant samples as toxic (LC50< 1000 \u00b5g/mL) and non-toxic (LC50> 1000 \u00b5g/mL). Clarkson\u2019s scale clas-sifies plant samples in several subcategories: plant samples with high (0 - 100 \u00b5g/mL), medium (100 \u2013 500 \u00b5g/mL), low (500 \u2013 1000 \u00b5g/mL) and no toxic potential (>1000 \u00b5g/mL). All tested samples were classified as toxic accord-ing to both scales, since the obtained LC50 values for each sample is below 1000 \u00b5g/mL. However, the tested plant extracts manifested a different level of toxicity. In accor-dance with the Clarkson\u2019s scale, Viscum album was clas-sified as a plant sample with low toxic potential, while the rest were classified as plant samples with medium toxic potential. The obtained results for the toxic potential of the selected herbs are in accordance with the literature re-sults. Thus, the anticancer effects of Polygonum aviculare were investigated against MCF-7 cells (human breast can-cer cell line). It has been shown that the methanol extract of Polygonum aviculare induced cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cell line, which confirmed the cytotoxic (anticancer) potential of this plant species (Habibi Roudkenar et al, 2011). Fur-thermore, the cytotoxic potential of the methanol extract of Teucrium chamaedrys against HCT-116 cells (human co-lon carcinoma cells) was evaluated. The obtained results have shown that Teucrium chamaedrys exhibited a signif-icant cytotoxic activity against the HCT-116 cells after 24 hour exposure (Stankovic et al., 2011).ConclusionAll tested herbal teas manifested medium toxic poten-tial, except for Viscum album which manifested low toxic potential according to Clarkson\u2019s scale of toxicity, but the mechanism and origin of this activity need to be further ex-amined and clarified. The Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay is a reliable preliminary tool to evaluate the toxic potential of plant samples. This is also supported by the good cor-relation between BSLA and other in vivo toxicity models. Therefore, the Brine Shrimp Lethality Assay is a conve-nient approach for a pre-selection of promising toxic plant samples that could further be examined for their cytotoxic potential in a more detailed research.

The aim of this study is to summarize the current extensive knowledge of the met-abolic aberrations in cancer and propose plausible mole-cules and pathways that could be targeted for specific treat-ment of this disease.Key concepts and clinical potential of the Warburg effectThe important discovery that highlighted the area of cancer metabolism is the Warburg effect, an  anti-physio-logical way for energy generation used by the cancer cells for their proliferation. This effect explains the alteration of the normal process of oxidative phosphorylation follow-ing the process of glycolysis and excessive lactate produc-tion despite adequate oxygenation of the tissue, provid-ing an acidic environment that encourages the prolifera-tion and tumor invasion. Several studies have contribut-ed to the discovery of key biochemical pathways and their regulators, which can shed light on the field of cancer me-tabolism and can serve as new targets for cancer therapy (Semenza, 2011). One of the main metabolic features of all cancer cells is an increased utilization of glucose that offers several ad-vantages: the survival in an environment with unstable ox-ygen concentration which is otherwise fatal to normal cells referring predominantly  to the oxidative phosphorylation as a source of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), secondly the production of lactate as an end product of aerobic glycol-ysis makes acidic environment, which favors invasion of cancer and also suppresses the activity of anti-cancer im-mune effectors. Additionally, cancer cells utilize glycolyt-ic intermediates for anabolic reactions necessary for rapid proliferation, and, finally, the production of pyruvate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), the two main products of glycolysis and the pentose phos-phate cycle, are used by the cancer cells in order to deal with oxidative stress. Pyruvate catches hyperoxides while NADPH participates in the glutathione peroxidase medi-ated destruction of hydrogen peroxide (Singleterry et al., 2014). The essential role of glycolysis as a necessary process for cell proliferation is based on the fact that this process provides compounds with hydrocarbon skeleton, which are required for the biosynthesis of various biomolecules such as nucleic, amino and fatty acids. In spite of the fact that the process of oxidative phosphorylation provides greater amounts of ATP, the process of glycolysis is a much faster process of energy supply, and therefore is a more appropri-ate process to meet the large energy needs of cancer cells during active division. There are various types of deviation regarding the process of oxidative phosphorylation and ac-tivation of glycolysis used by cancer cells. One of them is activation of the enzyme phosphofructokinase, a key en-zyme for the process of glycolysis, by reduced produc-tion of ATP. Another approach implies changing the pH of the environment by reactive oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide. These radicals are known to cause intracellular alkalization which can activate the enzyme and thereby in-duce the process of glycolysis. Additionally, hydrogen per-oxide can also activate HIF 1 and the oncogenic RAS, SRC and MYC that are involved in the expression of enzymes and transporters participating in the process of glycolysis. Another major catabolic way that links the glucose metabolism to nucleotide biosynthesis and production of NADPH is the pentose-phosphate cycle. This process is necessary for the antioxidative surveillance and reduc-S3 PP 144308Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 307 - 308 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationstive biosynthesis. It is controlled by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate- dehydrogenase (G6PD), which activity is mediated by several signals and it serves as a sensor for the cellular NADP+ level. As glycolysis has a crucial role in the development of cancer, the Warburg effect can be used for therapeutic tar-geting of cancer metabolism. One approach is inhibition of the glycolytic enzymes involved in certain limiting steps of glycolysis, such as hexokinase 2 which ionizes the molecule of glucose and as such is retained inside the cell. A mole-cule that affects this enzyme is 2 deoxyglucose, a competi-tive inhibitor that cooperates with glucose for the active site of hexokinase 2, whereby with phosphorylation, this com-pound can\u2019t be further metabolized and accumulated inside the cell. The activity of the enzyme phosphofructokinase is also a potential target. The fact that this enzyme is very sen-sitive to small changes in pH and its action is induced by high pH values, the inactivation of the Na/H+ pump NHE1 which excretes H+ ions from the cell, may lead to decreased intracellular pH, decreased activity of phosphofructokinase and inhibition of the process of glycolysis, endangering the survival of cancer cells. Molecules that inhibit the activi-ty of the Na/H+ pump NHE1 are amiloride and 5,5-dimeti-lamiloride. Lactate dehydrogenase is another enzyme that contributes for the Warburg effect which may serve as a tar-get for aerobic glycolysis in the heart.Another approach for reducing the glycolysis level in cancer cells is by inhibiting the synthesis of glucose trans-porters and glycolytic enzymes. HIF1 is a transcription fac-tor that controls the activity and its inhibition is assessed in multiple studies. As a result, several Food and Drug Ad-ministration approved anticancer drugs such as topotecan, imatinib, celecoxib and ibuprofen have proven to inhibit the activity of this factor. The role of G6PD as an oncogene makes this enzyme a potential therapeutic target. Hense, the combination of oxythiamine and dehydroepiandros-terone, has an additive inhibitory effect over cancer cells. This indicates that the combinatory targeting of the pentose phosphate cycle and other metabolic pathways may be an effective approach to selective suppression of cell growth.Targeting the glutamine metabolismThe dependability of the cancer cells survival on the aerobic glycolysis solely has been discredited by research showing that glutamine metabolism is also essential for certain types of cancer. Recent studies demonstrate the vi-tal need for this amino acid, its buffering effect against ox-idative stress, the role of a mediator in intracellular sig-naling, and as a quality control of macromolecules and or-ganelles (Shanware et al., 2011). Crucial enzymes involved in the glutamine metabolism such as isocitrate dehydroge-nase, are found to be mutated in certain types of cancer, such as gliomas and acute myeloid leukemia, hense target-ing this enzyme may be an alternative  anti-cancer thera-py. Other two important enzymes that control the gluta-mine metabolism are glutamate dehydrogenase and gluta-mate aminotransferase. Glutamate dehydrogenase can be inhibited by a component of the green tea named epigal-locatechin-3-gallate, while the aminotransferase can be in-hibited by aminooxyacetate.There are various other potential factors that play an important role in maintaining the high glycolytic pheno-type of the cancerous tissue that can be used as potential targets such as: oxidative stress which causes apoptosis in cancer cells, transporters that facilitate the entry of glu-cose, the facilitated lactate efflux and the active transport of protons in the tumor microenvironment.ConclusionThe growing awareness of the difficulty for therapeu-tic targeting signal transduction in tumors, and the side ef-fects that accompany this approach, shift the therapeutic strategies towards targeting the aberrant tumor metabo-lism. Further research and discoveries in the field of cancer metabolism may lead to a better understanding of the dis-ease and enable development of efficient anti-cancer drugs.ReferencesSemenza, G.L., 2011.

They grow natively in Macedonia form-ing pure and mixed stands in subalpine forests (Ka\u0142ucka et al., 2013). The common used parts of the plant are root, stem, bark, branch, resin, tar, leaf, pollen, cone, seed, nee-dles (K\u0131z\u0131larslan and Sevg, 2013). They are used as antisep-tics, tonics, expectorants, analgesics, and especially in the treatment of respiratory (common cold, asthma, bronchitis) and urinary system disorders, skin diseases (wounds) and digestive system diseases. The bark and resin obtained from the Pinus trees are the primarily used parts of the plant, mainly because of the antimicrobial and antiseptic proper-ties. Additionally, diverse benefits have been claimed for pine needles as well, such as antibacterial, cholesterol low-ering, antioxidant and antitumorial effects.In this research, needles and bark of selected Pinus species were tested for their toxicological bioactivity, as a starting point for the selection of promising toxic agents that could be further investigated in more detailed studies of cytotoxicity.Materials and methodsNeedles and bark of Pinus peuce, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus nigra and Pinus mugo were collected at five different localities in the Republic of Macedonia: Pelister, Kozhuf, Karadzica, Berovo, Nidze. The plant material was harvest-ed in the year of 2008, 2009 and 2010. The collected plant materials weredried at room temperature for two weeks, and then milled to fine powder. A stock solution from each sample was prepared as a methanol extract, followed by lyophilization and freeze drying. The final extracts were prepared by reconstitution of the lyophilized powders with DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide). The toxicity of each plant extract was tested using the Brine Shrimp Lethality As-say (BSLA) (Meyer et al., 1982). The toxic potential was determined by counting the number of dead Artemiasali-nanauplii after 24 hours exposure to the tested plant ex-tracts. Furthermore, based on the calculated percentage of mortality of the brine shrimps, LC50 values were calculated using probit regression analysis (Finney, 1952). According to the obtained LC50values, the tested plant samples were classified using two scales of toxicity: Meyer\u2019s scale and Clarkson\u2019s scale (Clarkson et al., 2004; Meyer et al., 1982). Results and discussionThe obtained LC50values represent the toxic poten-tial of eachPinus species selected for toxicity testing in this research. According to the obtained data, every sam-ple of needles was classified as toxic according to Mey-er\u2019s scale and Clarkson\u2019s scale of toxicity. Pinuspeuce nee-dles collected from the locality of Pelister have the lowest LC50 value (LC5083 mg/mL). According to this result, it is classified as a sample with high toxic potential (0-100 mg/mL) using the Clarkson\u2019s scale of toxicity. The toxic bioac-tivityof the needles declines in the following order: Pinus peuce (Pelister)>Pinus mugo (Karadzica)>Pinus sylvestris S3 PP 145310Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 309 - 310 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentations(Kozhuf)>Pinus nigra (Kozhuf). Among the tested samples of bark, the highest tox-ic potential was detected for Pinus peuce collected from Nidze(LC50135 mg/mL) and was classified as a sam-ple with medium toxic potential (100-500 mg/mL) using Clarkson\u2019s scale.The results vary among the samplesand an important factor appears to be the locality of their ori-gin: the samples of bark collected from the locality of Ni-dze (Pinus peuce and Pinus sylvestris) manifested great-er toxicity compared to the same species collected from the localities of Berovo and Pelister. The toxic bioactivi-ty of the tested bark samples declines in the following or-der: Pinus peuce (Nidze) >Pinus sylvestris (Nidze) >Pinus sylvestris (Berovo) >Pinus peuce (Pelister) >Pinus nigra (Berovo).However, the prominent toxicity detected for the test-ed samples is probably a result of certain bioactive com-pounds with toxic characteristics that are naturally found in the selected Pinus species, since the samples were col-lected from localities which are characterized with a clean and healthy environment for plant growth. According to literature data, \u03b1-pinene is the dominant compound in most Pinus species. Additionally, this compound is a confirmed toxic agent (Leite et al., 2009), which suggests the origin of the toxic potential for the tested plant samples in this re-search.ConclusionAll tested Pinus needles and bark were classified as samples with a toxic potential according toMeyer\u2019s scale and Clarkson\u2019s scale. Moreover, Clarkson\u2019s scale classi-fied the examined samples in subcategories, according to which most of the tested extracts were samples with me-dium toxic potential. This gives a future perspective for further analysis of their cytotoxic potential and determi-nation of the components responsible for the toxic effects they manifest. Although BSLA cannot determine the com-pounds responsible for a toxic effect, it is still a useful tool for the selection of potential cytotoxic candidates based on the extent of toxicity they manifest against Artemia sali-na nauplii.

The organophosphates (OPs) or their active metabolites are electrophilic compounds with moderate to high potency for phosphorylating the serine hydroxyl group located in the active site of AChE. The reactivity of OP compounds varies depending upon the chemical struc-ture. OPs may also interact (inhibit) with other serine es-terases: neurotoxic esterase (NTE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), carboxylesterases (CarbE), phosphorylphospha-tases (A-esterases), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), arylformamidase (AFMID), acylpeptide hydrolase (APH) (Casida and Quistad, 2004). Materials and methodsIn order to explore cholinergic and non-cholinergic targets of OPs, literature review was undertaken. Results and discussionThe half-life of recovery of inhibited brain AChE is about 1 week (approximately 5% per day) in experimen-tal animals and is believed to be the same in man. BuChE activity takes approximately 4-6 weeks to return to pre-exposure levels whereas erythrocyte AChE requires 5-7 weeks. BuChE is generally more sensitive than AChE to OP esters. Some OPs (tri-o-cresyl phosphate, mipafox, lep-tophos) considered to be extremely potent to inhibit NTE producing organophosphate-induced delayed polyneurop-athy that is associated with inhibition of at least 70% of the activity sometimes followed by irreversible transformation to its non-reactivatable form.The endocannabinoid arachidonyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and the endogenous sleep-inducing agent oleamide are hydrolyzed by FAAH. Anandamide also binds to the CB1 receptor in brain that is the target for marijuana and its principal psychoactive ingredient \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol. Particularly potent inhibitors of FAAH in vivo in mice are chlorpyrifos and tribufos. The OPs may create a nicotinic acid deficiency by blocking its biosynthetic pathway. Tryptophan is the met-abolic precursor for N-formyl-L-kynurenine, L-kynuren-ine, nicotinic acid, NAD(H), and NADP(H) in mammals. AFMID (formerly known as kynurenine formamidase), the second enzyme in this pathway, is very sensitive in birds and mammals especially to OPs with nitrogen-containing hetero cyclic or aliphatic leaving groups (diazinon, diazox-on, monocrotophos). APH hydrolyses the N-terminal acetylated amino acid residue on peptides, thereby removing one form of pro-tection from proteolysis. It also hydrolyses oxidized pro-teins in human erythrocytes with a possible physiological function of removing oxidatively damaged components in cells. APH activity has been potently inhibited by chlorpy-rifosmethyl oxon, dichlorvos and diisopropyl fluorophos-phates with resultant IC50 values of 18.3, 118.7 and 22.5 nM, respectively. Malathion and malaoxon inhibit lysyl oxidase (LyO) (IC50 = 1-9 nM) as well as proline hydrox-ylase (IC50= 50-58 nM) in homogenates of Xenopus em-bryos, suggesting that they alter posttranslational modifi-cation of collagen with resultant morphological defects in S3 PP 146312Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 311 - 312 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsconnective tissue.Additionally, OPs may have a direct action on musca-rinic and nicotinic receptors, binding to (with high/low af-finity) and modulating the function of these receptors (as indicated by clinical effects). Specific binding of an OP compound to muscarinic receptors does not necessarily produce predictable effect (some OPs bind to muscarinic receptors and activate them, while others may bind to and inhibit the action of muscarinic receptors). OPs may bind to allosteric sites on nicotinic receptors stimulating recep-tor desensitization. The OP concentrations required to act directly on nicotinic receptors are much higher than those on muscarinic receptors, suggested that muscarinic recep-tors are more important as secondary targets in OP action. Cannabinoid system is also sensitive to OPs and their me-tabolites. Chlorpyrifos oxon is a potent in vitro inhibitor of cannabinoid CB1 receptor binding (IC50 = 14 nM) but is ef-fective in vivo only at near lethal levels. Combination of possible interactions will produce resultant toxic effect(s) for the certain OP. The spectrum of effects is modulated by various toxicokinetic factors. Exposure to OPs can induce four different clinical syn-dromes: 1. acute cholinergic crisis as a result of AChE inhi-bition (in CNS and PNS), 2. intermediate syndrome whose underlying mechanism(s) is still unclear(excessive stim-ulation of cholinergic receptors etc.), 3. organophosphate induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) that has been ex-plained by the inhibition of NTE, and 4. chronic organo-phosphate induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND) due to long-term low-level exposure (LTLL) (Antonijevi\u0107 and Stojiljkovi\u0107, 2007). Chronic exposure to OP substanc-es is a controversial area of toxicology: a number of au-thors propose that prolonged exposure at low levels of or-ganophosphates can produce adverse effects in man and in animals, while others have reported no such effects. Sever-al studies have reported long-term, persistent, chronic neu-rotoxicity symptoms in individuals as a result of acute ex-posure to high doses that cause acute cholinergic toxici-ty, or from long-term low-level, subclinical doses of these chemicals with or without previous history of acute epi-sode. Available data on neurotoxicity showed/suggest-ed that: animals treated chronically with OPs exhibit re-duced sensitivity (adaptive responses), probably due to down-regulation of ACh receptors and reduced synthesis of ACh, so that the presynaptic release is restricted; sub-lethal or subclinical doses of OPs  can produce apoptotic neuronal cell death and involve oxidative stress due to an increase of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate and subsequent increase in intracellular calcium; genetic sus-ceptibility (genetic variation in paraoxonase) could be re-lated to OPs neurotoxicity; inhibition of brain CarbE, the activity of which appears to be unrelated to the liver and plasma type, and/or even other non-target enzymes such as carboxyamidase, whose endogenous function is unknown although it has been suggested that it has a role in xenobi-otic metabolism, may play a role in explaining the mech-anism of cognitive dysfunction; behavioral changes could be induced by the effects of OP compounds on neuropep-tide metabolism due to inhibition of acylpeptide hydrolase, the enzyme which is responsible for the removal of N-acet-ylated amino acids from the N-terminus of short peptides.Several low dose studies as well as some epidemio-logical studies did not identify any link between neurolog-ical disorder and erythrocyte and/or plasma cholinesterase activity. The mechanisms of OPs \u2013 induced chronic neu-rotoxicity have yet to be established. An important conse-quence of this is that non-cholinergic mechanism can be expected to show different structure-activity relationship to those established for conventional end points such as acute toxicity (Vu\u010dini\u0107 at al., 2014).  ConclusionIn conclusion, based on the available data, their qual-ity and quantity, and the fact that inhibition of AChE is both the most specific and one of the most sensitive mecha-nism of OPs action, it seems that inhibition of AChE is still the most reliable parameter to predict absolute and relative potency with regard to long-term low-level exposure and neurodevelopmental toxicity produced by OPs.ReferencesCasida, J.E., Quistad, G.B., 2004.

Macedonia2Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University,Majka Tereza 47, 1000  Skopje, R. Macedonia* emilija.kostoska@filafarm.com.mkIntroductionAcute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a life-threaten-ing condition which diagnosis must be established right away and to be currently treated. Early identification and confirmation of acute myocardial infarction is quite impor-tant for the patient care and making the right decisions. The acute myocardial infarction belongs within the spectrum of acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina pec-toris, acute myocardial infarction without elevation of ST-segment (NSTEMI) and acute myocardial infarction with elevation of ST-segment (STEMI). Acute myocardial in-farction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide (Atman et al., 2000).Angina pectoris is the medical term for chest pain or discomfort caused when the heart muscle doesn\u2019t get enough oxygen-rich blood. But, angina is not a disease. It is a symptom of an underlying heart problem, usually coro-nary heart disease (CHD). There are many types of angina, including stable and unstable angina. In fact, unstable angi-na is a pre-infarction syndrome (Braunwald, 1990).Diagnosis on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is not an ab-solute criterion, particularly in the case of small infarctions. Cardiac markers are used in the diagnosis and risk stratifi-cation of patients with chest pain and suspected acute cor-onary syndrome (ACS) (Higgins et al., 1999). The mea-surement of cardiac markers in the blood is the basis of the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction for more than 50 years. The release of biomarkers in the bloodstream in higher than normal amounts, suggests a pathological pro-cess. Thus, the detection of elevated concentrations of car-diac biomarkers in the blood is a sign of cardiac injury that may be due to toxic effects or hemodynamic stress. Tradi-tional cardiac markers (CK-NAC, LDH) have many dis-advantages: they secrete into the circulation very late (12 hours after necrosis of the heart muscle), thus preventing the early diagnosis. To overcome this situation, for detec-tion of cardiac necrosis, there are introduced new biochem-ical markers from the circulation, CK-MB and troponin (Rajappa and Sharma, 2005).CK-MB rise twice higher than normal after 6 hours of the infarction, to reach its maximum after 24-48 hours, when its concentration decreases, therefore it can\u2019t be di-agnosed cardiac necrosis quickly. Troponin I appears in the serum relatively early after the infarction (approximately 4 hours), reaches its maximum 12-48 hours after necro-sis, and remains in the circulation up to 14 days later. The cardiac troponins, in particular, have become the cardiac markers of choice for patients with acute coronary syn-drome (Thygesen et al., 2010).The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical value of cardiac Troponin I over CK-MB as essential marker in early assessing myocardial cell damage.Materials and methodsBlood samples (serum and heparinized plasma) were taken from 38 patients (29 males and 9 females) with com-plain on chest pain at the Special Hospital for Surgical Dis-eases \u201cFilip Vtori\u201d Skopje. According to their age, the pa-tients were divided into 3 groups (from 31-50; 51-70 and over 70 years old) in order to prove which will be the most risk group in regards of cardiovascular diseases.Daily measurements of Troponin I and CK-MB levels were made in all patients with no history of coronary heart disease. Regardless the values, the measurements were re-S3 PP 147314Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 313 - 314 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationspeated every 4 hours in order to conceive the trend line of the markers. Also, on the receipt day of the patients, the ECG tests were made, respectively.Determination of these markers was made with Im-munoassay System \u2013Advia Centaur XP by of chemilumi-nometric immunoassay method. Minimum concentration limit (\u201ccut off\u201d value) for Troponin I is 0.78 ng/ml and the referent values for CK-MB are from 0-15 ng/ml. There-fore, any increase of the concentration of these markers, indicates the condition of acute myocardial infarction. If there is no increasing above the baseline value of Tropo-nin I and if ECG tests are normal, it\u2019s a question of angi-na pectoris.Results and discussionIn regards of age group, the obtained results indicated that the risk group in terms of cardiovascular diseases (in this case AMI) is the group from 51-70 years (29 patients).As expected, serum Troponin I levels increased in 30 from all 38 patients (79%). Thus, these increased concen-trations of cardiac troponin (cTnI) which deviate from nor-mal values, indicate of acute myocardial infarction. There-fore, 20 patients of them (67%) had elevation of ST-seg-ment (STEMI) on ECG test which can confirm the diagno-sis. There were no signs of myocardial infarction on ECG test (NSTEMI) on the rest 10 patients (33%), only the con-centration of Troponin I was elevated. In this case, Tropo-nin I is the leading biochemical parameter which affirms that these patients had AMI, which is very important.CK-MB was elevated only in 9 of the 38 patients and according to literature data (that this marker stays elevat-ed in the blood up to 72 hours), it appears in blood after 6-9 hours after the onset of chest pain, unlike the Tropo-nin which was already increased. Just to confirm the low-er sensitivity of CK-MB compared with Troponin I, when the second tests were made (after next 4 hours), only on 5 patients the concentration of CK-MB started to elevate. On the other side, the elevated CK-MB levels on those 9 pa-tients, appeared to be decreasing next day (the concentra-tions were in the referent values), unlike Troponin I which concentration was still over the \u201ccut off\u201d value.In the rest 8 patients (21%) the ECG findings were nor-mal and the results for Troponin were in the referent val-ues, which indicate that these patients were with angina pectoris. If their symptoms become worse over time, test for Troponin must be ordered, because it can lead to a heart attack.ConclusionCardiac Troponin I appears to be diagnostically superi-or to CK-MB due to its high sensitivity (appears very early after infarction) and specificity.Therefore, Troponin I is considered as \u201cgold standard\u201d in the early detection of myocardial infarction and is nec-essary in setting the correct diagnosis. Thus, the use of test for Troponin enables early noninvasive diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.ReferencesAntman, E.,Bassand, J.P., Klein, W.,Ohman, M., Lopez, S.

Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, Macedonia* bujaroska_m@yahoo.comIntroductionThe routine screening in the Laboratory of Forensic Toxicology encompasses assays for determination of psy-choactive substances, commonly used drugs and presence of ethanol. The positive finding on opiates does not always imply the presence of heroin (HER) and/or its metabo-lites because various drug formulations contain an opiate as an active substance. The detection of HER and its main metabolite 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) as a gener-al marker of HER use, poses some analytical challenges, mainly due to their short half-lives (Goldberger et al.,1994; Paterson and Cordero, 2006; Rook et al., 2006). The scope of this study includes 3 forensic cases with positive find-ings on opiates, where the presence of HER and 6-MAM could not be detected, but some additional markers of HER use were identified.Materials and methodsThe analyses which are subject of this study were con-ducted by routine screening for the presence of psychoac-tive substances, using fluorescence polarization immuno-assay and/or biochip array technology for urine and blood samples, respectively. The positive results were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), af-ter previous sample preparation using ion exchange solid phase extraction (SPE) columns. In the case of urine sam-ples, acid hydrolysis was performed prior to SPE, in order to determine free opioid alkaloids. ResultsCase 1: The routine screening of the postmortem urine samples did not show positive results for the presence of psychoactive substances. However, further analyses us-ing GC-MS were conducted due to the information on the presence of a syringe and an unknown powdered substance near the body of the deceased. The GC-MS analysis of the serum revealed the presence of the following substances: caffeine, morphine (MOR), acetaminophen and traces of noscapine, papaverine and hydrocodone. In the unknown powder sample and the syringe, acetaminophen, caffeine, codeine (COD), 6-MAM, papaverine, MOR and noscap-ine were detected.Case 2:  Positive results on the presence of opi-ates and methadone in postmortem blood and urine sam-ples were obtained during the routine screening. Further GC-MS analyses of the biological samples were conduct-ed and the following substances were identified in the se-rum: nicotine, cotinine, caffeine, theophylline, theobro-mine, paracetamol, methadone and its metabolite 2-ethyl-idene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), met-amizol, MOR, meconine and traces of COD. The same substances were identified in the urine sample, along with noscapine, hydrocotarnine and desmethylpapaverine.Case 3: Screening of postmortem urine samples showed positive finding on opiates, whereas postmortem blood screening showed presence of opiates, methadone, benzodiazepines and cannabinoids. The GC-MS analy-sis confirmed the presence of caffeine, nicotine, tramad-ol, methadone and meconin in serum. The same substances were detected in the urine sample, along with COD, MOR, papaverine, hydrocotarnine and paracetamol.S3 PP 148316Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 315 - 316 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsDiscussionHER is quite unstable in aqueous medium and is rap-idly converted to 6-MAM due to spontaneous hydrolysis (Knight et al., 2014; Rook et al., 2006). This can be no-ticed in the results of the first case presented, where only 6-MAM was detected in the extracts from the syringe and the unknown powdered substance. The same hydrolysis occurs in the serum, resulting in the deacetylation of HER to 6-MAM, which is further metabolized to MOR (Rook et al., 2006). Different data on the half-lives of HER and 6-MAM have been reported in the literature. It is thought that HER can be detected in blood 10-40 min after intrave-nous administration, while 6-MAM 1-3 h, reaching max-imum plasma concentration immediately after injection (Rook et al., 2006). In our cases, larger number of opi-oid alkaloids and their metabolites were identified in urine rather than in blood. Several studies conducted using post-mortem biological samples suggest that the most suitable medium for detection of 6-MAM is the cerebrospinal flu-id (CSF), while others consider the vitreous humor to be the sample with the greatest number of positive findings on 6-MAM compared to other fluids and tissue samples from the same forensic cases, with CSF having the sec-ond greatest number of positive results (Goldberger et al., 1994;  Pragst et al., 1999; Wyman and Bultman, 2004). 6-MAM was not detected in any available biological sam-ple from the three forensic cases, thus further analysis is needed to determine the origin of the opiates. Even though MOR is an end product of HER metabolism, it can also be a metabolite of COD, which is an active substance in some formulations. Some studies have compared MOR/COD concentration ratio, suggesting that MOR/COD concentra-tion ratio >1 indicates HER use (Bogusz et al., 2001; Ceder and Jones, 2001; Konstantinova et al., 2012).  Other stud-ies suggest the use of acetylcodeine (AC), a by-product of HER synthesis, as a marker of illicit HER use. AC is con-sidered as the only definite marker of illicit HER use, along with 6-MAM, but its short half-life aggravates its useful-ness in forensic applications (Bogusz et al., 2001; Gold-berger et al., 1994; Musshoff et al., 2010). This is also con-firmed by the results of our study, where AC was not de-tected in any death case. Though some authors propose the presence of papaverine, especially its metabolites as a re-liable marker of HER use, several studies have shown that papaverine metabolites can be detected in urine after the consumption of poppy seeds (Musshoff et al., 2010; Pa-terson and Cordero, 2006). COD and noscapine (and its metabolites meconin and cotarnine) are also considered as markers of HER use (Bogusz et al., 2001; Paterson and Cordero, 2006). However, they can also be detected in bio-logical samples after food consumption as papaverine (Bo-gusz et al., 2001; Musshoff et al., 2010;  Paterson and Cor-dero, 2006). In our cases, almost all opium alkaloids were identified, but 6-MAM was not detected. Pharmaceutically prepared HER is not available as a treatment option in Re-public of Macedonia, therefore it can be concluded that the deceased had used illicit HER. ConclusionThe absence of 6-MAM in postmortem biological samples is not an indicator of HER non-use. When inter-preting the results for the opiate presence due to the use of HER or different opioids, the results of numerous research-es can be utilized, such as MOR/COD ratio as the most rel-evant marker or the presence of AC as a definite marker of HER use. The determination of other opioid alkaloids such as papaverine, noscapine and its metabolites, togeth-er with additional forensic evidences can be useful in au-topsy cases.ReferencesBogusz, M.J., Maier, R.D., Erkens, M., Kohls, U., 2001.

Macedonia* bujaroska_m@yahoo.comIntroductionOpioid dependence is a complex socio-medical state and a serious problem for the society, linked with a high morbidity and mortality rate (WHO, 2004). Even though several pharmacological agents are available, in the Re-public of Macedonia, the maintenance therapy includes methadone (METH) and buprenorphine, with METH be-ing the first agent used in the opioid substitution treatment (OST) and it still remains the main prescribed medication (EMCDDA, 2013). There are indications that alongside with the general decrease in drug seizures between 2009 and 2012 in Republic of Macedonia, there was some short-age in supply, encouraging users to replace heroin with other substances such as METH, benzodiazepines (BZDs) and tramadol (EMCDDA, 2013). Despite the prescription of BZDs for therapeutic purposes, the prevalence of their misuse among OST patients is reported to be high in oth-er countries and is related to severe consequences such as non-fatal and fatal overdoses (EMCDDA, 2015).The aim of this report is to assess the number and nature of drug-related deaths (DRDs) in the Republic of Macedo-nia over the period 2011-2015, with the emphasis on death cases involving positive findings for METH and BZDs.Materials and methodsAll toxicological analyses from autopsies performed at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Skopje during a 5-year-period were reviewed. Postmortem toxicological analysis of blood and urine samples was conducted using biochip array technology and fluorescence polarization im-munoassay, respectively. Whenever possible, the positive results from the screening were confirmed by gas chro-matography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), after previous sample preparation by ion-exchange solid-phase extrac-tion (SPE). Acid hydrolysis was performed prior to SPE for the urine samples showing positive results for BZDs tested with screening methods. The concentration of etha-nol in the samples was determined by headspace gas chro-matography-flame ionization detection.Results and discussionThe postmortem toxicological analyses were per-formed on a total of 1251 cases in the 5 year period be-ing reviewed. A total of 89 cases showed positive results for drugs of abuse, whereas combined use of psychoactive substances was noticed in 57 cases (64.05% of all DRDs). Concomitant use of METH and BZDs was implicated in 39 DRDs over the time period studied (43.82% of the to-tal DRDs), with the highest number of fatalities involving their combined use in 2013 (14 cases). The percentage of METH and BZDs DRDs gradually increases starting from 2011, with the highest peak seen in 2012 and 2013 (50% of all DRDs). After that, the percentage declines in 2014, reaching the same level as in 2011. A rise in the trend of DRDs is seen again in 2015. No information on the possi-ble involvement of deceased in OST was available. In all cases analyzed by GC-MS diazepam was the only BZD identified. The presence of ethanol was detected in only 9 cases of all studied DRDs.  Other substances (cannabi-S3 PP 149318Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 317 - 318 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsnoids, cocaine, tricyclic antidepressants and opiates) were detected in addition to the combination of METH and BZDs in 16 cases.The number of deaths in which METH is either the cause of death or a positive toxicological finding has sig-nificantly increased (Mijatovi\u0107 at al., 2014). In some stud-ies it has been reported that alcohol and BZDs are most commonly detected concomitants together with METH (Laberke and Bartsch, 2010; Mijatovi\u0107 at al., 2014). None-theless, regarding alcohol presence, this was not confirmed in this report where ethanol was detected in only 9 cases of all DRDs. Concomitant use of METH and BZDs was im-plicated in 43.82% of the total DRDs, with diazepam being the only BZD identified in all analyzed cases by GC-MS, similar to other studies (Iwersen-Bergmann at al., 2014; Mijatovi\u0107 at al. 2014).  Furthermore, this correlates with the data from EMCDDA stating that BZDs with a more rapid onset of action (diazepam, alprazolam) appear to be more frequently used by opioid users than those with a slower onset (EMCDDA, 2015). Much of the BZDs mis-use consists of self-medication for treatment of psychiat-ric and mood disorders, alleviation of withdrawal symp-toms and increase of the rewarding and reinforcing effects of the opioids (Eiroa-Orosa at al., 2010; EMCDDA, 2015).The potential for significant morbidity and mortality with METH, either alone or in combination with BZDs, is widely reported (Lee at al., 2014). METH\u2019s inhibitory ef-fect on the brain\u2019s respiratory center can lead to respirato-ry depression, hypoventilation and pulmonary edema (Ber-nard, 2013). It is suggested that \u00b5-opioid agonists suppress respiration by acting on the respiratory centers in the brain-stem, decreasing the ventilatory response to CO2 (Pattin-son, 2008). In this way, the inspiration is prolonged, while changes in tidal volume can be observed at higher opioid doses (Lalley, 2003) The concurrent use of opioids with BZDs and other central nervous system depressants is con-sidered to be an important element in the mechanism of death (Bernard, 2013). Some authors suggest that BZDs compete with METH for \u00b5-opioid receptors, resulting in higher concentrations of METH in acute intoxications with METH and BZDs, while in chronic abuse situations, BZDs inhibit hepatic enzymes that metabolize METH, also lead-ing to increased METH concentrations (Mikolaenko at al., 2002). Moreover, it had been postulated that BZDs may also have effects on signal transduction and second mes-senger systems involved with \u00b5-opioid receptor regulation (Poisnel at al., 2009). Other possibly fatal METH-relat-ed effects in the body, such as pulmonary oedema and ar-rhythmias secondary to QT-interval prolongation must be also borne in mind (Bernard, 2013). The high frequency of positive findings on METH and BZDs in postmortem analysis of DRDs implies possi-ble METH diversion and widespread availability of BZDs among METH users. ConclusionIt is complicated to establish the role of BZDs in DRDs and their misuse has been shown to contribute to morbidi-ty and mortality rate among METH users. Much still needs to be done regarding the monitoring of METH and educat-ing the patients involved in OST about the risks associated with multiple drug use.ReferencesBernard, J.P., Havnes, I., Sl\u00f8rdal, L., Waal, H., M\u00f8rland, J., Khiabani, H.Z., 2013.

(Proleterska), 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* nbitoljanu@gmail.comIntroductionAccording to World Health Organization, the suicide death rate per population of 100000 in the Republic of Macedonia is 5.42 suicides (WHO, 2014). The most com-mon suicide methods in our country are hanging, intoxica-tion with corrosive substances and gunshot wounds. Rarest way of suicide is intoxication with drugs especially with barbiturates. We have only two cases of intoxication with barbiturates in the last five years. Materials and methodsCase hystory: Female, twenty-five years was found dead lying on the bed in a hotel room, where she stayed. During the external examination of the body on the crime scene we found complete development of rigor mortis. On the bedside table, were found a box of Diazepam, gel tube of Lidocaine, a plastic bag with white powder contents and two suicide letters (one designated for the mother, and one for the police). The suicide letters for the police contained the whole process of the suicide, with mentioning of the drug types used. In the letter was described Pentobarbital used because causes coma and respiratory depression, Li-docaine used for decrease the unpleasant bitter taste and Metoclopramide used to prevent vomiting. Postmortem blood and urine samples were collected for toxicological investigation. Toxicological qualitative analysis of blood using gas chromatography mass spec-trometry (GC-MS) was performed. Determination of eth-anol was performed using headspace gas chromatography. Quantification of urine samples was performed with fluo-rescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA, AxSym system analyser\u2013 Abbott, USA). ResultsAutopsy findingsPostmortem lividity was developed, distributed on the dorsal portion of the body and disappeared on blunt pres-sure. Medico-legal autopsy revealed no external changes. No findings of natural disease were observed. During the internal examination, we observed non-specific signs of asphyxia. The brain was slightly oedematous. The lungs were congested and oedematous, with subserous petechi-al hemorrhages.Toxicology findings GC-MS toxicological analysis confirmed the presence of Pentobarbital, Diazepam, Lidocain-M-(desethyl) and Metoclopramide. No ethanol was detected in the samples. FPIA results from the urine samples indicated a level of pen-tobarbital (more than 2000 ng/ml) and 498 ng/ml of diaze-pam. According to urine cut\u2013off levels for reporting posi-tive blood level or limit of quantitation (CLR,2016), both urine pentobarbital and diazepam are over the cut off. No other drugs were found in the blood and urine of the victim.PsychoautopsyThe suicide letter to her mother contained the reason of the suicide explaining the lack of reason and motivation for life and fatigue, mentioning unsuccessful treatment at S3 PP 150320Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 319 - 320 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsphysiatrist. In the letter to her mother she stated that she was tired from being depressed all the time and that she had had nothing to live for, because she had no intention to work, get married or have a child. She had one previ-ous suicide attempt with barbiturates and benzodiazepines. Discussion Suicide is an act or an instance of taking one\u2019s own life voluntarily and intentionally. Suicide is a behavior that dif-fers from one person to another and from one time to an-other and has different motivations and anticipated gains. There are differences in the suicide method used in dif-ferent countries. Three methods \u2013 hanging, pesticide poi-soning and firearm are dominated. Jumping from a height and other methods of poisoning (i.e. mainly poisoning by drugs) occasionally appears as important alternative meth-ods. The suicide method with poisoning is more popular in women than in men. In general, underlying suicide pat-terns tell us more about the availability and acceptability of suicide methods than about other disparities (Ajdacic-Gross et al., 2008). Factors that affect the risk of suicide include genetic vulnerability and psychiatric, psychologi-cal, familial, social, and cultural factors. The effects of me-dia are also important; the spread of information about sui-cide methods affects the choices that people make when at-tempting to kill themselves. In this case during forensics analyses and psychoautopsy of the suicide letters we con-cluded depressed mood, lack of interest in pleasure, fillings of worthlessness, guilt, suicide statements and attempts all point out to major depressive disorder. Detailed description of suicide, the information of drug effects used direct on preparation process and internet investigation, which sug-gest awareness of the consequences.The suicide letter mentioned alleged ingestion of Pen-tobarbital, Diazepam, Lidocaine and Reglan. The toxicol-ogy department of our institute confirmed the presence of these compounds in the blood and urine of the victim. Pen-tobarbital is a short-acting barbiturate that acts like a non-selective central nervous system depressant, and is primar-ily used as sedative hypnotic, as an anticonvulsant in sub hypnotic doses, medically induced coma and euthanasia in veterinary medicine (Charney et al., 2006; Greenblatt et al., 1979). In cases of intoxications, suppression of the cen-tral nervous system, hypotension, hypothermia, coordina-tion disorders, respiratory failure and coma are the major clinical symptoms (Fell et al., 1968). Diazepam is a de-rivative of benzodiazepine that is widely prescribed as an antianxiety agent. Diazepam is sometimes used with other medications to treat seizures. When barbiturates are com-bined with other central nervous system (CNS) depres-sants, such as alcohol, opiates, or benzodiazepines, over-dose is even more dangerous due to additive depressant effects on the CNS and respiratory system (Mactier et al., 2014). The clinical effects of barbiturates and benzo-diazepines are similar and result as sequelae to hyperpo-larizing the neuron, there are subtle differences in terms of receptor binding. Barbiturates increase the duration of Cl ion channel opening at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, which, in turn, increases the efficacy of GABA. Benzodiazepines, on the other hand, increase the frequency of Cl ion channel openings at the GABA recep-tor, which, in turn, increases the potency of GABA (Shar-ma and Hoffman, 2011). ConclusionSuicides with intoxication with these types of drugs are rare because of the unavailability of drugs, because they are prescription drugs, or are intended for clinical practice only. This case, suggest on detailed planned and determination to end her life. The combination of Pentobarbital, Diazepam, antiemetic drugs and the content of the suicide letter stat-ing when, and how she will die, suggest that the victim was familiar with drug effects and knew where to get them. We should point that among all classical forensic methods, we include psychoautopsy as a good method which helps us to finalize all investigation and make scientific based conclu-sions for motivation and way of taking her own life.

Cyril and Methodius University,Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* leonardkurti@hotmail.comIntroductionFor centuries, juniper berries and leaves extracts and their essential oils have been used in the folk medicine due to their therapeutic properties, such as antimicrobial, an-ti-inflammatory, diuretic, hypoglycemic, hypotensive and analgesic effect. Due to the exclusive aroma, juniper cones are utilized in the food industry as a spice and in the pro-duction of alcoholic beverages as flavor. Today, there is an increased interest in the identification of natural and safe sources of antioxidants, in order to replace synthetic anti-oxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylat-ed hydroxytoluene (BHT) and tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) which have a limited use due to their toxicity and carcinogenicity.The purpose of this study is to determine total phenols, total flavonoids and the antioxidant activity of ethanol ex-tracts from berries of Juniperus excelsa, Juniperus commu-nis and Juniperus foetidissima from different localities of the R. of Macedonia.Materials and methodsThe plant samples were collected in late autumn in 2011 and 2012. The berries (4 samples) of J. communis (JC) were collected from Skopje (sk), Velestovo (ve), Kice-vo (ki), and Resen (re), the berries (2 samples) of J. excel-sa (JE) from Dojran (do) and Velestovo (ve) and the berries (2 samples) of J. foetidissima from Valandovo (va) and Ve-lestovo (ve). Botanical identification was made at the Insti-tute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy - Skopje. The plant material was properly dried, stored in paper bags and kept in dark and cool place until testing.The plant material (0.5 g) was milled to a fine powder and extracted with 70% ethanol. The extraction procedure for sample preparation was performed with 10 mL of 70% ethanol for 30 min in the ultrasonic bath. After filtration of the extracts, the volume was adjusted to 10 mL. Estimation of the total phenolic content (TPC) was done using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent according to the Sin-gleton\u2019s method with minor modifications.The total flavonoid content (TFC) was estimated using the aluminium chloride colorimetric method described by Talari (Talari, 2012).The antioxidant activity was determined using three methods: DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) method, FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) method and H2O2 (Hydrogen peroxide) method.The ability of the tested extracts to reduce the DPPH radical was determined from the color bleaching of the purple ethanol solution of DPPH. The antioxidant activi-ty of the extracts is expressed as IC50 (mg/mL), indicating the concentration that is required to cause 50% reduction of the DPPH radical. The FRAP activity of the extracts was determined according to the procedure described by Oyai-zu. The scavenging capacity of the extracts for hydrogen peroxide was determined according to the method of Ruch with minor modifications. S3 PP 151322Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 321 - 322 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe content of total phenolic compounds in all in-vestigated samples vary from 41.32\u00b10.20 mg GAE/g dw to 96.83\u00b10.41mg GAE/g dw in the samples JF(va) and JE(ve), respectively. The total flavonoid content in the plant samples was in the range from 14.03\u00b11.20 mg QE/g dw to 34.01\u00b13.87 mg QE/g dw in the samples of JF(va) and JC(ki), respectively.All the extracts showed antioxidant activity using the DPPH method. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the samples increased with an increase in extract concen-tration. The ability of the corresponding extract for reduc-tion of DPPH free radicals expressed as IC50 values was obtained in the range from 0.006 mg/mL for the sample JF(ve) to 0.713 mg/mL for the sample JC(ki). The obtained reducing ability against DPPH radical was compared to the IC50 values for Quercetin and BHA (1.0 \u00b5g/mL and 6.0 \u00b5g/mL, respectively). All tested samples manifested good scavenging potential for H2O2. The lowest inhibitory activ-ity against H2O2 was found in JE(do):17.68%, 16.29% and 15.24% for the extract concentrations 25, 10, and 5 mg/mL, respectively, while the highest inhibitory activity was found in JF(va): 52.73%; 49.47% and 44.2%, for the corre-sponding extract concentrations.The ferric reducing antioxidant potential was deter-mined by evaluating the capacity of the extract to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Very similar to the DPPH test, the reducing antioxidant potential of every extract showed a positive correlation with their concentrations. The JF(ve) sample showed the strongest reduction of iron 51.08%, 25.19%, and 16.33% for the corresponding concentrations of the extract (0.71; 0.28 and 0.14 mg/mL), while the weak-est activity is detected in the JC(re) sample with 18.85%, 11.13% and 6.88% for the corresponding extract concen-trations. The activity of extract was compared to the reduc-ing capacity of two standard substances - ascorbic acid and quercetin in concentrations of 0.007 mg/mL, with 27.71% and 21.37% FRAP capacity, respectively.The berries of the Macedonian wild grown J. commu-nis, J. excelsa and J. foetidissima are a rich source of poly-phenolic compounds. These results are corresponding to those obtained by other authors (Miceli et al., 2009, Elmas-tas M., 2006). Additionally, the obtained values for the an-tioxidant potential of the tested samples are also in accor-dance with the results found in numerous research papers in the field of interest, suggesting that the selected plant samples are a rich source of phenolic and flavonoid com-ponents, and a potential source of antioxidant compounds (Stassi et al., 1998).ConclusionAccording to the obtained results for total phenols, fla-vonoids and the antioxidant potential of the selected plant samples, it may be concluded that the ethanol extracts of berries of J. communis, J. excelsa and J. foetidissima rep-resent potential sources of natural antioxidants. Although a positive correlation was obtained between the total phenol content and the antioxidant activity, further studies are re-quired to clarify which of the components are responsible for the antioxidant properties. In addition, screening with in vitro assays has little meaning if there is no clear evi-dence of the effectiveness of the extracts in vivo. There-fore, it is suggested that further studies are to be performed in order to evaluate the in vivo effects of these extracts.ReferencesElmastas, M., G.

Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* bsimonovska@gmail.comIntroductionMany analytes of interest in the clinical laboratory can vary over an individual\u2019s lifetime, simply because of natural biological factors involved in the aging process. These variations may occur rapidly at critical points in the life cycle, such as during the neonatal period, childhood, puberty, menopause, or old age. Biological variation has an important effect on the interpretation of all laboratory investigations, including triglycerides and cholesterol (Fraser, 2001).Biological variation, i.e., the normal day-to-day variation of cholesterol is within the range of 3-5%. Many studies have also documented a seasonal variation. Although there is a discordance between the studies, cholesterol levels tend to be higher in winter and lower during the summer months independent of the country of origin, ethnicity, age, sex, and baseline lipids. The seasonal variation has been reported to be as high as 12% (Deeg, 2006).   Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in humans and animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transfer of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils.Cholesterol is a sterol (or modified steroid), a lipid molecule that is biosynthesized by all animal cells because it is an essential structural component of all cell membranes required to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. It enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall to protect membrane integrity and cell viability.Cholesterol and triglycerides, like many other essential components of the body, attract clinical attention when present in abnormal concentrations. For the diagnosis of different lipoprotein disorders, one can usually rely on simple plasma values of total cholesterol and triglycerides. Obtained lipid values will be interpreted in relation to age and gender according to reference values (Mula-Abed et al, 2008). MethodsAnalysis of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides is usually performed on blood specimens collected by the standard procedure. Fasting venous blood was collected at 8-10 am following an overnight fast, from apparently healthy participants (men and women, aged 15-67 years). The specimens were collected in 1-year period. Serum TG and total cholesterol were measured by enzymatic methods using kits from Biosystems (Spain) and biochemistry analyzer Mindray BS-200. Cholesterol was assayed by the cholesterol esterase/cholesterol oxidase/4-aminophenazone/phenol method and the triglycerides by glycerol phosphate oxidase/peroxidase method (Biosystems, 2012)Standard statistical methods were used or the analysis of data. The mean and SD were calculated for each parameter of serum triglycerides and cholesterol from each participant. The data was inspected for any outlier (defined as values outside \u00b1 3 SD from the mean). There was no outlier and all results were within the mean value \u00b1 2 SD. ResultsThe study was conducted with cholesterol samples from 210 apparently healthy participants with mean of 5.22\u00b11.85 (Coefficient of variation (CV) 17.73%) and triglycerides samples from 204 participants with mean of 1.56\u00b11.54 (CV 49.46%). These results were divided for observation in groups by age and gender. S3 PP 152324Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 323 - 324 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsThere are 10 groups with number of participants: Group 1: 15-29 years male, Group 2: 15-29 years female, Group 3: 30-39 years male, Group 4: 30-39 years female, Group 5: 40-49 years male, Group 6: 40-49 years female, Group 7: 50-59 years male, Group 8: 50-59 years female, Group 9: 60+ years male and Group 10: 60+ years female. From these groups 5 groups were made for observation by gender. The obtained results from the participants were compared with the reference values provided by the used kits manufacturer (Biosystems, 2012).The results from cholesterol measurements follows:Group 1, N=26, x=5.11\u00b11.76 (CV 17.19%); Group 2, N=21, x=4.87\u00b11.6 (CV 16.46%); Group 3, N=23, x=5.37\u00b11.84 (CV 17.2%); Group 4, N=21, x=5.00\u00b11.76 (CV 17.67%); Group 5, N=20, x=5.58\u00b11.92 (CV 17.24%); Group 6, N=20, x=5.25\u00b11.06 (CV 20.19%); Group 7, N=21, x=5.27\u00b12.16 (CV 20.5%); Group 8, N=20, x=5.57\u00b11.12 (CV 10.1%); Group 9, N=21, x=5.15\u00b12.22 (CV 21.53%); Group 10, N=17, x=4.99\u00b11.5 (CV 14.97%).The results from triglycerides measurements follows:Group 1, N=24, x=1.57\u00b11,7 (CV 54.12%); Group 2, N=22, x=1.16\u00b11.0 (CV 43.37%); Group 3, N=22, x=1.94\u00b11.06 (CV 27.53%); Group 4, N=21, x=1.20\u00b11.7 (CV 70.71%); Group 5, N=17, x=1.96\u00b11.58 (CV 40.64%); Group 6, N=18, x=1.40\u00b11.8 (CV 64.65%); Group 7, N=20, x=1.72\u00b11.86 (CV 54.13%); Group 8, N=21, x=1.73\u00b11.26 (CV 36.36%); Group 9, N=20, x=1.33\u00b11.08 (CV 40.38%); Group 10, N=19, x=1.66\u00b11.48 (CV 44.39%).DiscussionBiological variation has an important effect on the in-terpretation of different laboratory investigations, includ-ing triglycerides and cholesterol. There is also a growing interest in evaluating the cut-off limits for the desirable thresholds of serum cholesterol and triglycerides accord-ing to different recommendations and clinical trials, with a trend is towards lowering these limits.The inter-individual variations for cholesterol are 17.73% and for triglycerides are 49.46%. The study by Ford (1989) had reported an inter-individual variation 17.3% for cholesterol, which is in agreement with the val-ues observed in our study. The range of variability in serum lipid profile between individuals in this study for cholester-ol is 4.3-6.14 mmol/L, but according to the kit documenta-tion cholesterol level should be lower than 5.2 mmol/L and for triglycerides this range is between 0.79-2.33 mmol/L (lower than 1.7 mmol/L declared in the kit documentation).ConclusionFrom the data for cholesterol, with the usage of t-test, we can conclude that there are no significant differences in the results between different age groups and gender, but there is a significance in results for triglycerides (p<0,05) between participants with age of 15-49 in both male and female groups. The study should be widened with imple-menting analytical variation and intra-individual data.Extensive medical research has identified hyperlipid-emia as a major risk factor for heart disease with an estab-lished clinical correlation between hyperlipidemia and the incidence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). The impor-tance of this study is detection of sudden changes in lipid values that may indicate a change in diet, medications, or onset of a new disease state.ReferencesBiosystems, S.A., 2012.

Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* bsimonovska@gmail.comIntroductionMany analytes in biochemistry laboratories may vary during the life of an individual, simply because there is a factor involved in its aging process. Also gender in various analytes can play an important role. In our study we made a comparison between different age groups, gender and reference range for creatinine and urea in serum (Cvitkovic and Mesic,1999).Creatinine is a chemical waste molecule that is produced when muscles use creatine, another naturally occurring product in the body, to create energy. About 2% of creatine is converted to creatinine each day. Most of the waste creatinine is expelled from the body in the urine (Hosten, 1990). The creatinine level measured for an individual should be relatively constant over time and should be within a \u201cnormal\u201d range. The creatinine level is one of the main indicators of kidney function. If the creatinine level is elevated, the patient should be further evaluated for other signs of kidney disease and renal problems. Normal creatinine level ranges will depend on age, gender and other health factors (Taylor, 1989).Blood urea nitrogen, known by the simple initials BUN is the measurement of urea nitrogen levels in the blood. Urea nitrogen is naturally produced by the liver as a waste product of digested protein. After production, urea is transported to the kidneys where it is excreted from the blood stream. The BUN test is therefore conducted to determine how much urea nitrogen is still present in the blood, and this test mainly determines if the kidneys renal functions are working as they should. There are many factors that could bring about high or low levels of BUN.BUN and creatinine tests are often used together to determine the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine. The BUN to creatinine ratio ultimately helps the physician to find the cause of the poor kidney function and the causes may vary from dehydration to malnutrition or kidney failure.MethodsAnalysis of serum creatinine and urea was performed on blood specimens collected by the standard procedure. Fasting venous blood was collected at 8-10 am following an overnight fast, from apparently healthy participants (men and women, aged 15-65 years). The specimens were collected in a period of one year. Serum creatinine and urea were measured by enzymatic methods using kits and from Biosystems (Spain) and the biochemistry analyzer Mindray BS-200. Creatinine was assayed by picrate in alkaline medium forming colored complex, Jaff\u00e9 method (Fabiny and Ertingshausen, 1971) and urea by urease/glutamate dehydrogenase method (Gutmann  and Bergmeyer, 1974).Standard statistical methods were used or the analysis of data. The mean and SD were calculated for each parameter of serum creatinine and urea from each participant. The data were inspected for any outlier (defined as values outside \u00b1 3 SD from the mean). There was no outlier and all results were within the mean \u00b1 2 SD.ResultsThe study was conducted with creatinine samples from 220 apparently healthy participants with mean value of 74.19\u00b123.22 (coefficient of variation (CV) 15.64%) and urea samples from 217 participants with mean of 4,88\u00b11,31 (CV 26,94%). These samples results were divided for observation in groups by age and gender. There are 10 groups with number of participants: Group 1 \u2013 15-29 years male, Group 2 \u2013 15-29 years female, Group S3 PP 153326Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 325 - 326 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentations3 \u2013 30-39 years male, Group 4 \u2013 30-39 years female, Group 5 \u2013 40-49 years male, Group 6 \u2013 40-49 years female, Group 7 \u2013 50-59 years male, Group 8 \u2013 50-59 years female, Group 9 \u2013 60-65 years male and Group 10 \u2013 60-65 years female. From these groups 5 groups were made for observation by gender. The obtained results from the participants were compared with the reference values provided by the used kits manufacturer (Biosystems, 2014).The results from creatinine measurements were as follows:Group 1, N=24, x=79.63\u00b19.67 (CV 12.14%); Group 2, N=22, x=64.457\u00b19.85 (CV 15.28%); Group 3, N=24 x=80.42\u00b18.3 (CV 10.32%); Group 4, N=23, x=65.10\u00b17.26 (CV 11.15%); Group 5, N=22, x=80.23\u00b19.09 (CV 11.33%); Group 6, N=21, x=63.28\u00b16.75 (CV 10.67%); Group 7, N=24, x=81.37\u00b110.68 (CV 13.12%); Group 8, N=21, x=68.28\u00b16.02 (CV 8.81%); Group 9, N=21, x=83.28\u00b110.832 (CV 13.0%); Group 10, N=18, x=72.78\u00b19.81 (CV 13.48%).The results from urea measurements were as follows:Group 1, N=24, x=4.56\u00b10.88 (CV 19.3%); Group 2, N=22, x=3.8\u00b11.16 (CV 30.53%); Group 3, N=24, x=5.364\u00b11.21 (CV 22.57%); Group 4, N=21, x=3.91\u00b11.33 (CV 34.01%); Group 5, N=22, x=5.3\u00b11.16 (CV 21.89%); Group 6, N=20, x=3.97\u00b10.74 (CV 18.64%); Group 7, N=23, x=5.35\u00b11.39 (CV 25.98%); Group 8, N=23, x=5.19\u00b11.49 (CV 28.71%); Group 9, N=20, x=5.59\u00b11.58 (CV 28.26%); Group 10, N=18, x=5.56\u00b11.29(CV 23.20%).DiscussionBlood and urine analytes concentrations vary due to age factors from infancy to old age. From infancy to puberty, serum creatinine concentration uniformly increases, depending on the skeletal muscle development.In the elderly, the kidney concentrating ability is decreased, which results in reduced creatinine clearance. This is due to a decreased urinary creatinine excretion as a result of reduced lean body mass rather than to renal dysfunction. Plasma urea concentration and urinary protein excretion increase with age. In addition to differences in gender specific hormones, differences also exist in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters. Plasma concentrations of amino acids, urea, uric acid and creatinine are higher in males than in females. Clinical chemistry analytes are greatly influenced by diet and drinking. A high-protein diet increases plasma urea, serum cholesterol, and phosphate concentrations. In contrast, starvation, fasting and malnutrition also induce clinically significant changes in analytes concentrations. Long-term starvation entails decreased concentrations of blood protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins, and urea. On the other hand, the concentrations of creatinine and uric acid increase. Urinary excretion of ammonia and creatinine is increased, whereas the excretion of urea, calcium and phosphate is reduced. Due to the decreased skeletal mass, serum concentrations of urea and creatinine as well as creatinine clearance are reduced. Hemolysis can cause an interference factor for the analysis of creatinine. Also, bilirubin can cause false positive results in creatinine determination.ConclusionFrom this data for creatinine, with the usage of the t-test, we can conclude that there are significant differences in results between different age groups and gender, but there is no significance in results for urea for participants with age of 50-65 in both male and female groups.The inter-individual variations for creatinine are 15,64% and for urea are 26,94%. The range of variability in serum creatinine between individuals in this study is between 61,57-100,4 \u00b5mol/L for male participants and 50,9-82,66 \u00b5mol/L for female, but according to the kit documentation creatinine levels should be 62-106 \u00b5mol/L for male and 44-80 \u00b5mol/L for female. For urea this range is between 2,08-7,64 mmol/L (2,6-6,5 mmol/L by the kit documentation).It is of great importance that physicians be aware of these factors, because the final interpretation of the analyses and decisions on therapeutic procedures based on this interpretation actually lead to the physician\u2019s final judgment. In this process, the laboratory should act as a reliable and consistent collaborator.ReferencesHosten, O.A., 1990.

Worldwide urine screening tests use for preliminary re-sults of opiate abuse for employees in the workplace, ath-letes in doping control and etc. (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Lum and Mushlin, 2004). However, existing problem in interpreting the results of opiate urine analysis arises be-cause immunoassays screening tests have high sensitivity but lower specificity because of cross-reactivity with sub-stances other than the drugs in question (Lum and Mush-lin, 2004). Therefore, it is well known that positive opi-ate results may be obtained during drugs of abuse screen-ing related to certain drugs and food intake (EFSA, 2011; Jankovi\u010dov\u00e1 et al., 2009; Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Lum and Mushlin, 2004). Seeds of the opium poppy plant are legally sold and widely consumed as food. Morphine and codeine are nat-urally occurring substituent of the poppy plant, Papa-ver somniferum. The opiate content of poppy seeds var-ies greatly and is dependent on the seed origin and meth-od processing (EFSA, 2011; Samano et al., 2015). Due to contamination during harvesting, the seeds can contain morphine and other opiate alkaloids (Lachenmeier et al., 2010). Literature data and our previous case study indi-cate that consummation of both, raw poppy seeds and bak-ing mixtures, induce positive immunoassay test for opiates (\u0110uki\u0107-\u0106osi\u0107 et al. 2014; Jankovi\u010dov\u00e1 et al., 2009; Sama-no et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2014). However, the time pe-riod during which it is possible to obtain false positive opi-ates results is not yet sufficiently understood.The purpose of this case study was to determine time period of presence of opiates in urine after the consump-tion of product which contain poppy seed using immuno-assay test and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) technique. Materials and methodsFemale participant age between 20 and 25 years with-out previous known history of substance abuse provided written informed consent to participate in this case study. Participant consumed a piece of strudel with poppy seeds from a local bakery in the morning on the first day and collected ad libitum each urine sample during next three days. Urine samples (n=8) were collected 5, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours after strudel ingestion. Specimens were analyzed with the Opiates Test Card (MP Biomed-icals, LLC, California) immunoassay at 300 ng/mL cut-offs, and all positive samples were quantified for morphine and codeine by LC/MS. Urine specimen was prepared us-ing liquid/liquid extraction of opiate by mixture of chloro-form and isopropanol (9 : 1; v/v). Extracts were analyzed by LC/MS technique: separation column Waters Spheri-sorb 5 \u03bcm, ODS2, 4.6 x 100 mm; mobile phase: ammo-nium acetate:acetonitrile (80 : 20; v/v), mobile phase flow rate 0.3 mL/min; mass detection range: 100-400 m/z.S3 PP 154328Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 327 - 328 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe screening immunoassay test for opiates (cutoff 300 ng/mL) was positive for all investigated urine samples. These results in accordance with previous studies that pop-py-seed food products, such as poppy-seed strudels, may cause a true-positive immunoassay screening test for opi-ates due to the presence of low, but still detectible, levels of opium alkaloids (Lum and Mushlin, 2004). The morphine content in poppy seeds from around the world is variable (0.1-294 mg/g), and exposure concentrations depend on poppy seed origin, harvesting procedure and the method of poppy seed foodstuffs preparation (Samano et al., 2015; Thevis et al., 2003). Significant reductions in opiate con-tent have been documented after food preparative process-es, with decreased drug concentration shown after wash-ing, soaking, grinding and baking (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Samano et al., 2015). To minimize the number of positive opiate tests resulting from poppy seed consump-tion, cutoff concentration for morphine and codeine raised from 300 to 2,000 ng/mL (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Sa-mano et al., 2015). However, only screening immunoassay test for opiates with lower cutoff  (300 ng/mL) are avail-able in our country. In all investigated urine samples, morphine and co-deine concentrations were determined by LC/MS. The following values were obtained for morphine: 0.25, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02, 0.01 and 0.01 mg/L, and codeine 0.07, 0.09, 0.06, 0.02, 0.009, 0.008, 0.001, 0.001 mg/L, re-spectively. The highest measured concentration of mor-phine and codeine was obtained at 5 and 12 hours, respec-tively. This is in agreement with literature data that peak concentrations of morphine and codeine appeared 4-12 hours after consumption of poppy seed (Lachenmeier et al., 2010). However, for interpreting urine opiate results need to know that measured concentrations of morphine and codeine after the consumption of products which con-tain poppy seed are noticeably lower then concentrations of opiates which can be measured in urine of opiate abus-ers. Furthermore, presence of heroin metabolite 6-mono-acetylmorphine can be detected in urine of opiate abusers using LC/MS or GC/MS techniques (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Samano et al., 2015). In contrast to results of this case, the most studies with intake of poppy seeds, raw and cakes, shows that urine samples were negative by 20 hours after consumption (Jankovi\u010dov\u00e1 et al., 2009; Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014). Present data show that, even 72 hours after the oral intake of strudel containing poppy seeds, the urinary level of opiate alkaloids can be detectible. Namely, approx-imate detection time of opiates of abuse in urine is up to three days and these data demonstrated that opiates can be detected in urine after consumption poppy seed stru-del during the same time period as in users of psychoactive substances. Thevis et al. (2003) also demonstrated positive opiate urine at 48 h after consumption a typical poppy seed cake with high morphine content (151.6 mg/kg). The con-sumption of poppy seed products in those out-of-competi-tion time spaces might be considered as non problematic, but the long length of stay of opiates in urine samples can lead to positive doping results in competition tests up to three days after oral intake of cakes with poppy seeds (The-vis et al., 2003; Lachenmeier et al., 2010). ConclusionThe results of the present case study support previous findings and confirm that opiates can be detected in urine after consumption popular poppy seed strudel. However, these data indicates that time period of presence of opiates in urine can be prolonged after consumption of this prod-uct. This finding should be taken into account in routine testing of employees in the workplace, members of the mil-itary, students in schools, as well as athletes.

Capitata) is a vegeta-ble crop, economically important in Republic of Macedo-nia. In nutrition, it is used in fresh or processed state.Dobri\u0107evi\u0107 et al. (2006), have determined the chem-ical composition of 100 g of cabbage, where the amount of vitamin C ranges from 20 to 100 mg/100 g, dry mat-ter content from 5% to 9%, fiber 1.0% to 1.7%. Accord-ing to Rumeza et al. (2006), the water content in cabbage was 92%, protein 1.6%, fat 0.2%, carbohydrates 4.8%, ash 0.6%, Ca 52 mg/100g and P 44 mg/100g. The energy val-ue is 24 kcal/100 g. Vitamin C which is contained in the cabbage has antioxidant effect, it protects the human body from stress, and it is a cofactor in several vital enzymat-ic reactions (Cauniietal, 2010). According to Gjorgjev et al. (2008), the content of Ca and P in cabbage is in pro-portion that contributes to a better use of these micronu-trients for growth and development of the organism. There are also the following elements: K, Na and Cl, and the trace elements: Cu, Zn, Co and Mn (Lamba\u0161a, 2006). Cab-bage contains a significant amount of aromatic substanc-es and organic acids, which give the typical taste and smell (Gjorgjev et al., 2008). Fresh cabbage has healing proper-ties when treating stomach ulcer, protects mucous mem-branes, strengthens the immune system against many dis-eases, increases hemoglobin in the blood and cures anemia, affect the normalization of blood pressure, cures rheuma-tism, reduces the risk of colon hose etc (Vlahovi\u0107, 1999).During the drying process on appropriate temperature, free water evaporates which preserves the stability of the product from microbiological and chemical aspect. The content of water in the dried vegetables ranges from 8 to 12%. At the same time, it the concentration of sugars and other ingredients is increased (Katalini\u0107, 2006). During the drying process it is important to apply appropriate temper-ature, otherwise it will adversely affect the texture and the color (Karakashova, 2003).Hussein (2012), determined the chemical composition of the dry cabbage: water content 7.25%, proteins 14.34%, fat 0.97%, fiber 21.64%, ash 5.82%, carbohydrates 71.62% and phenolic components 81.58 mg/100 g.Materials and methodsThe research in both hybrid cabbage, transam (white cabbage) and maestro (red cabbage), in fresh and dried samples showed: total dry matter content, soluble dry mat-ter, total acids, reducing sugars, ash, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin C, chlorophyll and anthocyanins.In the analysis were used the following methods: total dry matter with drying chamber at T 105 \u00b0C to a constant mass; soluble dry matter by refractometer at 20 \u00b0C; vitamin C by Tillmans method with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; total organic acid with 0.1 M solution of NaOH; reduc-ing sugars by Luff-Schoorl method; total mineral matter (ash) in Muffle furnaces on 550 \u00baC; calcium and phospho-rus were studied by the ICC ENISO14082:2003 method. Quantification of chlorophyll and anthocyanins was per-formed by using a spectrophotometer, for chlorophyll at a wavelength 662 and 644 nm, and for anthocyanins at a wavelength of 700 and 420 nm.The obtained results were statistically processed, using a special computer program (SPSS for Windows, Sum of squares procedure, Model III). S3 PP 155330Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 329 - 330 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe tested hybrids transam and maestro have Dutch origin, they have high dry matter content and are suitable raw material for the manufacturing industry.Determination of total dry matter content is an impor-tant parameter according to which are determined the qual-ity features of tested hybrids in fresh state, as well as in dried products. It was determined that the average content of the total dry matter content of the hybrid maestro was 7.50% in fresh and 86.85% in the dried samples, while hy-brid transam had a value of 8.45% in fresh and 88.4% in the dried samples. The average content of reducing sug-ars in hybrid transam was 4.40% in fresh and 39.75% in the dried samples and in the fresh head of cabbage of hy-brid maestro is3.6%, while in the dried samples is 33.95%.The total acids in fresh head of cabbage of the hybrid transam are 0.19% and for hybrid maestro are 0.21%, while for the dried samples they are 1.63% for hybrid maestro, to 1.76% for the hybrid transam. The tests for vitamin C in hybrid maestro in fresh head of cabbage determined aver-age content of 80.95 mg/100 g and 31.69 mg/100 g in the dried samples, the hybrid transam in fresh head of cabbage is 19.50 mg/100 g and 17.7 mg/100 g in the dried samples.The average ash content in both fresh tested hybrids was 0.53% for the maestro and 0.63% for transam, while for the dried samples were determined values of 5.70% for the mae-stro and for the hybrid transam the value of ash was 6.20%. By analyzing the average calcium Ca content in tested fresh hybrids determined were the following values: 80.95 mg/100 g in hybrid maestro and 45.15 mg/100 g in hybrid transam. Unlike in the fresh, in the dried samples the Ca is more com-mon in the hybrid transam 41.11mg/100 g than in the hybrid maestro 36.26 mg/100 g. The average content of P for both tested hybrids in fresh head of cabbage was 0.53 mg/100 g for maestro and 0.63 mg/100 g for transam. In the dried sam-ples were determined values of P 23.6 mg/100 g in hybrid transam and 21.2 mg/100 g in hybrid maestro.By analysis of variance and LSD test at the level of 0.05 and 0.01, it has been determined a statistically signif-icant difference in values for all tested parameters between both hybrids for both the fresh and the dried samples.In the hybrid transam in fresh state it has not been quantified the presence of chlorophyll. In the dried samples of the hybrid transam was found a greater concentration of chlorophyll b (0.24 mg/cm3) compared to chlorophyll a (0.20 mg/cm3). The presence of anthocyanins is found only in hybrid maestro. In the fresh head of cabbage was found more anthocyanins content, 7.14% and 1.5% polymeric dyes, compared to the dried cabbage, where the content of anthocyanins was 26.04% and 1.0% polymeric dyes. Their representation in dried cabbage compared with fresh cab-bage, point to possible degradation changes of the antho-cyanins colored matters which occur in the drying process of red cabbage.ConclusionBased on the analysis it can be concluded that the test-ed hybrids are characterized by good technological and nutritional properties. Better nutrition values are featured in dried samples of the hybrid transam than of the hybrid maestro. In the hybrid maestro, the value of vitamin C is statistically significantly higher than the hybrid transam. Dry samples of the hybrid transam contain a larger amount of chlorophyll b than chlorophyll a, and of the hybrid mae-stro contain larger amounts of anthocyanins and polymeric dyes compared with fresh red cabbage. Dried cabbage has a high nutritional and biological value, and the obtained dried product is greatly appreciated and interesting for the European and world markets.ReferencesCaunii, A., Cuciureanu, P., Zakap, A.

In fact, Anatolia is believed to be the birthplace of vineyards and winemaking. The earliest records regard-ing Anatolian wine production dates back to the Neolith-ic age (Ozdemir, 2015). Currently, Turkey ranks fourth in the world in terms of area devoted to viticulture and fifth regarding the harvested grape tonnage (Peri et al., 2015). Grapes of local varieties such as Kalecik karasi, Bogaz-kere, Okuzgozu, and Papazkarasi are the popular native Turkish cultivars of Vitis vinifera L. and they are used along with those of French origin for wine production in Turkey. The color of its fruits is black with gray bloom (Bozan et al., 2008; Peri et al., 2015). On the other hand, the interest on fruit wines, which are produced from fruits other than grapes, has also been recently increasing. A fruit wine can be considered as a biotechnological product of yeast fer-mentation of natural sugars present in the fruit juice. Gen-erally, the process forfruit wine production resembles that of grape wines. Consequently, a non-grape fruit wine is a mixture com-posed of fruit juice, alcohol, and a wide range of biomole-cules that may already be present in the fruit or be biosyn-thesized during the fermentation process (Amid\u017ei\u0107 Klari\u0107 et al., 2015; Kalkan Yildirim, 2006). Individuals are ad-vised to boost their intake of dietary antioxidants, since they play a major role in increasing the body\u2019s antioxidant potential and to provide protection against the harmful ef-fects of oxidative stress (Willcox et al.,  2004). Recent ep-idemiological data have clearly indicated that regular con-sumption of wine in moderate amounts may have positive effects on health care. This health-promoting effect is gen-erally attributed to their rich phenolic content and antiox-idant effect (Naissides et al., 2006). The antioxidant po-tential of wine is closely related to its phenols content, which may be affected by a number of factors, including grape variety, fermentation processes, vinification tech-niques, ageing, and geographical and environmental fac-tors (soil type and climate). In this study, selected Anato-lian red wines and fruit wines were assayed for their poly-phenols contents. Materials and methodsStandard materials of gallic acid (1), chlorogenic acid (2), epigallocatechin (3), caffeic acid (4), vanillin (5), p-coumaric acid (6), rutin (7) and quercetin (8) were pur-chased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Lou-is, MO, USA). Ortho-phosphoric acid (85%) solution, eth-anol (HPLC gradient grade) and methanol (HPLC gradient grade) were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Ultrapure water for preparation of mobile phase (18.2 M\u03a9.cm at 25 \u00b0C) was obtained by using Millipore Sim-plicity UV apparatus (Millipore , Molsheim, France).The e\u0131ght analytes stock solutions were prepared by dissolving weighed amount of the standard substance in ethanol at 1mg/mL concentration value. All stock solutions were stored in a refrigerator at 4 \u00b0C. Combined working solutions of mixed analytes at the concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 \u00b5g/ml were obtained by dilution of appropri-ate volume of stock solutions in volumetric flasks. Calibra-tion curves were plotted, in triplicate, by analysing these standard solutions prepared freshly. Concentration values of the quality control samples (QC) were 7.5, 30 and 80 \u00b5g/ml. Chromatographic experiments were performed by using Agilent 1260 HPLC system consisting of a quaterna-ry pump model G1311B, an auto injector model G1329B, S3 PP 156332Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 331 - 332 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsa thermostated column compartment model G1316A and a diode array detector (DAD) model G4212B. The chro-matograms was monitored and integrated by using Agile-nt ChemStation software. Chromatographic separations of analytes was achieved on an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB- C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m particle size) and the column was thermostated at 25\u00b11 \u00b0C during analysis. DAD signals for every analyte were selected acoording to their spectrums obtained from Agilent ChemStation Soft-ware. Appropriate wavelenghts were selected as: 214 nm for gallic acid, chlorogenic acid and quercetin, 306 nm for vanillin, p-coumaric acid and rutin, 333 nm for chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid. Gradient elution system was used to separate all analytes. For this purpose two different mobile phase were used; Mobile phase A was 10mM phosphor-ic acid solution and mobile phase B was methanol using a flow rate of 1ml/min. The optimised gradient programme was as follows: 0\u201315 min (0-60% B), 15\u201320 min (60\u201380% B), 20.0\u201322 min (80-100% B), 22\u201327 min (100\u20130% B) and 27\u201332 min (0% B). Samples were injected into the system as 10 \u00b5l. Both fruit wines and grape wine of Papazkarasi type cultivar were purchased from local producers in Tur-key. After removal of alcohol by using a rotatory evapora-tor, the residual part of each wine was lyophilized. The ly-ophilized extracts were dissolved in water at proper con-centrations prior the experimentation.Results and discussionTo achieve the best separation different mobile phas-es were investigated like buffers, organic solvents and dif-ferent concentrations and different mixtures of these solu-tions. 10 mM phosphoric acid solution was used as mobile phase A and methanol was used mobile phase B for fur-ther experiments. On the other hand, other chromatograph-ic conditions like flow rate, injection volume and tempera-ture were investigated. At the end of experiments optimum parameters were determined as 1 ml/min for flow rate, 10 \u00b5L for injection volume and 25\u00b0C for temperature provid-ing the best separation of eight phenolic compounds. In the light of this information system suitability test results were investigated before validation studies. Six replicate analy-sis of this standard mixture was performed. Different con-centration values of each phenolic compounds were inves-tigated to determine dynamic range for the method devel-oped. For this purpose standard solutions of each analyte as a mixture were prepared daily by diluting from stock solution of compounds. Chromatograms obtained for each standard mixture were recorded and investigated to deter-mine calibration parameters of the method. Accuracy stud-ies for the method developed was performed by three re-petitive analyzing samples of known concentration at three different level as low, medium and high level in dynam-ic range. For this purpose standard mixtures of each com-pund at three different concentration values were prepared by diluting stock solution and concentration values were as 7.5, 30 and 80 \u00b5g/mL. Precision of the method was investi-gated bythe way of RSD values obtained from three repeti-tive analysis of known amount of standards at three differ-ent level. These RSD values for inra-day studies were low-er than 1% value that the method very precise in intra-day studies. The specifity of the method was demonstrated by using spiked wine extract samples. For this purpose each standard solution was spiked to same wine extract and ana-lyzed. It was observed that materials being in wine extract samples do not present overlapping peaks with eight phe-nolic compounds.The method developed and optimized was applied for analysis of eight different phenolic com-pound in different wine extract samples.ConclusionThe method developed was sensitive, accurate and sensitive for analysis of these phenolic constituents in dif-ferent wine samples.ReferencesAmid\u017ei\u0107 Klari\u0107, D., Klari\u0107, I., Mornar, A.,  Nigovi\u0107, B., 2015.

Cyclodextrin-based nanoassemblies as drug carriersSupramolecular cyclodextrin-based nanoassemblies mediated by host-guest interactions have gained increased popularity because of their \u201cgreen\u201d and simple preparation procedure, as well as their versatility in terms of inclusion of active molecules (Gref et al., 2012). Here we show that original nanoparticlesof around 100 nm are spontaneously prepared in water, by a lock and key mechanism involving formation of inclusion complexes between CDs on one wa-ter-soluble polymer and hydrophobic side chains on anoth-er one (Anand  et al., 2012; Battistini et al., 2008; Daoud-Mahammed et al., 2009; Fraix et al., 2013; Othman et al., 2011). Whatever the mixing conditions, nanoparticles with narrow size distributions arespontaneously formed upon the contact of two polymeric aqueous solutions. Ad-vantageously, the production of the nanoparticles can be scaled-up using a microfluidic device. In situ size measure-ments helped understanding the mechanisms involved in nanoparticle self-assembly. Individual nanoparticle track-ing analysis enabled to establish that despite the non-co-valent nature of the nanoassemblies, they were remarkably stable, even upon extreme dilution (few ng/mL). Contrast agents bearing adamantly moieties were incorporated into the nanoassemblies, showing high relaxivities (Battistini et al., 2008). Spectroscopic and photophysical studies helped understanding the interactions involved in the nanoassem-blies loaded or not with drugs (Anand et al., 2012). Final-ly, another set of examples shows the utility of the nano-assemblies for bimodal anticancer phototherapy (Fraix et al., 2013).ConclusionThis study paves the way towards the \u201cgreen\u201d scal-able formation of supramolecular assemblies with poten-tial uses in cosmetics and drug delivery.ReferencesAnand, R., Manoli, F., Manet, I., Daoud-Mahammed, S., Agostoni, V., R.Gref, S.

Both natural geomaterials and their deriva-tives are attracting growing attention in a variety of fields and in particular as biomaterials. Pharmaceutical technolo-gy is not an exception and geo-source excipients are com-peting well with the synthetic materials.Pharmaceutical uses of geomaterials: from conventional to innovativeFor thousands of years, humans have been using avail-able substances to achieve specific functions, including their use in contact with living tissues, organisms or mi-cro-organisms. Like most of the materials used by humans, geomaterials are widely mentioned in the literature, and occasionally exploited clinically, as such, as devices or as part of devices to treat trauma and diseases. These classi-cal used of geomaterials in health care applications will be revised.In recent decades, research in biomaterials and their use in healthcare have increased all over the world. Ap-plications of biomaterials in human healthcare include the development of new medical devices and prostheses, tis-sue engineering, bone regeneration, implants and surgi-cal tools, diagnostic techniques, bioadhesives, artificial or-gans and drug delivery (Larsson et al., 2007). Biomateri-als for medical applications must be biocompatible, and ei-ther bioresorbable or biodurable. Nanotechnologies and in-organic\u2013organic hybrid technologies are currently two of the most active approaches to achieve these requirements. Many organic\u2013inorganic hybrid materials and nanotech-nology based targeted drug delivery systems imply the use of geomaterials. Arrangement, structure and properties of pharmaceutically interesting geomaterialsSome geomaterials, and significantly carbonates (and carbon structures), phosphates and silicates (special clays and zeolites) induce no adverse effect in contact with a liv-ing organism (biocompatibility) and their presence may be beneficial (bioactivity) or without any significant health ef-fect (bio-inert) but with biodurable properties. The specif-ic function that a geomaterial have in any formulation de-pends on its composition, structure and properties, includ-ing both physical properties (particle size and shape, spe-cific surface area, texture,\u2026) and chemical features (sur-face chemistry, charge,\u2026).Calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate are natural nanosized geomaterials than can be used in drug delivery and tissue engineering. Calcium phosphate nanoparticles can be tailored to be biocompatible and show high adsorp-tion capacities to be used in controlled and targeted drug release.It must be also remarked all the possibilities in med-icine of graphitic forms deriving from graphene as fuller-enes, carbon nanotubes and graphite. The possibilities of these carbon materials in health care products are a new frontier of pharmaceutics (Hong et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2012; S\u00e1nchez et al., 2012).S4 OP 158338Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 337 - 338 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsCalcium carbonate appears as three different anhy-drous crystalline polymorphs: calcite, aragonite, and vat-erite. Under standard conditions for temperature and pres-sure, calcite is the stable phase, while aragonite and vater-ite are the metastable forms that readily transform into the stable phase. Vaterite and other polymorphic forms of car-bonate are receiving great attention as nanocarriers in drug delivery.Silicates, including some tectosilicates, as zeolites (Cerri et al., 2016), but mainly phyllosilicates (clay min-erals) have also featured in pharmaceutics due to their ad-sorptive and ion exchange properties (Aguzzi et al., 2007). These minerals appear abundantly at the surface of the Earth as natural nanoscale particles with layered structures and interlayer spaces, which have potential to play a sig-nificant role as biomaterials. Structurally, the layers, with thickness around one nanometre, consist in most cases of one or two tetrahedral silicate sheets and one octahedral metal oxide/hydroxide sheet. Many clay minerals form sheet-like particles or platelets, for example, kaolinite (a 1:1-type clay mineral) formed by one tetrahedral sheet and one octahedral sheet, or talc, vermiculite, montmorillonite or saponite and others (2:1-type clay minerals), which are composed of an octahedral sheet sandwiched between two tetrahedral silicate sheets. Chemically, clay minerals are hydrous aluminium or magnesium phyllosilicates, usually with variable amounts of iron, magnesium, alkali metals, alkaline earths, and other cations present either in the in-terlayer space or in the lattice framework by isomorphous substitution. Uses of clay minerals in healthcare include traditional applications but also, as a result of the nano-metre-scale layering, interlayer spacing and strong electro-static interactions, the possibility of developing functional materials for such advanced technologies as nanotechnol-ogy and, in particular, biomaterials. Clay minerals and ze-olites have been proposed as carriers of drugs, genes and proteins (L\u00f3pez-Galindo and Viseras, 2004). The investi-gation of geomaterials\u2013drug interaction and release mech-anisms is an essential contribution for the formulation of geomaterial-based drug delivery systems. The possibilities of such systems depend on the amount of drug retained by the geomaterial as well as on the release kinetics and the total amount released in regard of the therapeutic regime.Some polymorphic forms of silicates resulted in struc-tures with particular interest. As for example, natural min-eral nanotubes comprise hollow tubular minerals with na-noscale diameters.Modification, functionalization and polymer conjugation of geomaterials.Sometimes, properties of natural geomaterials cannot achieve the desired objectives, requiring their modification or functionalization as well as the incorporation into poly-meric matrices to obtain nanocomposites with improved properties compared to the individual components (Viseras et al., 2008). All these improvements are notably prompt-ing the availability of optimized and well characterized geomaterial-derivatives, suitable for a wide range of bio-medical applications.Concluding remarksThe therapeutic advantages of geomaterials in the de-sign and development of technologically advanced drug products make this field of investigation a high-priority de-velopment area in which the development of new applica-tions will require the close collaboration of pharmaceutical technologist with geologist, and chemists.ReferencesAguzzi, C., Cerezo, P., Viseras, C., Caramella, C., 2007.

The factors foremost in the planning and design phases were the current regulatory climate for PET radio-pharmaceutical production, radiation safety issues, and ef-fective production flow. A medium-energy cyclotron (16.5 MeV) was installed in a bunker with the high-proton ener-gy to offer a higher product radioactivity. This new state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Institute and with included research capabilities is dedicated to pro-viding the highest quality of nuclear imaging research.Positron emission tomography in the last decade is one of the most promising methods of detecting oncological, cardiological, neurological diseases and enters slowly in the other fields showing hopeful results. The introduction of the new radiopharmaceutical for diagnosis and therapy in the clinical practice including the clinical trials are pos-sible only with the appropriate production site according all cGMP requirements. The new University Institute for Positron Emission To-mography is in the final official establishment as a unique facility in the country and in the Balkan Region. The new facility is result of the Government investment and joint project with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Methodology Establishing a PET institution is a large scale process that requires careful planning, inputs from multiple stake-holders, the support and approval of the authorities, secure funding, and a detailed implementation strategy. The need for a carefully planned strategy is even more essential in the conditions prevailing in a developing country, where the introduction of PET may be impeded by a scarcity of fi-nancial resources and, in many cases, an inadequate under-standing of the potential roles and contributions PET imag-ing can play in a health care system.Our new institution integrates Department for Produc-tion of Radiopharmaceuticals and Department of Molecu-lar Imaging. They are connected in one unique system of Radiation protection, QA, BMS, Informatics and technical and administrative support of the network from the unified Health Care System in the country (IAEA, No.1, 2009).S4 OP 159340Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 339 - 340 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsResults The facility include cyclotron (GE, PET trace 860) for production of ultra-short-lived isotopes (F-18, C-11, N-13 and optional for solid targets that is planned already during the construction). Adjacent to the cyclotron is an area that houses the support equipment and a large dedicated work-shop to support machine maintenance and target develop-ment. The Radiopharmacy production site contains two clean room with controlled-air environment class 10,000 (M5.5) and access via an interlocking entry change area. One completely dedicated for FDG production and sec-ond for the production of other F18, C-11, N-13, Ga-68 ra-diopharmaceuticals and Cu-64. The third production labo-ratory is dedicated for small scale production of diagnos-tic and therapeutical radiopharmaceuticals for clinical tri-als and investigation (White S, 2016). A fully shielded hot cells (class 100 [M3.5]) is located in all clean rooms. The PET radiopharmaceuticals are delivered via shielded tub-ing between the synthesizers and hot cells. Inside the hot cells, there is an automated device for dispensing the PET radiopharmaceuticals into either a bulk-activity vial or a unit-dose syringe (IAEA 2008). The dispensed PET radio-pharmaceutical then passes through a hatch to a dedicat-ed area where it is packaged for in-house use or commer-cial distribution. Unit doses for in-house patients are trans-ported via elevator to the PET imaging area away. There is extensive radiation area monitoring throughout the facili-ty that continuously measures radiation levels (IAEA No.1, No.58, 2009).The integrated parts are two QC laboratories well equipped and one research laboratory for preclinical inves-tigation including toxicological studies of new radiophar-maceuticals and imaging of small animal models.The Department of Molecular Imaging is located in the second floor with two PET/CT cameras dedicated for clinical investigation and advanced biomedical imaging in human using extensive suite of state-of-the-art internally produced radiopharmaceuticals as imaging tools (IAEA 2010, Calabria and Schillaci, 2016).This institution will be the full partner to the physi-cians not only in the country, but also in the region.PET in that condition may serve as a magnet for re-cruitment in many areas and promote national and inter-national interdisciplinary cooperation, to provide universi-ty educational opportunities for master, doctoral and post-doctoral studies, specialties in Nuclear Medicine, Radio-pharmacy and Medical Physics with distinctive strength in education and research and an entrepreneurial dimension.ConclusionThe University Institute for Positron Emission Tomog-raphy in Skopje will move a nationally and international-ly recognized unit with true integration of research and ser-vice to the high level. The heath care for patients will be improved in many aspects and will help keeping the PET at the forefront of imaging procedures. Our Institute will serve as a model for future and more widespread clinical use of PET radiopharmaceuticals and provide proficiencies how PET technology may facilitate research and develop-ment opportunities.ReferencesInternational Atomic Energy Agency, Quality Assurance for PET and PET/CT systems.

Mini-tab-lets proved to be suitable dosage forms for targeted pa-tient groups such as pediatrics, geriatrics and hospitalized patients since they may offer ease in swallowing (alone or mixed with soft food) and flexible dosing regarding age/weight/condition. When formulated as multiple unit sys-tems, mini-tablets offer broad GIT distribution, less signifi-cant \u2018\u2019all or nothing\u2019\u2019 effect and combining different release kinetics/compounds in one system (Aleksovski et al., 2015).Hot-melt extrusion (HME) using circular dies and sub-sequent extrudate cut is emerging as promising technolo-gy in the production of mini-matrices aimed to deliver API by modified fashion. HME is solvent free process based on mixing, kneading, melting and transporting powdered ma-terials through a pre-heated barrel equipped with one or two rotating screws up to an end plate die which determines fi-nal size and shape of the extrudate (Repka et al., 2012).The aim of this research was to develop and evaluate mini-matrices based on either glyceryl behenate (GB) or glyceryl palmitostearate (GPS) for extended drug release of highly soluble model drug metoprolol tartrate. Mini-ma-trices were produced by two different techniques: hot-melt extrusion (mini-extrudates, EX) and compression of mini-tablets from untreated powder mixtures (direct compressed mini-tablets, DCMT) or granules obtained by milling ex-trudates (granule based mini-tablets, GMT).Materials and methodsThe following materials were used: metopro-lol tartrate (MPT, EsteveQuimica) (20-40%), glyceryl behenate(GB, Compritol 888 ATO, Gattefosse) or glycer-yl palmitostearate(GPS, Precirol ATO 5, Gattefosse) (80-60%), colloidal Si dioxide (0.5% in extrudates and tablets) and magnesium stearate (1% in tablets). The last two were replacing suitable amount of the glyceride.Production methods: HME was performedon a co-ro-tating twin screw extruder with pre-heated barrel segments (entry to die T\u00b0C, GB EX -77/75/75/75/72/66 and GPS EX - 57/57/57/55/53/50). Obtained strains (d=3mm) were manually cut into mini-extrudates of 3 or 5 mm height. Mini-tablets (30 mg, d = 4mm) were produced on a single punch tablet press by compressing untreated powder mix-tures (DCMT) or milled extrudates (GMT) 3kN compres-sion force. When investigating influence of granule size on drug release, GMT samples were prepared by granules in the range of 0.150 mm \u2264 d \u2264 0.250 mm (GMT S) or gran-ules ranging 0.500 mm \u2264 d \u2264 0.750 mm (GMT L).Evaluation methods: Drug release studies (USP I) were carried out in H2O, 0.1 M HCl, phosphate buffer pH 6.8, FESSIF with addition of pancreatin and CaCl2 and blank FESSIF (without pancreatin, CaCl2, lechitin, and Na tauro-cholate). Calculation of similarity factor f2 was performed. Solid state studies were performed using DSC and X-ray diffracttometry. Drug- glyceride interactions were evaluat-ed by ATR-FTIR, while drug distribution by Raman map-ping. Matrix porosity was determined by microcomputed tomography (\u03bcCT). Stability testing was performed at room and accelerated conditions in vapor protective bags.S4 OP 160342Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 341 - 342 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsResults and discussionHME and granule compression proved to be robust and reliable techniques when producing mini-matrices for ex-tended drug release in all drug to glyceride ratios. Direct compression was seen as unsuitable technique due to poor flow properties of powders. Drug release from both fresh-ly produced GB and GPS EX, GMT and DCMT was affect-ed by the MPT loading.Increasing the loading (from 20% up to 40%) led into faster drug delivery, supposedly  due to increase in system\u2019s hydrophilicity and formation of more open pore structure and thus more rapid MPT leaching in the medium. Formulations produced by melting technology (EX and GMT) provided increased embedment of the drug in the hydrophobic carrier and thus provided slower extend-ed release pattern compared to formulations made by direct compression (DCMT). EX and GMT formulations based on 20% MPT were chosen for further studies due to most suit-able prolonged drug release outcome over 24 hours. DCMT was not selected as further platform due to abovementioned problems with poor flow properties and the low extent of drug release retardation. When comparing the delivery of 20% MPT form either GB or GPS units, GBEX  and GB GMT matrices gave similar delivery patterns between them-selves (square root of time pattern, f2=72) while in case of GPS EX and GPS GMT release outcomes were versatile with EX sample showing specific sigmoidal release fash-ion and GMT square root of time release profile (f2=28). The sigmoidal outcome could be related to the appearance of \u2018\u2019wall depletion\u2019\u2019 effect, where due to shearing appear-ance at the inner surface of the extruder MPT is emerging towards the extrudateinterior leaving very thin layer con-taining mainly glyceride which behaves as a diffusion bar-rier and thus limits drug release just from the cut sides of the matrix surface. During dissolution GPS EX cracks (af-ter 8 h) which provides faster delivery rate and thus appear-ance of sigmoidal release pattern.  GB EX and GB GMT showed higher porosity and thus faster drug release com-pared to the same units based on GPS. Porosity of GB EX is probably high enough to overcome the \u2018\u2019wall depletion\u2019\u2019 ef-fect. GB EX has more porous and less dense surface appear-ance compared to GPS EX. Milling the EX breaks the thin glyceride layer and thus disable its action as diffusion barri-er and results in faster release profile of GPS GMT sample. Solid state properties (thermal and diffractional) of fresh-ly produced matrices were slightly different than the ones of physical mixtures and also pointed partial solubilisation of MPT in the molten glyceride. Raman mapping and ATR-FTIR measurements indicated uniform drug distribution through either GB or GPS matrices and no significant inter-actions between the drug and used glycerides, respectively. Increasing the size of the EX from 3mm to 5mm in both GB and GPS samples led into decreased delivery rate due to in-creased diffusion route and decreased specific surface area of the units. Increasing the size of the granules in GB GMT led to faster release pattern of GB GMT L compared to GB GMT S due to higher porosity and larger pores of first ones compared to last ones. GPS GMT showed in general low-er porosity compared to GB GMT and thus probably bet-ter compactibility of GPS granulate, which minimized the impact of the particle size on the drug delivery profile. GB units were insignificantly affected by the pH of the dissolu-tion medium and presence of biorelevant compounds while GPS samples demonstrated faster delivery rate in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 compared to 0.1 M HCl and in FESSIF com-pared to blank FESSIF. Glycerides having higher acid num-ber (GPS \u2264 6mg KOH/g vs GB \u2264 4mg KOH/g) and shorter fatty acid chains (GPS: C16 and C18 vs GB: C22) tend to ex-hibit increased ionization at phosphate buffer pH (decreas-ing hydrophobicity) and are more prone to lypolisis respec-tively, therefore giving slightly faster drug release outcome. Storing of GB units and GPS units at increased temperature for two months provoked changes in glyceride\u2019s solid state properties (GB \u2013 thermal changes: increased enthalpy and melting point maximum; GPS \u2013thermal changes: increased enthalpy and peak maximum and change in the peak appear-ance; x-ray pattern changes), which was related to the alter-ations seen in the unit\u2019s drug release outcome after storage. GB units gave slower drug release probably due to bloom-ing effect, while GPS units gave faster release probably due to increase in unit\u2019s porosity after storage. Storing units at room conditions affected only GPS samples,leading to fast-er drug release compared to freshly prepared units.Drug re-lease changes were again connected to changes in the sol-id state properties of the glyceride. After thermal process-ing glycerides appear in a layered forms with lower crystal-linityand are with time and other factors (increased temper-ature) transformed to a more stable state. Glycerides com-posed of longer fatty acid chains such as GB tend to change their crystalline form slower and at more extreme environ-ment conditions, while glycerides based on shorter fatty acid chains such as GPS are prone to faster crystal altera-tions already at less extreme conditions.ConclusionObtained results outline GB as more reliable matrix for-mer for developing extended release mini-matrices com-pared to GPS. HME appeared as robust and reproducible process for mini-matrix production. However, understand-ing of material features and, HME equipment, process opti-mization and coupling with suitable down-stream processing are prerequisites for successful introduction of this technique as a viable alternative to the compression of mini-tablets.ReferencesAleksovski, A., Dreu, R., Ga\u0161perlin, M., Planin\u0161ek, O., 2015.

The pulsatile drug de-livery system is intended to deliver a rapid drug release af-ter a predetermined lag time (Kalantzi et al., 2009). Sim-ple and inexpensive production methods, such as compres-sion-coating of tablets, might be effective for these formu-lations to gain widespread use. Compression-coated tablets are composed of an inner core (immediate release tablet) which is embedded in an outer coating shell containing ei-ther a hydrophilic, hydrophobic or a mixture of both poly-mers, that dissolves or disintegrates slowly to produce the lag time. The outer layer surrounds the inner core, there-fore selection of the outer layer materials has a significant impact on the performance of the tablet, including the me-chanical strength, drug release characteristics, and tablet stability (Lin and Kawashima, 2012).The possibility of formulating compression-coat-ed tablets of verapamil hydrochloride was examined us-ing polyethylene oxide (PEO) as polymer in the outer lay-er. The influence of different types and concentrations of polyethylene oxides (PEOs) on the drug release rate was investigated. Verapamil hydrochloride was selected as the model drug since the symptoms of hypertension are more prevalent during the early hours of the morning and devel-opment of chronotherapeutic formulation could be useful to fulfill the needs of drug delivery at the required time.Materials and MethodsMaterialsDifferent grades of polyethylene oxide polymers \u2013 Polyox\u00ae WSR 1105 (Mr ~ 0.9 x 106) and Polyox\u00ae WSR 301 (Mr ~ 7 x 106) were kindly provided by the manufac-turer (Dow Chemical Company, USA). Verapamil Hydro-chloride (Ph. Eur. 8.0), direct compression excipient based on coprocessed lactose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (Ludi-press\u00ae, BASF AG, Germany), and anhydrous colloidal sil-icon dioxide (AEROSIL\u00ae 200 Pharma, EVONIK Indus-tries AG, Germany) were used for the tablets preparation.MethodsPreparation of tablet cores and compression-coated tabletsThe inner cores of the compression-coated tablets were prepared by direct compression on an eccentric tableting machine (Korsch EK-0, Germany) using 9 mm concave punches. Tableting blend consisted of verapamil hydro-chloride (30% w/w), anhydrous colloidal silicon dioxide (1% w/w) and Ludipress\u00ae as a diluent.Compression-coated tablets consisted of the core tab-let and the PEO polymer (Polyox\u00ae WSR 1105 or Polyox\u00ae WSR 301) as the outer coating agent.  F 1 and F 2 batches were prepared using Polyox\u00ae WSR 1105 with core: poly-mer at the following ratios 1:1 and 1:2, respectively. Batch-S4 OP 161344Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 343 - 344 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationses P 1 and P 2 were prepared using Polyox\u00ae WSR 301 with core: polymer at the same ratios 1:1 and 1:2, respectively. Firstly, half of the amount of the polymer (outer layer) was placed in the die to make a powder bed. Then, the core tab-let was carefully placed in the centre of the die and the re-maining half of the polymer was filled into the die. The contents were then compressed using the eccentric tablet-ing machine (Korsch EK-0, Germany) to form a flat-faced tablet with a diameter of 12 mm.In vitro drug release studies The prepared core and compression coated tablets were subjected to in-vitro drug release studies in suitable dissolution media to assess their ability to provide the de-sired release. The in-vitro drug release study of the core tablets was performed in the rotating paddle apparatus (Er-weka DT600, Germany). The dissolution medium was 900 mL of phosphate buffer (pH=6.8) maintained at tempera-ture 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C, and the rotating paddle speed was 50 rpm. The in-vitro drug release study of the compression coated tablets was performed in the reciprocating cylinder appara-tus (VanKel\u2019s Bio-Dis, USA). The dissolution medium was 250 mL of 0.1 N HCl for the first 2 h followed by 6.8 pH phosphate buffer for the remaining period. Temperature of the medium was maintained at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C, and the dpm rate was set at 10 dpm.In all experiments, an aliquot of 5 mL sample was withdrawn at the predetermined time intervals and re-placed with an equal volume of drug-free dissolution fluid in order to maintain the sink conditions. The samples were filtered and analyzed spectrophotometrically at 273 nm by using UV/VIS spectrophotometer Evolution 300 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cambridge, UK). The amounts released were expressed as a percentage of the drug content.Results and discussionThe prepared core tablets showed immediate release with more than 80% of the drug released in less than 15 minutes. With compressed-coated tablets, different re-lease patterns were obtained using either different polymer type or polymer concentration. It was observed that the lag time increased as the concentration of the PEO in the out-er coat increased. For instance, formulation F 1 had a lag time of 2 hrs before burst release. On the other hand, F 2 had lag time of 4 hrs. For batches P 1 and P 2, the results indicated that that the burst release of the drug occurred at 3 and 6 hrs, respectively. This also confirms that the lag time increased as the concentration of the PEO in the out-er coat increased, but this increase were different with dif-ferent types of polymers. An increased molecular weight leads to increase in polymer chain length and greater de-gree of chain entanglement, therefore stronger gel layers are formed in contact with water (Colorcon, 2009). Stron-ger gel layer with the greater viscosity decreases drug dif-fusion rate and water diffusion within the core tablet which consequently delays the drug release. Lower molecular weight PEOs form weaker gel layer, which is more sus-ceptible to erosion. There is no general rule for selection of the appropriate polymer concentration that should be op-timized taking into account the formulation composition, polymer molecular weight and drug solubility.ConclusionIn the present investigation, compression-coated tab-lets with Polyox\u00ae WSR 1105 and Polyox\u00ae WSR 301 in outer layer showed delayed-release, and drug release from formulated tablets showed the dependence on both poly-mer concentration and its molecular weight. Further op-timization of the Polyox\u00ae WSR 1105 and Polyox\u00ae WSR 301 coated tablets could produce the desired predeter-mined lag time.ReferencesColorcon, 2009.

Optimal crystal form of API inter-actively interrelates and impacts its aqueous solubility and dissolution rate that are benchmark for drug delivery and absorption determining the extent of its bioavailability and pharmacokinetics profile. Determining the crystal struc-ture and revealing the crystal packing forces and geometry of the API has impact its physicochemical properties. This approach is the criteria for assessment of the performance of the API. The range of crystal forms in which molecular co-crystals of APIs may exist is advantageous comparing to their polymorphs, salts, solvates and hydrates due to the vast number of potential co-formers which extend the lim-ited counterions for salt formation implying the existence of more complex intermolecular interactions based on dif-ferent H-bonding patterns with API that lead to conforma-tional changes and flexibility for crystal packing in process of co-crystallization.Co-crystallization became well known bottom-up ap-proach starting from intermolecular interactions among either selected neutral, ionic or zwitterionic molecules to design and control the properties of the multicomponent crystals (Braga, 2004). In the scope of interest for drug de-sign and formulation, Good et al. (2009) and Cheney et al. (2011) emphasized that the main advantage for designing pharmaceutical co-crystals  (PCCs) is, through their mod-ulating  properties, to improve the performance of the na-tive APIs such are: biopharmaceutical profile (solubili-ty and dissolution rate), thermodynamical stability (phase transition of polymorphs, solvate/ hydrate formation, de-composition) or bulk powder processability (flowability, compressibility, particle size and shape control). Childs et al. (2007) has pointed out the necessity co-crystals (CCs) semantically to be classify based on accomplishments in research of supramolecular chemistry. This approach en-lightens the complex reality of multi-component systems and the wide scope associated between salts and co-crys-tals, and their differences based on the location of the trans-ferred proton within the salt - co-crystal continuum. Biguanide drugs are well known and wide used oral antidiabetic drugs for oral therapy of diabetes type-2 that directly improve insulin action. Recent studies in the re-search work carried out by Vujic et al. (2015) has point-ed out that biguanides in combination with targeted in-hibitors in order to obtain synergy in reduction cell via-bility, inhibited tumor growth in the mutated neuroblasto-ma rat sarcoma oncogene (NRAS) protein from melano-ma cells. Hence, it is expected that combination of bigu-anides which affect activation of the AMP-activated pro-tein kinases (AMPK) and the regulation of energy metabo-lism with outcome to cell\u2019s energy sparing, in combination with other anti-cancer drug-models would influence direct blocking cell\u2019s signaling and hinder the resistance.Materials and methodsCo-crystallization screening reveals protocol was un-dertaken in order to grown single crystalline phases of PCCs composed of drug model metformin (MET), selected from biguanides class of drugs and coformers that belong to different pharmacotherapy and functional group class-es, respectively.Co-crystallization screening was carried out on apply-ing slow-rate solvent evaporation method for growing sin-S4 OP 162346Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 345 - 346 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsgle crystalline phases at room temperature with quality ab-solute structure to be determined. An equimolar quantity of MET and co-crystal partner was dissolved in the min-imum quantity of ethanol and left for slow evaporation at room temperature. Colorless crystals were observed after a few days.  For four MET PCC models, the methods of prepara-tion reproducible batches were optimized. The quality of batches was controlled by Powder x-ray diffractometer comparing the obtained experimental diffractograms with the same one that was theoretically generated from the sin-gle crystal for each of four PCC models.Single-crystal diffraction data were collected on a Nonius Kappa diffractometer equipped with a CCD de-tector with graphite-monochromatized MoK\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.71069 \u00c5). Intensities were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects. The structures were solved by direct methods with the SIR97 suite of programs and refinement were performed on F2 by full-matrix least-squares meth-ods with all non-hydrogen atoms anisotropic.Flow-cytometry was applied for measuring viability of the two PCC models.Results and discussionVujic et al. (2015) has carried out research for both pro-cancer and anti-cancer effects of  biguanides on cancer cells, indicating existence of association of the antidiabetic therapy and reduced risk of cancer in diabetic patients. Be-cause biguanide represents the \u03c0-conjugated system, MET can exist in three resonance-stabilized forms, i.e. as neutral molecule (MET), monoprotonated (MET+) or diprotonat-ed (MET2+) cation, with dissociation constants in water in range from pKa1 \u2248 12.00 to pKa2 \u2248 2.00.A search of the biguanide fragments in the structur-al literature, both in the CCDC (Cambridge Crystallogra-phy Database Center) database and in patents, shows that in crystals MET exists as   monoprotonated (MET+) or de-protonated (MET2+) but never in its neutral form MET. We have undertaken a systematic study of the crystal chemistry of MET with the aim of understanding its prop-erties in the solid state and finding relationships with its biopharmaceutical profile. We have determined the struc-tures of the 29 MET PCCs. Four of this MET PCC mod-els are \u201cdrug-drug\u201d type of co-crystals.  The ligand used for co-crystallyzation was from the following classes: inor-ganic acids (nitric, phosphoric and carbonic acid); organic NH-type acids (saccharine and acesulfame); organic OH-type acids (squaric and picric acid); monocarboxylic ac-ids (fumaric, acetic, trifluoroacetic, trichloroacetic, dichlo-roacetic, monochloroacetic, glycolic, salicylic, diclofenac) and dicarboxylic acids (oxalic, malonic, maleic, fumaric, succinic, adipic acid). ConclusionIn the paper are presented structure analyses for \u201cdrug-drug\u201d type of PCCs where both API and CF exhibit phar-macological effect. This approach of designing \u201cdrug-drug\u201d type of PCC aligned to the strategy for drug repo-sitioning, the idea for use of a drug for treating diseases other than the drug-specified. This concept was prompt-ed in 2012 through the Discovering New Uses for Exist-ing Molecules program, initiated by US\u2019s National Insti-tute of Health (NIH).The case study underlines the crystal growth and the method of preparation for \u201cdrug-drug\u201d type of PCCs wherein two different APIs cocrystallized in single crystal cell, and that represent new paradigm for approaching in development of \u201cfixed-doses\u201d or \u201ccombo\u201d pharmaceutical formulations. Preliminary results of the Structure-Activi-ty Relationship study on the co-crystals composed of MET with dichloroacetic acid indicate dual and complementary anti-cancer activities of the two selected drug models for co-crystallization.

Apart from its structure and function, relevant issues regarding the analytical methodologies applied for the as-sessment of the quality of this complex drug will be high-lighted as well. Rituximab is the first approved targeted biologic ther-apy for the treatment of haematological malignancies and it took very short time from its first description until the approval and clinical application. In USA it was approved in 1997, whereas in EU in 1998. Approved clinical indi-cations of rituximab include non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyan-giitis (European Medicines Agency-EMA, 2016). Since the patents on MabThera and Rituxan expire in 2016 in USA and have already expired (2013) in EU, there are some bio-similars of rituximab in the late stages of clinical trials de-veloped by companies worldwide, whereas \u2018non-origina-tor biologicals\u2019 of rituximab are approved in some South American and Asia countries (GaBI, 2016). Pharmaceuti-cal formulation (Rituxan or Mabthera) is administered in-travenously and supplied at a rituximab concentration of 10 mg/ml in either 10 ml or 50 ml single-use vials.Structure \u2013 activity relationship Rituximab is genetically engineered chimeric mono-clonal antibody (mAb) that is produced in mammalian cell culture using Chinese hamster ovary cells. This IgG1an-tibody contains murine light and heavy chain variable re-gions, and human gamma 1 heavy chain and kappa light chain constant regions. During the chimerization pro-cess, murine variable domain of heavy and light chain was cloned into the human IgG1 immunoglobulin framework. In the chimerised version only variable domains have mu-rine origin (around 30%). The rest of molecule is human (around 70%). Rituximab binds specifically to the antigen CD20, which is found on the surface of normal and malig-nant B-lymphocytes (Reff et al., 1994), which in addition play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B-cell lysis through complement-de-pendent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell me-diated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and apoptosis. As all biological drugs, rituximab has very complex na-ture, it contains 1328 amino acids with theoretical Mw of non- glycosylated form 144.54 kDa. It contains two identi-cal heavy and two identical light chains linked via disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain contains 451 amino acids (49.2 kDa) and pI 8.67, whereas each light chain contains 213 ami-no acids (23.06.kDa) and pI 8.26. The apparent Mw of ritux-imab is higher than 144.54 kDa, due to the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides attached in the N-glycosilation site at conserved asparagines N-301. Variable regions of both chains comprise complementarity determining regions (CDR1-3), being responsible for antigen recognition and binding. On the other hand, human Fc \u03b31 (IgG1) fragment is responsible for ADCC and CDC. Heavy chains are linked via two interchain disulfide bonds at the flexible hinge region, while heavy and light chains are linked with a disulfide bridge.

The main source of the antibody heterogeneity results from differenc-es in protein glycosylation which is one of the most common post-translational modifications of proteins produced in eu-karyotic cells although, primary structure variations, deami-nation, deamidation, lysine truncation, methionine oxidation, sulfation and phosphorilation can create additional IgG vari-ants. The characterization and stability study of rituximab are extensive and require a battery of orthogonal techniques as amino acid analysis, amino-terminal sequence analysis, peptide mapping, and analysis of oligosaccharides, ion-ex-change chromatography (IEC), cIEF, SDS-PAGE, and circu-lar dichroism (CD), UV spectroscopy, size exclusion chro-matography (SEC), cellular mediated cytotoxicity (CMC). The oligosaccharide structure was investigated by CZE and MALDI-TOF after isolation from HPAEC-PAD (Eu-ropean Medicines Agency-EMA, 2016). Two-dimension-al gel electrophoresis (2-DE) complemented with MALDI TOF MS analysis was used for the characterization of iden-tity, purity and structural integrity of rituximab. Experimen-tal data revealed typical migration behavior of mAbs, result-ing in poorly resolved spots with different isoelectric points and very small differences in Mw. Heavy chains migrated at about 50 kDa and light chains at about 23 kDa. After tryp-tic digestion of 2-DE separated proteins, peptide mass fin-gerprinting analysis was also used for the identification of rituximab heavy and light chains (Nebija et al., 2011). Gly-cosylation of IgG is critical for effector functions including complement fixation, Fc receptor binding on macrophages and ADCC. In addition clearance of IgG-antigen complexes from circulation is influenced by IgG glycosylation. It was shown that predominantly N-linked oligosaccharides pres-ent in rituximab belong to asialo, neutral complex biannte-nary oligosaccharide type different terminal galactose resi-dues, whereas terminal sialylated oligosaccharides are pres-ent only in minor amounts (Kamoda et al., 2004).Manufacturer of pharmaceutical product MabThera\u00ae as primary assay for characterization and lot release of N-linked glycans on glycoprotein drugs employed CE-LIF. A method for direct characterization of glycans using CE-LIF/MS has been reported, as well. Apart from major gly-can components this method allowed accurate identifica-tion of minor glycans such are asialo- and afucosylated spe-cies. Since the fucosilation affects biological activity and sialylation affects the pharmacokinetics of glycoprotein drugs, the identification of these species is of particular sig-nificance for the characterization of rmAbs. Charged vari-ants of rmAbs can be studied with different methods such as IEC, IEF, CZE. A simple and rapid method for determi-nation of relative amounts of rituximab glycoforms differ-ing in terminal galactose was reported. Most abundant ions corresponding to the glycoforms found on the rituximab heavy chain were monitored by mass selective detection in the selected-ion monitoring mode (Nebija et al., 2011).Lot release testing of the pharmaceutical product Rituxan included physicochemical and biological meth-ods, such as SDS-PAGE, peptide mapping, fragment IEC-HPLC, SECHPLC, glycan content, cIEF, CDC, UV-VIS. Validated human CDC assay was used for the determina-tion of potency. Galactose content on the heavy chain oli-gosaccharide was found to be critical parameter for biologi-cal activity, therefore another release test for glycan content was developed (CE-LIF). cIEF was used to positively iden-tify rituximab from other recombinant mAbs made by the manufacturer (US FDA CDER, 2016; Zhang et al., 2016).ConclusionAs a conclusion, since rituximab belongs to rmAbs, class of drugs obtained by rDNA technology, biological processes are involved in its production. Therefore it dem-onstrates high degree of inherent heterogeneity and com-plexity and the combination of different techniques should be used for the extensive characterization of its quality attri-butes, including identity, structural integrity, purity and sta-bility. This is of primary importance for the safety and effi-cacy of this class of drugs. In this regard, it was shown that gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting analy-sis may represent an important strategy for the assessment of the quality of rituximab and other biopharmaceuticals.

The guidance recommends continuing emollient therapy even when the skin appears healthy. Healthcare profession-als are advised to offer children with atopic eczema a re-gime of \u2018complete\u2019 emollient therapy involving a choice of non perfumed emollients to use every day, both as leave on moisturisers and as soap substitutes for routine wash-ing and bathing.Emollient formulations suitable for such use typically contain both oily occlusive substances, such as petrolatum, paraffin or mineral oil, which form a water impermeable film over the skin to decrease evaporation of physiologi-cal water from beneath, and humectant substances, such as glycerol and urea, which attract water to the skin (Cork, 2007; Loden, 2003; Rawlings et al., 2004; Watkins, 2008). In order to encourage treatment concordance, however, it is also crucially important that these products are formulat-ed in such a way that their physical characteristics render them appealing for patients to use over large surface areas and for long periods (Cork et al., 2003).Ideally, emollients should exert their skin softening and moisturising effects within the upper layers of the skin. Thick, greasy ointments undoubtedly exhibit good emollient characteristics, but are not very popular with pa-tients because they are not well absorbed into the skin and leave an oily residue which can feel uncomfortable and has a tendency to soil clothing and bed linen (Cork, 2007; Sidbury and Poorsattar, 2006). More popular emollients are formulated as oil-in-water creams or lotions to make them \u2018feel\u2019 lightweight and to encourage better absorption into the skin (Ersser et al., 2007). However, these dosage forms are less effective than ointments owing to their low-er oil content, resulting in reduced occlusive capabilities (Clark, 2004) Moreover, cream and lotion formulations ex-hibit poor substantivity and have a tendency to be easily rubbed off onto clothing, so they necessitate more frequent re-application than would be practicable for many patients. Emollient gels are alternative pharmaceutical presentations for atopic eczema sufferers and usually contain high con-centrations of oily ingredients in semi-solid aqueous sys-tems. To achieve maximum benefit, some of these gels, just like other emollients, need to be applied regularly and fre-quently.Performance evaluation methods for emollients and moisturisers are mainly focused on sensory aspects, skin visual appearance, perceived efficacy, and measurements of skin barrier hydration and integrity (Rawlings et al., 2004). However, few studies have involved patients di-rectly comparing the effectiveness of different emollients by using them concurrently or under conditions mimick-ing normal therapeutic use (Clark, 2004; Simpson, 2006). Consequently, the aim of this study was therefore to compare the effects on skin hydration of two emollients prescribed in the UK, DELP gel and ZB cream, and us-ing a dosage regimen consistent with most patients\u2019 prac-tical circumstances which limits their use of emollients to twice daily only. S4 OP 164350Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 349 - 350 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsMaterials and methodsThis was a single centre, randomised, double blind, concurrent bi-lateral (within-patient) comparison in 18 fe-males with atopic eczema and dry skin of similar severity on their lower legs. Following 7 days\u2019 run-in with no use of emollients or moisturisers on the lower legs, DELP gel and ZB cream were each applied to one lower leg twice daily (approximately at 9am and 9pm) for 4 days and on the morning only on day 5.  Washing of the lower legs was permitted only during the evening on days 2 and 4.  The efficacy of both products was assessed by hydration mea-surements using a Corneometer CM825 probe (Courage-Khazaka electronic). The measurements were made on days 1 to 5 at approximately 9am immediately prior to the first daily application (the measurement on day 1 being baseline), and around 1pm and 5pm. The primary efficacy variable was the area under the curve (AUC) of the change from baseline corneometer readings over the 5 days. Results and discussionThe two emollients showed very different effects on skin hydration. The AUC for DELP gel significantly out-performed ZB cream. For DELP gel, the skin hydration ef-fect was substantial, long lasting and cumulative, with the readings each day generally increasing over the treatment period.  Even the morning readings on days 3 and 5, fol-lowing washing the previous evening, were significantly better than baseline. In contrast, for ZB cream, skin hy-dration was not significantly different from baseline at any time point.ConclusionThis study, performed by subjects with atopic ecze-ma and dry skin using a dosage regimen simulating nor-mal/practical use, has demonstrated very significant per-formance differences between two marketed emollients. Whereas DELP gel achieved substantial, long lasting and cumulative skin hydration, ZB cream achieved no measur-able improvement compared to before treatment. Health-care professionals should be aware of this when prescrib-ing these products. ReferencesClark, C., 2004. How to choose a suitable emollient. Pharm. J. 273, 351-353. Cork, M.J., 2007.

The lack of a unique denomination should not be a serious problem, but behind these incon-sistencies are usually some different approaches concern-ing the ethiopathogeny, as well as the targeted pathogenic treatment by default. The literature data originating from European authors, as well as some articles of North Americans ones include the periorbital hypercolorations into the chronologic ag-ing process, with implications resulted from vascular and sanguine deficiencies. In other words, it is considered that this deficiency is not necessarily originating from a genet-ic anomaly. This point of view is due to the fact that most of the subjects from this geographic area are of pale or fair skin phototype (I, II or II phototypes). According to Suppa et al. (2011) the determinants of periorbital pigmentations and of the skin ageing processes are: UV exposure, smok-ing, vascular problems. Lupo et al. (2011) consider the in-trinsic aging role in the periorbital hyperpigmentations pa-thogeny and suggest a new topical treatment based on hu-man growth factors, cytokines, caffeine and glycyrrhetin-ic acid.On the other hand, literature data attributed to Asian or South American authors indicate that the primary cause of periorbital hypercolorations pathogeny should be rath-er melanic, constitutional, and they refer to as subocular melanosis. This is probably due to the dark skin phototype (IV, V and VI phototypes), specific in these geographic ar-eas. Some authors point-out the post-inflammatory pig-mentations\u2019 role onto color intensification of this pathoge-ny, while in other situations it is exclusively assigned to the melanic cause of this process (Kanika and Kassir, 2013). In the same time, in the case of subjects with dark skin pho-totype, it was stipulated that the main causes of periorbit-al hyperpigmentation could be melanic, without excluding the aging specific endogeneous processes as aggravating factors. Corroborating these different approaches, one could consider that the main determinants of periorbital hyper-pigmentations, for any skin phototype could be: the genet-ic melanic pigmentation, the post-inflammatory hyperpig-mentation, a tegument periorbital atrophy due to chrono-aging, the venous congestion, hemoglobin and oxygenated hemoglobin accumulations, hemosiderine deposit, as well as some other anatomic causes. Materials and methodsThe chemicals used in this study were of high puri-ty grade. Acetyl tetrapeptide-5 (trade name EYESERYL\u00ae) was obtained as a gift from Lipotec S.A. (Isaac Peral, 17 Pol. Ind. Cam\u00ed Ral; E-08850 Gav\u00e0 Barcelona, SPAIN) as 0.1% aqueous solution. An o/w microemulsion was used as vehicle for the transport of acetyl tetrapeptide-5 through the skin. The main ingredients of the microemulsion were: deionised water, glycerol, liquid paraffin, vaseline, jellify-ing and lubricant mineral agents, emulsifying agent (Mon-tanov L), preservative agents, and acetyl tetrapeptide-5. The rheological properties of the microemulsion were as-sessed using the Rheometer RC1 (Rheotec), and two type of probes: CC8 and C25-1. The study was carried-on on 2 test groups of healthy women volunteers aged of 22 to 64 years. The first group applied on both (right and left) eyes hemispheres the o/w S4 OP 165352Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 351 - 352 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsemulsion containing 0.1% peptidic complex, twice dai-ly, during 60 days. The second group (control) applied the cosmetic emulsion containing 0.1% acetyl tetrapeptide-5 only on the right eye suborbital area, while the left eye was treated with the simple cosmetic formulation. The effects of the cosmetic emulsion were evaluated every 15 days, both by clinical and instrumental methods. The instrumen-tal evaluation was performed by Mexametry, using the MX 18 Mexameter (Courage-Khazaka), which is able to mea-sure two components, mainly responsible for the color of the skin: melanin and haemoglobin (erythema). The aim of the present work was to study in vivo the efficiency of the acetyl tetrapeptide-5 in the treatment of periorbital hyperpigmentations and eye puffiness, using mexametry as one of the most recent non-invasive meth-od of evaluation of the coloration\u2019s intensity of the sub-or-bital area.Results and discussionIn our study, the melanin parameter was excluded due to the fact that acetyl tetrapeptide-5 is not considered as a melanic depigmentant, lacking any tyrosine inhibitor in this composition. Considering that periorbital hyperpig-mentations are dependent by individual metabolism, the relevant parameter used as a measure of suborbital color-ation was the erythem one.In the case of the control group, a significant reduction of the erythem values was obtained for the right eye, while for the left eye, the reduction of the erythem corresponding values was quite slight, or (in some cases) none, even at the end of the eight weeks of treatment. In the case of the study group which applied the o/w cosmetic emulsion containg the peptidic complex on both eyes hemispheres, significant reduction of the erythem values was recorded, in some cas-es even after 15 days of treatment. For this group, 25% of the volunteers showed a slight reduction, 30% a fairly good reduction, and 40% a good one.ConclusionIn conclusion, mexametry was successfully used as in-strumental non-invasive method for the investigation of periorbital hyperpigmentations as consequence of a spe-cific cosmeceutic treatment. The obtained results showed that the cosmetic formulation containing different amounts of acetyl tetrapeptide-5 was well tolerated at the tegument level and visible results were obtained, even after only 15 days of treatment. Moreover, 95 % of the volunteers showed a significant reduction of the periorbital hyperpig-mentations and eye puffiness after the treatment with the cosmetic preparation containing acetyl tetrapeptide-5.

Howev-er, the selection of an appropriate carrier for liposomes re-mains one of the most important issues. Although, gels are still considered as the most suitable bases for liposomes (Kulkarni, 2005), they are usually not appropriate, neither for the long-term care nor for all skin types. Therefore, emulsion systems are believed to be more convenient car-riers. On the other hand, formulation of an emulsion with liposomes entails another problem: selection of suitable emulsifier(s) necessary for system stabilization, consider-ing the fact that emulsifier may interfere with the mechan-ical stability of vesicles and may enhance propensity for fusion or lead to their solubilization (Kulkarni, 2005). An interesting and highly promising group of novel emulsifi-ers which could be used for development of emulsion car-riers for liposomes are alkyl polyglucosides (APGs). Due to their favorable toxicological and dermatological proper-ties they are considered as environment- and skin-friendly (Lukic et al., 2013). Therefore, our aim was to investigated whether a nov-el APG emulsifier, hydroxystearyl alcohol & hydroxystea-ryl glucoside, could be considered as an appropriate stabi-lizer for emulsions containing liposomes. To accomplish this, a model emulsion carrier with liposomes was formu-lated and characterized first. Additionally, the in vivo irri-tation potential of the developed formulation was assessed, as a certain aspect of safety of the used emulsifier.Materials and methodsHydroxystearyl alcohol & hydroxystearyl glucoside was used for samples\u2019 preparation with ARSC-liposomes-stem cells of alpine rose leaves in liposomes as an active.Two oil-in-water (o/w) creams (placebo Fp and active cream F1a containing 0.4% (w/w) of ARSC-liposomes) were developed and characterized by means of: polariza-tion microscopy, rheology, differential scanning calorime-try and thermogravimetric analysis as described (Lukic et al., 2013). Afterwards, an in vivo study with investigated creams and commercially available cream containing the same active was conducted. Skin hydration (EC), transepi-dermal water loss (TEWL), and erythema index (EI) were measured in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and relevant guidelines on 16 healthy volunteers.Results and discussionMicrographs taken after 7 days revealed randomly dis-tributed distorted Maltese crosses and birefringence at the oil droplets border (\u201conion rings\u201d) within both samples (Fp and F1a), indicating lyotropic interaction of lamellar type (Lukic et al., 2013) and remained relatively unaltered after 30 days. However, obtained micrographs showed the no-ticeable difference in the colloidal structure between the placebo Fp and the active cream F1a. Considering that li-posomes are also visible under polarization microscopy, it seems that liposome-similar structures could be observed near the lamellar phase gel network i.e. close to the \u201con-ion rings\u201d in the continual aqueous phase. Intact vesicles were apparently immobilized within the network of lamel-lar phase of the system and as such are mechanically stabi-lized, hence their interaction and fusion are limited.S4 OP 166354Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 353 - 354 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsContinual rheology has shown that both samples ex-hibited \u201cshear-thinning\u201d (pseudoplastic) flow behavior with pronounced thixotropy. The obtained flow curves and calculated hysteresis area values showed that the addition of the 0.4% (w/w) of ARSC-liposomes has led to a slight increase in viscosity and thickening of the placebo cream, but rheological behavior of both creams stayed rather sim-ilar. Oscillation frequency sweep test has shown preva-lence of the elastic over the viscous component as the one of the general characteristics of lamellar phase (Lukic et al., 2013) for both samples. Active sample (F1a) had high-er elastic-storage modulus (G\u2019) and viscous-loss modulus (G\u2019\u2019) compared to the placebo (Fp) which is in accordance with the result of continual rheological measurements. In-crements in all the assessed rheological parameters upon the addition of ARSC-liposomes, could be due to lamellar phase promotion by the cosmetic active and the change in orientation of the lamellae under shear stress or due to the presence of intact liposomes themselves.Thermal behavior of the investigated samples (Fp, F1a) was similar in terms of the shape of the obtained pro-files with one marked peak. The addition of the liposome-encapsulated active (sample F1a) induces a subtle shift of the curve towards higher peak temperature values. Al-though such results may imply the promotion of the lamel-lar phase (Lukic et al., 2013), considering the polarization micrographs and the rheology results, it is more likely that the detected thermal behavior is due to ARSC-liposomes themselves.Regarding TGA results, upon the addition of the ac-tive, amounts of the lost water decreased in the first tem-perature range (25-50 \u00b0C, corresponds to the free water in the system) and increased in the third temperature range (70-110 \u00b0C, corresponds to interlamellar water) (Lukic et al., 2013). After the addition of ARSC-liposomes there was no change in the percentage of lost water in the sec-ond temperature range (50-70 \u00b0C, corresponds to the wa-ter bonded within the lipophilic gel phase). Based on all results, we assume that vesicles packed near the lamellar crystalline phase around the oil droplets and their inherent water-binding capacity jointly led to the observed transport of the water within the system. In order to assess the in vivo irritation potential of samples (Fp, F1a and Fc) and the investigated emulsifier, EI was monitored. Additionally, the potential skin barrier impairment was assessed via TEWL and EC. After the 24-hour occlusion, EI was not significantly changed compared to the baseline values for any tested cream. TEWL was sig-nificantly decreased for the creams Fp and F1a compared to the baseline. Considering that TEWL was not significantly changed for the commercial cream Fc (the same active, but different carrier), it could be speculated that these results can be attributed to the carrier itself (system with the liquid crystalline structure) and the used emulsifier. Assumption is in accordance with the reported results concerning skin mildness of this type of emulsifiers (Lukic et al., 2013). Regarding EC, it was significantly increased compared to the baseline values in all the treated sites, apart from the placebo sample Fp where merely a trend of increase was observed. Since there was no significant change in the EC for the untreated control under occlusion, the obtained re-sults cannot be attributed to the occlusion. The absence of erythema and/or any impairment of the skin barrier func-tion in a 24-h occlusion study may preliminarily imply a satisfying safety profile of the creams and the used APG emulsifier.ConclusionThe study confirmed that a novel alkyl polyglucoside emulsifier, hydroxystearyl alcohol & hydroxystearyl glu-coside, could be classified as liposome-friendly. It was shown that in the system stabilized with lamellar phas-es, liposomes are apparently immobilized within its net-work and as such are mechanically stabilized. Addition-ally, due to the lack of skin irritation and skin barrier im-pairment during the application on healthy skin, it could be said that the investigated emulsifier is skin-friendly and may be safely applied as stabilizer for cosmetic or prospec-tive pharmaceutical emulsion carrier for liposomes.ReferencesKulkarni, V.S., 2005.

Macedonia* dmtlsn@unife.itIntroductionSunscreen products are cosmetics according to Coun-cil Directive 76/768/EC (CD 76/768/EC, 1976). The ef-ficacy and moreover the safety of sunscreen products, as well as the basis upon which they are claimed are part of extensive research because of the importance over the general human health. For the regulation of the sunscreen products referral to the EC 1223/2009 of the European Par-liament (EC1223/2009, 2009) and to the Recommendation EC 2006/647 (2006) on the efficacy and claims of sun-screen products was done. Based on this legislation it is necessary to validate the photo protection separately in the range of UVA and UVB, with in vitro and in vivo methods, with preference for the latter. The UVA range (320 - 400 nm) in vivo tests have been replaced with the in vitro tests, because of the con-sideration of the good correlation found, harmonized and standardized in the ISO 24443 (2012). For the UVB range (290 - 320 nm) the use of the method in vivo is still a ne-cessity, standardized by Standard ISO 24444 (2010), due to problems related to lack of correlation between the in vitro and in vivo data. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) contin-ues to be widely used for describing the real performance of the product as well as its safety, and it is sometimes mis-understood, as the unique indicator for the efficacy and safety. Besides the numerical value of the SPF other prop-erties and factors have to be taken into account by the con-sumers. During the last decade the sunscreen formulations are enriched with many other ingredients such as boosters, antioxidants, immune-modulators. Also into many already marketed products for skin care and make up sunscreen fil-ters are added. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to describe perfor-mance as a whole formula protection factor: Formulation Efficiency Factor (FEF) calculated as SPF/actives % x 100 (O\u2019Lenick and Lott, 2011). FEF as a new parameter in the sunscreen research relates the amount of active sunscreens in a formulation to the overall SPF of the finished prod-uct. A formulation chemist can quickly and accurately ap-ply the method to access the efficiency of a certain formu-lation. Sunscreens can be classified into three major cate-gories based on the formulation active ingredients: organ-ic, inorganic/organic and inorganic. In this complex pat-tern and to properly address our work toward the develop-ment of safe and effective solar products, we investigated the factors that influence the in vitro SPF determination. Having increasing problems in the determination of in vi-tro SPF values predictive of the in vivo assessment. With this work, we intended to evaluate, at first repeatability of the measure and, secondly, the accuracy of the same. Test variables of the in vitro SPF determination, such as substrate surface temperature, substrate choice and pres-sure of sunscreen spreading have been examined (Miksa et al., 2013).The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the type of product, way of application and method used to determine in vitro SPF.S4 OP 167356Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 355 - 356 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsMaterials and methodsSun Protection Factor (SPF) measurement and in vivo correlationSPF in vitro assessment was carried out on 80 random commercially available products, beside the 3 standard products prepared by us as reference formulating SPF from low and medium to high. Two different protocols for in vitro determination were used: the Diffey-Robson method (method A) and the ISO-24443 (method B), using tape and PMMA plates respectively with two different pressured ap-plied (100 and 200 g) for spreadability. In vivo tests of se-lected products were also obtained for comparison using a solar simulator SPF Ultraviolet Solar Simulator 600-150 W/300 W Multiport that provides ultraviolet radiation in the region between 290 and 400 nm from 6 independent outputs. The results were collected on 10 volunteers male and female, belonging to the phototype I, II and III, aged between 20 and 35 years.Different PMMA\u2019s and surgical tape Transpore TM, quantity of product, spectrophotometers (JascoV530PC and Shimadzu UV-2600) and method of application (man-ual and mechanical) were examined. For the ISO-24443 (method B), the tested product was applied to a new PMMA plate of 5 cm x 5 cm area, and 5 \u00b5m of roughness (Schonberg GmbH). The application rate of 0.0128 g/cm2 \u00b1 0.0003 g was controlled by mass. The application dose was determined by measuring the plates before and after the spreading operation. The application of the product has been realized according to the ISO 24443 (2012) guidelines by spotting, with a pipette, the product on several points all over the plate surface and then distributed by a finger-tip, pre-conditioned with the testing sample, for 30 second, with light circular movements; the plate is then positioned on a scale where the spreading phase is carry out perform-ing a pattern of movements in horizontal in vertical direc-tion, checking the pressure applied in all the moments. For all the products the spreading pressure is first of 100 g and in a second analyze of 200 g. Before the measure the sam-ple lies for a minimum of 30 minutes in a dark place. The spectrophotometer used in this method is a Shimadzu UV 2600 provided of integrating sphere ISR 2600 60 mm, and coupled with a SPF determination software: for each sam-ple the transmittance is measured from 290 to 400 nm. Ev-ery product has been measured 3 times, i.e. three different product applications on three different plates. Each sample has been tested in six different areas at least; therefore the results presented come from an average of 15 set of data.Results and discussionThe in vivo test is only a recommendation (EC 2006/647, 2006) and in fact many companies, limited by the cost of the in vivo procedure, are often relying on sole-ly the results from the in vitro or even on simulations from calculating software, based on the concentration of filters used. In our investigation, the limited reliability of in vitro method was confirmed on complex formulation. The cal-culated SPF data indicate that the spreading method devel-oped in our laboratory is reproducible for all the product test e with Cov% values less than 5%. Most accurate re-sults were obtained with the B method that, in terms of in-ternal repeatability and of acceptance parameters, provid-ed some correspondence with values obtained in vivo, in particular using PMMA plates standardized as the rough-ness, pressure, amount of product and way of application. In conclusion, our method B gave statistically sound re-sults and the better correlation between the in vitro and in vivo data, these data although preliminary, encourages us to further extend the study to a larger number of samples in order to better understand if any affordable method can be drawn on the basis of these premises.ConclusionOur study indicates that the variability of response is largely related with the standardization and thus harmoni-zation of the procedure between different labs and thus we suggest joint cooperative efforts toward a possible ISO def-inition of an SPF-Vitro protocol.ReferencesCD 76/768/EC, 1976.

Antonijevi\u0107* Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Greenwich at Medway, Chatham Maritime, ME4 4TB, UK* M.Antonijevic@gre.ac.ukIntroductionEmollients are therapeutic moisturisers that are usual-ly available as leave-on formulations of various types i.e. creams, ointments, lotions and gels (Ersser et al., 2007). These products are used for the treatment of dry skin con-ditions such as eczema and psoriasis (Voegeli, 2011). Due to the wide range of products available on the market it can be difficult to recommend the most effective and appro-priate emollients for the patient. As such, prescribers tend to recommend leave-on topical emollient products based primarily on patient preference and cost (Moncrieff et al., 2013). However, to achieve maximum benefit the emol-lient product must be both clinically effective as well as cosmetically appealing (Dederen et al., 2013). It is also recognised that emollient preparations are not the same even if claimed to be equivalent to other products, hence prescribers are encouraged to avoid false economy in their prescribing practices (Moncrieff et al., 2013). It is there-fore critical for manufacturers to develop innovative prod-ucts with optimised clinical performance and appealing sensory characteristics (Herman, 2007). To achieve this, application of simple and cost-effective analytical meth-odologies/approaches that can screen and compare such characteristics would be advantageous (Inoue et al., 2013; Stojiljkovi\u0107 et al., 2013).Emollient gels are considered one of the most cosmet-ically acceptable leave-on topical formulations, because of their high water content and non-greasy feel (Ersser et al., 2007).  These emollient formulations are oil-in-water (O/W) dispersions emulsified using, in general, carbomer gelling agents. The gelling agent(s) act as a physical stabi-lizer of the dispersed oil droplets, preventing phase separa-tion. The effectiveness of these formulations when applied to the skin, however, relies on the ability of the gel ma-trix to deconstruct, enabling the separation of the oil phase from the aqueous phase. This has the impact of allowing the oils (emollients) to spread easily and form a uniform occlusive barrier over the skin surface, whilst prolonging emollient retention on the skin by rendering the oily ingre-dients resistant to re-emulsification (removal) upon subse-quent contact with water (Ersser et al., 2007). The break-down of the carbomer gel matrix is influenced by the shear applied, but driven by the interaction of the formulation with salts on the skin (Noveon, 2002). The interaction of the emollient gel formulations with salts is therefore an im-portant consideration when occlusive performance of the product is of concern. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the physical structure changes under the influence of salts and compare two marketed emollient gel products, namely Doublebase Gel (DBG) and Zerodouble Gel (ZDG) mar-keted in the UK.Materials and methodsVisual appearanceCommercial samples of DBG and ZDG were dis-pensed into a container measuring 13 mm diameter by 1 mm deep and leveled using a glass slide. The samples were then allowed to stand at room temperature for 48 hours to allow evaporation of water. Behaviour under the influence of saltsNearly 10% w/w salt (NaCl) to gel was prepared by sprinkling 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 g of NaCl onto 20 \u00b1 0.4 g of each for-mulation and gently mixed by folding the sample on itself ten times using a spatula. They were then left to stand for S4 PP 168358Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 357 - 358 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentations30 minutes. Untreated control samples for each formula-tion were folded in the same manner without added salt so-lution.MicroscopyApproximately 20 mg of each treated and control sam-ple was mixed with Nile Red fluorescent dye. The sam-ples were then placed on microscopic slides and pressed with cover slips for 5 seconds. After 1h, the samples were viewed under a Laser microscope (Nikon eclipse 90i) x 60 magnification. Results and discussionConsiderable differences were observed between the surface characteristics and consistencies of the two formu-lations prior to salt treatment.  DBG was found to have a smoother and a more homogeneous textural appearance when compared to ZDG. These differences were found to be even more evident on drying under ambient conditions. These differences in appearance could result from the man-ufacturing processes and the composition and quality of the ingredients used.Carbomers are sensitive to the presence of salts. The addition of small amounts of salt can be used to thicken the emulsion. The thickening of the polymer is brought about by repulsion of like charges on the polymer back-bone, causing the polymer to swell. Most carbomer grades have a tolerance limit of 0.1% salt (Noveon, 2002).  In the presence of a higher concentration of salt, this repulsion is reduced, resulting in the collapse of the extended polymer chain and reduced viscosity. This behaviour of the poly-mer, in the presence of salt, is important for the delivery of the emollients during the application of these skincare products i.e. the salts on the skin are expected to break down the polymer, making the formulation spread more easily while releasing the emollient.The behaviour of the two gel formulations after com-ing into contact with salt (NaCl) were found to be differ-ent. The DBG formulation seems to largely break down into a liquid (decreased viscosity). The ZDG formulation, on the other hand, does not break down and instead appears to curdle and become firmer (increased viscosity). This im-plies that the polymers used in the manufacturing of the products are not similar. Furthermore, this difference in be-haviour demonstrates why the DBG formulation might be expected to spread more easily when applied to the skin.Microscopic examination also revealed differences be-tween the emulsions, both as original untreated formula-tions and following salt exposure. For DBG, the structural network stabilizing the oil droplets breaks down complete-ly, releasing the oil droplets from the emulsion. In contrast, for ZDG, microscopic examination suggests that the emul-sion structure does not break down to the same extent and manner as DBG. ConclusionPresented work has shown that simple visual inspec-tion of the physical structures of two emollient gels be-fore and after interaction with salts can reveal important differences between two products that may have implica-tions for their effectiveness and patient acceptability. The two emollient gel formulations studied have quite different visual appearances and behave very differently in circum-stances mimicking contact with salts on the skin. In con-trast to ZDG, DBG is a homogeneous gel that completely breaks down in the presence of salts, releasing the oil drop-lets from the emulsion. This has very important implica-tions in relation to clinical performance and patient pref-erence, where the ease with which the oily ingredients can be spread, irreversibly delivering a uniform and occlusive barrier over the skin, are crucial. These results therefore point to qualitative differences between the formulations and very likely reflect important differences between their respective manufacturing methods and ingredients.

Antonijevi\u0107* Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, ME4 4TB, UK* M.Antonijevic@gre.ac.ukIntroductionTopical leave-on emollient gel formulations are one of the most cosmetically acceptable therapeutic moisturisers, because of their non-greasy feel (Ersser et al., 2007). These oil-in-water (O/W) dispersions use carbomer as both the gelling and emulsifying agent. Whilst the carbomer acts to physically stabilise the dispersed oil droplets and thus pre-vent phase separation, its ability to deconstruct once ap-plied to the skin is an important indicator of the effective-ness of these formulations. Deconstruction/breakdown of the gel matrix, due to contact with salts in the skin, results in phase separation of the oil from the aqueous phase, al-lowing the emollients (oils) to spread easily and form a uniform occlusive barrier over the skin surface. This also has the impact of prolonging the emollient retention on the skin by rendering the oily ingredients resistant to re-emul-sification (Ersser et al., 2007). When applied, the ability of the gel formulation to spread easily and leave a uniform occlusive layer of emol-lients on the skin is reliant on the textural properties i.e. firmness/stiffness of the gel matrix. These textural prop-erties also have an important impact on the cosmetic ac-ceptability of the formulation, such as the stickiness of the gel, which may influence the patient\u2019s willingness to gen-erously apply the product, and therefore obtain the maxi-mum benefits. Interaction with salts causes the carbomer gel matrix to break down and it is therefore expected to have an impor-tant influence on the textural properties (Noveon, 2002). Characterizing the textural properties before and after in-teraction with salts could be an important indicator for the performance of the product during application. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the textural properties of two marketed emollient gel prod-ucts, namely Doublebase Gel (DBG) and Zerodouble Gel (ZDG) marketed in the UK, before and after interaction with salt (NaCl).Materials and methodsFirmness/stiffness and Stickiness by Texture Analysis (TA)50 g of commercial samples of DBG and ZDG were weighed into a beaker and subjected to compression using 35 mm diameter cylindrical probe (Stable Microsystems TA-HD plus) to measure firmness/stiffness and stickiness.The force was measured as the probe compressed the sample by 15 mm distance after an initial trigger force (0.5 N) at a rate of 0.5 mm/sec.When 15 mm target distance was reached the probe moved back to its starting position at 10 mm/sec recording the force required to separate the probe from the sample. This force is an indicator of stickiness. Samples were ana-lysed in triplicates.Spreadability by TA1.1 \u00b1 0.1 g of samples were compressed between two glass plates using predetermined forces, namely 1, 5, 20, 40 and 50 N. At each force the area of spread was marked out and calculated.Different samples were used for the measurements of speadability at each force applied.Behaviour under the influence of saltsNearly 10% w/w salt (NaCl) to the gel were prepared by sprinkling 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 g of NaCl onto 20 \u00b1 0.4 g of each formulation and gently mixed by folding the sample on it-S4 PP 169360Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 359 - 360 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsself ten times using a spatula. Firmness/stiffness, stickiness and spreadability of these samples were determined in the same manner as pre-treated samples.Results and discussionFirmness and stickiness of moisturisers are impor-tant sensory characteristics for consumers (Herman, 2007). Furthermore, firmness of the formulations contributes to the ability of the material to spread. These properties of the products were investigated using texture analysis, which allows for the determination of the force required to com-press the formulation (a measure of firmness) and the force required to separate the probe from the sample (a measure of stickiness).Considerable differences were observed between the two untreated formulations in terms of firmness and stick-iness. ZDG appears to form a significantly firmer (3.6 \u00b1 0.1 N) and more sticky (3.7 \u00b1 0.2 N) polymeric structure in comparison to DBG formulation (2.6 and 2.5 N for firm-ness and stickiness respectively). Upon treatment with salts, the DBG polymeric struc-ture readily breaks down, resulting in extensive loss of firmness. In contrast, significant firmness of the ZDG structure was maintained after exposure to salts. The stick-iness of the products could not be differentiated after salt treatment.Important differences in spreadability were observed between the two emollient gels under applied force. The DBG formulation spread more easily than ZDG. For ex-ample at 20 N of applied force, the untreated DBG formu-lation spread over an area of 24.6 \u00b1 0.1 mm2, whereas the ZDG formulation spread over an area of 16.2 \u00b1 0.1 mm2. The capability of DBG to spread was greatly increased when exposed to salts and demonstrates a 27 % increase in area of spread. Interestingly, no such effect was observed for ZDG as no substantial difference was observed be-tween the ZDG samples prior to and after being exposed to salts (15.4 mm2 area of spread obtained).ConclusionThe presented work shows that these two emulsified gel formulations have different textural characteristics, with DBG being a less firm and less sticky gel that spreads more easily in comparison to ZDG. These two gels also be-have very differently in circumstances mimicking contact with salts on the skin.  In contrast to ZDG, the DBG poly-meric structure readily breaks down when exposed to salts, resulting in extensive loss of firmness and increased ability to spread. The study data highlights important qualitative differences between emollient gel products, which may have resulted from differences in their respective manufac-turing methods and ingredients. This may in turn, have im-portant implications for clinical performance and patient preference. Furthermore, this type of study points out the need for more comprehensive analysis of products as pa-tient and prescriber perceptions may lead them to select products that sometimes may not be as beneficial as they believe. Development of new methodologies for the as-sessment of emollient gel products is therefore necessary to fully assess the potential performance of such products.

Previous studies have shown that infections after cesarean section could be decreased using preop-eratively an antimicrobial agent (Chelmow et al., 2001). However in order to achieve therapeutic concentrations in both maternal and fetal serum and amniotic fluid, antibiot-ic have to pass placental barrier. It is proven that a single dose of intravenously administered antibiotic is as effec-tive as multiple doses given perioperatively (Lamont et al., 2011). Accordingly, single doses of cefuroxime have been widely used for antimicrobial prophylaxis during cesare-an delivery. Previous studies have shown that cefuroxime concentrations in amniotic fluid and in umbilical cord plas-ma are sufficient to combat most microorganisms. Howev-er, diseases such are hypertension and diabetes could alter placental transferto the extent that the prophylactic effect is lacking in both the mother and fetus. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of diabetes and hy-pertension on the transplacental permeation of cefuroxime.Materials and methodsFifty-three women scheduled for cesarean section were divided into three groups: healthy women (n = 18), wom-en with arterial hypertension (n = 21), and women with gestational diabetes (n = 14). All women received 1.5 g, intravenously cefuroxime. Study was conducted in accor-dance with international ethical guidelines (CIOMS) and the study protocol was approved by Ethics Committee of the Gynecology and Obstetric Clinic of Clinical Centre of Vojvodina (no. 100-08/9). Informed consent was obtained from each woman before enrolment in the study. The study was designed as an open-label study. Each intravenous in-jection of cefuroxime was completed in less than 1 min. Sampling points were chosen in order not to disturb reg-ular cesarean section procedures in the clinic. Blood sam-ples were collected from mothers after administration of cefuroxime before delivery (t1), at the time of delivery (t2), and after delivery (t3). At delivery, umbilical venous and arterial samples were obtained from a section of umbili-cal cord (cross-clamped at delivery). Estimated gestation-al age at birth, weight, length and 1and 5 min Apgar scores were recorded. Concentration of cefuroxime was measured using a modification of an HPLC method described previ-ously (Szlagowska et al., 2010). Pharmacokinetic parame-ters were calculated for each woman using plasma cefurox-ime concentration data with WinNonLin version 4.1 (SCI software, Pharsight Corporation, Gary, NC, USA). The ef-fects of diabetes and hypertension on cefuroxime placen-tal-permeation were assessed by the fetomaternal plasma concentration ratios (Cv/Cm) and umbilical cord venous blood (Ca/Cv). Results were compared using ANOVA test (p\u02c20.05).Results and discussionNeonates born to women in the hypertensive group had significantly lower body surface area (BSA), weight, 5-min Apgar score, and gestational age than neonates born to women in the control group. Neonate characteristics in the diabetic group did not differ significantly compared with either the hypertensive or control groups.S4 PP 170362Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 361 - 362 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsTthe Ca/Cv ratio in all three groups was near 1, with no significant differences among the control, hypertensive, and diabetic groups (1.01\u00b10.16, 1.06\u00b10.23, and 0.95\u00b10.34, respectively). This correlates with the physicochemical characteristics of cefuroxime, which is a very hydrophil-ic weak acid (Log Poctanol/water 0.4) and is almost com-pletely dissociated at blood pH (7.4) (Holt et al., 1993). Thus, the slightly acidic pH of neonatal compared with ma-ternal blood would not lead to the accumulation of cefurox-ime in neonates. In the present study, neither hypertension nor diabetes had any significant effect on cefuroxime accu-mulation in neonates. The Cv/Cm ratios were significantly lower in the diabetic compared with the control and hyper-tensive groups (0.36\u00b10.13 vs 0.71\u00b10.46 and 0.59\u00b10.40, re-spectively). However, there were no significant differenc-es between the control and hypertension group and because gestational age was significantly lower in the hypertensive than control group, the findings confirms those of a pre-vious study that reported that gestational age had no ef-fect on cefuroxime crossing the placental barrier (Holt et al., 1993). Pharmacokinetic parameters, such as drug plas-ma concentrations at zero time (C0), mean resident time (MRT0\u2013t3) and areas under the time-concentration curves to infinity (AUCinf) were not significantly different among the three groups. The elimination half-life (t\u00bd) was signifi-cantly shorter in the hypertensive than control and diabetic groups because the constant of elimination (\u03bbz) was higher in the former group compared with the latter groups. Ap-parent volume of distribution and clearance were signifi-cantly lower in the diabetic group compared with the con-trol and hypertensive groups. Lower transplacental transfer in the diabetic group compared with the hypertensive and control groups could be also due to lower volume of distri-bution and clearance.ConclusionHypertension had no significant effect on the perme-ation of cefuroxime nor on its pharmacokinetics. Diabetes led to decreased placental transfer of cefuroxime, as well as volume of distribution and clearance, but did not affect other pharmacokinetic parameters. Prophylactic concen-trations of cefuroxime were reached in all groups, but the dosing time of cefuroxime should not be less than 30 min or greater than 2 h prior to delivery.AcknowledgmentThis work was supported by the Ministry of Educa-tion, Science and Technological Development of Serbia (III41012).ReferencesChelmow, D., Ruehli, M.S., Huang, E., 2001.

Diazepam is lipophilic drug that is weak base and it is used in the treatment of maternal eclampsia and as a premedication in cesarean section de-liveries. Diazepam readily crosses the blood\u2013brain barri-er and the placenta by passive diffusion. It is also excreted into breast milk and studies showed that diazepam reaches equilibrium in the feto-maternal systemic circulation 10-15 minutes after intravenous administration (Bakke et al., 1992). Also, some diseases such as diabetes and hyperten-sion have been associated to impaired placental composi-tion and functions. Previous studies carried out in our lab-oratories have demonstrated impaired drug permeation in diabetic animals. The development and progression of di-abetes have been associated with disturbed drug absorp-tion due to dysfunctional protein expression and function-ality, impaired transcellular transport and intercellular traf-ficking as well as altered gut physiology (Al-Salami et al., 2009). The aim of this study was to investigate the influ-ence of diabetes and hypertension on the placental perme-ation of diazepam.Materials and methodsPregnant women were recruited from the Gynecology and Obstetric Clinic in Vojvodina, Serbia. Pregnant wom-en scheduled for cesarean section, those who were diag-nosed with gestational or arterial hypertension as well as those who were diagnosed gestational diabetes were in-cluded in this study. The study protocol was approved by Ethic Committee of the Gynecology and Obstetistric clinic in Vojvodina (N\u00b000-08/9) and informed consents were ob-tained from each participant before inclusion in the study. A total 75 pregnant women were divided into three groups: group 1 (healthy control, n=31), group 2 (diabetic, n=14) and group 3 (hypertensive, n=30). Two sets of diazepam plasma samples were collected and measured (after the ad-ministration single dose of 5 mg/day intramuscularly), be-fore (t1), during (t2) and after delivery (t3). The first set of blood samples was taken from the mother (maternal ve-nous). The second set of samples was taken from the fetus (fetal umbilical veins and arteries). Diazepam concentra-tions in plasma were measured by modified HPLC meth-od previously described (Rouini et al., 2008). Pharmacoki-netic parameters were calculated using non compartmen-tal analyses using with WinNonLin version 4.1 (SCI soft-ware, Pharsight Corporation, Gary, NC, USA). Values of AUCs after delivery were taken as a measure of diazepam elimination from blood. In order to assess the effect of dia-betes and hypertension on diazepam placental-permeation, the ratios of fetal to maternal blood concentrations were determined. Also umbilical cord arterial to umbilical cord venous concentration ratio was determined as a measure of diazepam uptake, distribution and/or metabolism in neo-nates. Data were analyzed by ANOVA test and differences were considered statistically significant if p\u22640.05.Results and discussionAll neonates were similar in length, weight and body surface area values. Also, there were no statistically signif-icant differences neither in height, weight nor body surface S4 PP 171364Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 363 - 364 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsarea of the women between three investigated groups. The diabetic and hypertensive groups have 2-fold increase in the fetal umbilical-venous concentrations, compared to the maternal venous concentrations. Feto: maternal plasma-concentrations ratios were higher in diabetic (2.01\u00b11.01) and hypertensive (2.26\u00b11.23) groups compared with con-trol (1.30\u00b10.48) while, there was no difference in ratios between the diabetic and hypertensive groups. Umbili-cal-cord arterial: venous ratios (within each group) were similar among all groups (control: 0.97\u00b10.32; hyperten-sive: 1.08\u00b10.60 and diabetics1.02\u00b10.77) and there were no statistically significant differences. There were statistical-ly significant higher AUCs values before delivery in con-trol and hypertension group compared to diabetes group. Meaning that transfer of diazepam in diabetic group was higher even though exposure was lower probably due to increased permeability of placenta in diabetic women. Val-ues of AUCs after delivery were statistically higher in con-trol group compared to hypertension and diabetes group, but there were no statistical differences between hyperten-sion and diabetes group. These results implies that elimina-tion of diazepam from central compartment is higher in hy-pertension and diabetes group and that is likely that there were more unbound diazepam in the blood in these groups, since total clearance of diazepam is directly proportional to free diazepam fraction (Riss et al., 2008).ConclusionOn line with our previous findings which demonstrate disturbed transcellular trafficking of lipophilic drugs in di-abetes, this study shows significant increase in diazepam placental-permeation in diabetic and hypertensive preg-nant women suggesting poor transcellular control of drug permeation and flux, and bigger exposure of the fetus to drug-placental transport.AcknowledgmentThis work was supported by the Ministry of Educa-tion, Science and Technological Development of Serbia (III 41012).ReferencesBakke, O.M., Haram, K., 1982.

One of the strategies to improve its dissolution rate includes development of self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS). SMEDDS are isotropic mixtures of oil, surfactant, cosurfactant, and a drug, that under dilution in vivo can spontaneously form microemulsions with droplet size less than 50 nm (Gursoy and Benita, 2004; Hauss, 2007). The aim of this study was to formulate and characterize self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems of simvastatin with increased dissolution rate of simvastatin.Materials and methodsMaterialsSimvastatin (Ph. Eur. grade) was obtained from Hemofarm a.d. (Serbia). Caprylocaproyl macrogol-8 glycerides (Labrasol\u00ae), propylene glycol monocaprylate (Capryol\u2122 PGMC) and oleoyl macrogol-6 glycerides (Labrafil\u00ae M1944CS) were obtained from Gattefoss\u00e9 (France). Polysorbate 80 was obtained from Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Germany). MethodsFormulation and preparation of SMEDDSSurfactant phase of Labrasol\u00ae as surfactant and Poly-sorbate 80 as cosurfactant were mixed at fixed weight ratio 3:1. Oil (Capryol\u2122 PGMC or Labrafil\u00ae M1944CS) was then added to surfactant phase at varios ratios (from 9:1 to 1:9) and mixed on magnetic stirrer. After preparation, all samples were titrated with highly purified water drop by drop. Two single-phase, transparent systems are consid-ered to be microemulsions and selected for further inves-tigations. Both samples contained 67.5% Labrasol, 22.5% Polisorbat 80 and 10% oil (Capryol\u2122 PGMC-sample F1 or Labrafil\u00ae M1944CS-sample F2). Simvastatin (5% w/w) was dissolved in these selected SMEDDS by constant mix-ing on magnetic stirrer at 50-60 \u00b0C until a clear solution was obtained (samples F1s and F2s).SMEDDS characterizationDroplet size determinationBoth, unloaded and simvastatin-loaded SMEDDS were diluted with highly purified water (1:10). The aver-age droplet size (Z-ave) and polydispersity index (PDI) of unloaded and simvastatin-loaded systems were determined immediately after dilution by photon correlation spectros-copy (NanoZS90, Malvern Instruments, UK) at wave-length of 633 nm and a scattering angle of 90 \u00b0. The results were the mean and standard deviation (S.D.) of three con-secutive measurements for each sample.In vitro dissolution studiesFor in vitro dissolution studies liquid SMEDDS with 20 mg of simvastatin were filled into hard gelatin capsules (size 0), and compared to commercially available tablet containing the same dose of simvastatin. The dissolution test was carried out using rotating pad-dle apparatus (Erweka DT70, Germany). The dissolution medium consisted of phosphate buffer pH 7.0, the volume S4 PP 172366Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 365 - 366 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationswas 900 ml, and the temperature of the dissolution medi-um was maintained at 37 \u00b0C with a rotating speed of 75 rpm. At fixed time intervals (5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and, 60 min), 10 ml samples were withdrawn from the dissolution medi-um and replaced by 10 ml of fresh phosphate buffer. Sink conditions were maintained at all times. All samples were filtered using membrane filter (0.45 \u03bcm MF-Millipore\u00ae membrane filter, Millipore Corporation, USA) and simvas-tatin concentration was determined spectrophotometrical-ly at 239 nm (Evolution 300, Termo Fisher Scientific, Eng-land). The dissolution experiments were carried out in trip-licate, and data were expressed as mean value \u00b1 S.D.Results and discussionDroplet size analysisThe average droplet size (nm) of samples F1, F1s, F2 and F2s were 18.58\u00b10.04, 46.41\u00b10.17, 11.68\u00b10.12 and 17.45\u00b10.04, respectively. It could be concluded that upon high water dilution both unloaded and drug-loaded SMEDDS are capable to form microemulsions, because the average droplet size is less than 50 nm (Gursoy and Benita, 2004; Hauss, 2007). Slightly higher droplet size of F1s, compared to unloaded F1, might be due to the inter-ference of the drug with self-emulsification process (Gur-soy and Benita, 2004).Polydispersity index represents the uniformity of droplet size within the formulation and for selected sam-ples F1, F1s, F2 and F2s were 0.155\u00b10.005, 0.286\u00b10.001, 0.137\u00b10.016 and 0.168\u00b10.005, respectively. Lower value of PDI in sample F2s indicated better uniformity of drop-let size, in comparison to formulation F1s. Both unloaded and SIM-loaded SMEDDS have shown monomodal drop-let size distribution.In vitro dissolution studyComparative in vitro dissolution profiles of simvastatin from SMEDDS filled in hard gelatin capsules and commercial (immediate release) tablet showed that simvastatin was completely released from both SMEDDS within first 5 minutes. The release rate of simvastatin from SMEDDS was significantly faster compared with commercially available tablet (approximately 14.57% after 1 hour), which might be due to the surfactants present in formulations.  Karim et al. (2015) showed that the droplet size of the microemulsion could determine the rate and extent of simvastatin release, since the in vitro drug release was faster from formulations with smaller droplet size. However, in this study there was no significant difference in simvastatin release between two selected SMEDDS.ConclusionSelf-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) containing simvastatin were formulated and evaluated. Upon appropriate water dilution SMEDDS formed microemulsions with droplet size less than 50 nm. Although F2s had smaller droplet size and narrower drop-let size distribution, in vitro dissolution study revealed that simvastatin was completely released from both SMEDDS (F1s and F2s) in 5 minutes. These results indicated that de-velopment of SMEDDS could effectively enhance in vi-tro dissolution rate of simvastatin compared to commercial tablet and can be used as possible alternative.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the project TR34007 (Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Devel-opment, RS).ReferencesGursoy, R.N., Benita, S., 2004.

Macedonia* ngeskovski@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionIn the last decades, the struggle for efficient targeted drug therapy and diagnostics paved the road to clinical use of nanomedicines. However, the research and understand-ing of the interactions among the engineered nanomateri-als and the biological environment, to date, presents quite a challenge. It is becoming clear that, when placed into a biological environment, nanoparticles initiate a cascade of interactions with the biomacromolecules resulting in the formation of the \u2018protein corona\u2019 (a layer(s) of proteins adsorbed on the nanoparticles surface) (Monopoli et al., 2011). These interactions can alter the secondary structure of the adsorbed proteins promoting instability and/or expo-sure of new epitopes at the protein surface, thus giving rise to unexpected biological responses (Calzolai et al., 2010). Undoubtedly, the protein corona modifies the nanoparticles interface and thus affects their biological fate and overall performance. Therefore the characterization of the interac-tions at the nano-bio interface will greatly influence the un-derstanding and capability for prediction of the nanoparti-cles in vivo behavior. The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of the surface properties of different polymer-ic nanoparticles upon their interaction with a model pro-tein (bovine serum albumin - BSA) in a binary nanoparti-cle \u2013 BSA system.Materials and methodsMaterialsPLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw 148KDa and Mw 22KDa) was purchased from Akina Inc (USA). Lutrol F127 - Poly(ethylenoxide)-block-poly(propyleneoxide)-block-poly(ethyleneoxide) was kindly donated by BASF (Germa-ny) and BSA was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA). Bradford Protein assay dye reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad (USA). All other reagents and chemicals used were of analytical grade.MethodsNanoparticles preparation procedureNanoparticle formulations were prepared from PLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw 70,000:8,000:70,000Da) \u2013 NP1 and PLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw 6,000:10,000:6,000Da) \u2013 NP2, using the nanoprecipitation method, as described previous-ly (Dimchevska et al., 2015).Quantification of bovine serum albumin adsorptionAll samples were diluted to concentration of 2mg/ml and subsequently 1ml from each formulation was mixed with 1ml of 2mg/mL BSA solution in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The NP dispersions with BSA were incubated for 1h at 37\u00b0C in a water bath with horizontal shaking at 100 min-1. After the incubation, the samples were concentrated to 1mL using ultrafiltration tubes with pore size of 1000 kDa, and washed with phosphate buffer pH 7.4. Blank (BSA free) and control sample (without nanoparticles) were also used in the experiment. The amount of adsorbed BSA was indirectly quantified using the Bradford protein assay. Spectroscopic characterization of nanoparticle-bovine se-rum albumin interactionsThe samples were prepared as described above with additional freeze drying cycle (-40 \u00b0C, 0.055 mBar, FreeZ-S4 PP 173368Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 367 - 368 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsone 2.5 L, Labconco, USA) in order to remove the water. FTIR spectra of the samples were carried out using FT-IR spectrometer (660, Varian, USA). To calculate the rel-ative proportions of the different secondary structures of albumin, the spectral region of the Amide I (1700-1600 cm-1) was analyzed with appropriate software for spec-tral analysis (Grams32, Thermo, USA). Using Gauss-Lo-rentz transformation, six distinctive peaks of the second-ary protein structures were analyzed (\u03b2-sheets in spectral regions 1696-1690 cm-1, 1642-1624 cm-1 and 1618-1613 cm-1; \u03b2-turns in the spectral region 1685-1675 cm-1; \u03b1-helix in the region 1658-1654 cm-1; random coils in the region 1648-1640 cm-1). To avoid any influence of the vibration of the polymer chains in the region of Amide I, the spectra of empty nanoparticles were previously subtracted from the spectra of the samples with adsorbed albumin.Results and DiscussionThe results from the quantitative BSA adsorption stud-ies revealed that 24.6\u00b11.9 and 13.1\u00b10.9% of BSA were ad-sorbed on the surface of NP1 and NP2, respectively. The FTIR spectra of freeze dried BSA revealed broad band at 3287 cm-1 that originates from N-H bending vibra-tions (Amide A). The C-H bending of aliphatic chains can be noted on 2960 cm-1, 2933 cm-1 and 2875 cm-1. Strong C-O stretching vibration (Amide I) that originates from the am-ide bond in the peptide chain appears at 1645 cm-1 while the Amide II band (mainly N-H bending vibrations) is on 1516 cm-1. Several bands that represent mainly combinations of C-N stretching and N-H bending can be noticed in the region from 1400 cm-1 to 1200 cm-1. Distinctive blue shift of Am-ide I (1654 cm-1) in the spectra of NP1-BSA complex can be noticed, relative to the FTIR spectrum of BSA. Such shift of Amide I could be attributed to possible secondary structure changes of BSA that are initiated as a result of the interaction with the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, significant de-crease in the C-O antisymmetrical stretching vibrations from the PLGA blocks was noticed, indicating to possible growth of hydrophobicity in the microenvironment of surface ex-posed carbonyl groups. The FTIR spectrum of NP2-BSA complex reveals blue shift of Amide I and II relative to the bands on BSA spectrum. Additionally, there is a slight de-crease of the intensity of the carbonyl C-O vibrations band at 1756cm-1 and a red shift of the antisymmetrical C-O stretch-ing vibrations on the PEO chains (1087 and 955cm-1) relative to the respective bands in the spectrum of NP2. The curve fit-ting on Amide I in the previously mentioned FTIR spectra revealed that the secondary structure of the BSA molecule contains 35% \u03b1-helix, 32.5% \u03b2-sheets, 12% \u03b2-turns (short 4 amino acid segments that form antiparallel loops) and 20% of random coils. Having in mind that the spectrum was tak-en from freeze-dried sample of BSA, one can assume that the portion of \u03b1-helix will be reduced on the expense of the in-crease of \u03b2-sheets and random coils in the secondary struc-ture. The NP1-BSA and NP2-BSA demonstrated presence of 77.63% and 34.39% of \u03b1-helix, 11.51% and 31.76% of \u03b2-sheets, 10.8% and 17.74% of \u03b2-turns, 0.05% and 16.11% of random coils in the BSA molecule, respectively. Considering the above results one can assume that the behavior of BSA towards NP1 and NP2 is different, main-ly because of the differences in the density and PEO chain length of the nanoparticle hydrophilic corona. The PLGA/PEO ratio in NP1 and NP2 is 17.5:1 and 1.2:1, respectively. Having this in mind, it can be presumed that the PEO chain length and surface density can affect the accessibility of the hydrophobic nanoparticle core towards nonspecific interac-tions with BSA. The hydrophilic corona of NP2 is larger and more rigid and as such will be an effective steric barrier in the interaction of BSA with the hydrophobic PLGA core. The loss of \u03b1-helix in the secondary structure of BSA in the native BSA sample and NP2-BSA complex can be attributed to the freeze-drying stress of the BSA molecule that initiates hydrogen bonding redistribution in the secondary structure of the protein. The partially adsorbed BSA molecule won\u2019t be able to protect its intramolecular hydrogen bonds during the freeze drying process that will initiate the conversion of \u03b1-helix to random coils and \u03b2-sheets. On the other hand, the structure of the BSA that is adsorbed on the NP1 sur-face could be associated with its\u2019 native structure. The pres-ervation of the native structure during freeze drying is an-other indication of the hydrophobic nature of the NP1-BSA interactions resulting in significant contribution towards the maintenance of the BSA original hydrogen bonds.ConclusionThe results unambiguously point to the effect of the hydrophilic outer nanoparticle layer as a steric barrier for nanoparticle-BSA interactions. The formulations with low hydrophilic coverage expose the hydrophobic core and en-able strong hydrophobic binding with the proteins pres-ent in the corona. Such strong binding could result in ap-pearance of different new protein epitopes on the nano-bio interface and significantly alter the biological fate of the nanoparticles.ReferencesCalzolai, L., Franchini, F., Gilliland, D., Rossi, F., 2010.

Concerning to this, it is worth to mention here the experimentally confirmed effects, such as increased skin hydration after introducing in the diet linum usitatissimum oil (De Spirt et al., 2009). The linoleic and alpha-linolenic essential fatty acids are in-volved in restoring the cutaneous barrier, important in skin ceramides synthesis. Other authors have noted the favor-able effect of the linum usitatissimum oil on wound heal-ing, on an animal model (De Souza Franco et al., 2012). There are also experimental evidences regarding the ben-efits on skin excoriations. Additionally, the anti-inflamma-tory and even antibacterial effect leads some authors to cite flax oil as showing a positive effect on treating ringworm.On the other hand, theoretically, under the effect of lignans, (secoisolariciresinol diglucoside - SDG - the most abundant flax lignan) with estrogen-mimetic action, the oil of this species should have effects similar to other phytoes-trogens. This is the premise of our experimental study. The study aims to: (1) evaluate fatty acids in Linum usitatissimum oil, in order to be, at least, protective and nu-tritive for human skin, in topical application, (2) evidenc-ing the sebum-reducing capacity of linum oil, (3) observa-tion of a possible improvement of skin texture (a result of skin hydration), for the cases of seborrhea sicca (dry seb-orrhea).Materials and methodsLinseed oil was obtained from the seeds of the Alexin cultivar grown in the Didactic Station Timisoara of Banat\u2019s University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Med-icine Timisoara in 2014. The cutaneous study benefited from the enrollment for testing of 24 healthy female volun-teers, aged between 18 and 46, having oily and seborrhe-ic skin and the sebaceous glands were measured in terms of numbers and dimensions, by using the apparatus Pro-derm Analyser (NU SKIN, Provo, UT, USA). The evalua-tion of the cutaneous evolution was performed in the Der-matopharmacy and Cosmetology laboratory (University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timisoara). The criteria for in-cluding the volunteers in the study were: (1) Written con-sent of the volunteers after they understood the test proce-dure, (2) Diagnostic of seborrhea or normal oily skin, based on clinical criteria, (3) Lack of any pathological complica-tions (eg. acne, seborrheic scaling dermatitis) situations in which the oil is potentially harmful (obstructive, comedo-genic, or irritating) (4) Elimination of intolerance, after a preliminary test of the oil at a topical skin application. The assessments with Proderm Analyzer were recorded after 7 days of therapy, at the times: 7, 14, 21 and 28 days respec-tively. For each volunteer, at each time point, were counted the colored points per skin field explored (number of over-sized sebaceous glands per cm2) and the average was cal-culated for each time unit, separately for seboreea oleossa and for seboreea sicca.   S4 PP 174370Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 369 - 370 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsResults and discussionLinseed oil is characterized by a high content of linole-ic acid (0.313 mg / ml) and linolenic acid (0.214 mg / ml). The results are consistent with literature data mentioning a high concentration of linoleic acid in oil from linseed seeds cultivated in Romania but also in other countries. The daily use of linseed oil also produced an improvement in the ap-pearance of the skin, reducing the appearance of scaly skin to complete fade-out. There are no obvious differences be-tween the evolution of the seborrhea oleossa and the sicca during the test for the linum oil treated group, meaning that this oil has efficiency in both types of disorders.The most significant decrease of sebaceous glands number was registrered starting with the 14th day after the first treatment. The 14 days also represent the turnover of the sebocyte. In other words, after two weeks there are oth-er new sebocytes holding secretory activity under another hormonal stimulation, modified in the meantime. As a mat-ter of fact, the sebocyte is a cell with a prompt response to other pharmaceutical treatments as well, for example af-ter the treatment with topical retinoids the sebaceous se-cretion decreases dramatically, sometimes after only 7-10 days. The problem with retinoids, however, is their adver-sity to the epidermis, dryness and the erythema generated. ConclusionIn conclusion, linseed oil is one of the oldest natural remedies for skin nutrition. Recent studies show its ben-efits in scarring, in surgical wound healing optimization, in skin hydration and also in the domain of cutaneous ag-ing prevention.This study brings again linum usitatissimum oil in the foreground, this time for its sebum-reducing effect. This property is a confirmation of the hypothesis launched by the Lucas Meyer dermocosmetic laboratories, a property attributed to the lignans in flax seeds, known for their es-trogen-mimetic and implicitly anti-androgenic attributes, which means exactly an intervention on the hormonal mechanism of seborrhea. Our study opens a new prospect to lignans determinations, in different sort of linseeds, for a natural alternative in sebum-regulation field.   ReferencesDe Souza Franco, E., De Aquino, C. M.

Antioxidants, especially the ones naturally derived from plants, have been recognized as excellent source of bioactive compo-nents with beneficial effects on skin, especially to prevent premature skin aging and wrinkling. There is an increasing research interest in polyphenolic compounds which have proven to possess antioxidant activity, and have shown promising effects applied as cosmetic active ingredients (Braunlich et al., 2013).Materials and methodsTherefore, our group developed an anti-age cosmet-ic line consisting of day (D) and night (N) cream, both based on natural materials. Namely, in the stated creams (D and N) black chokeberry and hibiscus propylene gly-col extracts (produced at Institute for Medicinal Plant Re-search) and hyaluronic acid (low weight, Amedeo Brasca, Italy), were incorporated as active ingredients in the appro-priate hydrophilic (D-V, yielding cream D) and hydropho-bic (N-V, yielding cream N) vehicles, in which synthet-ic excipients were replaced with the ones of natural ori-gin. Chokeberry is one of the richest sources of natural an-tioxidants among fruits and vegetables, because of its bio-active components such as anthocyanins, flavonols, procy-anidins, and phenolic acids (Kulling and Rawel, 2008; Ru-gina et al., 2012; Sueiro et al., 2006). Beside chokebery ex-tract, D and N creams contained hibiscus extract, abundant in vitamin C that stimulates synthesis of collagen, a pro-tein responsible for skin tone and elasticity (Aburjai and Natsheh, 2003). Hyaluronic acid, natural component of the skin located in the extracellular matrix, recovers lost skin moisture and gives the visual effect of skin lifting (Scott and Banga, 2015). Avocado oil, grape seed oil and shea butter (all from Comcen, Serbia) included in both creams, effectively feed and revitalize the skin due to the complex of active ingredients they contain, especially high content of fatty acids. Creams contain components of natural wet-ting factors of skin (complex of hexylene glycol, fructose, glucose, sucrose, urea, dextrin, alanine, glutamic acid, as-partic acid, hexyl nicotinate) and elastin (both from Che-misches Laboratorium Dr Kurt Richter GmbH, Germany). Elastin as a protein, is responsible for skin tone, gives it back skin moisturize, elasticity and freshness. Both creams contain a complex of UV filters (ethyl hexyl methoxy-cinnamate, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, ethyl hexyl salycilate, Coning PPI, Serbia) that protect the skin from harmful sun rays.Safety profile/irritation potential of the developed cos-metic products (active creams-D and N, as well as their matching vehicles-D-V and N-V, respectively), was eval-uated using noninvasive measurements of the appropriate biophysical parameters of the skin in a 24-h in vivo study under occlusion.Thirty one healthy female volunteers (mean age 46.09), which participated in the study, were thoroughly informed about the possible treatment effects and the pro-tocol of the examination prior to signing written consents, in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute for Medicinal Plant Research \u201cDr. Josif Pan\u010di\u0107\u201d, Belgrade, Serbia (Decision No 01-9337-13). The following param-S4 PP 175372Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 371 - 372 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationseters were evaluated: electrical capacitance (EC) (quanti-fying the stratum corneum hydration), transepidermal wa-ter loss (TEWL), as a measure of skin barrier function and erythema index (EI), as a measure of skin colour, using Multi Probe Adapter MPA\u00ae9 (Courage & Khazaka Elec-tronic GmbH, Germany). All measurements were conduct-ed on flexor aspects of forearms at square application sites of 9 cm2, leaving a site per each arm for untreated control under occlusion (UCO) and without occlusion (UC). The volunteers were instructed not to use dermopharmaceutical and/or cosmetic products on the tested areas as well as to spend at least 30 minutes in a room in which the measure-ments were conducted in order to adapt to the temperature and relative humidity. After initial measurements, 0.016 g/cm2 of the investigated samples were applied, covered with silicone film and fixed with hypoallergenic adhesive tapes. Two hours upon removal of the 24-h occlusion, all param-eters were reassessed (Jak\u0161i\u0107 et al., 2012; Tasi\u0107-Kostov et al., 2011).Results and discussionThe investigated samples showed overall satisfying preliminary safety profiles (low in vivo irritation poten-tial). Namely, two hours after occlusion removal, all the investigated samples led to the significant upsurge of EC compared to the baselines and controls, revealing skin hy-dration potential probably related to appropriate vehicles themselves (D-V and N-V), bearing in mind lack of signif-icant differences after treatment with these samples com-pared to the matching active creams (D and N, respective-ly). There was no significant change in EI, which was even decreased for all the tested creams, indicating well-toler-ated skin formulations. Also, there was no significant in-crease of TEWL for the investigated samples compared to the baseline values, nor UCO. Significant growth of this parameter was detected after repeated measurement for the sample N compared to UC, but this increase cannot be at-tributed to the treatment with this sample itself, while the same difference between test-spots N and UC was also not-ed in the initial measurement.ConclusionIn conclusion, preliminary safety profile of the inves-tigated creams based on ingredients of natural origin can be considered satisfactory. Tested samples did not cause the change in the measured biophysical parameters-TEWL and EI, while they even increased EC i.e. stratum corneum hydration, a feature considered preferable in the cosmetic products intended for the treatment of aged skin.

Bitola, Macedonia* elenanaj@yahoo.comIntroductionIntravenous (IV) fluid therapy is a commonly used in hospitalcare practice as one of the essential element in pa-tient care. Over the years IV fluids in different forms have been specially designed  and developed according to the physiological demands of various patient\u2019s medical condi-tions. Understanding these IV fluids that are administered to the patient is important because each has a differentim-pact on the body and particular indications for use. There-fore, the choice of IV fluid should be based upon the hydra-tion status of the patient and metabolic disorders associated with the patient\u2019s condition. . Ringer\u2019s solution for infusion is chemically prepared an isotonic crystalloid that contains sodium chloride, po-tassium chloride, and calcium chloridein sterile water. The dosage of Ringer\u2019s solution is dependent upon the age, weight, clinical conditions of the patient, and concomitant therapy.This solution is indicated to replace extracellular fluid losses, to restore the sodium, potassium, calcium and chlo-ride balances and, as well as for treatment of isotonic de-hydration condition In practice, there are different recipes for Ringer\u2019s solution composition depending on its intended use. For example, lactated Ringer\u2019s solution is a hypotonic solution that the best approximate extra cellular fluid. It may be infused safely in large quantities in patients with condi-tions such as hypovolemia with metabolic acidosis, shock syndromes and burns. It is well known that lactate is metab-olized in the liver, and to a lesser degree inthe kidney while, acetate is metabolized mainly in the muscles and lesser in tis-sues such as kidneys and heart, so it\u2019s a good alternative in patients with impaired lactate clearance such as in advanced liver disease (Santoro et al., 2007; Zander, 2004). In general, there are three independent acid-base variables that need to be determined when studyingthe acid-base properties of IV fluids such as: the partial CO2 tension, the total concentration of nonvolatile weak acid (AToT), and the strong ion differ-ence (SID) (Kellum, 2002, 2005). Metabolic acidosis and al-kalosis are respectively caused by raising and lowering AToT while holding SID constant. Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis are respectively caused by lowering and raising plasma SID while clamping AToT. Fluid infusion causes acid-base ef-fects by forcing extracellular SID and A ToT toward the SID and A ToT of the administered fluid (Morgan, 2005). The SID of isotonic saline being 0, the infusion of large quanti-ties (as in correction of hypovolaemia, acute normovolaemic haemodilution, and cardiopulmonary bypass ) will dilute the normal SID of plasma and decrease pH. Using the Stewart equation, a balanced solution with a physiological SID of 40 mEq/Lwould induce a metabolic alkalosis  (Chappel, 2008; Morgan, 2005). In order to avoid this inducti; n, balanced so-lutions using organic anions such as lactate, acetate etc. in-creases the SID and also decreases the osmolarity of the so-lution (Bertrand, 2010; Chappel, 2008). Morgan has calcu-lated that a balanced solution should have a SID of 24 mEq/L (Bertrand, 2010; Morgan, 2005). In the field of surgery and intensive care, hyperchlore-mic acidosis is well-known problem in patients receiving large amount of standard electrolytes. A series of studie-shas emphasized the disadvantageous effects of hyperchlo-remic acidosis on various organ systems, for example, he-modynamics, NO-production, renal blood circulation, uri-nary output or hemostasis.Having in mind that there is a lack of Ringer\u2019s lactate and Ringer\u2019s acetate solution on the drug market in our country, the aim of presented work was to formulate these IV solutions, and to evaluate theirquality and stability. Pre-pared solutions, were used in our Hospital in the Depart-ment of Anesthesiology.S4 PP 176374Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 373 - 374 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsMaterial and methods The minimum conditions required for the small scale production and quality assurance of Ringer\u2019s   lactate and acetate   solutions   were  established by elaboration of the required Pharmacopoeias monographs (Ph.Eur.8th; USP 39). The IV fluids were prepared in laminar flow cabinet (LFC), using an aseptic technique along with sterile filtra-tion and filled in the sterile containers. Solutionswerester-ilized by autoclaving. The final solutionswerethen submit-ted to quality control, Results and discussion Prepared IV fluids had good quality in respect to phys-ical properties, physico-chemical parameters and microbi-ological quality according to Ph.Eur. 8. It was also con-firmed that IV fluids were stable for a year in the condi-tions of the second (II) climatic zone. Each of these IV so-lutions had a different profile in terms of impact on acid-base status, electrolyte levels, coagulation, inflammation, renal, and liver function. The choice of the best solution for patient resides in a complete understanding of the expect-ed response of each solution and the patient \u2018s risk factors. In the preliminary comparison study, Ringer\u2019s lactate as well as acetate- based IV solution, proved to be suitable for fluid replacement during surgery. Hemodynamic stabil-ity remained unaffected by both of the solutions. Concern-ing consistency of acid base parameters none of the solu-tions seemed to be inferior. ConclusionsIt has been revealed that prepared formulation of Ring-er\u2019s lactate and Ringer\u2019s acetate solutions can be success-fully used for fluid replacement.ReferencesKellum, J.A., 2002.

BBB is selective barrier that eclipsed the brain and isolates it from the circulating blood. It represents a major barrier for drug permeation, especial-ly of those molecules that are highly hydrophilic, ionisa-ble, contain more than 10 hydrophilic moieties, low logP value and molecular mass bigger than 400 Da. Distribu-tion of drug in system octanol/water is in correlation with its lipophilicity and its optimal value ranges between 2.5 and 5 (Pardridge, 1998). Most of newly developed drugs have poor permeability. Thus novel pharmaceutical formu-lations are developed containing drug permeators. Drug transfer across BBB could be facilitated using permeator enhancers (e.g. bile acids). Value logP in system octanol/water is dependent on drug solvent interaction (i.e. hydro-gen bonding), and because of this it is a poor predictor for BBB penetration, since this barrier is highly hydrophobic. Better system is cyclohexane/water since cyclohexane has no possibility for hydrogen bonding. If permeator that is most suitable could be predicted in vitro in preformulation investigations, it could decrease formulation development costs. Thus the aim of this study was to investigate glicla-zide distribution in systems n-octanol/water and cyclohex-ane/water as in vitro prediction models for in vivo BBB penetration. Also the aim was to determine whether men-tioned in vitro models could predict the influence of per-meators such is dexycholic acid (DCA) on gliclazide trans-fer across BBB.Materials and methodsDistribution coefficient (logD) was determined us-ing a \u201cflask shake\u201c method. In glass tubes 1 ml of organic solvent (cyclohexane or octanol) was mixed with 5 ml of aqueous phase. Partition profile was determined over phys-iological pH range (pH 1.2 HCl solution, pH 4.5 acetate buffer, pH 6.8 and 7.4 phosphate buffer and pH 7 distilled water) for 5 combinations of n-octanol or cyclohexane with aqueous gliclazide solution (10 \u00b5g/ml) of different pH and with or without the addition of DCA (0.5 mM) into n-octa-nol or cyclohexane phase. The analyses were done in tripli-cate for each pair of organic solvent/water. Concentrations of gliclazide were determined using modified high perfor-mance liquid chromatography method (Mikov, 2008). Val-ues of logD at pH 7.4 were compared with literature date of gliclazide BBB penetration and influence of DCA on its penetration (Lalic Popovic, 2012).Results and discussionGliclazide is a small lipophilic molecule which is ex-pected to readily cross biological barriers. However it has poor BBB penetration, and since it shows antioxidant properties on brain cells its penetration into central ner-vous system is of interest (Sandoval, 2009). Though some drugs do cross BBB, there is a great number of drugs like gliclazide for which BBB is impermeable. In this investi-gation a higher partition into organic layer was found in system n-octanol/water than cyclohexane/water. Profiles of distribution after 1 and 24 h were different which leads to a conclusion that 24 h is needed time for a partition to be finished in system cyclohexane/water. There were no observed differences in logD values after 1 or after 24 h between systems with and without DCA in n-octanol (pH S4 PP 177376Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 375 - 376 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / Biopharmacy6.8; 7 and 7.4), but minor differences were noticed in low-er pH values (i.e. pH 1.2 and pH 4.5). Also DCA signifi-cantly increased partition of gliclazide in system cyclohex-ane/water but not in system n-octanol/water. Value of logD at pH 7.4 without DCA in organic layer in system n-octa-nol/water was 0.34\u00b10.05 and in system cyclohexane/wa-ter was -0.74\u00b10.11. According to logD value in cyclohex-ane/water, gliclazide have poor BBB, which is in correla-tion with in vivo data (logBBB 0.23\u00b10.02 healthy animals and 0.85\u00b10.03 diabetic animals) (Lalic Popovic, 2012). Value of logD at pH 7.4 with DCA in organic layer in sys-tem n-octanol/water was 0.54\u00b10.07 and in system cyclo-hexane/water was 0.18\u00b10.01. Both systems showed in-creased transfer of gliclazide when DCA was present in or-ganic layer. This is also in correlation with in vivo investi-gation where animals were pretreated with DCA (logBBB 0.96\u00b10.03 healthy animals and 1.35\u00b10.14 diabetic animals) (Lalic Popovic, 2012).  Thus partition of gliclazide in sys-tem cyclohexane/water better correlates with in vivo data where penetration of gliclazide was increased with DCA pretreatement, but in diabetic animals, penetration was in-creased in group with and without DCA pretreatement and investigated in vitro systems could not this predict.ConclusionIncreased logD value in organic layer when DCA is present indicates existence of physicochemical interactions of DCA and gliclazide. Investigated system cyclohexane/water predicted poor gliclazide BBB penetration and the influence of DCA on gliclazide penetration but system n-octanol/water failed to do so. However investigated sys-tems could not predict differences in penetration between diabetic and healthy animals. Further investigations are necessary to determine value of system cyclohexane/water in prediction of BBB transfer.AcknowledgmentThis work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology Development of Serbia (41012 III).ReferencesLalic Popovic, M., 2012.

The pharmaceutical dosage product and its con-tainer closure system act together to serve as an integral unit. The primary packaging comes into direct contact with the product and it is the most significant component in the pharmaceutical product packaging. It serves the two main functions of protecting the product from outside influences that would otherwise render it useless while allowing the manufacturer of the product to package it using practices that typically involve automated form-fill-seal equipment. As innovations continue and new films enter the market, a thorough understanding of how regulatory, package perfor-mance and film attributes fit together should help ease the selection process and, hopefully, provide some framework to avoid potential problems throughout the life of the phar-maceutical product.CGMP requirements for packaging materials for par-enteral, inhalation and liquid products are wider than for solid oral dosage forms (FDA, 1999).ObjectiveCorrect selection of contact packaging has a signifi-cant impact on safety and efficiency. The goal is to choose the appropriate contact material for blister packaging. Prin-ciples and contribution to simplification and proper choice of packaging material are: out of the vast number of pack-aging materials to choose a range of materials that can be used for packaging a certain product, materials that meet quality requirements and are tested by the manufacturer, from reliable suppliers of high quality and favorable price, to fully comply with the equipment and resources for pack-aging at the factory. An analysis of the characteristics of materials for blister packaging was made.Critical factors in choosing the right blister packaging filmFor choosing the right blister packaging film it is nec-essary to have great knowledge of drug characteristics, physical and chemical properties, microbiological quality, technical considerations of blister films, dimensional sta-bility of the webs, ability for thermoforming and cooling of formed film, variation in thickness, compatibility of form-ing film and lidding foil.Films for blister packagingThe base in blisters produced by thermoforming pro-cess is a polymer plastic film. The blisters are formed un-der increased temperature. PVC film used for blister pack-aging represents a rigid film due to the absence of soften-ers and plasticizers, which provides structural rigidity and physical protection of the pharmaceutical dosage form. It is transparent, rigid material with a greattermoform abil-ity, easy to color and low cost. The main disadvantage is low barrier properties, high water vapor and gases perme-ability. PVDC has a significant role in blister packaging as lamination or coating of PVC. PVDC provides excel-lent barrier to gases and water vapor, unlike other poly-mers that provide either one or other protection. Perme-ability to gases does not depend on the relative humidity, so it can be used for packaging in various environmental conditions. The properties of the copolymer depend on the content of the VDC, greater amount of VDC result in better barrier properties, the smaller the amount of VDC the flex-ibility improves. The amount and type of co-monomer, as S4 PP 178378Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 377 - 378 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationswell as additives and manufacturing technology affect the properties of PVDC. The weight of PVDC coatings ranges from 40, 60, 90 and 120 g/m2. PVDC coatings have been used with duplex (PVDC/PVC) and triplex (PVDC/PE/PVC) structure being the most common ones used (Bauer, 2009). Aclar\u00ae has the lowest water vapor permeability of all the films used for blister packaging. It has good barri-er properties to gases, but this material is not used often in applications where impermeability to gases is primary de-mand. Aclar\u00aeUltRx (CTFE homopolymer) has the highest moisture barrier of any clear thermoplastic film. It process-es within the same range as other thermoforming films on conventional blister packaging equipment. PET has a high-er permeability to water vapor compared to PVC. PVDC - coated PET has a similar permeability to water vapor as PVDC. PS has very good thermoforming properties, but has high permeability to water vapor. PP has good barri-er properties to water vapor (similar to PVDC). The prob-lem is thermoforming. The temperature required for ther-moforming PP and the further cooling process must be pre-cisely controlled. There may be distortion of blisters in sec-ondary packaging due to the thickness of PP film. Another disadvantage is the thermal instability and the possibility of collection of the film after performing the process. The process of blister packaging on a standard blister machine with a PP is difficult to perform and is much slower unlike PVC. COC (Cyclic Olefin Copolymer) in multilayer com-binations with PP, PE or PETG has very good barrier prop-erties. Cyclic olefins have good thermoforming properties even for deep blister cavities. COC is used in combina-tion with semicrystal PE or PP polymers to improve ther-moform properties. The films are produced with co-extru-sion or lamination. COC does not contain halogen in mo-lecular structure comprising only from carbon and hydro-gen. COC is used for packaging which requires deep blis-ter cavities (Pilchik, 2000).Blisters produced by cold forming are formed mechan-ically without the use of temperature and have high barrier properties. OPA/aluminum/PVC/ALU has excellent barri-er properties for oxygen and is also impermeable to water vapor and therefore, it is the first choice of packaging ma-terial. Its cost per square meter can withstand comparison with PVDC. However, cold forming takes up more pack-aging material for the same number of tablets or capsules of the same size, unlike PVDC.Multilayer films can be laminated, co-extruded, or a combination of the two. In laminated films, all film layers are extruded separately and are bonded together by a ther-moset adhesive. In co-extruded films, the film is manufac-tured in a single-step operation in which the film layers are bonded together by a tacky thermoplastic polymer. These two manufacturing techniques can be combined. Flexible materials are used for the layers of the laminates, such as aluminum foils and films of polymer materials of varying thickness. With the right choice of a layer, a laminate with best suited properties for the packaging of a product at a low price could be obtained. Foil for the inner layer usu-ally has good barrier properties, the lowest permeability to gases and water vapor. The inner layer should not have in-teraction with the product. The possibility of shaping and closing is provided by inner layer that should be termoseal-able (PE, PVC, PS, PVDC) (Stagnaro, 2011).ConclusionThe categorization of the polymer film is made accord-ing to their barrier properties: WVTR (water vapor trans-mission rate) and permeability to gases. PVC has a signifi-cantly higher permeability to water vapor from all types of PVC/PVDC and all types Aclar\u00ae. PVC/PVDC and Aclar\u00ae are closely comparable values for WVTR, depending on the thickness of the impermeable layer in the polymer film. Gas permeability, especially O2 and CO2 is important when the product inside the packaging material is sensi-tive to oxidation. PVC and all types of Aclar\u00ae have signif-icantly higher oxygen permeability of all types PVDC film. OPA/aluminum/PVC/ALU has excellent barrier properties for oxygen and is also impermeable to water vapor.Identifying the most suitable blister packaging mate-rial is complex. It requires very good understanding of the film properties in relation to application/ machine parame-ters for getting an optimal packaging performance.ReferencesBauer, E.J., 2009.

Macedonia* vveljanoska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionClean rooms and associated controlled environments provide control of airborne particulate contamination to levels appropriate for accomplishing contamination-sensi-tive activities. Production of sterile pharmaceutical prod-ucts is regulated in a separate Annex 1 in European Guide-line for Good Manufacturing Practice (EU GGMP, 2008) and contains instructions for minimizing the risk of con-tamination of these specific products with particles, mi-crobes and pyrogens.Presented study represent a critical review of some tests in guidance document for pharmaceutical industry, used in the process of qualification and monitoring of clean rooms for the manufacture of sterile medicinal products. Qualification of clean rooms Qualification of clean rooms in pharmaceutical indus-try is comprised of different tests like air supply, air veloc-ity, air changes, flow pattern, filter integrity, pressure test, particle count, temperature, microbial count, relative hu-midity, noise level and vibration test.The purpose of air supply capacity test is to demon-strate that the air system is balanced and capable of deliv-ering sufficient air volumes as per design to maintained re-quired air change in the defined area. The air capacity is demonstrated by following the procedure of measuring air flow in supply and returned duct and air volume to meet the design required.The purpose of air velocity/uniformity test is to pres-ent the capability of the air system for delivering sufficient air volumes to maintain a minimum cross section veloci-ty under HEPA terminal filter modules. The measuring is performed by calibrated anemometer at numerous sites in order to provide one measurement for each 0.37 m2 filter area. For Laminar Flow sections air flows uniformity has to be 0.45 m/sec \u00b1 20%. Testing of air flow pattern is performed in order to check the interference due to turbulence eddies in unidi-rectional airflow area, like sampling and dispensing booth and under laminar airflow in microbiological area (Kit-ain, 2010) Visualizing the air patterns at numerous points in room is performed by Titanium Tetra chloride sticks. In several cases the test is done by operating the HVAC sys-tem of the sterile area and releasing smoke into unidirec-tional air stream at selected sites. There is no minimum GMP requirement for air changes per hour. Air flow into and out of a space should be based on providing the re-quired cooling, heating, relative humidity, pressurization, particulate control, ventilation. These factors generally re-sult in air change rates between 4 and 20. There is also no numerical requirement for relative pressurization in clean-room. The velocity and direction of airflow between spac-es should be adequate to reduce counter flow of airborne particulates or vapour contaminants for spaces where air-borne cross contamination is a concern (EU GGMP, 2008).All HEPA filters installed in the facility are tested for filter integrity test by using PAO (Poly-alpha-olefin) aero-sol into supply duct to the HEPA filter. Sampling of stream challenge is done with photometer and the instrument is set for this challenge. Cross contamination can originate from both the internal and external facility environment. In all air handling systems, the filtration should be evaluated for adequate arrestance of outdoor particulates. Any suitable particle counter instrument can be used for the measure-ments, with no effect of the measurement principle used. During the operation an air flow rate should be 0.03 m3/min. Measurement should be done at minimum 10 differ-ent representative room locations for one minute at each location at 1 meter height from the floor. It must cover the central location of personal traffic during normal produc-tion process (WHO, 2011). Measurements should obtain S4 PP 179380Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 379 - 380 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsinformation about concentration of two different ranges of particles: particles with size \u2265 0.5 \u00b5m as well as particles with size \u2265 5 \u00b5m (5 \u00b5m particles for ISO 5 class has been excluded from the limit value table), at each location (DIN EN ISO 14644-1, 2015; DIN EN ISO 14644 - 2, 2015).Room temperature variation often can be a critical pa-rameter in production processes. Most products, materials and processes can handle a wide range in temperature. The width of this range decreases as the exposure time increas-es. Existing HVAC system had designed for 24 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C to all critical area in manufacturing, warehouse and Quality Control department. Sometimes, for some products, in-processing temperature requirement shall be maintained 18 \u00b0C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C. Relative humidity may affect exposed product or materials that are sensitive to air moisture. Relative humidity generally has effect on aqueous product. Liquid product can lose moisture to a low humidity room over an extended period. HVAC system in sterile area is designed to maintain the required humidity. Relative hu-midity is checked by using calibrated humidity meter from different locations (DIN EN ISO 14644-1, 2015; DIN EN ISO 14644 2, 2015).Microbial monitoring of manufacturing clean rooms should include compressed gases, surfaces, room and en-closure air and any other materials and equipment that may produce a risk of contamination. Monitoring of the air should be performed on meter cubic air (active or pas-sive sampling) by using special instruments or settle plates which are opened for 4 hours and after that incubated. Sur-face sampling is conducted by using swab or contact plat, collecting the microbiological contamination from approx-imately 25 cm2 surface from numerous defined locations. Taking samples for microbiological monitoring of the area should be performed for a period of one year routine pro-duction in accordance with the sampling plan. Noise level may be present in the facility due to operation of variety of equipment, during processes etc. Requirements when per-sonnel noise exposure exceed an eight hours time weighed average sound level of 85 dBa. HVAC system has designed not to generate more than 70 dBa noises in critical area during its normal operation (Kitain, 2010).ConclusionClean environments should be certified as described in ISO 14644 series in order to meet their design classifi-cation requirements. The design, construction, and opera-tion involved in clean rooms and advanced aseptic clean rooms operations vary greatly, so it is difficult to general-ize requirements for parameters such as filter integrity, air velocity, air patterns, air changes, and pressure differen-tial. In particularly critical applications such as aseptic pro-cessing, a structured approach to physical risk assessment might be appropriate.Situations where some of the parameters are out of range with values defined by guidelines of pharmaceutical products manufacturing undoubtedly are reason for devia-tion. After researching the presumable causes, the goal is finding solution for solving the problem, its future preven-tion and reseting the qualified conditions of the cleanroom. Clean-room operators, particularly those engaged in aseptic processing, must strive to maintain suitable envi-ronmental quality and must work toward continuous qual-ity improvement of personnel operations and environmen-tal control. In general, fewer personnel involved in aseptic processing and monitoring, along with reduction in inter-ventions, reduces risk from contamination.ReferencesEU GGMP, European Guidelines to Good Manufacture Practice, 2008.

However, for probi-otics health benefit to be exerted, it is estimated that they should be administered in a therapeutic minimum of 10-6 to 10-7 CFU live probiotic cells per g final product (FAO/WHO, 2006). Providing and maintaining at least this num-ber of viable cells is a great challenge due to their sensi-tivity to the harsh processing and GI conditions prior tak-ing their place of action in the low intestine and delivering the claimed health benefits. For incorporation of probiotics into food or pharmaceutical products, the microencapsula-tion offers protection to the fine particles produced during freeze- or spray-drying of probiotic concentrates. Among the many techniques for microencapsulation, spray-dry-ing is one of the most challenging because of the low cost, industrial application, stability and throughput in cellular integrity while drying when optimized correctly. Howev-er, the spray-drying process parameters might have nega-tive impact on the outcome of viable cells. In addition, the choice of carrier material and its interaction with the bac-teria have importance on protection efficacy and affect the probiotic delivery. In search for novel probiotic microen-capsulated formulation that will combine favorable prop-erties of alginate (ALG) and polymer that will provide controlled and targeted release of viable probiotic cells in the lower intestine, we have encapsulated the probiotic L. casei 01 in ALG and soy protein isolate (SPI) matrix by spray-drying. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ef-fect of the critical formulation and process variables on vi-ability of the probiotic after spray-drying.Materials and methodsFD-DVS/Lactobacillus casei 01 was supplied from Chr. Hansen (Copenhagen, Denmark), SPI from Soja-protein AD (Becej (Serbia), whereas ALG (10/60 LS, fG 35%\u201345%) was kindly donated from Protanal FMC Bio-polymers (Ayrshire, UK). CaCl2, de Man, Rogosa, Sharpe agar and broth as well as peptone water were purchased from MerckKGaA (Darmstadt, Germany).  Aqueous mixture of ALG and SPI was inoculated with bacterial suspension (cell load ca. 12.5 log10 CFU/g), acti-vated as previously described (Petreska Ivanovska et al., 2014; Smilkov et al., 2014). The resulting mixture was in-fused into a spray-dryer nozzle unit of B\u00fcchi Mini Spray Dryer B-290 (B\u00fcchi Laboratorius-Technik AG, Switzer-land) and continuously sprayed at following conditions: S4 PP 180382Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 381 - 382 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsnozzle diameter 0.7 mm, aspirator pressure 90%, atomiz-er pressure 600 Nl h-1, flow rate 5 mL/min. SPI-ALG mic-roparticles (MPs) with encapsulated L. casei that were fur-ther subjected to additional cross-linking by CaCl2 were prepared by consequent introduction of the MPs obtained by spray-drying into aqueous solution of CaCl2, followed by continuous stirring at room temperature (1 h). MPs thus obtained were removed from the solution of CaCl2 by cen-trifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min), washed three times with sterile water, frozen at -20 \u00b0C and freeze-dried at 0.070 mbar and -50 \u00b0C for 24 h (Freeze-Dryer, Labconco, USA). Critical material attributes (concentration of ALG, SPI and CaCl2) and process parameters (inlet temperature, IT) were previously identified varying one parameter at time, while the influence of critical variables on viability of the probiot-ic after preparation was evaluated using face centered CC-RSM design (Design-Expert\u00ae V8, Stat-Ease, Inc., USA). The total of 30 experiments were designed and carried out, with the following actual levels of studied variables: ALG (A, 1 and 4%w/v), SPI (B, 1 and 4%w/v), CaCl2 (C, 0 and 5%w/v) and IT (D, 90 \u00b0C and 150 \u00b0C). Viability of the en-capsulated L. casei 01 in SPI-ALG MPs was assessed after dissolution of 1 g MPs in 9 g PBS (1 mol/L, pH 8.0), using the plate-count method as previously described (Petreska Ivanovska et al., 2014; Smilkov et al., 2014).Results and discussionViability of L. casei 01 in designed formulations after preparation was in range of 8.67-13.09 log10 CFU/g or ex-pressed in % related to initial L. casei 01 cell count from 68.38 to 99.61%. Influence of examined variables upon this response in terms of coded factors was described by reduced cubic model with the following equation:Viability(after preparation) (%)  = + 86.78 + 0.95 x A - 2.36 x B + 1.78 x C - 3.29 x D + 1.76 x A x C + 3.72 x A2 - 6.84 x A2 x CFrom the equation one can clearly see that the viabil-ity after preparation positively correlated with the factors A, C, AC and A2 and inversely with B, D, and A2C. With increase in ALG and CaCl2 concentration, the viability of the probiotic increased, while oppositely was observed with increase in concentration of SPI, suggesting compe-tition between the probiotic and SPI for the same bonding sites in ALG molecules. According to the literature data (Rajam et al., 2012), modification of the compactly folded protein molecules from their native form allows SPI-ALG interactions via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding as well. At the same time, a trend to segregation of SPI and ALG into separated microdomains can occur, which has also been confirmed when whey pro-tein as complexation agent was used (Smilkov et al., 2014). One way ANOVA indicated that variable D is significant model term, meaning that increase in the IT significantly decreases probiotic viability after preparation. The loss of probiotics during thermal processing is the main disadvan-tage of MPs production by spray drying and it is related to cellular injuries (e.g. denaturation of DNA and RNA, dam-age of ribosomes, dehydration of cytoplasmic membrane, lipid peroxidation and rupture of cell membrane) due to water removal resulting from the combined effect of heat and mechanical stress (Soukoulis et al., 2013). Thus, pro-tection from the IT of the spray-dryer, as a critical point in this method of microencapsulation, is required. In addition, the probiotic bacteria must be alive at the time of consump-tion of the product and also capable of reaching the large intestine in quantities that are sufficient to facilitate coloni-zation and proliferation. Therefore, probiotic loaded MPs should be customized in respect to their physicochemi-cal and biological/biopharmaceutical properties as well to make them suitable for incorporation into food or pharma-ceutical product as well as for administration in healthy in-dividuals and/or individuals with specific disease.ConclusionL. casei 01 loaded SPI-ALG MPs were prepared using spray-drying method, with viability of the probiotic after preparation significantly exceeding the minimal therapeu-tic value. Process and formulation parameters should be further optimized to obtain probiotic MPs with both, high viability after preparation and in simulated GI conditions.

Macedonia* edrakalska@yahoo.comIntroductionCurcumin is the active principle of the spice turmer-ic, produced by the rhizome of Curcuma longa (Zingib-eraceae), which is widely used in traditional eastern medi-cine as a hepatoprotective, anti-infectious and anti-inflam-matory remedy (Shehzad et al., 2010). A compelling body of recent evidence has shown that curcumin is endowed by pleiotropic antineoplastic effects, due to modulation of NFkB and other cell signaling pathways, implicated in cell survival, apoptosis and angiogenesis (Shehzad et al., 2010). Regretfully, the enormous therapeutic potential of curcumin can`t be exploited in clinical practice, due to its extremely unfavorable physicochemical and pharmacoki-netic characteristics, and also due to the instability in sys-temic circulation (Singh and Khar, 2006). The contribu-tion is focused on newly-synthetized octopus-shaped mac-romolecules, consisting of hydrophobic calix[4]arene core and four arms of hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) chains as platform for delivery of curcumin.Materials and methodsTwo methods for preparation of inclusion complexes were used:Heating method described by (Loftsson et al., 2005) with slight modifications. Briefly, to aqueous solutions of increasing concentrations of CX[4]PEG polyoxyeth-ylatedtertbuthylcalix[4]arene ) (2 mg/ml \u2013 12 mg/ml) a constant amount of curcumin (1 mg/ml) that exceeded its aqueous solubility (11 ng/ml) was added. The vials were closed and heated at 50 \u00b0C for two hours. After that, the samples were left at room temperature for 24 h. Then the samples were subjected to centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. The clear transparent supernatants containing the inclusion complexes were collected and the amount of the curcumin was analyzed using a validated UV/VIS spectrophotometric method at 427 nm.Solvent evaporation method: series of samples contain-ing a fixed concentration of curcumin (1 mg/ml) and in-creasing concentrations of CX[4]PEG (2-12 mg/ml) were prepared in absolute ethanol, and evaporated to dryness us-ing a Buchi rotation-type vacuum evaporator (R-215, Sig-ma-Aldrich). The concentrations of CX[4]PEG were cho-sen on the basis of its critical micelar concentration (CMC) of 7.7 mg/ml (or 0.24 \u00b5mol/ml) (Momekova et al., 2012). Thereafter the dried CX[4]PEG/curcumin containing films were hydrated with deionizaed water and were left for 2 h at 50 \u00b0C and then in dark at room temperature for 24 h. Then the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 5000 rpm. The transparent yellow supernatants containing the cur-cumin-CX[4]PEG complexes were analyzed for curcum-in content using a validated UV/VIS spectrophotometric method. Phase-solubility profiles were obtained by plotting the solubility of drug versus the excipient concentration.Characterization of the CX[4]PEG-curcumin complexationUV/VIS spectroscopy The UV/VIS spectra of curcumin (in absolute ethanol and 10% ethanol solution) and its CX[4]PEG complex (in deionized water) were recorded on JASCO V570 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with thermostatic cell holder (Huber MPC-K6 thermostat with precision 1 \u00b0C). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analysisSamples of pure curcumin, pure CX[4]PEG, their phys-ical mixture, and a lyophilized complex were characterized by an IRAffinity-1 Shimadzu FT-IR spectrophotometer. The scanning range was between 4000 and 400 cm-1.S4 PP 181384Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 383 - 384 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsDynamic light scattering (DLS) analysisThe size, size distribution patterns and zeta-poten-tial of curcumin loaded supramolecular CX[4]PEG aggre-gates were investigated by ZetaSizer NanoZS (Malvern In-struments), equipped with a 633 nm laser. The parameters were evaluated from the measurements at the scattering an-gle of 175 \u00b0 at 25 \u00b0C. In vitro curcumin releaseThe in vitro curcumin release from supramolecular BEC-X aggregates was evaluated by regular membrane di-alysis at 37 \u00b0C against phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 1 ml of tested formulations was placed in dialysis membrane tubing (MWCO 10,000). The dialysis bag was then placed in a temperature controlled vessel, containing 100 ml of PBS (pH 7). At various time intervals aliquots were tak-en from the released medium and assayed for curcumin by UV\u2013VIS spectroscopy.Results and DiscussionPhase solubility studiesThe phase solubility studies of curcumin with BEC-X were performed using the procedure utilized for the evalu-ation of cyclodextrin inclusion complexes by Higuchi and Connors (Higuchi and Connors, 1965). Due to their am-phiphilic nature, polyoxyethylated calyx(4)arenes (CX[4]PEG) can self-associate in water by forming well-defined spherical nanoparticles. At concentration below the CMC, CX[4]PEG drastically increased curcumin solubility by formation of inclusion complexes with high stability con-stant (Kc). A significantly higher solubility enhancement of curcumin was observed at concentration exceeding the crit-ical micellar concentration, attributed with additional solu-bilization of curcumin into the hydrophobic domains of the supramolecular aggregates by non-covalent interactions.UV/VIS characterizationIn order to characterize the spectral behavior of cur-cumin and its inclusion complex, absorption spectra of pure curcumin in absolute ethanol and 10% ethanol are compared with the absorption spectrum of the inclusion complex in water. The characteristic absorption peak of curcumin at 427 nm is identical in the three media under investigation, which demonstrates that the inclusion com-plex is formed by non-covalent hydrophobic interactions. An interesting finding is the appearance of a shoulder at 361 nm in the spectrum of pure curcumin dissolved in 10% ethanol which cannot be seen in spectra of curcumin in ab-solute ethanol and in the inclusion complex of curcumin in water. The shoulder can be attributed to the shifting of the tautomeric equilibrium from keto\u2013enol to diketo-form. FT-IR analysis FT-IR spectroscopy is a useful tool for characteriza-tion of inclusion complexes. Characteristic combination of a sharp peak at 3508 cm-1 and a broad peak at 3293 cm-1 in the curcumin spectrum implies the presence of aromatic OH group stretching vibrations (Kolev et al., 2005) and the inten-sive sharp peaks at 1626 cm-1 and 1601 cm-1 corresponding to mixed C=O and C=C vibrations and symmetric aromat-ic ring (C=C) stretching vibrations, respectively, did not in-terfere with the vibrations in BEC-X spectra and can be used as marks for description of curcumin in inclusion complex.DLS analysisPhysicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticles (size, size distribution and zeta potential were evaluated by DLS and the results revealed particles of app.180 nm with monomodal distribution (PDI below 0.2) and zeta potential of \u2013 20 mV suitable for systemic application.In vitro curcumin releaseThe in vitro curcumin release profiles from supramo-lecular CX[4]PEG aggregates were studied under simulat-ed physiological conditions for different incubation peri-ods from 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 hours. The results showed initial burst release of curcumin, followed by slower drug release. ConclusionThus on the grounds of the excellent in vitro bio-compatibility profile and the favorable physicochemical and drug loading characteristics of the tested liposomal nanoparticles, and their ability to retain the intrinsic phar-macological properties of encapsulated drug they could be considered promising drug delivery platforms for lipophil-ic curcumin.ReferencesHiguchi, T., Connors, K.A., 1965.

Therefore, re-cent trends in the development of ER dosage forms high-light the importance of the investigation of potential al-cohol-induced dose dumping (ADD) (Anand et al., 2011; Lennern\u00e4s, 2009). FDA and EMA guidances include gen-eral recommendations regarding the assessment of ADD, stating that suitable in vitro dissolution tests should be car-ried out to identify the risk of ADD, and differentiate be-tween rugged and vulnerable formulations (EMA, 2014; FDA, 2016). In addition, the International Pharmaceuti-cal Excipients Council Europe (IPEC) working group on ADD has summarized relevant scientific and regulatory in-formation to help pharmaceutical companies to better han-dle ADD issues. It has been recognized that increased sol-ubility of drugs or excipients in the presence of ethanol, and/or formulation factors (e.g. impaired ability to retard drug release), in conjunction with changes in physiological conditions after alcohol intake (e.g. delayed gastric emp-tying) are the key factors affecting the kinetics of drug re-lease from ER oral formulations. Knowledge about these factors can help to identify and develop ADD-resistant for-mulations.The purpose of this study was: (i) to evaluate different dissolution test setups to in vitro assess the effect of ethanol on dose dumping from ER tablets, and (ii) to evaluate the potential of the combined in vitro-in silico approach for the prediction of drug absorption profiles after concomitant al-cohol intake, using commercially available diclofenac so-dium ER tablets as model formulations.Materials and methodsDiclofenac sodium solubility was tested in various me-dia (0.1 M HCl pH 1.1 and USP buffers pH 6.8 and pH 7.4 without/with addition of 40% ethanol). Drug dissolu-tion from the investigated hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)-based tablets (ER1 - Diklofen\u00ae 100 mg diclof-enac sodium ER tablets, Galenika a.d., ER2 - Diklofenak 100 mg diclofenac sodium ER tablets, Hemofarm a.d.) was tested under different experimental conditions: (i) in pad-dle apparatus at 50 rpm, using single medium pH 7.5 (USP Test 1 for diclofenac sodium ER tablets) without/with ad-dition of 5% or 40% ethanol, and (ii) in basket apparatus at 100 rpm, using media change method (pH 1.1 without/with addition of 5% or 40% ethanol for 2 h, pH 6.8 for 2 h, pH 7.4 for 20 h). The later setup was designed to simu-late changes in physiological conditions as the drug trav-els along the gastrointestinal tract, and to approximate con-ditions in the stomach, since ethanol is mostly absorbed through the gastric mucosa. The obtained dissolution data, incorporated in drug-specific absorption model (Simcyp\u00ae Population-Based Simulator, v. 14.1; Certara\u2122, USA), were used for in silico simulations of drug plasma concen-tration-time profiles. Drug physicochemical and pharma-cokinetic properties, used as inputs for absorption model-ling, were obtained from available literature sources or in silico estimated.Results and discussionThe solubility study results indicated that solubility-limited drug dissolution from the investigated tablets can be expected only in medium pH 1.1 without ethanol. In other words, due to increased drug solubility in the pres-ence of 40% ethanol, concomitant intake of strong alcohol beverages might induce dose dumping from diclofenac so-S4 PP 182386Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 385 - 386 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsdium ER tablets even at low pH in the stomach. Dissolution data revealed that 5% ethanol in medium pH 7.5 had no significant effect on drug release rate from the investigated tablets (similar dissolution profiles). In ad-dition, drug release profiles from the two products were similar in medium pH 7.5 with 0% and 5% ethanol. The addition of 40% ethanol in medium pH 7.5 affected drug release rate from ER2 formulation, resulting in approxi-mately 4 times shorter mean dissolution time in compari-son to the drug release profile in simple buffer. On the oth-er hand, diclofenac sodium release under \u201cmedia change\u201d conditions was not affected by the exposure to either 5% or 40% ethanol in acidic medium (less than 10% of drug dissolved in 2 h; similar dissolution profiles). Considering these results, the observed difference in alcohol-resistance of the investigated products in medium 7.5 with 40% eth-anol is not expected to have significant effect on drug re-lease profiles in vivo. The simulated pharmacokinetic parameters, based on the selected input data set, including drug dissolution rate under \u201cmedia change\u201d conditions without ethanol (Cmax 0.50/0.55 \u00b5g/ml and AUC 4.12/3.91 \u00b5g/ml h for ER1 and ER2 tablets, respectively), were in agreement with the reported data from clinical studies (Altman et al, 2015). These results indicate that the employed in vitro dissolu-tion test conditions for diclofenac sodium ER tablets could be considered biorelevant. As expected based on dissolu-tion data, the presence of ethanol in acidic medium had no effect on drug absorption profiles (the simulated phar-macokinetic parameters were Cmax 0.41-0.58 \u00b5g/ml, and AUC 3.97-4.16 \u00b5g/ml h). Simulation based on the hypo-thetical dissolution scenario, illustrating the \u201cworst case\u201d, demonstrated that 100% diclofenac sodium release from 100 mg ER tablets in the stomach would alter the rate and extent of drug absorption (Cmax 2.56 \u00b5g/ml, tmax 2.16 h, AUC 6.43 \u00b5g/ml h), and consequently, the formulation would lose its modified release characteristics. But even this scenario would not pose safety issues for the patients, since the simulated plasma concentration profile is in the therapeutic range (Altman et al, 2015).ConclusionThe presented case demonstrate that in vitro disso-lution testing using the proposed \u201cmedia change\u201d exper-imental setup could be indicative of drug in vivo behav-iour in the presence of ethanol. In addition, the combined in vitro-in silico approach may provide insight into the ef-fect of ADD on drug clinical performance, and therefore, can serve as an alternative to clinical studies for ADD risk assessment. This approach should be encouraged, and ap-plied to other ER oral drug products.AcknowledgmentThis work was done under the project TR34007, supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of SerbiaReferencesAltman, R., Bosch, B., Brune, K., Patrignani, P., Young, C., 2015.

Their systemic use causes long se-ries of side effects, so combination therapies of drugs with systemic and local action or only medicinal products in-tended for topical use wherever possible, especially in physical therapy, would be treatment of choice.Various formulations of dosage forms, by composition and consistency, allow different therapeutic approach, suit-able for achieving the desired therapeutic effect and for be-ing capable to adapt to the physiotherapist treatment. According to the regulations of the pharmacopoeia or to other regulations, the galenic drugs are made in small batches in a galenic laboratory, which are intended to be administrated directly to a pharmacy or a health institution. According to the health requirements, the preparation of pharmaceutical dosage forms in a galenic laboratory, mainly aims to provide a dosage form, which is designed as an opportunity for changes in the composition and con-sistency of the product.  Therefore, it can be provided a product with a modified properties, compared with a fin-ished and fixed composition of the medicinal and an aux-iliary substances, or with the already existing traditional products, which have the same composition of active com-ponents, satisfying the needs of the healthcare profession-als who work with them and also allowing a simultaneous comfort and a therapeutic effect for the patients. The usage of this drug, immediately after the prepa-ration, reduces the need for adding more funds to stabilize and to ensure longer shelf life. Obtaining the quality of this drug product, that satis-fies the standards and maintains or enhances the therapeu-tic properties, requires appropriate conditions for a prep-aration and knowledge of all the components properties, technological process and requirements for the finished product as well. The usage of the traditional liquid, a  pharmaceutical product known as \u201cRussian water\u201d, which contains:  alco-hol, menthol, procaine hydrochloride and  benzocaine, is well received and accepted by the patients and the phys-iotherapists, but it also has some negative sides, such as, short effect, it is easily volatile, it acts surface and cannot be recommended as a massage supplement.  On the other hand, gels are a dosage forms for external use that can be applied easily, to tie up to the skin and to enable the drug to heal the affected area,it can realize deep action, such as the ability to quickly penetrate multi-layers on the skin, to be easily rinsed from the site of application and general-ly does not irritate the skin, which is largely satisfying for our requirements.  The aim of this study was to formulate and prepare gel formulation from the pharmaceutical composition named \u201cRussian water\u201d, with the ingredients: menthol, benzo-caine, procaine HCl, which is easy and pleasant to apply on the painful area, also effective to reduce the pain and the inflammation. Formulation challenge was slight solubility of some of the components, getting a stable product with a proper consistency, ensuring the release of the active ingre-dients, their affection on the skin and a prolonged action.Materials and methodsIn the formulation and preparation the following ac-tive substances were used: menthol (Alkaloid), benzocaine S4 PP 183388Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 387 - 388 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentations(Sigma Aldrich), procaine HCl (Sigma Aldrich), at the rec-ommended doses and ingredients, carbopol 940 (Sigma Al-drich), glycerol, (Alkaloid), triethylene tetramine (Sigma Aldrich) and aqua distillate.Gel with menthol, benzocaine and procaine HClwas prepared in the galenic laboratory in Ohrid -General Hos-pital.Used ingredients and a compounding procedure de-scribed in a rational manner are:menthol 4.0, benzocaine  2.0, procaine HCl 2.0, base gel ad 200.0. Basic gel was made with the following proscription:Carbopol 940 2.0, glicerolum 7.5, triethylene tetramine 2.5, aqua destilata 190.0.In the step 1, preparation of base gel, Carbopol 940 and aqua distillate 50 mL were left to bulge. Then glycer-olumwas gradually added and mixed to achieve good ho-mogenization. After that, triethylene tetraamin was add-ed and mixed again until thick gel was obtained.In the step 2, preparation of healing gel, the menthol was grind-ed through a sieve, and it was measured in the prescribed amount. It was mixed with the same amount of prepared basic gel to complete uniformity of the mixture. The ben-zocaine was grinded, sieved and measured at the prescribed amount and mixed with equal quantity of earlier prepared gel with menthol.The prescribed amount of procaine hydrochloride was measured and dissolved in distilled water 10mL. Then, the solution was gradually added to the gel with menthol and benzocaine, whileconstantly stirred.The remaining amount of distilled water was added, gradually and with constant stirring, to the homogeneous gel to obtain a homogeneous product.Results and discussionThe obtained gel is a homogeneous product with milk appearance. The high degree of pulverization of the com-ponents should improve solubility and ensure uniform dis-tribution of insoluble components in the mixture. The pro-cess of mixing equal amounts of the basic mixture and pul-verized substance also provides uniform distribution of the components, and the high density of the base gel reduces the possibility of their sedimentation (Allen, 2002; Jova-novic and Sekulovic, 1987; Racev and Lambov, 2005; Si-mov et al., 2001; Winfeld and Richards, 1998). Menthol is practically insoluble in water and because of its sole dis-tribution in the preparationit was pulverized and a special way for its incorporation into the system was applied.Ben-zocaine is poorly soluble in water and an appropriate pul-verization and mixing improved solubility and its uniform distribution in the product.The procedure of mixing and gradual addition of a small amount concentrated procaine hydrochloride solution reduces the possibility of decom-position of the gel structure under the influence of the po-tential ionic solution (Jackson and Lowey, 2010; Simov et al., 2001). The obtained gel is packaged in plastic recipients of 200 mL, closed with a suitable stopper and signed with red signature marked \u201cFor external use.\u201dIt is used topically by applying to the affected area and/or with good rubbing in physical therapy.The product has a short shelf life and is prepared immediately before use, and to ensure the qual-ity of the product it is recommended to be kept at a room temperature in well-closed recipients.During application it gives pleasant cooling sensation and pain relief and easi-ly rinse out with water. It is not toxic and does not cause skin irritation.The product can be prepared in galenic laboratory, and easy application and efficiency makes it acceptable to pa-tients (Jackson and Lowey, 2010). It has been retained at the administration site longer than the expected, and has longer actions regarding to the liquid alcohol solution, which is with the same components. ConclusionThe results of the treatment of patients according the investigation of the staff that operated and the practical pa-tients show that this gel is with a prolonged analgesic ac-tivity compared to the liquid preparation, with an easy and safe application, a pleasant cooling sensation and a pain re-lief, also an easy flushing and with an increased satisfac-tion of therapists and patients.ReferencesAllen, L.V., 2002.The art, science and technology of pharmaceutical compounding, 2nd Ed.Jackson, M., Lowey, A., 2010.

Various physical and chemical changes occur dur-ing their in-solution storage, leading to shorter shelf-life. Freeze drying is often proposed as a method of choice, since removal of water has been reported to greatly re-duce the rate of degradation, both in physical and chemi-cal terms. Still, during freeze-drying antibodies and other protein pharmaceuticals can experience in-process chang-es that may reduce their physicochemical biological and/or pharmacological properties. In this context, many attempts have been made to reduce these changes, both in optimi-zation of the freeze-drying process and in optimization of solution formulation, adding various buffers, cryoprotec-tants, etc. The presented experience was in freeze-drying of monoclonal antibody \u2013 rituximab, conjugated with three types of bifunctional chelating agents, p-SCN-Bn-DOTA, p-SCN-Bn-DTPA, and 1B4M-DTPA, and evaluation of possible changes in post-freeze-drying phase. In order to assess possible defragmentation of the antibody, protein in-tegrity test was performed, using SDS-PAGE electrophore-sis and the analysis of several structural elements of FT-IR and Raman spectra pre- and post- freeze-drying process, provided an insight in possible changes in the structure. Materials and methodsCommercially available rituximab (Mabthera\u00ae) was conjugated with three bifunctional chelating agents, p-SCN-Bn-DOTA, p-SCN-Bn-DTPA, and 1B4M-DTPA (Macrocyclics Inc. USA). The conjugates were synthesized, purified, adjusted to concentration of 1 mg/mL and freeze dried, using Labconco Free Zone Stoppering Tray Dry-er (USA), as previously described (Smilkov et al., 2014). The protein integrity was assessed using SDS-PAGE that was performed in about 5 \u00b5L of reconstituted samples and 1 mg/mL purified, commercial rituximab (Mabthera\u00ae). Samples were mixed with sample buffer and boiled 5 min at 95 \u00b0C. Approximately 5 \u00b5L of each preparation was applied in 12% bisacrylamide under reducing conditions. Visualization of the bands was enabled using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma, USA). For comparison, low molecular weight marker (Amersham GE Healthcare, UK) was used. For determining protein structure, FT-IR spectros-copy was conducted on PARAGON 1000 (Perkin Elmer, USA) spectrophotometer in the spectral range 2000\u2013500 cm\u20131. Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) spectra were ac-quired at a resolution of 4 cm\u20131. The obtained data was processed with Grams_32 software (Thermo Scientific). Raman spectra (2000\u2013400 cm\u20131) were recorded on a mi-cro-Raman multichannel spectrometer Horiba JobinYvon LabRam 300 Infinity, using He:Ne laser. The spectral reso-lution was set to 4 cm\u20131. The acquisition time and the accu-mulation number were set to 10 s and 10 scans, respective-ly (Gjorgieva Ackova et al., 2015).Results and discussionUsing SDS-PAGE electrophoresis it is possible to de-termine the purity and, therefore possible defragmentation. The electrophoresis in reducing conditions resulted in two distinct Mw species which migrated in two bands in all S4 PP 184390Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 389 - 390 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsthree rituximab conjugates. The upper band corresponded to ~50 kDa and the lower band to ~25 kDa. This migra-tion pattern is characteristic of IgG antibodies that have two identical subunits, each composed of two polypeptide chains: two heavy and two light chains, linked via four di-sulfide bonds. Under the action of the reducing agent DTT, the antibody is separated to heavy and light chains, with molecular weight corresponding to the two formed bands (Maleki et al., 2013; Nebija et al., 2011). The lyophiliza-tion protocol used did not affect structure properties and caused no post-lyophilization modification, as shown in the reducing SDS-PAGE lane patterns, compared to com-mercially available rituximab sample. Spectroscopy studies can reveal information to wit-ness preserved secondary structure upon freeze-drying, a mandatory prerequisite for immunoconjugates. Protein de-naturation upon lyophilization is usually monitored by IR spectroscopy (Murphy et al., 2012), although Raman spec-troscopy can also be applied (Wen, 2007). The IR spectra of all three rituximab conjugates re-vealed higher percentage of \u03b2-sheet conformation (antipar-allel and parallel) in the structure (strong band in the region between 1612 and 1640 cm-1, followed by a weaker band around 1685 cm\u20131), followed by \u03b1-helices (bands at 1655 or 1656 cm\u20131), as obtained in the band frequencies for am-ide I, II and III bands which are used as diagnostic bands. We observed that the freeze-dried rituximab conjugates re-gain their native conformation upon rehydration (revers-ible unfolding). Thermally-induced aggregation processes of the ma-jority of proteins can also be studied by FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy. Strong absorption bands below 1620 cm\u20131 can be correlated with aggregation, usually associated with the formation of new strong beta-sheet structures (Sch\u00fcle et al., 2007). With the lowest frequency band detected at 1620 cm\u20131 (in all samples analyzed), we concluded no ob-vious aggregation in all three freeze-dried antibody con-jugates. ConclusionAmong the many techniques available for evaluation of the structure and stability of freeze-dried antibody con-jugates, SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy can be employed in assessing structural prop-erties as well as in determination of stability of these poten-tial drug candidates.

Reducing toxicity to the health cells and potential drug degradation is important for achieving an effective treatment (Chan-da et al., 2011; Kaur and Kakkar, 2010). Liposomes are considered to be excellent models of cell membranes, as well as for stabilizing the pharmaceutical active substanc-es (Chanda et al., 2011; Kaur and Kakkar, 2010). Phospho-lipids and cholesterol assembled in one or more lipid bi-layers with an aqueous core are the main components in the microscopic spherical liposome vesicles (Chanda et al., 2011). The specific characteristics of the liposomes such as non-toxicity, flexibility, targetability to specific cells or tis-sues, and biodegradation make them drug carriers, reduc-ing drug toxicity through encapsulation (Kaur and Kakkar, 2010; Patel et al., 2009). The importance of their utilization is due to the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic, hydrophil-ic, and amphiphilic active pharmaceutical substances (G\u00f3-mez-Henz and Fern\u00e1ndez-Romero, 2006; Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2012). Generally, liposome formulations are classi-fied based on their structural characteristics, substances in their composition, size and lamellarity, method of prepara-tion, and their application (Kaur and Kakkar, 2010; Sahas-rabuddhe et al., 2012). Ketoconazole (cis-1-acetyl-4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxo-lan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]piperazine) is a chiral lipophilic imidazole antimycotic drug administered mainly as a race-mic mixture (50:50) of enantiomers in the cis configura-tion. The decomposition of the drug could be easily caused through acidic, chemical, photolytic, and oxidative con-ditions. Commercially available ketoconazole pharma-ceutical dosage forms such as topical cream, antidandruff shampoo, ointments, and tablets possess anti-inflammato-ry and some antibacterial activities (Patel et al., 2009; Sa-hasrabuddhe et al., 2012). Potential nephrotoxicity, hepato-toxicity, and decomposition of ketoconazole require prep-aration of new safety formulations (Patel et al., 2009). In the ketoconazole liposome preparation, a thin-film hydra-tion (Patel et al., 2009) and an injection method using ei-ther chloroform (Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2012) or dichloro-methane (Patel et al., 2009) were described. The potential adverse effects of alkyl halide solvents (WHO, 2004) em-phasize the aim of this work for introducing less toxic sol-vent such as methanol in ketoconazole liposome prepara-tion through injection method. Materials and methodsStandard ketoconazole was received as a gift from Pharmaceutical Company Replek Farm DOOEL\u2013Sko-pje, Republic of Macedonia. Analytical grade methanol, HPLC grade methanol and water were supplied from Mer-ck (Germany). Cholesterol was supplied from Calbiochem (Japan) and L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk) was from Sigma (Germany). Potassium hydrogen phosphate and po-tassium dihydrogen phosphate were supplied from Alka-loid AD (Republic of Macedonia). An analytical balance Mettler Toledo (Switzerland) was used for the sample S4 PP 185392Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 391 - 392 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsweighing with 0.1 mg accuracy. A magnetic stirrer (type MM\u2013530 Tehnika \u017delezniki, Slovenia), a rotary evapo-rator (Devarot Elektromedicina, Slovenia), and a centri-fuge (MRC, Pharmachem, Republic of Macedonia) were used in the ketoconazole vesicle preparation. An Agilent Technologies 1200 high-pressure liquid chromatograph-ic (HPLC) system (USA) equipped with a diode array de-tector (G1315D), a binary pump (G1312A), a degasser (G1379B), a thermostatted column (TCC G1316A), and an autosampler (ALS G1329A) were used for the encap-sulation efficiency determination of ketoconazole in lipo-some formulations. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a column LiChrospher\u00ae100 C-18 (150 mm length x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 \u00b5m particle size) with a mixture of methanol and water (90:10 v/v) mobile phase adjusted to pH 8.90 with a phosphate buffer. The absorbance was re-corded at 296 nm. The morphology of ketoconazole lipo-somes was determined with an optical microscope Konus, (type M\u2013100\u2013FL, Italy), equipped with a digital camera (Sony, Cyber\u2013shot W, type DSCW830V.CE3) and a lens ZEISS Vario\u2013Tessar 8x (China).   Ketoconazole, L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine, and choles-terol in the weight ratio of 3.3:1:3.3 w/w/w were trans-ferred with 5 mL methanol in a 100 mL round-bottom flask. Following the homogenization process on the mag-netic stirrer at 1000 min-1, methanol was evaporated in the rotary evaporator at 55 \u00b0C and 80 min-1 (10 min). The lip-id mixture was added to a portion of 5 mL distilled water (80 \u00b0C). The ketoconazole liposome mixture was left over-night in order to mature at 4 \u00b0C. The separation of the li-posome and free amount of ketoconazole was done in the centrifuge at 5000 min-1 for 10 min.Results and discussionIn the preparation of ketoconazole liposomes through injection method, the solubility of ketoconazole was con-sidered as a criterion of choosing less toxic methanol in-stead of chloroform (Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2012). The large unilamellar ketoconazole liposome vesicles were prepared using the injection method with methanol. The determined encapsulation efficiency of the ketoconazole li-posome formulations in methanol of 45% was smaller in comparison to the encapsulation efficiency of the ketocon-azole in chloroform (71%) obtained by Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2012. The smaller encapsulation efficiency was justi-fied with harmless preparation conditions of ketoconazole liposome formation with methanol. The encapsulation effi-ciency and morphological appearance were followed with evaluated stability of ketoconazole liposome formulations at 4 \u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C, during a month. After the first week and one month of the liposome preparation, during stabil-ity test at 4 \u00b0C, the encapsulation efficiency was 43% and 40%, respectively. At 25 \u00b0C, the encapsulation efficiency was decreased to 40% after the first week of the prepa-ration, while after one month, the determined encapsula-tion efficiency was 45% less than the initial value. The uni-formed liposome appearance with a tendency of aggrega-tion at higher temperature (25 \u00b0C) during one month sta-bility test was confirmed using microscopic analysis. The drug leakage increases at higher temperature as a result of higher lipid fluidity (Patel et al., 2009).ConclusionThe injection method using methanol could be applied in the ketoconazole liposome preparation. Process and for-mulation parameters should be further optimized to obtain vesicles with higher encapsulation efficiency, improving stability after preparation, as well as in simulated condi-tions, and sterilizing the obtained liposomes.

It has been widely used in numerous quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predict-ing the pharmaceutical properties of molecules (Hughes, 2008). Determination of distribution coefficient is com-monly used to predict the drug transport through biological membranes and to test the effect of drug promoters on drug distribution (fani\u0107, 2016). Bile salts are known for their function as modifiers of drug penetration across the bio-logical membranes (Stojan\u010devi\u0107, 2013). The effect of bile salts on drug penetration appears to be complex and it de-pends on the physico-chemical properties of the drug and on interactions of the bile salt with the physiological en-vironment. Taking into account that simvastatin (SV) is a highly lipophilic compound with extremely low water-sol-ubility and bioavailability (<5%), many efforts have been made to increase the aqueous solubility of the drug conse-quently leading to the increase of its bioavailability. Ac-cordingly, the aim of this study was to estimate the influ-ence of semysinthetic bile salt, sodium 12-monoketocho-late (MKC), on the distribution coefficient of simvastatin and to suggest molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect.Material and methodsDistribution coefficients (logD) of SV with or with-out MKC were determined using a \u201cflask-shake\u201c meth-od at pH 5 and pH 7.4, resembling gastrointestinal envi-ronment. The aqueous media used for these pH conditions were 0.1 M sodium acetate and 0.035 M sodium phosphate buffer, respectively, while octanol was used as organic sol-vent. Experiments were performed according to the pro-cedure described by Serajuddin et al. (1991). Concentra-tions of SV were determined by high performance liquid chromatography method according to method described by Carlucci et al. (1991). The detection was performed at 238 nm.  In order to analyze theoretically complexation of SV with MKC, semi-empirical PM3 method implemented in MOPAC software package in the Chem3D Ultra 7.0.0 pro-gram has been applied. It was also used for computation of physico-chemical properties of observed compounds to give a better interpretation of obtained in vitro results. Data were analyzed using OriginPro Software (OriginLab Corporation, MA, USA).Results and discussionAs a highly lipophilic molecule and weak acid, in more acidic environment, SV is expected to be more in its neu-tral form that can more easily penetrate biological barriers which explains higher values of distribution coefficient at lower pH (4.70\u00b10.01 at pH5 vs. 4.59\u00b10.06 at pH7.4). The experimental logD values of SV were in good agreement with the calculated logD values reported by Serajuddin et al. (1991). Upon addition of MKC, the distribution coeffi-cient of simvastatin significantly decreased at both select-ed pH (4.60\u00b10.02 at pH 5, and 4.41\u00b10.05 at pH 7.4). This means that the concentration of SV, i.e. the solubility of simvastatin, in buffer layer is increased in the presence of bile salts. Value logD in system octanol/buffer is dependent on drug solvent interaction. Chemical structure of bile ac-ids is different from ordinary aliphatic surfactants, due to S4 PP 186394Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 393 - 394 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsthe presence of a large, rigid, and planar hydrophobic moi-ety of a steroid nucleus carrying 2\u20134 hydroxyl groups and an ionic head of a carboxyl group, which provide the mol-ecule a planar polarity with hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains (Mikov, 2006).The increase in SV solubility cor-relates with known high hydrophobicity of SV for which strong hydrophobic interactions with the lipophilic steroid nucleus of bile salt are to be expected and are confirmed in analyzed complex SV-MKC. Significantly higher val-ues of Conolly Accesible Area (SAS), Conolly Molecular Area (MS), and Conolly Solvent Excluded Volume (SEV) of SV-MKC complex than SV alone additionally support experimentally obtained results. MKC has similar struc-ture to cholic acid, differing only in a keto group at the position 12 instead of hydroxyl group. It has been shown that replacing of hydroxyl with keto group in MKC result-ing in decreased membrane toxicity without compromising ability to enhance membrane permeability (Lalic-Popovic, 2013; Stojan\u010devi\u0107, 2013), which makes it as a good candi-date for the novel drug formulations. ConclusionOur data indicate that the addition of MKC into the octanol/buffer system decreases the values of SV distribu-tion coefficient. This may be the result of the formation of hydrophilic complexes increasing the solubility of SV that could consequently lead to the increase of its bioavailabil-ity. Results of this study could contribute to the develop-ment of new formulations with improved pharmacokinetic properties and enhanced bioavailability of SV.Acknowledgement This work is supported by Ministry of Education, Sci-ence and Technological Development of Serbia, Project III41012.ReferencesCarlucci, G., Mazzeo, P., Biordi, L., Bologna, M., 1992.

Cyril and Methodius\u201d, Mother Theresa 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* j_klopcevska@yahoo.comIntroductionThe pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) which belongs to the genus Capsicum is a widely cultivated and distribut-ed vegetable crop (Huq and Arshad, 2010). It is consist-ed of carbohydrates, proteins, carboxylic acids, miner-als, vitamins, and other biologically active compounds. The green, yellow, orange, and red pepper colour is de-pendent on a carotenoid pigment profile. Capsaicin as the main capsaicinoid compound determined the pungency in the red hot pepper (Kumar et al., 2011). Although the pep-per is produced seasonally, it is consumed throughout the year in either various specialties or spices and oleoresin extracts (Huq and Arshad, 2010; Kumar et al., 2011). The pepper is not only popular spice, but it could also be used in plant based insecticide formulations (Huq and Arshad, 2010). The Capsicum annuum L. could be differed from shape, pungency level, colour, and content of biochemi-cal compound. The colour could be evaluated from sur-face and extractable colour aspects (Malacara, 2011). The red colour intensity is considered as the main quality attri-bute of the red pepper and oleoresins, since it influences on both consumer acceptance and commercial value. The surface colour is dependent on pepper species and condi-tions during growing, storage, and processing (Belovi\u010d et al., 2014). Many factors affect pepper colour loss such as photolytic and thermal conditions, as well as the oxidative degradation of carotenoid pigments (Belovi\u010d et al., 2014). Several different methods for the pepper colour evaluation, based on the surface colour measurement and profiling of the carotenoids are reported in the literature (Belovi\u010d et al., 2014). Surface colour measuring is the method for de-scribing colour changes closest to sensory visual percep-tion (Malacara, 2011). In this work the influence of the par-ticle size at extraction of pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk of red hot pepper of Macedonian origin was studied by the determination of the extract yield and surface CIE Lab co-lour values.  Materials and methodsThe red hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L., spp. mi-crocarpum longum conoides, convar. Horgoshka) was grown in the locality Markova Cheshma, Prilep, Republic of Macedonia. Dried fruits of the red hot pepper were cut manually longitudinally with a knife. Pericarp was separat-ed from the seed, placenta, and stalk. Analytical grade pe-troleum ether (40\u201360 \u00b0C) was supplied from Merck (Ger-many). An analytical balance Mettler Toledo (Switzerland) was used for the sample weighing with 0.1 mg accuracy. The samples were ground using a Retsch ZM1 mill (Ger-many). The extraction of the red hot pepper (10 g \u00b1 0.1 mg) was carried out with Soxhlet procedure using petro-leum ether (40\u201360 \u00b0C). After 420 min extraction, the sol-vent was removed at 40 \u00b0C, 200 mPa using a rotary evap-orator (Devarot Elektromedicina, Slovenia). The steps of S4 PP 187396Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 395 - 396 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsdrying, cooling, and weighing were repeated until the dif-ference between two consecutive weights was smaller than 2 mg. The yield of the extract was calculated based on the dry matter weight of the red hot pepper sample used. The extraction procedure was performed in duplicate under the same operating conditions. Visual colour of the samples investigated was evaluated measuring the CIE Lab coor-dinates L* (lightness\u2013darkness), a* (red\u2212green), b* (yel-low\u2212blue), chroma (C), and Hue (h\u00b0) using Dr. LANGE spectra colorimeter (Chelmsford, UK). Colour difference (\u0394E) was calculated from a*, b*, and L* parameters, using Hunter-Scotfield\u2019s equation (Erg\u00fcne\u015f and Tarhan, 2006). Results and discussionAt extraction with petroleum ether (40\u201360 \u00b0C), 6.42% extract yield was obtained from pericarp with 0.25 mm particle size. Increasing the pericarp particle size from 0.5 to 1 mm, the extract quantity decreased, from 4.60 to 2.68%, respectively. The extract yield from red hot pep-per placenta with 0.5 mm particle size was 7.05%. The dif-ference in the extract quantity obtained from the placenta with 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm particle size was 1.49%. At seed extraction, the highest quantity of the extract was obtained in comparison to pericarp, placenta, and stalk. The highest extract yield of 22.32% was determined at seed extraction with 0.5 mm particle size. The obtained stalk extract quan-tity was the lowest, 3.70, 2.98, and 1.98% with particles size of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mm, respectively. The empirical models tested showed a good agreement between experi-mental and calculated data for the extract yield (R2> 0.90). The values of colour parameters varied between the sam-ples of pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk of red hot pepper. According to the L* values, seed samples were character-ized by the brightest (72.28), while pericarp samples by the darkest colour (54.26). The determined values of the co-lour parameter L* for placenta and seed were close to each other (65.59). High values of redness, a* (32.11) and satu-ration, C (41.94) were measured for the pericarp samples. The estimated value of a*/b* ratio in seed was the low-est. Hue (h\u00b0) values were linear correlated (R2 = 0.9793) with the values for the ratio of red (a*) and yellow colour (b*). The values of the L*, a*, b*, and C decreased with increasing the sample particle size (p< 0.05). The sample with 0.25 mm particle size was whiter, vivid, and deep red in colour than samples with particle size of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm. The highest colour difference before and after extrac-tion with petroleum ether (40\u201360 \u00b0C) was determined for the pericarp with 0.25 mm particle size (\u0394\u0415 = 27.12). In-creasing the particle size from 0.5 to 1.0 mm, \u0394\u0415 for peri-carp was decreased from 22.72 to 14.78. The influence of the particle size during extraction of placenta is insignifi-cant. For placenta with 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm particle size, estimated \u0394E values were 19.28 and 18.67, respectively. The lowest \u0394E values were determined during stalk extrac-tion. The values of colour parameters for obtained extracts from pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk at extraction with petroleum ether (40\u201360 \u00b0C) correlated with the determined colour values of the samples before and after extraction. The colour of red pepper is controlled by carotenoids. Cap-santhin, capsorubin, and xanthophylls are responsible for the red, while \u03b2-carotene and zeaxanthin for the yellow-orange colour. The red colour of different spices of pep-per is mainly due to the biosynthesis of keto-carotenoids such as capsanthin and capsorubin (Erg\u00fcne\u015f and Tarhan, 2006). The published data for the surface colour were relat-ed to the pericarp as an edible part of the pepper fruits. The differences in the pepper varieties, the maturity degree of the pepper, as well as the influence of drying and process-ing conditions were studied using characteristics of the sur-face colour (Belovi\u010d et al., 2014; Zaki et al., 2013). Results for the visual colour samples of pericarp are in agreement with those reported in the literature (Belovi\u010d et al., 2014; Erg\u00fcne\u015f and Tarhan, 2006; Zaki et al., 2013).ConclusionThe extraction of pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk of red hot pepper was carried out with petroleum ether (40\u201360 \u00b0C). The bigger particle size enabled to obtain less extract yield. The highest quantities were extracted from seed, while the lowest quantities from stalk. The colour differ-ences increased with decreasing the particle size. The high-est colour differences were estimated at extraction of peri-carp.

The most com-mon known essential oils are those from lemongrass, oreg-ano, peppermint, rosemary, thyme, cinnamon, and clove. A variety of volatile compounds such as terpenoids, phe-nol-derived aromatic and aliphatic compounds were deter-mined in the essential oil composition. The essential oils are recognized for their medicinal value such as analge-sic, sedative, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, and locally anaesthetic remedies. As a powerful natural products with bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, antiparasitical, and in-secticidal properties, the essential oils take a significant place in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industry, as well as in agriculture (H\u00fcsn\u00fc Can Ba\u015fer and Buchbauer, 2010). Concerning the complex chemical composition, the essential oils could be easily decomposed. Oxidative and photolytic conditions resulted in a quality loss and reduc-ing of the biological activity (Bilia et al., 2014). In order to protect and to use in drug delivery systems, nanoencap-sulation of the essential oils was proposed due to their ca-pability of improving the solubility, stability, and effica-cy of essential oil-based formulation. Nanoemulsion is dis-persion of two immiscible liquids with droplet size ranging from 20 to 200 nm (Sol\u00e8 and Solans, 2013). Low and high energy methods are used in the development of nanoemul-sion formulation. The high energy method required the me-chanical energy such as an ultrasonic procedure and a high pressure homogenization. On the other hand, surfactants as emulsifiers either in aqueous phase titration or in sponta-neous emulsification low energy method are used (Schuh et al., 2014).The objective of this study was to develop stable nano-emulsions of wild oregano essential oil using low energy emulsification methods.Materials and methodsSurfactants: Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan mo-nooleate, Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Germany), Tween 20 (polyoxy-ethylene sorbitan monolaurate, Merck, Germany), and Span 80 (sorbitan monooleate, Fluka, Germany) were used. Propylene glycol (PG) was supplied from Aldrich (Germany). Wild oregano essential oil (Origanum minu-tiflorum) produced in Turkey was purchased from Inter Connection Group DOOEL (Republic of Macedonia). Mil-liQ PURElab Classic system (ELGA, USA) supplied ultra-pure water.. An analytical balance Mettler Toledo (Switzer-land) was used for the sample weighing with 0.1 mg accu-racy. A magnetic stirrer (type MM\u2013530 Tehnika \u017delezniki, Slovenia) and a vortex (EV\u2013102 Tehnika \u017delezniki, Slove-nia) were used in the preparation of the wild oregano na-S4 PP 188398Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 397 - 398 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsnoemulsion formulations. Pseudo ternary phase diagrams consisting of wild oregano essential oil, mix of surfactans Tween 20, Tween 80 and Span 80 (Smix), and water were constructed using aqueous titration method (Shaaban and Edris, 2015). In glass vials, the wild oregano essential oil was mixed with Smix in weight ratios from 1:9 w/w to 9:1 w/w and was titrated with calculated amount of aque-ous phase (water or water and PG in the ratio 1:1 w/w). After 24 h the samples were monitored, visually inspect-ed for transparency and followability and water was add-ed. The phases were identified as transparent/translucent emulsion, transparent gel, turbid gel or turbid/milky emul-sion. The visually evaluated mixtures and nanoemulsion phase were marked on the phase diagram. The droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), and \u03b6-potential were measured with Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, United Kingdom) 24 h after the emulsion preparation.Spontaneous emulsification in three step process method was employed (Schuh et al., 2014). In the first step organic and aqueous phase were prepared. The homoge-neous organic phase contained oregano essential oil, lipo-philic surfactant Span 80, and ethanol as water miscible solvent, while aqueous phase was composed of water and hydrophilic surfactants, Tween 20 or Tween 80. In the sec-ond step organic phase was injected into the aqueous phase by stirring on the magnetic stirrer for 30 min at 750 min-1to reach phase system equilibrium. In the third step, etha-nol was evaporated on a BUCHI rotary evaporator system type R-114 and vacuum controller B-721 (Switzerland) at 40 \u00b0C, 250 bar, 1 h. The influence of the surfactant mix-ture (Tween 80 and Span 80 or Tween 20 and Span 80) and the surfactant to oil ratio on the droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), \u03b6-potential, the particle size distribution, and average particle diameter were determined 24 h after the emulsion preparation.Results and discussionIn the phase diagrams constructed using the oil, Tween 80, and a surfactant mixture of Tween 80 and Span 80 in the ratio of 2:1 w/w and 1:1 w/w, the effective surface of formed nanoemulsion was smaller. The maximum amount of water incorporated in the system was 23%. As a result of the small amount of water, as well as the high nanoemul-sion density, the preparation of water based nanoemulsion was disabled. Substituting Tween 80 with Tween 20 and changing water with a mixture of water and PG in the ra-tio of 1:1 w/w, nanoemulsion surface increased. When the oil and the Smix in the ratio of 1:9 w/w were used, the formed nanoemulsion could be fully diluted with water without the formation of turbid-white emulsion. The av-erage droplet size measured 24 h after preparation was 44 nm, while PDI was 0.349. Transparent emulsion was not formed when mixture of Tween and Span 80 in the ratio 1:2 w/w was used.The droplet size of the nanoemulsion prepared using the spontaneous method influenced by the surfactant mix-ture (Tween 80 and Span 80 or Tween 20 and Span 80) and the ratio of the mixed surfactants and oil (the weight ratio of Smix:oil was 0.5, 1 and 1.5 w/w). The droplets with 160 nm particle size, 0.097 PDI, and -26 mV \u03b6-potential was obtained using a mixture of Tween 20 and Span 80 mixed with the oil in ratio of 0.5. Using the surfactant mixture of Tween 80 and Span 80 in the proportion of 0.5 with the oil, the droplets with 180 nm particle size, 0.134 PDI, and -20 mV \u03b6-potential were obtained. Increasing the Six to oil ra-tio at 1 and 1.5, nanoemulsions with bigger droplets were obtained. The average droplet size of Tween 20 or Span 80 mixture oil in the proportion of 1.5 was 361 nm, while PDI was 0.071 and a low \u03b6-potential value was recorded (-2.69 mV).   ConclusionThe low energy methods, aqueous titration and spon-taneous emulsification method can be used in order to pro-duce fine droplet nanoemulsions of wild oregano essential oil. Aqueous titration method requires high concentration of surfactants at low oil concentration. Spontaneous emul-sification method can only be applied when low oil con-centration, less than 1%, is used. In order to improve the emulsification efficiency of the essential oil with high con-centration of carvacrol as a biological active compound and to increase the stability of the nanoemulsions prepa-ration using aqueous titration and spontaneous emulsifica-tion method, the process and working parameters should be optimized.

Every enterprise should have a methodology for iden-tifying and evaluating the risks it faces and it should have a process for generating intervention plans to reduce the risks to an acceptable level. This process is generally re-ferred to as a Quality Risk Management (QRM). QRM is a systematic process for the assessment, control, commu-nication and review of risks to the quality of the medicinal product across the product lifecycle. Early in development, the purpose of the QRM process may be to acquire suffi-cient product and process knowledge to assess risks asso-ciated with formulation development of the finished phar-maceutical product according to the quality target product profile. As development progresses, in addition to support-ing that development, the purpose of the QRM process is to determine and manage risks to bioavailability, safety, ef-ficiency and product quality.Risk assessment is a systematic process of organizing information to support a risk decision to be made within a risk management process. It consists of the identification of hazards and the analysis and evaluation of risks associ-ated with exposure to those hazards. Packaging represents a critical manufacturing op-eration requiring strong Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and quality oversight to ensure sustained and ro-bust compliance. Historically, inadequate packaging prac-tices have been a meaningful ongoing contributor to prod-uct recall actions industry-wide. A strong understanding of the compliance risks associated with product packaging is a necessary and important component of a good quali-ty system. The goal of risk assessment is to further enhance the quality assurance of existing packaging operations and practices (Guidance for industry \u201cQ9 Quality Risk Manag-ment\u201d, 2006) (Quality Risk Management Q9, 2005).Risk assessmentThe aim of risk assessment in blister packaging is to identify, analyse and evaluate risks during blister packag-ing process validation and the manufacturing processes.Risk identification is a systemic use of information to identify potential sources of harm referring to the risk or problem. Information can include historical data, theoret-ical analysis, and the concerns of stakeholders. Risk iden-tification addresses the \u201cWhat might go wrong?\u201d question and provides the basis for further steps in the quality risk management process (Reddy et al., 2014). Risk analysis is the estimation of the risk associated with the identified hazards. It is the qualitative or quantita-tive process of linking the likelihood of occurrence and se-verity of harms (detectability) is also a factor in the estima-tion of risk (Reddy et al., 2014). A team is assembled to collect relevant data about the packaging line. All operations involved with the line func-tion (equipment, procedures, etc.) and all corresponding potential failures are listed. For each potential failure, the team works to understand its potential impact on packaging operations and then respectively to assign a severity cate-gory. Following severity classification, the team is review-ing all dominant causes relevant to the defined potential failure and then assigning a frequency category. For each potential failure, all safeguards (e.g. detection capabilities) are reviewed and a detection capability is assigned. For Se-verity Frequency and Detection determination, all relevant data is  taken into consideration, to include maintenance and operation logs, batch records, deviation investigations, customer complaint records, etc. (Reich et al., 2011). The determined parameters and operations are: the environ-mental conditions during the process of primary packag-ing, issuing packaging material, issuing bulk product, blis-ter forming, filling tablets into blisters, testing tablet pres-ence in the blister, text printing on the aluminum lidding foil, blister sealing, embossing batch number and expiry S4 PP 189400Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 399 - 400 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsdate on the blisters, the blister perforation, the blister cut-ting, insertion of proper number of blisters, leaflets fold-ing, pharma code reading on the boxes, pharma code read-ing on the leaflet, embossing batch number and expiry date on the boxes, leaflet presence, weight check, determination of yield. For all parameters and operations potential risks are defined, consequences (severity of consequences, prob-ability of occurrence, the possibility of detection). The as-sessment effort requires that potential product defects from any given packaging operation is defined and graded for severity, frequency and on the ability of the operation and/or an operator to detect the defect (Internal procedure: List of evidence for identification of risk, 2009)Risk evaluation compares the identified and analyzed risk against given risk criteria. The output of a risk assess-ment is estimated as quantitative description of a range of risk. A numerical probability is used. Defect detection is categorized and graded on a 1-to-4 scale to reflect a detec-tion capability of \u201cnone\u201d (unable to detect) to \u201calways\u201d de-tect. For each potential failure, all precautions are reviewed and a detection capability is assigned.  For determinations of severity, frequency and detection, all relevant data is taken into consideration, including maintenance and oper-ation logs, batch (Internal procedure: List of evidence for identification of risk, 2009).ConclusionThe risk of blister packaging process is reduced to an acceptable level. According to the results of the risk as-sessment on blister packaging on the IMA C80/A81 blis-ter packaging line, we can conclude that the blister pack-aging process is with low risk and the process is capable to perform effectively and gives reproducible products with quality that matches with the regulatory specifications and quality attributes.ReferencesGuidance for industry, Q9 Quality Risk Management, June 2006.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration.Internal procedure, List of evidence for identification of risk, 2009.Reich, S., Sanchez, E., Creekmore, R., Murray, K., Hasselbalch, B., Obeng, K., 2011.PQRI Case Study (6): Packaging Line GMP Optimization.

Cyril & Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* msimonoska@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionDementia is characterized by persons` significant cog-nitive decline and interference with everyday life indepen-dency. There are several types of dementia, but Alzheim-er\u2019s disease (AD) is most common form. AD a neurode-generative disease is characterized by decline in memory, language, problem-solving and other cognitive skills that affects a person\u2019s ability to perform everyday activities (Alzheimer\u2019s, 2015). Currently there are only 5 drugs approved for AD treatment and all are targeted towards metabolic disor-ders associated with the disease. Four of them, tacrine, do-nepezil (DON), rivastigmine (RIV) and galantamine (ap-proved in 1993, 1996, 1998 and 2001, respectively) are in group of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEi) and one, memantine (MEM), approved in 2003, is N-methyl-D-as-partate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (Cummings et al., 2014).  Although AD drugs are frequently used for more than 20 years there are evidences about controversies re-lated to their efficacy and clinical significance (Lanct\u00f4t et al., 2009). The aim of the current study was to analyze safety and efficacy of dosage forms of AD most commonly used drugs with focus on meta-analysis as well as to identify trends in AD treatment. Current therapeutic optionsOral solution, hard capsules and transdermal patches with RIV, for treatment of mild to moderate dementia asso-ciated with AD and Parkinson\u2019s disease are present on the market.  Latest Cohran`s collaboration review is address-ing RIV clinical efficacy/safety in treatment longer than 12 weeks (any dose and administration route) in patients with AD dementia compared to placebo as well as compar-ison of RIV patches and capsules given at the manufactur-er\u2019s recommended dose (Birks and Grimley Evans, 2015). Results from the study indicated that RIV use is associat-ed with some benefits on some outcomes (cognitive func-tion, activities of daily living and clinician rated global im-pression) and no differences in behavioural symptoms and quality of life of carers compared to placebo. No difference compared to placebo for withdrawals before the end of the treatment and at least one adverse effect was identified for RIV lower dose (1-4 mg/day), while for higher dose (6-12 mg/day) results favoured placebo. Fewer side effects re-lated to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, effect on decreased appetite and asthenia for 9.5 mg/day patches compared to capsules were identified (Birks and Grimley Evans, 2015). DON for the treatment of mild to moderate AD is ap-proved in form of film coated and dispersible tablets.  Ef-fects of DON (any dose) in mild, moderate or severe de-mentia in AD treatments longer than 1 day compared to placebo were assessed by Birks and Harvey (2006).  Re-sults were similar as for RIV (Birks and Grimley Evans, 2015) with the exception of positive findings for DON ef-fect on behaviour. Dose of 5mg/day DON was found to be more cost-effective as 10 mg/day dose was associated with more adverse effects and only marginally higher effects.Comparison of safety and efficacy of AChEi for AD was done by Birks (2006). Four studies were identified, but only one (DON vs RIV) met criteria for inclusion in meta-analysis. No differences in efficacy were observed, but DON was associated with less adverse effects, particu-larly nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, event of fall and hypertension. However, conducted meta-analysis sug-gested that their tolerability might be match if RIV is care-fully and gradually titrated for more than 3 months (Birks, S4 PP 190402Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 401 - 402 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentations2006).MEM is marketed in form of film-coated tablets for treatment of moderate to severe AD dementia. McShane et al. (2006) meta-analysis was related to efficacy and safe-ty of MEM (any dose and any route of administration) for people with AD, vascular and mixed dementia. Clinically significant reduction of deterioration in patients with mod-erate to severe AD dementia was determined when MEM in dose of 20 mg/day for at least 28 weeks was compared to placebo. In general, MEM was well tolerated with low in-cidence of adverse effects (McShane et al., 2006).  Latest FDA approved drug for treatment of AD de-mentia (in 2014) is Namzaric (memantine hydrochloride extended-release + donepezil hydrochloride). Trends in Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug development Having in mind that we are facing with lack of effi-cacious therapeutic options for prevention and treatment of dementia and specifically for AD and associated behav-ioral and physiological symptoms there is extensive sci-entific research in this field. For ex. search on Scopus da-tabase (www.scopus.com.scopeesprx.elsevier.com) per-formed on 1.11.2015 using key words \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s dis-ease\u201d resulted with 105860 items. Annual analysis pointed to the growing scientific interest for AD research as num-ber of published items continuously increased during the years. First 2 published articles related to AD were found to be in 1912 year and the number was relatively low till 1988 (less than 800 per year). Further on, AD research rap-idly grew with more than 4000 published scientific papers in 2005, thus reaching its maximum in 2014 with >8000 published scientific items (at the time of search for 2015 there were 6417, and 60 for 2016 year). Also, search on www.clinicaltrials.gov.mk carried out on 27.10.2015 re-sulted with total of 1769 AD clinical trials allocated to all continents around the globe. At the time of search 541 clin-ical trials were with status OPEN, mainly in USA, Europe, China and Japan - 231, 175, 67 and 41 respectively. In Eu-rope most of the studies (56.6%) were located in France, followed by United Kingdom (18.3%) and Spain (17.1%). Nearly 30% of active trials were related to drug substanc-es not yet approved for AD. Beside high number of clini-cal trials we have to be held in reserve as for a period of 10 years (2002-2012) 244 AD drugs were in clinical trials, but only one, MEM in 2003, was approved (0.4% succeed rate) (Alzheimer\u2019s, 2015).  It is a fact that development of new drugs for treatment of AD is difficult and compli-cated due to the high costs, relatively long time needed to observe disease progression in AD and blood-brain bar-rier.  Problems associated with blood-brain barrier might be surmounted by innovative therapeutic systems (ITS) for drug targeting and controlled release (liposomes, mi-celles, nanoparticles etc). Namely, utilizing their unique physico-chemical and biopharmaceutical properties drug targeted and controlled release dosage form with modi-fied/improved pharmacokinetics/dynamics might be de-veloped.  Conducted search on Scopus database (accessed on 13.08.2015) retrieved 666 scientific papers (SP) related to micelles, liposomes, solidlipid nanoparticles, nanostruc-tured lipid carriers and nanoparticles as ITS and/or RIV (197 SP), tacrine (124 SP), MEM (189 SP) and DON (156 SP) as drug substances.  However in detail analysis of re-trieved items revealed that only 15 (2.25%) were original research papers, and others were reviews. A vast majority of the original research papers (86.7%) were related to RIV and only 6.7% were related to DON and MEM, each. Li-posomes and micelles as carriers for RIV were studied in 26.7% and 6.7% of the research papers, respectively. On the other hand most of the conducted research (66.7%) was related to nanoparticles, where\u2019s 80% were focused on RIV and 10% on DON and MEM, each. All of them were char-acterized in terms of particle size, drug content/ encapsu-lation efficiency, zeta potential and in vitro dissolution and majority (66.7%) conducted in vivo animal studies. All ob-tained results in the reviewed studies pointed to ITS poten-tial use for AD efficacious treatment.Based on the retrieved data it can be concluded that although ITS for different conditions are already in use for more than 20 years (1989 FDA approved Diprivan\u00ae - surfactant-based nanoformulation of anestetic Propofol) exploration of their potentials for AD treatment is still in its begging\u2019s.ReferencesAlzheimer\u2019s, A., 2015.

After intravenous administration blood is the first biolog-ical environment nanoparticles are exposed to, compris-ing a pool of several thousand proteins in different con-centrations (Monopoli et al., 2011). Plasma proteins tend to adsorb on the naoparticle surface forming so-called pro-tein corona, which governs the nano-bio interactions and determines nanoparticles fate following their administra-tion. Modified biological identity of nanoparticles will af-fect the physiological response including their circulation time, agglomeration, transport, accumulation, internaliza-tion and toxicity.Nanoparticle characteristics (size, shape, surface charge, surface functional groups and hydrophilicity/hy-drophobicity), the nature of physiological environment (blood, intestinal fluid, cytoplasm) and the exposure time play a key role in the process of protein corona formation (Masoud et al., 2013). The rate of adsorption/desorption of different proteins, competitive binding, steric stabiliza-tion induced by adsorbed polymers and surfactants as well as the protein composition of body fluids lead to dynamic changes of the protein corona. In the initial phase, usually the most abundant plasma proteins, such as albumin, are adsorbed at the surface of in-travenously administered nanoparticles. In time, albumin can be replaced by proteins with higher binding affinity towards NP surface, since the protein corona composition continuously exchange (Vroman effect). It is worth men-tioning that there is a possibility for structural and func-tional changes of proteins that interact with the nanopar-ticle surface, which could lead to activation of molecu-lar mechanisms resulting in certain pathogenesis (Nel et al., 2009). Therefore, a detailed protein corona character-ization is crucial for biocompatibility assessment of the nanoparticulate drug delivery system.For this purpose, in this study we conducted compara-tive protein corona composition analysis of three different polymeric nanoparticles at several time intervals.Materials and methodsPoly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-Poly(ethylene glycol)-b-Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) with two different molecular weights (Mw~148000Da and Mw~22000Da) and Poly(DL-lactide-co-caprolactone) (P(DLLACL copolymer, LA:CL 10:90, Mw 77799 Da) were purchased from AkinaInc, USA. Acrylamide-biacryl-amide 37.5:1, 30% solution, Electrophoresis running buf-fer, Laemmli buffer and Comassie brilliant blue were ob-tained from Bio-Rad, USA. Tris (hydroxymethyl) amino-methane (TRIS) base, Sodium dodecyl sulphate and Amo-niumpersulphate were acquired from Sigma Aldrich, USA, while N,N,N\u2019,N\u2019-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) was purchased from MerckMilipore, Germany. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as re-ceived.Nanoparticle preparationThree types of nanoparticles (NP1, NP2 and NP3) were prepared by nanoprecipitation method as described before (Dimchevska et al., 2015; Koliqi et al., 2016). Following copolymers were used for this purpose: PLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw~148000Da), PLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw~22000Da) and P(DLLACL), respectively.S4 PP 191404Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 403 - 404 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsProtein corona evaluationSemi-quantitative protein corona evaluation was per-formed using SDS-PAGE \u2013 sodium dodecyl sulphate poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. 4% stacking gel and 10% resolving gel were used to estimate the protein corona com-position of nanoparticles. At first, all NPs (1mg/mL) were incubated with 50% of human plasma at 37 \u00b0C for three dif-ferent time periods (30min, 1h and 4h) in a water bath at stirring rate of 100 oscillations/min (Haake, Denmark). Af-ter the incubation, nanoparticles were pelleted by centrifu-gation (18000xg, 30 min at 4 \u00b0C) and the plasma was dis-carded. The samples were washed twice with 1.5 mL PBS and the supernatant was removed. 25 \u00b5L of Laemmli sam-ple buffer containing 5% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol was then add-ed to each sample.  Samples were vortexed for 30s and heat-ed at 95 \u00b0C for 5min in order to provide desorption and de-naturation of adsorbed proteins. NPs were allowed to cool down at RT and then 5\u00b5L of each sample were loaded into the stacking gel placed on a vertical system (Mini Protean Cell, BioRad, USA). Gels were run for 60-90 min at 110 mV. After the protein separation the gels were removed, im-mersed in a 0.1% Coomassie blue solution and left to stand for 16h. The next day, each gel was washed with destaining solution (40% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid and 50% deionized water) in four cycles. Pictures were acquired on white background using VersaDoc, Bio-Rad, USA. Densi-tometric analysis of proteins was performed using Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software, Bio-Rad, USA.Results and discussionTime-resolved protein evaluation confirmed the dy-namic character of protein corona for all types of investi-gated nanoparticles. The results revealed a presence of an intense band around 66 kDa at each time point for all types of NPs, which corresponds to the molecular weight of al-bumin. Since albumin is the most abundant plasma protein with modular structural organization, high molecular flex-ibility and variety of binding sites on its surface, mutual non-specific interactions with the NPs were promoted, es-pecially in the early time points of the experiment.Further, we have noticed that different binding pat-terns for different NPs over time were displayed, probably due to their specific surface properties. Also, various com-position of protein corona for each type of NPs was ob-served at the later time periods (1h and 4h) which corre-spond to protein corona dynamic nature and concomitant association/dissociation of diverse protein molecules dur-ing time. The results for longer incubation periods have shown that albumin was progressively replaced by other proteins with higher affinity and increased binding spec-ificity to the NP surfaces, regardless of their plasma con-centration. Proteins with molecular weights of 43 kDa, 41 kDa, 32 kDa and 25 kDa have gradually replaced the ini-tially adsorbed albumin (66 kDa) as well as proteins with Mw of 55 kDa and 50 kDa at the surface of NP1 and NP2. Additionally, one characteristic band at 8 0kDa was ob-served at the later time points for NP2 which could not be observed for NP1. Protein corona composition of NP3 for-mulation was significantly different compared to NP1 and NP2, probably due to the higher hydrophobicity of the NP core. Specific proteins adsorbed onto the NP3 surface were those with Mw of 28 kDa, 36 kDa, 46 kDa, including one high molecular weight protein (Mw 185 kDa). Our results correspond to the literature data for protein adsorption upon polymer NP surfaces. Namely, in the ear-ly time points of the experiment, albumin and fibrinogen were dominant components of the NP protein corona. Lat-er on, significant differences appeared among the adsorbed imunoglobulins upon the surfaces of various NPs and ad-ditionally apolipoproteins came to be a significant portion of the total protein quantity.ConclusionDisplacement of proteins over time was confirmed for all evaluated types of NPs. It was shown that abundant pro-teins such as albumin and fibrinogen may initially occupy the NP surface and get subsequently replaced by other pro-teins having higher binding affinity like apolipoproteins.Different protein binding patterns lead to altered bio-logical identity of NPs that will affect their in vivo behav-ior including their biodistribution, cell internalization, tox-icity and efficacy.ReferencesDimchevska, S., Geskovski, N., Koliqi, R., Gomez Vallejo, V., Szczupak, B., Hristov, D.R., Errasti Lopez, M., San Sebastian, E., Monopoli, M.P., Llop, J., Goracinova, K., 2015.

Cyril and Methodius\u201d, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* magl@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionProlonged-release oral dosage forms offer more advantag-es over a conventional dosage form of the same drug like sus-tained blood levels and better patients compliance, smaller dos-age unit or higher dosage per unit and economical to manufac-ture (Hanna et al., 1987). The active agent can now be delivered and made bioavailable in a sustained and well-controlled man-ner up to a desired period of time. The matrix system is com-monly used for manufacturing prolonged-release dosage forms. Bio-functional polymers have pharmaceutical interest in recent years and are widely used for formulation of modified release dosage forms (Meidan and Khan, 2007). Cellulose ethers are commonly employed as the hydrophilic, swellable and erodible matrix polymers for orally administered types of prolonged-re-lease systems (Ferrero Rodriguez et al., 2000). As water insol-uble excipients, ethylcellulose polymers (Ethocel) can effec-tively control the release of an active ingredient by modifying the size and length of diffusion path. By varying the type and amount of the insoluble excipient ratio and the particle size, a wide variety of release rate patterns can be achieved.The aim of the present study was to develop prolonged-release matrix tablets for water-soluble drug using hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose (Methocel) and Ethocel in order to re-duce dosing frequency, to lesser the side effects and to im-prove patient compliance.Materials and methodsMaterialsWater-soluble compound (API) was used as a model drug (solubility 10.2 mg/ml, pKa 10.26 and 9.12, Mw 473.49 g/mol, BCS Class III). The other excipients were: Methocel K100M (Colorcon, EU), Ethocel 7cPs FP (Colorcon, EU), Kollidon K90 (BASF, Germany), Avicel PH 112 (FMC Bio-polymer, USA), Aerosil 200 (Evonik, Germany) and Magne-sium stearate (Mg S) (Carsco GE, Italy). All the other chemi-cals used were of analytical grade.Preparation of matrix tablets by wet granulation techniqueThe tablets were prepared by wet granulation technique. The API and other excipients were accurately weighed and mixed in laboratory mixer granulator (Diosna Dierks & S\u00f6hne GmbH, Germany). The mass ratio of API:Methocel K100M:Avicel112:Mg S was 7.56:29.04: 25.72:14.52:1 for sample 1 and API:MethocelK100M:Ethocel:Avicel 112:Mg S = 7.56:14.52: 14.52:29.04:1 for sample 2, respectively.Kollidon K90 (5% sol. in alcohol 99%) was used as gran-ulation fluid. The wet mass was passed through #6 mesh and granules were oven dried until a moisture content of 1-3% was achieved. Dried granules were further passed through #230 mesh. The granules were lubricated and compressed into round shaped (7.0 mm) tablets using 4-station rotary compres-sion machine (Korsch XL 100, Korsch AG, Germany) with compression forces 3.8 kN and  8.3 kN (sample 1a,1b and 2, accordingly). Each tablet contained 15 mg of API in 150 mg tablet core weight. The tablets were evaluated for appearance, diameter, thickness and hardness. Characterization of the final blends Bulk density was determined by the following formula: Bulk density =Ws/Vs; where Ws is sample weight and Vs is the sample volume (Ph. Eur. 8.7).Tape density is the indirect measurement of flow, mixing and tableting properties of powder. Tapped density was deter-mined by Ph. Eur. 8.7 method: tablet blend was filled in 100 ml graduated cylinder of tap density tester which was operated for fixed number of taps until the powder bed volume has reached S4 PP 192406Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 405 - 406 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsa minimum, thus was calculated by formula: Tapped density = Weight of mixture/volume of mixture after 100 tapings.Compressibility index of the final blends was determined by Carr\u2019s compressibility (%) = Df - Do/Df; where Df is the bulk density and Do is the tapped density (Ph. Eur. 8.7).Hausner\u2019s ratio or index of flowability was calculated by the formula: Hausner\u2019s ratio=V1/V2; where V1 is the volume before taping and V2 is the volume after taping (Ph. Eur. 8.7).Angle of repose was determined using funnel method. Tablet blend were poured from funnel, that can be raised ver-tically until a maximum cone height h was obtained diameter heap D, was measured (Ph. Eur. 8.7). The angle of repose was measured using Granulate flow tester (Erweka GmbH, Ger-many).Loss on drying is the loss of mass expressed as per cent m/m (Ph. Eur. 8.7). It was measured by drying the substance to constant mass using Moisture Analyzer (Mettler Toledo Ex-cellence HS 153, US). Physical characterization of the prepared tablets10 tablets were used to study the weight variation us-ing electronic balance (Sartorius Secura 224-1CU, Sartorius AG,Germany). The diameter, thickness and tablet hardness was deter-mined for ten tablets using ErwekaTablet Hardness Tester Type TBH 425 TD (Erweka GmbH, Germany).In vitro drug release studiesDissolution testing was conducted in 900 ml of phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (USP apparatus I, basket, speed 100 rpm) at 37\u00b10.5 \u00b0C. A 5 ml of the dissolution medium was withdrawn at regular tome intervals (after 2, 4, 10 and 12 h). The vol-ume of dissolution medium was adjusted by replacing each 5 ml aliquot withdrawn with 5 ml of fresh dissolution medium. Quantity of released API was determined by previously vali-dated HPLC method.Results and discussionThe bulk density of sample 1 and sample 2 were 0.272 and 0.360 g/ml respectively, while tapped density values were 0.331 and 0.439 g/ml. Compressibility index of sample 1 and sample 2 were 18 and 19%, while Hausner\u2019s ratio values were 1.22 and 1.21 correspondingly, which is an indication of fair flow properties. Angle of repose of the final blends was 41.2\u00b0 for sample 1 and 40.3\u00b0 for sample 2. LOD was found to be 2.40% for sam-ple1 and 2.55% for sample2 indicating that both of the final blends had moisture content up to acceptable limit which was good for compression to make uniform matrices. All tablets were smooth and elegant in appearance. Tablet weight variations for both samples prepared in this study were found to be less than 1%. Sample 1a had diameter of 7.00 mm; thickness 4.23 mm and hardness 5.01 kP (at compression force 3.8 kN). Sample 1b had diameter of 6.97 mm; thick-ness 3.37 mm and hardness 14.29 kP (at compression force 8.2 kN). Sample 2 had diameter of 6.97 mm; thickness 3.32 mm and hardness 12.12 kP (at compression force 8.2 kN).Polymers belonging to hydrophilic matrix systems, when exposed to an aqueous medium, do not disintegrate, but im-mediately after hydration form a highly viscous gelatinous surface barrier which control the liquid penetration into the center of the matrix system as well as drug release from the dosage form (Talukder et al., 1996). Sample 1a released 57.63, 71.96 and 100.78% after 2, 4 and 10 h, respectively. In the same investigated period, sample 1b released 50.44, 69.88 and 100.55%, indicating that there is no significant difference in the drug release from the Methocel matrices compresses at different compression forces. It can be implied that the porosity and/or tortuosity of the prepared tab-lets after their hydration were not affected by an increase in tablet hardness from 3.8 kN and 8.2 kN. Obtained results in this work were in accordance with the literature data (Ravi et al., 2008).Sample 2 released the 30.75, 50.78, 77.49 and 89.13% after 2, 4, 10 and 12 h, indicating that the fine Ethocel parti-cles contributed to retard the drug release from the matrices. The reduction in release rates with addition of Ethocel was perhaps due to slow hydration of the matrix, based upon the hydrophobic character of Ethocel. The insoluble particles of Ethocel were probably acting as barrier to drug release in the gel layer of Methocel.ConclusionBased on these results it can be concluded that the com-bination of Methocel and Ethocel could be a successful solu-tion in modifying the release of water-soluble drug form ma-trix system tablets.

Beograd, Prahovska 3, 11000 Beograd, Republic of Serbia* vdinic@alkaloid.co.rsIntroductionStatistical process control (SPC) provides a statistical approach for evaluating the process of production and for improving the quality of the process through better under-standing. SPC is a process orientated data driven method to improve processes to deliver day after day results that have added value for the customer. In particular this meth-od will help tocontinuously improve processes and reduce variability, describe and control the stability of process-es, monitor and prove excellence of processes, alert before any batch is violating specifications, and document process understanding for regulatory agencies (Sven, 2016).When SPC is effectively implemented within a com-pany, benefits can be derived through a reduced cost of manufacture, improved quality, fewer troubleshooting cri-ses, and improved relationships with customers (Thomas et al., 2006).In this paper the application of SPC in the process of packaging of tablets in the pharmaceutical industry is shown. As a key process indicator (KPI) for the process of packaging the yield of the final product is observed. As a critical quality attribute an assay of tablets in the final prod-uct is observed. For SPC studies, individual values - Con-trol Charts and Moving Ranges-control charts were con-structed and Process capability indexes were calculated in order to verify if the process is under control.Materials and methodsMaterials used were as follows: Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg (Alkaloid A.D., Skopje, Macedonia), PVC foil 250 \u03bcm x 118 mm (Lamp East d.o.o., Serbia), alu-minum foil Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg (Lamp East d.o.o., Serbia), leaflet Amlodipin tablets 5 mg and 10 mg (Zapisd.o.o., Serbia), Carton boxes Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x30 (Grafolikd.o.o., Serbia). Equipment used was: blister packaging machine IMA TR100LT (IMA S.p.a. Italy), data printing line Videojet 1210 + Etipack Clear (Videojet Technologies Itc, USA, Etipack, S.p.a., Italy), HPLC Thermo Scientific DIONEX UltiMate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) STA-TISTICA 8, StatSoft Inc., USA. Data for the yield of the blister packaging process were obtained as a ratio of produced number of packages of final product Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x 30 and planned number of packages of each batch, expressed as a percentage.The content of amlodipine in Amlodipin Alkaloid tab-lets 5 mg was analyzed according to the Ph. EUR. 8 mono-graph for Amlodipine besylate with HPLC method (EP 2.2.29).Control charts were generated by STATISTICA soft-ware, after the following steps were performed:- The data for yield and content of Amlodipine were obtained for all batches of Amlodipin Al-kaloid tablets 5 mg x30 that were manufactured in 2015;- The overall mean and average were calculated;- Moving ranges were calculated;- Process standard deviations for the process and moving ranges were calculated;- Control limits for individual values (UCL and LCL) and moving ranges (UCLMR) were cal-culated (Bakker et al., 2008).Process capability indexes can be used as a tool that will show how often the process fits into the specification limits. There are two most common used process capabili-ty indexes: Cp and Cpk.S4 PP 193408Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 407 - 408 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsThe Cp-value is the relation of the range of the specifi-cation to the range of the process and it doesn\u2019t show if the process is within the specification limits. The Cpk-value is the relation of the range of the spec-ification to the mean value to the range of the process. If the value is below 1.0 there are values outside specifica-tion. If the value is exactly 0 half of the values are outside specification. All process should have Cpk>1.33 to be sure that the process is stable and always in the desired specifi-cation limits.For the purpose of the study Cpk indexes for the yield of the packaging process and for the content of amlodipine in the finished product Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x 30 were calculated.Results and discussionThe new approach of the pharmaceutical industry was developed after the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) announced initiative in August 2002, Pharmaceutical Cur-rent Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) for the 21st Century.  The modern approach of the pharmaceutical in-dustry has a basis in good process and product understand-ing. Quality should be built in each phase of the product lifecycle.As a result of this approach the use of different tools that will help to gain better knowledge for the process is in-creased in the last 15 years. These tools can be used in all stages of the lifecycle of the drug product. During the man-ufacturing of the drug products the most common tools that might help in the understanding of the process are: quali-ty risk management, corrective and preventive action, pro-cess capability studies, Six Sigma and control charts.Individual values control charts and moving ranges control charts should be always evaluated together in order to have a complete picture of the process. After the con-trol charts were generated it was concluded that all of the Western Electric statistical rules were satisfied (Bonnie et al., 1956): 1. One point outside of the control limits (3 \u03c3);2. Two points out of 3 are more than 2 \u03c3 from the cen-tre line;3. Four points out of 5 are more than 1 \u03c3 from the cen-tre line;4. Eight points on one side of the center linefor both control charts: yield and assay of amlodipine in the finished product Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x 30. It was shown on data obtained from 83 produced batch-es during 2015, that the process of packaging of Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 30 x 5 mg is under statistical control and there is no special cause variability. Also the Cpk indexes values showed that the process is always capable to give high yield and the active substance content is always with-in specified limits.The values for the yield and assay of amlodipine in the finished product Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x 30, ob-tained from the last 30 batches were used to calculate the control limits for continual process verification. The pack-aging process of all batches that have been produced from 01.2016 onwards will be followed by control charts with the new established control limits.ConclusionIn the pharmaceutical industry SPC can be used for better understanding of the process, to analyze existing re-sults for Annual Product Review and as a tool for continu-ous process verification. Different kind of data can be an-alyzed as per example: in-process control data (tablet\u2019s weight, tablet\u2019s height), quality control data (dissolution, content of active substance, and content of impurities) and process performance data (yield). It can be said that individual value-control charts, moving ranges-control charts and process capability in-dexes are very simple but valuable tools for process under-standing and for following the quality of the product con-tinuously.ReferencesAmer, G., 2009.

Ascorbic acid is susceptible to oxidative degradation and, therefore, it requires significant physico-chemical and stability considerations in its formulations (Odeniyi and Jaiyeoba, 2007).The purpose of this study was to investigate the vari-ability in the physical stability properties of ascorbic acid 95% granules induced by wet granulation process of ascor-bic acid in order to produce ascorbic acid 95% granules used as product which will take place in further processing of conventional tablets.Materials and methodsDifferent batches from ascorbic acid 95% granules containing ascorbic acid (95.0% w/w) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) type 2910 (50 mPas) (5.0% w/w) were prepared by wet granulation technique. Based on be-fore gained experience and literature reference data, con-centration of purified water used as granulation aid, pro-cess parameters of drying process and sieves/screen size for dry granulate were varied, in order to evaluate the role and check which of this variables is/are most important from the aspect of colour stability of ascorbic acid 95% granules. All manufactured batches from ascorbic acid 95% granulate were stored in stability testing chambers with defined conditions for temperature (40 \u02daC) and hu-midity (75% RH) in open Petri dishes for 15 days and were analysed on zero, fifth and fifteenth day. Physical charac-terization of granules was conducted using a range of ex-perimental methods.All excipients used in the present study are approved for use in the pharmaceutical industry. Ascorbic acid 95% granules were produced by using ascorbic acid (DSM), hy-droxypropyl methylcellulose type 2910 \u2013 HPMC E 5 LV (Methocel, Colorcon, UK). All methods were performed according to Good Man-ufacturing Practices (GMP.) Process parameters: mixing time, mixing speed and chopper speed of the high shear mixer granulator (Dios-na 4L, Diosna, Germany) used during wet granulation pro-cess were same for all laboratory trials. Mixing of pre-blend of ascorbic acid (475.0 g) and HPMC E 5 LV (50 g) - mixing time: 3 min, mixing speed: 250 rpm, chopper speed: 1000 rpm. Wet granulation phase was separated in two phases granulation I/II (granulation time: 3 min /6 min, granulation speed: 150 rpm/200 rpm, chopper speed: 1000 rpm/1000 rpm).Concentration of water purified used as granulation aid during process of wet granulation was varied in different batches as 3.0% w/w, 3.5% w/w and 4.0% w/w.S4 PP 194410Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 409 - 410 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsDrying process of granules were made in fluid bed dri-er (Huttling, Germany), by varying of drying parameter in different batches as inlet air temperature 60 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C. As end point determination for drying phase was used loss on drying (LOD) of granules to be maximum 0.5%. In accordance with the varied drying parameters for inlet air temperature, drying time varied from 7 min to 35 min for the drying process. Variations on drying process parameters were made on ascorbic acid 95% granules pro-duced with 4.0% w/w water purified as granulation aid, be-cause based on before gained experience, 4.0% w/w water purified is determined as optimal concentration of granula-tion aid for obtaining good granulate with acceptable qual-ity parameters.Prepared dry granules from all batches were separate in two equal parts and were passed through laboratory sieve equipment (QuadroComil, Quadro, Canada) under differ-ent sieve size. First part of granules were sieved through sieve with pore size 0.813 mm and the other part from the sieve with pore size 0.610 mm in order to obtained gran-ules with different particle size distribution (PSD).All manufactured batches of ascorbic acid 95% gran-ules with all variables described above were placed sepa-rately in open Petri dish in stability chambers with defined conditions for temperature (40 \u00b0C) and humidity (75% RH) and were stored for fifteen days.Physical and chemical characterization of granules were analysed on zero, fifth and fifteenth day by various experimental methods: Fourier Transform Infrared spec-troscopy (FTIR, Varian 660, Australia), Differential Scan-ning Calorimetry (DSC, Netzsch 204F1 Phoenix, Germa-ny), appearance, colour\u2013 organoleptic examination, bulk density and tapped density (Erweka SVM 102, Erweka, Germany), flow characteristics, angle of repose (\u00b0) (Erwe-ka granulate flow tester GTB, Erweka, Germany), loss on drying (Mettler Toledo HG 63, Mettler Toledo, Switzer-land) and optical microscopy (Morphologi G3S, Malvern, UK).Results and discussionFrom the results obtained in this study it can be eas-ily seen that it is most challenging scientific task  to sep-arate just one parameter as responsible for physical (co-lour) stability issue of ascorbic acid 95% granules. From the produced batches with different variables it is more than obvious that humidity (concentration of granulation aid 4.0% water purified) and time spent under high humid-ity (concentration of granulation aid 4.0% water purified and dried with 30 \u00b0C inlet air temperature which take about 37 min for drying process) are the most responsible factor for changing the colour of ascorbic acid 95% granules and also PSD of the granules plays huge role in colour stabil-ity because it was noticed that granules with bigger gran-ules (their fraction with bigger granule) change their colour more drastically than the granules with smaller fraction. It is important to note that even we have made physical characterization by using range of experimental techniques with none of them except organoleptic and visual examina-tion, changes can\u2019t be detected. On the other side by visu-al examination it can be easily seen that there is big colour difference among the granules. ConclusionResults present in this study indicates that production of ascorbic acid 95% granules due to the nature of active substance is very complex process and as most important factors which affect physical stability of granulate, humid-ity and temperature can be pointed.ReferencesHeber, D., 2007.PDR for Herbal Medicines 4th edition.

It is a disease very difficult to treat, with very little change in the treat-ment over the last several decades. So, even though with limited efficacy, mechanical plaque biofilm disruption is still at the mainstream of periodontal therapy with the ad-dition of several treatment modalities (systemic antibiot-ics, topical antimicrobials, laser therapy etc.) but only as adjunct to scaling and root planning. However, optimism for discovery of the treatments with improved efficacy is restored due to continuous research efforts especially dur-ing the last two decades, and revised as well as upgrad-ed understanding of the ethyology, pathogenesis and com-plexity of this disease. Unquestionably, understanding of the complex microbial community, its virulence and the impact upon the host cells response as well as the impor-tance of the host inflammatory-immune response to intra-oral plaque for the disease development and progression creates new perspectives in management of periodontitis. Basically, novel research data clarified that the disease out-come depends upon the host response towards the complex dysbiotic oral microbial community (Yucel, 2015). Addi-tionally, it may be modified by genetic and different en-vironmental factors. Consequently, host modulation ther-apies are being proposed (Deshmukl et al., 2011) in order to tackle excessive host inflammatory reaction and target-ing of various aspects of the inflammation pathways (lev-els of enzymes, cytokines, prostanoids, as well modulation of osteoclast). Host modulating agents include non-steroi-dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), sub antimicrobi-al dose doxycycline as well as topical doxycycline, sys-temic bisphosphonates, host modulating agents antagoniz-ing pro-inflammatory cytokines, selective inhibitors of ni-tric oxide synthase, inhibitors targeting the signaling path-ways like c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor; Extra-cellular-Signal-Regulated Kinases (ERK) inhibitor; NF\u03baB inhibitor; JK3 inhibitor etc.Tetracycline apart from its an-timicrobial property, when used in sub-antimicrobial doses works as anti-inflammatory agent and has capability of in-hibiting the activities of neutrophils, osteoclasts, MMP 8, thereby inhibiting tissue and bone destruction. However, systemic therapy and conventional polymer implants with Doxycycline hyclate could not supply sufficient concentra-tion of the active substance at the site of action for a pro-longed period of time in order to provide efficient therapy. Smart bioadhesive micro and nano drug delivery systems with controlled release of the active substance will great-ly contribute to improved therapeutic efficacy, considering their ability to interact with the permeable junctional epi-thelium as well as elements of inflammation like macro-phages, dendritic cells etc, at the same time allocating high concentration of Doxycycline in the vicinity and/or at the site of the inflammation.Therefore, the main objective of this study is develop-ment and evaluation of mucoadhesive controlled release chitosan microspheres for local treatment of periodontal disease, with a size span from 1-10 \u03bcm, loaded with Dox-ycycline hyclate.S4 PP 195412Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 411 - 412 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsMaterials and methodsMaterialsDoxycycline hyclate was obtained form Kunshau Chemical, China, chitosan with degree of deacetylation 75-85%, sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), sodium citrate, 2-methyl-2-propanol and calcium citrate were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Germany and tetrabutilammponium hydrogen sulphate was purshased from Merck Millipore, Germany.MethodsMicroparticles were produced by spray drying meth-od (Buchi Mini Spray dryer B-290, Switzerland) with these conditions: inlet temperature 175 \u02daC, aspiration 70%, pump flow 2% and air flow of 600 Nl/h. The colloidal so-lutions were prepared by ionotropic gelation method, with gradual addition of the cross-linking agent solutions (10 ml) to the solutions of polymers (1% chitosan sol.) and ac-tive ingredient (50 mg) (magnetic stirrer Variomag, Multi-point HP 15, Germany). Particle size and the swelling in-dex were determined with laser difractometry (Mastersiz-er 2000, Malvern Instr., Ltd, UK) using cell Hydro 2000S, (Malvern Instr., Ltd, UK). The swelling degree was mea-sured in diluted 1:2 phosphate buffer pH 7.0 (USP) with similar ionic strength of saliva. Drug release rate was fol-lowed in a suspension of microparticles in diluted 1:2 phos-phate buffer pH 7.0 (USP), placed in closed tubes in hori-zontal shaker at 37 \u00b0C, (Unitronic OR, Selecta, Barcelona, Spain). The concentration of released doxycycline hyclate in different time intervals as well as drug content and effi-cacy of encapsulation were determined using HPLC meth-od, column Phenomenex\u00ae 250-4.6 mm, PolymerX 5\u03bcm RP-1 100A (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), mobile phase of 2-methyl-2-propanol, buffer pH 8.0 R (Ph.Eur.), tetrabutilammponium hydrogen sulphate, and diluted solu-tions of sodium hydroxide and sodium edetate.Results and discussionDoxycycline loaded microparticles were prepared by TPP ionic cross-linking combined with spray drying meth-od. Since the cross-linking of chitosan depends on the availability of the cationic sites and the negatively charged TPP species, the crosslinking process was carried out at pH 4.5, where chitosan as a polycation (pKa 6.3) will present \u2013NH+3 sites and mostly phosphoric ions from TPP will be generated (Desai & Park, 2004). Different concentrations of the TPP cross-linking solutions (formulation A - 0.1% TPP; B - 0.5%; C - 0.75%; D - 1%) were used in order to evaluate their influence upon the physico-chemical prop-erties of the chitosan microparticles like, particle size and particle size distribution, yield, efficacy of incorporation, drug content and dissolution rate. The results pointed that at higher TPP concentration larger particles were produced with a presence of aggre-gates after the spray drying process. Mean particle sizes were 5.0 \u03bcm; 3.3 \u03bcm; 7.5 \u03bcm and 50 \u03bcm for series A, B, C and D, respectively. Span factor gradually increased with increasing concentrations of TPP solution, confirming the aggregation in series prepared using 0.75% (span = 2.9) and 1% (span = 4.8) TPP cross-linking solution. Yield and efficacy of encapsulation were slightly increased for mi-croparticles prepared using 0.75% and 1% TPP. The dis-solution studies showed that although dissolution rate de-creased with increasing TPP concentrations, the rate reduc-tion was not significant and it may have resulted from the particle size difference and the differences in the surface area exposed to the dissolution medium (formulation B - Dissolution results at T 1h, 3h, 5h were 40%, 60% and 90 cum.% compared to formulation C Dissolution rate results of 35, 50 and 80 cum.% at T 1h, 3h, 5h, respectively).ConclusionThe present study investigated the influence of differ-ent concentration of the cross-linking agent on the physico-chemical properties of the spray dried chitosan micropar-ticles. It was found that the TPP concentration influenced the particle size, particle size distribution, yield, drug load-ing and efficacy of encapsulation, swelling index as well as the dissolution rate of Doxycyline hyclate. Also, higher concentration of TPP resulted in production of larger parti-cles with very broad particle size distribution and substan-tial formation of aggregates with increasing concentrations of the cross-linker.ReferencesYucel, O.O., 2015.

AleksandarMakedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* bstefanova@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionIt may seem obvious to state that a new product should be adequately defined before anyserious product develop-ment is undertaken. In many cases, the value of the design phase is often underestimated in the rush to start develop-ment and get products to the market quickly.This can result in much wasted time and valuable re-sources. Since tablets and capsules account for approx-imately 70% of pharmaceutical preparations, an inves-tigation into the solid-state properties of candidate drugs is an important task to be undertaken during preformula-tion (Wells, 1988). Generally speaking, when dealing with high strength solid dosage forms, this formulation will be more susceptible to any drug substance variability. Howev-er, other studies are also important since, for example, the same chemical compound can have different crystal struc-tures (polymorphs), external shapes (habits), and hence different flow and compression properties.Preformulation is the initial phase in the development of pharmaceutical products. Suitable preformulation will inevitably result in obtaining simple and elegant formula-tion and successful dosage form from a commercial aspect.The performance of a solid dosage form is dependent on the physicochemical properties of the active ingredient and the excipients.Preformulation is a critical phase in drug development where the physicochemical profiling of the active pharma-ceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients are determined and prototype formulations are made. Selection of stable polymorph and solid-state compat-ibility studies of the compounds proposed for development of new pharmaceutical formulations are essential in the ini-tial stage of formulation in order to identify possible in-compatibilities that may affect the stability of the finished product (Gibson, 2004). A wide variety of methodologies that exist make it possible for the preformulation scientist to effectively study whatever needs.The aim of this study was to choose the most stabile polymorph as well as to investigate possible solid-state in-teractions between API of BCS class II and excipients pro-posed for development of film-coated tablets, based on the changes in the infrared spectra of the both polymorphs and induced changes in the infrared spectra of the stressed bi-nary mixtures compared to the infrared spectra of initial bi-nary mixture, as consequence of possible solid-state chem-ical reaction. Additionally, differential scanning calorim-etry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to distinguish between the pseudopolymorphs of the studied API. Materials and methodsMaterials used are: anhydrous pseudopolymorph of BCS class II active compound, monohydrate pseudopoly-morph of BCS class II active compound, mannitol, dical-cium phosphate, povidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, low-substituted, sodium stearyl fumarate, cellulose, microcrys-talline, partially pre-gelatinazed maize starch and sodium lauryl sulfate.Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has proved to be suitable technique for these trials. The FT-IR spectra were recorded using ATR method, in the 4000\u2013550 cm-1 region, on Varian 660 FT-IR spectrometer (Vari-an, Australia) (resolution 4 cm-1, 16 scans per spectrum). Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectra were obtained by MIRAcleZnSe ATR module (PIKE technologies) with S4 PP 196414Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 413 - 414 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationslow pressure micrometer clamp.FT-IR spectra of the binary mixtures were recorded initially and then the same samples were placed in the sta-bility chambers under various conditions (40 \u00b0C/75% RH, 25 \u00b0C/60% RH).Weighed samples of 2-3 mg of the studied API (mono-hydrate and anhydrous form) were scanned in aluminum pans with a perforated lid at speed of 10 K/min from room temperature to 260 \u00b0C. All of the samples were analyzed in dry nitrogen atmosphere using a Netzsch DSC 204F1 Phoenix instrument (Netzsch, Germany). The TGA curves were recorded in the 25\u2013400 \u00b0C range, on a Netzsch TG 209 F1 Iris analyzer (Netzsch, Germany) using aluminum oxide pans.   Results and discussionResults showed spontaneous transition of API from anhydrous to monohydrate form. Significant difference between these pseudopolymorphs was shown in data ob-tained by Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Thermo-gravimetric analysis. In the TG curves of monohydrate and anhydrous forms losses of mass of 5.11% and 1.27%, re-spectively was observed which is in accordance with the-oretical value for monohydrate and anhydrous form. The melting endothermic peak at around 253 \u00b0C (with decom-position) in the both DSC curves, and continuous evapo-ration of water in the DSC curve of the monohydrate form was observed. These observations are in good agreement with the studied pseudopolymorphic forms. Stability of the molecule of the monohydratepseudopolymorph was the main reason this polymorph to be chosen as more suitable for the development of film-coated tablet formulation.Careful inspection of the obtained spectra of the pure API (fresh and stressed) and fresh and stressed binary mix-tures, leads to conclusion that no changes in the position and shape of bands in regards to the spectrum of the ini-tial sample are observable. This confirms that the applied stress conditions do not affect the overall appearance of the FT-IR spectra of the API. Therefore, the characteris-tic vibrational bands from API as well, can be used as rel-evant spectroscopic markers in order to assess the solid-state stability between APIs in the presence of the stud-ied excipients. Based on the comparison of the FT-IR spec-tra of the initial and stressed binary mixtures it can be con-cluded that after exposure on accelerated temperature and humidity levels during the screening period, there is no sig-nificant change in the FT-IR spectra of the binary mixtures of API and described excipients in comparison to the cor-responding FT-IR spectra of the freshly prepared samples. Minor spectral changes, in the binary mixture with po-vidone stored at higher temperature/moisture levels were observed at 1660 cm-1 probably due to the higher presence of moisture and hygroscopic nature of the excipients. For this purpose binary mixture with povidone in formulation ratio was prepared and tested by the same procedure as pre-viously described. In this binary mixture there were no sig-nificant changes in the FT-IR spectra.ConclusionResults showed spontaneous transition of API from anhydrous to monohydrate form. Stability of the molecule of the monohydrate pseudopolymorph was the main reason this polymorph to be chosen as more suitable for the devel-opment of film-coated tablet formulation.The dedicated FT-IR spectroscopy of the binary mix-tures between API and the proposed excipients clear-ly demonstrated the solid-state compatibility of the API and the described excipients. The conclusion was derived based on the absence of significant changes in the FT-IR spectra of the stressed binary mixtures in comparison with the corresponding data obtained from the freshly prepared binary mixtures and the starting materials.

This formulation is indicated for treatment of mild to moderate pain and to ex-press the analgesic effect faster.It is important to note that the film is not functional, and the presented data are related to the tablet core.The purpose of our study was to examine the influence of some formulation factors, such as particle size of the API, disin-tegrant type and concentration (Bolhuiset al., 1994), mass of tablet core and concentration of starch (starch 1500/ par-tially pre-gelatinized Maize starch) (Cunningham, 1999) on the dissolution profile of the API.Materials and methodsAPI, Prosolv HD 90(Silicified microcrystalline cel-lulose) was supplied from JRS Pharma Rosenberg, Ger-many, Starch 1500 (partially pre-gelatinized Maize starch) was supplied from Colorcon, Indianapolis USA, Kollidon VA 64 (Copovidone) was supplied from  BASF, Ludwig-shaften, Germany, Primojel (Sodium starch glycolate) was supplied from DFE Pharma, Goch, Germany, L-Hydroxy-propyl cellulose LH-11 was supplied from Shin-Etsu, To-kyo, Japan, Ac-Di-Sol (Croscarmellose sodium) was sup-plied from FMC Bio Polymer, Wallingstown, Little Island, Cork , Ireland,  Aerosil 200 (Silica, colloidal anhydrous) was supplied from Evonik Industries , Rheinfelden, Ger-many, Kolliphor SLS Fine (Sodium Lauryl Sulphate) was supplied from BASF, Ludwigshaften, Germany, Magne-sium stearate was supplied from FACI SpA, Carasco, Italy and Talc from Merck, Darmstadt.API used in the experimental trials is character-ized with high water solubility and has molecular weight 352.48.

Samples were collected at six time points: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 45 minutes. For determination of dissolution rate of active sub-stance UV absorptionspectrophotometric method was used.The content of dissolved API was calculated by mea-suring the UV absorptions of the test and standard solution at detection of 221 nm.Results and discussionBased on the results from the extensive dissolution evaluation on the experimental trials one may conclude that the most influential factor among the following: dis-integrant type, tablet average mass and API particle size is the disintegrant type. Namely, the dissolution profile is most highly affected when pre-gelatinized starch is in-corporated into the formulation in comparison to sodium starch glycolate and crosscarmelose sodium. This results point to conclusion that dissolution of the highly dosage highly water-soluble API is rather fastened by the parti-tioning of the dissolution media between the pre-gelati-nized starch and the API than with the use of a classical su-per-disintegrants. The high percent of the API in the for-mulation support this assumption having in mind that the mechanism of the super-disintegrants is hindered by this high percent of the API (85w/w% of the API in tablet for-mulation).As per the second factor, increase of the average mass of the tablet with other excipients (fillers) did not cause any increase on the dissolution of the API due to the fact that this slight percent of mass increase was not enough to mod-ify and support the mechanism of disintegration related to super-desintegrants.The third factor, particle size of the API (achieved by sizing with different sieve size) was also found to be not influential as the disintegrant type probably due to the API is characterized with high water solubility and penetration of the dissolution media is not hindered by different parti-cle size of the API.ConclusionThe presented study shows that optimized concentra-tion of Starch 1500/ partially pre-geletanized Maize starch and the combination of two selected disintegrants (L-HPC and Primojel/sodium starch glycolate), as well as sizing step of the active pharmaceutical ingredient have influ-ence on the dissolution rate of the highly dose water sol-uble API.ReferencesBolhuis, G.K., Arends,A.W., Stuut, G.J., Vries, J.A., 1994.

There are many naked antibod-ies and immunoconjugates commercially approved for dif-ferent types of cancer (Mehren et al., 2003). In order to im-prove specificity and selectivity of cytotoxic drugs and tox-ins, monoclonal antibodies are used for formulation of im-munoconjugates. Many efforts are done to develop stable immunoconjugates of trastuzumab with various drugs, tox-ins and radioisotopes to improve the general conditions of the patients (Sharkey and Goldenberg, 2006). The aim of this paper is to focus on current achievements in the for-mulation of radioimmunoconjugates of HER2-targeting trastuzumab.Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-body active against HER2 positive breast cancer. It orig-inates from murine antibody 4D5 that is potent inhibitor of HER2 positive cancer cells. Subsequently, it was cho-sen for further clinical development in order to reduce the probability of generation of HAMA (human anti-murine antibody) (Harries and Smith, 2002). Carter et al. (1992) cloned hypervariable regions from 4D5 in plasmids which encode formation of constant regions from human IgG1 antibody and generated a vector that encode formation of chimeric antibody which is additionally humanized. The new humanized 4D5 has higher affinity for the HER2/neu antigen and reduced immunogenicity. Trastuzumab is act-ing by binding to the IV subdomain of the HER2 receptor and Fc region of the antibody support ADCC (antibody-de-pendent cellular cytotoxicity) (Gennari et al., 2004). Radioimmunoconjugates for imaging and therapyBecause of the easy detection, radioimmunoconju-gates can be used for body imaging at a molecular level using sensitive imager like \u03b3 camera, computed tomogra-phy and positron emission tomography (PET) (Goldenberg, 1997). Significant radiopharmaceuticals based on pep-tide and antibody for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose use different radioisotopes (99mTc/188Re, 67Ga, 177Lu, 90Y, 131I) (Kassis, 2008). In order to obtain successful la-beling, previously  conjugaton with a bifuntional chela-tors (DOTA - 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tet-raacetic acid; DTPA - diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; TCMC - (1,4,7,10-tetra-(2-carbamoyl methyl)-cyclodo-decane; HYNIC - succinimidyl-6-hydrazino-nicotinamide; 1B4M-DTPA - 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-6-methyl-dieth-ylene-triaminepentaacetic acid) is required. These chelators allow binding to the antibody on the one side, and coordi-native binding of radioisotopes on the other side (Kang et al., 2012). Immunoconjugates of trastuzumab for PET imagingIn recent years there have been significant achieve-ments in development of stable immunoconjugates of trastuzumab for PET imaging of HER2 positive lesions (Hooge et al., 2004). Chen et al. (2008) used 99mTc in or-der to create a stable conjugate, 99mTc-NYCIN-trastu-zumab, useful for identification of HER2 positive metas-tasis. Tamura et al. (2010) have shown the possibility of identification of HER2 positive lesions in patients with pri-S4 PP 198418Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 417 - 418 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsmary metastatic breast cancer with 64Ga-DOTA-trastu-zumab. Three years later, Alitezapour et al. (2013) were able to formulate similar conjugate with another gam-ma emitter 67Ga-DOTA-trastuzumab for the same pur-pose. Investigations of Palm et al. (2003) for pharmaco-kinetics of trastuzumab labeled with pure \u03b2 emitters 86Y and 90Y in mice with ovarian cancershown a selective up-take of the conjugate by the tumor cells and minimal lo-calization in healthy organs. In vitro and in vivo investiga-tions in mice with breast tumor show that 177Lu-DOTA-trastuzumab can be new promising drug in treatment of hu-man breast cancer (Rasaneh et al., 2012). Tan et al. (2012) have shown that 212Pb-TCMC-trastuzumab has a signifi-cant therapeutic effect in HER2/neu positive prostate can-cer. Borchardt et al. (2003) have tested therapeutic effects of alpha emitters 227Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-trastuzumab and 225Ac-trastuzumab in mice with HER2 positive breast and ovarian cancer. Studies have shown rapid internalization and cytotoxicity in cancer cells which leads to a extend sur-vival and low toxicity.Our examinations will be focused on synthesis and evaluation of the immunoconjugates of trastuzumab with bifunctional chelators (DOTA, DTPA and 1B4M-DTPA) with already used method for freeze dried kit formula-tion of rituximab-conjugates. The most stable immunocon-jugate will be labeled with gamma emitter Ga-68 for fur-ther in vitro characterization and in vivo biodistribution. The simplicity of Ga-68 labeling will increase the access of radioimmunoconjugates in hospitals for PET imaging of HER2 positive metastasis.

Macedonia* aschuradio@yahoo.comBackgroundThis article describes trends in Radiopharmacy in the developing countries and the current status of Radiophar-macy Practice in Eastern Africa.The main goal of our presentation is to show and to stress the importance of existing problems related to the missing of the exact information on the number, status and size of Radiopharmacy units in African countries as the re-gional status as well as for the human resources, education, suitable training and local demand for the Radiopharmacy and Nuclear Medicine services is not documented (Don-di, 2006).The Radiopharmacy Practice by the definition requires well-defined and controlled conditions to avoid any risk contamination with microbes, pyrogens and particulate matter as well as cross contamination with other radiophar-maceuticals, together with established radiation protection.Implementation of the Good Radiopharmaceuti-cal Practices in all levels in the Radiopharmacy should be planned, introduced by the planned priority and strict-ly monitored and reordered in the production, prepara-tion, testing and in the packaging areas for all final prod-uct ready for use.The practice of nuclear medicine using established ra-diopharmaceuticals, mostly from the first generation has clinical applications in virtually all systems of the body, for example, the skeletal, cardiac, endocrine, oncologic, gastrointestinal and renal systems. The commoner nucle-ar medicine procedures in African developing countries are the bone scan, thyroid scan and the renal scan respective-ly.Almost all radiopharmaceuticals are parenterally admin-istered and requires techniques and procedures that guar-antee sterility of the product done according to the clear-ly defined protocol and and established and controlled con-ditions.  The critical moment for the realization of all these necessities is to have suitably staff, enough educated and trained to provide the implementation and development in the right direction.Radiopharmacy professionals should have an adequate training in all aspects of the sterile production, quality con-trol, GMP, GLP, radiation safety and radiochemistry to en-sure the competent handling of the radioactive materials (IAEA NUMDAB, 2009).MethodologyThe practice of radiopharmacy combines the exper-tise of pharmaceutical preparation and the skills needed to handle radioactive substances. Diagnostic radiopharma-ceuticals do not normally have any pharmacologicale ffect and their administration is not associated with major clin-ical side effects. Their clinical use, however, is associated with a risk deriving from radiation exposure and possible contamination during radiopharmaceutical formulation by chemical, biological and microbiological impurities.Accordingly, principles of Good Practices should be planned in all levels, by priority and strictly observed in the production, preparation, testing and the packaging of the final product ready for use. The main powerful key for implementing Good Radiopharmaceutical Practice is qual-ified and trained personnel. Trained and competent staffs are essential for achieving high standards and growth in Radiopharmacy. In African Countries there is an acute shortage and in some countries an absence of nationally registered pharmacists with radiopharmacy experience. Most nuclear medicine facilities operate their radiophar-macies with the support of technologists not trained in ra-diopharmacy practices. For that reason the basic quali-S4 PP 199420Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 419 - 420 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsty systems in the Radiopharmacy laboratory could be im-proved significantly with the better training. This competency-based training is the first step to pro-vide the essentials of a trainingprogramme for all radio-pharmacy practitioners that addresses the following re-quirements:- Standardization of training for staff members that operate in hospital radiopharmacy prac-tice;- To improve performance and management of the radiopharmacy service;- To encourage good radiopharmacy practices for the preparation and quality assurance;- To establish a quality management system which encourages continuous update of core competencies in hot laboratory staff.- Encourages continuous update of core compe-tencies in hot laboratory staff.ResultsOne of the key bottlenecks for Nuclear Medicine is a human resources shortfall, especially radiopharmacists. There is an acute shortage and in many countries absenc-es of pharmacists with radiopharmacy experience. Most of Nuclear Medicine facilities operate at IAEA operational level 1 and 2\u2019 mainly with support of technologists. There is a global need for effective implementation of the \u2018oper-ational guidance on hospital radiopharmacy-a safe and ef-fective approach\u2019 under which there is a strong recommen-dation to strengthen skills, competencies and professional qualifications of all staff involved in clinical radiopharma-cy practice. They should be empowered to address the poor state of Radiopharmaceutical laboratories in many coun-tries and be more aware of cost of radiopharmaceuticals. For safety of patient they should be aware of proper registration of radiopharmaceuticals and quality assess-ment required locally. At the time when there are difficul-ties with supply and relative high cost of routine radiophar-maceuticals, trained staffin Radiopharmaceutical laborato-ries could make the difference to Nuclear Medicine (IAEA NUMDAB, 2009).The trained radiopharmacist should have a:1. working knowledge of the radiopharmaceuti-cal terms, abbreviations, and symbols commonly used in prescribing, compounding and dispensing radiopharmaceuticals2. working knowledge of the procedures and tech-niques relating to aseptic compounding and par-enteral admixture operations.3. working knowledge of the procedures and opera-tions relating to the reconstitution, packaging and labeling of radiopharmaceuticals4. the ability to perform the usual functions associat-ed with a specific radiopharmacy.5. the ability to perform the manipulative and record keeping functions associated with the compound-ing and dispensing of radiopharmaceuticals6. manipulative and record keeping function sassoci-ated with quality control testing of radiopharma-ceuticals7. working knowledge of drug dosage by imaging-procedure, routes of administration, dosage forms, and be able to distinguish8. the ability to perform the essential functions relat-ing to drugpurchasing and inventory control9. appropriate knowledge and understanding of the specific nuclearpharmacy site with emphasis on the technician duties and responsibilities, includ-ing standards of ethics governing pharmacy prac-tice therapeutic from diagnostic radiopharmaceu-tical utilization10. ability to perform them a thematical calculations required for the usual dosage determinations and solution preparations in the compounding and dis-pensing of radiopharmaceuticals.11. Demonstrate appropriate working knowledge of any additionaltraining or safety requirements mandated by the pharmacy or by any local, state, or federal agency by successful completion of any required program (DAT on-line, 2011).ConclusionThis paper present our idea how to create suitable training and network of all professionals and state author-ities for establishing and develop education for Good Ra-diopharmacy Practice, qualified personnel and appropriate regulation according to the local and international parame-ters that will be step forward to have advanced health care system and confidence of the patients.ReferencesDAT on-line, 2011.

The solid-state compatibility testing of the active phar-maceutical ingredients (APIs) CaCO3 and MgCO3 and the selected excipients was performed by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The compatibility was stud-ied by comparison of the FT-IR spectra of the pure samples (APIs and excipients) and freshly prepared binary mixture with the FT-IR spectra of the corresponding stressed binary mixtures. The appearance of new bands in the FT-IR spec-trum, non-typical for the APIs or excipients, can be consid-ered as most significant sign of possible solid-state inter-action and formation of new molecular species. Changes due the water/moisture intake, resulting in band broaden-ing or changes in the band resolution and intensities in the FT-IR spectra, can be considered normal, because the sam-ples were exposed directly to the external influence, with-out any protection or packaging.The aim of this experiment was to investigate possible solid state interaction between APIs and the described ex-cipients, based on the induced changes in the infrared spec-tra of the binary mixtures exposed at different external con-ditions, compared to the infrared spectra of the pure com-pounds and the freshly prepared mixtures. The obtained re-sults afforded deeper insight into the solid-state stability of the studied binary mixture.Materials and methodsDuring development of the CaCO3 and MgCO3 tablets several excipients were evaluated for compatibility with the active ingredients as a screening for potential choice for tablet formulation. APIs: Calcium carbonate (CaCO3, purchased from Solvay Osterreich GmbH, Austria) and Magnesium carbonate heavy (MgCO3, purchased from Dr.PaulLohmann, Germany); Excipients: Silica, colloidal anhydrous (purchased from Evonik Resource Efficiency GmbH, Germany); partially pre-gelatinized maize starch (purchased from Colorcon, USA); copovidone (purchased from BASF (BTC Europe GmbH), Germany); xylitol (pur-chased from Roquette, France); low-substituted hydroxy-propylcellulose (purchased from ShinEtsu, Japan); spear-mint flavor SD (purchased from Symrise AG, Germany); menthol L flavourspraydried (purchased from Symrise AG, Germany); talc (purchased from Merck, Germany) and Mg stearate (purchased from FACI SpA, Italy).Binary mixtures were prepared by dry mixing of equal amounts of APIs and each excipient in 1:1 ratio (w/w). This ratio is different than the ratio used in the formulation, but according to the literature (Cunha-Filho et al., 2007), the equal masses afford bigger possibility for solid-state in-teraction among the constituents of the mixture. Pure APIs, excipients, and corresponding binary mixtures were stressed by 30 days exposure in stability testing chambers, at open Petri dishes, at temperatures of 40 \u00baC and 25 \u00baC, with a relative humidity (RH) of 75% and 60%, respec-tively. FT-IR spectra of pure APIs and excipients, freshly pre-pared binary mixture and stressed binary mixtures after 30 days were recorded and evaluated.The FT-IR spectra were recorded using ATR method, in the 4000\u2013550 cm-1 region, on Varian 660 FT-IR spec-S4 PP 201422Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 423 - 424 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationstrometer (Varian, Australia) (resolution 4 cm\u22121, 16 scans per spectrum). Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectra were obtained by MIRAcleZnSe ATR module (PIKE tech-nologies) with low pressure micrometer clamp.Results and discussionBased on the comparison of the FT-IR spectra of pure CaCO3 and pure MgCO3, with fresh prepared binary mix-tures and corresponding excipients, it can be concluded that in all cases the most prominent vibrational bands of the APIs can be identified in the initial prepared binary mix-tures. Although, generally being obscured and overlapped by strong bands of the APIs, few stronger bands originat-ing from the present excipient can be identified in some of the binary mixture. No additional bands, of unknown ori-gin, were observed. In regards of the FT-IR spectra of the starting bina-ry mixture and the FT-IR spectra of the same mixture af-ter exposure for 30 days at 25 \u00baC/60% RH and 40 \u00baC/75% RH, it can be concluded that no significant spectral chang-es were observed, except in binary mixtures between stud-ied APIs with xylitol and copovidone. In the FT-IR spec-tra of these binary mixture exposed at stressed conditions some spectral changes were observed according to higher moisture. Having in mind that both of excipients are hygro-scopic at high moisture (Raymond et al., 2009), pure xy-litol and copovidone were exposed 30 days at 40 \u00baC/75% RH. Based on the obtained FT-IR spectra, it can be con-cluded that spectral changes observed in the FT-IR spec-tra of the stressed binary mixtures are results from the ab-sorbed moisture from xylitol and copovidone, which can be confirmed by their FT-IR spectra.ConclusionThe closer inspection of the FT-IR spectra of the ob-tained binary mixtures of CaCO3 and MgCO3 with the pro-posed excipients, clearly demonstrated that there are no significant spectral changes induced in the FT-IR spectra during the screening period at all testing conditions. The preformulation studies have shown that in the FT-IR spec-tra in the binary mixtures between: CaCO3 with xylitol and CaCO3 with copovidone; and MgCO3 with xylitol and MgCO3 with copovidone; exposed at stressed conditions, some spectral changes were observed due to moisture up-take by the excipient with hygroscopic properties. These findings were confirmed by comparison of the spectral changes observed in the FT-IR spectra of the stressed binary mixtures and the individually stressed xyli-tol and copovidone. The compatibility studies as a part of preformula-tion screening of the excipients aimed for development of CaCO3 and MgCO3 solid dosage form were beneficial and give useful directions for development of a stable and ef-fective formulation.ReferencesCunha-Filho, M.S.S., Martinez-Pacehco, R., Landin,M., 2007.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* ssimeonovska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionTablets as solid preparations can range from relative-ly simple immediate release formulations to complex mod-ified release drug dosage forms. The desired drug release properties could be adjusted by proper selection of excip-ients used in the formulation as well as by technological process and process conditions selected.Numerous unit processes are involved in making tab-lets, including blending, granulating, drying, compaction and coating. Various factors deriving from these processes can affect content uniformity, drug release rate and/or sta-bility of tablets.The fluid-bed method of wet granulation is well known in the pharmaceutical and other industries as a one-step, enclosed operation. Because several ingredients can be mixed, granulated, and dried in the same vessel, the technique reduces material handling and shortens process times compared with other wet granulation techniques. In addition to granulation for tableting, the fluid-bed top-spray method produces highly dispersible granules with a characteristic porous structure that enhances wettabili-ty and improves many of the powder properties for tablet compression. Granules of high quality can be obtained by understanding and controlling the critical process parame-ters by timely measurements (Parikh, 1997).The aim of this study was to develop immediate re-lease tablets with water insoluble drug (API), using fluid- bed granulation technique.Materials and methodsMaterials API from BCS Class II/IV (particle size D50 less than 20\u00b5m, freely soluble in dichloromethane, sparingly solu-ble in toluene, insoluble in methanol and water) as model drug substance was used. Other excipients used in the for-mulation were: lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cel-lulose, starch maize, hydroxypropylcellulose, croscarmel-lose sodium, magnesium stearate and iron oxide. All chem-ical used in this present study are approved for use in phar-maceutical industry.Preparation of the granulesThree different formulations of granules were pre-pared using fluid-bed granulation process (H\u00fcttlin GmbH, Hohe-Flum-Strasse 42, Schopfheim, top spray configu-ration, Germany). Water solution of hydroxypropylcellu-lose was used as granulation vehicle. Fluid-bed granula-tion was performed under the following working condi-tions: air volume 15 m3/h; inlet temperature 66 \u00b0\u0421; atom-izing pressure 0.5-1 bar; mycroclimate 0.3-0.8 bar; filter pressure 0.8-1 bar; filter cleaning period 2 sec.; filter blow time 0.2 sec. After finishing the atomization of the binder solution, the granules were dried for a variable period of time in the same apparatus at 66 \u00b0C inlet temperature and air volume 15 m3/h.For preparation of sample 1, API was granulated to-gether with lactose monohydrate, while starch maize, mi-crocrystalline cellulose and iron oxide were added extra-granularly. For sample 2, API was granulated together with all excipients used in the formulation (lactose monohy-S4 PP 200424Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 421 - 422 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsdrate, starch maize, microcrystalline cellulose and iron ox-ide). For sample 3, API was granulated together with lac-tose, part of croscarmelose sodium and starch maize, while microcrystalline cellulose, iron oxide and the other part of croscarmelose sodium were added extragranulary.All prepared samples were finally mixed with magne-sium stearate (5 min.; Drum blender, Erweka PM5, Ger-many) and compressed by a rotary tablet press (KorschXL 100 Pro, Korsch AG, Germany), using round shaped 6 mm punches.Determination of granules and tablets characteristicsFinal blends were evaluated for loss on drying and flow properties. Loss on drying (LOD) was analyzed in Sartori-us Infrared dryer MA 35 (Germany). Granulate in quanti-ty of 1 g was dried to constant mass. The loss of mass was presented as percent m/m (Ph. Eur 8.7). Flowability of granulates was determined according to Ph. Eur 8.7 with Granulate flow tester (Erweka type GTB, Erweka, Germany). Nearly 50 g of granulate was poured from funnel and the time required to empty the funnel was measured. Determination of disintegration time and dissolution test of the compressed tablets was performed according to the official methods from the European Pharmacopoeia. For that purpose 6 tablets were placed in baskets of appa-ratus for disintegration (Erweka type ZT302, Erweka, Ger-many). Time required for disintegration was measured au-tomatically. Dissolution testing was conducted in 900 ml of disso-lution medium hydrochloric acid buffer pH 1.2 (USP 38 NF 33) at 37 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C using Apparatus II paddle (Varian VK, USA). Apparatus was adjusted to a speed of 60 rpm. Aliquots were taken at regular time intervals (after 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 45 min) and replaced with an equal volume of pre-warmed hydrochloric acid buffer. Withdrawn ali-quots were analysed for drug content using previously val-idated HPLC method (Hitachi HPLC system, Japan), col-umn 150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5\u00b5m, at 25 \u00b0C and flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Quantification of API was detected by UV at 250 nm.Results and discussionLOD as a parameter is extremely important for the pro-cess of fluid-bed granulation and drying. Obtained results indicated that sample 2 has the lowest loss of mass (3.1%) in comparison with samples 1 and 3 (3.25 and 3.74%, re-spectively) probably due to the presence of microcrystal-line cellulose into the granule matrix. Even though micro-crystalline cellulose allows rapid addition of the granulat-ing fluid, the water does not become bound inside, but rath-er it is easily given up during drying process. This proper-ty aids in preventing case hardening and uniform moisture content in granules (FMC Pharma, 2000). Results obtained for the flow properties of the final blends indicated that the flowability was excellent for all prepared samples (10, 8.7 and 10.8 sec for sample 1, 2 and 3, respectively). The macroscopic appearance of the tablets was satis-fying. All prepared tablets were smooth and elegant and no mottling was observed. Uniform appearance of the tab-lets was probably due to presence of microcrystalline cel-lulose, which enables equal migration of added dyes (FMC Pharma, 2000). The results of disintegration time show that all pre-pared samples have disintegration time less than 15 min-utes (1.38, 2.35 and 1.21 min for sample 1, 2 and 3, re-spectively). Sample 1 did not meet acceptance criteria for immedi-ate release tablet dosage forms (80.22% were dissolved for 30 minutes). On the other hand, sample 2 and 3 were char-acterized by > 85% dissolved API at the time interval of 30 min (90.06% and 91.82%, respectively). Obtained results pointed to the rationality of microcrystalline cellulose in-tragranular incorporation (sample 2) as well as addition of croscarmellose sodium (sample 3) equally between the in-tra and extra granulation. ConclusionIn the present work efforts have been made to develop immediate release tablets with water insoluble API using fluid-bed granulation as a promising approach to enhance the drug release profile. The results showed that the release of the drug was depended on type of excipient used in the formulation. Formulation containing 2% croscarmellose sodium showed minimum disintegration time and better drug release profile as compare to other formulations.ReferencesFMC Pharma, B., 2000.

Macedonia* mdokova@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionPharmaceutical semisolid preparations may be de-fined as topical products intended for application on the skinor accessible mucous membranes to provide local-ized and sometimes systemic effects at the site of applica-tion. However, most of the semisolid preparations are ap-plied to the skin for topical relief in dermatologic condi-tions (Swarbrick et al., 1990). Several categories of semi-solid preparations for cutaneous application may bedistin-guished: ointments, creams, gels and pastes. These topical formulations are composed of drug in asuitable semisolid base which is either hydrophobic or hydrophilic in charac-ter (Allen et al., 2011).Depending on the physicochemical properties, desired site of action and formulation strategies for the drug de-livery incorporation into semisolids can show their activ-ity on the surface layers of tissues or via penetration into deeper layers to reach the site of action or through system-ic delivery. Nonetheless if the drug is to act locally or sys-temically, it must first penetrate the stratum corneum (Raw et al., 2013).To treat a number of painful conditions affecting the joints and muscles, such as backache, rheumatic and mus-cular pain, sprains, strains and sports injuries, an active in-gredient that belongs to a group of non-steroid anti-inflam-matory drug (NSAID) was used. During formulation de-velopment, in order to obtain a stable, transparent, homo-geneous hydro-alcoholic gel for topical use with satisfacto-ry rheological properties, several gelling agents were test-ed such as hydroxyethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, poloxamer and carbomers.The aim of this research work wasto show the influ-ence of different types of polymers as gelling agents on physical properties of gel, like grittiness, viscosity and spreadability which are important for achieving therapeu-tic efficiency.Materials and methodsMaterialsNSAID (BCS class II), Poloxamertype 407, Carbomer, grade 940,C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer,ethanol 96%, diisopropanolamine, sodium hydroxide, propylene glycol, levomenthol.EquipmentLaboratory mixer homogenizer (IMA Stephan UMC 5,Germany), magnetic stirrer (IKA Ret control/t, Germa-ny), viscometer (Brookfield model DV2T with T- bar spin-dle, USA), pH meter (Seven Compact Mettler Toledo, Germany),Morphologi-G3S, (Malvern instruments, UK).Preparation of gelsMethod of preparation of samples iskept to be same. Processing steps include hydration of the polymer with mixing until complete hydration is obtained. Next is the gel forming step,where with appropriate gel forming agent clear gelwasachieved. Separately, process of dissolving of active ingredient, levomentholand propylene glycol into ethanol 96% is performed.This solution is added to gel base and homogenized.Sample S1 contains cross-linked polyacrylate polymer as a gelling agent and diisopropanolamineas a pH balanc-er. Organic amines are commonly used to neutralize poly-mers as agents for gel formation. In sample S2, C10-30 al-kyl acrylate crosspolymer, polymer of the same group, but with different physical characteristics was used. The sam-ple S3 was prepared with Poloxamer as a gelling agent.

As a medium for hydration and swelling of polymer,water purified was used. Levomenthol in the for-mulation was chosen as a cooling agent and skin penetra-tion enhancer.Physical properties of the prepared formulationThe produced gels were evaluated for grittiness, vis-cosity and spreadability as physical tests.Grittiness (texture)The samples were evaluated microscopically for the presence of any appreciable particulate matter, seen un-der light microscope. Proper quantity from the samples was applied directly to the glass for viewing under a mi-croscope with a thickness that is appropriate for the lens.The gel should fulfil the requirement of absence of par-ticular matter and from grittiness as desired for any topi-cal preparation.This test was performed on three selected samples with differentpolymers on Morphologi-G3S Malvern in-struments, UK.ViscosityRheological properties such as viscosity of semisolid dosage forms can influence their drug delivery. The vis-cosity of the formulations was performed using Brookfield viscometer DV2T model with T \u2013 Bar spindle, Brookfield. The test was developed according to European Pharmaco-poeia test 2.2.10 (Ph. Eur. current version).For the measurement approximately 50 g of gel were filled in a 100 ml beaker and the T-bar spindlewas lowered perpendicular in the centre taking care that the spindle does not touch bottom of the beaker. The viscosity was read as a single point measurement after 60 s, rotating with 5 rpm at room temperature. Spreadability testThe spreadability is a test of the gel easiness of appli-cation. The spreadability of the samples was determined according to in-house test and is referenced according to Rao et al.(2010)  by measuring 1 g gel between horizon-tal plates (20 x 20 cm2), after 1 minute. The standardized weight tied on the upper glass was 125 g. The results were calculated according to a formula.The spreadability (S) can be calculated using formula:Where:      S \u2013spreadability(g.cm/sec)     m - weighttied to upper glass slide (g)     l - lengthmove on the glass slide (cm)     t \u2013timetaken (sec)Results and discussionFor this purpose three different hydro-alcoholic gels-were prepared for testing certainphysical properties.Grittiness (texture)All samples have a homogeneous appearance without particulate matter.That is an expected result for this kind of topical formulations.ViscosityThe results from measurements are 54 000, 41 600 and 700 000 cP for the samples S1, S2 and S3 respectively.Viscosity results were influenced by the gelling properties andmolecular weight of thepolymers.Spreadability testAverage result from ten measurementsof the samples S1, S2 and S3 were 10.04 g.cm/sec, 10.96 g.cm/secand 5.67 g.cm/sec, respectively. Results are in accordance with the viscosity values, similar between S1 and S2, S3 being least spreadable.ConclusionAll examined samples for the physical parameter grit-tiness gave satisfactory results.From the presented results it can be concluded that gel sample with Poloxamer is the most viscous and it has weaker spreadability properties compared to the samples with cross-linked polyacrylate-polymer and C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer. Samples S1 and S2 have optimal viscosity values, provide good spreadability properties and are easy to apply on the affect-ed skin area.ReferencesAllen, L.V., Popovich, N.G.,  Ansel, H.C., (Eds.), 2011, Ansel\u2019s Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 9-th ed., Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, New York.European Pharmacopoeia, 8.7, European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Health Care, 2015.Rao, P.K., Khaliq, K., Kharat, S., Sagare, P., Patil, S.K, 2010.

Suspensions as dispersed sys-tems are composed of two or more phases, where the solid phase, usually the drug substance, is distributed throughout the polymeric matrix (Cox, 2008).Oral suspension described in this study is composed of active substance which belongs to BCS class II, and is nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory agent with very intensive burning taste, as is literally described as \u201cburning mouth effect\u201d. Taste masking effect is very difficult to achieve, but is inevitable step which must be satisfied during de-velopment of successful formulation of such oral suspen-sion. Different approaches are reported in the literature to achieve successful taste masking of bitter or unpleasant taste of drug, as follows: addition of flavoring and sweeten-ing agents, taste suppressants and enhancers, viscosity en-hancer, pH modifier, microencapsulation, coating with in-ert material, ion-exchange, inclusion complexation, granu-lation, adsorption, prodrug approach, by using liposomes, by effervescent agent etc. (Baig et al., 2014; Bhalerao et al., 2013; Suthar et al., 2010).During formulation development several combination of polymers and ion exchange resins in different ratio are being used. Polymers used for achieving the desired vis-cosity range were xanthan gum, carboxymethylcellulose sodium, microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcel-lulose sodium complex, maize starch, lambda carrageenan gum, and cross linked polyacrylic polymer. Materials and methodsFor preparation of the oral suspension, the following materials were used: xanthan gum, carboxymethylcellu-lose sodium, microcrystalline cellulose/ carboxymethyl-cellulose sodium , maize starch, lambda carrageenan gum, polacrillin potassium, cross linked polyacrylic polymer, surfactants, flavor, pH regulatory agents, sweeteners and purified water. All the experimental trials were prepared in sever-al continued steps including polymers hydration, swelling and incorporation of the active substance, using appropri-ate equipment: table balance (Sartorius CP 4202 S, Mettler PM 200, Germany), stirrer (IKA UltraTurrax T-50 basic, Germany), magnetic stirrer (Heidolph MR Hei-Tec, Ger-many), viscometer (Brookfield model RV with standard spindle set, Germany), pH meter (Seven Compact Mettler Toledo, electrode Inlab\u00ae Solids Pro, Germany). Seven different formulations were prepared. Combi-nations of different percentage of xanthan gum, and the same percentage of carboxymethylcellulose sodium and microcrystalline cellulose/ carboxymethylcellulose sodi-um, were included into 3 experimental trials (F1, F2 and F3). In the fourth formulation (F4), maize starch was in-corporated instead of carboxymethylcellulose sodium, and the fifth formula (F5) included lambda carrageenan gum instead of carboxymethylcellulose sodium. Method of preparation of the above mentioned trials consists of several processes which include preparation of polymer medium with hydration and swelling process un-der continuously stirring, and after that incorporation of the active substance into polymeric matrix. Additional in-active ingredients which enhance the organoleptic proper-ties and consistency of the suspension were added, such as sweetening agents, flavors, pH modifiers and surfactants. S4 PP 203428Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 427 - 428 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsInto the last two formulations (F6 and F7) ion-ex-change resins were included. They were prepared with complexation process between the ion-exchange resins and the active substance.Viscosity measurements were done of all of the pre-pared experimental trials using laboratory viscometer (Brookfield DV2T RV with standard spindle set, Germa-ny).The experimental conditions (600 ml beaker, filled with 350 ml suspension, viscosity measured after 60 sec-onds at 50 rpm of spindle rotation) are kept the same for all of the performed trials which means that the obtained re-sults are comparable with each other.The palatability study for the prepared experimental trials was performed by panel method. The study protocol was explained and written. Also, the consent was obtained from the volunteers. For this purpose, 10 human volunteers were selected. About 5 ml of the suspension was placed on tongue and taste evaluated after 15 seconds, using a nu-merical scale. The numerical scale consists of values as 0 = excellent, 1 = good, 2 = slightly burning mouth effect, 3 = burning mouth effect, 4 = intensive burning mouth effect, which were determined by the formulator.Also, measurement of the sedimentation volume of all of the experimental trials in the study was done. Sedimen-tation volume (F) is a ratio of the final or ultimate volume of sediment (Vu) to the original volume of sediment (Vo) before settling. It can be calculated by following equation:F = V u / Vowhere, Vu = final or ultimate volume of sedimentVo = original volume of suspension before settlingResults and discussionIn the formulations with ion \u2013 exchange resins, inter-action between the reactive functional group of the poly-acrylic polymer and ionisable active substance mole-cule occurs, until active substance - polymer complex is formed. The reaction is performed under determined pH and temperature values. The complex is insoluble in water and it has no taste, so the bitter taste of the active substance entrapped into the complex is masked. When such complex enters the gastro intestinal fluid, the bond between the active substance and polymer dif-fuses and the molecule of the active substance is released throughout a decomplexation process. The process of re-leasing the active substance is performed very quickly and completely into gastro intestinal fluid so it does not affect the absorption and bioavailability of the active substance. (Bilandi et al., 2014; Sampath Kumar et al., 2012).Different values for the viscosity measurement of all of the experimental trials were obtained, which logically were in correlation with the used percentage of the selected polymer. Values from viscosity measurement for the for-mulations F1, F2 and F3 were 1046 cP, 1234 cP and 1748 cP, as follows. For the trials F4, F5, F6 and F7 were ob-tained the following values 1040 cP, 1730 cP, 738 cP and 1916 cP, respectively.The sedimentation volume can have values ranging from less than 1 to equal or rarely, more than 1. The ulti-mate height of the solid phase after settling depends on the concentration of solid and the particle size. To obtain an ac-ceptable suspension the value of F should be at least 0.9. In the presented study there is no sedimentation after 14 days for all of the seven trials.ConclusionFrom the performed experimental trials it can be con-cluded that increasing the viscosity of the prepared oral suspension with combination of different percentage of xanthan gum, and the same percentage of carboxymeth-ylcellulose sodium and microcrystalline cellulose/car-boxymethylcellulose sodium, results into satisfactory taste masking effect which is more intensively achieved in com-parison with the rest of the experimental trials. The com-plexation process does not give a satisfactory taste mask-ing effect, although these formulations were optimistic and promising. The combination of the three polymeric matrices in the optimized concentration, which results into satisfacto-ry viscosity of the suspension containing nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory active substance, was chosen as a favorite formulation and a candidate to work with in the future tri-als.ReferencesBaig, V., Chavan ,S.B., Begum, S.N., Baseer, M.A., 2014.

Cyril & Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* tanjakjurkchieva@yahoo.comIntroductionPharmaceutical/cosmetic industry trends are focused toward development of innovative formulations character-ized by controlled release of active ingredient (AI) in or-der to enhance effectiveness and to reduce AI related side/adverse effects. Microsponges (MSPs) incorporated into well known dosage forms represent new generation of highly effective formulations. MSPs efficacy is related to particle size and size distribution, porosity, pore size, surface area, AI en-capsulation efficiency (EE) and release rate. MSPs` char-acteristics (physico-chemical, biopharmaceutical) influ-encing their efficacy might be tailored using certain prep-aration technique, as well as formulation and process pa-rameters. Effect of formulation variables upon MSPs` EE is going to be presented in this review. Quasi-emulsion sol-vent diffusion technique was most commonly used meth-od for MSPs preparation, while drug to polymer ratio and composition of internal and outer (external) phase were identified as significant formulation variables that influ-enced EE.Influence of drug to polymer ratioEE of Ethyl cellulose (EC) or Eudragit RS100 (ERS100) based MSPs loaded with fluconazole (Abdel-malak and El-Menshave, 2012), was in a range of \u223c15 to 90% depending from the variables studied. Results from their study pointed that increased polymer quantity result-ed with higher EE (\u223c45% vs 55% for 1:1 and 1:2 drug to polymer ratio (DPr), respectively). According to authors the findings might be related to the fact that higher polymer amount would result with increased viscosity of internal organic phase (IOP), thus reducing drug molecule diffu-sion into the external phase (EP) or simply higher amount of polymer encapsulated more drug molecules. Contrary, studies related to ERS100 MSPs loaded with diclofenac diethylamine (DPr 1:1 to 1:6) (Osmani et al., 2015a) or domperidone (DPr 1:1 to 1:5) (Osmani et al., 2015b) showed opposite trend. Determined diclofenac di-ethylamine EE values ranged \u223c10% for DPr 1:6 to 48% for DPr 1:1 (Osmani et al., 2015a), while domperidone EE were \u223c73% (DPr 1:5) to 92% (DPr 1:1). Similar were the findings for benzoil peroxide EC MSPs (Jelvehgari et al., 2006) prepared with DPr of 1:1 to 13:1 characterized by EE of 70-98%, whereas probably higher drug quantity would result with increased EE as more drug molecules per polymer unit are available.Studies of \u00c7omo\u011flu at al. (2003), Orlu et al. (2006) and (D\u2019souza and More, 2008) related to EE of ERS100 MSPs loaded with ketoprofen (DPr 1:1 to 11:1, EE \u223c92-96%), flurbiprofen (DPr 3:1 to 5:1, EE \u223c96-97%) and fluo-cinolone acetonide (DPr 1:1 to 13:1, EE \u223c87-94%) accord-ingly, indicated that EE was not much affected by DPr. Studies of Arya and Pathak (2014) and Srivastava et al. (2012) associated to ERS100/EC and ERS100 MSPs load-ed with curcumin and meloxicam, respectively, were con-ducted using experimental design studies. EE were \u223c80-93% for curcumin ERS100/EC MSPs and \u223c71-99% for meloxicam ERS100 MSPs. Derived correlations between EE and studied variables - EC amount (300-900mg) in the IOP and Polyvinil alcochol (PVA) (0.5-1.5% w/v) in the EP (Arya and Pathak, 2014) and volume of organic media - di-chloromethane (DCM)(5-7 ml) and ERS100 content (400-S4 PP 204430Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 429 - 430 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentations1200 mg) in DCM (Srivastava et al., 2012) pointed to the positive influence of polymer quantity, although later noti-fied that wasn`t statisticaly significant as it was expected. However, influence of interactions` factors upon EE was also identified. Similar findings were observed in the study of Gupta et al. (2015) where 5-fluorouracil ERS100 MSPs were prepared using different polymer quantity (400-1200 mg) and IOP volumes (6-8 ml) consisted of ethanol:DCM mixture (7:3) (EE \u223c36-61%) as well as in the study of Pawar at al. (2015) related to oxybenzone EC MSPs pre-pared with DPr 1:1 to 1:3 and DCM - 3-5 ml (EE \u223c90-99%).Influence of organic phase  Influence of solvent type (ethanol, methylen chloride) upon MSPs` EE was investigated by Abdelmalak and El-Menshave (2012) where determined EE indicated that eth-anol was solvent of choice most likely due to the higher boiling point and hence lower evaporation rate thus de-creasing the diffusion rate into the EP.  Orlu et al. (2006) used 3, 5 and 10 ml ethanol for MSPs preparation, but however MSPs could be prepared only with 3 ml ethanol as IOP. When volume of DCM was increased from 5 to 15 ml in the study of Jelvehgari et al. (2006) a decrease of EE was observed (\u223c87 to 67%), most likely due to the lower-ing of drug concentration. Higher EE values in increase of IOP volume were de-termined by Gupta et al. (2015) and Pawar et al. (2015) probably due to the better drug solubility, but however in-verse correlation for interaction term of polymer amount and IOP volume was observed. Alike were the results of Srivastava et al. (2012) where additionally quadratic func-tions of investigated variables` influence upon EE were de-termined. Inverse dependency of EE to (IOP)2 might be linked to the formation of more porous MSPs thus facili-tating drug partitioning into the EP. Influence of surfactant concentration in the outer water phaseCurcumin EE of ERS100/EC MSPs (Arya and Pathak, 2014) showed positive correlation with the interaction of EC and PVA, while negative correlation was estab-lished with the influence of quadratic terms (EC2*PVA, EC2*PVA2). Influence of PVA on the EE was also deter-mined in the study of Jelvehgari et al. (2006) where ob-tained results pointed that benzoil peroxide EE was higher at lower PVA concentration (EE of 93.26% at 0.047% PVA and 77.87% at 0.187% PVA). Similar results were report-ed by Abdelmalak and El-Menshave (2012) where flucon-azole EE was inversely dependent from PVA concentration (EE \u223c40% at 0.75% PVA to > 70% at 0.5% PVA).  These observations were explained by probable formation of al-ternative hydrophobic regions dissolving some drug por-tions thus resulting with decreased EE.Opposite findings were determined when PVA solu-tion in a concentration of 0.03 to 0.07% was used as EP for preparation of domperidone ERS100 MPSs (Osmani et al., 2015b) and hence EE was \u223c76 to 90%, respective-ly.  The difference with the previous studies might be re-lated to the low PVA concentration used. Similar were the findings for diclofenac diethylamine ERS100 MPSs (Os-mani et al., 2015a) prepared with sodium alginate solution (0.03 to 0.07%) as EP which were characterized by slight increase of EE (\u223c85 to 93%), consequently.ReferencesAbdelmalak, N.S., El-Menshave, S.F., 2012.

They represent thermodynam-ically unstable disperse system, so it is necessary to add suspending agent which reduces the rate of settling and permits easy redispersion of any settled particulate matter, both by protective colloidal action and by increasing the consistency of the suspending medium. Gums and other polymers are frequently employed in pharmaceutical sus-pensions as viscosity building, thickening, stabilizing and suspending agents. They are used to delay or prevent sed-imentation by affecting the rheological characteristics of suspensions. Viscosity building agents increase the viscos-ity of an aqueous mixture without substantially modifying its other properties, such as taste. They provide body and improve stability of added ingredients (Moreton, 2010). The aim of the study is optimization of viscosity build-ing agent, xanthan gum in combination with hydroxyethyl cellulose in order to achieve stable oral suspension. In or-der to evaluate the optimal concentration of the viscosity building agent, formulations with different concentration of xanthan gum were made. Appearance and homogeneity of suspension, viscosity, sedimentation volume and disso-lution were evaluated.Materials and methodsMaterials Active pharmaceutical ingredient, sparingly soluble in water, para-aminophenol derivative that exhibits anal-gesic and antipyretic activity with bitter taste was used. Solvents, co-solvent, stabilising agent, sweetening agent, buffering agent and preservative were used. Xanthan gum (Jungbunzlauer, Austria) and hydroxyethyl cellulose (Ash-land, France) were used as viscosity building agents. Fla-vour and taste masking agent were used to mask the bitter taste of the active ingredient. All excipients are approved for use in pharmaceutical industry.MethodsSuspensions were produced by a common process for preparation of oral suspension by method of mixing with-out heating, dispersing of active ingredient and homoge-nization. Each of the laboratory trials was prepared under the same condition and with the same method. Suspensions were prepared with different concentration of xanthan gum 0.15%; 0.17%; 0.20%; 0.25% and 0.35%. The concentra-tion of hydroxyethyl cellulose was kept constant in all five laboratory trials. Visual inspection for appearance and ho-mogeneity of suspension, viscosity, sedimentation volume and dissolution was evaluated as critical parameters. Homogeneity of the prepared suspensions was evalu-ated using optical microscopy (Morphologi-G3S, Malvern instruments, UK). Viscosity of the suspensions was mea-sured with rotating viscometer (Brookfield, USA, with RV spindle No. 3; temperature 20\u00baC). Sedimentation volume is defined as the ratio of the final, equilibrium volume of the sediment to the total volume before settling (F = Vu /V0 x100; Vu \u2013 volume of sediment in ml; V0 \u2013 total volume of suspension in ml). The values for F range from 0 to 1. Val-ues of F = 1 indicate that no sediment is apparent and that the suspension is stable and flocculated (Mohammad et al., 2010).  Sedimentation volume was observed and calculat-ed for a period of 30 days, in the following intervals: 60 minutes; 180 minutes; 24 hours; 7 days and 30 days. Con-tent of dissolved active component was determinate with S4 PP 205432Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 431 - 432 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsHPLC method. Dissolution testing was conducted in 900 ml + 1% phosphate buffer pH 6.8+ 0.05 using USP appara-tus II (paddle), set at rotation speed of 50 rpm and temper-ature of the medium of 37 \u00b1 0.5\u00baC.Results and discussionHomogeneity of the prepared suspensions was evalu-ated microscopically and differences due to different con-centration of viscosity building agent were not observed. Suspensions with concentration of xanthan gum in range from 0.15%; 0.17%; 0.20; 0.25% to 0.35% were measured and results from 562 cP; 687cP; 752 cP; 1005 cP to 1233 cP, respectively for each concentration, were obtained. The increase of the concentration of xanthan gum resulted with an increase of viscosity of the suspensions, which was eas-ily visually noticed and after that confirmed by measure-ment with a rotating viscometer. The suspension with vis-cosity above 1000 cP showed bad pourability which can directly influences the proper dosing of the oral suspen-sion (Zatzx and Knapp, 1984). The suspensions were ob-served during a period of 30 days and sedimentation ef-fect was not observed. Sedimentation volumes for all eval-uated concentrations were 1, indicating that xanthan gum used in a range from 0.15% to 0.35% is capable of forming and maintaining a stable suspension for this period. The increase in viscosity avoids the particle aggregation and helps particles to remain in a flocculated state (Tempio and Zatz, 1980). Dissolution testing was performed on the pre-pared suspension and the following results were obtained 98.22%, 95.15%, 92.22%, 89.42% and 67.95% for each concentration respectively, for the time point of 30 min-utes and 99.52%, 98.21%, 97.36%, 91.50% and 81.65%, for the time point of 45 minutes. The percent of dissolved active component decrease by increasing the concentration of xanthan gum, or viscosity of the suspensions. Obtained results from dissolution of the suspensions were higher for the time point of 45 minutes in comparison with the results for 30 minutes. From the results can be noticed that due to its polysaccharide nature the viscosity building agent has the ability to decrease the dissolution rate of the ac-tive component when added in higher concentration (Ver-hoeven et al., 2006). As the viscosity of the dispersion me-dium increases, the terminal settling velocity decreases thus the dispersed phase settle at a slower rate and remain dispersed for longer time yielding higher stability of the suspension. On the other hand as the viscosity of the sus-pension increases, it\u2019s pourability decreases and the incon-venience to the patients for dosing increases. Also the in-crease of the viscosity resulted in decrease of the dissolu-tion rate of the active component, directly influencing the bioavailability of the drug.ConclusionWith concentration optimization of viscosity build-ing agent xanthan gum, viscosity of the suspension can be maintained within optimum range to yield a homogenous, stable suspension appropriate for oral delivery of the drug.

They are inert substances by definition but in many cases represent high proportion of the finished dosage form and their qual-ity significantly influences the effectiveness or safety of the drug. Excipients support the processing of the finished dos-age form during its manufacture; they protect, support or enhance stability, bioavailability or patient acceptability; help in product identification, or enhance other attribute of the general product quality attributes. Despite their critical role in the pharmaceutical formu-lation, there are no specific GMP regulations obligatory for their manufacturers. On the other hand, there are a huge number of applications of these materials which makes the development of appropriate guidelines very demanding. Currently, in the pharmaceutical industry there is a gener-al expectation that excipients are manufactured to recog-nised GMP principles (The Joint IPEC \u2013 PQG Good Man-ufacturing Practices Guide for Pharmaceutical Excipients, 2006).The major problem for Marketing Authorization Holders(MAHs) is that the excipient manufacturers pro-duce ingredients that are not only intended for use in phar-maceuticals but also in food, cosmetics, or as chemicals. The quantitative requirement for excipients in pharmaceu-tical products is often insignificant compared to their use in other applications; however, the quality of the ingredients for use in medicinal products could be essential to the safe-ty, quality and efficacy of the finished drug product (IPEC Federation Position Paper on EU Risk Assessment Guide-lines for Excipients 2015C/ 95/02).Most important global organizations which instruct and facilitate implementation of excipient quality stan-dards are EDQM (European Directorate for Quality of Medicines and Healthcare) and the IPEC (International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council). EDQM positionAt the moment it is the Eudralex Vol. 4, Part 2 guide-line, which refers to the quality system of API manufactur-ers and is sufficient and even higher standard for the excip-ient manufacturers.According to this guideline excipients and excipient manufacturers should be controlled based on the results of a formalised quality risk assessment (EudraLex, Volume 4 Good manufacturing practice (GMP) Guidelines, Part 1, Chapter 5: Production). The MAHs are required to have a documented risk assessment/management system for ap-propriate GMPs for excipients, available on site for review by EU GMP inspectors.According to The Guideline of 19 March 2015 on the formalised risk assessment for ascertaining the appropri-ate good manufacturing practice for excipients of medici-nal products for human use, the risk assessment principle consists of three parts:1. Determine the appropriate GMP level that the excip-ient manufacturer needs to achieve; 2. Determine the current GMP level that the excipient manufacturer has; 3. GAP analysis between these two GMP levels and proposing actions.The following specific areas of potential risks should be considered, understood and assessed when reviewing the excipient manufacturers\u2019 GMP level: risk aspects relat-ed to excipient quality and safety, and risk aspects related to excipient function in the drug product.S4 PP 206434Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 433 - 434 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsOnce the appropriate GMP for the excipient and the risk profile of the excipient manufacturer have been de-fined, the EU guidelines specify that ongoing risk review should be performed.IPEC\u2019s position The newest and customized guideline for excipient manufacturers that covers topics from the EU GMP guide-lines and ISO 9001 chapters is The Joint IPEC \u2013 PQG Good Manufacturing Practices Guide for Pharmaceutical Excipi-ents, 2006, which represents good base for implementation of the highest GMP for the excipient manufacturers.The major concern is that the risk assessment process by different MAHs could eventually classify one manufac-turer into different categories of risk (high, medium, low) depending on the different approaches and intended use. This could lead to different quality requirements by differ-ent companies for the same excipient. It would be impos-sible to comply with these different requirements in one quality system unless the highest level of GMP was to be implemented. IPEC is concerned that there is not enough time to complete risk assessments for all excipients by the March 21, 2016 deadline, and that incomplete assessments may jeopardize the availability of high\u2013quality excipients that have been in use for many years. IPEC will share their views with the EDQM on the challenges to comply with the current timeline and request more realistic goals and timelines (IPEC Federation Posi-tion Paper on EU Risk Assessment Guidelines for Excipi-ents 2015/C 95/02).IPEC views third\u2212party auditing and certification schemes, such as EXCiPACT, and national standards, such as NSF/IPEC/ANSI 363\u22122014, as playing an essential role to achieve compliance with new requirements for the qual-ification of excipients and their suppliers. Without addi-tional information about GMP and GDP compliance of the excipient manufacturers through independent third\u2212party audits, it will be nearly impossible for MAHs on their own to gather all the necessary data required (Quality Risk As-sessment for Excipients: An Industry Perspective, 2015).Regulatory authority\u2019s position Even though the groundwork for standardization is es-tablished, there is a concern from the regulatory author-ities: Ewan Norton of the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) gave an inspector\u2019s view of the new EU requirements on risk\u2212assessment of excipients, expressing concern that despite a 12\u2212month introduction period some pharma companies may not be ready to meet the deadline of 21 March, 2016. A survey carried out at an MHRA conference last year revealed that a considerable number of pharma industry had either not started the risk assessment process or were unaware of the upcoming requirements. Norton suggest-ed that inspectors would be inclined to serve companies with a deficiency in their report if they were not compliant with the requirements (Excipients insight January/Febru-ary 2016, IPEC e\u2212newsletter, 2016).Pharmaceutical industry position EFPIA (European Federation of Pharmaceutical In-dustries and Associations) supports the new legislation but is concerned that its implementation may lead to an abun-dance of regulatory guidance. EFPIA recommends that in-stead of formalized risk assessment the process should be integrated into existing supplier qualification management programmes. They recommend that it is not necessary to develop additional GMP guidelines for excipients since the risk management principle is already embedded in Part III EU GMP: Quality Risk Management (ICH Q9). They propose more effective legislation without un-necessary regulatory burden on manufacturers and suppli-ers to ensure continuous supply of quality excipients and finished drug products (EFPIA TDOC Position Paper).ConclusionIn the literature, depending on the standpoint there are an abundant number of guidelines, papers and articles that explain the general recommendations for risk assessment principle, but lack those describing hands\u2212on application. There are a limited number of case studies of the pharma-ceutical companies applying those guidelines and showing significance of those guidelines and practices.It is recommended that the literature invests more in the area of application and significance of guidelines and practices. New case studies should be done to prove the success of such practices in risk assessment of excipients.ReferencesEFPIA TDOC Position Paper.

In order to obtain and retain those characteristics, special consideration must be paid to proper storage of me-dicinal product. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) re-quires that raw materials, packaging materials, interme-diates, bulk and finished product are stored under appro-priate conditions. This also means that a maximum hold-ing period for intermediates and bulk products before their further processing should be established. In order to avoid any misunderstanding, it is important to define terms \u201cin-termediates\u201d and \u201cbulk products\u201d The term \u201cIntermediate\u201d is partly processed product that must undergo further man-ufacturing steps before it becomes a bulk product. \u201cBulk product\u201d refers to any pharmaceutical product that has completed all processing stages up to, but not including, fi-nal packaging (Eudralex, 2010).Hold-time studies guidanceUntil 2015, relevant guidelines (CPMP/QWP/122/02, 2003; ICH Q1A(R2), 2003; Eudralex, 2014; FDA Q1A(R2), 2003) thoroughly described the requirements for stability testing of finished drug product. The only statement in guidelines with regard to pharmaceutical bulk products or intermediates is that they have to be stored \u201cin a suitable way\u201d.In 2015, World Health Organization (WHO) released a final version of \u201cGeneral guidance on hold-time studies\u201d as a part of WHO Technical Report Series No. 992 (WHO, 2015). Although this guidance describes the principles of establishing criteria for performing hold-time studies on coated tablets, those principles can be applied to other non-sterile dosage forms. Recommendations for conducting hold-time studiesHold time is a period of time during which materials can be stored under defined conditions and will retain their quality within the specified limits. This implies that hold times should be established for the materials at different phases of manufacturing, so one can be sure that holding didn\u2019t compromise the quality of the finished product.Hold times should be established based on scientific data. It is recommended that the test is to be performed on one batch prior to registration of the product. All tests should be performed using validated stability-indicating methods. Storage conditions of samples are required to be the same as for the quarantine area or manufacture stage (WHO, 2015). Apart from that, sample should be stored in a simulated package mimicking the packaging of the bulk product (Huynh-Ba, 2009; WHO, 2015). This means that containers should be made of the same material and us-ing same closure system as the system in the manufactur-ing stage. If there is a risk of substance\u2019s degradation as a result of oxidation processes, headspace in the containers should also be tested. It is necessary to determine the ratio of headspace to contents in the containers, so degradation of substance is unlikely to occur (WHO, 2015).  S4 PP 207436Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 435 - 436 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyData to support holding times could be collected dur-ing drug development, on a pilot or validation batches. If the product is already on the market, guidance (WHO, 2015) leaves a possibility to perform retrospective hold-time studies. Collected data should be processed statisti-cally in order to note trends or to establish limits. Study should be performed through a period defined in the guid-ance, and not beyond that. It isn\u2019t necessary to prolong study until the lowest limit of quality is achieved. This ap-proach is based on a \u201cmost probable\u201d as opposed to \u201cworst case\u201d approach. For example, 90 days are enough time to keep core tablets as intermediates in the coated tablet man-ufacturing, to study hold-time stability (WHO, 2015). General guidance on hold-time studies (WHO, 2015) provides examples of stages, tests and study times that may be performed for a coated tablet. Coated tablet have been chosen as an example, since tablets are the most widely used dosage form. Apart from that, manufacture of tablets and, especially, coated tablets can be a complex process, including a variety of manufacturing stages (Armstrong, 2007). Each stage can, in some way, influence the quality of the final product.Once hold time is established, intermediates and bulk products should not be stored beyond this period.ConclusionHold-time study plays an important role in the manu-facturing of drug products in the GMP environment. The maximum hold time for intermediates and bulk pharma-ceuticals should be established in order to continue their processing or start the packaging of the drug products be-fore their quality becomes compromised.

It is a highly lipophilic compound whose partition coefficient is 2.36 when measured at 20 \u00b0C. Lorazepam, as an amphiphil-ic substance, has two pKa values (1.3 and 11.5) determined spectrophotometrically in aqueous buffers. It is main-ly used in different dosage forms as an active substance. The injectable solution comes in 1 mL ampoules contain-ing 2 or 4 mg lorazepam. As derivative of 1,4-benzodiaz-epines, has certain limitations in pharmaceutical technol-ogy due to its poor solubility in water. The aqueous solu-bility of lorazepam, particle size 8.9 \u03bcm, is 0.0485 mg/mL (Had\u017eiabdi\u0107 and Had\u017eovi\u0107, 2005-2006). Often, in a certain volume of water, an adequate concentration of the drug can-not be achieved during formulation of a liquid dosage form due to the low solubility of the drug (Jinal et al., 2012). This study investigated the use of the traditional sol-ubilization approaches to increase the solubility of loraz-epam. Our aim was to investigate the solubility of loraz-epam in phosphate buffer solutions, in water/cosolvents mixtures (cosolvents: ethanol, propylene glycol, polyeth-ylene glycol 200 and 400) (Corrigan and Healy, 2007; Vemula et al., 2010), and in water/surfactants mixtures [surfactants: Tween 80, Tween 20, Brij 35, sodium cho-late, sodium deoxycholate, sodium taurocholate] (Corri-gan and Healy, 2007; Rangel-Yagui et al., 2005) as well as its solubility in water/cyclodextrins mixtures [cyclo-dextrins: \u03b1-cyclodextrin (\u03b1-CD), \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD), 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (2-HP-\u03b2CD)] (Loftsson and Brewster, 2010; Sathesh Babu et al., 2008). The main objective was to find the most suitable method for provid-ing good solubility of lorazepam and thus its formulation in a liquid dosage form.Materials and methodsMaterialsUsed chemicals were obtained from: Lorazepam (LZ, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany); Acidum sulfuricum 95-97% and Methanolum (Kemika, Croatia); Acidum hydrochlo-ricum 37%, Disodium hydrogen phosphate and Potassi-um dihydrogen phosphate (Alkaloid, Macedonia); Acidum phosphoricum 85% (Fluka, Chemika, Switzerland); eth-anol 96%, Polyethylene glycol 200, Polyethylene gly-col 400 and Propylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany); Tween 20, Tween 80 and Brij 35 (Merck, Germany); So-dium cholate, Sodium deoxycholate, Sodium taurocho-late, \u03b1-CD, \u03b2-CD and 2-HP-\u03b2CD (Fluka, Chemika, Swit-zerland). Solubility studiesThe solubility of LZ was estimated by the solubility method of Higuchi and Connors (1965). Solubility mea-surements and the determination of saturation concentra-tions were carried out by adding excess amounts of loraze-pam to phosphate buffer solutions (pH 2.0-8.0), water/co-solvent mixtures (concentrations 1-60% w/w), water/sur-factants mixtures (concentrations 1-20% w/w, for anion-ic surfactants and 1-35% w/w, for non-ionic surfactants). Concentrations of cyclodextrins were selected based on S4 PP 208438Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 437 - 438 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationstheir solubility in water. Testing of LZ solubility with the addition of \u03b1-CD in aqueous solutions was carried out by its addition in concentrations up to 14%. The testing of LZ solubility was carried out in concentrations up to 1.8% of aqueous solutions of \u03b2-CD. The testing of LZ solubility with the addition of 2-HP-\u03b2-CD in aqueous solutions was carried out by its addition in concentrations up to 40%. The concentrations of dissolved LZ in tested solutions were de-termined using a Shimadzu UV-1601, UV VIS spectropho-tometer (Shimadzu, Japan).Results and discussionIt was found that LZ solubility was decreased with an increasing pH. When the pH value is lower, the percent-age of protonation of lorazepam is higher. Protonation at low pH occurs at the nitrogen atom in position 4. Deprot-onation occurs at a high pH with the loss of the hydrogen atom from the 3-hydroxyl group (Barrett et al., 1973).To prepare the aqueous solution of LZ (2 mg/mL), it is necessary to have more than 50% (w/w) of propylene gly-col, or more than 40% (w/w) of polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene glycol 200 or ethanol. To completely dissolve 4 mg/mL LZ in water more than 50% (w/w) of polyeth-ylene glycol 400 or polyethylene glycol 200 or less than 50% (w/w) of ethanol is needed. It is evident that LZ mole-cules preferably solubilize in a nonpolar environment rath-er than polar (aqueous) surroundings. The concentration of the solvents that enable this drug to be solubilized in water is far higher than that allowed for daily intake. Increase of surfactants concentration in water leads to LZ solubility enhancement linearly. The best solubility was achieved with sodium taurocholate, of all the tested bile salts, while the best LZ solubility in water was achieved with Brij 35, of all the tested non-ionic surfactants (Alkha-mis et al., 2003; Rangel-Yagui et al., 2005). To dissolve 2 mg/mL of LZ in water, more than 15% of sodium cholate, more than 5% of sodium deoxycholate, or less than 10% of sodium taurocholate concentrations are needed. To make a LZ concentration in liquid form of 2 mg LZ/mL of water, more than 5% of Tween 80, more than 7% of Tween 20, or less than 3% Brij 35 is needed. To dissolve 4 mg/mL of LZ in water, more than 20% of sodium cho-late, ~15% of sodium deoxycholate or less than 15% of so-dium taurocholate is needed. To dissolve 4 mg of LZ/mL of water, 20% of Tween 80, more than 15% of Tween 20 or less than 7% Brij 35 should be used. The surfactants with higher HLB values were better solubilizers. The increase of LZ solubility in aqueous solutions of chosen cyclodextrins, compared to its solubility in water. The solubility of LZ is increased 6.5-fold at 14% of \u03b1-CD, 4.38-fold at 1.8% \u03b2-CD, and 170.1-fold at 40% of 2-HP-\u03b2-CD. The changes in the solubility of LZ resulting from the addition of various concentrations of \u03b1-CD, \u03b2-CD and 2-HP-\u03b2-CD were used to plot phase solubility diagrams and to evaluate the stoichiometry and stability constant of the resultant complex. The phase solubility diagrams ob-tained are linear and show characteristics of AL-type of solubility curve. This is attributed to the formation of a sol-uble complex. The apparent stability constants (K1:1) were estimated from the straight line of the phase solubility dia-grams according to equation of Higuchi and Connors (Hi-guchi and Connors, 1965; Mosher and Thompson, 2007). In this case, the K1:1 values obtained followed the order 2-HP-\u03b2-CD > \u03b2-CD > \u03b1-CD, reflecting the greater affinity of modified cyclodextrin for LZ compared with their par-ent \u03b1-CD and \u03b2-CD. ConclusionBased on the results, the changes in the pH value of the media do not lead to a greater solubility of lorazepam. Of the cosolvents used, the greatest increase in solubility of lorazepam in water was achieved with ethanol. Of the bile salts used, sodium taurocholate showed the best solubili-zation ability, while Brij 35 was the best of the non-ionic surfactants. The solubility of lorazepam with the cyclodex-trin derivative, 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin was bet-ter than natural cyclodextrins. Surfactants have the high-est ability of solubilization of lorazepam in water. Thus, the study generates an array of data for solubilization of lorazepam using various pharmaceutically accepted tech-niques which could be useful while formulating liquid dos-age forms of lorazepam.ReferencesAlkhamis, K.A., Allaboun, H., Al-Momani, W.Y., 2003.

Different studies point to the connection of the inflamma-tion and tumorigenesis and the presence of  immunoinflam-matory mediators and inflammation in virtually all steps of colon cancer development, including initiation, promo-tion, progression, and metastasis. Therefore, the design con-cept of increased localization of micro and/or nanoparticles at the site of inflammation/cancer due to enhanced permea-bility and retention in the tissue damaged by inflammation/cancer may also be favourable for colon cancer targeting. Additionally, prolonged intimate contact with the epitheli-al membranes at the site of action, which may be enhanced by incorporation of bioadhesive polymers into the carriers is crucial for improvement of specific interaction with mu-cin and cell surfaces as well as for improved localization of the drug delivery systems at the site of action. Whence, the aim of this study was to design 5-fluorouracil loaded or-ganomodified silica microparticles as systems for controlled and site specific colon delivery as well as to investigate the influence of the concentration of the silane coupling agent 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane  (APTES) upon the micropar-ticle properties.Materials and methodsMaterials Silica microparticles were prepared using the follow-ing reagents: tetraethoxysilane (TEOS; Sigma, Germany), 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES; Sigma, Germany), ethanol 96% (v/v) (Merck, Germany), acetic acid (Merck, Germany), 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU; EBEWE Pharma, Aus-tria), and deionised water. All other used chemicals and re-agents were of analytical grade.Preparation of silica microparticlesSilica microparticles were prepared from tetraethoxysi-lane (samples MP1) and tetraethoxysilane co-hydrolyzed with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane by combining sol-gel technology with spray-drying. TEOS-based silica micropar-ticles (MP1) were synthesized by sol-gel method at room temperature using a one-step acid-catalized hydrolysis. Sil-ica sol was prepared by hydrolysis and polycondensation of TEOS with deionised water, ethanol and acetic acid as a cat-alyst. The molar ratio of the silica sol was TEOS: water : ethanol : acetic acid = 0.01 : 1.39 : 0.43 : 0.009. Hydrolised silica sol was spray dried with a mini spray dryer (B-290, B\u00fcchi Labortechik AG, Switzerland). 5-FU was added after completed hydrolysis and incorporated in microparticles in network synthesis phase at concentration 12 wt%. For par-tial substitution of  TEOS,  2.5 mol% (MP2) and 5 mol% (MP3) organomodified alkoxide was used. 5-FU was dis-solved in the hydrolised sol before spray drying at concen-tration of 12 wt%.Characterization of silica microparticlesPrepared silica microparticles were characterized in a terms of mean particle size and particle size distribution S4 PP 209440Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 439 - 440 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentations(Mastersizer 2000, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK), surface morphology (SEM; Jeol-SEM6400, Japan) and drug load-ing efficiency (HPLC Agilent 1200 with UV detector).Ex vivo mucoadhesion studies was performed and the percent of mucoadhesion was determined with modified everted sac method (Santos et al., 1999). In vitro drug release studiesThe dissolution test from prepared silica microparticles were carried out in closed glass tubes at 37 \u00b0C and 50 hori-zontal strikes/min (horizontal shaker; Shaker Unitronik OR, Selecta. Spain). To compare the drug release under differ-ent pH conditions, 50 mg of the microparticles  mixed with 10 ml buffer solution with pH 1.2 and 10 ml buffer solution with pH 7.4. At appropriate intervals, 2 ml of samples were withdrawn, filtered through 0.45 \u03bcm membrane filter, and assayed by HPLC method.In order to investigate the possible drug release mecha-nisms, data obtained from in vitro drug release studies were analyzed using different kinetic models (Higuchi equation, the traditional power law and modified power law) (Viitala et al., 2007). Determined n value  indicated most probable drug release mechanisam, while goodness of fit was evalu-ated using the r (correlation coefficient) values.Results and discussionPrepared particles were spherical with smooth sur-faces and unimodal narrow size distribution. Median vol-ume diameter of microparticles was 1.3876 \u03bcm (SPAN fac-tor 1.745), 2.1405 \u03bcm (SPAN factor 1.133) and 3.3763 \u03bcm (SPAN factor 1.713) for MP1, MP2 and MP3, respectively. The content of 5-fluorouracil was 89.5 mg (MP1), 145.71 mg (MP2) and 160.78 mg 5-FU/g microparticles (MP3). The experimental results suggest that addition of precursor 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane  in the silica sol influenced the inner structure of the matrix, resulting with increased porosity and hydrophilicity of the network, resulting in in-creased average paricle size and drug loading efficiency.The results from the in vitro drug release studies of TEOS based microparticles showed that the silica matrices are capable for controlled release of 5-FU during prolonged time periods. However, the dissolution rate was proportional to 5-FU loading, most probably because of possible strong 5-FU \u2013 silica interactions that could initiate formation of matrix microdeformations during the sol-gel process, result-ing in overall increase of matrix porosity (Djurdjic et al., 2011). pH dependent drug release was noticed from TEOS based particles with lower percent of 5-FU (2 and 6wt%) (Djurdjic et al., 2010, 2011), but pH dependency was lost when higher percent of 5-FU (12 wt%) was incorporated in the processed silica sol during production of the micropar-ticles, most probably because of increased matrix porosity. The drug release data showed the best fit to modified pow-er law equation; r2  were 0.967 and 0.963 at pH 1.2 and pH 7.4, respectively for sample MP1. Values n  for sample MP1 (0.07 and 0.09 at pH 1.2 and pH 7.4, respectively) point to drug diffusion through very porous matrix without capacity for control of the  release during time. Organically modified microparticles showed increased burst and increased drug release rate compared to TEOS based microparticles. Burst release varied accordingly to the percent of APTES. For formulations with highest percent of APTES and drug loading, the total ammount of incorporated 5-FU was released within few hours. The drug release data of organically modified microparticles show the best fit to modified power law model and r2  were 0.859 and 0.955 (at pH 1.2 and pH 7.4, respectively) for MP2. Values n  for sam-ple MP2 (0.16 and 0.13 at pH 1.2 and pH 7.4, respectively) indicating to drug diffusion through highly porous system. Formulations with high percent of APTES were unable to control the 5-FU release in time. The presence of -amino groups at the surface of AP-TES particles affected the intensity of interaction with cell membranes and lead to increased muco/bioadhesive poten-tial relative to the unmodified TEOS particles (Djurdjic et al., 2011). Percent of mucoadhesion for organically modi-fied microparticles increased with increased proportion of APTES (55.7% of mucoadhesion for MP3).ConclusionThe addition of precursor APTES modifies the mor-phology of silica microparticles, resulting in increased par-ticle size, drug loading efficiency, muco/bioadhesive poten-tial and 5-FU release rate compared to TEOS based parti-cles. Mucoadhesive potential, burst release and dissolution rate for organically modified particles varied accordingly to the percent of APTES.ReferencesChourasia, M.K., Jain, S.K., 2003.

Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* kago@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionPeriodontal disease is chronic inflammatory disorder, believed to be generally caused by pathogenic microorgan-isms colonising the toot surface, amongst which the most popular are Actonobacilius actinomyycetem comitans, Bacteroides forsitus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, etc.,  be-ing ~75% GRAM- anaerobic type. This disease affect the structural organs supporting the teeth, causing gingiva de-tachment from the tooth and periodontal pockets forma-tion as an ideal ecological niche for the bacteria prolifera-tion. Doxycycline (DOXY) is a wide spectrum antibacte-rial, bacteriostatic drug, effective against the aerob-/anaer-obic type of GRAM+ and GRAM- bacteria as well as pro-tozoa. It is a member of the tetracycline group, which is frequently used in dental treatments due to matrix metal-lo-proteinase- inhibitory effect and strong activity against periodontal pathogens (Tamimi et al., 2008). DOXY is al-most completely absorbed in duodenum with a bioavail-ability of more than 80% with an average of 95%, and half-life of absorption is 0.85\u00b10.41h.Various drug delivery systems have been trailed in periodontitis treatments, such as fibres, gels, injectable systems, micro-spheres/particles, strips, compacts, films, and nanoparticles (NPs) (Raheja et al., 2013). Use of the later was found advantageous over the others due to their size allowing penetration in extra- and intracellular areas, such as gingival fluid, bacterial cells, from the gingival sul-cus to the underlying connective tissue and to periodon-tal pocket areas below the gum line, being otherwise hard-ly accessible by different systems (Segundo-Pinon et al., 2000). Variety of materials have been proposed for drug-NPs  processing; the important biomimetic merits of par-ent biopolymer (the biocompatibility and presence of mul-tiple functional moieties) makes the gelatin (GEL) NPs ef-fective delivery vehicles to be applicable for diverse thera-peutics (Khan and Schneider 2013). By this respect, presented study examines the applica-bility of nanoprecipitation as preferable methodology for DOXY-enriched GNPs processing. The variations range of processing factors, being selected within primary, trial-er-ror experiments (i.e. the pH of GEL solution, DOXY con-centration and EDC/NHS concentration) were established with utilization of \u02ddone factor each time\u02dd experimental ap-proach. The limiting factor in all cases was drug/biopoly-mer precipitation. The influence of processing and formu-lation factors upon the particle size, drug content and en-capsulation efficiency were estimate for processed formu-lation using MODDE software- generated experimental design. Chemical modification (crosslinking degree) and (in vitro) dissolution behaviour of selected DOXY-GNP formulation will be also discussed in this paper.Materials and methodsMaterials. GEL type B from bovine skin Bloom 225 (Sigma Aldrich, Germany), Doxycicline hyclate (DOXI) (Tocris, UK), Lutrol F-127 was kindly donated by BASF, Germany. 1-ethyl-3-(-3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodi-imide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Germany. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as received, without additional purification.GNPs preparation. 0.5% w/v GEL/H2O solutions were prepared at 50\u00b0C under moderate stirring for 1h. The S4 PP 210442Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 441 - 442 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationstwo separate solutions were prepared in parallel, and sub-sequently adjusted to pH 7.5 and pH 9.5. 1mL of select-ed solution was added dropwise to 10mL of 7% w/v Plu-ronic F-127 solution in 96% EtOH, latter being vigorous-ly stirred onto magnetic stirred with 700rpm. Addition-al 10mL EtOH were added afterwards, just prior addi-tion of different concentrations of cross linkers (20-25% w/w, relative to gelatin), being dissolved in 1.250 mL de-ionised water just prior experiments. One set of samples were removed from the magnetic stirred, while the other half were subjected to mild stirring for 24h. In parallel with DOXY-free HNPs, the DOXY-loaded one slight modifica-tion of above procedure, by simple mixing of pre- prepared DOXY and GEL solutions in quantities described within experimental design.Characterization. Scanning Electron Microscopy /SEM/ imaging and Differential Light Scattering /DLS/ analysis were performed to evaluate particle size, PDI and aggregation behaviour in different physiological me-dia and particle morphology. Drug content (%), encapsu-lation efficiency (%) and drug release (%) were quantified by optimised HPLC method (according to European Phar-macopoeia 5.0). Uv-Vis Spectroscopy (using tri nitro-ben-zene-sulfonic acid /TNBS/ reagent) and Attenuated Total Reflectance - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy /ATR-FTIR/ method were used to identify the crosslinking efficiency. Dissolution test was performed in relevant (sa-liva-like) conditions (phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 37\u00b0C, hor-izontal mixing) using cellulose ester- based Float a Lyser device (MWCO 100kDa) (at particular time point samples were withdrawn and analysed by HPLC means and Uv-de-tection /254nm/ of DOXY component).Results and discussionPhysiologically stable drug-free, as well as DOXY-enriched GNPs were successfully processed by optimised nanoprecipitation method, where EDC/NHS chemis-try was introduced in final processing phase. This chem-ical stabilization results in up to 70% crosslinking degree, identified by means of NH2 group\u2019s reduction. Due to the presence of suitable chemical moieties and their respec-tive pKa values, we assume that cross-linking occur not only between GEL molecules, but also between GEL and DOXY, and potentially, between the GEL and the Pluron-ic F-127.  DOXI chemical \u02ddarrestment\u02dd was found to af-fect its dissolution profile, which, for particular formula-tion was estimate to 35% in 24 h period. Moreover, we observe significant effect of processing conditions, i.e. the mixing of DOXY-GNPs dispersions after nanoprecip-itation influence on their aggregation behaviour, giving a clue for more complex interactions within examined, mul-ticomponent system.Resulting DOXY- integrated GNPs where visualised mainly as individual, spherically shaped NPs in 150-240 nm size range, while, relatively high encapsulation effi-ciency (up to ~40%) and drug content (25%) were identi-fied for selected factors combination.ConclusionDOXY-enriched GNPs may be further applied as sin-gle formulation or included in other delivery system (e.g. Guided Tissue/Bone Regeneration /GTR, GBR/ mem-brane) and used in periodontal disease treatment. Nanopre-cipitation methodology can be further explored in process-ing of GNPs as carriers of different types of drugs, thus serving as a processing platform for facile, yet controlled engineering of drug delivery carriers.AcknowledgementThis work was financially supported by the ERAS-MUS MUNDUS mobility program- Join EU-SEE>PENTA (Action 2).ReferencesKhan, S.A. and Schneider, M., 2013.

In the first line of production are includ-ed the most used radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging, such as: [18F] FDG; Na18F; [13N] NH3; [11C] Choline and 68Ga labelled somatostatin analogs.Pharmacological approach of the PET radiopharma-ceutical drugs \u2013 first line of production of The University Institute for PET of Republic of Macedonia[18F] FDG[18F] FDG is the most widely used PET radiopharma-ceutical in clinical practice, especially in oncology, neu-rology and cardiology, providing functional information based on tissue metabolism. This radiopharmaceutical is a structural analogue of 2-deoxy-D-glucose labelled with positron-emitting isotope 189F in the position 2 of the glu-cose core structure. Widespread use of [18F] FDG is based on the principle of \u2018metabolic trapping\u2019 in the cancer cells.After intravenous administration, [18F] FDG through the bloodstream is distributed into cells with the same mechanism as plasma glucose. It is actively transported into the cell mediated by a group of structurally related glucose transport proteins (GLUT). Tumor cells have an overexpression of GLUT compared to a normal cell, and therefore the uptake of [18F] FDG is increased. When the [18F] FDG is transported in the cells, it is phosphorylat-ed in [18F] FDG-6-phosphate under the catalytic action of hexokinase and it remains metabolically trapped intracel-lularly, because [18F] FDG-6-phosphate is not a substrate for glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, the enzyme that me-tabolizes glucose (Scott et al., 2012).The accumulation of [18F] FDG in the malignant cells generally is proportional to the metabolic activity of the cancer cells, which enables their detection by the PET scanner. [18F] FDG is non-specific cancer radiopharma-ceutical. Increased accumulation of [18F] FDG occurs in processes such as inflammation, infection, especially sar-coidosis, tuberculosis, fungal infections, and pneumonia (Jacobson et al., 2012).Normally increased accumulation of [18F] FDG is ob-served in the brain because the glucose is the main ener-gy source for the brain. Also very important is the concen-tration of glucose in the blood of the patient and it should be evaluated prior to administration of [18F] FDG. The in-creased concentration of blood glucose causes elevated levels of insulin, which increases biodistribution of [18F] FDG in muscle and adipose tissue (Lindholm et al., 1993).[18F] Na18F[18F] Na18F PET/CT is diagnostic tool for imaging benign and malignant bone diseases. Fluoride ions are in-corporated into the bone matrix at the bone surface pref-erably in sites of newly mineralizing bone, such as during growth, infection, malignancy (primary or secondary), af-ter trauma or during inflammation. The initial [18F] Na18F distribution represents blood flow that varies among different bones. Almost all deliv-S4 PP 211444Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 443 - 444 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsered [18F] Na18F is retained by bone after a single pass of blood. The uptake of fluoride ions is better in osteoblastic processes, while purely osteolytic processes have a low-er uptake or even no uptake at all. [18F] Na18F is rapid-ly cleared from plasma and excreted by the kidneys. The target organ is bone, but approximately 20% is excreted through the kidney in the urine in the first 1-2 hours (Cz-ernin et al., 2010).[13N] NH3The main clinical application of [13N] NH3 radiophar-maceutical is assessment of myocardial perfusion in pa-tients with suspected or known coronary heart disease.Following intravenous injection, [13N] NH3 rapidly clears from the circulation. It is taken up mainly by the myocardium, brain, liver, kidneys, and skeletal muscle. [13N] NH3 is extracted from the capillaries through the ammonia transporter. The accumulation in tissue is in pro-portion to blood perfusion of the tissue.In the cells, it is converted to glutamine and can diffuse out of the cell or be metabolized to glutamate and retained within the cell. [13N] NH3 undergoes a five-enzyme step metabolism in the liver to yield [13N] Urea, the main cir-culating metabolite, which is eliminated from the body by the urinary excretion (Adeva et al., 2012).[11C] Choline  [11C] Choline is radiopharmaceutical for oncological PET imaging of tumors which overexpress choline kinase. Result of overexpression of choline kinase is increased lev-el of phosphorylcholine by accumulation of free choline for cell membrane synthesis. [11C] Choline is accumulated preferentially within prostate cancer tissue, for that reason the most important application of this radiopharmaceutical in clinical practice is in visualization of this type of tumor. [18F] FDG is not first choice in visualization of the tumors in pelvis area, because of the low uptake, related to low-er expression of glucose transport proteins and to the huge [18F] FDG urinary excretion (Lodi et al., 2012).The maximal tumoral[11C] Choline uptake is related to primary tumor stage (Reske et al., 2006).After intrave-nous administration, the peak of uptake is reached by five minutes and the activity is retained over the subsequent 30 minute scanning period. The distribution of [11C] Choline is mainly to the pancreas, kidneys, liver, spleen and colon. The major metabolite detected in blood is [11C] Betaine (Roivainen et al., 2000).68Ga labelled somatostatin analogs: [68Ga] DOTATOC, [68Ga] DOTANOC and [68Ga] DOTAT\u0410\u0422\u0415The use of [68Ga] DOTATOC, [68Ga] DOTANOC and [68Ga] DOTAT\u0410\u0422\u0415 radiopharmaceuticals for visual-ization of neuroendocrine tumors is based on high affinity of the biological ligand to somatostatin receptors (SSTR). Natural somatostatin has low metabolic stability, therefore synthetic analogues with high affinity for SSTR and resis-tant to enzymatic degradation are developed. (Velykian, 2014).[68Ga] DOTA SST analogues show a rapid localiza-tion of the target site, fast blood and renal clearance. Ra-dioactive metabolites are not detected in serum or urine af-ter 4 hours. The maximum accumulation of activity in the tumor is reached 70 \u00b1 20 min after injection. Excretion is almost entirely by the kidneys.ConclusionThe mapping of the radiopharmaceutical distribution in vivo provides images of functional morphology of or-gans in a non-invasive manner and plays an important role in the diagnosis of many common diseases associated with the malfunctioning of organs in the body as well as in the detection of certain type of cancers (IAEA, 2006).ReferencesAdeva, M.M., Souto, G., Blanco, N., Donapetry, C., 2012.

Cyril and Methodius\u201d, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* idukovska@gmail.comDefinition of a cosmeticThe human need for improvement of the physical appearance is in constant increase year after year. This is revealed by various types of tests and ongoing market research. Hence, the production, the application and the consumption of products for personal hygiene as well as cosmetic products for care, protection and enhancement of the beauty are becoming more and more popular among large number of consumers.  A cosmetic product is classically defined as any preparation that is applied to the skin, eyes, mouth, hair or nails for the purpose of cleansing, appearance enhancement, protection and/or for pleasant smell. Unlike drugs, which are used for treatment or prevention of a disease in the body, cosmetics are not considered to change or affect the body\u2019s structure or functions. However, the distinction between drugs and cosmetics is sometimes not well defined. In spite of the considerable safety of and the high skin tolerance for the cosmetic products, adverse effects still occur from their use, which might be a result from the use of an inappropriately chosen product. Most often these adverse effects are of small or medium intensity and appear usually on the skin (Evaluation of the Cosmetics and Explosives Directives, 2007; Regulation (EC) N0 1223/2009). The research subject of this work is cosmetovigilance, which refers to a series of defined actions that have the purpose of revealing, estimating, monitoring, recording and preventing the potential undesirable reactions that appear as a consequence of the application of a cosmetic product. The concept of cosmetovigilance is recently added to the European Regulation for cosmetic products.  It is a form for objective monitoring of the unwanted effects of the cosmetic products, which are of public health interest. In contrast to the monitoring carried out by the industry, the aim of which is the safety of its own market for commercial purposes, cosmetovigilance has strictly medical aim (Vigan and Castelain, 2014).The European regulationThe European resolution (ResAP (2006)1) from 2006 laid the foundations of the cosmetovigilance system which is based on the reports from the recorded cases. The European Regulation (EU) 1223/2009 for cosmetic products, which was officially introduced on 11 July 2013, requires from all manufacturers to appoint a responsible person who would constantly monitor and record the implementation of the cosmetovigilance for the products available on the market. From 2013 onwards, the new European regulation demands that the serious undesirable effects which are reported to the competent authority to be also delivered to the competent authority of the other member states as well as to the responsible person for a certain cosmetic product in the company. The regulation for cosmetic products primarily addresses the safety of the products that are used by large populations of healthy consumers. However, the efficacy and the safety of cosmetic products are not reviewed or approved by national competent authorities before they are sold to the public. The identification and the analysis of the adverse effects related to cosmetic products is a process that is still to a large extent industry-driven. It is a manufacturers\u2019 responsibility to determine that the product and its ingredients are safe before they are put on the market. Moreover, manufacturers have the responsibility of collecting the reports for all the recorded adverse effects. Although manufacturers do their best to ensure safety of their products, it should be taken into consideration that a potential conflict of interests is always present (Moretti and Velo, 2008).The aim of this work is to present the implementation of the cosmetovigilance system in the countries in Europe S4 PP 212446Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 445 - 446 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsand how it is employed in practice. Also this work would attempt to resolve two major problems: evaluation of the causes and the types of reports. At the same time it would present data gathered from conducted studies the aim of which was to estimate the appearance of adverse effects from the use of a cosmetic product, utilizing different methods for their detection, monitoring and prevention, as well as establishing a standard cosmetovigilance system.Causality assessmentThe definition of causality assessment is slightly different for French Health Products Safety Agency (AFSSAPS) and European Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery association (Colipa). For AFSSAPS, causality \u201cassesses the cause and effect relationship between a cosmetic product and a specific clinical and/or paraclinical manifestation\u201d (2010). Causality must be established for each product individually. For Colipa \u201cCausality assessment is particularly useful when the same product is involved in the occurrence of several cases of undesirable effects, when it makes it possible to determine the extent of a link of cause and effect between the cosmetic product and the undesirable effects observed and then to take these effects into account in the subsequent drawing-up of corrective measures such as investigations, recommendations on the proper use of the product, or regulations at national or European level (restrictions on use, warnings on packaging labels, limited concentration or prohibition) (Zweers et al., 2012).Several methods have been published. They are based on the analysis of evolving chronological and semiological elements. The results of relevant tests or of re-challenge tests can alter causality, for instance as regards contact allergy; appropriate patch testing provides a certain degree of causality. The AFSSAPS method is based on 6 criteria, divided into two groups, which are used to calculate a chronological score and a semiological score. The level of causality is determined using a decision table in which the scores are combined. The method has five levels of causality assessment: very likely, likely, not clearly attributable, unlikely and excluded. The causality assessment method by Colipa is based on three major criteria: symptomatology, chronology and results of specific tests. This method offers 3 levels of causality on the basis of a decision tree in which these criteria are combined: questionable, likely and very likely. Another method uses a flow chart as soon as the case has been reported, following a PLM (product lifecycle management) call approach. It is also based on chronological and semiological criteria and all the notifications can be analysed using 6 levels: irrelevant, not enough information, unlikely, possible, probable and certain. (The SCCPS notes of guidance for the testing of cosmetic ingredients and their safety evaluation, 2006).The cosmetovigilance system is the right means of obtaining information on the safety of cosmetic products and their ingredients. It can be used by the competent authorities in Europe, which would confirm that the new directives ensure a high level of safety. Cosmetovigilance makes it possible to exclude and control potentially hazardous ingredients which are included in the product content, and thus develops the costumers\u2019 trust and reassures them about the safety of the products available on the market.ReferencesEvaluation of the Cosmetics and Explosives Directives, Final Report (Cosmetics), 2007.

GDP regulates the division and movement of pharmaceuti-cal products from the premises of the manufacturer of me-dicinal products, or another central point, to the end user thereof, or to an intermediate point by means of various transport methods, via various storage and/or health estab-lishments.The wholesale distribution of medicinal products is an important activity in integrated supply chain management. Today\u2019s distribution network for medicinal products is in-creasingly complex and involves a lot of people from dif-ferent professional profiles. The GDP Guidelines establish appropriate tools to as-sist wholesale distributors in conducting their activities and to prevent falsified medicines from entering the le-gal supply chain. Compliance with these Guidelines will ensure control of the distribution chain and consequently maintain the quality and the integrity of medicinal prod-ucts (GGDP, 2103).The GDP Guidelines are intended to be applicable to all persons and outlets involved in any aspect of the stor-age and distribution of medicines from the premises of the manufacturer of the product to the person dispensing or providing medicines directly to a patient or his/her agent. This includes all parties involved in trade and distribution of medicines, including the manufacturers of bulk, finished products, wholesalers, as well as others such as suppliers, distributors, Government institutions, international pro-curement organization, logistic providers, traders, trans-port companies and forwarding agents and their employees as well as health workers. The main parts of GDP are: 1) Organization and management; 2) Quality management; 3) Personnel; 4) Equipment and premises; 5) Documentation; 6) Operations; 7) Outsourced activities; 8) Self inspections and 9) Transportation. In fact, the parts mentioned above form the GDP network. They interfere between each oth-er forming a complex system in order to provide quality assurance that ensures that the quality of pharmaceutical products is maintained through adequate control through-out the numerous activities which occur during the distri-bution process. Every part of the GDP system is important to maintain the quality of the distribution chain. Regarding Organization and management, an adequate organizational structure for each entity in the chain of distribution should be defined with the aid of an organizational chart. The aim of this organizational chart is to have a clear view of the duties and responsibilities of each person involved in the process (GGDP, 2103; WHO, GDP, 2005).Every individual involved in the process of distribu-tion should have a written job description and at every lev-el of the supply chain, employees should be fully informed and trained in their duties and responsibilities.Training should be based on written standard operat-ing procedures (SOPs). Personnel should receive initial and continuing training relevant to their tasks, and be as-sessed as applicable, in accordance with a written training program.The system for managing quality should encompass the organisational structure, procedures, processes and re-sources, as well as activities necessary to ensure confidence that the product delivered maintains its quality and integri-ty and remains within the legal supply chain during storage and/or transportation. The quality system should be ful-ly documented and its effectiveness monitored. All qual-ity-system-related activities should be defined and docu-mented. A quality manual or equivalent documentation ap-proach should be established. A responsible person should S4 PP 213448Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 447 - 448 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsbe appointed by the management, who should have clear-ly specified authority and responsibility for ensuring that a quality system is implemented and maintained.This responsible person is designated by the whole-sale distributor and should meet the qualifications and all conditions provided for by the legislation of the Member State concerned. A degree in pharmacy is desirable. The re-sponsible person should have appropriate competence and experience as well as knowledge of and training in GDP (GGDP, 2103; GGDPBP, 2012).Besides the responsible person there should be an ade-quate number of competent personnel involved in all stag-es of the wholesale distribution activities of medicinal products. The number of personnel required will depend on the volume and scope of activities. Wholesale distributors must have suitable and ade-quate premises, installations and equipment, so as to en-sure proper storage and distribution of medicinal products. In particular, the premises should be clean, dry and main-tained within acceptable temperature limits.Different medicines require different storage condi-tions. There are medicines that should be stored following the cold chain regime and medicines that should be stored on room temperature, 2-8 \u00b0C and 15 -25 \u00b0C respectively (Com-mission Directive 2003/94/EC, 2003; WHO, GDP, 2005).Equipment and processes should be respectively quali-fied and/or validated before commencing use and after any significant changes, e.g. repair or maintenance.There are a lot of SOPs (standard operative proce-dures) that determine every step of the processes that are conducted during the reception, storage and dispatch of the medicines.All actions taken by wholesale distributors should en-sure that the identity of the medicinal product is not lost and that the wholesale distribution of medicinal products is performed according to the information on the outer packaging. The wholesale distributor should use all means available to minimise the risk of falsified medicinal prod-ucts entering the legal supply chain.Also in compliance with the GDP standard qualifica-tion of the supplier and costumers must be done.Regarding the situations that can occur after the pa-tient has received the medicines, there must also be a SOP on how to handle a complaint from the costumer as well as a SOP for medicines that are returned for some reason.In order to provide a continuous quality management system, self-inspections must be conducted in an impartial and detailed way by designated competent company per-sonnel. Audits by independent external experts may also be useful but may not be used as a substitute for self-in-spection.The transportation of the medicines is a very impor-tant part of the distribution process, that is why the person-nel in charge of transportation must be trained how to op-erate with the medicines that should be distributed and the vehicles involved in the process must be suitably calibrat-ed and mapped as well.Considering all the facts mentioned above a con-clusion can be made that the Good Distribution Practice (GDP) system is a very important tool in order to provide a better medicine quality regarding distribution factors and an improved health care system as well, which will con-tribute for a higher safety of the patients (Commission Di-rective 2003/94/EC, 2003; GGDP, 2103).ReferencesGGDP, 2103.

The principal identification strat-egies are based on macro- and microscopic analysis, com-plemented by phytochemical methods. The methods are defined in national and supranational pharmacopoeias. Be-sides these methods, identification by DNA sequences is in fast development and supplements classical methods in difficult matrices like e.g. powdered roots or even extracts (Novak et al., 2007). The DNA-sequence as tool to identify speciesThe sequence of the nucleotides in the DNA (\u2018DNA sequence\u2019) is unique for each individual. However, re-lated individuals share their DNA sequence to a big ex-tent and the closer the relationship the higher the degree of sequence consensus. With a well-defined set of refer-ence samples, mutations in short DNA pieces can be iden-tified that are variable between taxa (e.g. species) but sta-ble within the taxon. Based on these informative muta-tions, unknown samples can be assigned to a specific tax-on (Kress et al., 2005). Right now, it is not possible to eval-uate and compare the whole genome of each sample with each other in cheap and fast routine analysis. Therefore, routine methods are developed based on small informative sequence parts, which are mostly in the size range of a few hundred base pairs.Since molecular biology has very wide application area from biology to medicine and forensics the develop-ment of new technologies is very fast. Therefore, also pos-sible molecular biological methods for identifying medic-inal plants and biological contaminations in plant material are numerous as exemplarily listed below: \u2022\t Hybridization-based methods (examples: dynam-ic allele-specific hybridization, molecular bea-cons, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mi-croarrays)\u2022\t Enzyme-based methods (examples: restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), PCR-based methods (e.g. amplification refractory mu-tation system (ARMS))\u2022\t Post-PCR methods based on physical properties of the DNA (examples: Single strand conforma-tion polymorphism, denaturing HPLC, high-reso-lution melting of the entire amplicon (HRM), use of DNA mismatch-binding proteins, SNPlex)This presentation will focus on a few methodological examples, namely DNA sequencing, ARMS and HRM. \u2018Classical\u2019 DNA sequencing (Sanger sequencing)The \u2018classical\u2019 DNA sequencing delivers complete sequence information of short DNA pieces (amplicons). Comparing a sample sequence with the reference sequenc-es (e.g. with phylogenetic methods), the sample can be identified (Kress et al., 2005). However, the classical as-sessment by DNA sequencing is still time-consuming and relatively expensive, a fact that can be overcome by oth-er DNA-based methods better suitable for routine analysis. Amplification-Refractory Mutation System (ARMS)One method is the ARMS in which alternative PCR primers are developed in a way to bind only to the infor-mative mutation (Little, 2001). Therefore, a PCR-product is only obtained if the primer fits to the desired mutation. S5 \u041eP 214452Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 451 - 452 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsIn gel electrophoresis following PCR, the presence or ab-sence of the PCR product can be detected. This method was used to identify Valeriana officinalis increasing rou-tine efficiency by combining several PCR reactions in one tube (Ruzicka et al., 2016).High-Resolution-Melting-Analysis (HRMA)Another method is HRMA. The principle of this meth-od is the separation of the two DNA-strands (\u2018melting\u2019 of the DNA) by slowly increasing the temperature at high-ly constant rates (\u2018high-resolution\u2019). The \u2018melting\u2019 can be measured by the decreasing intensity of a fluorescence dye intercalating the DNA resulting in a melting curve that is specific for a DNA sequence (Ruzicka et al., 2016). The el-egance of this method besides its reliability in measure-ment is that the fluorescence measurement takes place im-mediately after PCR in the same machine and in the same tube as the PCR reaction. Sample manipulation is therefore limited to a minimum, which makes this method especially attractive for routine analysis (Schmiderer et al., 2010, Ru-zicka et al., 2016). Another aspect of medicinal plant qual-ity control is adulteration. HRM can be also used to de-tect adulterations in complex mixtures (Mader et al., 2011, Schmiderer et al., 2015).ConclusionIn the last years, many different methods to identi-fy medicinal plants using different technology were de-veloped and their stability and efficiency proofed. There-fore, the way is open to consider them for their inclusion in pharmacopoeias as official testing methods in order to sup-plement classical identification methods in difficult species or matrices.ReferencesKress, W.J., Wurdack, K.J., Zimmer, E.A., Weigt, L.A., Janzen, D.H., 2005.

The focus of the ADSI is on the hit-to-lead development, toxicology and \u201cmode of action\u201d studies in vitro. Focused libraries of natural or synthetic compounds are tested using an innovative high-content screening (HCS) approach that allows for the reliable identification of bioactive compounds or natural products. Development of screening modelsThe main goal is on the development and uses of in vitro assays where cultivated cells have similarly to the patient\u2019s tissue in vivo. These in vivo-like in vitro models are used for the high-content screening of focused libraries of natural or synthetic compounds. Automated microscopy, multiplexing readouts, metabolomics and proteomics allow the detection of molecules of interest, their changes during incubation with active substances and give a hint on the \u201cmode of action\u201d of particular substance in biological pathways. Primary cell co-culture systems in vitroThe use of human primary cell based culture systems provides for more predictable and clinically relevant results that facilitate new insights into the biology and cellular processes in the presence of tested compounds. Primary cells have much more delicate growth requirements and are often more sensitive to toxic agents than long-term cell lines. Synthetic and natural compounds are typically screened for toxicity with high-throughput assays that utilize tumor cell lines and simple endpoints like cell death or inhibition of cell proliferation. Although these methods have allowed the screening of huge numbers of compounds, many of the lead compounds screened by such practices have experienced late drug failure due to unacceptable toxicity in the clinic. In our hands, functional assays using primary cells from particular tissues deliver more predictive data on efficacy and actual toxic effects on the given tissues and organs than assays using cultured tumor cell lines. Toxicity tests developed in the ADSI enable early detection of potential side effects before the lead compounds reach pre-clinical tests in animal models. Following cell culture systems using human primary cells are available: mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), MSC derived adipocytes, MSC derived skeletal muscle myotubes, primary hepatocytes, monocytes and macrophages. Laboratory automationRobotics and automation are applied in an appropriate manner to achieve maximal information gain from a single experiment. Continuous monitoring with state-of-the art analytical and optical methods enables measurement of multiple cellular parameters modified by test substances including cell communication and transmission of signals. 3D cell culture The pharma and biotech industry recognizes the importance of moving from 2D cell culture towards 3D tissue culture platforms to increase the in vivo relevance S5 \u041eP 215454Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 453 - 454 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsof in vitro-based assays for drug discovery. Synthetic hydrogels constitute the first choice to cultivate cells in a 3D environment when high levels of versatility, reproducibility and biological relevance are requested. Thanks to the possibility to engineer desired physical and biochemical properties, these hydrogels are capable of supporting the growth and differentiation of a wide range of cell types and tissue models in 3D. The Automated Screening Assay Platform was developed in order to automate cellular and tissue culture assays for 3D-cell-assay analyses in a time-resolved manner. 24/7 automation is achieved using robotic plate handling system, enabling users to schedule multiple runs of up to 40 cell culture plates in 96-well format. Metabolomics, secretomics and proteomicsThe analytical division focuses on the identification of compounds and pathways causing or mediating the biological activity in the cellular test systems. Advanced liquid chromatography separation techniques coupled to mass spectrometry provide the basis for analyses of test substances by means of metabolomics and proteomics approaches. Separation of samples is performed using analytical and preparative UPLC-systems either directly hyphenated to detection systems, sample spotters (MALDI-analysis) or fraction collectors. Mass spectrometry is used for the detection of small molecules by means of untargeted metabolomics in supernatants of cell co cultures, as well as in context of secretomics (proteins in cell supernatants) and or proteomics (proteins in cell lysates). Data mining and detailed analysis of acquired data facilitate the identification of compounds and pathways causing or mediating the biological activity in the cellular test systems. Biostatistics & bioinformatics All described biological and analytical methods produce huge amounts of raw data that have to be analysed properly. Acquired raw data from all systems are stored in the databank for further analyses. Biological and analytical data are processed using sophisticated biostatistics & bioinformatics tools and are then combined into comprehensive data sets providing reliable basis for the selection of drug candidates for later stages of drug development. Extraction & fractionation ADSI developed an expertise in the systematic variation of extraction procedures that allows for the development of pharmacologically active substance mixtures, such as plant extracts, that are optimized for their content of pharmacologically active ingredients. The fractionation of the samples using chromatographic techniques allows the rapid isolation of molecules of interest and the elucidation without dilation of their chemical structure. Special extraction procedures and chemical analytics allow optimization of the pharmacologically active substance mixtures in plant extracts. Further tailor-made assays and analyses are under development according to the demands of customers.ReferencesADSI - Austrian Drug Screening Institute Ltd, 2016. http://www.adsi.ac.at/en/analytics/phytoneering/ (accessed on 22.03.2016).Oral presentationsMacedonian pharmaceutical bulletin, 62 (suppl) 455 - 456 (2016)ISSN 1409 - 8695UDC: 615.322.074:543.51Short communicationThe application of mass spectrometry and pathway analysis in understanding the biochemistry of medicinal plantsShaun Bilsborough1* and Zoran Nastov2 1Agilent Technologies, Cheadle Royal Business Park, Stockport, SK8 3GR, United Kingdom 2Farmahem, Kicevska 1, 1060, Skopje, R. Macedonia* shaun_bilsborough@agilent.comIntroductionMass spectrometry profiling is used to determine the changes occurring in a biological system in response to dif-ferent conditions in order to better understand aberrations in the biochemical pathways involved (Rojo et al., 2012). The same methodology can be applied to the understand-ing of the biochemistry of plants that show medicinal prop-erties (Avula et al., 2014). When the investigation focuss-es upon the small molecule level, then different methods, mass spectrometry platforms and analytical conditions are required due to the various chemical properties of the com-pounds of interest, leading to numerous data files for each biological replicate. More recently, the application of hy-phenated techniques such as ion mobility have led to bet-ter separation of complex biological samples while the ad-ditional dimension has added another level of complexity to the data generated (May et al., 2015). Once the identi-ty of metabolites of interest has been determined, a critical requirement for the understanding of the biochemistry is the ability to map results directly to biochemical pathways (Bhat et al., 2014).  In this presentation, an overview of the analytical and software requirements will be discussed to-gether with the application of biochemical pathway anal-ysis in the interpretation of complex data sets, which can lead to a better understanding of the biology of medicinal plants.Material and methodsCompounds were extracted through maceration of plant material in 50% (v/v) methanol:water. Samples were then filtered to remove the plant material and the extract-ed compounds separated directly into a 6550 quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer using a 1290 ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent Tech-nologies). The compounds were ionized by both electro-spray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and spectra acquired in both positive and negative ionization mode. An Eclipse Plus C18 column (2.1 mm x 150 mm; 1.8 um) was used for the separation with a lin-ear gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water against 0.1% for-mic acid in acetonitrile starting from 2% to 98% over 20 minutes at a flow rate of 250 \u03bcL/min. The resulting data was initially extracted using MassHunter ProFinder using batch recursive feature extraction and comparative analy-sis then performed using MassProfiler Professional. Sig-nificant, reproducible changes detected were identified us-ing the METLIN PCDL. The results were then visualized by mapping onto biochemical pathways using MassHunt-er Pathway Analysis.Results and discussionA comprehensive approach to LC/MS analysis using ESI and APCI ionization and both positive and negative ac-quisition together with cross-platform investigations, such as GC/MS, significantly increased coverage of the metab-olome. The addition of ion mobility separation further in-creased coverage through an orthogonal separation method based upon collision cross section of each compound. How-ever, this approach also produced a high volume of data and complexity to the investigation. Initial recursive batch ex-traction of the data files allowed significant data reduction while also improving the quality of the data that was then used for biological profiling. The extracted features were initially aligned and normalized followed by hierarchical clustering to check the reproducibility of biological repli-cates. Significant and reproducible differences between test S5 \u041eP 216456Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 455 - 456 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsgroups were determined by analysis of variance, principal component analysis and fold-change filtering. The result-ing features were identified and annotated onto biochemical pathways to aid visualization. This was facilitated by the METLIN database of metabolites (Scripps Institute) local-ly installed on the instrument computer, which also allowed smaller subset databases to be generated based on the me-tabolites involved in biochemical pathways of interest. This provided an advantage in allowing such subset databases to be used for targeted data extraction of the metabolites in-volved in the pathways. These metabolites belonged to en-ergy, fatty acid, amino acid, nucleotide, and secondary met-abolic pathways. Multi-omic correlation analysis between genomic and metabolomics technologies allowed the iden-tification of co-regulated entities, such as genes and me-tabolites involved with amino acid, carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism. Such a multi-omic approach provided ad-ditional evidence of important pathways and increased un-derstanding of specific pathways in the production of com-pounds of medicinal relevance.ConclusionLC/MS provides a reproducible, accurate method of analyzing complex samples to determine the compounds present. The challenge is in the interpretation of the high volume of complex data generated. Recursive batch ex-traction, biological profiling and pathway analysis allowed the data generated to be converted to knowledge in the form of identified metabolites, but more importantly, that knowledge could then be utilized to provide understanding of the important underlying biochemical pathways through pathway analysis.ReferencesAvula, B., Cohen, P.A., Wang, Y.H., Sagi, S., Feng, W., Wang, M., Zweigenbaum, J., Shuangcheng, M., Khan, I.A., 2014.

Macedonia: present situationGjoshe Stefkov*, Ivana Cvetkovikj, Marija Karapandzova, Svetlana KulevanovaInstitute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University \u201cSs Cyril and Methodius\u201d,  Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* gstefkov@yahoo.comIntroductionCannabis or hemp (fam. Cannabinaceae) has three main types:  C. sativa, C. indica, and C. ruderalis. It is a matter of divided opinion whether the genus consists of one or more species. Cannabis  plants  contain  at  least  489 distinct compounds distributed among 18 different chem-ical classes  including  cannabinoids,  nitrogenous com-pounds,  amino  acids,  proteins,  enzymes,  glycoproteins, hydrocarbons,  simple  alcohols,  aldehydes,  ketones  and acids,  fatty  acids,  simple  esters  and  lactones,  steroids, terpenes,  non-cannabinoid  phenols,  flavonoids,  vitamins, and pigments  (Hillig and Mahlberg, 2004).Nowadays, the pharmacologically active substance in cannabis - cannabinoids, comprises more than 70 differ-ent phytocannabinoids, with potentially significant appli-cations in medicine and pharmacy. The principal cannabi-noids appear to be delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (i.e. \u22069-THC, THC), cannabinol (CBN), and cannabidiol (CBD). Other cannabinoids found in cannabis are cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and many others.Therapeutic properties of cannabis have been known since ancient times and have been a source of fiber, food, oil, medicine, and inebriant substances. There are signif-icant health benefits associated with the consumption of seeds and its derivatives, due to its well-balanced fatty acid spectrum and high value proteins. The therapeutic appli-cations of cannabis and its derivatives have been studied by various world bodies, including the Scientific Commit-tee of the House of Lords in Great Britain (1998), the Insti-tute of Medicine in the United States (1999) and the Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs in Canada (Abramov-ici, 2013). In order to assess the current knowledge on the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, a meta-analysis has been performed through Medline and PubMed up to July 1, 2005. Seventy-two controlled studies evaluating the ther-apeutic effects of cannabinoids were identified. Research studies have clearly shown that cannabinoids are highly ef-ficient, primarily in the treatment of nausea and vomiting and the management of chronic pain. For patients who suf-fer from severe, chronic diseases, such as cancer and AIDS, cannabis has been shown to relieve several symptoms at the same time in more efficient way than some registered medicines. Besides, there is a great potential of cannabi-noids to be applied for the treatment of many other path-ological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheim-er\u2019s disease, spinal cord injuries, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, ep-ilepsy, hypertension, glaucoma, although it is necessary to complete the last phases of clinical trials in order to regis-ter these compounds as drugs, and to assure safe therapy for these diseases (Ben Amar, 2006).Cannabis is a well-known drug and a controlled sub-stance, which possession and use are illegal in most coun-tries of the world. Nowadays, the use of cannabis and its le-galization for medical use has become a worldwide trend. Laws and attitudes toward cannabis are changing these days. Legalization of cannabis use for medical purposes is a hot topic at the global level and in most countries there have been initiatives to amend the existing laws in order to make drugs based on natural ingredients of cannabis, as well as other related products, synthetically produced, available to patients (Sarmento et al., 2015).Therefore, due to the increased global necessity of re-search on the cannabis and for the sake of reinforcing the ability of the R. Macedonia to respond to the challenges arising from this issue, we have started a study for chem-ical characterization of various cannabis products, mainly cannabis oil, as well as plant material from indigenous and foreign origin.S5 \u041eP 217458Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 457 - 458 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsMaterials and methodsDry overgorund parts, leaves and buds, from wild growing Cannabis sativa L., Cannabinaceae (tentative identification) were collected in central east part of R. Macedonia (RM), during two vegetative seasons, in 2014 and 2015. Additionally, coarsely grounded dry leaves and buds of Cannabis indica L., Cannabinaceae (tentative identification) obtained by donation from patient for scien-tific-research purposes were used. Cannabis oil (CO): various samples were obtained by donations from patients for scientific-research purposes.0.1 g dry plant material or oil were dissolved in 10 mL n-Hexane and placed in ultrasonic bath for 15 min. After-word were filtrated through disposable Econofilter 25/0.45 \u03bcm RC pore size and injected in the GC system.Standard substance solutions were made by dissolv-ing standards of THC and CBD into methanol in following concentrations: 0.05 mg/mL and 0.02 mg/mL, respectively.Samples were analysed with an Agilent 7890\u0410 Gas Chromatography system with FID detector and Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer. HP-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25 \u03bcm) was used. Adams\u2019 analytical method was used prolonged for 10 min at the end (Adams, 2007). The components were identified by comparing the mass spectra of components present in the samples with refer-ence spectra obtained from NIST, Wiley and Adams\u2019 mass spectra libraries. Quantification of the THC and CBD was done according corresponding standard substances.Results and discussionIn the analyzed samples (CO and dry plant) the follow-ing six cannabinoids were identified: THCV, CBD, CBC, THC, CBG, CBN and delta-6-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03946-THC). Five terpenoids compounds (\u03b1-pinene, camphene, limonene, trans-E-caryophyllene and germacrene B) were also detected with percentage share 1-6%. THC and CBD were predominant cannabinoids in all analyzed samples. Two types of samples can be distinguished: type 1-high in THC (73-95%) and low in CBD (0-16%) and type 2- low in THC (2-4%) and high in CBD (48-84%). The analysis of the wild growing cannabis from RM, revealed low THC (3.02-4.13%), followed by CBC (4.48-6.88%) and high CBD content (72.30-73.73%), thus can be classified as type 2. On the contrary, C. indica plant sam-ple was classified as type 1, appearing to be high in THC (86.38%) and low in CBD (0.71%). The relative abun-dance of these and other cannabinoids can vary depending on a number of factors such as the Cannabis strain, the soil and climate conditions or the cultivation techniques. The content of THC in the indigenous cannabis was (0.159-0.587%) and 19.23% in C. indica. Quite the opposite the CBD content varied from 3.11-7.22% in the wild growing cannabis and 0.122% in the C. indica plant sample. From an average of 2 151 samples collected in Europe between 2006 and 2008, the average concentration of THC found was 0.075% (Sarmento et al., 2015). The analysis showed that most of the CO belongs to type 1 and the content of THC and CBD is very close to the distinguished percent-age share.Recently, changes of the Law for narcotic substances in RM were made concerning legalization of cannabis for medicinal and scientific purposes, in a way of cultivation, production of cannabis medical preparations as well as im-port of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, containing canna-bis or cannabinoids.ConclusionDue to the legal constraints on the possession and use of cannabis, relatively little research on the medicinal qual-ities of this plant has been conducted. Recently, due to the changes of the Law for narcotic substances in RM, an op-portunity, for starting a scientific-research work on this plant and related products, has appeared. Preliminary re-sults of the study for chemical characterization of various cannabis products, CO and cannabis plant material from indigenous and foreign origin are reported.ReferencesAbramovici, H., 2013.

Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) is a valuable source of therapeutic agents and has great historical and socio-economic importance for Republic of Macedonia. The excessive and continuously growing need for natural alkaloids from opium poppy was the main reason to launch a project for reviving the growth and utilization of opium poppy in Republic of Macedonia.One of the goals of this project is to increase the ultimate yield of opium poppy alkaloids. The production of opium poppy in Macedonia is mainly based on local landraces and one commercial cultivar. The need to improve existing germplasm became apparent in the recent years. Consequently, the renewal and upgrade of the poppy breeding program was necessary. The first step was to establish a germplasm collection out of which promising lines could be selected. The genotypes in the starting collection should be grouped according to their characteristics. Therefore, analyses of the genetic diversity among poppy landraces and breeding lines from Macedonia and introduced poppy genotypes based on various morphological traits and determination of the extent of genetic diversity for proper utilization in the breeding program were performed (Ivanovska et al., 2012; Jankulovska et al., 2012, 2013; Stefkov et al., 2012). The overview of the advancements in the newly established opium poppy breeding program is presented.Materials and methodsThe field experiments were performed every year (2010-2015) near Skopje in R. Macedonia. Each year, number of genotypes decreased as a result of positive selection. During the vegetation different growth stages were observed, as well as the morphology of the genotypes. The agro-morphological characterization and assessment of the genetic diversity of opium poppy genotypes was based on 11 quantitative and 10 qualitative traits. Agro-morphological traits were described according to UPOV descriptor (1999). The GC/FID/MS and the HPLC/DAD analysis were performed on poppy straw methanolic extracts, obtained by optimized ultrasonic agitation, for determination of the content of six alkaloids: morphine, S5 \u041eP 218460Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 459 - 460 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationscodeine, thebaine, oripavine, papaverine and noscapine (Acevska et al., 2012a, 2012b). Principal component (PCA) and cluster analyses (CA) were applied for variation evaluation of the most important quantitative characters. Positive selection of genotypes with desirable traits was continuously conducted (Ivanovska et al., 2012; Jankulovska et al., 2012, 2013; Stefkov et al., 2012). Results and discussionThe pattern of morphological and productive variation between all accessions was evaluated through the qualitative (shape of capsule base, capsule ribbing, shape of capsule, capsule dehiscence, shape of stigmatic disc, surface of lobes, shape of lobes apex, seed color, petal color, petal base color) and quantitative (plant height, number of capsules per plant, number of stigma lobes, diameter of stigmatic disc, diameter of capsule, length of capsule, weight of main capsule, weight of seed of main capsule, seed yield per plant, capsule yield per plant, total yield per plant) characters. The analyzed opium poppy collection expressed broad variability for all investigated traits. Principal component (PCA) and cluster analyses (CA) served as effective tools for identification of genotypes with a combination of positive characteristics. The most variable traits were seed yield per plant and number of capsules per plant. Extraction procedure (liquid extraction using methanol as an extraction solvent, under reflux and ultrasonic agitation) followed by HPLC/DAD were developed and optimized for fast screening and in same time accurate assessment of the content of six alkaloids in the poppy straw samples using design of experiments (DoE). Chemical characterisation of the samples revealed high variability in the alkaloid content between the analyzed genotypes e.g.: morphine (0.07-1.65%); codeine (0.01-0.66%); thebaine (0.05-0.17%); oripavine (0.001-0.07%); papaverine (0.007-0.62%); noscapine (0.005-0.63%).The starting germplasm collection represented a good basis for successful selection of promising opium poppy lines with a combination of high seed and capsule yield as well as high alkaloid content.ConclusionThe characterization of opium poppy germplasm revealed high variability among the evaluated genotypes considering agromorphological traits and alkaloid content. Genotypes which expressed high seed and capsule yield per plant and high morphine content were successfully identified. These genotypes will be considered for variety registration and production in R. Macedonia.References\u0410cevska, \u0408., Stefkov, G., Petkovska, R., Kulevanova, S., Dimitrovska, A., 2012.

Cyril and Methodius\u201d, Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy,  Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* marijakarapandzova@yahoo.comIntroductionIn the public\u2019s mind, the word \u201cdietary fat\u201d has be-come synonymous with obesity and heart disease. Conse-quently, as nuts are typically high in fat, they are tradition-ally avoided in an attempt to low blood cholesterol and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, there is increasing evidence that diets that include nuts may elic-it cardio protective effects (Ryan et al., 2006). Different heath studies reported that women who consumed nuts five or more times a week have a 35% lower risk of total CHD compared with women who rarely eat nuts (Hu et al., 1998) and strongly support the link between consumption of nuts and the reduced risk of heart disease (Albert et al., 2002; Fraser et al., 1992). Additionally, several clinical studies have evaluated the effect of diets high in nuts on blood lipids level. In a randomized controlled study, Sabate et al. (1993) reported that men on nut diet had a 12% and 16% decrease in total and in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, respectively, compared to normal diet. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of nut consumption ob-served in epidemiological and clinical studies underscore the importance of distinguishing different types of fat and have long established that the type of fat, but not the total amount of fat, predicts serum cholesterol levels. Although, nuts are high in fat, the predominant types are \u201chealthy or good fats\u201d such as mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids which lower the LDL cholesterol and hence the CHD risk (Hu et al., 2001).In many cultures, pine nuts are traditionally used as in-gredients in sauces, pastries or in desserts and are added to savory foods. The main species consumed in Europe are Pinus pinea, Pinus koraiensis, Pinus sybirica and Pinus gerardiana (Destaillats et al., 2011). Nowadays, very little is known about the consumption of pine nuts from Mace-donian species probably due to the lack of data related to their chemical composition as well as fatty acids profile. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine to-tal oil content and fatty acid composition of these conifers nuts in order to obtain any information that will help to dis-close their possible usage.Materials and methodsPlant materials (pine nuts) of two pine species (Pinus peuce and Pinus nigra) were collected from two localities in R. Macedonia (Pelister and Berovo, respectively). Be-fore oil extraction, plant material was dried and properly homogenized.A known weight of sample (30 g) was extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus using petroleum ether as a solvent for 36 hours. After isolation, the samples were evaporated to re-move residual traces of petroleum ether (Trajkovic et al., 1983). Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared from extracted oil with potassium hydroxide in methanol ac-cording to method described by Trajkovic et al. (1983) and were analyzed on Agilent 7890\u0410 Gas Chromatogra-phy system equipped with FID detector and Agilent 5975C Mass Quadrupole detector. For that purpose, HP-5ms cap-illary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 \u03bcm) was used. Operating conditions were as follows: oven tem-perature at 60 \u00b0C (2 min), 10 \u00b0C/min to 200 \u00b0C (2 min) and 5 \u00b0C/min to 240 \u00b0C (7 min); helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; injector temperature 250 \u00b0C and that of the FID detector 250 \u00b0C. One \u03bcl of each sample was inject-ed at split ratio 1:1. The mass spectrometry conditions were: ionization voltage 70 eV, ion source temperature 230 \u00b0C, transfer line temperature 280 \u00b0C and mass range from 50 - 500 Da. The S5 \u041eP 219462Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 461 - 462 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsMS was operated in scan mode.Identification of FAME was made by comparison of their retention times and mass spectral data with those ob-tained from standards and from Nist, Wiley and Adams mass spectra libraries. The percentage ratio of FAME was computed by the normalization method of the GC/FID peak areas without any correction factors.Results and discussionThe content of total oil isolated from pine nuts of Macedonian species yielded from 32.61% to 38.56% in nuts of Pinus nigra and Pinus peuce, respectively.Data analysis of the chemical composition of exam-ined oil samples revealed three different classes of fatty ac-ids: saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The last one was dominant fraction in both species (65.25% in nuts of Pinus peuce and 58.65% in nuts of Pinus nigra), while the fraction of saturated and monounsaturat-ed fatty acids were present in smaller amount (7.15% and 26.10% in Pinus peuce and 14.70% and 25.56% in Pinus nigra, respectively). Total of 21 fatty acids were identified in the investigat-ed oil samples isolated from Pinus peuce nuts which rep-resented 97.79% of total oil. The most abundant fatty acids were linoleic acid (61.95%) which is classified as polyun-saturated \u03c9-6 fatty acid and oleic acid (24.98%) known as monounsaturated \u03c9-9 fatty acid. Palmitic acid (3.51%) was dominant in the class of saturated fatty acids. Similarly 28 fatty acids were identified in the oil samples isolated from nuts of Pinus nigra which represented 98.60% of total oil. Predominant fatty acids were the same linoleic (54.81%), oleic (22.80%) and palmitic acid (9.07%).In terms of data concerning the chemical composi-tion of oil isolated from pine nuts, only one study could be found regarding chemical composition of fatty oil isolated from black pine or Pinus nigra but still there is no avail-able published data about the composition of oil obtained from nuts of Pinus peuce or Macedonian pine. According Bagci and Karaagacli (2004), the oil isolated from nuts of black pine from Turkey contains linoleic (47.10%), oleic (17.80%) and palmitic acid (4.70%) as major constituents what correlates to our findings.ConclusionSummarizing the obtained results, it is evident that pine nuts collected from Macedonian species are rich in oil that contain significant amount of unsaturated \u03c9-6 as well as \u03c9-9 fatty acids thus could be considered as their potential source. Moreover further investigations of chem-ical composition should be made in order to provide more data for their possible medicinal, pharmaceutical or com-mercial utilization.ReferencesAlbert, C.M., Gaziano, J.M., Willett, W.C., Manson, J.E., 2002.

They are organic bases with aliphatic (putres-cine (Put), cadaverine (Cad), spermine (Spm), spermidine (Spd)), aromatic (tyramine (Tyr), phenylethylamine (Phe)) or heterocyclic (histamine (His), tryptamine (Trp)) struc-tures, can be classified as monoamines (Phe and Tyr), di-amines (His, Cad, Put) or such as volatile (Phe) and non-volatile (His, Cad, Put, Tyr, Spm, agmatine (Agm), Trp) biogenic amines. The main factors for formation of bio-genic amines in foods or fermented foods are following: the availability of free amino acids, the existence of de-carboxylase positive microorganisms and the presence of suitable pre-conditions that allow bacterial growth. Pres-ent in higher concentration in foods, poses health risk for sensitive peoples and are cause for a number of adverse ef-fects on human health such as rash, edema, headache, ur-ticaria, rhinitis, respiratory and digestive problems (Lade-ro et al., 2010). Some pharmacological effects of biogen-ic amines which have appropriate precursors are: liberates adrenaline and noradrenaline, stimulates both sensory and motor neurons, controls gastric acid secretion (histamine); increases the cardiac output, causes lacrimation and saliva-tion, increases respiration (tyramine); hypotension, depre-ciation of the wine aroma, potentiate the toxicity of other amines (putrescine and cadaverine); releases noradrenaline from the sympathetic nervous system, increases the blood pressure, causes migraine (phenylethylamine) etc. (EFSA, 2011; Shalabi, 1996). During wine production biogenic amines are already present in must obtained from sunny or rotten grape, be-cause from vineyard it is not possible to get grape which will be free of biogenic amines (Gloria et al., 1998). Addi-tionally the biogenic amines are accumulated during fer-mentation, from yeast (alcoholic fermentation) or bacteria (malolactic fermentation) or from other naturally present microorganisms. According to that, the wines where the amino acids are present are ideal environment for produc-tion of biogenic amines. The negative influence of biogen-ic amines on human health is the reason why the world with high velocity works on detection and determination the level of biogenic amines in different foods and wines. Although, different methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) are usually used for sep-aration and detection of biogenic amines in foods, ferment-ed foods and wines, the aim of this study is to develop and optimise the HPTLC method for qualitative and quantita-tive analysis of five biogenic amines in few red and white wines as an alternative method with several advantages. Materials and methodsSamples and chemicals: A total 12 wine samples (six red wines and six white wines) were collected from differ-ent winery and different aging period for determination of five biogenic amines. All chemicals and reagents were ana-S5 \u041eP 220464Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 463 - 464 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationslytical grade. The hydrochloride forms of biogenic amines were used as standards and purchased from Sigma, Merck and VWR from Germany. Stock solution of His, Cad, Put, Phe and Tyr dissolved in 10% EtOH was prepared (500 ppm) and then for determination of calibration curve were prepared standard biogenic amines solutions: 0.1 mg/L; 0.5 mg/L; 1 mg/L; 5 mg/L; 10 mg/L; 15 mg/L in which 1.6 diaminohexan was added as internal standard. Preparation of wine samples for HPTLC analysis: liq-uid-liquid extraction of biogenic amines from wines was made by following procedure: 5 mL of wine sample was mixed with 1 mL 5 M NaOH and 2 mL 5 M Na2CO3. Af-ter that were added successively three times butanol (6 Ml + 3 mL + 3 ml), and upper butanol layer was segregate and mixed 4 min. with 5 mL 0.1 M HCl. Separated lower layer was derivatised as followed: 200 \u03bcL sample was mixed in plastic tubes (2 mL) with 400 \u03bcL Dansyl chloride (50 mg/ 10 mL acetone) and 200 \u03bcL NaHCO3 (1.5 g/ 10 mL H2O). Derivatisation was conducted at 60 \u00b0C on dark place for 60 min. and after that in sample was added 500 \u03bcL toluene. The above layer was separated and put in vials for automat-ic ATS4 application of the sample on the HPTLC plate. For elution of biogenic amines was used 10 mL mobile phase: Toluene:Chloroform:Trietylamine (10:6:5 by volume) and 0.5% Tween 80. Saturation time was 40 min. at room tem-perature, on dark, avoiding air movements. Overall elution time was 20 min. Instrumentation and conditions: HPTLC plates pre-coated with silica gel 60F254 (20 cm x 10 cm) from Merck (Germany) were used as the stationary phase. The samples were sprayed on the HPTLC plate (spray-on technique) with the help of a sample applicator AUTOMATIC TLC SAMPLER 4 (ATS4, CAMAG). The chromatogram was developed in horizontal developing chamber (CAMAG). Detection of components from developed HPTLC plates was made with fluorescence Vilber Lourmat detector. Ob-tained chromatograms were analyzed by software packag-es Infinity 15.01 and Tina.Results and discussionBiogenic amines are of increasing interest to the wine industry due to proposed regulatory issues. Although HPTLC technique is relatively simple, it is difficult to make directly separations of biogenic amines from com-plex wine matrix. For effectively separation of biogenic amines and solve the problem with effect of wine matrix into qualitative and quantitative routine analysis two deri-vatisation agents FMOC-CL (9-fluoroenylmethyl chloro-formate) and DAN-CL (dansyl chloride) were investigat-ed.  After derivatisations and liquid-liquid extraction, bio-genic amines in wine samples were simultaneously anal-ysed by using CAMAG ATS 4 automatic sampler on pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 plate and Vilber Louromat fluo-rescent detector. After analysis of obtained results was con-cludes that second development derivatisation and modifi-cated liquid-liquid extraction protocol allowed effectively HPTLC separations and identification of biogenic amines in complex wine (red and white) matrix in concentration from 0.1 to 15 \u03bcg/mL. Results of analysis shown that all red wine samples had higher level of  biogenic amines than white wines. The validated method displayed excellent se-lectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and ro-bustness.ConclusionAccording to the known literature data, analysis of bio-genic amines by HPTLC method in wines has been used for the first time in Republic of Macedonia. The optimised HPTLC method compared with HPLC is less expensive for routine analyses of wines and enables reducing the use of organic solvents for derivatisation and for mobile phase, and provides an opportunity for determination of biogen-ic amines without higher interference with the compounds from the complex red or white wine matrix. In conclusion, the proposed HPTLC method is suitable for application in analysis of biogenic amines in differ-ent wines and could be considered as an alternative meth-od and an important tool in routine analysis of biogenic amines in wine.

Recently, there has been a considerable interest in extracts and essential oils from common culinary herbs, spices and aromatic plants with established antimicrobial and antioxidant potency. Among all, some representatives of the Lamiaceae family (oregano, marjoram, savory, sage, rosemary, thyme, basil ect.), possessing high polyphenols content and vol-atile compounds, are often used to prevent different meet products from food born microorganisms or to stabilize fat and fat-containing foods. The direct addition of spices to food is the most com-mon technological method, in order to improve its taste, smell and organoleptic effect, to increase the freshness of products and at least to preserve the products in a proper way (Kostic-Nikolic, 2013). However, these days numer-ous efforts have been made to find alternative solutions to the aim of avoiding undesirable inactivation, and adultera-tion of the smell and taste. Spraying, dipping, and coating treatment of food with active natural principles are current-ly applied to product prior to packaging as valid options (Ahmed and Ismail, 2010). Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the us-age of some Lamiaceae spices and its respective prepara-tions and formulations as natural preservatives in treatment of processed meat products, as well as developing novel technological formulation (active packing) to maintain the food quality and to prolong their shelf-life.Materials and methodsDry leaves of Salvia officinalis and Rosmarinus offici-nalis were purchased from Herbal Pharmacy-Alkaloid AD, Skopje. Dry leaves, essential oils (EO) and dry extracts (wa-ter, alcoholic) were prepared according to the methods list-ed in the monographs in the European pharmacopoeia or in the Cvetkovikj et al. (2013) paper, and added in differ-ent meet products (minced meat, kebabs, and sausages) as preserving agents. The different plant preparations were chemically char-acterized by Agilent HPLC-DAD and HPLC\u2013DAD\u2013ESI-MSn to examine the polyphenols and for the volatile com-pounds characterization Agilent GC-FID-MS system was used. Chitosan/sodium-triphosphate/pectin microparticles containing extract from sage were prepared using spray drying technique (B\u00fcchi B-290, Flawil, Switzerland).Microbial strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Clos-tridium sporogenes ATCC 19404, Escherichia coli ATCC 25992, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 and clinical S5 \u041eP 221466Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 465 - 466 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsisolates from patients (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonel-la enteritidis) were used. Disc diffusion (the zone of inhibition was determined, expressed in mm) and disk dilution (the minimal inhibi-tory concentration-MIC was determinate) methods were used in order to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the preparations. To assess the antioxidant potential of the plant prepa-rations and formulation, \u03b2-carotene linoleic acid assay was performed according to Wettasinghe and Shahidi (1996), with small modifications, while the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test for secondary products of lipid oxidation sug-gested by Tarladgis et al. (1960), and modified by Shahidi et al. (1987) was used.Results and discussionWith HPLC\u2013DAD\u2013ESI-MSn qualitative analysis of the extracts were performed and 27 different compounds were detected. The identified compounds were classified in four groups: nine hydroxycinnamic acid derivates, 10 flavone glycosides of luteolin and apigenin, two flavanone glycosides of hispidulin and six phenolic diterpenes, deri-vates of carnosol. Rosmarinic acid was predominant com-pound, present with more than 40% in the analysed sam-ples. On the other hand, the ratio of the flavanone glyco-sides and the phenolic diterpenes was almost equal.The EO yield was 1.65% and complies with the min-imal requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia. With GC/FID/MS in total 32 constituents were detected. The identified compounds were classified in three groups: ox-ygenated monoterpenes (68.76%), followed by the mono-terpenes fraction (12.91%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (7.36%). The sesquiterepene fraction and the diterepenes were detected in amounts < 3.00%. As principal EO con-stituents were considered: camphor, 1,8-cineole, cis-thu-jone, trans-thujone, camphene and viridiforol. The chem-ical composition of the EO did not comply with the ISO 9909 and GDC standards.The gas chromatographic analysis of the dry extract revealed four different classes of terpenes compounds (ox-ygenated monoterpenes, diterpens, oxygenated sesqutere-penes and sesquterepenes). When compared to the EO it is evident that in the methanolic extracts the highly volatile monoterepenes were not detected. The activity of the preserving additives (dry minced leaves, dry extracts, essential oil and microparticles load-ed with extract) \u2013 was evaluated by the growth inhibition and MIC for food borne microorganisms (four Gram-posi-tive and three Gram-negative bacteria). Generally all addi-tives showed better activity towards Gram-positive bacte-ria that is in accordance with the literature. The most potent antimicrobial activity posses the EO, with lowest MIC (mg/mL) determinate towards five microorganisms (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, L. monocytogenes, E. coli and K. pneumonia) that can be attributed to the presence of oxygenated mono-terpenes (60% of EO), which is in correlation with the on-line available data (Pierozan et al., 2009). The microparti-cles showed antimicrobial activity alike EO. On the other hand, the extract incorporated into mic-roparticles (1 mg/mL), showed strong antioxidant activi-ty thus inhibiting 90% of the oxidation of the linoleic acid compared to the extracts that can be probably attributed to the synergistic action between the dry extract and the formulation properties of the designed carrier system. Ad-ditionally, performing the TBA test, this formulation pos-sesses the potential to protect the product from lipid ox-idation, and to provide longer shelf-life storage with low TBA number (0.2029) compared with the other investigat-ed preparations (Valesco and Williams, 2011).ConclusionDifferent preparations of dry plant leaves from sage and rosemary, showed antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that have potential to be used as natural preservatives for processed meat products. Additionally, novel technological approach was investigated in order to diminish the adulteration of the taste, smell and color on the meat as most common side effect of adding of natural additives. The obtained results suggest that the dry extract incorporated into microparticles can be considered as promising technological solution in preserving food.ReferencesAhmed, A.M., Ismail, T.H., 2010.

However, the actual total flora of Kosovo is estimated to comprise more than 2 500 plant species (Krasniqi, 1998), which accounts for about 30% of the entire Balkan flora and 16% of the European flora, al-though Kosovo covers only 2.3% of the Balkan land area (Mustafa, 1998). The diversity of aromatic plants in Koso-vo isn\u2019t fully known, as up to now no detailed studies were carried in this regard. It is estimated that in Kosovo are present more than 100 aromatic plant species which can serve as a source of essential oils.Materials and methodsThis review focuses on the phytochemical composi-tion of essential oils obtained from wild population of aro-matic plats in Kosovo and on their biological activity (an-timicrobial and antioxidant activity). For that, previously published papers related to the chemical composition of the essential oil originated from Kosovo and their biologi-cal activities were used to produce this review.  Results and discussionSeveral researches on chemical composition and/or their biological activity of the essential oil originated from Kosovo were carried by different working groups. The in-vestigated species  belong to different family as follow: Cupressaceae (Juniperus communis L., J. communis subsp. alpina (Suter) \u010celak and J. oxycedrus L.), Pinaceae (Ab-ies alba Mill., A. borisii-regis Mattf., Pinus mugo Turra, P. peuce Griseb., P. heldreichii H.

Except chemical screening of the essential oil, in the plant species J. communis, J. oxycedrus, Pinus mugo, P. peuce, B. officinalis, S. sylvatica, S. montana, H. perfora-tum, P. terebinthus the chemical variability of the essential oil among different population were analysed too (Hajdari et al. 2012a; 2012b; 2014a; 2014b; 2015). Essential oil ob-tained from the following species: J. communis, P. mugo P. peuce, P. heldreichii, P. sylvestris, P. nigra, T.s longicaulis, M. albanica and P. terebinthus were tested for their antimi-crobial, while essential oil obtained from P. mugo P. peu-ce, P. heldreichii, P. sylvestris, P. nigra were tested for their antioxidant activity too. In scientific aspect the most inter-esting analysed taxa for their essential oils are M. albanica and A. alexandri-regis, which are local endemic of Koso-vo and are characterized with limited population size.

During preparation these remedies are repeatedly diluted and vigorously shaken at each stage of dilution. Their final potency is described in decimal (D) or centesimal (C) scale of dilution. There are low, medium and high potencies within each scale, while all D potencies are weaker then C potencies. Though, opinions on categorization of potencies may differ, potencies up to six are generally considered low potencies (6D or 6C). Classical homeopathic treatment involves taking a history of the case and a detailed examination. It differs from conventional treatment since it uses principle of treating the whole patient rather than individual symptoms. Improvement is seen as bothering symptoms are diminished or absent and patient reports more energy, better sleep and mood. Benefits of using homeopathic remedies are multiple: they are not teratogen, non-toxic and do not produce side effects, in acute cases they act faster than conventional drugs, they may be effective in the cases where conventional medicine has nothing to offer, their shelf-life is very long and possible unlimited, they are well tolerated by patients of all ages, their application is not invasive in conditions where swallowing is difficult (e.g. vomiting, coma, epilepsy) and they have very low cost (Vithoulkas, 2008).There are two main approaches in use of homeopathic remedies \u2013 the use of single remedy made in single potency and only of one substance (classical homeopathic remedies) and the use of several substances in different potencies combined together in such a way to cover specific disturbing symptoms (complex homeopathic remedies). In both situations the use of homeopathic remedies may or may not be associated with the use of conventional, mostly chemical drugs. This paper discusses specificity of these approaches within Serbian settings.  In classical homeopathy whole patient is treated by taking in account his mental (e.g. disposition, attitude etc.), general (e.g. tolerance to coldness, heat, damp, wind etc.) and particular or peculiar symptoms (worse from movement, better by hard pressure, throbbing pain, pulsating pain, etc.). This information helps determine one homeopathic remedy that is prescribed in one potency, in a posology that is adjusted to the individual patient\u2019s health state. This remedy may be so compatible with constitution of the patient that outcome is amelioration or complete disappearing of the troubling symptoms, while at the same time patient feels better on a general level. That is the main aim for patients that choose homeopathy\u2013 either because the conventional medicine has failed to help them or they prefer it as the gentlest way of healing during acute or chronic ailments.Complex homeopathy, on the other hand, tries to bridge classical homeopathy and conventional medicine offering partial benefits of both. A complex homeopathic remedy, made of  several different substances, all in low potencies and combined with the aim that each is targeting different symptoms, can be used independently of a homeopathic consultation \u2013 either by advice of a conventional doctor, a pharmacist or as a part of self-medication. Complex homeopathic remedy of different content may be commercialized under a brand name and can undergo research that proves its efficacy (Thinesse-Mallwitz et al., 2015). A complex remedy cannot offer constitutional healing to the patient, but one of its benefits is that it attempts to achieve clinical efficacy in cases when a classical homeopathic consultation is not available (Malapane et al., 2014). Still, many classical homeopaths never prescribe complex homeopathic remedies. Their negative attitude is based on the premise that use of complex homeopathic medicine compromises effects of classical prescribing and spoils the case.S5 PP 223470Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 469 - 470 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsHomeopathic remedies, either classical or complex, can be used in conjunction with conventional medicine, although their action may be less effective in that case due to the difference in the mechanism of action. Homeopathic medicine acts on body\u2019s auto regulatory mechanisms. If these have already been influenced by powerful drugs, the action of homeopathic remedy may be impaired. However, in the case of the maintenance therapy for deficiency diseases (e.g. insulin, thyroxine, etc.) conventional medicine must not be discontinued during the homeopathic treatment. A homeopathy is an effective additional form of therapy, but in a multi-medicated patient it should be used with high doctor\u2019s prudence and experience.There are several specificities in homeopathy in Serbia. One-component remedies for classical homeopathy are not imported and readily available in pharmacies since they are not registered. Patients self supply themselves in a difficult manner - mostly from abroad (Cupara et al., 2013). Moreover, legislation and education of homeopaths are roughly regulated and there are practical inadequacies. Many homeopaths due to the above mentioned problems have small volume of consultations on annual level, which consequently lead to less experienced practice. There is a lack of competent structural information about practitioners and patients have obstacles in choosing and reaching a homeopath. The additional difficulty is the self-medication that patients practice, which is also a driving force for unjustified use of many conventional drugs, even in a case when a proper pharmacist\u2019s advice is given. In this specific situation, in which patient cannot easily reach a competent homeopath of his choice or cannot easily obtain the prescribed remedy, together with tendency for unjustified self medication by conventional drugs and slow, but steadily growing number of patients that require alternative to conventional drug, a complex homeopathic remedy seems to be a possible choice that harms the least.ReferencesCupara, S.M., Djordjevic, V., Jakovljevic, M.B., 2013.

Cannabis has an extremely long history of use. Although cannabis is indigenous to Central and South Asia, it spread all over the world very early in human history. While humans in Taiwan were growing hemp as early as 8 000 BCE, the historical use of cannabis as a physical and psychological medicine began over 5 000 years ago. Therapeutic properties of cannabis have been known since ancient times, although the application has been limited mainly due to narcotic characteristics of this plant. Cannabis is also known as marijuana and numerous other street names such as ganja, pot, astro turf, grass, hemp, dagga, kiff, weed, hash, purple, etc. Hashish is related form of the drug made from the resins of the Indian hemp plant. Also called chocolate, shit or hash, it is on average six times stronger than marijuana (Mikuriya, 1969).Nowadays, the pharmacologically active substanc-es in cannabis - cannabinoids, are very interesting group of compounds with potentially significant applications in medicine and pharmacy. Research studies have clear-ly shown that cannabinoids are highly efficient, primarily in the treatment of nausea and vomiting and the manage-ment of chronic pain. For patients who suffer from severe, chronic diseases, such as cancer and AIDS, cannabis has been shown to relieve several symptoms at the same time, in more efficient way than some registered medicines. Be-sides, there is a great potential of cannabinoids to be ap-plied for the treatment of many other pathological condi-tions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, epi-lepsy, hypertension, glaucoma, although it is necessary to complete the last phases of clinical trials in order to reg-ister these compounds as drugs, i.e. in order to assure the safe therapy for these diseases (Grotenhermen and Russo, 2002). Although tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) proved to be very efficient in the treatment of numerous diseases, new drugs have been intensively developing that tend to possess improved selectivity, better pharmacokinetic properties, and favorable relationship between desired pharmacolog-ical effect and side effects. Laws and attitudes toward can-nabis are changing these days. Legalization of cannabis use for medical purposes is a hot topic at the global level and in most countries there have been initiatives to amend the ex-isting laws in order to make drugs based on natural ingredi-ents of cannabis, as well as other related products, synthet-ically produced, available to patients, that would certainly, based on the results of investigations, contribute to a better quality of patients\u2019 lives (Clark et al., 2004). On the other hands, there is a question: \u201cIs cannabis addictive?\u201d What would be a proper answer? Cannabis, like other analgesics, can cause dependence and addiction. Over time, the per-sistent overstimulation of the endocannabinoid system can cause changes in the brain that result in addiction. This is much more likely in people who start using cannabis (mar-ijuana) when young and who are heavy users. An estimated 9% of people who use cannabis become dependent on the drug. Teenage users have a 17% risk of becoming addicted, and 25-50% of regular, daily, users become addicted. Short term effects of cannabis are both pleasant and unpleasant and short term cannabis effects are not the same for ev-eryone. Short term cannabis effects vary depending on the person\u2019s size, experience with the drug, the amount of drug consumed and individual physiology. Desirable short term effects of cannabis are generally characterized as \u201chigh\u201d. Pleasant short term cannabis effects include: euphoria, in-toxication, relaxation, detachment, decreased anxiety and S5 PP 224472Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 471 - 472 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsalertness, altered perception of time and space, intensified experiences, laughter, talkativeness. However, while those short term effects of cannabis are pleasant, short term ef-fects of cannabis also include: depression, anxiety, panic, paranoia, amnesia, confusion, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, mania, short term memory impairment, sudden increase in heart rate, at risk for heart complications, diz-ziness, lack of coordination and muscle strength, lethargy, decreased concentration, slurred speech. It is also known that mental illness and cannabis use are linked, particularly to schizophrenia, but at this time it\u2019s not clear whether can-nabis causes, exacerbates or is simply a predictor of men-tal illness. Even the short term effects of cannabis can in-clude an increase in the severity of existing mental illness-es. Long term effects of cannabis tend to be more negative than the short term effects. This is primarily because toler-ance builds to the drug\u2019s effects and the user takes great-er doses of cannabis, increasing the short and long term ef-fects of cannabis as well as its potential for abuse. Once tolerance to the drug is achieved, one of the long term ef-fects of cannabis becomes cannabis withdrawal after us-ing it and during periods of abstinence (http //www.drug-freeworld.org/drugfacts/marijuana/short-and-long-term-effects.html). The withdrawal syndrome begins on the sec-ond day of stopping and may persist for two weeks. Dis-continuation symptoms include anxiety, irritability, insom-nia, stomach pain and decreased appetite. Sleep problems can potentially persist beyond that time frame. Cannabis is an illicit drug that has the potential to lead to abuse and ad-diction. Despite the commonly held belief that herbal can-nabis is harmless, its use is not without adverse effects and undesirable outcomes. The full extent of long-term health risks of chronic cannabis use is currently unknown. It is also important to note that \u201csynthetic cannabis\u201d is not ac-tually cannabis (http://www.addictions.com/marijuana/). There are many research projects that are examining the medical benefits of individual cannabinoid chemicals de-rived from or related to those in the marijuana plant, not the plant itself, although a few use unprocessed plant mate-rial. Individual cannabinoid chemicals may be isolated and purified from the marijuana plant or synthesized in the lab-oratory, or they may be naturally occurring (endogenous) cannabinoids found in the body and modified using other, non-cannabinoid chemicals (Boyd, 2013).ReferencesBoyd, W.J., 2013.

As huge di-versity of bean varieties and landraces are cultivated at the Balkan countries, this region is considered as second-ary centre of origin. Cooked bean\u2019s seed is traditional dish in Macedonia and although the white seeded varieties are more popular, farmers also preserve landraces varied in shape, size, color and pattern of seeds. This valuable diver-sity is passed through generations for more than two centu-ries (Ivanovska et al., 2013; Maras et al., 2009).Lately, the trend of balanced diet essential for healthy life is increasing and the consumption of many agricultur-al crops is recommended. In this sense, bean is considered as healthy food due to its nutritional and health benefits (Mesina, 2014). Its main nutritional component is starch, predominantly consisted of amylose and amylopectin. The specific ratio of these two polysaccharides along with the slow digestion of amylose raises blood sugar more gradu-ally and keeps it lower, compared to other types of starch. Thus, bean ranks very low according to the glycemic in-dex and is beneficial particularly for diabetics (Barrett and Udani, 2011; Hutchins et al., 2012). Beans are one of the richest sources of plant proteins, out of which widely stud-ied are phaseolin, lectins and protease inhibitors. In partic-ular, they are among the only plant foods that provide sig-nificant amounts of the indispensable amino acid lysine. It also contains insoluble fibers alpha-galactosides that cause flatulence in some individuals and substantial quantity of resistant starch which may be used in weight control. Both substances are fermented in the colon by beneficial bac-teria, stimulating their growth and function as prebiotics. Beside, as a result of the fermentation short-chain fatty ac-ids are formed, such as butyrate, acetate and propionate that may reduce the risk of colon cancer (Havenaar, 2011). Beans are also rich in various vitamins and minerals, like molybdenum, vitamin B9, iron, copper, manganese, potas-sium, vitamin K1 and phosphorus. Other positive bioac-tive compounds of beans are the antioxidants isoflavones, known as phytoestrogens (Konar et al., 2012) and antho-cyanins found in the colored seed coat (Lin et al., 2008). Bean also contains negative compounds such as phytic acid (found in all edible seeds) which reduces the absorp-tion of minerals and can be eliminated by soaking and fer-menting the beans, and a toxic lectin phytohaemagglutinin which is eliminated with cooking (Queiroz et al., 2002).Beside its nutritional value, several studies have linked bean consumption with reducing the LDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure, as well as the risk of overweight and obesity (Papanikolaou and Fulgoni, 2008), metabolic syndrome and ischemic heart disease (Mesina, 2014). As starch blockers are completely inactivated when seeds are boiled at 100 \u00baC for 10 min., they are extracted from raw white kidney beans and sold like a weight loss supplement (Grube et al., 2014).Having all this in mind the aim of this study was to explore the existing bean diversity in Macedonia starting with creation of a landrace germplasm collection. Further on, they will be tested for different plant characteristics in-cluding their nutritive value. The final goal of this initiative is to promote bean consumption in everyday diet and to ex-plore the potential of different landraces as raw material for production of supplements.Materials and methodsIn order to assess the existing bean diversity in Mace-donia, a collection mission was initiated in 2015 by the re-S5 PP 225474Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 473 - 474 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationssearchers of the Department of Genetics and Plant Breed-ing, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences and Food in Skopje. Seed samples of landraces and relevant information were collected in 237 villages from 58 municipalities and pre-served at the Faculty\u2019s Gene bank. Considering that the ac-tivities are continuous, until now a total number of 1025 samples are collected. They will be analyzed in a field ex-periment to eliminate duplicates and to characterize and evaluate the landraces.Results and discussionThe collected 1025 samples belong to three types of beans. Two types are common bean belonging to the spe-cies Phasolus vulgaris L.: ssp. nanus or bush bean (BB) and ssp. volubilis or pole bean (PB). The third one is runner bean (RB) belonging to the species Phaseolus coccineus L. Regarding to the type, distribution of samples is 590 BB, 395 PB and 40 RB, indicating that the last type is facing extinction. The analysis based on seed color only, showed that white seeded beans share 46.9% of the collection with 310 samples of BB, 155 of PB and 16 of RB. Further di-vision for the white seeded beans only has been done ac-cording to the seed shape on 4 general categories: kidney, round, oval and compressed. Highest amount (123) of PB samples was with compressed shape (like the famous local landrace Tetovski grav). Within the BB collection, three types of samples are almost equally distributed: oval (120), kidney (101) and round (79). Out of the 177 samples of mono-colored seeds, landraces with brown seeds prevail (30; 25), followed by cream (19; 30) and green (2; 35) of PB and BB, respectively. Other colors were much less present with 21 black, 10 dark red, 3 dark lilac and 2 dark green-blue seeded samples. A category bicolored seed (26 samples in total) refers to seeds with oval or round shape that have one half white and one half colored seed. In this category, the colored half has various colors and often an additional pattern.The rest of the collected samples (341) belong to the colored seeds with pattern. Many different combinations of size, shape, color and pattern type (speckles, stripes etc.) are registered. Most distributed are cream seeds with dark red or brown speckles, as well as brown seeds with dark brown or black stripes or speckles. If additional categories are added in the analysis in total, like size and shape of the seeds, color and type of the pattern, as well as vegetative characteristics of the plants, it is obvious that diversity of landraces is huge. ConclusionFrom the preliminary analysis of the bean collection based on the seed color only with several parameters it may be predicted that more than 300 different landraces are col-lected. Thus, the collection presents a valuable gene pool which will be further analyzed for all traits according to bean descriptors. Landraces with colored seeds will be par-ticularly promoted for their nutritional and medicinal val-ue.ReferencesBarrett, M.L., Udani, J.K., 2011.

(Asteraceae) extracts on colon colorectal adenocarcinoma  (Caco-2) cell lines\u00d6zge Taran\u00e7\u01311, Selcen Babao\u011flu Ayda\u015f2*, Belma Aslim11Gazi University, Faculty of Science, Department of Biology, 06500, Teknikokullar, Ankara, Turkey.2Gazi University, Vocational High School of Health Services, 06830, Ankara/G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131, Turkey* selcenb@gmail.comIntroductionAdenocarcinomas are the cancer of intestinal gland cells and the representative of more than 95% of colon and rectal cancers. \u201cAdeno\u201d is the prefix for gland and the intes-tinal gland cells that line the inside of the colon and/or rec-tum, where the adenocarcinomas typically start. A reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer is possible although the screening techniques are imperfect (CTCA, 2016).Flavonoids exert their anticarcinogenic effects by modulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, apop-tosis, angiogenesis and metastasis. Flavonoids are proved to be highly effective scavengers of most types of oxidiz-ing molecules, including singlet oxygen and various free radicals, which are possibly involved in DNA damage and tumor promotion (Sandhar et al., 2011). Apoptosis is an important way to maintain cellular homeostasis between cell division and cell death. So, one of the useful strategies for anticancer drug development is the induction of apop-tosis in cancer cells (Kwon et al., 2006).It has been reported by pharmacological trials that some members of the genus Centaurea possess antiinflam-matory, antimicrobial, antipyretic, cytotoxic, and immuno-logical activities (Zengin et al., 2010). The present study was carried out to evaluate the apoptotic and antioxidant effects and to determine the possible mechanisms of cell death elicited by the extracts of Centaurea depressa on hu-man colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2.Materials and methodsPlant material and extract preparationC. depressa was harvested from field in G\u00f6lba\u015f\u0131, An-kara, Turkey. The identification of plant materials was con-firmed by plant taxonomist, Prof. Dr. Zeki AYTAC, at the Department of Biology, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey. A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey. The aboveground tis-sues were shade dried, powdered and 30 g samples were separately extracted with either methanol or water, using Soxhlet apparatus for 6 h and the extracts were filtered and concentrated in rotary evaporator. Cell lines and culture mediumCaco-2 cell lines obtained from ATCC were cultured in DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37 \u02daC with 5% CO2 (Hadjiakhoondi et al., 2013). The cells were planted in microtiter plates at an initial density of 1 x 104 cells/well. After optimum confluence cells were exposed to CME or CWE (500 \u00b5g/mL) as determined to be the effective dose in former antiproliferation experiments for 48 h. Untreated cells were considered as controls.Determination of the total antioxidant capacityCayman\u2019s antioxidant assay was used to determine the total antioxidant capacity. The assay relies on the abil-ity of antioxidants in the sample to inhibit the oxidation of ABTS (2,2\u2019-Azino-di(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-sulphonate) to ABTS\u25cf+ by metmyoglobin. The capacity of the antiox-idants in the sample to prevent ABTS oxidation is com-pared with that of Trolox, a water-soluble tocopherol ana-logue, and is quantified as millimolar Trolox equivalents. The ABTS produced by the cells after the extract treatment were measured according to the kit\u2019s protocol.Determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activityCayman\u2019s superoxide dismutase assay kit was used. The kit utilizes a tetrazolium salt for detection of superox-ide radicals generated by xanthine oxidase and hypoxan-S5 PP 226476Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 475 - 476 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsthine. One unit of SOD is defined as the amount of en-zyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superox-ide radical. The measurements were achieved according to the kit\u2019s protocol.Cell death detection assayApoptosis was determined by a Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS assay. This kit is based on a photometric en-zyme immunoassay and is used to detect DNA fragmen-tation; mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cy-toplasm by biotinylated anti-histone- and peroxidase-cou-pled anti-DNA antibodies, following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The enrichment factor (total amount of apopto-sis) was calculated by dividing the absorbance of the sam-ple (A405) by the absorbance of the controls without treat-ment (A490) which was equal to 1.Detection of apoptosis associated morphological changes with Hoechst 33342.Apoptotic effects of plant extracts were evaluated with Hoechst 33342 staining assay determining the morpholog-ical alterations in the cells. Propidiumiodide (PI) is used to detect the necrotic cells. Cells were imaged with fluores-cence microscope (T\u00fcrk et al., 2011). Apoptotic index was defined as the percentage (%) of apoptotic cells and cal-culated with the formula; number of apoptotic cells / total number of cells x 100 (Jackisch et al., 2000).StatisticsResults are expressed as means \u00b1 Standard deviation (SD). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and means were compared using the Tukey\u2019s test, with P<0.05 considered as statistically significant. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times, with triplicate samples for each treatment.Results and discussionIn our former experiments investigating the antipro-liferation activity of the C. depressa methanol (CME) and water extracts (CWE) in varying concentrations (100, 250 and 500 \u00b5g/mL), the results exhibited a dose dependent trend and both methanol and water extracts showed a sig-nificant antiproliferative activity on Caco-2 cells with 500 \u00b5g/mL concentration (63%, 69% cell death, respective-ly). So this study was carried out to evaluate the apoptotic and antioxidant effects of the extracts and to determine the possible mechanisms of cell death elicited by the extracts of C. depressa (500 \u00b5g/mL) on Caco-2 cell line. Activi-ties of total antioxidant enzymes were analysed using Cay-mans\u2019s kit, however no detectable change were observed as compared with the control cells (0.31\u00b10.02 mM Trolox) (p<0.5). Similar results were also found in the SOD activi-ty (0.8\u00b10.03 U/mL) (p<0.5) and SOD activity also did not vary according to the extract type.Apoptotic effect of CME and CWE (500 \u00b5g/mL) on the Caco-2 cells were determined by cell death detection after 48 hours incubation. Apoptotic effect of the CME and CWE are higher as compared to the control group with the enrichment factor of 1.69-fold and 1.98-fold respectively and the CWE has higher apoptotic effect than CME.Hoechst 33342 staining revealed the morphological changes including cell shrinkage and nuclear condensa-tion occurred with C. depressa; producing a more brighter blue light in apoptotic cells compared to normal cells that showed normal nuclear morphology. Dead cells had violet-red fluorescence and showed no signs of chromatin con-densation and apoptotic bodies. PI dye cannot cross cell membrane of dead cells, as opposed to apoptotic cells. The extracts may have inhibited cell growth via inducing apop-tosis. Therefore apoptotic index was defined as the percent-age (%) of apoptotic cells stained with Hoechst 33342 dye and the results indicate that CME and CWE exhibited sig-nificant high apoptotic index following 48 hours treatment in favor of CWE (47% and 60% respectively).ConclusionC. depressa exhibited considerable apoptotic effects on Caco-2 cancer cell lines. Studies investigating the bio-active ingredients of these herbal extracts would pave the way for mechanistic and translational studies in efforts to design novel anticancer drugs to be used alone or concom-itant with other therapies to prevent progression of tumors and/or to treat them.ReferencesCancer Treatment Center, 2016. http://www.cancercenter.com/colorectal-cancer/types/ (accessed on: March, 2016).Hadjiakhoondi, F., Ostad, S.N., Khanavi, M., Hadjiakhoondi, A., Farahanikia, B., Salarytabar, A., 2013.

Fam. Cannabi-naceae) is very popular nowadays because of its medical use. The plant Cannabis sativa L. is a source of a number of drug products. Marijuana represents the dried top parts of female hemp plant in flower. The main ingredient in hash-ish is the resin secreted by the glandular hairs found all over the plant but mainly around flowers. In addition, the cannabis plant can be used as a source hemp fibers, as well as hemp seeds and fatty oil (Kovacevic, 2000). Throughout human history cannabis has been used for many purposes such as recreation, therapy, art, religion, food, medicine, as a textile. This plant was also used for treating insomnia, healing and also as painkiller. Each culture and subculture from prehistory up to now use this plant because it causes selective changes in consciousness of its consumers strict-ly dosing what is beyond reality, and also for medical rea-sons. Today, cannabis is forbidden in many countries be-cause of its narcotic and negative influence to the nerve system. In some cultures cannabis is a protected mark, oth-er cultures are its big admirers and third do not know or do not look on that way about cannabis (Tyler et al., 1988). Canada is first country in the world that has offers med-ical marijuana to its patients since 2003. Therefore, there is an increased necessity of research on the history of can-nabis for the sake of reinforcing the ability of pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges arising in the provision of professional services in order to facilitate hu-man life. Chronology from the past to the present History of cannabisCannabis is one of the oldest psychoactive plants known to humanity. It grows as weed and cultivated plant all over the world in a variety of climates and soils. Histor-ical records and archaeological materials date from 6000 BC pointing out the use of cannabis seeds for food in Chi-na. In 4000 BC textiles made of cannabis are used in Chi-na. Remains have been found of cannabis fibers from this period and a century later. First recorded use of cannabis as a medicine was in 2727 BC in Chinese pharmacopoeia. In 1500 BC cannabis is cultivated in China for food and fi-ber. Scythians cultivated cannabis and use it to weave fine hemp cloth. According to Herodotus they introduced can-nabis into Europe (Tucakov, 1948). Bhang, composed from dried cannabis leaves, seeds and stems is mentioned in the Hindu sacred text Atharva veda as \u201cSacred Grass\u201d, one of the five sacred plants of India. It is used medicinally and ritually as an offering to Shiva. Scythian tribes leave canna-bis seeds as offerings in royal tombs. This closely matches the Herodotus reports on both ritual and recreation use of cannabis by the Scythians. The psychotropic properties of cannabis are mentioned in the newly compiled herbal Pent Ts\u2019ao Ching which is attributed to an emperor Shen Nung. He recommended it against malaria, constipation, rheu-matic pains, and absence of the spirit, female problems and a mixture of cannabis, resin and wine as an analgesic dur-ing surgery (Booth, 2003). Cannabis as psychoactive plant is respected from Buddhists. In an old testament is men-tioned as a sacred plant in holy anointing oil prepared from myrrh, laurel, cinnamon and \u201ckaneh bosm\u201c- identified by linguists as cannabis (Teodorova et al., 2005). Dioscorides S5 PP 227478Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 477 - 478 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsin 70 AD mentions the use of cannabis as a Roman medi-cament while Galen in 170 AD alludes to the psycho activ-ity of cannabis seed confections. The Jewish Talmud men-tions the euphoria properties of cannabis. Ancient Greeks and Romans were also familiar with cannabis, while in the Middle East, use spread throughout the Islamic empire to North Africa. In the early 12th century hashish smoking is very popular throughout the Middle East. Cannabis is in-troduced in Egypt during the reign of the Ayyubid dynas-ty in 12th century. Arab traders bring cannabis to the Mo-zambique coast of Africa in 13th century. Marco Polo dur-ing his journeys from 1254-1324 gives reports that Assas-sins are using hashish (Mez-Mangold, 1971). In 1545 can-nabis spread to the western hemisphere where Spaniards imported it to Chile for its use as fiber. In North America cannabis, in the form of hemp, was grown on many plan-tations for use as rope, clothing and paper. In the late 17th century hashish becomes a major trade item between Cen-tral Asia and South Asia. Napoleon discovers that much of the Egyptians habitually used hashish. His soldiers in their returning to France bring the tradition with them in 1798 year (Tucakov, 1948).Medicinal properties of cannabisMedicinal use of marijuana arrived in Europe from the East during the 18th century. It was brought to Eu-rope much later, but it was not less popular. It reaches the high society very soon. In Paris, a club was open where many famous people, even Balzac, enjoyed marijuana. The first comprehensive description of the medical use of In-dian hemp in Europe was written in 1830 by the German pharmacist Friedrich Ludwig Nees von Esenbeck. Until that point in time, use of marijuana for medical purpos-es had remained at a low level. Thanks mainly to the work of W.B.O\u2019Shaugnessy in 1839 marijuana become recog-nized within European \u2013 school medicine. He used various hemp compounds in his investigations, partly with great success, against rheumatism, rabies, cholera, tetanus, con-vulsions and delirium tremens. In America in 1840 medici-nal preparations with cannabis base are available in Persian pharmacies. Hashish\u2019s eater\u2019s club is established in Paris in 1843 and after 1850 hashish appears in Greece (Booth, 2003). Cannabis begins to prohibit for nonmedical use in the US during 1915-1927. The prestigious US Institute of Medicine published its report Medical Use of Marijuana in 1999 (Weiner, 1990). Recent studies reviewed by Park et al. 2004 that marijuana, THC and other exogenous canna-binoids exert potent effects on the endocannabinoid sys-tem in both the gonads and during pregnancy (Frankhaus-er, 2008). ConclusionCannabis preparations have been used as remedies for thousands of years and the active ingredients of the plant can be put to use in a multitude of medical conditions. Can-nabis has been used throughout history in many different cultures to change mood, perception and consciousness. Its effects range from increasing creativity to provoking mys-tical experiences, to heightening the capacity to feel sense and share. The reports established the evidence base sup-port for the further examination of cannabis products for medical use. ReferencesBooth, M., 2003. Cannabis \u2013 a history.

Juniper cones have long been used in medicine, food and the cosmetic indus-try. In the traditional medicine, preparations of juniper cones are used as folk remedy mostly against rheumatic complaints (Mustafa et al., 2012). In addition to the man-ifold and diverse chemical composition of secondary me-tabolites found in Juniper cone oil, it also has different bi-ological activities, including hypoglycemic, carminative, antioxidant, antiseptic, and antibacterial activity (Hajdari et al., 2015). Chemical composition of essential oils of J. nana has been reported by several authors (Filipowicz et al., 2006; Proenca da-Cunhaa and Roquea, 1989). Previously we studied the composition of essential oils in two Juniperus species J. communis and J. oxycedrus re-spectively growing wild in Kosovo (Hajdari et al., 2015). On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies that address the composition of es-sential oils obtained from J. nana, therefore the principal aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composi-tion of the essential oils obtained from ripe cones, branch-es and leaves of this plant harvested from wild population in Kosovo. Materials and methodsPlant materials (ripe cones) of Juniperus nana were collected in wild populations in locality Hajle, Bjeshket e Nemuna, Kosovo (Latitude, 42\u00b0 45\u2019 12\u2019\u2019 N; Longitude, 20\u00b0 07\u2019 59\u2019\u2019 E; Altitude, 2029 m). Voucher specimens of each population were deposited with the Herbarium of the De-partment of Biology, University of Prishtina. For the es-sential oil extraction the plant material was air-dried in the shade at room temperature, prior to processing and chemi-cal analysis. The ripe cones were chopped up in small piec-es, and the essential oils were obtained by hydrodistilla-tion using a Clevenger apparatus for 3 hours. The sam-ples were stored in the dark at -18 \u00b0C in a freezer until further analysis. The yield of essential oil is expressed as the volume percentage of the dry mass of the air-dried plant material. GC/FID analyses were performed using an Agilent 7890A GC system equipped with an FID detector (Agilent Technologies). The separation was conducted on a HP-5MS column (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm with a 0.25 \u03bcm film thickness). Helium was used as the carrier gas with an ini-tial flow rate of 0.6 ml/min and then at a constant pressure of 50.0 psi. The front inlet was maintained at 250 \u00b0C in a split ratio of 50:1. The GC oven temperature was increased from 60 \u00b0C to 260 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min, and the FID was operated at 250 \u00b0C with an air flow of 350 mL/min and a hydrogen flow of 35 mL/min. The injection volume was 1.0 \u03bcL.GC/MS analyses were performed using an Agile-nt 7890A GC system coupled to a 5975C MSD (Agile-nt Technologies). The ionisation energy was 70 eV with a mass range of 40 - 400 m/z. The separation was conduct-S5 PP 228480Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 479 - 480 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsed using the same column and temperature program as for the analytical GC.The identification of each of the components of the es-sential oil was performed by comparing their Kovat\u2019s re-tention indices with those from the literature. The Kovat\u2019s index was calculated based on a linear interpolation of the retention times of a homologous series of n-alkanes (C9-C28) under the same operating conditions. The components were also identified by comparing the mass spectra of each constituent with those stored in the NIST 08.L and WI-LEY MS 9th databases and with mass spectra from the lit-erature. Furthermore, some of the main peaks were iden-tified by comparing the retention times and mass spectra with those of authentic constituents. The percentage com-position of the oils was computed using the normalization method from the GC peak areas, calculated as the mean of three samples, without correction factors. Results and discussionIn total 75 constituents were identifies in the essential oils obtained from the juniper cones, leaves and branch-es. Principal constituents were monoterpenes: \u03b1-pinene (24.7-36.7%); sabinene (8.2-22.9%); myrcene (4.3-1.6%); D-limonene (2.4-4.4%); \u03b2-pinene (1.6-2.4%); ter-pinolene (1.0-1.9%). Concentration of oxygenated mono-terpene, terpinene-4-ol was 1.4-7.5%. Monoterpenes were followed by sesquiterpenes: germacrene D (2.0-7.9%); \u03b1-caryophyllene (0.4-2.1%); bicyclogermacrene (0.3-2.2%); \u03b2-caryophyllene (0.1-1.9%); zonarene (0.5-3.1%); \u03b4-cadinene (0.7-3.9%); germacrene B (0.2-1.1%); \u03b2-elemene (0.3-1.9%), whereas concentration of the oxy-genated sesquiterpene, 1-epi-\u03b1-cadinol, ranged from 0.7-4.1%. In regard to the percentages of essential oil constit-uents in different drug organs, experimental data revealed that monoterpenes were the most abundant constituents in berries, whereas the highest concentration of sesquiter-penes and oxygenated sesquiterpenes was in branches. Re-sults are in the accordance with previously published data where \u03b1-pinene and sabinene were principal components of J. nana (Filipowicz et al., 2006). In Portugese sample, the major hydrocarbon components of the oil were \u03b1-pinene (20.0%), \u03b4-cadinene (10.4%), limonene (8.7%), and myr-cene (8.5%) (Proenca da-Cunhaa and Roquea, 1989). ConclusionThe study of chemical composition essential oils ob-tained from berries, branches and leaves of J. nana grow-ing wild in the Bjeshket e Nemuna region in Kosovo repre-sents a contribution in the field of the essential oil constit-uents of the genus Juniperus. The main essential oil com-ponents were a-pinene, followed by sabinene, myrcene and germacrene D. ReferencesFilipowicz, N., Piotrowski, A., Ochocka, J.R., Asztemborska, M., 2006.

Functional food pro-vides the health advantages because of their physiologically active substances (Maskovicet al., 2015). Phenolics and fla-vonoids isolated from plants are one of the groups of func-tional ingredient which can enhance health, increase psychi-cal and mental well-being and scavenge free radicals (Men-rad, 2003). It is known that family Lamiaceae, where sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum, L.) belongs to, has a strong anti-oxidant activity because of great amount of phenolic and fla-vonoid components. Phenolic antioxidants prevent free rad-icals from the substrate by donating hydrogen atoms or elec-trons (Kaurinovic et al., 2011). Sweet basil is widely used plant which could be used in the form of teas, essential oils, liquid extracts, and as a spice and has an important appli-cation in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. It is mostly used in a treatment of inflammatory diseases, headaches, constipation, respiratory infections, flu, cough, insomnia and also as sedative and anticonvulsant. It is es-timated that about 60% of the total population of the world uses herbs and natural products and basil is recognized as important drug in their nutrition (Harvey, 2000). Materials and methodsDifferent extracts were obtained by various types of extraction: maceration with ethanol (30%, v/v) and dis-tilled water (30 minutes and 24 hours), infusion (10 min-utes), microwave (4 minutes) and ultrasound extraction (10 minutes). The amount of total phenolic compounds in the extracts was determined colorimetrically with the Fo-lin\u2013Ciocalteu (FC) reagent (Bo\u017ein et al., 2008). The absor-bance of the resulting solution was measured at 760 nm on a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The concentration of to-tal phenolic compounds was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per g of dried extract (DE), using a stan-dard curve of gallic acid. Measurement of total flavonoid content in the investigated extracts was determined spec-trophotometrically, using a method based on the formation of Al-flavonoid complex with the absorbance maximum at 430 nm. The flavonoids content was expressed as l g of quercetin equivalents (QE) per g of dried extract (DE), by using a standard line. Antioxidant activity of extracts was determined using the DPPH method (Gruji\u0107 et al., 2012). Absorbance was measured at 515 nm. The IC50 value, de-fined as the concentration of the test sample leading to 50% reduction of the free radical concentration, was calculated graphically and expressed as \u03bcg of the extract/mL of the fi-nal solution in measuring cell. Testing of the neutralization of peroxide and hydroxide radical were carried out. RSC value represents the percentage of neutralization of perox-ide or hydroxide radical. The IC50 value which defined as the concentration of the test sample leading to 50% reduc-tion of the radical was tested. Absorbance was measured at 515 and 562 nm. Lipid peroxidation intensity was also tested and absorbance was measured at 532 nm. The IC50 values represented the concentration of the tested extract are responsible for 50% inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Chemical characterization of basil extracts was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using UV/Vis and fluorescence detectors. S5 PP 229482Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 481 - 482 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsResults and discussionBasil extracts contained chlorogenic, p-hydroxyben-zoic, caffeic, ferulic, vanillic, rosmarinic and cinnamic acid, rutin, quercetin, naringenin i epicatechin. From phe-nolic acids, the most common in the extracts are rosmarin-ic and ferulic acid which is in agreement with similar re-search (Lee and Scael, 2009). Using a fluorescent (FAD) detector, epicatechin was identified. Based on these re-sults, it can be concluded that the FAD is sensitive for the determination of certain flavonoids (epicatechin) com-pared to UV/Vis detector which is in accordance with the literature (Donovan et al., 1999). Total phenolic content ranged from 0.53-118.19 mg GAE/g DE, and the highest yield was determined in extract obtained as infusion af-ter 10 minutes. Flavonoid content ranged from 0.42-2.84 mg KE/g, with peak in microwave extract after 4 minutes. IC50 values (concentration of analyzed sample that is re-quired for 50% inhibition) varied from 11.72-210.39 \u03bcg/mL for DPPH radical. The highest antioxidant capacity showed a sample obtained with 30% ethanol after 30 min-utes. Testing the neutralization of the hydroxyl radicals, re-sults showed that the IC50 values ranged from 11.44-57.86 \u03bcg/mL. The highest scavenging activity showed a sample obtained by ultrasound by extraction after 10 minutes. Ex-amination of antioxidant activity by neutralization hydro-gen peroxide indicates that the samples obtained by dif-ferent extraction methods have shown IC50 values ranging from 0.41-52.45 \u03bcg/mL. The highest antioxidant activity, showed sample obtained by extraction with 30% ethanol for 30 minutes. Results of examination of antioxidant ac-tivity by the ability of inhibition of lipid peroxidase are summarized and IC50 values ranged from 1.41-46.99 \u03bcg/mL. Lowest IC50 (the highest antioxidant potential) corre-sponded to the sample obtained by the extraction with wa-ter for 30 minutes. ConclusionBasil extracts showed significant antioxidant activity. Sweet basil is a rich source of antioxidants that could con-tribute to its disease-fighting potential. Extracts with the strongest antioxidant capacity were obtained by ethanol (30%, v/v) maceration during 30 minutes and infusion dur-ing 10 minutes. Fluorescence detector of HPLC showed higher sensitivity for epicatechin determination than UV/Vis detector.ReferencesBozin, B., Mimica-Dukic, N., Bogavac, M., Suvajdzic, Lj., Simin, N., Samojlik, I., Couladis, M., 2008.

They may be-long to food or medicinal plants. The research in last 10 years has concentrated efforts to identify molecular targets for these natural components. Several major cell-signal-ing pathways have been identified by which plant derived components influence carcinogenesis. Carcinogenesis may affect: transcription factors (nu-clear factor-kapa B (NF-kB), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3), anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X1), pro-apoptotic proteins (caspases), protein kinases (mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP)), cell cycle proteins (cy-clins), cell adhesion molecules, cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2), lipoxygenase (LOX) and growth factor pathway. A big variety of plants employs modulation of NF-kB activity as the main pathway for anticancer effect. NF-kB can be acti-vated by free radicals, inflammatory stimuli, cytokines, en-dotoxins, radiation etc. This paper presents natural occur-ring components for which evidence-based research identi-fied some molecular targets in cancer prevention and ther-apy (anethole capsaicin, curcumin, diosgenin, gambog-ic acid, gingerol, resveratrol, thymoquinone, ursolic acid, zerumbone) (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006; Aggarwal et al., 2008; Nobili, 2009; Rajput and Mandal, 2012).Selected plantsAnethole and derivatives (dithiolethione, eugenol, isoeugenol) present in fennel, anise, and camphor increase intracellular level of glutathione and glutathione S-trans-ferase. Eugenol and isoeugenol are antioxidants, affect lipid peroxidation and inhibit arachidonic acid - induced tromboxane B2, due to which these components are used in adenocarcinomas (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006). Ane-thole blocks NF-kB activation and affects inhibitory kappa B alpha kinase (IkB\u03b1). The suppression of carcinogenesis by anethole and derivatives is proposed to be by mediation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced cellular respons-es (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006; Aggarwal et al., 2008).Capsaicin presents anticancer effects in culture cells (human tumor cells) and in animal models (skin, colon, lung, tongue and prostate cancer). Capsaicin lead to accu-mulation of cells in G1 phase induced apoptosis and in-hibited proliferation. The molecular mechanism included blocking TNF-mediated activation of NF-kB. In human multiple myeloma cells it also blocked the STAT3 activa-tion pathway (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006; Aggarwal et al., 2008). Active compound of curcumin is polyphenol diferu-loylmethane. It down regulates COX-2 and LOX expres-sion, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necro-sis factor (TNF), chemokines, cell surface adhesion mole-cules, growth factor receptors (epidermal growth factor re-ceptor - EGFR and human epidermal growth factor recep-tor \u2013 HER2) and inhibits protein kinases (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006; Aggarwal et al., 2008).Diosgenin, as a steroid saponin, is common for many different plants. It inhibits proliferation and straightens apoptosis in cell cultures (human colon cancer, osteosar-coma, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis). The proposed mo-lecular mechanisms are disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, release of apoptosis-inducing factors, modulation of cas-pase-3, COX-2 and LOX activity, binding to chemokine receptor. It can suppress osteoclastogenesis through inhi-bition of TNF-mediated activation of NF-kB (Aggarwal et al., 2008).S5 PP 230484Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 483 - 484 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsGambogic acid derived from resin of Garcinia indi-ca inhibited gastric, hepatic breast and lung cancer. Some of the specific molecular mechanisms include inhibition of telomerase and telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA ex-pression and interaction with transferrin receptor. Since it inhibited the expression of gene products in apoptosis, pro-liferation and angiogenesis, which are all regulated by NF-kB it modulates on general level NF-kB pathway (Aggar-wal et al., 2008). Gingerol has been tested mostly in prostate, gastric and breast cancer. Topically applied it inhibited COX-2 ex-pression by suppression of NF-kB (Aggarwal and Shisho-dia, 2006).Resveratrol from grapes uses many different general molecular targets in apoptosis among which modulates ac-tivity of NF-kB and MAP kinases (Aggarwal and Shisho-dia, 2006).Thymoquinone, a quinone from black cumin, sup-presses proliferation of colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic and breast cancer, osteosarcoma, myeloblastic leukemia. It down regulates COX-2 and 5-LOX activity, iNOS, TNF and cyclin D1 which are all known to be regulated by NF-kB. Thymoquinone prevented tumor angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (Aggarwal et al., 2008).Ursolic acid is a triterpenoid present in many plants in different amounts, but considerably in rosemary. It sup-presses expression of genes regulated by NF-kB, COX-2, LOX, iNOS, matrix metaloproteinase. It induces apoptosis by inhibition of DNA replication, inhibition of protein ty-rosine kinases, activation of caspases and induction of Ca2+ release (Aggarwal et al., 2008).Zerumbone, isolated from essential oil of wild ginger, has been effective in colon, breast and skin cancer. It inhib-its activation of NF-kB and NF-kB-regulated gene expres-sion. It also suppresses superoxide and nitric oxide gener-ation and down-regulates COX-2, interleukin (IL-1) and TNF (Aggarwal et al., 2008).Conclusion Plants known as spices, general food or medicinal plants have been investigated for anticancer activity. It was found that they target different molecules in carcinogene-sis. Therefore, the contribution to antitumor effect of a sin-gle plant may be due to synergic action of all active signal-ing pathways that the plant exert.

In the lights of that, biological active compounds deriving from plants are attracting more and more attention. Fruits from Sorbus genus are commonly consumed fresh or as tradi-tionally prepared preservatives, such as jam, juice, jelly or wine. The same are also widely used as remedy in a treat-ment of anemia, dyspepsia rheumatism and many digestive disorders. In spite of the widespread use in diet, preserva-tives preparation, beverage manufacture and the traditional medicine, there are still very few reports concerning their detailed phenolic profile and biological activities. Name-ly, within Sorbus genus, the most renowned species are S. aucuparia and S. domestica which are the most utilized as food. On the other hand, other species from Sorbus genus, such as S. intermedia (Swedish Whitebeam) are quite un-explored and the literature data are also very limited. Over-all, plant phenolics are recognized as phytonutrients with significant biological activities which are generally based on their ability to prevent oxidative stress and minimize oxidative cell injury. Thus, the aim of this study was a de-tailed examination of 44 plant phenolics using LC-MS/MS technique and antioxidant potential of S. intermedia.Materials and methodsPlant material was collected in November 2013, in Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia. Five extracts of fruits were prepared: water extract of fresh (WF) and air-dried sample (WD), methanol extract of fresh (MF) and air-dried sample (MD) as well as extract of traditionally prepared jam (J). For preparation of methanol extracts, 30 g fresh or air-dried fruits were grinded and extracted by maceration with 80% aqueous methanol (1 mL of solvent/ 0.1 g of plant materi-al), constantly shaken at 120 rpm/min during 72 h at room temperature. For preparation of water extracts, 30 g fresh or air-dried fruits were grinded and extracted by maceration with boiling, distilled water (1 mL of solvent/ 0.1 g of plant material), constantly shaken at 120 rpm/min during 1 h at room temperature. After filtration, the solvents were evapo-rated in vacuum at 40 \u00b0C. Crude residues were dissolved in hot, distilled water (10 mL/g). In order to remove the non-polar compounds, the extracts were washed exhaustively with petroleum ether (fraction 40\u221260 \u00b0C) and concentrated to dryness under vacuum, yielding 9.84%, 26.87%, 6.84% and 31.59% for MF, MD, WF and WD extracts of S. inter-media fruits, respectively. Jam was prepared according to Serbian traditional recipe by cooking fruits in boiled wa-ter and crushing them during stirring. Afterwards, cooked fruits were sieved in order to remove seeds. The obtained product corresponds to definition of fruit pur\u00e9e. Further, in order to prepare jam the pur\u00e9e was boiled and 350 g of sug-ar per 1 L of pur\u00e9e was added. The mixture was stirred un-til appropriate consistency of jam. In order to prepare jam extracts, jam of S. intermedia, was weighed out (10 g) and evaporated in vacuum at 40 \u00b0C. Crude residues of jam ex-tract were dissolved in hot, distilled water (10 mL of water/ 1g of crude residue). Extract was then filtered and evapo-rated in vacuum at 40 \u00b0C yielding 33.08%. Dried extracts of methanol, water and jam were dissolved in distilled wa-ter to obtain 300 mg/mL stock solutions for evaluation of the total phenolic and flavonoid content, as well as antioxi-dant activity. Additionally, dried extracts were dissolved in distilled water for LC-MS/MS analysis to obtain 20 mg/mL stock solutions. Determination of selected phenolics in ex-S5 PP 231486Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 485 - 486 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationstracts of S. intermedia, was performed according to previ-ously reported procedure (Or\u010di\u0107 et al., 2014). For estima-tion of total phenolic and total flavonoid content method reported by Beara et al., (2014) was conducted. In order to examine antioxidant activity of S. intermedia several dif-ferent in vitro assays were performed. The scavenging ef-fect on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), super oxide anion (O2\u2022-), nitric oxide (NO) and hydroxyl (HO\u2022) radical, reducing power (FRAP assay) were tested according Beara et al. (2014).Results and discussionPresence of seven phenolics was confirmed using LC-MS/MS analysis, with chlorogenic acid being the most abundant compound particularly in MF extracts. Further-more, we detected presence of selected flavonols such as, amentoflavone, epicatechin and quercetin-3-O-glucoside in S. intermedia fruit extracts, while there was no prior study which specifically identified mentioned compounds. The total phenolic content in extracts of S. intermedia fruits ranged from 0.10-5.28 mg GAE/g of dw. It could be generally concluded that the highest content of total phe-nolics were detected in air-dried extracts. Concerning the overall flavonoid content, similar amounts were found in all extracts. Having in mind that this is the first comprehen-sive study of phenolic compounds in S. intermedia fruits, the obtained results are significant for further research and could support their usage as food supplement with heath benefits. Generally, the methanol extracts, especially fresh fruits showed the highest antiradical activity in all tests performed. Testing the neutralization of the hydroxyl radi-cals, results showed that the IC50 values ranged from 0.18-0.88 mg/mL. Methanol extract of fresh and air-dried fruits demonstrated a significant, same as standard antioxidant BHT, HO\u2022 scavenger activity. These facts are particular-ly important because O2\u2022- react fast with other free radicals, such as NO\u2022, and can cause biological damage occurring in many human diseases. Interestingly, jam extract was good as methanol extract of fresh fruit in neutralisation of DPPH radical, had a higher reducing power of extracts and was more active in neutralisation of NO\u2022 radical than water ex-tracts.ConclusionOverall, according to the results presented it could be noted that extracts exhibited some antioxidant activity and jam showed to be rich source of antioxidants in everyday diet. Also, presented results firmly support everyday con-sumption of Sorbus intermedia fruits as food with valuable health benefits.ReferencesBeara, I.N., Lesjak, M.M., Cetojevi\u0107-Simin, D.D., Marjanovi\u0107, Z.S., Risti\u0107, J.D., Mrkonji\u0107, Z.O., Mimica-Duki\u0107, N.M., 2014.

MacedoniaBujar Qazimi*, Gjoshe Stefkov, Marija Karapandzova, Ivana \u0421vetkovikj,  Svetlana KulevanovaInstitute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University Ss. \u0421yril and Methodius,  Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* bqazimi2003@yahoo.comIntroductionMountain tea (Sideritis scardica) is endemic to the Balkan Peninsula and is distributed in R. Macedonia, Bul-garia, Turkey, Albania and Greece (Obon de \u0421astro, 1994). Flowering parts of S. scardica are widely utilized in Med-iterranean folk medicine in the form of a decoction or in-fusion. Various extracts of S. scardica are rich with flavo-noids, phenolic acids, terpenes, phenylpropanoids (Kara-pandzova et al., 2013; Petreska et al., 2011) and show com-plex mineral composition (Karapandzova et al., 2013). However, the specific and particular aroma is maybe the most important reason for the wide use of the plant (Qa-zimi et al., 2014a). Rosette leaves of mountain tea tradi-tionally are not used (Qazimi et al., 2014b), although char-acterized by specific aroma. There are no data about the volatile aroma compounds in the rosette leaves. To ana-lyze these compounds a refined method of headspace sam-pling hyphenated with G\u0421/FID/MS analysis can be uti-lized (Watson, 2005).Therefore, the aim of this work was the determina-tion of the volatile aroma compounds in the fresh and dried spontaneous and cultivated rosette leaves of S. scardica us-ing a headspace (HS) method with G\u0421/FID/MS.Materials and methodsPlant material: The rosette leaves of S. scardica were collected in three different localities in R. Macedonia dur-ing the summer of 2012. The spontaneous samples were collected from Ljuboten (Shara Mountain) and Gurgur-nica (Suva Gora). One cultivated sample was collected from Dren (near Prilep). The plant material was air dried, packed in paper bags and kept in a dark and cold place un-til analysis. Analyses of aroma compoundsGC and GC-MS analyses: 0.3 g of fresh or dried ro-sette leaves was put in sealed vials, warmed for 5 min. and the gas phase (highly volatile compounds) was inves-tigated on Agilent 7890\u0410 Gas Chromatography system equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and Agile-nt 5975C Mass Quadrupole detector as well as capillary flow technology which enable simultaneous analysis of the sample on both detectors. HP-5ms (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 \u03bcm) capillary column was used. Oper-ating conditions were as follows: oven temperature 60 \u00b0C, 20 \u00b0C/min to 280 \u00b0C; helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injector temperature 260 \u00b0C and FID temperature 270 \u00b0C. 1000 \u03bcL of gas phase was injected at split ratio 1:1. The mass spectrometry conditions were: ionization volt-age 70 eV, ion source temperature 230 \u00b0C, transfer line temperature 280 \u00b0C and mass range from 50-500 Da. The MS was operated in scan mode. Headspace method: Incubation temperature 80 \u00b0C; in-cubation time 5 min; syringe temperature 85 \u00b0C; agitator speed 500 rpm.Identification of components: Identification of the components was made by comparing the mass spectra of components with those from NIST, Wiley and Adams mass libraries, by AMDIS (Automated Mass Spectral Deconvo-S5 PP 232488Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 487 - 488 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationslution and Identification System) and by comparing litera-ture and estimated Kovat\u2019s (retention) indices that were de-termined using a mixture of a homologous series of normal alkanes from \u04219 to \u042125 in n-hexane, under the same condi-tions. The percentage ratio of the components was comput-ed by the normalization method of the G\u0421/FID peak areas and average values were taken.Results and discussionTotal of 21 and 24 individual components were iden-tified in the fresh spontaneous (f-Ss) and in the fresh cul-tivated (f-Sc) rosette leaves of S. scardica, representing 96.62-100% and 98.05% of the total content, respective-ly. Data analysis of the chemical composition revealed five different classes of components: monoterpene hydrocar-bons (MH) 40.51-41.97% and 48.49%, oxygen contain-ing monoterpenes (OM) 3.65-4.17% and 4.46%, sesqui-terpene hydrocarbons (SH) 42.07-47.66% and 30.31%, oxygen containing sesquiterpenes (OS) 0.57-3.12% and 0.18%, alcohols (AL) 4.54-8.36% and 14.21%, respec-tively. The prevailing components in f-Ss and f-Sc sam-ples were: \u03b2-pinene (21.15-24.79% and 27.63%), \u03b1-pinene (11.42-12.69% and 14.09%) and limonene (3.40-7.49% and 6.53%) from the MH fraction; followed by the SH: germacrene D (21.05-21.82% and 14.53%) and trans- caryophyllene (10.86-13.00% and 9.76%), and the alco-hol, 1-octen-3-ol (4.54-8.36% and 14.21%). The represen-tatives from the OM and OS fractions were considered as minor constituents (< 2%). Total of 14 and 16 individual components were iden-tified in the dried spontaneous (d-Ss) and in the dried cul-tivated (d-Sc) rosette leaves of S. scardica, representing 89.36-96.81% and 98.37% of the total content, respec-tively. MH formed 40.32-55.43% and 92.43%, OM 2.99-26.16% and 1.72%, SH 17.6-23.59% and 4.22%, respec-tively. The OS fraction was found only in the d-Ss sam-ples, 10.35-12.73%. The most abundant components in d-Ss and d-Sc samples were monoterpene hydrocarbons: \u03b2-pinene (21.25-23.12% and 38.89%), \u03b1-pinene (19.07-19.81% and 33.05%) and limonene (up to 6.68% and 13.01%). The higher abundance of OM: trans-pinocarveol (2.99-10.03%), myrtenal (up to 6.37%), pinocarvone (up to 5.09%), SH: germacrene D (4.91-9.29%), trans-caryoph-yllene (4.34-5.90%), \u03b4-cadinene (3.03-5.93%), \u03b1-copaene (2.47-5.32%) and OS: caryophyllene oxide (6.76-9.35%) was specific only for the dried spontaneous samples of ro-sette leaves. The number of components found in d-Sc was larger than in d-Ss. Also, the share of the classes of compo-nents in d-Sc (MH > SH > OM) differed from d-Ss (MH > OM > SH > OS). ConclusionGenerally, f-Sc and d-Sc contain larger amount of monoterpenes, but smaller amount of sesquiterpenes than f-Ss and d-Ss. Only minor differences were revealed in the qualitative composition of the aroma volatiles between spontaneous and cultivated rosette leaves of S. scardica. Furthermore, there was almost no difference in the chem-ical profiles of the aroma components between fresh and dried rosette leaves, except 1-octen-3-ol, that was present only in fresh rosette leaves of S. scardica.

Macedonia* bqazimi2003@yahoo.comIntroductionSideritis scardica Griseb. is wild, hardy flowering pe-rennials, known as mountain tea and is often used for pre-paring teas to cure common cold, to alleviate sinus con-gestion, aches, pains and viruses, including flu (Karapan-dzova et al., 2013). The important role of S. scardica as traditional remedies tea and its conservation status has re-quired its cultivation as market production (Kostadinova et al., 2008). Methanol and boiling water extracts (by do-mestic infusion procedure) of S. scardica showed that ex-tracts were rich in bound forms of phenolics such as hy-droxycinnamic acids, phenylethanoid glycosides and fla-vonoid glycosides, and showed very high antioxidant ca-pacity (Petreska et al., 2011a). Phenolic compounds have several roles in the plants physiological processes and have demonstrated significant health beneficial effects (Petres-ka et al., 2011b).Therefore, the aim of this work was the determination of the phenolic compounds in the methanolic extracts of spontaneous and cultivated flowering stems of S. scardica using LC/DAD/ESI-MSn.Materials and methodsPlant material: The flowering stems of S. scardica were collected in four different localities in R. Macedonia during the summer of 2013. The spontaneous samples (Ss) were collected from Ljuboten (Shara Mountain), Gurgur-nica (Suva Gora) and Lazaropole (Bistra Mountain). One cultivated sample (Sc) was collected from Dren (near to Prilep). The plant material was air dried, packed in paper bags and kept in a dark and cold place until analysis. Extraction of phenolic compounds: 0.2 g of powder plant material (homogenized samples from flower, leaf and stem) was extracted with 25 mL of 70% methanol, 30 min using US bath. The supernatant was filtered through 0.45 \u03bcm pore-size polyethersulfone filter before analysis.LC/DAD/ESI-MSn analysis: Chromatographic separa-tions were carried out on 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m C18 Luna column (Phenomenix). The mobile phase consist-ed of two solvents: water - formic acid (1% v/v) (A) and methanol (B). A linear gradient starting with 25% B was installed to reach 30% B at 7 min, 45% B at 30 min, 50% B at 50 min and 100% B at from 55 to 60 min. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min to 50 min and 0.8 mL/min from 50 min to 65 min, the injection volume 10 \u00b5L. The HPLC sys-tem was equipped with an Agilent 1100 series diode array and mass detector in series (Agilent Technologies, Wald-bronn, Germany). Spectral data from all peaks were accumulated in range 190-600 nm and chromatograms were recorded at 290 and 300 nm from glycosides and acylated derivatives and at 330 nm for phenylethanoid glycosides and hydroxy-cinnamic acid. The mass detector was a G2449A Ion-Trap Mass Spectrometar equipped with an electrospray ionisa-tion (ESI) system and controlled by LCMSD software (Ag-S5 PP 233490Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 489 - 490 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsilent, v.6.1.). Nitrogen was used as nebulising gas at pres-sure of 65 psi and the flow was adjusted to 12 L/min. The heated capillary and the voltage were maintained at 325 \u00baC and 4 kV, respectively. MS data were acquired in the nega-tive ionization mode. The full scan covered the mass range at m/z 100-1200. Collision\u2013induced fragmentation experi-ments were performed in the ion trap using helium as col-lision gas, with voltage ramping cycle from 0.3 up to 2 V. Maximum accumulation time of ion trap and the number of MS repetitions to obtain the MS average spectra were set at 300 ms and 5, respectively.The identification and peak assigmentation of all phe-nolic compounds was based on comparison of their reten-tion times and mass spectral data with those of standards and published dates. Hydroxycinnamic acids were quanti-fied using 5-caffeoylquinic acid external standard at 330 nm, phenylethanoid glycosides were quantified and ex-pressed as verbascoside equivalent at 330 nm, hypolae-tin glucosides were quantified with 4\u2019-O-methylhypolae-tin 7-O-[6\u2032\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1\u21922)glucoside at 290 nm, whereas isoscutellarein glucosides were quantified and ex-pressed as isoscutellarein 7-O-[6\u2032\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1\u21922)glucoside equivalent at 300 nm. The stock solutions of phe-nolic standards were made up in 70% methanol to a con-centration of 1000 \u00b5g/mL. The corresponding calibration curves were constructed with five dilutions of the stock so-lutions.Results and discussionPhenolic compounds in the Sideritis extracts were identified by their UV spectra, their deprotonated molec-ular ions and their corresponding ion fragments, by using LC/DAD/ESI-MSn. Total of 30 and 19 individual compo-nents were identified in the methanolic extracts of sponta-neous (Ss) and in the cultivated (Sc) flowering stems of S. scardica, representing 45.71-100.97 mg/g DW and 49.46 mg/g DW of the total content, respectively. Phenolic com-pounds in Ss and Sc were classified into four groups: hy-droxycinnamic acids derivatives (4 and 3), phenylethanoid glycosides (8 and 5), flavonoid 7-O-diglucosides (5 and 4) and flavonoid acetylglucosides aglycones (13 and 7).The total amount of hydroxycinnamic acid deriva-tives in Ss and Sc extracts ranged from 2.80-5.31 mg/g and 2.28 mg/g, respectively. 5-Caffeoylquinic acid was found in all samples and it was dominant hydroxycinnamic acid. Phenylethanoid glycosides (PHEG) were the abundant group of polyphenols in the studied samples with the con-tent ranging from 17.92-59.39 mg/g in Ss and 11.68 mg/g in Sc. Verbascoside (7.07-24.00 mg/g), lavandulfolioside (4.77-14.92 mg/g), jonaside A (0.75-6.54 mg/g), allysono-side (1.23-6.40 mg/g), forsythoside A (1.03-4.01 mg/g) and leucoseptoside A (1.32-3.00 mg/g) were the most abundant compounds in Ss samples and represent around 90% of to-tal PHEG content. Verbascoside (6.77 mg/g) and lavan-dulfolioside (2.47 mg/g) were the major compounds in Sc sample. Total content of flavonoid glycosides (non acet-ylated and acetylated) in Ss and Sc ranged from 24.75- 42.00 mg/g and 35.49 mg/g, respectively. The prevail-ing components in Ss and Sc samples were  isoscutella-rein 7-O-[6\u2032\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1\u21922)glucoside (2.00-5.47 mg/g and 12.89 mg/g), 3\u2019-O-methylhypolaetin 7-O-[6\u2032\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1\u21922)glucoside (2.89-10.76 mg/g and 10.34 mg/g), hypolaetin 7-O-[6\u2032\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1\u21922)glucoside (2.44-3.79 mg/g and 1.13 mg/g) and apigen-in 7-(6\u201d-p-coumaroylglucoside) (1.72-2.52 mg/g and 2.61 mg/g), respectively. 4\u2019-O-Methylhypolaetin 7-O-[6\u2032\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl]-allosyl-(1\u21922)-[6\u2032\u2032-O-acetyl]-glucoside (3.34-8.78 mg/g) was the major component only in Ss samples.ConclusionGenerally, the number of phenolic components found in Ss was larger than in Sc. The differences in total phe-nolic content between spontaneous and cultivated samples are directly correlated with differences in phenylethanoid content.

The importance of the red hot pepper varieties and their oleoresin extracts in the food and pharmaceutical industry is caused by the characteristic compounds, capsa-icinoids and carotenoids (Guzman et al., 2011). Mainly, for determination of the compounds in the sweet or hot pepper varieties, the chromatographic methods (TLC, HPLC and GC) and UV-VIS spectrometric method were used (Davis et al., 2008; Othman et al., 2011). On the other hand, 1H NMR spectroscopy has been extensively used to provide information about the composition and relative content of fatty acid units in triglycerides (Barison et al., 2010). For analysis of the capsaicinoids and carotenoids, NMR spec-troscopy is one of the most informative methods applied (G\u00f3mez-Calvario et al., 2015). The degree of unsaturation of vegetable oils can be effectively studied by IR spectros-copy based on the changes observed in the frequency data of some bands and in the ratios of absorbances of the IR spectra (Vlachos et al., 2006). Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the possibility of applying spectroscop-ic techniques (NMR and IR) in the characterization of ex-tracts obtained from red hot pepper.Materials and methodsExtracts from the pericarp, placenta, seeds, and stalk of red hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L., ssp. microcarpum longum conoides, convar. Horgoshka) obtained by extrac-tion with n-hexane using Soxhlet method and supercriti-cal carbon dioxide were analyzed using NMR and ATR-IR spectroscopy. The NMR spectra were run on a Bruk-er AVANCE II+ 600 spectrometer at ambient temperature. About 15 mg of each sample were dissolved in CDCl3. TMS was used as an internal standard. The ATR-IR spec-tra were measured in the middle IR region 600-4000 cm\u20131 on a Brucker Tensor 27 FT spectrometer. The samples were directly deposed on diamond crystal ATR accessory and spectra were recorded by accumulating 64 scans at resolu-tion of 2 cm\u20131.Results and discussionNMR Spectra. It was shown that the samples of ex-tracts from the seeds contain exclusively triglycerides (TG). The calculated percent of unsaturated fatty acids was estimated about 80%. The estimated linoleic:oleic acid ra-S5 PP 234492Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 491 - 492 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationstio was 2:1. N-polyunsaturated fatty acids (linolenic acid) were not observed. In this way the composition of TG in the seeds was shown to be similar to the corn and soybean oil. Traces of capsaicinoids were detected, while quantita-tive determination was not possible. Carotenoids were not detected. The spectra of the samples from pericarp showed similar composition as these from the seeds. Additionally, the presence of about 25% of n-polyunsaturated fatty acids was detected. In the samples from the placenta a substan-tial amount of capsaicinoids was presented. The proportion of TG:capsaicinoids was 1:2. In the region delta about 1.2-1.4 ppm intense signals appear for long CH2 chains, prob-ably waxes. In the stalk samples intensive signals were obtained due to presence of waxes. The proportion of the TG:capsaicinoids was approximately 1:0.15. ATR-IR Spectra. The oil composition affects the ex-act position of the band for the C-H stretching of the cis-double bond, and yields higher-frequency shift when the oil has higher content of polyunsaturated acyl groups (Vla-chos et al., 2006). Furthermore, the ratio of the absorbance of the bands responsible for the C-H stretching of the cis-double bonds and the asymmetric C-H stretching the meth-ylene bonds could be used for quantitative estimation of the degree of unsaturation (Vlachos et al., 2006). In the ATR-IR spectra of the extracts of Capsicum annuum the band for the C-H stretching of the cis-double bond typical for vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid, such as soybean and corn oil, was found at 3009 cm\u20131. According to the ratio of the absorbance at 3009 and 2923 cm\u20131, the highest degree of unsaturation was found for the seed extracts. Also, the ATR-IR technique provides a fast and reliable identifica-tion of capsaicinoids in Capsicum annuum extracts. The typical frequencies of the amide C=O stretching and am-ide N-H bending vibration of capsaicin do not overlap with the IR bands of triglycerides, and therefore allow identifi-cation of capsaicinoids even at low concentrations. Among the studied extracts, those obtained from placenta had the highest content of capsaicinoids. However, for exact deter-mination of the capsaicinoids content a calibration curve based on a series of standard mixtures with known amount of triglycerides and capsaicin is required.ConclusionExtracts from the pericarp, placenta, seeds, and stalk of red hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L., ssp. microcar-pum longum conoides, convar. Horgoshka) were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy. It was shown that both spec-tral techniques provide useful information on the triglycer-ide content and degree of unsaturation of the red hot pep-per extracts. The IR spectroscopy could serve as a fast tool for identification of capsaicinoids in the extracts, while the NMR analysis could be successfully applied for determi-nation of the proportion tryglycerides:capsaicinoids.ReferencesBarison, A., Pereira da Silva, C.W., Campos, F.R., Simonelli, F., Lenz, C.A.,  Ferreira, A.G., 2010.

Macedonia* viktorija.maksimova@ugd.edu.mkIntroductionIn the last few decades, capsaicin has exerted potent anti-cancer properties by enouncing anti-proliferative, apoptotic and anti-metastatic activity. To the best of our knowledge, the specific cell targets and successive mech-anism of cytotoxic activity of capsaicin in different type of malignant cells, still remains unclear and contradictory. Therefore, this mini review, explains some of the most sig-nificant chemopreventive mechanisms of the action of cap-saicin at a cellular level, reported in the recent literature.    The specific cytotoxic activity of capsaicin is usually a result of targeting of capsaicin toward two aims: TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1) and tumor associated NADPH-oxidase. Some researchers reported that capsaicin provokes its anticancer activity through the interaction with TRPV1 receptor (Kim et al., 2006). Amantini et al., (2007) reported that capsaicin elicits apoptosis in U373 glioma cells, because the TRPV1 receptor was highly expressed and oppositely the cytotox-ic effect in U87 cell line in which the TRPV1 receptor was very low expressed, capsaicin did not show cytotoxic ef-fects (Amantini et al., 2007). Hu et al., (2008) have shown that TRPV1 receptor is included in capsaicin induced Ca2+ influx, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), depo-larization of the mitochondrial membrane, and ultimately cell death on the synovial fibroblasts in rats. On the other side, capsaicin is one of the molecules which could inhib-it the activity of tumor associated NADPH-oxidase, which is related to the inhibition of proliferation of cancer cells (Hedges et al., 2003).  The ability of capsaicin to inhibit the growth of differ-ent cancer cells is primary mediated by its ability to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis represents a type of programmed cell death, which is one of the physiological mechanisms for maintaining the homeostasis in the organism. It has been reported that two different pathways are mainly mediating the process of activation of apoptosis. First one is extrinsic pathway which is accomplished by activating of the \u201cdeath receptor\u201d, and the other is intrinsic pathway which is fol-lowed by activation of cascade of caspase enzymes (Chou et al., 2007).      Extrinsic pathwayThe extrinsic mechanism of apoptosis is characterized by activation of the external cell surface receptors, name-ly TRAIL (Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) and DR (death receptor, Fas/CD95), lead-ing to downstream caspase-mediated apoptosis (Codesido et al., 2014). These receptors can be activated by a signal that activates the enzymes procaspase 8 and 3, and there-fore consequently triggers the apoptosis of cells. The num-ber of studies, which included the extrinsic pathway into the mechanism of capsaicin mediated apoptosis, is much lower than numbers of reported studies which indicated the intrinsic pathway as the main mechanism of apoptosis. Moon et al., 2012 notified that capsaicin induced the surface expression of TRAIL-receptor D5 through the acti-vation of SP1 due to a calcium influx-dependent SP1 (spe-cific protein 1) in kidney cancer cells. In multiple malig-nant glioma cells, subtoxic concentrations of capsaicin sensitized TRAIL-induced apoptosis mediated through ER Stress proteins CHOP/GADD153. DR5 and surviving con-tribute to amplification of the caspase cascade, thus restor-ing TRAIL sensitivity (Kim et al., 2010). S5 PP 235494Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 493 - 494 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsIntrinsic pathway The mechanism of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is distinguished by intracellular activation of apoptosis through intracellular stressors, in which the most common are reactive oxygen species (ROS) and excess intracellu-lar calcium. Disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and alterations in bcl-2, Bax, bcl-xL, and bad proteins, can cause a release of cytochrome C in cell cytosol and subse-quent activation of the caspase cascade. These processes are the initial triggers that are eventually leading to apop-tosis (Zhang et al., 2008). Cytochrom C together with some other factors can induce activation of caspase-9. Activated capsasa-9 can lead to activation of caspasa 3 and 7, which cleaves the inhibitor of caspasa activated DNAase and re-sults in DNA fragmentation. Many studies examining the cytotoxic effects of capsaicin on prostate and other malig-nant cell lines, have reported that capsaicin induced apop-tosis is linked to intrinsic mechanisms.Pramanik et al., (2011) have evaluated the mechanism of capsaicin-mediated ROS generation in pancreatic can-cer cells and they suggested that mitochondrial complex-I and III are involved in capsaicin mediated ROS gener-ation. They demonstrated that capsaicin inhibited the en-zymatic activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dis-mutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione reductase, which resulted in oxidative stress. According to Kryston et al., (2011), the agonistic ef-fect of capsaicin on TRPV1, can evoke intracellular in-flux of calcium, which leads to further intracellular stress, activating apoptosis in various cell lines, namely prostate cancer. They found that the generation of ROS induced by capsaicin correlated with the dissipation of the inner mito-chondrial transmembrane potential and the release of cy-tochrome-c into the cytosol. Activation of the caspase-3 cascade resulted in the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)poly-merase (PARP) and resultant apoptosis. Conclusion A large number of investigators clearly demonstrated that capsaicin inhibits the growth of cancer cells by induc-ing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, but its molecular mech-anisms in some types of cancers are not well understood. Therefore, additional studies are required to elucidate and to supplement the missing part of this data.ReferencesAmantini, C., Mosca, M., Nabissi, M., Lucciarini, R., Caprodossi, S., Arcella, A., Giangaspero, F., Santoni, G., 2007.

This paper presents the results obtained by Quality Control division of Pharmanova, during the qualification and selection process of raw material suppliers. The requirement specified for the quality of the extract used in Oestrofact E capsules is: at least 40% of total isoflavones, calculated on a dried basis. After reviewing the official scientific literature, the testing of samples, sent by the manufacturers/suppliers was performed. Monographs for the herbal drug (Powdered Red Clover), herbal extract (Powdered Red Clover Extract) and final product (Red Clover Tablets), that were consulted, have been published by the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP36/NF31, 2013). The monograph for Powdered Red Clover Extract states the isoflavone content should be not less than 90% and not more than 110% of the declared amount, calculated on the dried basis as the sum of daidzein, genistein, formononetin and biochanin A content.Materials and methodsTest samples of red clover dry extracts with appropri-ate documentation (specifications, certificates, production flow charts) were collected from three manufacturers. The samples were tested for the individual content of each iso-flavone (daidzein, genistein, formononetin and biochanin A) as well as the total isoflavone content. One of the sam-ples was also tested for homogeneity dependant on the sampling position (bottom, top, middle, centre, left, and right).The method used for the identification and determination of isoflavones in red clover extract was developed in physico-chemical laboratory of Quality Control (QC) Pharmanova, and validated according to ICH guidelines. The technique used is HPLC with UV-VIS detector (254 nm). Separation is achieved using a Phenomenex\u00ae Luna C18 (2), 250 x 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle column, at isocratic elution at 1 mL/min, using the following mobile phase: acetonitrile: 0.5% phosphoric acid (40:60, V/V).Results and discussionIndividual and total isoflavone content was determined in three test samples. The results presented in percentage (%, m/m) represent the average of two consecutive results of the same sample:1. Test sample I: daidzein 0.52%, genistein 0.51%, formononetin: 19.99%, biochianin A 11.31%, total isoflavones 32.33%2. Test sample II: daidzein 9.26%, genistein 11.29%, formononetin: 17.80%, biochianin A 3.66%, total isoflavones 42.01%3. Test sample III: daidzein 3.38%, genistein 8.72%, formononetin: 15.53%, biochianin A 18.25%, total isoflavones 45.80%In order to get information on the homogeneity, one of the extract was sampled from different positions of the S5 PP 236496Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 495 - 496 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsbulk package. The total isoflavone content was determined from each of the samples and the results were as follows, top: 43.38%; bottom: 44.21%; middle center: 43.36%; middle left: 42.77%; middle right: 43.87%. When the results were statistically processed, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was found to be 0.54%, while the recovery percentage in relation to the declared value was in the range from 98.25% to 101.65%.The estrogenic activity of red clover extract originates from its isoflavones: genistein and diadzein (called soy isoflavons, due to high contents in soy products), and two structurally similar, methylated isoflavons, biochanin A and formononetin. In fact, Biochanin A is methylated genistein, and formononetin methylated daidzein, so after oral application and demethylation in the digestive tract, only genistein and daidzein are found as active metabolites in the organism (Toleson et al., 2002). What remains the question is whether demethylation can occur during one of the dry extract production phases, as well as later during storage and sample manipulation. Thus, during the quality assessment of the extract, the ratio between individual isoflavones should be considered. The U.S. Pharmacopoeia, within HPLC identification, sets requirements for quantitative ratio between two 5,7-dihydroxyisoflavones (biochanin A and genistein) and two 7-hydroxyisoflavones, to be between 0.1 and 10.0.The information collected, concerning the quality of world renowned brands used in clinical research and available in electronic databases indicate that in these products more than 75% of total isoflavone content comes from biochanin A and formononetin, while soy isoflavons (genistein and daidzein) represent a significantly smaller percentage:\u2022\t Promensil\u00ae capsule, 43.5 mg: biochanin A 26 mg (60%), formononetin 16 mg (37%), genistein 1 mg (2%) and daidzein 0.5 mg (1%) (Knight et al., 1999)\u2022\t Rimostil\u00ae capsule, 28.6 mg: formononetin 27 mg (87%), biochanin A 2 mg (7%), genistein and daidzein in trace amounts (Schult et al., 2004)When all is considered, the ratio of peaks from the chromatogram could indicate a possible attempt to falsi-fy the extract. It is preferable for the peaks of formonone-tin and biochanin A to stand out in relation to ones coming from genistein and daidzein.ConclusionTest sample I contains satisfactory levels of formononetin and biochanin, but low total isoflavone content (< 40%).Test samples II and III comply with requirements for total isoflavone content (> 40%), but high levels of genistein and daidzein can indicate that the extracts were not pure red clover.Requirements for the ratio between pairs of related isoflavones (B + G / D + F) were met by all of the extract samples, in accordance with USP/NF31 (0.1 to 10.0).The total isoflavone content results in samples taken from different positions of the bulk package show no statistically significant difference (RSD < 2 and recovery < \u00b1 3%), which confirms the homogeneity of the tested extract.

Only few species produce essential oil (glandular goosefoots) usu-ally with characteristic chemical composition. In Europe, glandular goosefoot is Chenopodium botrys L. (syn. Dys-phania botrys (L.) Mosyakin and Clemants) known as Je-rusalem Oak Goosefoot, native to the Mediterranean re-gion. The plant has been used for treatment of catarrh and humoral asthma and is known as a good substitute for the traditionally known medicinal plant Chenopodium ambro-sioides (Yadav et al., 2007). C. botrys contains flavonoids, alkaloids and terpe-noids. The characteristic odor of the plant is due to some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes which were found to be responsible for the specific aromatic and fetid scent. The presence of some oxygen-containing sesquiterpenes was correlated with pronounced antibacterial and antifungal activity (Kokanova-Nedialkova et al., 2009). Studies on the flavonoids revealed presence of flavonols: chrysoeriol, quercetin, kaempferol and herbacetin and flavones: hispid-ulin, salvigenin, 5-methylsalvigenin, 7-methyleupatulin, sinensetin and jaceosidin (Morteza-Semnani, 2015). Dried herbal part of C. botrys is used from local peo-ple in Republic of Macedonia (RM) for preparing infusions or liquid extracts with diuretic, antispasmodic, carminative and antidiarrheal properties. The aim of this study was de-termination of the chemical composition of Macedonian C. botrys and evaluation of its antimicrobial capacity.Materials and methodsThe aerial flowering parts (herba) of C. botrys, were collected in the period from July to September in 2012, 2013 and 2014 from five localities in RM: 1.

Collect-ed plant material was air-dried and preserved in paper bags until analysis, when it was minced and homogenised ap-propriately.The essential oil was isolated with steam distillation using all-glass Clevenger type apparatus according to the method listed in the monograph in the European pharma-copoeia. Essential oil samples were analysed on Agilent 7890\u0410 Gas Chromatography system equipped with FID detector and Agilent 5975C Mass Quadrupole detector using previ-ously published method (Adji Andov et al., 2014). Hydrolyzed extract of C. botrys herba was prepared according to the method listed in the monograph in the Eu-ropean pharmacopoeia and were analyzed using an Agile-nt 1200 series HPLC system equipped with a G1315D pho-to-diode array detector, controlled by ChemStation LC 3D software. Chromatographic separations were carried out on a XDB-C18 Eclipse column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, Ag-ilent Technologies, USA). Spectral data for all peaks were accumulated in the range of 190-400 nm and chromato-grams were recorded at 260, 280, 330 and 370 nm. Antimicrobial activity. Microbial strains: Staphylococ-cus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Candida albicans ATCC 10259 and clinical isolates from patients (Enterococcus, Strepto-coccus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enteriti-S5 PP 237498Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 497 - 498 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsdis) were used. Method: Disc diffusion method was used in order to determine the growth inhibition zones of the mi-croorganisms. The results were compared to the antimicro-bial activity of several antibiotic drugs. Preparation of ex-tracts: methanol extracts (1 g/mL) were prepared using ul-trasonic assisted extraction procedure.    Results and discussionThe results of the GC/FID/MS analysis showed that the main compounds of the essential oil of C. botrys herba were the sesquiterpenes: elemol acetate, saline-11-en-4\u03b1-ol, selina-3,11-diene-6\u03b1-ol and elemol, followed by low-er content of \u03b1-eudesmol acetate, \u03b1-henopodiol, botrydiol and \u03b1-chenopodiol-6-acetate. These compounds represent-ed 62.74-81.21% of the oil. Additionally more than 50 oth-er compounds were identified in very low quantities or in traces. The monoterpene ascaridol was absent. In hydrolyzed extract of C. botrys herba, hydroxycin-namic acid, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid and its de-rivate were identified together with quercetin and isorh-amnetin. Tentatively apigenin and luteolin were identified, based on comparison of the Rt and UV-DAD spectra with those of the authentic substances of apigenin and luteolin, used as referent flavonoids. The component that appeared in the HPLC chromatogram on Rt 24.7 min has UV-DAD spectra with UVmax on 348 nm and was assume to be her-bacetin.Methanol extracts of C. botrys herba showed promis-ing antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, and no activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella en-teritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Additionally the extract showed promising antifungal ac-tivity against Candida albicans. Obtained results are in ac-cordance with the literature data. The essential oil isolated from C. botrys from differ-ent regions in the world contains varying chemical compo-sition where dominant components are the sesquiterpenes, mainly \u03b1- and \u03b2-chenopodiol, eudesma-3,11-dien-6\u03b1-ol, botrydiol, elemol, elemol acetate, \u03b1- \u03b2- and \u03b3-eudesmol and new identified compound guaia-3,9-dien-11-ol, that was also identified in our oil. Some authors point out on higher presence of other sesquiterpenes such as \u03b1-cadinol, epi-\u03b1-muurolol, cubenol and E-caryophyllene, while some other identified higher percentages of monoterpenes \u03b3-terpineol, \u03b2-myrcene, p-cymene, \u03b1-terpinene, limonene, and espe-cially ascaridole which were reported in essential oils of C. botrys from Spain and Slovakia (Morteza-Semnani, 2015). According Kokanova-Nedialkova et al. (2009) Cheno-podium species contain phenol derivatives such as alco-hols, aldexydes and glycosides (vanillic alcohol and vanil-lic acid, phenolic glycoside named chenoalbuside, cinnam-ic, sinapic and ferulic acid and their derivatives, hydroxy-cinnamic acylglycosides and many other phenolic com-pounds. In the group of flavonoids, quercetin, isorhamne-tin, kaempferol and herbacetin and their glycosides were the only flavonols isolated from Chenopodium species, in-cluding C. botrys, besides highly metylated flavons: salvi-genin, sinensetin, hispidulin and their derivatives. Up to now, antimicrobial activity was tested only on the essential oil of C. botrys, which expressed signifi-cant bactericidal activity against selected strains of Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria, comparable to that of the ref-erence antibiotics amicacin and cephotaxim (Kokanova-Nedialkova et al. 2009) and significant fungicidal activi-ty against selected strains of Aspergillus niger and Candi-da albicans, comparable to that of the reference antibiotics nystatine and amphotericin (Tzakou et al., 2007).ConclusionIn the essential oil chemical composition of Macedo-nian Chenopodium botrys as predominant compounds were determinate the oxygen-containing sesquiterpenes: elemol, eudesmol, chenopodiol and seline alcohols and their esters. The hydrolysed extract contained few phenolic acids, pre-dominantly, cinnamic and caffeic acid and their derivates and quercetin, isorhamnetin, apigenin, luteolin and proba-bly herbacetin. Methanol extracts show promising antimi-crobial and antifungal activity. Further investigations are required for complete chemical identification of phenolic and flavonoid compounds as well as to reveal the antimi-crobial and antifungal capacity of the plant extract, for fur-ther medicinal or commercial use.ReferencesAdji Andov, L., Karapandzova, M., Cvetkovikj, I., Stefkov, G., Kulevanova, S., 2014.

Macedonia* bube.petrovska@yahoo.comIntroductionThe chemical compounds present in the living organ-isms are composed of chemical elements. In these days al-most 120 chemical elements are known and 30 of them create the living matter, therefore are known as biogenic elements. Plants provide themselves with elements from air, soil and water. They are present within the compounds or in the form of ions and in some special cases they are unbound (e.g. oxygen). According to their representation in organisms, the biogenic elements are divided into three groups: macro-biogenic, micro-biogenic and trace ele-ments. Macro-biogenic elements (C, O, H, N, S, P, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, Fe) have a building function, micro-biogen-ic elements (Cu, I, Mo, Mn, Zn, Co) are parts of enzymes and their function is catalytic, while trace elements (Al, As, B, Br, F, Li, Ni, Se, Si, Ti, V) are presented less than 0.001% and their biological role still remain undiscovered. The content of these elements vary a lot depending on many factors. Nevertheless, edible plant represent biologi-cal source of these elements for other living organisms in-cluding humans. Thus, Chenopodium spp. (Amaranthace-ae) is being used as a leafy vegetable and subsidiary grain crop in different parts of the world due to its rich nutrition-al quality and its ability to grow in stress conditions.  The Chenopodium genus comprises numerous species of perennial and annual plants that grow as herbaceous plant or as shrubs and small trees. In the flora of the Re-public of Macedonia (RM), 15 species of this genus oc-cur including C. botrys and C. album. Dried herbal parts of C. botrys are used from local people for preparing infu-sions or liquid extracts with diuretic, antispasmodic, car-minative and antidiarrheal properties while fresh leaves of C. album are known as substitute of some green leafy veg-etables such as spinach. These two plant species have not been issue of chemical characterisation so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was determination of the content of selected biogenic elements of wild samples of C. botrys and C. album, collected from different localities of the Re-public of Macedonia.Materials and methodsPlant material (25 specimens), consisting of aerial flowering part (herba) and dried roots (radix) of two Che-nopodium species (C. album and C. botrys), was collect-ed from wild specimens on different localities in R. Mace-donia, during 2012 and 2013. Collected plant material was air-dried and preserved in paper bags until analysis, when it was minced and homogenised appropriately.For mineralization purposes 0.5 g of plant material were placed in a Teflon digestion vessels (OMNI/xp 1500), 7 mL (69%, m/V) HNO3 and 2 mL H2O2 (30%, m/V) were added, the vessels were capped closed, and after 24 hours were placed in the rotor of the Mars microwave digestion (CEM, USA). The digestion was carried out on 180 \u00b0C in S5 PP 238500Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 499 - 500 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationstwo steps, first 25 min and then additional 15 min. The digests were filtered on filter paper (Munktell, Sweden), quantitatively transferred to 25 mL calibrated flasks, dilut-ed with demineralised water and analyzed for the select-ed elements.All analyzed elements (Ca, K, Mg, P, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) were determined by the application of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) (Varian, 715-ES) applying an ultrasonic nebulizer CETAC (ICP/U-5000AT+) for better sensitivity. The optimal in-strumental parameters for this technique were published previously (Balabanova et al., 2010). All results were cal-culated on a dry mass basis (mg/kg d.m.). Samples were made in triplicates. Each data represents the mean \u00b1 2 stan-dard deviation of three samples.Results and discussionThe two analyzed species of Chenopodium contained large amounts of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P), which ranged from 961 mg/kg for P to 40907 mg/kg for K, in dried aerial flowering part (herba) of C. botrys and C. album. The most abundant macro-biogenic element in all analysed samples of herba was K (14136-40907 mg/kg), followed by Ca (7405-14146 mg/kg), Mg (1082-5913 mg/kg) and P (961-2752 mg/kg). The content of micro-biogenic elements in herba of C. al-bum and C. botrys was much lower, ranging from 4.0 mg/kg for Cu to 863.1 mg/kg for Fe. The most abundant mi-cro-biogenic element in the investigated samples of herba was Fe (33.3-863.1 mg/kg), followed by Na (14.6-606.0 mg/kg), Mn (9.4-177.8 mg/kg), Zn (11.8-27.9 mg/kg) and Cu (4.0-15.6 mg/kg). The content of macro-biogenic elements in roots (ra-dix) of C. album and C. botrys was lower when compared with the herba of both species, ranging from 589 mg/kg for P to 15839 mg/kg for K. The most abundant macro-bio-genic element in all analysed samples from radix was K (14136-40907 mg/kg), followed by Ca (7405-14146 mg/kg), Mg (1082-5913 mg/kg) and P (961-2752 mg/kg). The content of micro-biogenic elements in radix of C. album and C. botrys was lower than in herba, ranging from 4.0 mg/kg for Cu to 863.1 mg/kg for Fe. Fe was also the most abundant micro-biogenic element in all investigated spec-imens of radix (33.3-863.1 mg/kg), followed by Na (14.6-606.0 mg/kg), Mn (9.4-177.8 mg/kg), Zn (11.8-27.9 mg/kg) and Cu (4.0-15.6 mg/kg).    According to literature data Bomkazi et al. (2013) found very high amount of K in young shoots and mature plant-leaves of C. album, (45799.3 mg/kg and 49028.6 mg/kg, respectively), while the contents of Ca and Mg were lower. Comparing to our results, the content of K, Ca and Mg was higher than in our Macedonian samples from herba of C. album. Smaller amounts of Fe (218.1 and 120.4 mg/kg), Zn (26.2 and 23.0 mg/kg) and Cu (14.0 and 9.1 mg/kg) were found also in young shoots and mature plant-leaves, respectively. In leaves of Indian C. album 452 mg/100 g K was found, followed by 150 mg/100 g Ca, and smaller amounts of Na, Mg, Zn, and Fe (43.0, 34.0, 24.0 and 4.2 mg/100 g, respectively) (Dey et al., 2013). Obtained results for Macedonian C. album were in accordance with litera-ture data. According to literature, C. botrys was found to be very good bio-accumulator of heavy metals, especially for Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu, which content rich up to 4145, 175, 276 and 56 mg/kg, respectively (Malayeri et al., 2008).   ConclusionThe content of biogenic elements in investigated Che-nopodium species (C. album and C. botrys) from Macedo-nian flora, showed that in both species the most abundant macro-biogenic element was K, in the dried aerial flower-ing part (herba) as well as in the dried roots (radix), fol-lowed by high amounts of Ca, Mg and P. Fe was predom-inant micro-biogenic element, present in higher amounts in the herba of C. botrys. Both species represent biologi-cal source of Mn, Zn and Cu. Differences in the contents of biogenic elements were high, depending on the harvesting locations. Further investigations are needed for analyzing the environmental influence on the contents of biogenic el-ements in Chenopodium species.

The different parts of this plant are frequently used in traditional medicine in order to treat several diseases such as skin infections, urinary troubles, insomnia and anxiety, digestive disorders, obesity, urinary troubles, diabetes, etc. (Bakhtaoui et al., 2014). Recent studies stipulate onto the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-ulcerogenic activities of aqueous extracts of some parts of this plant on rodents, as well as on the immunomodulatory properties on human T-cell activation, and on IL-2 mRNA expression (Benammar et al., 2014). In order to investigate more thoroughly onto the properties of Zizyphus lotus L., a study dealing with the qualitative evaluation of different methanolic extracts of this plant (originating from roots, stems, leaves and seeds), as well as of their antioxidant properties was carried on. Materials and methodsAll reagents were purchased from Merck and Sigma\u2013Aldrich and were of analytical grade. Different parts (leaves, roots, stems and seeds) of Zizyphus lotus L. were collected from north-western Tunisia (Bousalem region) at different times of the year (March, September and October), in 2014. The vegetal materials were grounded into powder and were packed in polythene bags for further use. The methanol extracts of different parts of the plant were prepared in a similar manner. An amount of ten grams (10 g) of ground samples (leaves, stems, root and seeds respectively) were extracted with 100 mL methanol in a Soxhlet extractor. Several extraction processes were carried on. The obtained extracts were filtered and then concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The residues were stored in a refrigerator at 4 \u00b0C until the time of extract use. The qualitative evaluation of the different extracts of Zizyphus lotus was carried on by means of phytochemical screening (for alkaloids, saponnins, terpenes, tannins, quinones, and flavonoids) and thin layer chromatography, using a series of specific standards (catechin, rutine, quercitine, gallic and tannic acids). Determinations were carried out in accordance with procedures described in literature. In order to quantify the total phenol content, the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was used. The antiradical activities of the methanolic extracts of Zizyphus lotus was estimated using the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-pycrylhydrazyl (DPPH), according to the method of Brand-Williams et al. (1995). Rutine and butyl hydroxyl toluene were used as positive controls.Results and discussionThe phytochemical analysis of the methanol extracts of the different parts (leaves, stems, root and seeds respec-tively) of Zizyphus lotus revealed that all of these contain (in different amounts) saponnins, terpens, tannins and fla-vonoids. The roots, stems and seeds also contain sterols. Excepting the leaves, coumarins and alkaloids were de-tected only in traces. The obtained results showed that the fruit seeds should be considered a source of fatty acids, be-S5 PP 239502Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 501 - 502 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsing by far richer in saturated and poly saturated fatty acids than any other parts of the plant. In the case of the roots of Zizyphus lotus, the phytochemical results revealed a rich content in flavonoids, tannins and saponnins, compounds known for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. The same active compounds (flavonoids, saponins, tannins and alkaloids) detected in the Zizyphus lotus leaves, could explain the analgesic effects of this plant and its use in folk medicine. The analysis of the thin layer chromatographic plates revealed the presence of polyphenols, catechin, ru-tine, quercitin, tannic and gallic acids in the different parts of Zizyphus lotus.Regarding the antioxidant activity of the methanolic extracts originating from the different parts of Zizyphus lo-tus, it was found that the obtained efficient concentration values (IC50) ranged from 4.713 to 6.704 \u03bcg/mL, being sig-nificantly lower as compared to the positive controls: butyl hydroxyl toluene (21.441 \u03bcg/mL) and rutine (13.762 \u03bcg/mL). So, one could notice that the studied extracts show an important antioxidant activity. Among all, the seeds metha-nol extract showed an antioxidant activity five times great-er than butyl hydroxyl toluene\u2019s one, and three times great-er that the rutine\u2019s one. ConclusionThe phytochemical screening of the methanolic ex-tracts originating from different parts of Zizyphus lotus L. revealed the presence of some active compounds such as saponnins, terpenes, tannins, quinones and flavonoids. This content in active compounds confirms the importance of Zizyphus lotus L. in folk medicine, which could be con-sidered as a natural alternative to some synthetic products. The methanol extracts of different parts of Zizyphus lo-tus L. showed an important antioxidant activity. According to the obtained efficient concentration values, one could conclude that the seed\u2019s methanolic extract has the highest antioxidant activity as compared to the leaves, stems and roots extracts, as well as to the positive controls (rutine and butyl hydroxyl toluene) used in this study.ReferencesBakhtaoui, F.Z., Lakmichi, H., Megraud, F., Chait, A., Gadhi, C.E.A., 2014.

Macedonia* marijakarapandzova@yahoo.comIntroductionPines are among the most important and widespread forest trees as they occur in a different range of environ-mental and climate conditions (Naydenov et al., 2006). Pinus nigra Arnold or black pine is a moderately variable species which grows widely throughout Mediterranean and is attributed to Balkan Peninsula as well as Republic of Macedonia where this conifer could be found on several localities (Karadzica, Kozuf, Shara Mountain etc.).Essential oils isolated from different pine species are widely used as fragrances in cosmetic industry, as fla-voring additives for food and beverages and as scenting agents in a variety of household products and intermediates in the synthesis of perfume chemicals (Sezik et al., 2010). Since antiquity, they have been known to possess biologi-cal activity, most notably antibacterial, antifungal and an-tioxidant properties therefore are used in the ethno medi-cal practice and in the folk medicine throughout the world. Moreover, pine oils are used for medical purposes in aro-matherapy as carminative, rubefacient, emmenagogue and even as abortifacient agents. Additionally, the systematic and potential usefulness of essential oil studies has become increasingly important because of their growing interest in use in both the food and pharmaceutical industries (Kil-ic and Kocak, 2014). In this way, the chemistry and the bi-ological activity of the essential oils isolated from differ-ent pine species have been intensively studied, particularly needles essential oils. However, despite the abundant literature on this topic, there are no evident data about the chemistry and biolog-ical activity of Macedonian black pine, thus the main ob-jective of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oils isolated from needles and to access their antimicrobial activity against certain types of microorganisms in order to define possible application and therapeutic uses of these essential oils as antimicrobi-al agents.Materials and methodsPlant material (terminal branches) was collected from two different localities in R. Macedonia (Kozuf and Nidze) and was dried at room temperature, for two weeks. Just be-fore isolation, the needles were separated from the branch-es and were properly minced. Essential oil isolation was made by steam distillation in all-glass Clevenger apparatus (Ph.Eur. 8, 2.8.12.). For that purpose, 20 g of minced needles were distilled for 4 hours. For purification purpose, anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to the isolated essential oil to remove residu-al water. For GC/FID/MS analysis, the essential oil was dis-solved in xylene to obtain 1 \u03bcl/ml oil solution.Essential oil samples were analyzed on Agilent 7890\u0410 Gas Chromatography system equipped with FID detector and Agilent 5975C Mass Quadrupole detector according to previously published method by Karapandzova et al. (Karapandzova, 2014).Antimicrobial activity of essential oils was studied against 14 different microorganisms, including 13 bacterial isolates representing both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Strepto-coccus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococ-S5 PP 240504Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 503 - 504 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationscus pyogenes and Enterococcus) and Gram-negative bacte-ria (Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli ATCC 25927, Sal-monella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Haemophilus in-fluenzae and Proteus mirabilis) and one strain of Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Antimicrobial screening of all test-ed essential oils was made by disc diffusion and broth di-lution method previously described by Karapandzova et al. (2014).Results and discussionThe total needle essential oil content of Macedonian black pine calculated on anhydrous dried mass yielded from 8.03 to 8.34 ml/kg.    Data analysis of the chemical composition of exam-ined essential oil samples revealed six different class-es of components: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenat-ed monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenat-ed sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and other non-terpene com-ponents. The most abundant fraction in the essential oil isolated from needles of Pinus nigra collected from Ko-zuf were monoterpene hydrocarbons (39.96%), while ses-quiterpenes were declared as dominant (46.45%) in the oil samples isolated from Pinus nigra from Nidze. This vari-ability in chemical composition of Macedonian black pines is probably due to the influence of environmental condi-tions on the biosynthesis of terpene compounds.Total of eighty nine components were identified in the investigated essential oil samples which represent-ed 87.63% of total oil. Predominant components were monoterpenes: \u03b1-pinene (29.23-30.51%), \u03b2-pinene (1.44-5.30%) and limonene + \u03b2-phellandrene (1.34-1.85%) and sesquiterpenes: trans-(E)-caryophyllene (8.56-11.38%), \u03b3-murrolene (0.98-2.11%) and germacrene D (17.32-21.21%).Previously established differences in the essential oil composition presumably affect their antimicrobial activity. In this regard, essential oil isolated from needles of black pine collected from Nidze has showed antimicrobial activ-ity towards Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus agalactiae. Additionally, essential oil isolated from black pine needles from Kozuf revealed good antimicrobial ac-tivity against to another three microorganisms as they have showed strong antimicrobial effects toward Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for tested essential oil samples ranged from 15.25 to 62.25 \u03bcl/ml de-pending on the microorganism. According to literature data, essential oils isolated from needles of Macedonian black pine have showed the greatest similarity to the chemical composition of oils ob-tained from needles of black pines originating from Croatia and Greece with the exception of two components, 13-epi-manool oxide (2.25%) which was identified in the oil of Croatian black pine (Idzojtic et al., 2005) and 3-methyl-2-phenyl ester of butyric acid (2.10%) found in essential oils isolated from black pine from Greece (Roussis et al., 1994). Data concerning the antimicrobial activity of Pinus nigra essential oils indicated that there are no available published studies regarding this species. In terms of anti-microbial activity of the essential oils isolated from other pines, it is evident that it\u2019s in a direct correlation with the chemical composition and largely depends on the domi-nant components present in the oil.ConclusionMacedonian black pines contain essential oil with pre-dominant components \u03b1- and \u03b2-pinene and have showed good antimicrobial activity against selected Gram (+) bac-teria as well as Candida albicans. Nevertheless, further studies will be aimed in order to obtain more data about their antimicrobial potential as well as data about their safety usage until their final recommendation as antimicro-bial agents.ReferencesIdzojtic, M., Kajba, D., Franjic, J., 2005.

(Cupressaceae) (juniper) is coniferous evergreen tree or shrub, with needle-like leaves and berry-like cones, usually incorrectly consider as berry fruit. Actually, the plant grows as male and female plant and produce male and female cones, but only female cones are used as medicinal source for isolation of juniper oil (Juniperi aetherolem), valuable natural product for many purposes. The medicinal use of the juniper essential oil comprises: diuretic, antiseptic, digestive, stomachic and antireumathic activity, while commercial purposes include uses in food industry, in production of alcohol beverages, as well as, cosmetics and perfume production. The oil possesses specific chemical composition where as predominant components are considered the monoterpene hydrocarbons (\u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, \u03b2-myrcene, sabinene and limonene), followed by the fraction of oxygen-containing monoterepenes (EMA/HMPC/12401/2010), where terpinene-4-ol is considered to be responsible for the diuretic effect of the juniper oil (Chatzapoulou and Kastsiotis, 1993; Orav et al., 2010). The oil composition is highly variable, and depends on genetic and environmental factors (source, geographical origin, maturity of the berries, age of the plant, environmental factors) (Jo and Kim, 2005; Tasic et al., 1993). Furthermore, the differences in the essential oil chemical composition usually trigger variations in its activity.    Over the years, the juniper berries and the juniper berry essential oil are natural drugs that are commercially exploited and exported from Republic of Macedonia (RM). Regarding this, the aim of the present work was determination of the chemical composition and possible chemical variability of the isolated juniper oils from wild growing plants in RM.Materials and methodsSamples of juniper berries were collected in late au-tumn in 2010, 2011 and 2012 from six regions in RM (North-West Mountain - Mtn.: Bistra Mtn., and Shara Mtn.; Central Mtn.: Karadzica, Jakupica, and Dautica; Porechie: Kichevo, Makedonski Brod, and Samokov; Pelagonija re-gion: Bitola, Pelister, Prilep, and Resen; Black Drim re-gion: Debar, Karaorman, and Velestovo, and Maleshevija: Berovo). The collected plant material was air dried, stored at cool, and dark place, until analysis.   The essential oils were isolated by steam-distillation in the Clevenger-type apparatus according to the method de-scribed in the Ph.Eur.8.0 (2014). The oils were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and stored in vials in refrigera-tor until analysis.Essential oil samples were analyzed with Agilent 7890\u0410 Gas Chromatography system equipped with flame ionization detector (FID), and Agilent 5975C Mass Quad-ripole detector. For this purpose, an HP-5ms (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 \u03bcm) capillary column was used. Operating conditions and identification of the components were previously published (Sela et al., 2011). Microsoft Excel\u00ae (Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA, USA) was used for obtained data tabulation, while multi-variate statistical analysis software SIMCA 14 (Unimetrics S5 PP 241506Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 505 - 506 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsAB, Sweden) was used for depth analysis. Values of p less than 0.05 were considered significant.Results and discussionWith GC/FID/MS, 93 components were determinate in the essential oil isolated from juniper berries from all geographic regions in RM. The juniper oil was composed mainly from monoterpene hydrocarbons: \u03b1-pinene (15.59-43.68%), \u03b2-myrcene (2.89-26.50%), sabinene (1.65-16.34%), and \u03b2-pinene (0.00-6.34%). The oxygen-containing monoterpene, terpinen-4-ol was presented from 0.02-4.35%. In addition, some sesquiterpene compounds were also important constituents of the oil and were present in larger percentages (germacrene D 1.25-12.89%; trans-E-caryophyllene 1.61-4.05% and \u03b1-humulene 1.61-4.60%). The analysed essential oils showed differences in the chemical composition. According literature data, differences and variability in the composition of juniper oil originated from different regions in Europe and America were already reported. \u03b1-Pinene was declared as main constituent present from 27.00% in the Greek samples, over 28.60-38.20% in samples from Montenegro, and up to 46.63% in the Iranian samples (Rezvani, 2010). Other important components such as sabinene, germacrene D, myrcene, \u03b2-pinene and limonene were found in different amounts. Having in mind that chemical composition in vari-ous samples of the essential oil mostly differs due to the influence of temperature, and/or geographic region (Jo and Kim, 2005), in depth statistical analyses using prin-cipal component analysis (PCA), followed by Hierarchi-cal Cluster Analysis (HCA) (calculated with Ward`s crite-rion and sorted by size), partial least square - discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and partial least square (PLS) analysis were carried out. PCA applied on data related to all 93 identified con-stituents of the oil resulted with mathematical model with six principal components that explained 99.5% of the total variations, with no identified outliers in the model. Den-drogram created by subsequent HCA pointed that analyzed samples could be clustered in two groups.The samples in the first cluster were correlated with \u03b1-pinene and \u03b2-myrcene, while the second cluster was linked to germacrene D, \u03b2-elemene, trans-E-caryophyllene, \u03b1-humulene, \u03b3-elemene, \u03b2-cadinene, \u03b3-cadinene. PLS-DA preceded PLS analysis with a rationale for discriminatory variables identification. Nine components (germacrene D, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-myrcene, sabinene, \u03b1-humulene, \u03b2-elemene, trans-E-caryophyllene, \u03b3-elemene and \u03b3-cadinene) showed statistical significance and hence were identified as discriminatory variables.  Conducted PLS analysis pointed to the relation of discriminatory variables with the year and  geographical region of harvesting, as well as the mean maximal, mean average and mean minimal temperature in the month of collection (October). The PLS analysis suggested a model with four components that explained 94% (R2Y) of the variables with prediction (Q2) of 90.2%. Statistical analysis of the results enabled determination of significant variables and establishment of correlation between the oil chemical compositions and/or the harvesting year, geographical region and mean temperature values. ConclusionThe GC/MS analyses of the chemical composition of the essential oils isolated from the berries of Macedonian juniper revealed presence of 93 components in total. HCA resulted with dendrogram where the samples were grouped in two clusters, one correlated with two monoterpene hy-drocarbons, and second with the sesquiterpene hydrocar-bons fraction. With PLS-DA, nine discriminatory variables were identified with statistical significance. Generally, the chemical composition of the juniper oil from RM is affect-ed by the temperature and/or the year of harvesting.ReferencesAssessment report on Juniperus communis L., aetheroleum, EMA/HMPC/12401/2010.Chatzapoulou, P., Kastsiotis, S.T., 1993.

Although there are around 1000 species of Salvia, only the pharmacopoe-ial herbs (Salvia officinalis L. and Salvia fruticosa Mill-er) have significant commercial importance (Dincer et al., 2013).Essential oil, polyphenols and terpenes are considered as main chemical compounds responsible for the pharma-cological activity of these species (Kintzios, 2000; Ramos et al., 2010).S. fruticosa (Greek sage) is an endemic species of the Eastern Mediterranean basin and is the most widespread sage species in Greece (Kintzios, 2000; Ramos et al., 2010). The leaves of this herb have been used for treat-ment of various skin, blood, and infectious ailments (Ali-Shtayeh et al., 2000) while the essential oil is effective against different microorganisms. Greek sage posses hy-poglycemic effect and can be used against inflammations, hepatitis, and tuberculosis (Pitarokili et al., 2003). However, the most studies have focused on the essen-tial oil, while there are few reports regarding the phenolic composition (Kintzios, 2000). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the polyphenolic profile of 15 different wild growing pop-ulations of S. fruticosa from Greece and Albania. Materials and methodsPlant material (Salvia fruticosa Mill., Lamiaceae), was collected from 15 different indigenous populations from nine different locations from Greece (Kavoussi - 2, Rhi-zoscaro - 2, and Vrysses - 2) and Albania (Porto Palermo-Qeparo - 4, Llogora -1 , Dhermi - 1, Borsh - 1, Ilias Vuno - 1, and Palase - 1). The leaves were air dried, packed in pa-per bags and kept in a dark and cold place until analysis. Plant identity was verified and voucher specimens were de-posited at the Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Phar-macy, Skopje, R. Macedonia.The 70% methanolic extracts were prepared in ultra-sonic bath by the method described by Cvetkovikj et al. (2013).Qualitative analysis was carried out using an HPLC system from the Agilent 1100 series with photo-diode ar-ray and mass detector (G2445A Ion-Trap Mass Spectrom-eter) equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) (Ag-ilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany), controlled by LCMSD software (Agilent, v.4.1). MS data were acquired in the negative ionization mode. The eluents were: formic acid (1%, V/V) (A) and acetonitrile (B) and the separations were achieved using the method established by Cvetkovikj et al. (2013), on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB RP C-18 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, Agilent, Germany), protected with a guard column (4 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, RP-18, 5 \u03bcm, Ag-ilent, Germany). The phenolic compounds were identified using their UV and mass spectral data (deprotonated mo-lecular ions and their corresponding fragments and losses). S5 PP 242508Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 507 - 508 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsResults and discussionWith HPLC\u2013DAD\u2013ESI-MSn, qualitative character-ization of 15 different extracts from Greek sage was per-formed and a total of 37 different compounds were detect-ed. The detected compounds were classified in five groups: 12 derivates of hydroxycinnamic acid were the predom-inant group, followed by the group of 12 flavone glyco-sides of luteolin or apigenin, six phenolic diterpenes, five flavones and only one flavanone glycosides of hispidulin. Rosmarinic acid together with the flavone, nepetin (6-hydroxyluteolin 6-methyl ether), and the phenolic di-terpene (rosmanol isomer) were detected in all 15 exam-ined S. fruticosa samples. Thirteen compounds (luteo-lin diglucoronide, luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, hydroxyluteolin 7-gucuronide, apigenin 7-O-rutinoside, hispidulin7-O-rutinoside, apigenin 7-O-glu-coside, apigenin glucoronide, salvianolic acid K, rosma-rinic acid, rosmanol isomer, carnosol isomer and eupato-rin) were found in amounts higher than 5.00% in at least one population and were considered as principal compo-nents of the methanolic extracts. Rosmarinic acid was pre-dominant constituent (32.72-59.88%), followed by luteolin 7-O-glucuronide (6.18-19.35%), salvianolic acid K (5.73-21.62%) and rosmanol isomer (1.48-12.56%). Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the 13 polyphenolic compounds detected in the extracts from S. fruticosa from nine different localities from two Balkan countries (Greece and Albania) revealed that there wasn\u2019t a statistically significant difference in the polyphenolic com-position of the S. fruticosa populations, regardless its ori-gin.The obtained results for the polyphenolic characteriza-tion of the methanolic extracts were in accordance with the available literature. Ecarschou et al. (2002) identified ros-marinic acid as major constituent in the ethanolic extracts while hispidulin, savigenin, cirsimaritin and the diterpenes casrnosic acid, carnosol and 12-methoxycarnosic acid were predominant compounds of the ethyl acetate extracts that showed antifungal activity (Exarchou et al., 2015). In eth-yl-acetate and n-butanolic extracts from S. fruticosa from Crete, Greece, rosmarinic acid was not detected but deri-vates of ferulic acid and flavone glycosides as well as de-rivates of luteolin were identified and were considered as dominant components (Atwi et al., 2016).ConclusionWith LC/DAD/ESI-MSn analysis of 15 specimens of S. fruticosa from Greece and Albania, 37 polypheno-lic compounds were detected, where as predominant group were considered the hydroxycinnamic acid derivates, with rosmarinic acid present with more than 30% in all anal-ysed populations. The flavone glycosides of luteolin and apigenin were second dominant group. Qualitative anal-ysis showed no statistically significant difference in the polyphenolic composition indicating that the polypheno-lic profile of S. fruticosa is more species allied rather than locality related.ReferencesAli-Shtayeh, M.S., Yaniv, Z., Mahajna, J., 2000.

Sarajevo, Igmanska 38, 71320 Vogo\u0161\u0107a, Bosnia and Herzegovina* elvira-kb@hotmail.comIntroductionThe value of medicinal plants to the mankind is very well proven. It is estimated that 70 to 80% of the people worldwide rely chiefly on traditional health care system and largely on herbal medicines (Farnsworth and Soejarto, 1991; Shanley and Luz, 2003; Shengji, 2002).Natural medicinal raw material of plant origin has ap-plication in therapy of the all pharmacological indication. More and more, they are taking integral part of the official pharmacy and because of their use in official therapy, they rising to a higher level continually.However, the application of the medicinal plant raw material in dentistry is much smaller. Although, stomatology can be classified as medical or health community, still it has own specifications. For this reason, it can be induced the possibility for using plant ma-terial in treatment of caries, dental plaque, gingivitis, peri-odontal disease. The application is possible for different oral inflammations as they represent anti-inflammatory, an-timicotic and antiviral agent. Furthermore, it is important the possibility for applica-tion, different plant material and their products in prepara-tion for oral hygiene. Permanent progress of stomatology as scientific area results with introduction of a new tech-nology and new synthetic drugs but these impose also the use of potential natural medical raw material.The carriers of pharmacological effects in plant mate-rial are different chemical substances: tannins, flavonoids, saponins, anthraquinones and their products: essential oil, mucus, balsams etc. (Samuelsson, 2004).Accordingly, the aim of this study was assessment of the plant material and the extracted chemical substances capacity in stomatology practice.Material and methodsIn this study 25 different medical plants were presented and additionally was estimated their potential application in stomatology due to their content of chemical defined and pharmacological active substances. Results and discussionFor the purpose of the study, 25 different medical plants were discussed: Ononidis radix is used for rinsing the mouth with toothache due to the triterpenes and flavonoids; Plantaginis radix, used against toothache (iridoids and aucubine); Tormentillae rhizome, for toothache and for oral inflammations, while ground herbal powder is effective for teeth due to tannins; Rubi fruticosi folium, to strengthen the right (flavon glycosides, phenolic acids, galotannines); Solidaginis virgaureae herba is used for inflammation of the oral mucosa as it contains flavonoids (rutin, quercetin); Benzoe tinkinensis, as addition to preparation for mouthwash (benzoic acid); Symphyti radix - mouthwash (tannines, alkaloids, alantoin); Caryophylli flos for toothache for inflammation of the oral mucosa, to reduce local pain and in dentistry (due to the presence of the essential oil components: eugenol, aceteugenol, \u03b2-caryophyllene); Verbasci flos as mouthwash, while the root is used for toothache (iridoid glycosides: aucubin, saponins, flavonoids); Zingiberis rhizome is used as toothpaste and for mouthwash and gargle (gingerol, essential oil components: zingiberen, citral); Caricae S5 PP 243510Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 509 - 510 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsfructus for ulcers treatment; Aloe capensis to treat diseases of the oral cavity (anthracene derivatives); Anisi fructus removes the bad odor from the mouth due to anethole and anisaldehyde; Frangulae cortex can be used against the purulent processes teeth (anthraquinones); Millefolii herba for toothache (essential oil, azulene); Althaeae radix as mouthwash; Capsici fructus, for garglingin inflammation of the mouth and pharynx (capsaicinoids, essential oil, carotenoids); Myrrha for halitosis and also has the potential to strengthen the teeth (essential oil: eugenol, m-cresol, alcohols); Melissae folium against deposits in the mouth and as toothache (essential oil: citronellal, citronellol, nerol, geraniol, citral); Menthae piperitae folium is used as toothpaste (essential oil: menthol, menthone, menthofuran); Chamomillae flos as toothpaste (essential oil: chamazulene, bisabolol, farnesene, flavonoids); Iridis rhizome as tooth powder, (essential oil); Basilici herba as toothpaste (essential oil: 1,8-cineole, linalol, methyl chavicol); Salviae folium as gargling agent and for disinfection of the mouth (essential oil: thujones, 1,8-cineole, borneol) and Aetheroleum Melaleucae for inflammatory processes due to the presence of 1,8-cineole (Heinrich, 2004).Plant products have long been used in dentistry as part of various dental materials right from impression materials to eugenol, which forms an integral part of the dental clinic. The use of herbs in dental practice is not limited to only material sciences. A single herb shows a variety of effects like anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal activity and many more. Hence the incorporation of these herbs in dental practice will prove to be a valuable adjunct in dental treatment.ConclusionThe use of natural medicinal raw materials is constantly increasing. The use in dentistry is not monitored enough. However, the above example of uses of medicinal plant material gives a broad possibility. Phytotherapeutic treatment in dentistry may include all of the most common toothache to the incorporation of the implant.This paper is only an introduction for future clinical and laboratory investigation as a momentum for return to herbal medication in the treatment of different infective diseases in stomatology.ReferencesFarnsworth, N.R., Soejarto, D.D., 1991.

Most of these compounds can be grouped into four major groups: aliphatic compounds, terpenes and terpene derivatives, benzene derivatives and miscellaneous compounds (Oyen and Dung, 1999). They represent the base in the perfume production. However, in the analysis of certain types of perfume, it can be examined from which plant species are used essential oils for their product (Kovac-Besovic, 2001). Essential oil and plant materials containing such oils are natural products of great economic importance. Their main use is in perfumery, cosmetics, flavoring food and drink, for scenting incense and cleaning product (Sarac, 2009). All the world\u2019s leading brands of the highest quality perfumes use not one, but several different essential oils. With their combination, are achieved a number of so-called \u201cfragrance notes\u201d by which they are famous and required. In pharmaceutics, essential oils are used to give drugs an agreeable smell or taste. A few essential oils or pure compounds isolated such oils are used directly as medicines due to their antimicrobial, antifungal or anti-inflammatory activity (Samuelsson, 2004).Thin layer chromatography (TLC) within a short period of time has become most important technique for the identification, characterization and determination of chemical compounds as well as complex mixtures (Nigam et al., 1965). With this technique can be analyzed the chemical substances of natural and synthetic origin (Kovac-Besovic, 2001).Therefore the aim of the present study was to determine and confirm the essential oil components used for perfume production with thin layer chromatography.Materials and methodsIn this study were analysed five different commercial perfumes taken randomly, marked as sample 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The contents written of the label (declaration) of each of the perfume gives the presence of chemical substances that are integral components of different essential oils derived from various plant materials.The label given for perfume No. 1 declared the following components: linalool, geraniol, isoeugenol, limonen, citral, citronelal.The label given for perfume No. 2 declared the following components: linalool, geraniol, citral, citronelal. The label given for perfume No. 3 declared the following components: linalool, geraniol, eugenol, limonen, citral, citronelal.The label given for perfume No. 4 declared the following components: linalool, geraniol, isoeugenol, limonen, citral, citronelal, farnesol.The label given for perfume No. 5 declared the following components: linalool, geraniol, limonen, citral, citronelal.Components of the essential oils and extracts of plant material used as base for perfume production and chromatographic analysis were: Aetheroleum Rosae (geraniol, citronelol), Aetheroleum Lavanulae (linalool), Aetheroleum Citri (citral), Aetheroleum Melissae (citral and citronelal), Aetheroleum Caryophylli (eugenol), Aetheroleum Aurantii floris (farnesol).One mL of different essential oils was diluted with toluene and 5 \u03bcL were used for TLC. Commercial perfumes were prepared in toluene in ratio 1:30 (Wagner and Bladt, 1996).As TLC adsorbent, silica gel GF254 was used, while toluene-ethyl acetate in ratio 93:7 was used as mobile phase for separation of the components from the essential S5 PP 244512Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 511 - 512 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsoils as well as the perfumes. The detected components were visualized under UV lamb on 254 nm and 366 nm, while p-anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid was used as spray reagent.The mobile phase is suitable for the analysis and comparison of all important essential oils, but the plates obtained with chloroform (Melissae folium) and dichlormethane (Caryophylli aetheroleum, Lavandulae aetheroleum), can be used as solvents systems for the drugs and their essential oils.Results and discussionPreliminary experiments were done on five randomly provided perfumes to determine and confirm the nature of constituents present (declared on the label), using a mixture of toluene-ethyl acetate (93:7) as developing solvent. Additionally, essential oils (Aetheroleum Rosae, Aetheroleum Lavandulae, Aetheroleum Citri, Aetheroleum Melissae, Aetheroleum Caryophylli, Aetheroleum Chamomillae) and plant material that naturally contain the target components were used. Performing TLC, visualized with p-anisaldehyde sulfuric acid and seen under UV lamp at 254 nm and 366 nm, in all investigated samples were detected: linalool, geraniol, citral and citronellal. In four samples was detected lemon, in two samples farnesol and isoeugenol, eugenol in one sample, while in three samples was identified coumarin. Conclusion The examples described above show that TLC has the ability to separate mixtures of substances of similar structure as are the perfumes and essential oils. Additionally it is important to mention that using TLC different perfumes were evaluated for their content declared on the labels provided from the manufacturer. Finally this was done with cheap and easy to perform technique.ReferencesKovac-Besovic, E., 2001. Metode u farmakognoziji, Sarajevo-Publishing, Sarajevo.Nigam, M.C., Nigam, I.C., Levi, L., 1965.

Thy-mus species are well known as medical plants that con-tain tannins and flavonoids and are considered as aromat-ic due to their essential oil content. Several studies empha-sized the existence of marked chemical differences among essential oils extracted from different species or varieties. This chemical diversity is generally a function of three fac-tors: genetical and physiological factors as well as the en-vironmental conditions, that can affected the biological ac-tivity of the oils (Mustafa et al., 2012).Production of essential oils by plants is believed to be predominantly a defense mechanism against pathogens and pests as essential oils have been shown to possess an-timicrobial and antifungal properties. Nowadays, essen-tial oils and theirs components are gaining increasing in-terest because of their relatively safe status, their wide ac-ceptance by consumers and their exploitation for potential multi-purpose functional use (Mohammadi et al., 2013).Beside this, the representatives of genus Thymus from Kosovo were poorly investigated in the past thus the aim of this study was essential oil chemical analysis of several wild-growing Thymus species collected from different lo-cations in Kosovo.Material and methodsTotal of 20 samples of eight wild-growing Thymus species were analyzed. The samples of Thymus tosevii (O\u0161ljak and Zaplu\u017ee), Thymus jankae (Zaplu\u017ee), \u0422hymus longicaulis (Belobrod), Thymus pulegioides (Vata), Thy-mus moesiacus (Brezovica and Prevalla), and Thymus to-sevii ssp. substriatus (Gllobo\u00e7ica) were collected from lo-calities in South Kosovo. The samples of Thymus balcanus were collected on Ljumbard Mtn., West Kosovo while the sample of Thymus pannonicus from G\u00ebrmia, East Kosovo.Plant material was harvested in full flowering stage during summer, 2013. The material was put on the paper sheets in a shade and left to air dry. Essential oils were iso-lated by steam distillation in a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 hours. The essential oil composition was analyzed by GC/FID/MS on Agilent 7890\u0410 Gas Chromatography system equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and Agile-nt 5975C Mass Quadripole detector. Operating conditions were as follows: oven temperature 60 \u00b0C (5 min), 1 \u00b0C/min to 80 \u00b0C (2 min) and 5 \u00b0C/min to 280 \u00b0C (5 min); flow rate of 1 mL/min (He); injector T=260 \u00b0C; FID T= 270 \u00b0C; 1 \u00b5L injection volume at split ratio 1:1.The MS was operated in scan mode. Identification of the components present in essential oils was made by com-paring mass spectra of components in essential oils with those from NIST, Wiley and Adams mass spectra libraries, by AMDIS (Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System) and by comparing literature and es-timated Kovat\u2032s (retention) indices that were determined using mixture of homologous series of normal alkanes from C9 to C25 in hexane, under the same above mentioned conditions. The percentage ratio of essential oils compo-nents was computed by the normalization method of the GC/FID peak areas and average values were taken into fur-ther consideration.S5 PP 245514Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 513 - 514 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsResults and discussionWith gas chromatography, 140 compounds were iden-tified in essential oil samples of T. balcanus (South Koso-vo), representing 76.23-98.62% of the oil. Sesquiterpens were found as predominant components, with E-caryoph-yllene (26.96%) as the most abundant compound. One oil sample has showed extremely deferent composition with monoterpene linalool (59.51%) as major constituent. Com-pared with literature, similarities were found with the es-sential oil isolated from T. balcanus from R. Macedo-nia, which contains E-caryophyllene (22.42%), \u03b2-pinene (12.48%) and \u03b1-pinene (5.64%) as main constituents (Ku-levanova et al., 1998).On the other hand, 78 compounds were identified in the essential oil samples of T. jankae (South Kosovo), rep-resenting 97.62% of the total oil. Monoterpenes were iden-tified as main compounds (83.27%) with linalool acetate (19.89%), carvacrol (13.84%) and linalool (10.33%) as predominat constituents. Large amounts of linalool (28.1-35.5%) were also found in essential oils of the Macedo-nian T. jankae (Baba mountain) (Kulevanova et al., 1998).Oxygenated monoterpens (75.01%) were dominated fraction in the essential oil of T. longicaulis. As main com-pounds were detected alcohols linalool (37.69%) and ge-raniol (17.73%) followed by other monoterpenes such as: \u03b2-myrcene (5.87%), terpinen-4-ol (4.79%) and cis-sabi-nene hydrate (4.18%). The chemical profile of two samples of T. moesia-cus (Brezovica and Prvale) was characterised with gerani-ol (13.82% and 13.12%, respectively) and linalool (6.86% and 10.61%, respectively). The phenolic compound thy-mol was determined in higher percent (13.97-19.02%) in the oil sample from Brezovica whereas carvacrol (22.33%) was dominated in the sample from Prevale. These four compounds represented 52.32-53.47% of total oils.Sesquiterpens were predominant in the essential oil of T. pannonicus (72.25%) with germacrene D (17.98%) as main constituent. Larger amount of germacrene D (12.12%) was found in the oil samples of T. pannonicus from Romania, but the most abundant component in this oil was \u03b1-terpinyl acetate (48.83%) (Boz et al., 2011).47 compounds were identified in one essential oil sam-ple from T. pulegioides from Vata (South Kosovo), repre-senting 99.29% of the oil. The oxygenated monoterpenes thymol (33.48%) and geraniol (23.36%) were the main constituents. Large amounts of \u03b3-terpinene (10.49%) were also found. These three constituents represented 67.33% of the total oil. The quantitative variability of linalool (2.23-30.79%) was also noticed in three samples of T. tosevii followed by different percentages of thymol (1.23-5.41%) and carvacrol (2.29-40.34%), as well as linalool acetate (0.48-22.33%). Variability in the essential oil composition of T. tosevii was previously reported by Kulevanova et al. (1996) for the samples from Macedonia. The content of some important constituents of the oil varied in broad ranges such as 7.88-20.92%, 0.24-21.79%, 0.58-30.08% and 0.05-26.87% for linalool, geraniol, thymol and carvacrol, respectively (Ku-levanova et al., 1996).The alcohol linalool (30.78%) was determine as main constituent in the oil of Thymus tosevii ssp. substriatus fol-lowed by high quantities of linalool acetate (21.77%) and thymol (13.21%).ConclusionChemical composition of essential oils of eight Thy-mus species from Kosovo had showed great variability. As the essential oils of Thymus are valuable because of some monoterpene phenols and alcohols (thymol, linalool, gera-niol), the most of the species (T. pulegioides, T. tosevii, T. tosevii ssp. substriatus, T. moesiacus, T. jankae and T. lon-gicaulis) from Kosovo represent biological source of es-sential oil that could be use for exploitation and further uti-lization. On the other hand T. balcanus and T. pannonicus can be exploited for isolation of the sesquiterpene com-pounds, germacrene D and E-caryophyllene, which were predominant constituents in the oils of these species.

Cyril and Methodius University,  Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* gorde.gestakovska@gmail.comIntroductionNowadays, the use of cannabis and its legalization for medical use has become a worldwide trend, due to his significant pharmacological effects. Due to the legal con-straints on the possession and use of C. sativa, relatively little research on the medicinal qualities of this plant has been conducted. Ben Amar (2006) has recently shown that, the therapeutic applications of cannabis and its derivatives have been studied by various world bodies, including the Scientific Committee of the House of Lords in Great Brit-ain, the Institute of Medicine in the United States and the Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs in Canada. Since there is a lack of valuable and reliable information about the routes of cannabis administration and dosage, in this review, we have done overview of six different ways of medical cannabis administration, their risks and benefits. SmokingSmoking cannabis produces the most immediate relief and permits the most refined control of the dosage. When cannabis is smoked, the active ingredients are deposited di-rectly into the blood stream, after being absorbed through the mucus membrane of the lung. Whereas the central ner-vous system and physiological effects occur within min-utes by the smoking route or by vaporization, these effects proceed on a time scale of hours in the case of oral inges-tion. Determining correct dosage is easier with smoked can-nabis, since the effects are usually felt within 30-60 sec. and develop fully within 5-15 min. The effects may last from 30 min. to 3 h. Using natural-based chemical free rolling papers, such as those derived from hemp or rice is recommended for health reasons and to avoid using tree products. Although medical marijuana is nontoxic, smoking it can be hazard-ous over the long term, because toxic compounds are cre-ated in the combustion process. The World Health Organi-zation (WHO) suggests that a typical marijuana cigarette (joint) contains between 0.5 g and 1.0 g of cannabis (av-erage 0.75 g). Commercially available strains of cannabis can contain up to 30% THC. An average joint of a 10% THC cannabis strain would contain 75 mg of THC (0.75 g x 10% THC content).Vaporizing Vaporizers can be used as a smokeless alternative. Cannabis vaporizers are designed to let users inhale ac-tive cannabinoids while avoiding smoke. Vaporizers work by heating the cannabis just below the point of combus-tion, the point at which smoke is produced. When the can-nabis is properly heated, THC and other cannabinoids are emitted in the form of a vapor. This markedly reduces the amount of irritating particulate materials that get inhaled, resulting in much less inflammation and damage to the lin-ing of the lungs. Many patients who find smoked cannabis highly irritating, report effective relief inhaling through va-porizers. Dose is through self titration (gradually adjusting the dose of medicine, until the desired effect is achieved).Using vaporizers, typically between 50 mg and 500 mg of dried marijuana is used at once. Using a 10% THC strain would mean that between 5 mg and 50 mg of THC would be contained in this dose.Sublingual deliveryThe sublingual (under the tongue) or oro-mucosal (in the oral cavity) delivery method of an oil or tincture pro-S5 PP 246516Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 515 - 516 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsvides another rapid onset of action as the medication is readily absorbed into the blood system. Tinctures are usual-ly prepared in a base of alcohol, oil or glycerol. Many con-centrated tinctures are taken by dropper under the tongue, and within a few minutes the patient will feel the effects. Ef-fects of tinctures are usually felt within 5 min. up to 1 h and last about 4 h. It is recommended to start with about 3 drops of tincture, and wait an hour before increasing the dosage incrementally and as necessary. Other tinctures may be in a spray container and sprayed in the mouth to be absorbed in the oral cavity and thence into the bloodstream. The sub-lingual spray is a compromise between the inhaled and oral routes: compared to the oral administration, it reduces the first-pass metabolism, thus increasing the bioavailability of the drug and allowing a greater dose-titration.Oral ingestionOral administration results in a slower onset of action, lower peak blood levels of cannabinoids and a longer du-ration of pharmacodynamic effects, compared to smoking. Taking cannabis by mouth in pill form or swallowed as a liquid, have both benefits and drawbacks. Since the canna-binoids are fat-soluble, their absorption through the gut is slower and less predictable, being dependent upon the indi-vidual\u2019s metabolism as well as the contents of the stomach. The onset of action may take as long as 30 min. to an hour, making it more difficult to determine an effective dose, especially for the novice patient. In addition, when taken orally, the medication gets metabolized through the liver before getting into the bloodstream. The liver converts the THC to another chemical, called 11-hydroxy-THC which is more psychoactive than THC, and so the effects will be different than if inhaled or taken sublingually. The advan-tage of the oral route is that it will last much longer, so a patient does not have to medicate as frequently. This can be helpful for glaucoma patients who are trying to maintain a lower intraocular pressure (Mathre, 2015).Topical applicationCannabis can be applied externally as a topical oint-ment, lotion, or poultice, and may be used in the treatment of skin inflammations, arthritis or muscle pains. The goal is for the medication to be absorbed at the specific location being treated. Although it is unclear how well the cannabi-noids are absorbed through the skin, the more soluble ter-penoids and flavonoids also have anti-inflammatory prop-erties that can be effective.Rectal administrationRectal administration of marijuana has many advan-tages. In addition to be a viable option for patients who can\u2019t ingest or inhale cannabis, cannabis suppositories are the best choice. Cannabis suppositories are made either cannabis-infused coconut oil or cocoa butter infused with FECO oil (full infused cannabis oil). Avoiding the gastro-intestinal tract, prevents metabolism by the stomach and liver, which breaks down the many different cannabinoids into their constituent parts (including THC), and allows the active constituents to reach the blood in much higher con-centrations.50% of THC is usually transformed into its more psychoactive form, 11-Hydroxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocan-nabinol, when taken orally. Rectal administration avoids these effects, whilst allowing a higher proportion of THC to reach the bloodstream. While \u03949-THC itself is not ab-sorbed through the rectal route, the pro-drug \u03949-THC-hemisuccinate is absorbed; this fact, combined with de-creased first-pass metabolism through the rectal route, re-sults in a higher bioavailability of \u03949-THC by the rectal route (52-61%) than by the oral route. In humans, rec-tal doses of 2.5-5.0 mg of the hemisuccinate ester of \u03949-THC were associated with peak plasma levels of \u03949-THC ranging between 1.1 and 4.1 ng/mL within 2-8 h, and peak plasma levels of carboxy-\u03949-THC ranging between 6.1-42.0 ng/mL within 1-8 h after administration (Abramov-ici, 2013).ConclusionIt is important to remember that in addition to dif-ferences in the amount of cannabis used with the various routes of administration, each on is different with respect to the percentage of THC/ other cannabinoids that it deliv-ers to the system and the timing of that delivery. For each pathology, it remains to be determined what type of canna-binoid and what route of administration are the most suit-able to maximize the beneficial effects of each preparation and minimize the incidence of undesirable reactions. To maximize the benefits (efficacy) and reduce the undesir-able effects (toxicity), new formulations for administering and delivering cannabinoids are currently under investiga-tion.ReferencesAbramovici, H., 2013.

Close collaboration with physicians, nurses and oth-er healthcare providers in interdisciplinary teams is vital.Many studies have evaluated the role of a clinical pharmacist and the impact of clinical pharmacy services in different patient groups in both outpatient environments (community pharmacies and ambulatory clinics) and in-patient facilities (teaching hospitals and nursing homes), (Anderson and Schumock, 2009; Gallagher et al., 2014; Rotta et al., 2015) and in various specialty settings (e.g. emergency department) (Davis et al., 2016; Lada and Del-gado, 2007). Clinical pharmacy interventions \u2013 clinical and economic benefitsOne of the main activities of clinical pharmacists are clinical interventions and they are described in several ways (Alderman and Farmer, 2001; Kjeldsen et al., 2014; Westerlund and Marklund, 2009). Most literature reviews conclude that clinical pharmacy interventions contribute to improve patient outcomes and cost savings focusing on specific clinical benefits (e.g. reduced adverse drug ef-fects and medication errors, enhanced medication adher-ence, appropriate use of medications and prescriptions) and economic benefits (e.g. cost-effectiveness) (Anderson and Schumock, 2009; Gallagher et al., 2014; Touchette et al., 2014). However, studies differ regarding their method-ology and outcomes measures, and the description of phar-macist interventions and their implementation are incon-sistent (De Rijdt, 2008; Rotta et al., 2015).Pharmacy students - clinical contributionsAcademia shapes the culture of clinical pharmacy by training future professionals, e.g. in experiential practice rotations (Rathbun et al., 2012). Previous studies examin-ing pharmacy students\u2019 interventions in a variety of prac-tice settings have documented their clinical and econom-ic benefits; however, there are differences regarding study scope, design, and level of detail (Divall et al., 2010; Mers-felder and Bouthillier, 2012; Shepler, 2014; Shogbon and Lundquist, 2014; Woolley et al., 2013). Although studies quantify and categorize student interventions, few provide specific details or discuss trends and the impact of clinical pharmacy preceptors on pharmacy students\u2019 clinical con-tributions (Divall et al., 2010; Mersfelder and Bouthilli-er, 2012; Woolley et al., 2013).Clinical preceptor - impact on pharmacy student interventionsThis presentation focuses on the daily practice of a clinical pharmacy preceptor and academician in a large teaching institution in educating future pharmacists to pro-vide clinical pharmacy services, specifically through iden-tifying and communicating pharmacotherapeutic interven-tions and consults and documenting their outcomes. It includes the results of a recent study assessing the quantity, characteristics, and acceptance rate of 1172 inter-ventions performed by 30 pharmacy students at an inpa-tient institution under the guidance of this preceptor (Tal-bot et al., 2015).S6 OP 247* dorothea.rudolf@mephs.edu520Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 519 - 520 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesStudy methodsDuring their mandatory 6-week inpatient advanced practice experiential rotations, pharmacy students accom-panied medical teams on daily rounds, seeing patients on one of three general medicine floors. Under the direct su-pervision of the same preceptor, the students suggested drug therapy-related interventions, modifications of phar-macotherapy to enhance patient care and safety. Students documented their interventions in a detailed log, including date, brief summary of the clinical situation, description of suggested intervention with evidence-based justification, and medical team\u2019s acceptance or rejection.  Each inter-vention was reviewed for appropriateness by the preceptor. Intervention data was categorized by acceptance/rejection, stratified into specific intervention types, and qualified by therapeutic classes and specific medications involved. De-scriptive statistics were used in the analysis.  Study resultsThe mean number of interventions/student/rotation was 39 (range: 8-83). Overall, the medical team accept-ed 84% of suggested interventions; 4% were partially ac-cepted. Most common intervention types were: adjusting dose/frequency/duration to match indication (17%), initi-ating indicated medication (12%), renally adjusting dose/frequency/duration (10%), changing administration sched-ules to prevent interactions (6%), and discontinuing non-indicated medications (6%). Therapeutic classes most fre-quently involved were: antibiotics (24%), gastrointestinal agents (22%), cardiovascular drugs (13%), supplements (10%), and CNS medications (9%). Overall, 214 unique medications were associated with interventions, most com-monly omeprazole (12%), vancomycin (7%), warfarin (3%), ciprofloxacin (3%), and cefepime (2.3%). Students\u2019 weekly intervention rate increased as rotations progressed. Study conclusionIt was concluded that the high number of clinical inter-ventions cataloged by this study emphasizes the significant impact that Pharmacy students can have on educating pro-viders and enhancing patient care.  The increasing weekly intervention suggestion rate is likely related to students de-veloping familiarity with the medical team, gaining aware-ness of therapeutic problems, and building confidence in initiating and substantiating interventions. The high accep-tance rate may be indicative of the medical teams\u2019 past pos-itive experiences with the students\u2019 valuable clinical phar-macy contributions. The quality of these beneficial inter-ventions was likely augmented by consistent preceptorship. ReferencesACCP (American College of Clinical Pharmacy), 2008. The definition of clinical pharmacy.

Its main mission is to move the focus of attention from the drug to the single patient or population receiving drugs.Clinical pharmacists in Slovenia are following the overall goal of clinical pharmacy activities, i.e., to promote the correct and appropriate use of medicinal products and devices. These activities aim to:\u2022 maximize the clinical effect of medicines, i.e., us-ing the most effective treatment for each individual patient,\u2022 minimize the risk of treatment-induced adverse events, i.e., monitoring the therapy course and the patient\u2019s compliance with therapy, and\u2022 minimize the expenditures for drug treatments, i.e., trying to provide the best treatment alternative accompa-nied by the cost-effective use of drugs for the greatest num-ber of patients.The aim of this contribution is to present recent achievements and perspectives of clinical pharmacy in Slovenia in terms of professional, educational and research activities.MethodsClinical pharmacists in Slovenia have carried into ef-fect all well established methodological approches to im-plement clinical pharmacy activities at primary, secondary and tertiary level of the healthcare system. The term \u201cclini-cal\u201d describes the type of activities which are related to the health of the patient(s) in general and as such does not nec-essarily imply an activity implemented only in a hospital setting but also in the community care. ResultsProfessional activities at primary levelThere are two types of services that are devoloping currently in community care: first, offering medication re-view in community pharmacies and second, establishing the practice of pharmacist-consultant on ambulatory (out-patient) basis in community health centres and in nurs-ing homes. Medication review, performed in community pharmacies, evaluates patient\u2019s medicines with the aim of managing the risk and optimizing the outcome of medi-cine therapy by detecting, solving and preventing drug-re-lated problems. It helps patients use their medicine more effectively by improving knowledge, concordance and use of medicines.  It is offered as Medication use review which includes medication history and patient information, and Advanced medication review which is based on med-ication history, patient information and clinical informa-tion. Clinical information is obtained from patient\u2019s medi-cal records and direct contact between dispensing pharma-cist and attending physician. Medication use review is per-formed by pharmacist with competences, while Advanced medication review should be carried out only by specialist clinical or community pharmacist with appropriate com-petences. The practice of pharmacist-consultant, performed on ambulatory (outpatient) basis has been introduced at the end of 2012 as a project run by Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia. The main purpose of the project is to bring to-gether general practitioners and pharmacists to work close-ly in order to ensure proper use of drugs in clinical prac-tice. Multistep procedure is started by general practitio-ner who identifies either patients with potential drug ad-verse reactions or patients with potential drug-drug inter-S6 OP 248522Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 521 - 522 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencesactions in the case of polypharmacotherapy. These patients and their medical records are referred to the pharmacist who works on the basis of Advanced medication review. The pharmacist\u2019s report is sent back to the general practi-tioner who optimizes the pharmacotherapy in accordance with the patients. The acceptance rate of pharmacist\u2019s pro-posals is approximately 70%. As the 3 year project clearly showed significant decline of drug-related problems, Min-istry of Health of Slovenia has decided in 2016 to intro-duce the practice of pharmacist-consultant in the regular health program financed by the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia.Professional activities at secondary and tertiary levelA full scale model of clinical pharmacy activities in Slovenian hospitals has been introduced in 2007. They are performed in the wards at the patients\u2019 bedside and in the hospital management system. Clinical pharmacists partic-ipate in medical rounds, perform Advanced medication re-views, implement medication reconciliation process, per-form therapeutic drug monitoring activities and prepare drug formularies. Additionally, they participate in hospital committees for drugs, antibiotics and hospital infections, take an active role in creating pharmacotherapeutic guide-lines and start setting up clinical pharmacy departments.Three cases of good clinical pharmacy practice in Slo-venian hospitals are presented. Clinical pharmacists in General hospital Murska Sobota participate at healthcare meetings and ward rounds, they run medication reconcil-iation at hospital admissions and discharges and perform Advanced medication reviews in appointed patients. Clin-ical pharmacists at the University clinic Golnic are inte-grated in the treatment of patients at higher risks for ad-verse drug reactions (those with decreased renal function, prescribed with strong inhibitors or inducers of drug en-zymes and drug transporters, prescribed with strong opi-oids, prescribed with drugs where TDM is performed and prescribed medicines with a feeding tube), oncology pa-tients, patients with tuberculosis and patients with hered-itary angioedema. Additionally, clinical pharmacists suc-cessfully implemented on a full scale a medication recon-ciliation model for all oncological patients admitted to the clinic and introduced TDM service for theopylline (Ru-gelj et al., 2015). Moreover, recently, a randomized, dou-ble-blind, controlled trial on clinical pharmacist\u2019s inter-vention reducing clinically relevant drug-drug interactions in patients with heart failure, was completed at the Uni-versity clinic Golnik and published (Roblek et al., 2016). And finnaly, clinical pharmacists at the University Medi-cal Centre Maribor successfully introduced on a full scale TDM for vankomycin, gentamicin, methyldigoxin and val-proic acid. All patients receiving above-mentioned narrow therapeutic index drugs are entitled to TDM service.Education activitiesSlovene Chamber of Pharmacies runs specialistic courses on clinical pharmacy and community pharmacy. Currently, in Slovenia there are 60 specialists all together, by 2020 additional 90 specialists with competences will be available to perform clinical pharmacy activities in Slove-nian healthcare system.Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana runs PhD course on clinical pharmacy. By 2020 we expect 20 graduates able to design and conduct research activities in the area of clinical pharmacy.Additionally, clinical pharmacists collaborate in under and postgraduate pharmacy courses and courses for physi-cians and nurses,and finnally, clinical pharmacists organize pharmacokinetic courses in the hospital wards for physi-cians and nurses.Research activitiesClinical pharmacists perform clinical studies and run outcomes research in terms of examine closely clinical, hu-manistic and economic outcomes, and publish original and review research articles in peer-reviewed journals.ConclusionClinical pharmacy is implemented successfuly in ma-jority of Slovenian clinics, hospitals, pharmacies and com-munity health centres, it is incorporated in international co-operation on many levels, and finnally, it is on a good way to grow up as an essential part of the Slovenian healthcare system. It is our aim to create a strong team of academ-ic and professional clinical pharmacists with specializa-tions and doctorates in clinical pharmacy, able to run qual-ificative routine clinical practice and advanced clinical re-search, both in favour of the patients.

TDM can be especially beneficial for dose adjustments for drugs with dose-dependent phar-macokinetics, as an aid in the diagnosis of clinical toxicity, for evaluation of drug-drug interactions and drug compli-ance (Milosheska et al., 2015). Clinical pharmacokinetics in practice is applied to TDM for drugs that are characterized by a narrow thera-peutic range and a large variability in pharmacokinetics. Moreover, population modeling is a powerful tool to quan-titatively evaluate the influence of various clinical, bio-chemical, demographic factors and other sources of vari-ability on the dose-concentration relationship. TDM in clinical practice is initiated for a number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) particularly due to the episodic nature of the condition and difficulties to assess the clinical efficacy of AEDs. Initially TDM was employed for the old generation of AEDs such as carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenytoin, and primidone, which are characterized by complex and variable pharmacokinetics. On the other hand, benefit of TDM for the new generation of AEDs including lamotrig-ine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, stiripentol, tiagabine, le-vetiracetam, and zonisamide, is often questioned as they have more favourable pharmacokinetics, wider therapeutic range and better tolerability in terms of interaction and ad-verse effects profile (Patsalos et al., 2008). Therefore, sub-stantial research is needed to better document the value of TDM of the new AEDs in clinical practice. The aim of the present report was to provide evidence of the usage of pop-ulation pharmacokinetic models as extensions of the ther-apeutic drug monitoring in patients with epilepsy treated with lamotrigine (LTG) or oxcarbazepine (OXC). Materials and methodsTwo prospective clinical studies were conducted on patients with confirmed epilepsy on stable OXC or LTG therapy at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slo-venia. Both studies were approved by the National Medi-cal Ethics Committee of the Republic of Slovenia and were carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. At least two blood samples per patient were drawn, approx-imating trough and peak steady-state concentrations. Plas-ma concentrations of OXC and its main metabolite were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spec-trometry method, developed and validated for the study purposes. For LTG plasma concentration measurements an adapted HPLC method with UV detection was used. Pa-tients enrolled in LTG study were genotyped for metabo-lizing enzymes (UGT1A4 and UGT2B7) by real-time PCR genotyping using TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assays on the ABI 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) and for transporters (ABCB1 and SLC22A1) using a fluorescence-based competitive allele-specific (KASPar) assays according to the manufactur-er\u2019s instructions (KBiosciences, Herts, UK). The popula-tion pharmacokinetic analysis was performed employing a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach using NON-MEM software (ver. 7.3, Icon Development Solutions, Ell-icott City, MD, USA.) (Bauer, 2011).Results and discussionA total of 100 pharmacokinetic profiles from adult pa-tients on stable LTG therapy were available for pharma-cokinetic analysis. The structural model used was a one-S6 OP 249524Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 523 - 524 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencescompartment model with first order absorption and elimi-nation. With a base model, absorption rate (inter-individu-al variability) was estimated at 1.96 h-1 (72.8%), oral clear-ance at 2.32 L/h (41.4%) and distribution volume at 77.6 L (30.2%). Residual variability was most adequately de-scribed using a proportional error model and was estimat-ed at 19.8%. LTG clearance was associated with UGT2B7 genetic polymorphism, patient\u2019s weight, renal function, smoking and co-treatment with enzyme inducing or inhib-iting drugs. This study showed that there is a significant variability in LTG pharmacokinetics and therefore TDM can be useful in various clinical settings for therapy indi-vidualization.A total of 84 plasma concentration measurements of OXC and its active metabolite 10-monohydroxyoxcar-bazepine (MHD) from 18 pediatric patients (age 6 months-3years) with epilepsy on stable OXC therapy were includ-ed into the study. The structural model was comprised of two-compartment model for the parent drug and one com-partment model for the disposition of the active metabo-lite. The estimated parameters were absorption rate con-stant (Ka), volume of the central and peripheral compart-ment of the parent drug (V1OXC and V2OXC), elimination and distribution clearance of the parent drug (CLOXC and QOXC), and clearance and distribution volume of the me-tabolite (CLMHD and V1MHD). Estimated parameters (inter-individual variability) of the base model were Ka 0.581 h-1 (90.9%); CLOXC 33.7 L/h (41.4%); V1OXC 21.3 L (152%); V2OXC 3299 L; QOXC 26.4 L; CLMHD 0.128 L/h (26.4%); V1MHD 3.13 L. Model that include allometric scaling of the clearance and distribution volume parameters and matura-tion function on OXC and MHD clearance was adopted as the final model. Developed model provided new insights into the developmental aspects of OXC and MHD disposi-tion in pediatric patients. Future studies are needed to con-firm those findings and to evaluate the developed pharma-cokinetic model as a tool for therapy optimization.ConclusionPerformed clinical studies demonstrated that there is a considerable variability in LTG and OXC pharmacoki-netics and the application of therapeutic drug monitoring can be useful for therapy optimization in patients with ep-ilepsy. Identification and quantification of the sources of variability among patients is essential for individualization of drug therapy, and it can be accomplished by employing population pharmacokinetic approach. Therefore, pharma-cokinetic modeling can serve as valuable extension of ther-apeutic drug monitoring and can be used for therapy opti-mization and individualization in routine clinical practice significantly contributing to more rational pharmacothera-py of antiepileptic drugs.ReferencesBauer, R.J., 2011.

Pharmacogenetics (PGx) aims at identifying genes and genetic variants that affect the clinical outcome of ther-apy, i.e. determination of inherited genetic differences and genetic mechanisms that condition or disposition efficacy and toxicity of drugs (Jones 2013). PGx prediction of the therapeutic outcome in each patient individually, is a chal-lenge and it\u2019s usage in clinical practice is still far from re-ality. The extensive research efforts undertaken over the past decade have identified several genetic markers that are strongly associated with outcomes of interest. Appraising the drug related function of CYP450 (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5 and AKR1D1) genetic variants is the core for efficient modeling of population specific, cost-ef-fective, PGx platform for individualization of drug thera-py (Cabaleiro et al., 2015; Holmes et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2015; Kapedanovska Nestorovska et al., 2014; L\u00f3pez-Ro-dr\u00edguez  et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2014; Rejon-Parrilla et al., 2014) . The objective of this study is to determine the differen-tial expression of polymorphic CYP450 genes and the cor-relation of mRNA levels in the liver and peripheral blood, to evaluate the clinical validity of the CYP450 phenotype in prediction of pharmacokinetic properties and therapeu-tic outcome of substrate drugs (CYP2D6 for risperidone, CYP2C19 for clopidogrel and CYP2C9 for ibuprofen) and to assess cost-effectiveness of PGx platform for individ-ualized treatment with risperidone and clopidogrel in our country. Materials and methodsThe studies included a total of 482 subjects, of which 230 healthy volunteers and 252 patients. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms is determined by using the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction while the rel-ative mRNA level of the CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A5 and AKR1D1 genes, in the liver and peripheral blood, was determined by the method of qRT-PCR. Plas-ma and urinary concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH ris-peridon as well as of ibuprofen in healthy volunteers and patients with psychiatric disorders are determined using a validated HPLC-MS / MS and HPLC.  Decision tree mod-el, including only direct drug related costs was used to evaluate the economic viability of the PGx application in individualization of Rispiridone and Clopidrogel therapy in our country. Results and discussionAccording to the results, the relative CYP450 mRNA levels and the degree of their mutual correlation in liver and peripheral blood indicate tissue specific, sexually di-morphic, cis /trans regulated gene expression and activi-ty. The CYP3A5 gene expression in blood can be used as a biomarker to study the physiological and pathological vari-ations of CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and AKR1D1 en-zymes. Association of CYP450 allele variants with drug pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome, (CYP2D6 for risperidone, CYP2C9 for ibuprofen and CYP2C19 for clopidogrel), confirm the genetic basis of variability in drug response in patients from R. Macedonia. Risperidone metabolic ratio is a useful therapeutic biomarker to rec-ommend CYP2D6 genetic testing to guide the present or future treatment of patients.The PGx defined Risperidone dose strategy (assuming 99% test accuracy) was associ-S6 OP 250526Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 525 - 526 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencesated with \u20ac7.6 /month/patient increase in total treatment cost and health gain of 0,11 QALY, yielding an ICER of \u20ac69.32/ QALY, compared to the traditional approach. Re-duced PGx test accuracy (95% and 50%) augmented the ICER (\u20ac610.73/QALY and \u20ac2300.22/QALY, respectively), due to the \u20ac30.53/ month increase in the treatment for each incorrect genotyped patient. Total accumulated cost per pa-tient for the PGx guided clopidogrel therapy was \u20ac99.049 versus \u20ac 107.62 for the traditional treatment strategy while the mean drug-associated cost was e \u20ac21.09 and \u20ac9.68, re-spectively. The cost associated with and due to side events hospitalization was 1.5-fold less in PGx compared to the traditional treatment. Economic assessment of genetic screening testing for mutations that affect the level of ex-pression and functional activity of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes justifies the application of PGx individualized treat-ment with risperidone and clopidogrel in our country. ConclusionThe established association between the examined ge-netic variations, drug pharmacokinetics, clinically signifi-cant patient outcomes as well as the obtained pharmaco-economic evidence, highlighte the opportunities of imple-menting PGx guided drug treatment in R.

P-gp has been linked with predisposition to psychiatric dis-orders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and depres-sion. The P-gp expression and functional activity plays im-portant role in pharmacotherapy resistance and unpredict-able therapeutic response to antipsychotics (Bruhn et al., 2014). Establishing the association between concentrations of risperidone and its active metabolite 9-OH risperidone in the body (plasma and urine) with the genetic profile of the metabolic and transporter proteins will enable better therapeutic approach and achievement of desired therapeu-tic outcome (Zhu et al., 2007).ObjectiveThe aim of this research is to determine the association of polymorphic variability of ABCB1 gene with the relative mRNA expression of the transport protein in the body, to determine the relationship of P-glycoprotein with the pre-disposition to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as to evaluate the inadequate response and the occurrence of side effects in patients treated with risperidone.Materials and methodsThe total of 222 subjects, of which 124 healthy sub-jects (107 healthy volunteers and 45 postmortem individ-uals) and 54 patients (bipolar disorder and schizophrenia) from Republic of Macedonia were included in the study. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms for the ABCB1 for three polymorphisms C1236T [rs1128503], G2677A/T [rs2032582] and C3435T [rs1045642] were an-alyzed by Real-Time PCR while the relative expression of ABCB1 gene in different tissues (blood, brain, liver, kid-ney, duodenum, jejunum, ileum colon) from the same indi-viduals. Plasma and urinary concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH risperidon in healthy volunteers and patients with psychiatric disorders are determined using a validated HPLC-MS / MS and HPLC.  Results and discussionOur result confirmed the influence of \u0410\u0412\u0421\u04121gene po-limorhosms, gender and age on P-gp mRNA relative ex-pression. Determination of relative expression of ABCB1 gene in different tissues (blood, brain, liver, kidney, duode-num, jejunum, ileum colon) from the same individuals al-lows interpretation of the tissue distribution of the trans-port protein in the body. The homogeneity of the data en-abled building of a predictive model for determining the relative expression of mRNA of the transporter protein in different tissues with an acceptable error (4-11%). The model is based on the obtained results for the influence of C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T polymorphisms and hap-lotypes, gender, age relative expression of ABCB1 in blood and their mutual interactions on the relative mRNA expres-S6 OP 251528Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 527 - 528 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencession of P-glycoprotein (Marzolini et al., 2004).Due to the active role of P-glycoprotein in the trans-port through the blood brain barrier (BBB), ABCB1 has a possible role in the predisposition for occurrence of cen-tral nervous system diseases. The results of this study have confirmed the role of the ABCB1 gene in predisposition to psychiatric disorders and increased risk of developing bipolar disorder in carriers of the heterozygotes and mu-tant homozygotes for polymorphic variations in 1236 and 2677 in comparison to the normal genotype carriers (Ab-bott, 2013).HPL\u0421-UV method for determination of the concentra-tions of risperidone and 9-OH risperidone in plasma and urine, that can be used in clinical practice for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) was optimized and validated (Jo-vanovic et al., 2010).Pharmacogenetic analyzes confirmed the influence of polymorphic variability of the transporter to the pharma-cokinetic properties of risperidone in healthy individuals from the study of bioequivalence and patient population. It gives an opportunity for clinical application of this analy-sis in order to avoid side effects and to improve the thera-peutic activity.Our findings suggest that the allele frequencies in Macedonians are similar to those reported for Caucasians of European descendant and have shown statistically sig-nificant differences in comparison with the Asians and Af-rican population. We have identified eight different haplo-types in our population but, three haplotypes CGC, TTT and CGT represent almost 90% of ethnical Macedonians. This study may contribute to population specific data on ABCB1 gene and has to be taken into account in order to for future establishment of the association and function-al impact of ABCB1 polymorphisms with various drug re-sponses and disease predispositions in R. Macedonia (Nau-movska et al., 2014).This study suggested influence of ABCB1 genetic variation on P-gp activity or expression and predisposition to mood disorders, but not to schizophrenia. One of the fu-tures prospective of our work might be the evaluation of the influences of polymorphic variants in the promoter re-gion on ABCB1 expression and estimation of its influence of predisposition for certain psychiatric disorders. One of the most important limiting factors in the study was the re-stricted number of the patients, but obtained results are in agreement with most of the findings from other relevant studies.ConclusionObtained results confirm the role of pharmacogenetics as a modern tool for rational pharmacotherapy, which is ec-onomically justified.ReferencesAbbott, N.J., 2013.

In the recent years there is a huge improvement in treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, particularly in younger patients with less than 65 years, mainly based on the intro-duction of novel agents, such as bortezomib, thalidomide and lenalidomide. Doubling survival in myeloma patients as compared to the 1990s when only chemotherapy was used is based on introducing of autologous stem cell trans-plantation and novel agents such as bortezomib, thalido-mide and lenalidomide. So the main question is what do we learn nowadays from these improvement?First of all today, we are facing the redefinition the therapeutic goal: \u201ccure\u201cor \u201cdisease control\u201d, that means to convert the disease in a chronic condition which en-ables the patient to survive more than 20 years with a good quality of life. Conventional chemotherapy did not ful-fill these expectations and in the era of conservative ap-proach with conservative chemotherapy younger patients lost 18 years of life, and most of them suffered the emo-tional burden of several relapses until disease become re-fractory. But the mainstay of these is based in the tests that are currently used to define complete remission. It become clear that previous evaluation have not enough strength to predict disease outcome. Low relative sensitivity is land-mark of the criteria that have been recently used to define treatment response such as less than 5% plasma cells in the bone marrow, the disappearance of the M-protein by im-munofixation, and the complete disappearance of any ex-tra-osseus plasmocytoma (Palumbo et al., 2011). Today we have more sensitive tools which are required and enable us to improve the assessment of treatment efficacy in the pa-tients with multiple myeloma.Today, physicians are able to offer wider variety of treatment options for both young and elderly patients with multiple myeloma. Therapeutic options should be tailored and personalized according to patient\u2019s characteristics by balancing efficacy and toxicity of each drug. Effective treatment should be concentrated at the early phase of dis-ease, when clones are more drug sensitive, long \u2013 lasting remission are more frequent, and serious adverse events are less prominent. This approach significantly improves quality of life and may ultimately prolong overall survival (Genadieva Stavric et al., 2014; Moreau et al., 2015).Initial therapy for multiple myeloma depends to a cer-tain extent on patients characteristics such as: eligibility for autologous stem cell transplantation per se; age and co-morbidities. The role of induction therapy is to induce re-mission, but patient\u2019s characteristics have a significant role in the initial treatment approach. Goals of treatment are: to eradicate the tumor clone, including cancer stem cell, to search for an appropriate balance between efficacy and toxicity with three different but complementary aims: qual-ity of life, survival prolongation and eventually the dream of cure. This can be achieved if we use appropriate tools to evaluate treatment efficacy (Rajkumar et al., 2014; Ria et al., 2014). Achieving the lowest level of minimal residual disease can be an important goal of therapy, a step in the path to cure (Bianchi et al., 2015; Paiva et al., 2015).When autologous stem cell transplantation is a thera-peutic option for a newly diagnosed young, fit patient, the patient must be treated with agents that do not compro-mise hematopoetic stem/progenitor cell collection, so af-ter a few cycles of induction therapy progenitor stem cells should be collected. Nowadays initial treatment options for a young newly diagnosed patient with multiple myeloma should be based by a risk adopted approach conforming to the maxim of optimizing the therapeutic index by balanc-ing efficacy with potential side effect (Paiva et al., 2015; Rajkumar et al., 2014; Ria et al., 2014).If an hematologist would search for cured patients with multiple myeloma, he would stop in the registry of trans-planted patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation. Unfortunately there is only a small number of these pa-S6 OP 252530Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 529 - 530 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencestients. The main reasons for that are: high transplant related mortality, donor limitations, advanced age. In the field of autologous transplantation there is operationally \u201ccure\u201d for only 3-10% of multiple myeloma patients which will re-main in complete remission after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. The main advantages of autologous transplantation are: achieving complete re-mission in 15-30%, the possibility of long treatment-free period with excellent quality of life; prolongation of sur-vival by one year. There is still a role of autologous stem cell transplantation in the era of novel agents. With autolo-gous transplantation after induction therapy there is a pos-sibility for further decrease of the tumor mass. Incorporat-ing the novel agents in the induction protocols improved the complete remission rates and this is the first step to-wards higher complete remission rate after transplantation. Today, complete remission is considered as \u201ccondition sine qua non\u201d for an improved survival (Paiva et al., 2015). The efficacy of treatment is mainly related to the achievement of a durable response. We already know that mechanism of action of high-dose melphalan and novel agent are differ-ent, so they are acting complementary. There are at least five active classes of treatment: alkylators, corticosteroids, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and an-tracyclines. All these drugs have significant activity against multiple myeloma when are used alone, but having in mind that they may have complementary mechanism of action, their activity is increased further when they are combined between each-other. So, today we are facing numerous doublet, triplet and quadruplet combinations which have been tested through the use of these drugs. Therapeutic options should be tailored and personal-ized according to patient\u2019s characteristics by balancing ef-ficacy and toxicity of each drug which is especially impor-tant for elderly patients. In the mode of sequencing treat-ment for elderly patients with multiple myeloma, our goal is to achieve and maintain maximal response while limit-ing treatment-related toxicities as much as possible. Sec-ond-generation novel agents, such as carfilzomib, pomalid-omide, elotuzumab, bendamustine are currently being evaluated as an option to improve treatment outcome in myeloma patients (Bianchi et al., 2015).ReferencesBianchi, G.,  Munshi, N.C., 2015.

Husbands1 1Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Bath, BA2 7AY, UK 2Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA3Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, Port St. Lucie, Fl, USA* snezanacupara@yahoo.comIntroductionAlthough mu opioid (MOP) analgesics, such as mor-phine, are the preferred analgesics, they possess well char-acterised, unwanted effects such as respiratory depression and abuse potential.When a NOP (nociceptin receptor) agonist is co-ad-ministered with a MOP agonist, the combination produc-es a synergistic effect, resulting in enhanced analgesia (Ko and Husbands, 2013). This suggests the possibility of ob-taining strong analgesia with only low efficacy partial ago-nism at both MOP and NOP receptors. Buprenorphine pos-sesses partial MOP agonist activity and, importantly, low efficacy, modest potency NOP partial agonism. Howev-er, one study has detected no NOP receptor involvement in buprenorphine-induced physiological responses in pri-mates (Cremeans et al., 2012) and so an improved anal-gesic might have a buprenorphine-like profile but with en-hanced NOP activity. Structure-activity relationship stud-ies suggested that the region of space occupied by the tert-butyl group in buprenorphine was key to good NOP recep-tor activity (Cami-Kobeci et al., 2011a, 2011b; Khroyan et al., 2011).To this end we have synthesized novel buprenorphine-like analogs with increased NOP affinity and efficacy. Materials and methodsAccess to analogues of buprenorphine in which the t-butyl group is replaced by alternative bulky groups was by the standard procedure of Grignard addition to ketone.Binding affinities of the new compounds, plus various standards, were determined in CHO cells transfected with human receptor cDNA, as previously described (Spagno-lo et al., 2008); the displaced selective radioligands were [3H]DAMGO, [3H]Cl-DPDPE, [3H]U69593 and [3H]N/OFQ for binding to MOP, delta opioid (DOP), kappa opi-oid (KOP) and NOP receptors respectively.  The ligands were assessed for functional activity in the [35S]GTP\u03b3S-binding assay in human receptor transfected CHO cells (Spagnolo et al., 2008).BU08028 has been evaluated in vivo for attenuation of acute pain, using the tail flick assay and these results will be presented. To characterize the pharmacological profile of BU08028 as an analgesic in rhesus monkeys, acute ther-mal nociception and capsaicin-induced thermal allodynia assays were conducted.Results and discussionOf the analogues of buprenorphine with variation in the C20 substituents BU08028 having t-pentylgroup,has a Ki of less than 10 nM at each receptor in the opioid recep-tor family, making it the first universally high affinity opi-oid ligand.  More importantly, even though the structure is very similar to that of buprenorphine, its affinity at NOP re-ceptor is almost 10 fold higher than that of buprenorphine itself.In vitro functional activity, as determined by [35S]GTP\u03b3S binding, indicated that BU08028 has virtually no efficacy at delta and kappa receptors.  At mu receptors, the functional activity is very similar to buprenorphine, with only 21% stimulation relative to DAMGO. At NOP recep-tors, the EC50 is 43.5 nM, approximately 6 times more po-tent than buprenorphine, and has significantly higher ef-S6 OP 253532Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 531 - 532 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencesficacy showing but it is far more efficacious, having 44% stimulationrelative to N/OFQ, ascompared to buprenor-phine which has stimulation in the range of 15%.In the tail flick assay BU08028produced a dose-dependent increase in antinociception through MOP receptor activation.Systemic administration of BU08028 (0.001-0.01 mg/kg) in rhesus monkeys, dose-dependently produced antino-ciception against acute thermal nociception and capsaicin-induced thermal allodynia. Compared to buprenorphine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), the antinociceptive effect of BU08028 was more potent and much longer-lasting (i.e., more than 24 hours). BU08028-induced antinociception was attenu-ated equally by both mu opioid (MOP) receptor antagonist naltrexone (0.03 mg/kg) and NOP antagonist J-113397 (0.1 mg/kg), indicating that BU08028 is a bifunctional MOP/NOP agonist in primates. When administered alone in dos-es up to 0.01 mg/kg, BU08028 did not induce itch scratch-ing, a standard side-effect of opioids such as buprenor-phine.More importantly, BU08028 at antinociceptive dos-es did not compromise physiological functions including respiration and cardiovascular activities measured by the radio-telemetric probes. Compared to MOP agonists, bu-prenorphine and remifentanil, BU08028 did not produce reinforcing effects in monkeys under the progressive-ratio schedule of drug self-administration.ConclusionWe have discovered BU08028, and other compounds, having binding affinity at MOP receptors similar to that of buprenorphine and, as desired, higher affinity and consid-erably higher efficacy than buprenorphine at NOP recep-tors.  In measures of hyperalgesia, both in rodents (rats) and non-human primates (rhesus monkey) BU08028was a potent, long-acting anti-hyperalgesic with both MOP and NOP components to its activityin the absence of common side effects associated with MOP agonists in primates.This study strongly supports the therapeutic potential of ligands with mixed MOP/NOP actions as innovative analgesics in humans.BU08028 therefore represents a potential analge-sic agent, with low side effect profile.This work was supported by NIDA grants DA020469 (SMH), DOD/Army W81XWH-13-2-0045, US-PHS grants DA-035359 and DA-032568 (M-ChKo) and DA023281 (LToll).ReferencesCami-Kobeci, G., Polgar, W.

The core com-petences of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis are medicinal chemistry and innovative drug discovery with outstanding expertise in molecular modelling, organic syn-thesis, medicinal chemistry and preclinical drug develop-ment for the treatment of infections, cancer, cardiovascu-lar diseases, and neuronal disorders. During the last decade several new drug candidate molecules have been discov-ered in the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis. From meldonium to new cardioprotective drug methyl-GBB Meldonium (mildronate; 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazini-um) propionate) is a clinically used cardiometabolic drug. The mechanism of action of the drug includes lowering the L-carnitine and its metabolite contents in body tissues through inhibition of enzyme \u03b3-butyrobetaine hydroxy-lase and organic cation/carnitine transporter type 2 protein (Dambrova et al, 2002; Dambrova et al., 2016). After investigation of molecular mechanisms of mel-donium, we started screening program which resulted in the discovery of a novel compound, 4-[ethyl(dimethyl)am-monio]butanoate (methyl-GBB) (Tars et al., 2014). Meth-yl-GBB treatment decreased the acylcarnitine contents and lead to cardioprotective effects by limiting long-chain fatty acid oxidation and facilitating glucose metabolism. In vivo pretreatment with methyl-GBB attenuated the infarct size and significantly improved 24 h survival of rats (Liepinsh et al., 2015). In apolipoprotein E knockout mice, methyl-GBB treatment reduced the size of atherosclerotic plaques (Vilskersts et al., 2015). In the experimental models of di-abetes methyl-GBB administration improved insulin sen-sitivity and reduced blood glucose levels (Liepinsh et al, 2016). These results provide evidence that the pharmaco-logical decreasing of the acylcarnitine content may repre-sent a novel treatment strategy for cardiovascular diseases.ConclusionThe Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis hosts the innovative synergy of academic achievements in organic chemistry and pharmacology with competent applied re-search in medicinal chemistry to drive smart drug discov-ery projects.Acknowledgements Supported by the Latvian State Research Program BIOMEDICINE.

The high degree of conservation of these enzymes among prokaryotes and eukaryotes indicates an essential role in cell biology. Because its structure is a dou-ble helix, DNA is under tortional stress that results in mul-tiplex twisting of the molecule. To be processed for repli-cation or gene expression, the supercoiled DNA must be-come accessible to nucleic acid polymerases or compo-nents of the transcription machinery. This change requires relaxation and untangling of the intertwined DNA strands, which are the typical tasks of Topo (Hande, 2003). In humans, two classes of Topo are well characterized, type I and type II. Topo type II (Topo II) are useful as drug target, since they have an indispensable function in cell bi-ology and they lack biological redundancy. Inhibitors of these enzymes have become central parts of both prima-ry and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in neoplastic dis-eases, and they probably will remain so for the foresee-able future.Classical Topo II inhibiting agents such as epipodo-phyllotoxins or anthracyclines interfere with the break-age-reunion reaction of Topo II by stabilizing this cleav-able complex. The stabilization of the cleavable complex and not the inhibition of the Topo II activity is supposed to play the decisive role in the cytotoxic effect of the classical Topo II interacting agents. Accordingly, resistance against classical Topo II-inhibiting agents can result from any pro-cess that leads to an altered binding of Topo II to drugs or DNA and a reduced formation of cleavable complexes. In-deed, it was demonstrated that decreased Topo II catalytic activity can mediate drug resistance to cancer cells (Beck et al., 2001). Because of Topo II is the target for some of the most active anticancer drugs such as etoposide, teniposide, and doxorubicin used in the treatment of human malignancies, detailed investigations of bi- and ter-benzimidazole deriva-tives revealed that these compounds constitute a new class of Topo I and II inhibitors. Work on such compounds indi-cates that a fused ring system in the structure is critical for the activity.In the past years, we synthesized several derivatives of benzazoles, such as benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles, ben-zothiazoles, and oxazolo(4,5-b)pyridines as isosteric fused heterocyclic compounds to investigate their eukaryotic DNA Topo II inhibitory activity (Pinar et al. 2004) and re-alized their three dimentional quantitative structure activi-ty relationships (3D-QSAR) analysis by using comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (COMSIA) method (Tekiner-Gulbas et al., 2006).A training set of 37 compounds of benzazoles, which are possessing benzoxazole, benzimidazole, benzothia-zole, and oxazolo(4,5-b)pyridine fused heterocylic nucle-us at their structure, were tested for their eukaryotic DNA Topo II inhibitor activity in cell-free system by using relax-ation assay. The relaxation assay utilises supercoiled plas-mid as substrate and has been used by many investigators to study the catalytic activity of Topo I and II types. In-hibitory activities were presented as micromolar concen-trations of the compounds that cause 50% inhibition per unit of enzyme (IC50), under the assay conditions. From the plots obtained with three different concentrations of the drugs, IC50 values were obtained and the results are the averages of two to three estimations. If no inhibition was obtained at 100 \u00b5M, the drug was assumed to have no in-hibitory activity on eukaryotic DNA Topo II (Pinar et al., 2004).For the 3D-QSAR studies performed by using CoM-SIA methods running the SYBYL program package with S6 OP 255536Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 535 - 536 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencesthe IRIX 6.5 operating system of a training set of benzox-azole, benzimidazole, and oxazolo(4,5-b)pyridine deriva-tives, which were their eukaryotic Topo II inhibitory activ-ities observed in cell-free system by using relaxation assay, to assume the predictions for their structure activity rela-tionships (Tekiner-Gulbas et al., 2006).From among the training set of 37 compounds, 28 ben-zazole derivatives were found to be able to inhibit the eu-karyotic DNA Topo II in cell-free system at an initial con-centration of 100 \u00b5g/ml. These 28 compounds were fur-ther tested at a lower range of concentrations to define their inhibitory activity and etoposide was used as the stan-dard drug in order to compare their activity. Of these 28 compounds, 12 derivatives had IC50 values between 11.4 and 46.8 \u00b5M range and they were considered as positive Topo II inhibitors. Among these compounds, 2-phenoxy-methylbenzothiazole, 6-nitro- 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)ben-zoxazole, 5-methylcarboxylate-2-phenylthiomethylbenz-imidazole, and 6-methyl-2-(2-nitrophenyl)-benzoxazole were found as more active than the reference drug etopo-side. Moreover, 5-nitro-2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)benzoxazole, 5-(4-fluorophenyl-carboxyamide)-2-phenylbenzoxazole), 5-methyl-2-phenylthiomethylbenzimidazole, and 5-nitro-2-phenoxymethylbenzimidazole had Topo II inhibitory ac-tivities comparable to etoposide. The results indicate that either having sterically bulky substituents such as phenylacetamide or phenoxyacet-amide groups at position 5 or holding a non-aromatic moi-ety as cyclohexyl or cyclopentyl rings and/or a pyridine ring at position 2 of the fused heterocyclic nucleus causes a severely reduced or lack of activity. On the other hand, different fused heterocyclic nuclei in the structures of the most potent Topo II inhibitors are indicating bioisosteric properties for the enzyme inhibitory activity (Pinar et al., 2004).For the 3D-QSAR studies, the best performed CoM-SIA model was obtained from the combination of two fields (i.e., steric and hydrophobic). The LOO cross-vali-dated PLS analysis of the best model gave rise to a cross-validated value (q2) of 0.562, suggesting that the model is a useful tool for predicting Topo II inhibitory activity. The correlation coefficient between the calculated and ex-perimental activities non crossvalidated value (r2) of 0.968 with standard error 0.073 indicates that the fitness of ana-lyzed results is 96.8% compared to experimental results. The respective relative contributions of steric and hydro-phobic fields are 35% and 65%, indicating that hydropho-bic field is more predominant. The established model was validated using a test set of compounds, which were not in-cluded in the development of the model (Tekiner-Gulbas et al., 2006). There are two significant contours representing the fa-vored steric area to increase the inhibition against the Topo II enzyme. If a bulky substituent, such as methoxy group, is attached on ortho position of 2-phenyl-5-nitro-benzox-azole, it will occupy into favorable for steric contour and will enhance the activity. According to the 5-methylcar-boxylate-2-phenylthiomethylbenzimidazole, both meta and para positions of the phenyl group, which are attached to the 2nd position of benzimidazole ring system, fit into the favorable for steric contour and improve the activity. In CoMSIA study, hydrophobic similarity index fields are also constructed and an area found, which is placed on phenyl ring of the most active compound 5-methylcarbox-ylate-2-phenylthiomethylbenzimidazole, means favorable for hydrophobic. The phenyl group of another the most ac-tive compound 2-phenyl-5-nitro-benzoxazole also fits into the same favorable area. On the other side, nitro group of 2-phenyl-5-nitro-benzoxazole and carbonyl group of ester moiety of 5-methylcarboxylate-2-phenylthiomethylbenz-imidazole play a very important role for increasing Topo II inhibitory activity. We could say that hydrophilic area is more significant than hydrophobic area to enhance the ac-tivity. Because all phenyl rings attached at the 2nd position of benzazole ring system fit into one of the favorable hy-drophobic contours.In conclusion, the results point out that benzimidazole, benzoxazole, benzothiazole, and/or oxazolopyridine de-rivatives also exhibit significant Topo II inhibitory activ-ity and may provide advanced opportunities to design and develop new chemotherapeutic agents.Furthermore, the observed COMSIA contour plots provide many useful in-sights into relationships between structural features and in-hibitory activity for these benzazole derivatives.ReferencesBeck, W.T., Mo, Y.Y., Bhat, U.G., 2001.

Borsari, 46 Ferrara, Italy* emilija.janevik@ugd.edu.mkIntroduction Our work was focused on the investigation for a ready to use prepared freeze dried rituximab immunoconjugates as potential radiopharmaceuticals for labeling with Lu-177 and Y-90 in order to increase the stability and higher efficiency and lower toxicity. We tested three bifunctional chelating agents (BFCA\u2019s), p-SCN-Bn-DOTA, p-SCN-Bn-DTPA and 1B4M-DTPA conjugated to the same antibody using previously established protocol for conjugation (Gjorgieva Ackova, 2014, 2015; Smilkov, 2014).The main goal was to investigate chemical character-ization of the immunoconjugates, labeled with \u201ccold\u201d non-radioactive isotopes of Lutetium and Yttrium in the same conditions as with radioactive Lutetium 177 and to show the chemical behavior and toxicological properties.Material and methodThe conjugation of antibody with three different bifunc-tional cleating agents was performed using using previous-ly established protocol for conjugation. The concentrations were adjusted to 1 mg/mL and the solutions were then ly-ophilized. The purified immunoconjugates were formulated in ab-sence of any cryoprotectant at the concentration of 10 mg/mL, and subsequently lyophilized according to selected pro-tocols.The process of freeze drying was completed using Lab-conco Free Zone Stoppering Tray Dryer, (USA), using pro-tocol described by Park in 2013, modified to our experience.Concentration of the antibody/immunoconjugate was determinate before and after freeze drying and reconstitu-tion using UV spectrophotometer (Jenway UV/VIS spectro-photometer 6715), and semi-micro UV polypropylene tubes with 0.1M PBS pH=8.0, at 280 nm in triplicate. After freeze drying both characterization of the conju-gates and determination of the average number of BFCA at-tached to each antibody molecule is performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and integrity of the antibody was evaluated using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, on 12% bis-tris acrylamide gel. The spectroscopic characterization of all three freeze dried immunoconjugates, in terms of monitoring the sec-ondary protein structure (and its preservation), was achieved S6 OP 256538Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 537 - 538 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencesby FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy.The freeze dying immunoconjugates after reconsti-tution were labeling with Lu-177 (555 MBq/mg in 0,5 M NH4OAc) and radiochemical purity was determined by in-stant thin-layer chromatography on silica plates with a mo-bile phase of ammonium acetate : methanol (1 : 1) using Cy-clone Plus Phosphore Imager (Perkin Elmer). The obtained radioimmunoconjugates were characterized by SE-HPLC, using a Zorbax Bio Series GF-250 column and the elution process was monitored on UV detector at 280 nm and radiodetector (Wojdowska, 2014).Toxicological studies were performed in Wistar rats af-ter injection of rituximab labeled with cold Lutetium and Yttrium. Biodistribution studies were performed in 5-6 week old nude mice grafted with Raji cells (2x106 cells in 0.5 mL medium solution) after injection of radioactive Lu-177-Rituximab.Results and discussionThe 3 day protocol of freeze drying without the presence of mannitol, showed the greatest similarity in the elution profiles of the immunoconjugate prior lyophilization (Gholipour, 2014). After freeze drying, the pellets obtained corresponded to the composition and the time until complete reconstitution after addition of saline showed no significant difference in the time of complete dissolution of the lyophilisates, i.e. all tested samples were completely reconstituted in 2 min.The average number of BFCA attached to each anti-body molecule performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrom-etry shows presence of two main peaks corresponding to MW of 146491 Da (unconjugated antibody) and 149873 Da (conjugated antibody) which corresponds to an average of 6.1 groups of p-SCN-Bn-DOTA (M = 551.61 g\u00b7mol-1), two peaks also, corresponding to MW of 146477 Da (unconju-gated antibody) and 151246 Da (conjugated antibody) corre-sponds to an average of 8.8 groups of p-SCN-Bn-DTPA (M = 540.54 g\u00b7mol-1) attached to a molecule of rituximab and two peaks corresponding to MW of 146848 Da (unconjugat-ed antibody) and 151506 Da (conjugated antibody) corre-sponding to average of 8.3 groups 1B4M-DTPA (M = 555.58 g\u00b7mol-1) attached to a molecule of rituximab.All immunoconjugates (both before and after lyophili-zation) were separated in two distinct Mw species which mi-grated in two bands (upper at ~50 kDa and lower at ~25 kDa) confirming the migration behavior typical for IgG antibod-ies which are composed of twoidentical subunits each com-posed by two polypeptide chains: two heavy and two light chains, linked via 4 disulfide bonds. The obtained fragments correspond to molecular masses of rituximab heavy and light chain given at the literature (Bil, 2007;)In the experimental IR (in the region 2000-500 cm-1) and Raman spectra (2000\u2013400 cm-1 region) we observed retaining of native structure of the antibody and no obvious aggregation.The radiochemical purity and determination of radioimmunoconjugates by SE-HPLC,  obtained after radiolabeling the with Lu-177 was higher than 5%. These conjugates were stable for 48h in 0.9% NaCl, however, progressive aggregation was observed.Animal studies showed no toxicity and SPECT images in mice showed good localization of the tumor, as confirmed by ex-vivo organ counting. ConclusionAfter evaluation of all the obtained results obtained we can conclude:- Three immunoconjugates were synthesized, using p-SCN-Bn-DOTA, p-SCN-Bn-DTPA and 1B4M-DTPA using the a selected ratio, 1:20- Protocol for lyophilization was established, yielding lyophilisates with favorable physicochemical properties.- The non-radioactive labeling with Y and Lu showed preserved secondary structure in all three types of immunoconjugate, confirming their stability in conditions of freeze-drying and labeling- During labeling with Lu-177 all three types of radioimmunoconjugates showed high radiochemical purity, over 95%, which was confirmed both in ITLC and SE-HPLC.The selection of the most appropriate immunoconjugate kit suitable for labeling with Lu-177 or with Y-90 can be made after stability study of the formulation and completition of cell culture studies.ReferencesBil, J., Winiarska, M., 2007.

These infections are not uniquely associated with any clinical subtype, but severe axonal degeneration is more common following C. jejuni (Hughes et al., 1999). Experimental evidence implicates concomitant production of specific serum antibodies against several types of gan-gliosides that was thought to play an important role in the development of the disease (Willison and Yuki, 2002). On the other hand, proteins belonging to the family of heat shock proteins (HSP) are also believed to be etiological factors in many autoimmune diseases whose pathophysiol-ogies are thought to stem from immune responses against HSP (Yonekura et al., 2004).Hence, to shed further light on the mechanisms that trigger the immune responses in post infectious autoim-mune diseases such as GBS, the aim of this study was to investigate the profiles and immunoreactivity of proteins from human peripheral nerve (HPN) tissue, the main path-ological target of the disease, and from C. Jejuni (O:19), as the most often causative agent for GBS. Materials and methodsIn the first part of the study, proteins were isolated from HPN and C. Jejuni (serotype O:19, ATCC 43446). Human peripheral nerve was obtained at autopsy within 8 hr after death from patients who died from non-neuro-logical disease (Department of Forensic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, Macedonia). Afterward proteins were extracted, separated by 1D SDS-PAGE using a Protean IIxi electrophoresis cell (Protean IIxi, BioRad), and their potential cross reactivity identified by Western blotting. The electrophoretic bands containing the proteins of interest were isolated, subject-ed to trypsin digestion, the resulting peptides submitted to nHPLC-nESI-MS and MS/MS (Dionex UltiMate3000 nanoflow LC system connected to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL) analysis and the results elaborated using SEQUEST algo-rithm (Proteome Discoverer 1.3, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rodano, MI, Italy) for proteins identification and evalua-tion of their similarities.Results and discussionWestern blot analysis of the immunoreactivity of iso-lated proteins to sera from patients with GBS, revealed sig-nals for at least 8 immunoreactive bands for HPN and 8 for C. jejuni O:19 \u2013 GBS. Bands corresponding to proteins associated to the strongest immunogenic response (60-70 S6 OP 257540Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 539 - 540 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular ScienceskDa) and bands that revealed positive but weaker signal (45 kDa), were subjected to proteomic analysis.For C. jejuni, no proteins were identifiable with suffi-cient confidence level in the band corresponding to Mw~45 kDa, while at Mw~60-70 kDa, 11 proteins were identified. Among them, 2 out of 3 and 7 out of 11 proteins respective-ly, were proteins previously identified in microorganisms from the genre Campylobacter, while the remaining pro-teins were in the overall from other microorganisms. All these proteins were from the family of chaperone/co-chap-erone proteins (GroEL, DnaK and HtpG). By contrast, the main proteins identified in the corre-sponding 45 kDa HPN band were enzymes and structur-al proteins. In HPN, proteins identified in the mass range around 70 kDa (the SDS-PAGE band associated to the strongest immunogenic response) were human serum al-bumin (HSA) neurofilament light peptide and different forms of cytoskeletal keratin. Three proteins from the HSP 70 family (heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A/1B mw=70KDa, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein mw=70.9 KDa, and heat shock-related 70 kDa protein 2 mw=70 KDa) were found, as well as HSP 60 (mw=60 KDa). Cross verification of these proteins in UniProt bacterial proteins database ren-dered as reliable matching proteins (similarity score above 45%) those belonging to bacterial chaperone DnaK pro-teins.In a recent study, de Jong and colleague reported the identification of seven epitopes present at different posi-tions along the in constitutive self HSP 70 (De Jong et al., 2014). Alignment of these peptides with the corresponding sequences in the above selected chaperones from different Campylobacter species (Mw~70 kDa) and human HSP 70, showed that two of those epitopes showed ~100% of se-quence homology.In analogy to what done for HSP 70, the presence of the HSP 60 consensus sequence L256xxLxxNxLxxxxxxx-AVKAPGFGDxRKxx reported by Elfaitouri et al. (2013) was verified after alignment of mitochondrial 60 kDa heat shock protein identified in HPN with GroEL chaperone and with 60 kDa chaperonin (both proteins share around 50% of similarity with HSP 60). In the cases of GroEL chaperone there was total coincidence of all key amino ac-ids, while for 60 kDa chaperonin only lys264 was replaced by an isoleucine residue.Therefore, the microbial chaperone proteins DnaK (~70 kDa) and the different forms of HSP 70 in HPN iden-tified in this study, as well as bacterial GroEL an human HSP 60, reciprocally share high primary sequence homol-ogy and conservation of their known epitopes. C. jejuni chaperone proteins (~70 kDa) can be suggest-ed as possible antigens determining the induction of auto-immune disorders such as GBS or, at least, to play a rel-evant role in these diseases, possibly through a molecular mimicry mechanism (Elfaitouri et al., 2013).In particular, in our case, it can be speculated that the HSP neuroprotective effect (after activation of the heat shock response in consequence of infection) may be inhib-ited due to the interference of specific anti-HSP antibodies, eliciting the neurodegenerative effect of anti-GM1 autoan-tibodies on the peripheral nervous system.ConclusionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in-vestigating the molecular identity of cross reacting, immu-nogenic proteins involved in GBS. The high resolution and mass accuracy provided by the Orbitrap analyzer, allowed to obtain an extensive, although presumably incomplete, identification of candidate proteins such as human and bac-terial HSP. The results of this study confirmed that C. jejuni DnaK (~70 kDa) and human peripheral nerve HSP 70, and bacterial GroEL and human HSP 60 share high sequence homology, in good accordance with the massive amount of work showing that HSP are highly conserved in evolution, leading to magnificent similarities in structure and com-position between mammalian HSPs and their homologues in microorganisms. Taken altogether, these results strong-ly suggest a potential involvement of chaperone molecules in the development of the autoimmune response associat-ed to GBS.Hence, further studies that could help identify new molecular targets in inflammatory and autoimmune condi-tions such as GBS should be focused on the better under-standing of the multifaceted contribution of HSPs in im-mune response and inflammation, thus to allow the devel-opment of new diagnostic, therapeutical and pharmaceuti-cal tools for the treatment of these harmful diseases.ReferencesDe Jong, H., Koffeman, E.C., Meerding, J.M., Scholman, R.C., Wieten, L., De Jager, W., Klein, M., Otten, H., Van Wijk, F., Van Der Zee, R., Bijlsma, J.W.J., Broere, F., Van Eden, W., Prakken, B.J., 2014.

In addition, CRC tumors are often comprised of cytogenetically different clones that arise from the initial transformed cell through different secondary or tertiary ge-netic alterations. This significant molecular heterogeneity of CRC leads to differences in the clinical presentation and response to the therapy, and therefore affects the clinical management of the patients.The vast majority of the CRC cases (~75%) is described as sporadic CRC and has no apparent predisposing etiology. However, in recent years, a couple of particular morpholog-ical subtypes of sporadic CRC have been recognized (Jass, 2007). All of these subtypes present rather different clini-cal features and molecular signatures and potentially have different underlying molecular origins. Sporadic microsat-ellite stable (MSS) tumors usually arise through the clas-sical adenoma-carcinoma pathway and demonstrate a high level of chromosomal instability (CIN) and mutations in genes as APC, KRAS, TP53, TGFBR2, PI3KCA etc. Muta-tions in KRAS (predominantly point mutations in codon 12 and 13) lead to a constitutively active GTP-bound protein and subsequent downstream activation of the MAPK sig-naling cascade rising to unregulated proliferation and dif-ferentiation of the cancer cells. Moreover, somatic chang-es in KRAS are thought to be an early event in colon carci-nogenesis and appear concordant between primary tumor and metastatic sites (Artale et al., 2008). Their role as neg-ative predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR targeted therapy (cetuximab, panitumumab) is well established (Javle and Hsueh 2009). However, the data from the studies explor-ing the potential role of the KRAS mutations as prognostic biomarkers or as predictive biomarkers for standard 5-flu-orouracil based adjuvant therapy are less consistent, which in part can be due to the significant heterogeneity of the as-say methodology and the datasets that are analyzed. Hav-ing that in mind, we conducted a prospective study in order to evaluate the possible prognostic effect of the KRAS mu-tations in patients treated with capecitabine adjuvant mono-therapy and to better understand the relationship between KRAS-mutation status and survival after CRC diagnosis.Materials and methodsStudy population A total of 97 patients with histologically proven stage III or high-risk stage II colon cancer were included in the study. All recruited patients underwent a surgical resection of the tumors and were submitted to capecitabine adjuvant therapy according to standard protocol. After the completion of the therapy, follow-up visits were scheduled for a total of 5 years. MSI analysis Microsatellite instability in tumor samples was ana-lyzed with multiplex fluorescent polymerase chain reaction S6 OP 258542Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 541 - 542 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencesfollowed by capillary electrophoresis on 3500 Automat-ed Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, USA). MSI sta-tus was determined using 9 STR markers: BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S107, D5S346, D17S250, D18S58, D18S61 and D18S535 derived from the panel of microsatellite loci defined by the NCI (Boland et al., 1998). The tumor sam-ples were classified as MSI if instability was present at more of 30% of the loci screened.KRAS mutation analysis KRAS mutations were analyzed in tumor samples us-ing custom designed assay. Exon 2 of the KRAS gene was amplified using the following primers: AAGGCCTGCT-GAAAATGACTG and AGAATGGTCCTGCACCAG-TAA.  Bi-directional sequencing was performed using Big-Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit. Sequencing products were purified using BigDye XTerminator\u00ae Pu-rification Kit (Life Technologies, USA) and analyzed by a capillary electrophoresis on a 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, USA).Statistical analysis Differences in the demographic and clinical character-istics of the patients were tested using unpaired Student t-test (continuous variables) or Fisher\u2019s exact test (categori-cal variables). The primary end-point of the study was dis-ease-free survival (DFS), defined as the time from end of the adjuvant therapy to the first recurrence diagnosis. Sur-vival curves were generated according to the Kaplan and Meier method and survival distributions were compared with the use of the log-rank test. Hazard ratios and 95 per-cent confidence intervals were computed with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression model.Results and discussionA mutation in exon 2 of the KRAS gene was observed in a total of 26 (26.8%) patients, of which 21 (21.6%) in co-don 12 and 5 (5.2%) in codon 13. The most common muta-tion was Gly12Asp which accounted for 38.5% of all KRAS mutations. There was no statistically significant association between the KRAS mutations and the clinical features of pa-tients, although there was a trend towards higher incidence of KRAS mutations in patients with stage III CRC (p=0.07). The survival analyses showed an association of the KRAS mutations with a shorter DFS; the five-year survival of pa-tients carriers of KRAS mutation was 42.3% versus 73.2% in patients with wild-type KRAS (p=0.004). The multivari-ate analysis adjusted for the gender, stage and tumor localiza-tion, showed that the presence of KRAS mutation is an inde-pendent predictor for poor prognosis in patients treated with adjuvant capecitabine monotherapy (HR 2.48; 95% CI 1,23-5,01; p=0.011). This leads to a conclusion that only wild-type KRAS CRC patients could benefit from adjuvant capecitabine monotherapy. The association of KRAS mutations with poor DFS was even more evident in patients with microsatellite stable tumors. The 5-year survival of patients with MSS tu-mors harboring KRAS mutation in codon 12 or 13 was 31.8% versus patients with wild-type KRAS, where the survival is 71.9% (p=0.001). The hazard ratio of 2.64 (CI 1.22 \u2013 5.70; p=0.014) indicate an increase in the risk of relapse in patients with MSS tumors compared to unselected group of patients. In models stratified according to clinicopathologic character-istics, no difference in DFS was observed in patients with stage II and III, i.e. the presence of KRAS mutation was asso-ciated with poor outcome of treatment with capecitabine re-gardless of stage. However, different patterns in survival were observed according to gender of the patients, where the pres-ence of the KRAS mutation remained a strong negative pre-dictive factor for DFS only in male patients (HR 4.87; 95% CI 1.94 \u2013 12.20; p< 0,001), where the average five-year sur-vival of carriers of KRAS mutation was 29 months compared to 83.5 months in patients with wild-type KRAS (p<0.001). In contrast, in the female subgroup of patients, the presence of KRAS mutations had no significant effect on survival (58 vs. 79.7 months, p=0.93). Since there is no significant difference in the frequency of KRAS mutations according to the gender (p=0.71), these differences in survival are probably not due a statistical error, and represent the possible protective effect of the estrogen hormones.ConclusionThe mutations in the KRAS gene are a strong negative predictive factor for survival after adjuvant capecitabine monotherapy, especially in male patients. Routine KRAS testing can give significant contribution towards decision making regarding the treatment strategies in CRC by identi-fying patients with a highly aggressive disease and poor sur-vival irrespective of the capecitabine adjuvant monotherapy.ReferencesArtale, S., Sartore-Bianchi, A., Veronese, S.M., Gambi, V., Sarnataro, C.S., Gambacorta, M., Lauricella, C., Siena, S., 2008.

In Escherichia coli AG102 and Acinetobacter baumannii SBMox2 strains the well char-acterized RND efflux pumps are AcrAB-TolC and the Ad-eABC respectively. Most of the antibiotics were found to be substrates for these pumps by increasing the expression of the efflux pump genes, leading to multidrug resistance (MDR) and the treatment failure and death caused by these gram negative bacterial infections or underlying diseases are common (Sun et al., 2014). Consequently, the need of searching new therapeutic solutions that suppress the ac-tivity of efflux pumps and restore the sensitivity of com-monly used antibiotic is essential.RND efflux pumps, which are only found in Gram-neg-ative bacteria, have a tripartite composition. RND type ef-flux pumps contain an inner membrane transporter protein (RND pump), an outer membrane protein (OMP) channel, and a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP). They are allowed direct extrusion of various antibiotics from the cytosol or periplasmic space to the outside of the bacteri-al cell, and have been found to be associated extensive-ly with clinically significant antibiotic resistance (Sun et al., 2014).Recent studies reported that RND type efflux pumps, which are named AcrAB-TolC in E. coli and AdeABC in A. baumannii, comprise a transporter protein (RND pump) AcrB in E. coli or AdeB in A. baumannii acting as a pro-ton/drug antiporter, an outer membrane channel protein TolC in E. coli or AdeC in A. baumannii, and a periplasmic membrane fusion protein AcrA, which serves as a linker between TolC and AcrB in E. coli or AdeB, which serves as a linker between AdelC and AdeB in A. baumannii (Sun et al., 2014). The emergence of MDR strains of Gram-negative bac-teria pathogens is a problem of ever increasing significance (Sun et al. 2014). Interestingly, these RND efflux pumps decrease the antibacterial activity of dissimilar antibiotic structures, which can be considered a MDR mechanism. Because of bacteria become insensitive to different classes of antibiotic therapy, new therapeutic approaches must be looked for, searching for new molecules to block efflux, to restore drug susceptibility to resistant clinical strains.The goal of this study is (i) to define the potential RND efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) activity of our previously syn-thesized BSN coded 2-substituted benzothiazoles by ob-serving the reversal antibacterial activity of antibiotics particularly to chloramphenicol (CHL) and/or ciprofloxa-cin (CIP) in the AdeABC efflux pump overexpressor Aci-netobacter baumannii SbMox2 and/or AcrAB-TolC ef-flux pump overexpressor E. coli AG102 clinical isolates, and (ii) to examine the structure activity relationships by describing the binding site features of these tested com-pounds and to analyze the active site protein-ligand inter-actions of RND efflux pump AdeABC in A. baumannii by generating pharmacophore hypothesis.Materials and methodsA well-known standard microdilution assay was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of our previously synthesized BSN coded 2-substituted S6 PP 259544Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 543 - 544 (2016)Poster presentationsClinical pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular sciencesbenzothiazoles derivatives (Yilmaz et al. 2013), CHL and CIP and MICs of CHL and CIP were determined in the presence and absence of the BSN coded compounds. A common feature pharmacophore hypothesis, Hi-pHop method, was generated by using the Accelrys Dis-covery Studio 2.1 software to explain the specification of the structure activity relationships of pharmacophoric sites of the tested BSN coded 2-substituted benzothiazoles in the targeted AdeABC efflux pump. This tool builds phar-macophore hypotheses (overlaying common features) for which the fit of individual molecules to a hypothesis could be correlated with activity of the molecule. A set of potential AdeABC efflux pump inhibitors of BSN coded 2-substituted benzothiazoles, which exhibited 16-folds or greater reduction in the MIC value of CHL af-ter used in combination in A. baumannii SbMox-2, was se-lected as the EPI active training set to use in the HipHop pharmacophore generation method. Among the tested BSN coded compounds, the most active molecules, BSN4, BSN6, and BSN23, were used to derive common fea-ture-based alignments and considered as \u201creference com-pounds\u201d specifying a principal value of 2 and a maximum omitting features value of 0.Results and discussionFor the antibacterial activity test against A. bauman-nii SbMox-2 and/or E. coli AG102 clinical isolates, BSN coded 2-substituted benzothiazoles were first tested alone to observe their intrinsic antibacterial affinity. Howev-er, when they were tested alone they did not exhibit any significant intrinsic antibacterial activity. But, when they were tested in combinations with CHL or CIP against the AdeABC overexpressor A. baumannii SbMox-2 mutant, a reversal in the antibacterial activity of 22, 20 fold dou-ble dilution better MIC values were observed respectively for CHL and CIP. Moreover, the combinations of the test-ed compounds with CHL or CIP against the AcrAB-TolC overexpressor E. coli AG102 strain were exhibited a rever-sal antibacterial activity of 6, 10 fold double dilution better MIC values respectively for CHL and CIP. Among the test-ed BSN coded benzothiazoles, BSN4, BSN6, and BSN23 reversal the antibacterial activity of CHL revealing a MIC values of 0.125 \u00b5g/ml against the AdeABC overexpressor A. baumannii SbMox-2 strain.The generated 3D-common feature pharmacophore hypothesis containing two Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA) and three Hydrophobic Aromatics (HpAr) was an-ticipated as the common-feature functions to explain the pharmacophoric site specifications of the EPI activity of BSN coded 2-substituted benzothiazole compounds. The generated pharmacophore model reveals that the two HBA and three HpAr features are found significant for binding to the active site of the target protein. Three HpAr features demonstrate the appropriate active shape of the molecule, displaying the required place of bulky aromatic moieties. Two HBA atoms or groups at the given positions are neces-sary in the molecule to bind to the target protein.ConclusionThe generated pharmacophore model revealed that when the tested compounds substituted by a benzyl group instead of phenyl ring attached to the benzothiazole nu-cleus then, they could not be able to show any match with the hydrogen bond acceptor feature of nitrogen atom in the thiazole ring at the fused ring system. Therefore, these compounds showed lower fit value and were not able to match with all the mapped pharmacophore common-fea-tures in the anticipated model. This observation explains why 2-phenylbenzotiazole structure is more favourable than 2-benzylbenzotiazole for increasing potency in this set of compounds.In conclusion, the generated 3D-common feature pharmacophore hypothesis reveals that the conformation-al properties of the compounds are significant for the Ade-ABC efflux pump inhibitor activity against the multi-drug resistant A. baumannii SbMox-2 strain and compounds possessing 2-[4-(4-substituted-2-phenyl-acetamido)phe-nyl]benzothiazole and/or 2-[4-(4-substituted-3-phenylpro-pionamido)phenyl]benzothiazole structures are important for improving the AdeABC efflux pump inhibitor potency.ReferencesSun, J., Deng, Z., Yan, A., 2014.

The symptomatic disorder of the nasal mucosa and tissue is associated with an IgE-mediated immune response to allergens and is characterized by two phases: an immediate response after allergen exposure (early phase) and a late phase occurring up to 12 hours later, which predominantly causes nasal congestion (Calderon Moises et al., 2010). If a concurrent respiratory infection is present, a patient\u2019s probability of developing bronchial asthma as comorbidity increases. Likewise, the risk of developing further allergies with more severe symptoms rises over the time of the disease (http://www.bitop.de).The optimal treatment of allergic rhinitis depends on several individual factors. A stepwise therapeutic approach, however, is generally recommended. Current guidelines favour second-generation oral or topical H1 antihistamines for treating allergic rhinitis (Angier et al., 2010). More-over, intranasal glucocorticosteroids and intranasal decon-gestants are highly recommended as effective treatments for nasal blockage (Bousquet et al., 2008).Azelastine is a new-generation antihistamine applied topically as nasal spray or eye drops. It is used as treatment of allergic rhinitis, hay fever, and allergic conjunctivitis. Although azelastine is regarded as effective possible first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis, common side effects, such as bitter taste of the drug and local irritation reactions and rare side effects such as fatigue or headache, can occur.Ectoine (2-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxyclic acid) is a compatible solute which is natural-ly produced by bacteria, conferring resistance to external stress factors such as extreme temperatures, high salt con-centrations, and ultraviolet radiation. It acts via a mecha-nism called \u201cpreferential exclusion\u201d and \u201cpreferential hy-dration (DEGAM, 2008). Ectoine is expelled from proteins or lipid membranes, resulting in the modulation of the sol-vent characteristic of surrounding water. Thus, ectoine is able to form a protective and stabilizing hydrate cap-sule around the protein and therefore helps to protect bio-molecules and proteins from irreversible structural mod-ifications by inhibiting dehydration. This indirect effect leads to a more compact and more stable folding of pro-teins and increases the stability of lipid membranes by in-creasing their fluidity (Dirschka, 2008). The effect derives from the mechanism of halophilic bacteria which stabilis-es the osmotic balance in the microorganic cell, where ex-tremolytes such as ectoine are accumulated in the cytosol to equal out the varying salt concentration in the outer area (Lentzen and Schwarz, 2012). Stabilization of membranes such as those lining the airways or eyes might reduce the potential water loss of such membranes and protect them against invading allergens, thereby limiting the inflamma-tory cascade induced by stress mediators at the membrane level, as has been shown for lung epithelia and skin cells (Lentzen and Schwarz, 2012). In vitro experiments have further shown that ectoine inhibits apoptosis, triggered by nanoparticles (Smiatek et al., 2012), and likewise blocks the activity of ceramides, which are regarded as central molecules in the sphingolipid metabolism as well as in the induction of apoptosis (Sydlik et al. (a), 2009). Current-ly, ectoine is used in dermatological products for success-fully treating skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Syd-lik et al. (b), 2013). Still widely unknown is the use of ec-toine in nasal sprays or eye drops. In such medical devic-es, ectoine may strengthen the hydroprotection of the nasal membrane and may alleviate the infection of the inflamed tissue (Vestweber, 2009).S6 PP 260546Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 545 - 546 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsToxicological studies and results of human studies re-flect the excellent safety profile of products containing ec-toine, therewith making them promising candidates for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (Vestweber, 2009).Review from clinical studiesIn order to investigate the efficacy of treatment with ectoine, data from published as well as unpublished clinical studies were reviewed.The current noninterventional, open-label study inves-tigated treatment of allergic rhinitis comparing the intra-nasal glucocorticoid beclomethasone with that of ectoine containing nasal spray. Within the study, different mode of action, on the one hand the glucocorticoid, was compared to a physical, membrane stabilizing molecule. Important-ly, it was shown that nasal symptom scores of both treat-ment groups improved significantly over the study period of 14 days. Although advantages of the beclomethasone spray in comparison with the ectoine spray were shown, re-sults of the ectoine group showed its potential clinical effi-cacy. Glucocorticoids bind to specific glucocorticoid recep-tors which are present on almost all cells of the body. Fol-lowing binding, transcription of a number of inflammato-ry cytokines and chemokines can be modulated, which in turn results in decreased recruitment and activation of in-flammatory cells. In allergic rhinitis, this results in a quick improvement of inflammatory symptoms which was con-firmed in the results of the beclomethasone group. Oppo-sitely, ectoine acts physically via a mechanism called \u201cpref-erential exclusion.\u201d In the presence of ectoine, membranes and lipids are protected indirectly. As ectoine is expelled from the surface of proteins and lipids, those are protect-ed by a water shell, thereby increasing the fluidity of mem-branes and resulting in the preferential formation of the na-tive conformation of proteins. This might stabilize mucous membranes such as lining epithelia of the nose, thereby protecting those from invading allergens and reducing al-lergen-induced inflammations as shown in different model systems and as reported in congress report. It is understood that many allergens which cause allergic rhinitis symptoms have protease activities which act by impairing epithelial barrier function. This in turn results in increased penetra-tion of allergens into nasal mucosa. The barrier stabilizing properties of ectoine may counteract this scenario by im-proving the epithelial barrier and stabilizing membranes. In allergic rhinitis, this might protect the nasal mucosae from invading allergens, resulting in improvement of symptoms.A recent placebo-controlled study in an environmental challenge chamber showed that 3 hours after application of the ectoine nasal spray and eye drops the symptoms were decreased by ~20%.ConclusionTaken together, this meta-analysis demonstrated that the application of ectoine-based nasal spray and eye drops improves symptoms of allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis. This easy-to-apply, well-tolerated, naturally-based nasal and ocular treatment, which has no unpleasant taste and virtually no side effects, effectively reduces allergic rhinitis symptoms and represents an exciting alternative for rhinoconjunctivitis sufferers.ReferencesAngier, E., Willington, J., Scadding, G., Holmes, S., Walker, S., 2010.

Inherited variations in the TPMT enzyme activity are especially important in determination of individual differences between patients regarding the therapeutic response as well as the toxic effects of AZA treatment (Al Hadithy et al., 2005; Ansari et al., 2002). Additionally, inherited variations in TPMT enzyme activity have an impact on production of active 6-thioguanine nucleotide metabolite (6-TGN) after administration of AZA or 6-mercaptopurine (Wright et al., 2004). Regarding this, higher concentration of 6-TGN metabolite (235-450 pmol/8x108 Er) means better outcome of the disease activity, and therapeutic response as well (Cuffari et al., 2011; Dubinsky et al., 2000).The aims of this study were to assess the relationship between TPMT enzyme activity and concentration of 6-TGN metabolite and to determine the impact of concentration of 6-TGN metabolite on the disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, treated with AZA.Materials and methodsThirty-nine (39) patients with IBD from the Gastro-enterohepatology clinic, Skopje were included in this study. All of them had used AZA in a period of more than 3 months. Determination of TPMT enzyme activity was performed using the ELISA method (Bradford and Shih, 2011). 3-5mL of blood volume was taken in a tube with EDTA or heparin as an anticoagulant. In a period of 30 minutes after the blood draw, samples were centrifuged (1000g, 15 min.). Plasma was taken out and freezed on -20  or  -80\u00b0\u0421 until analysed. The technique of determi-nation of the TPMT enzyme activity using ELISA meth-od was performed in accordance with the reference manu-al of the manufacturer of the ELISA kit, \u201cHumanThiopu-rineMethyltransferase (TPMT) ELISA Kit, My BioSource, USA. In order to establish a control group, blood samples were taken from healthy volunteers as well. Eritrocytes were than isolated from the blood sample and concentra-tion of the 6-TGN was determined using the HPLC meth-od. The bioanalytical method was validated according to the EMA Guideline on validation of bioanalytical method (EMA, 2011). The disease activity was assessed using the well known, Crohn\u2019s disease activity index (CDAI) (Gas-che et al., 2000) and the Ulcerative colitis activity index (UCAI) (Walmsey et al., 1998). According to the concen-tration of 6-TGN metabolite, patients were divided in three groups: subtherapeutic group (<200 pmol/8x108 Er); ther-S6 PP 261548Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 547 - 548 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsapeutic (200-400 pmol/8x108 Er) and overdosed (>400 pmol/8x108 Er) (Smith et al., 2013). Results assessment of 6-TGN metabolite concentration in patients was estab-lished for the first time in Macedonia in a collaboration be-tween two institutions, Department of Preclinical and Clin-ical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical Faculty, Sko-pje and the Faculty of Pharmacy, Skopje.Results and discussionThe average value of TPMT enzyme activity in all pa-tients was 18,49 U/mL  \u0415r \u00b1 8.27 U/mL  \u0415r (min. 1.9 U/mL  \u0415r, max. 35.8 U/mL  \u0415r). The average value of 6-TGN metabolite concentration was 437,46 pmol/8x108 Er \u00b1 198.82 pmol/8x108 (min. 64.8 pmol/8x108 , max. 905.5 pmol/8x108). The results of this study have shown linear indirect moderate correlation between the TPMT enzyme activ-ity and 6-TGN metabolite concentration in patients with IBD treated with AZA (Spearman Rank Order Corellation: R=-0,3632). As the TPMT enzyme activity was increasing, 6-TGN concentration was decreasing (p>0,05). Adittionaly, and increased concentration of 6-TGN correlated with increased probability of remission.ConclusionMonitoring of 6-TGN metabolite concentration in combination with determination of the TPMT enzyme activity may predict the therapeutic response in patients with IBD treated with AZA. As well, the result suggests that the method could be useful for detection of patients who do not respond to this therapy in order to identify new alternative treatments.ReferencesAnsari, A., Hassan, C., Duley, J., Marinaki, A., Shobowale-Bakre, E.M., Seed, P., 2002.

Antifungal drugs are therapeutic agents ex-tensively used to treat these infections. They can be classi-fied in two groups: first, the natural antifungal antibiotics and second, synthetic drugs. According to the way of ad-ministration antifungal drugs can be topical and systemic agents. For the systemic, drug\u2019s properties such as absorp-tion, distribution, plasma protein binding, metabolism or route of elimination considerably influence their therapeu-tic success (Lemke and Williams, 2013). The drug\u2019s in vivo efficiency is significantly influenced by its plasma protein binding (PPB). In vivo the drug molecules can be bound to proteins and lipids in plasma, to proteins and lipids in tis-sues, or can be free (unbound) and diffuse among the aque-ous environment of the blood and tissues. Depending on a specific affinity for plasma protein, a portion of the bound and unbound drug may differ. In most cases, only free drug molecules interact with the therapeutic target, a receptor, to produce effective therapy results and free drug\u2019s fraction is the one that can be metabolized and excreted. One of the advantages of drug modeling is the ability to find an opti-mal drug PPB range (Lemke and Williams, 2013). A number of drug\u2019s molecular physicochemical prop-erties notably influence its ADME properties. Lipophilici-ty, molecular weight, molecular volume, polar surface area and solubility play important roles in drug absorption, pen-etration into tissues, distribution as well as the degree of plasma protein binding and route of elimination. In our previous papers we studied the relationship between An-giotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\u2019s lipophilicity and protein binding data (Odovic and Trbojevic-Stankovic, 2012). Furthermore, the aim of this study was to investi-gate the relationship between computed molecular proper-ties of seven selected systemic antifungal drugs and their plasma protein binding (PPB) data available in literature. Materials and methodsSeven selected systemic antifungal drugs, amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, terbinafine and voriconazole were investigated in this study.The PPB degree data for selected antifungal agents was obtained from relevant literature (Lemke and Wil-liams, 2013;  www.drugbank.ca). The values of antifun-gal drugs\u2019 molecular descriptors, aqueous solubility (logS), electronic descriptor - polar surface area (PSA), constitu-tional parameter - molecular weight (Mw), geometric de-scriptor - volume value (Vol) and seven different lipophi-licity parameters, logP values (AlogPs, AClogP, milogP, AlogP, MlogP, XlogP2 and XlogP3) were calculated us-ing two different software packages (www.molinspira-tion.com; www.vcclab.org).  The selection of most suitable logP value was evaluated on the basis its best agreement with values of PPB obtained from literature. Microsoft Excel 2003 and Origin 7.0 PRO (Origin Lab Corporation, USA) were used for statistical analysis.S6 PP 262550Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 549 - 550 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsResults and discussionAccording to the data obtained from literature, antifungal drugs mostly have relatively similar and high values of plasma protein binding. These values range from 90% for amphotericin B to 99.8% for itraconazole. Ketoconazole, posaconazole and terbinafine have also high and almost equal values of PPB (99%, 98%, 99%, respectively) while fluconazole and voriconazole represent exceptions with their lower values of plasma protein binding (12% and 58% , respectively) (www.drugbank.ca). The five molecular descriptors, logP, PSA, Mw, Vol and logS, for all studied systemic antifungal drugs were calculated using software packages, Virtual Computational Chemistry Laboratory and Molinspiration Depiction Software (www.molinspiration.com; www.vcclab.org).The methods used for logP calculation can be divided into property-based and substructure-based methods and there are two groups of substructure-based methods: fragmental and atom-based. The differences between calculation methods led to distinctions between absolute logP values. It is generally accepted that molecules with high lipophilicity show higher values of plasma protein binding in comparison to the less lipophilic ones with similar properties. Considering all this, in the first stage of the study the relationships between numbered calculated lipophilicity descriptors, logP values, and plasma protein binding data obtained from relevant literature for selected antifungal drugs were investigated using simple linear regression. The best correlation was obtained for the relationship between antifungal drugs\u2019 plasma protein binding data and AClogP lipophilicity descriptor. Consequently, lipophilicity descriptor AClogP was chosen for further correlations. Following, the correlations between plasma protein binding data and other calculated molecular descriptors, PSA, Mw, Vol, logS were investigated providing relatively poor correlation (R2 < 0.35). In continuation, the relationships between antifungal drugs\u2019 plasma protein binding data and two different molecular descriptors were investigated using multiple linear regression analysis (MLR). The relationship between antifungal drugs\u2019 protein binding data and their lipophilicity with application of additional molecular descriptors, Mw, Vol, PSA, logS as additional independent variables provided significantly higher correlations (with R2 varying from 0.81 to 0.85). The obtained relations are presented with following Equations (1)-(4).PPB predicted(%) = 12.699(\u00b13.213)AClogP + 0.046(\u00b10.027)Mw + 17.105(\u00b116.654) (1)With n = 7; R2 = 0.851; S.D. = 15.714; F = 11.451;PPBpredicted(%) = 12.406(\u00b13.306)AClogP + 0.049(\u00b10.030)Vol + 19.185(\u00b116.114) (2)With n = 7; R2 = 0.847; S.D. = 15.922; F = 11.101.PPBpredicted(%) = 14.921(\u00b13.477)AClogP + 0.097(\u00b10.072)PSA + 25.055(\u00b115.557) (3)With n = 7; R2 = 0.823; S.D. = 17.136; F = 9.312;PPBpredicted(%) = 15.144(\u00b13.618)AClogP \u2013 2.207(\u00b11.806)logS + 28.532(\u00b114.628) (4)With n = 7; R2 = 0.814; S.D. = 17.566; F = 8.764.As can be seen the best correlation was obtained using MLR analysis with application of two molecular descriptors, AClogP and Mw or AClogP and Vol data, as independent variables ((Equation (1) and (2)). However, all established correlations can be considered as good with R2 higher than 0.80.ConclusionThe discovery of new pharmacologically active substances and modeling of drugs with antifungal activity led to necessity of predicting drugs properties and their ADME data. The correlations that were found between antifungal drugs\u2019 plasma protein binding data and their calculated molecular descriptors, confirmed that lipophilicity accompanied with other molecular properties, such as molecular weight, volume value, polar surface area and aqueous solubility are essential for drugs plasma protein binding. The presented computational technique could be regarded as additional, in vitro approach appropriate for evaluation of plasma protein binding of investigated drugs especially important in design of new synthesized antifungal drugs, since only free drug molecules can interact with the receptor to produce effective therapy results.

While studying albumin, they discovered a slow reacting substance, which stimulated smooth muscle. They named it as a slow react-ing substance \u2013 SRS and based on the pharmacologic ac-tivity they managed to conclude that it was a unique sub-stance, found only in immunologically sensitized tissues by an antigen. Decades later, SRS was called anaphylaxis slow reacting substance (SRS-A).Zileuton is absorbed immediately after oral admin-istration and extensively metabolized by CYP and UDP glucuronosyltransferase. Even in this case, initial medi-cine is responsible for the therapeutic effect. Zileuton is a medicine with short effect and a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours and also very much bound to the proteins (93%). Pharmacologic effects of cys-LTs\u2019 occur not only as a con-sequence of the activation of cys-LT1 receptor; for exam-ple, cys-LTs\u2019 which trigger the vascular smooth muscle contraction (Gorenne et al., 1995). and stimulate expres-sion of the P-selectin generated by endothelial cells via re-ceptor LT2 (Pedersen et al., 1994).  Work studied the effect of antileukotriene \u2013Zileuton in the treatment of patients with bronchial asthma and in-creased bronchial reactivity, comparing it with control group treated with salbutamol (beta2 adrenergic receptor agonist) applied via inhalation. Materials and methodsFormation of leukotrienes depends on the lypoxygen-ation of the arachidonic acid by 5-lypoxygenase. Zileuton is an active and powerful inhibitor of the activity of 5-ly-poxygenase and as such inhibits generation of its products. Consequently, besides inhibition of cys-LTs\u2019, zileuton also inhibits the formation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which is a powerful chemotactic of other eicosanoids too, which de-pend on the synthesis of leukotriene A4 (LTA4). Theoreti-cally, therapeutic effects of 5-lipoxygenase should include all those seen at the antagonist cys-LT1, but also other ef-fects which include inhibition of the LTB4 and other prod-ucts of 5-lipoxygenase. Pharmacologic effects of cys-LTs\u2019 occur not only as a consequence of the activation of cys-LT1 receptor; for ex-ample, cys-LTs\u2019 which trigger the vascular smooth muscle contraction (Gorenne et al., 1995) and stimulate expression of the P-selectin generated by endothelial cells via receptor LT2 (Pedersen et al., 1994). Work studied the effect of antileukotriene \u2013Zileuton in the treatment of patients with bronchial asthma and in-creased bronchial reactivity, comparing it with control group treated with salbutamol (beta2 adrenergic receptor agonist) applied via inhalation. SRaw = Raw x ITGVRaw and the SRaw were taken for analyses. Parameters of the lung function are determined with Body plethysmography. Raw and ITGV were registered and specific resistance (SRaw) was calculated. In persons with bronchial asthma and increased bron-chial reactivity (n=21), Zileuton applied in a dose of 600 mg first day (oral route administration, 4 x 1 tabl.). After measurement of initial values, 1 capsule 600 mg of zileu-S6 PP 263552Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 551 - 552 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationston applied and measured Raw and ITGV after 60, 90 and 120 min. In the end, in terms of control, applied salbuta-mol (beta2-adrenergic agonist) in the form of aerosol and in a dose of (2 inh. x 0,2 mg); Raw and ITGV values were measured again and SRaw was calculated.   Zileuton, as antagonist of leukotriene receptor (600 mg, tablet) administered orally 2 days in row at home (4 x 600 mg) and after 1 day, respectively 2 days reported at the ambulance and measured initial values, tablet administered orally at the ambulance, and measured Raw and ITGV af-ter 60, 90 and 120 min. At the end, as control, administered salbutamol (beta2-adrenergic agonist) in the form of aero-sol and in a dose of (2 inh. x 0,2 mg), and Raw and ITGV values were measured again and SRaw was calculated.  Gained results grouped and analysed. Statistic data processing included determination of the average values (X), standard deviation (SD), standard mistake (SEM), and testing of significance of changes in between groups of pa-tient treated with antileukotriene substances. Gained results tested with a t-test in order to ascertain significant changes in between examined groups. In order to compare groups, utilized was statistic test ANOVA. This test is used in cases when necessary to evaluate more than two groups. Potential mistakes with t \u2013 test avoided with ANOVA used as a method of statistic test. Results and discussionResults of this research, in patients with bronchial asthma, indicate that Zileuton administered in a dose of 600 mg first day (oral route administration, 4 x 1 tabl.) has not caused significant decrease of the specific resistance (SRaw) of airways (p value 0.1 > Apha 0.05). Zileuton, administered 2 days in a row in a dose of 600 mg (4 x 1 tabl. per day), has caused significant decrease of the specific resistance (SRaw) of airways (p value 0.03 < Alpha 0.05). Treatment of the control group with salbuta-mol (agonist of beta2-adrenergic receptor) is also efficient in removal of the increased bronchomotor tonus, causing significant decrease of the resistance (Raw), respectively of the specific resistance (SRaw), (p value 0.05 = Alpha 0.05). Antagonists of leukotriene in doses administered 1 and 2 days after administration of Zileuton at home in the same pa-tient, does not significantly cause decrease of the arterial sys-tolic and diastolic pressure (AP) (p value 0.1 > Alpha 0.05). Clinical trials with antileukotriene medicines were quite heterogeneous in response to the therapy, with pa-tients that can be classified in two groups, those \u201crespond-ing\u201d on the treatment and those \u201cnot responding\u201d on it. For patients responding to the treatment with antileukotri-ene, heart, lungs, and blood treatment clinics have recog-nized these medicines as alternative to inhaled steroids, in small doses, in order to maintain slight chronic asthma un-der the control. More studies are needed to define the role of these medicines in moderate and severe asthma. (Barnes and Miller, 2000). Some clinical trials indicated that an-tagonists of leukotriene have an affinity in reduction of the dose of inhaled steroids necessary to control asthma exac-erbations (Jarvis and Markham, 2000). Side effects of the patients administering zileuton are similar to those of patients administering placebo. In esti-mated 4 to 5% of the patients administering zileuton there is an increase of liver enzymes responsibly within 2 first months of treatment. Hepatic enzymes should be moni-tored in patients that have just entered the treatment with zileuton, in order to be protected from a potential toxici-ty of the liver. ConclusionResults of this research indicate that Zileuton, ad-ministered in a dose of 600 mg (oral route administration, first day 4 x 1 tabl.) in patients with bronchial asthma has not caused significant decrease of the specific resistance (SRaw) of airways, (p value 0.1 > Alpha 0.05).   Antileukotriene - Zileuton administered 2 days in a row, in a dose of 600 mg (4 x a day 1 tabl.), has caused sig-nificant decrease of the specific resistance (SRaw) of air-ways (p value 0.03 < Alpha 0.05). Treatment of the control group with salbutamol (agonist of beta2-adrenergic recep-tor) is effective in removal of the increased bronchomo-tor tonus, by causing significant decrease of the resistance (Raw), namely specific resistance (SRaw), (p value 0.05 = Alpha 0.05).  This suggests that Zileuton is a powerful selective in-hibitor of the activity of 5-lypoxygenase and as such inhibits generation of its products. Consequently, besides inhibition of cys-LTs\u2019 formation, Zileuton also inhibits the formation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which is a powerful chemotactic of other eicosanoids too, which depend on the synthesis of lekotriene A4 (LTA4). According to gained results, the ef-fect of antileukotriene (Zileuton) is not immediate after oral administration, but the powerful effect of the Zileuton seen only after two days of inhibition of cys-LTs\u2019, and inhibition of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and A4 (LTA4) based on the re-cordings made of the specific resistance of airways (SRaw).ReferencesBarnes, N.C., Miller, C.J., 2000.

The endogenous ligand neuropeptide Substance P (SP) selectively binds to NK1 receptor at the plasma membrane (Munoz et al. 2011). SP is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin peptide family and widely distributed in both the central and the peripheral nervous system of mammals. Activation of NK1 receptor by SP stimulates G-protein mediated signaling pathways that are crucial for regulating cellular excitabil-ity and function such as cAMP accumulation, arachidon-ic acid mobilization and phosphatidylinositol turnover. It has been shown that activation of Akt suppresses apoptosis and stimulation of NK1 receptor by SP induces phosphory-lation on Akt or Protein Kinase B (PKB) activity in human glioblastoma cells. After binding to the NK1 receptor in tu-mor cells, SP induces mitogenesis and inhibits apoptosis. Hence NK1 receptor antagonists can lead to apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Antagonists of these recep-tors inhibit the development of metastasis by blocking the activation of NK1 receptor by SP. It is shown that NK1 re-ceptors are overexpressed in tumor cells and their antago-nists such as aprepitant, L-733,060, and L-732,138 have antitumor activity against several human cancer cell lines such as melanoma, neuroblastoma, glioma, retinoblasto-ma, pancreatic, larynx, gastric and colon carcinomas (Mu-noz et al. 2011). It has been demonstrated that binding sites of pep-tide antagonists and non-peptide antagonists of NK1recep-tor are different than each other. SP and peptide NK1 re-ceptor antagonists bind to the extracellular terminal region of the receptor, but non-peptide NK1 receptor antagonists bind to intracellular part of the enzyme between transmem-brane helices (Munoz et al. 2011). Ligand binding pock-et of an NK1 receptor is a hydrophobic core between the loops of transmembrane TM III-VII. Several residues, such as Gln165 (TM IV), His197 (TM V), His265 (TM VI) and Tyr287 (TM VII) are involved in the binding of many non-peptide antagonists of the NK1 receptor. The other resi-dues that are contributed in non-peptide antagonist binding are Ser169, Glu193, Lys194, Phe264, Phe267, Pro271 and Tyr272 (Almeida et al. 2004).Over the last decade our group have been designed, synthesized, and working on the new anticancer active compounds. Some of our previously synthesized benzoxa-zole and benzamide compounds showed significant inhib-itory activity for human DNA Topoisomerases and Gluta-thione S-transferases and also anticancer effects observed on various cell cultures (Pinar et al. 2004). In this research, we aimed to search the activity of our previously synthesized compound, 2-[4-(4-ethylbenzami-do)phenyl]benzothiazole (BSN009), to the new anticancer target NK1 receptor and to identify the binding site fea-tures and modes of NK1 receptor and the non-peptide an-tagonists including our synthesized compound using mo-lecular docking study.Materials and methodsThe cytotoxic activity of tested compounds (BSN009, CP-96345, L-733,060, L-732,138, and aprepitant) were as-sayed using the MTT colorimetric protocol. MTT is cleaved to formazan by the \u201csuccinate-tetrazolium reductase\u201d sys-tem (EC 1.3.99.1) which belongs to the mitochondrial re-spiratory chain and is active only in viable cells. Human S6 PP 264554Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 553 - 554 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationscolon carcinoma cell line HT-29 (ATCC, HTB-38), breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (ATCC, HTB-38), human cervi-cal carcinoma cell line HeLa (ATCC, CCL-2) and mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 (ATCC, CRL-1658) were used in this study for cytotoxicity experiments.To analyze the binding site features of the tested com-pounds the molecular docking studies were performed by using CDocker working with Accelrys Discovery Studio (DS) 3.5 software.The homology model of the NK1 receptor with CP-96345 was developed by Evers and Klebe. For prepara-tion of protein and ligands the target protein was taken, hy-drogens were added and their positions were optimized us-ing all atom CHARMm forcefield and the Powell method available in DS 3.5 protocol. The minimized protein was defined as the receptor using the binding site module. The binding site was defined from the cavity finding method which was modified to accommodate all the important in-teracting residues in non-peptide antagonist binding site of the NK1 receptor. The protein was held rigid while the li-gands were allowed to be flexible during refinement. The docking and scoring methodology was first validated by docking of ligand CP-96345. The docked position of CP-96345 overlaps well with the homology model position,Results and discussionOur previously synthesized compound, 2-[4-(4-ethyl-benzamido)phenyl]benzothiazole (BSN009) was found as an active compound at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM as a result of MTT assay and inhibited colon cancer cell lines growth about by 57.53%. On the other hand, it has also been found that  BSN-009 had no toxic effect on the normal cell line. As a result of the molecular docking studies; BSN-009 was shown similar binding modes with NK1 receptor as known antagonists L-733,060, aprepitant, and L-732,138. The tested 2-substituted benzothiazole, BSN009, has hy-drogen bonds with Gln165 (2,39 Angstrom) and His197 (1,83 Angstrom) like other non-peptide antagonists of NK1 receptor Oxygen atom of carbonyl group of BSN009 makes an H bond with His197. The phenyl ring of the ben-zamide group of BSN009 has a pi-cation interactions with His187. Binding energy values (kcal/mol-1) of BSN009 and aprepitant, which is a well-known NK1 receptor an-tagonist, is close to each other.ConclusionIn conclusion, the performed molecular docking study elucidated that Gln165, His197, His265 and Tyr287 are crucial amino acids in the non-peptide binding site of the NK1 receptor. As a result of the molecular docking study and cytotoxic experiments, it can be concluded that BSN009 may be a good anticancer drug candidate as an NK1 receptor antagonist and is worthy to carry on the an-ticancer in vivo studies. This study also provide a model to design novel and more potent antitumor agents as NK1 re-ceptor antagonists.ReferencesAlmeida, T.A., Rojo, J., Nieto, P.M., Pinto, F.M., Hernandez, M., Martin, J.D., Candenas, M.L., 2004.

Development of a new drug is connected with quantitative structure-activ-ity (properties) relationship, QSA(P)R, research. Lipohi-licity is the key physicochemical property of a molecule which depends on its structure and determines its phar-macokinetic behavior and biological activity. Due to its high cost-effectiveness and fair reproducibility, thin-lay-er chromatography (TLC) is one of important alternatives for quantifying lipophilicity of drug candidates. The aim of this study was to calculate hydrophobicity index C0 with reversed phase (RP) TLC methods of 14 compounds with assumed antiepileptic activity and to examine whether C0 values can be applied in QSA(P)R studies.Materials and methodsRP TLC was used for study of the retention behav-ior of N-(3- or 4- substituted phenyl)-2,2,-diphenyl-succin-imide derivatives. Substance number 1 (s1) is not substi-tuted, s2-s11 have attached in para position: -CH3, -OCH3, -OH, -NO2, -CN, -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -COCH3, while s12-s14 have in position meta -CN, -OH and -Cl, respectively. Pre-coated RP-18W/UV254 10\u00d710 cm plates (Macherey-Na-gel GmbH and Co., D\u00fcren, Germany) were used as sta-tionary phase and binary solutions of water with acetoni-trile with a varying volume fraction, \u03c6 (0.45-0.65) of or-ganic solvent, were the mobile phase. Each analyzed com-pound was dissolved in acetone (c=2mg/ml) and 0.2 \u00b5l al-iquots with a micropipette were spotted on the chromato-graphic plates. Ascending technique with previous satu-ration of the chambers was used. After development, the spots were detected at 254 nm with UV lamp and Rf val-ues were measured. For each compound analyzed in this paper, logP values (logarithm of the partition coefficient of the compound) and logD values (log of the distribution coefficient of the compound at pH=7.4) were determined by the usage of different algorithms (www.alogps.com and www.acdlabs.com). Physicochemical parameters as num-ber of rotatable bonds (RB), numbers of hydrogen bond donors (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), polar sur-face area (PSA) and molar weight (MW) were obtained, as well. Finally, for each compound ka (constant of absorp-tion in min-1) and logBB (logarithm of blood-brain barri-er, BBB permeability) were predicted (www.acdlabs.com). All calculations and statistical analysis were done by use of software package Origin 8.0.Results and discussionRetardation factor, RM was calculated for each com-pound according to the equation: RM=log(1/Rf-1). Further-more, in the linear correlation of the RM values versus \u03c6, the chromatographic retention constant RM0, was obtained as extrapolated value to 0% point: RM=RM0+S\u00d7\u03c6. The iso-cratic chromatographic hydrophobicity index, C0, is calcu-lated as RM0/S and it is defined as point when the amount of S6 PP 265556Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 555 - 556 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsthe analyte in the mobile and the stationary phase is equal. Since, C0 is usually applied for quantifying lipophilicity of the compound; it has been compared to the computer calculated logP values. Highly significant linear correla-tion with good correlation coefficients has been observed between the C0 values and in silico logP/logD values (r2=0.78, r2=0.94 and r2=0.77 for MlogP, ClogP and logD, respectvely) in which substance with OH group in posi-tion meta (s13) was an outlier. It has been assumed that s13 forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond since OH group as HBD is close to dione group which is HBA. Probably due to this kind of interactions, s13 has reduced affinity to form hydrogen bonds with water and to be eluted with the mo-bile phase when compared to its isomer, s4 which does not have possibility to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond.Regarding the physicochemical characteristics and re-lationship with \u201cdruglikness\u201d properties of the compounds investigated, according to Lipinski\u2019s rule of 5, poor absorp-tion or permeation are more likely for compounds which have >5 HBD, MW>500, logP>5 and >10 HBA. As previ-ously reported, none of the compounds violates even sin-gle rule. Moreover, additional rules for good oral bioavail-ability were proposed by Veber: \u226410 RB, \u2264140\u00c52 PSA, or \u226412 HBD+HBA. Analyzed compounds do not violate Ve-ber rules hence good oral absorption can be expected. Ac-cording to in silico data absorption rate is practically iden-tical for all the examined compounds (ka between 0.051 to 0.053 min-1). The main assumption is that the effect of the core consisted of three phenyl groups attached to suc-cinimide ring may overwhelm that of the substituent and slight changes in lipophilicity determined by C0 practi-cally do not affect their absorption rate. Physicochemical properties influence the passive BBB permeation of com-pounds. Set of BBB rules was compiled by Clark: N+O<6, PSA<60\u201370\u00c52, MW<450, logD=1\u20133, ClogP\u2013(N+O)>0 in order for the compound to permeate through BBB. All compounds violate one or two rules (high logD and/or PSA), while s5 violate four rules. Nitro group has defined positive and negative poles and it is partially ionized in-hibits BBB permeation of s5. Since BBB permeability de-pends on lipophilicity (Di et al., 2003), logBB was present-ed as function of C0 and square equation with good statis-tical quality (r2=0.658, p<0.001) was obtained.ConclusionFor the analyzed succinimide derivates, experimental-ly obtained C0 values are comparable to the in silico deter-mined logP/logD values with s13 excused from the com-parison. Retention parameter, C0 can be proposed for ex-pressing lipophilicity of the analytes examined in this pa-per and it can be applied in QSA(P)R studies.

The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) classifies CKD into five stages according to estimated glomerular filtration rate. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been usually estimated based on equation that incorporates serum creatinine concentration (SCR) along with demographic data and it is measured in ml/min per 1,73m2: the first stage has GFR >90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and the second one between 60-89 ml/min/1.73m2, while stages 3, 4 and 5 are being characterized with GFR 30-59, 15-29 or <15 ml/min/1.73m2, respectively.Based on CKD stage disease individualization of therapy is required especially for drugs which are mainly eliminated through urine and/or have narrow therapeutic index. Other conditions which may required individual dosage regimen are also: application of nefrotoxic drugs, conditions which may lead to development of chronic renal disease as hypertension, diabetes mellitus etc. Furthermore, severe hepatic dysfunction is usually accompanied by some renal impairment (hepato-renal syndrome). Reduced renal excretion has been reported in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child\u2013Pugh class C) for a number of drugs mainly eliminated by renal excretion in unchanged form. Calculated creatinine clearance (CLCR) based on serum creatinine concentration is the most convenient method to estimate GFR as it requires only a single blood sample. As serum creatinine is so highly dependent on age, gender, and body size, a number of formulas and corrections have been developed to estimate the muscle mass and assumed creatinine production (Verbeeck and Musuamba, 2009).One of the oldest method for GFR estimation in adults is Cockcroft-Gault formula: GFR(ml/min/1.73m2)=[140-age(y)\u00d7body weight(kg)]/SCR(mg/dL)\u00d772] multiplied with 0.85 if the patient is women. Estimated creatinine clearance may be calculated also based on Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulas. MDRD1 formula beside the concentration of creatinine in serum requires additional information as urea concentration in serum, Cu in mg/dL and albumin concentration in serum, alb in g/dL and it is given as: GFR=170\u00d7SCR exp(-0.999) \u00d7 age exp(-0.176) \u00d7 (0.762 for women) \u00d7 (1.180 for black) \u00d7 Cu exp(-0.170) \u00d7 alb exp(0.318). However, MRDR2 formula requires only serum concentration level i.e.: GFR=186\u00d7SCR exp(-1.154)\u00d7age exp(-0.203)\u00d7(0.742 for women)\u00d7(1.212 for black). Moreover, for patients whose GFR is over 60 ml/min/1.73m2 it may be calculated by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation which is considered to give more precise estimation: GFR=a\u00d7[SCR(mg/dL))exp(c)/b]\u00d7[0.993 exp(age)] where a is for white race 141 for male and 144 for female, and in the black race 163 for male and 166 for female, b is 0.9 for male and 0.7 for female and while c is -0.411 if serum creatinine levels is <0.9 mg/dL and -1.209 if serum creatinine levels is >0.9 mg/dL in male or -0.329 if SCR is <0.7 mg/dL and -1.209 if SCR levels is >0.7 mg/dL in female. If the patient is overweight/obese (BMI >25 kg/m2 according to WHO), Salazar-Corcoran method should be used: GFR is estimated as GFR=[(137-age)\u00d7(0.285\u00d7body weight(kg)]+12.1\u00d7height(m)\u00d7height(m)]/[51\u00d7SCR(mg/dL)] in male while in female patients the estimation is given as GFR=[(146-age)\u00d7(0.287\u00d7body weight(kg)]+9.74\u00d7height(m)\u00d7height(m)]/[60\u00d7SCR(mg/dL)]. In children, Schwartz adjusted method is used for estimation of renal impairment degree i.e.: GFR=[k\u00d7height(cm)]/SCR(mg/dL) where k=0.33 for pre-term newborns age under 1 year, k=0.45 for full term in-S6 PP 266558Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 557 - 558 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsfants age<1, k=0.55 for children age 1-12 and girls in pu-berty and 0.7 for boys in puberty (age >12). If the children are obese, L\u00e9ger (L\u00e9ger et al., 2002) formula is being ap-plied: GFR=[56.7\u00d7body weight(kg)+0.142\u00d7height(cm)\u00d7height(cm)]/[88.4\u00d7SCR(mg/dL)]. GFR can alternatively be calculated based on the serum concentration of cystatin C. Cystatin C, is a small, nonglycosylated basic protein, produced at a constant rate which renal elimination occurs only by glomerular filtration with no tubular secretion, and only minimal extrarenal elimination. The blood concentration of cystatin C depends almost entirely on the GFR and is not substantially affected by diet, nutritional status, or inflammatory or malignant diseases. If cystatin C is being determined by PENIA method GFR can be estimated as: GFR=80.35\u00d7cystatin C(mg/L)-4.32, while if it is determined by PETIA method GFR should be calculated as GFR=86.49\u00d7cystatine C(mg/L)-1.68(\u00d71.384 for children <14) (Chew et al., 2008). Once the GFR is determined, individual dosage regimen in patient with chronic kidney disease can be applied based on the following formula: D*=D\u00d7Q where D is the maintenance dose for patient with normal renal function, D* is maintenance dose for patient with renal impairment and Q is being calculated as Q= fnonr + fr\u00d7(CLCR*/CLCR) i.e. Q=(1-fr) + fr\u00d7(CLCR*/CLCR) where CLCR is clearance creatinine in patient with normal renal function and CLCR* is the calculated clearance creatinine for the patient who requires individual dosage regimen, fr is the fraction of drug eliminated by urine and fnonr is the drug fraction eliminated extrarenal. The normal range of GFR, adjusted for body surface area, is 100-130 ml/min/1.73m2 in men and 90-120 ml/min/1.73m2 in women younger than the age of 40 and in pharmacokinetic calculations for CLCR it is usually used 100 ml/min/1.73m2. In children, GFR is 110 ml/min/1.73m2 until 2 years of age in both sexes, and then it progressively decreases. Hence when new dose is being calculated in patient with renal impairment and in comparison with ones who have normal renal function CLCR=110 ml/min/1.73m2 is being used for children under the age of 2 and 100 ml/min/1.73m2 for older (Doogue and Polasek, 2011).ReferencesChew, J.C., Saleem, M., Florkowski, C.M., George, P.M., 2008.

G. Bonchev 9, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria* lulzime.ballazhi@unite.edu.mkIntroductionIt has been known for many years that coumarins have versatile structure, significant therapeutic potential and are present in many natural therapeutic products (Riveiro et al., 2010). They have multiple biological activities, including anticoagulant (Mousa, 2002), anti-inflammatory (Hadjipavlou-Litina et al., 2007), antimicrobial (Nimavat et al., 2009) and anticancer activities (Belluti et al, 2010). In search for new chemotherapeutics against based on coumarin we have synthesized eight compounds that combine coumarin core and izoxazoles or thiazoles in hydrazinyldiene-chroman-2,4-diones (Jashari et al., 2014; Ballazhi et al., 2014; 2015). Three of the eight compounds, 3-[2-(1,3-thiazol-2-yl)hydrazinylidene]chroman-2,4-dione (1), 3-[2-(4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)hydrazinylidene]chroman-2,4-dione (2) and 3-[2-(4,5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)hydrazinylidene]chroman-2,4-dione (3), have been shown to have most potent antiproliferative effects and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Jashari et al., 2014) and bone and lung metastatic cell lines from breast cancer (Ballazhi et al., 2015). In addition, synergistic effects of tamoxifen (Ballazhi et al., 2014) and doxorubicin (Ballazhi et al., 2016, submitted for publication) with these compounds were evaluated and apoptotic effect was confirmed. These compounds were further subjected to physicochemical characterization. In this study their distribution coefficients (logD) in three pH environments were evaluated and compared with the anticipated ones from different software packages. Materials and methods4-Hydroxycoumarine (4-HC, reference), n-octanol and the compounds for preparation of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), NaH2PO4, NaOH and KH2PO4, were purchased from Merck KgaA (Germany). The tested compounds were synthesized by the procedure previously described (Jashari et al., 2014; Ballazhi et al., 2015). The experimentally obtained distribution coefficients (logDexp) between n-octanol and phosphate buffers (pH 7.4, NaH2PO4-NaOH, 0.15 M, I = 0.397 M; pH 6.8, NaH2PO4-NaOH, 0.15 M, I = 0.397 M; and pH 5.8, Na2HPO4-KH2PO4-NaOH, 0.15 M, I = 0.6, temp. coef. -0.0028/oC) were determined by shake-flask method (Ballazhi et al., 2016, submitted for publication). The experiments were performed in the systems n-octanol : PBS = 2:1; 1:1; 1:2 (vol), in triplicate. The mixtures of the organic and aqueous phase containing the compounds were shaken on a mechanical shaker for 2 h (shake-water bath, Haake, 25\u00b10.1 oC). After equilibration, they were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm, the n-octanol phase was removed and in both phases the concentrations of the compounds were assayed spectrophotometrically (UV/VIS Perkin-Elmer System, USA) at \u03bbmax 290 nm for 4-HC and 410-420 nm for the tested compounds. The logDexp were calculated as the ratio between molar S6 PP 267560Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 559 - 560 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsconcentration in n-octanol and aqueous phase. All experiments were made in triplicate. The logD7.4exp values were compared with the calculated ones (logDcalc) obtained by ChemAxon\u2019s software (www.chemicalize.org/), Vega NIC (www.vegaNIC.com), ChemDraw (www.cemistry-software.com), vcclab (www.vcclab.org)-ALOGPS 2.1 and molinspiration (www.molinspiration.com). Results and discussionThe logD7.4exp, logD6.8exp and logD5.8exp values de-termined for monobasic acid 4-HC were in accordance with the literature data as well as the partition coefficient of the un-dissociated 4-HC in pH 7.4, logP 2.66, which is similar to the value 2.37 determined by van der Gies-sen and Janssen (1982). When n-octanol/PBS ratio was 1:1, the logD7.4exp ranged between -0.065\u00b10.003 (1) and 0.957\u00b10.038 (3), logD6.8 between 0.153\u00b10.001 (1) and 0.996\u00b10.008 (3) and logD5.8 between 0.894\u00b10.011 (1) and 1.886\u00b10.018 (3). Small differences and the same tenden-cy were observed between the corresponding logDexp when determined in systems with different n-octanol/PBS ra-tios. Large discrepancy was noted between logD7.4exp and logD7.4calc values. However, when a simple regression was performed, there was found a strong correlation between the logD7.4exp and logD7.4calc (0.986\u2264R\u22640.999). Depend-ing on the software used, predictions are composed of the molecules\u2019 atomic increments, selected atom types to ac-commodate electron delocalization and addition of con-tributions of ionic forms. logD of zwitterions is calcu-lated from the logD at the pI. Also, the effect of hydro-gen bonds on logD is considered if the formation of a six membered ring between suitable donor and acceptor at-oms can take place. As the logD values are pH-dependent, the logD calculation relies on the pKa prediction process. Considering data determined in the study, the smallest difference was observed when software package VegaN-ic was applied (1.189\u2264\u0394(logD7.4calc-logD7.4exp)\u22641.527 for 4-HC; 0.682\u2264\u0394(logD7.4calc-logD7.4exp)\u22641.096 for 1; 0.814\u2264\u0394(logD7.4calc-logD7.4exp)\u22641.393 for 2; 1.075\u2264\u0394(logD7.4calc-logD7.4exp)\u22641.488 for 3), which is based on two well-known molecular descriptors: ALogP (hydrophobicity contribution of 120 atom types) and MlogP (13 structural parameters). The large discrep-ancy between the predicted and experimentally determined values suggests that the structures of the coumarin deriva-tives in the aqueous phase and/or in the organic phase are significantly different from the assuming structures. One of the reasons could be the tautomeric behavior of these compounds.ConclusionDistribution coefficients of novel coumarin derivatives in different pH mediums were determined.  The derivative having thiazole moiety with additional methyl groups attached to the carbons at the positions 4 and 5 (3) showed the highest lipophylicity. Further studies are needed for complete physico-chemical and PK/PD characterization of the synthesized compounds.

Macedonia* magivrckovska@yahoo.comIntroductionSystematic lupus erithematosus (SLE) is multi siste-matic autoimmune disease with wide range of clinical symptoms on almost every organ and tissue, with a high level of morbidity and mortality as a result. There is no clear cause for SLE and is hard to be cured (Bertsias et al., 2012).In recent years, with increasing levels of health care, there are new drugs to treat SLE. Although the survival rate from 1990 till today has increased by 68% (Urowitz and Gladman, 2000) due to the use of glucocorticoids and cy-totoxic drugs, excessive use of these drugs leads to many side effects and death cases. Also, significant concerns re-lated to opportunistic infections and secondary malignancy due to immunosuppressive treatments emerge the need for safer and more effective therapy. In recent decades, stem cell transplantation has emerged as a new treatment mo-dality for refractory and severe SLE, mainly hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and mesenchymal stem cell transplantation (MSCT). The study of Liang and Sun (2015) is related to the rationale and current status of the MSCT in the treatment of SLE.SLE therapy If the HSC defects are from aquired response, auto-logus HSCT can be a treatable method after removing the cause of risk, and making reconstruction of the immune system with deleting the auto-reactive lymphocyte clone of hematopoietic origin. No matter of any of this, if genet-ics is a dominant factor, allogenetic HSCT will be more ef-fective and logically applicative approach (Liang and Sun, 2015). In the most cases, patients are treated with an alloge-netic HSCT for SLE and concominant hematological dis-eases, and will have complete remission from the first and second conditions. But, beside the encouraging result, there might be some problems with HSCT treatment in SLE (Kushida et al., 2001). Allogenetic HSCT seems to have a huge curative po-tential, but also, comes with enormous risk of GVHD (graft versus host disease) that have high occurrence and hold responsibility for worst results of allogenetic trans-plantation in hematologic disease, with limitation of wider consideration of in autoimmune disease. GVHD are linked with some symptoms, like acute organ toxicity, delayed re-constitution of immune system, increase TRM (transplan-tation-related mortality), longer remaining of autoreactive lymphocytes, and high rate of opportunistic infections. As a conclusion of above written, autologus and allogenetic HSCT can\u2019t be considered as best stem cell therapy (Bert-sias et al., 2012).In recent days, MSCT is new, hopeful stem cell thera-py for SLE. Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent, non-hematopoietic cells that are being considered as a promis-ing new treatment for tissue regeneration. It has demon-strated that mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into bone and cartilage, and have immunomodulatory effects on T-cells and B-cells. They also can\u2019t be detected by the im-mune system because they lack co-stimulatory molecules.Combination of anti-proliferative and immunomod-ulatory characteristics of MSCs and their immunological privilege will make a new approach in treatment of variety of autoimmune inflammatory diseases. By today, MSCs are used in cases with multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis op-tica, chronic and acute GVHD.S6 PP 268562Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 561 - 562 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsCombinations of MSC deficiency and SLE began with making some experiments. Transplantation of allogeneic HSCs with bones to get MSCs is a path for prevention of the recurrence of autoimmune diseases in MRL/lpr mice, a murine model of lupus, in cases of easy relapse if HSCs are infused alone. Also, a positive response is found in trans-plantation with allogeneic HSCs and MSCs namely it in-creased survival level of MRL/lpr mice, but also with bone marrow transplantation (Ishida et al., 1994).The named above results stress deficiency in lupus MSC populations and gave a strong impact for greater use of MSCT in lupus treatment, it is hard to see abnormality is from genetic or acquired factors is alike. This problem is very important in HSCT also, because it will determine the best and appropriate source for MSCT, or it would be au-tologous or allogeneic.The first study of MSC infusions in humans is the one from 1995, which demonstrates the appropriance of ex vivo expansion and subsequent infusion of autologous MSCs in 15 patient volunteers. From that point, MSCT was consid-ered as a great tool in the usage of engraftment, manage-ment graft failure, prevention or treatment of GVHD after HSCT, and treatment of several other autoimmune diseas-es (Liang et al., 2010).The most important result of human MSC therapy is arising from clinical trials which have an aim of severe and refractory SLE patient, even with mechanisms with which MSCs conduct their functions of immune modulation and are still not completely understood, but will involve vari-ety of paths. Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital (ADTH) of Nanjing University Medical School is the very first sec-tion involved in in MSCT for treatment of autoimmune disease. More than 300 patients with active and persistent SLE, refractory to standard treatment, was under treatment with allogeneic MSCT. The treatment was due from March 2007 through December 2013. Four patients had a great improvement in creatinine levels in serum. Anti-dsDNA titers decreased after 1 month post-MSCT in all cases. All patients could lower the doses of steroids and CTX, and also there were two cases where patients weren\u2019t taking CTX anymore after 6 months re-sults. There was no GVHD and TRM after allogenetic MSCT (Liang et al., 2010). Results clearly show that MSCs have large therapeu-tic potential but also have many problems that have to be solved for making way for MSCT to treatment of lupus. One of the problems is getting standard cell production without considering heterogeneity, potential, influence of expansion media on the phenotype, and suitability of the source. Some factors possible change capability of expan-sion, potency and phenotype, like age of donor and condi-tion of growth, for even the surface makers of MSCs (Li-ang and Sun, 2015). Lupus is a mesenchymal stem cell disease, not only hematopoietic, in light of defects in HSCs and also MSCs in SLE patients. At recent days risks of GVHD are limited in great range for the clinical use of allogenetic. Howev-er, allogenetic MSCT will be better and more attractive to use then the allogenetic HSCT in treatment of lupus, with preliminary results in efficacy and safety. This will make a new platform in treatment of SLE patients with refractory and severe disease (Liang and Sun, 2015).ConclusionThe number of patients with SLE in our country is higher to date and unfortunately in Macedonia, doctors use conventional therapy in treatment of SLE. That arise a need for implementation of the latest method in treatment of SLE with aim to improve the quality of life. Also, the number of hospital days will be lower, as well as the need of cure in countries abroad, and costs for medicines. The most important result will be improved quality of patinets` life, where people will have longer life and lower rate of mortality. For that cause, we should promote implementing conditions where this treatment will be in use, with simpli-fying and making life better for SLE patinets.

Due to an amphiphathic structure, bile acids have been recognized to facilitate a transport of various substances across biological membranes, influencing their physiological and pharmacological activity (Stojan\u010devi\u0107 et al., 2013). During the past fifteen years bile acids were endowed with a hormone function since these steroid molecule species regulate numerous metabolic processes, determine metabolism and cell fate not only in enterohepatic tissues, but also on a systemic level (Stanimirov et al., 2015). In addition, bile acids and bile acid-activated receptors play a profound role in the process of carcinogenesis; however, this function has not been clearly elucidated jet. All of these peculiar functions are mediated by the interaction of bile acids with several proteins including nuclear and G-protein-coupled receptors as well as cell kinase pathways (Stanimirov et al., 2012). This raises the complexity of bile acid functions on a novel level, emphasizing their role not only as a passive carrier that promotes transport of pharmacological agents across biological membranes, but also as the agents with potential pharmacodynamic function. Doxorubicin is one of the most potent and most commonly used antineoplastic agents for the treatment of both solid and hematological malignancies. Doxorubicin induces the programmed cell death in malignant cell through several pathways, including the DNA strand breaks by topoisomerase 2\u03b1 inhibition, DNA alkylation, oxidative stress and oxidative damage of nucleic acids, proteins and lipid membranes, ATP depletion etc. However, cumulative, dose-dependent toxicity of this agent may result in hepatotoxic and cardiotoxic events which cast shadow on the quality of life of oncological survivors. Therefore, the enhancement of doxorubicin function along with reducing dose-dependent undesirable effects is one of the main challenges in developing novel doxorubicin formulations. The aim of this study was to determine an effect of secondary bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, on the cytotoxic activity and proapoptotic potential of doxorubicin in vitro, in a model of human breast adenocarcinoma.Materials and methodsHuman breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of doxorubicin and ursodeoxycholic acid, and the cytotoxic activity was assessed using colorimetric MTT test. Cells were also simultaneously treated with selected concentration of doxorubicin and the concentration of ursodeoxycholic acid within the range of physiological level. The quantitative analysis of expression of genes involved in apoptosis, Bax and Bcl-2, was assessed using real-time quantitative PCR method. Gene expression was calculated using \u0394\u0394Ct method for relative quantification and normalized to \u03b2-actin as a housekeeping gene. The statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance with SPSS statistical software and if the p \u2264 0.05the results were considered as significant.Results and discussionBoth doxorubicin and ursodeoxycholic acid expressed dose-dependent cytotoxic activity with half inhibitory S6 PP 269564Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 563 - 564 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsconcentration (IC50) values of 0.64 \u03bcM and 320.5 \u03bcM, respectively. When the cells were co-treated with 0.25 \u03bcM of doxorubicin and non toxic concentration of ursodeoxycholic acid, the cytotoxicity increased up to 39.6% (p \u2264 0.05), compared to doxorubicin alone which inhibited 33% of cell growth. This result indicates that the addition of ursodeoxycholic acid may significantly increase doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cell line. In the following step we wanted to dissect the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by determining the expression of apoptosis-related genes Bax and Bcl-2. The expression of a pro-apoptotic gene Bax in cells treated with doxorubicin alone was 3.22 fold higher (p < 0.01), and in the group of cells co-treated with doxorubicin and ursodeoxycholic acid was 2.28 fold higher in comparison with control group (p < 0.01). The expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 in the doxorubicin treated cells was 1.42 fold higher (p < 0.01), whereas in co-treated cells was 1.25 fold decreased compared to the control (p < 0.01). These results indicate that co-treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid reduced the expression of both apoptosis-related genes compared to cells treated with doxorubicin alone, which is in agreement with well known antioxidant and apoptosis-reducing function of ursodeoxycholic acid (Perez and Briz, 2009). When we assessed the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, a parameter that determines the susceptibility of cells to the apoptosis, the values of this ratio in doxorubicin treated cells was highly significantly increased in both doxorubicin-treated and ursodeoxycholic acid-co-treated cells, 6.26 \u00b1 0.7 (p < 0.01) and 7.89 \u00b1 1.1 (p < 0.01), respectively, compared to control group of cells 2.9 \u00b1 0.9. Even though the value of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the group of co-treated cells was higher compared to doxorubicin treated cells, the difference was not statistically significant. However, the results were in accordance with the results of MTT test indicating that the co-treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid had driven MCF-7 cells into apoptosis in greater extent than treatment with doxorubicin alone.ConclusionThe simultaneous treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid in non-toxic concentrations and doxorubicin significantly increased the cytotoxicity towards MCF-7 cell line, by promoting the programmed cell death, apoptosis, at least on the transcriptomic level. Therefore, ursodeoxycholic acid may be exploited as useful agent in developing novel pharmaceutical formulations or antineoplastic strategies relying on doxorubicin protocol.AcknowledgmentSupported by the Ministry of education, science and technological development, the Republic of Serbia, Grant III41012.ReferencesPerez, M.J., Briz, O., 2009.

The effect of bile acids on drug transporters is currently a challenging topic due to consequences on efficacy and safety profiles of drugs. Research on this topic has been mostly restricted to the impact of bile acids on the eukaryotic drug transporters what is confirmed by several studies (Yang et al., 2011). Up to date there has been no study on bile acids interactions with multidrug transporters in probiotic bacteria. Given that bile acids interact with intestinal microbiota as significant drug-metabolizing system that may be the cause of inter- and intra- individual differences in drug metabolism (Stojancevic et al., 2014) the purpose of this study was to use computational servers and softwares to assess the binding affinities of different bile acids towards bacterial multidrug transporters and to propose the mechanism of their influence on drug transport through bacterial membrane (Djanic et al., 2016b). Materials and methodsAs a representative of gut microflora, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (LA) is chosen, as the most commonly commercially used probiotic bacterial strains and also abundant part of gut microflora. Docking study was carried out to estimate the binding affinities of three different bile acids: cholic acid (CA), 12-monoketocholic acid (MKC) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) to drug membrane transporters in LA. Docking step was performed using molecular docking program SwissDock web service which uses calculations performed in the CHARMM force field with EADock DSS. The lower estimated free energy of binding indicates the higher binding affinity. The list of multidrug transporters for LA was obtained from relational database \u2013 TransportDB, The amino acid sequence of all studied transport proteins were obtained from NCBI database in FASTA format. The 3D structures of proteins were predicted by I-TASSER server (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement). The obtained 3D structures are given a confidence score (c-score) which was in the range of [-5, 2] where a higher value indicates a model with a more reliable structure and vice-versa. Proteins with c-score below -1.5 were not taken into further consideration and were not analyzed in docking studies. 3D structures of CA and DCA in mol2 format were obtained from ZINC database. Structure of MKC was drawn in ACD/ChemSketch, a freeware for chemical structure drawing and subsequent optimization from ACD Labs.Results and discussionAccording to data available at TransportDB database, the total number of multidrug transport proteins in LA was 30, 14 from ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily and 16 from secondary transporters. The majority of predicted S6 PP 270566Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 565 - 566 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentations3D structures had a high confidence score reflecting the reliability of the obtained structures. Four proteins did not fulfill these criteria and were not further analyzed in docking studies. In other words, 26 transporters were included in docking studies. The molecular docking results revealed that studied bile acids exhibit different binding affinities towards multidrug transporters in LA. The lowest binding energy for the majority of examined transporters was estimated for MKC. Namely, from all 26 examined transport proteins, 13 (50%) gave the lowest binding energy in combination with MKC. The most prominent effect of MKC was observed in the cases of LBA1821 from ATP family and LBA0753 from the family of secondary transporters. Analyzing docking results, the second ranked bile acid was CA that gave the lowest docking result with 7 of 26 (26.9%) transporters. The most notable differences in docking score, regarding the CA was estimated for LBA0575, ABC transporter in LB. For only 6 transporters (23.0%), DCA was estimated to have the highest affinity compared to other examined bile acids. This is the most expressed in the case of LBA0552, secondary transporter. The correlation between hydrogen bond interactions and estimated free binding energies for all studied transport proteins revealed weak inverse relationship between the variables. Based on the calculated Pearson\u2019s coefficient, it may be concluded that, in addition to the hydrogen-bond interactions, the hydrophobic interactions also contribute to the stability of analyzed complexes. ConclusionThe molecular docking results presented in this study revealed that studied bile acids exhibit different binding affinities towards multidrug transporters in LA that may be the consequence of different chemical structures. The greatest effect of MKC for the majority of studied transport proteins suggests that keto group at the position 12 has a significant influence on the properties of MKC and consequently, on the interactions with membrane transporters. These findings might have a role in the prediction of bile acids and probiotics influence on drug pharmacokinetics. Computational techniques are expected to increase its contribution to structural pharmacology investigation of membrane transporters and their implication in drug metabolism. However, in order to confirm the predictive strength of these computationally obtained results, further in vitro and in vivo experimental validation is highly recommended.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia, Grant No. 41012.ReferencesDjanic, M., Pavlovic, N., Stanimirov, B., Vukmirovic, S., Nikolic, K., Agbaba, D., Mikov, M., 2016a.

The ob-jective of TDM is to evaluate the drug concentration in or-der to maximize the pharmacotherapeutic effects and min-imize the toxic effects (Gross, 2001). Several countries developed a specific service dealing with the therapeutic monitoring of drugs. In other countries this service is pro-vided by the pharmaceutic department, clinical pharmacy department, or the clinical biochemistry department (Mur-phy et al., 2007).The Therapeutic Monitoring of drugs is considered as a helpful instrument in case of drugs with a narrow ther-apeutic index, drugs highly bound to the proteins, drugs with high potential of interactions ecc. There are many fac-tors influencing the therapeutic drug monitoring such as diseases, non-compliance, habits, sampling time ecc. How-ever it is possible to retroactively evaluate the appropriate-ness of the interventions undertaken through the results ob-tained from monitoring of the serum drug levels (Burton et al., 2006).Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug presenting a narrow therapeutic range and a complicated pharmacoki-netics, thus representing a candidate drug to undergo ther-apeutic monitoring (Levy et al., 2002; Neels et al., 2004).The objective of this study was to evaluate the appro-priateness of the interventions through the therapeutic car-bamazepine monitoring in the neurology service in the University Hospital Mother Teresa in Tirana.Materials and methodsThe medical records regarding the monitoring of the serum levels for carbamazepine over 6 years (2008-2010 and 2013-2015) were evaluated. Data analyses were per-formed using Chi square test. Information was received from the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory and the Neurol-ogy Service in the University Hospital Mother Teresa in Tirana. Results and discussionWe analyzed all medical records for patients who un-derwent the measurement of the serum level of carbamaze-pine for two separated periods: 2008-2010 and 2013-2015. All these requests for the measurement of carbamazepine serum level were performed by neurologists in order to identify whether the missing therapeutic effect or the pres-ence of toxicity was dedicated to the abnormal serum lev-el of the drug. The overall number of carbamazepine mea-surements in the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory was for the years 2008-2010 respectively 286, 249 and 227; and for the years 2013-2015 the measurements were 34, 49 and 51 respectively. All measurements were performed through immunoassay methods. Standard dose regimens for car-bamazepine resulted in insufficient serum concentration in 37% of the cases for the measurements performed in the years 2008-2010 and in 23% of the cases for the measure-S6 PP 271568Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 567 - 568 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsments performed in the years 2013-2015.  Standard dose regimens for carbamazepine resulted in overdose concen-trations in 34% of the cases for the measurements per-formed in the years 2008-2010 and in 21% of the cases for the measurements performed in the years 2013-2015. Cli-nicians\u2019 response to the abnormal concentrations of carba-mazepine were appropriate in 65% of the interventions in the first 3 years and this appropriateness raised to 98% in the second three years of evaluation (p<0.01).A limitation of our study consists in the evaluation of restricted information. It would be helpful if we could an-alyze also the factors leading to the abnormal serum lev-els of carbamazepine, the concomitant therapies which pa-tients were taking at the time of serum level measurement.Our study demonstrated better therapeutic outcomes after evaluation of the first period of TDM application on carbamazepine levels. This finding is in accordance with similar studies where better results were obtained after crit-ical evaluation of the experience gathered (Patsalos et al., 2008; Shakya et al., 2008).The evaluation of the therapeutic interventions through the therapeutic monitoring of carbamazepine showed that the experience gained over the first three years\u2019 experi-ence with this evaluation brought to the better understand-ing of the real need to perform the therapeutic monitoring of carbamazepine. This led to a significant cost contain-ment in performing this evaluation. The cost of the thera-peutic monitoring procedures has been a continuous con-cern of the TDM service worldwide. Several studies have shown the benefits both in terms of therapeutic benefit for the patient and of economic benefit due to the implementa-tion of the therapeutic drug monitoring for different drugs. By the other hand there are other groups of drugs which do not need to undergo continuous therapeutic drug monitor-ing (Eadie, 1995). The therapeutic drug monitoring is applied in Albania through the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory within the University Hospital, since there is not yet in place e specif-ic service dealing with therapeutic monitoring of drugs. A future challenge for the therapeutic drug monitoring in Al-bania represents the inclusion of the clinical pharmacists in this process. It has been demonstrated through several studies that the pharmacists can play a critical role as part of the multidisciplinary team driving the TDM process as they have the skills and knowledge to resolve drug therapy problems (Ratanajamit et al., 2009; Steinman et al., 2011). The combination of different health professionals involved in the therapeutic drug monitoring process, together with the recent technology developments, facilitates new appli-cations in this field (Eliason, 2013).ConclusionThe service of therapeutic drug monitoring can pro-vide important information about the appropriateness of the clinical prescriptions and can therefore influence the outcomes of the drug therapy. The continuous evaluation of the medical interventions through the therapeutic drug monitoring interventions can improve the drug therapy re-sulting in better outcomes for the patient and in cost con-tainment. The involvement of the clinical pharmacist in the multidisciplinary team can improve the performance of the therapeutic drug monitoring service.ReferencesBurton, M.E., Shaw, L.M., Schentag, J.J., Evans, W.E., 2006.

However, despite its clinical efficacy, great variability in clinical response ex-ists. Much attention is paid to the genetic factors affecting inter-individual differences in clinical response and sever-al studies in this area point to single nucleotide polymor-phisms (SNPs) in the gene SLCO1B1 encoding multiple organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). As a membrane influx transporter, OATP1B1 regulates the cellular/hepatic uptake of a number of endogenous com-pounds and drugs, incl. atorvastatin (Giannakopoulou et al., 2014; Rodrigues et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011). Hence, SLCO1B1 SNPs are attractive targets for analyzing their influence on statin differential response (Giannakopoulou et al., 2014). SNPs 521T>C (*5, rs4149056) and 388A>G (*1b, rs2306283) that encode alanine substitution of valine at amino acid 174 (p.Val174Ala) and amino acid change at position 130 (p.Asn130Asp), respectively, are considered as the most prevalent SLCO1B1 variants relevant for the variability of drug response. c.388A>G variant has been associated with increased OATP1B1 transport activity of several substrate drugs in vitro (He et al., 2011), unlike c.521T>C variant for which reduced transport activity in vitro and increased plasma concentrations of several sub-strate drugs in the human body were observed (Kalliokos-ki et al., 2010). The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of SLCO1B1 c.521T>C and c.388A>G variants on the lipid lowering effect of atorvastatin in a sample of Albanian population.Materials and methodsSubjects and study design Briefly, 64 adults (53% males, av. age 58 yrs. and BMI 28) with primary hypercholesterolemia, all of Albanian or-igin participated in the study. All the participants used ator-vastatin once daily in a dose range of 10-80 mg. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Note for Guidance on GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95). The final clinical trial proto-col as well as the informed consent and other information that required pre-approval were reviewed and approved by the Independent Ethics Committee according to the appli-cable regulations.MethodsThe genotyping of SLCO1B1 521T>C and 388A>G was performed at the UKIM-Center for biomolecular phar-maceutical analyses, using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay (\u0422\u0430qMan\u00ae Drug Metabolizing Assay; Applied Bio-systems, Foster City, California, USA). Polymerase chain S6 PP 272570Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 569 - 570 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsreaction was performed on the Real-Time PCR system Mx3005P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) using TaqMan genotyping protocols (TaqMan\u00aeDrug Metabolizing assay; Applied Biosystems Foster City, Ca, USA) in total volume of 12.5 \u03bcL under the following conditions: one cycle of 2 min at 50 \u00baC, one cycle of 10 min at 95 \u00baC, and 50 cycles of 15 sec at 92 \u00baC and 1 min at 60 \u00baC. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apo-lipoprotein A (ApoA) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) were measured at beginning and after 3 months of treatment by standard accredited methods. All data were statistically an-alyzed using different statistical methods (independent t-test, Mann-Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis tests and Bonfer-roni correction, with 95%CI, IBM SPSS 19.0). Chi-square test was used to deduce deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The results were considered statistically sig-nificant at p<0.05.Results and discussionThe frequencies of the SLCO1B1 521T>C and 388A>G variant alleles were found to be 11% and 41%, respectively. However, no carrier of c.521CC was identi-fied. These frequencies were found to be similar to those observed in Macedonians (14.1% and 40%) (Daka et al., 2015) and Caucasians (15% and 37%) (Mwinyi et al., 2004). The observed frequency distributions did not show significant deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibri-um. Three-month treatment with atorvastatin significantly decreased the plasma levels of TC, LDL-C, TG and ApoB and increased the average values of HDL-C and ApoAI to the referent values. However, no statistically significant change in the levels of Lp(a) was observed and this pa-rameter remained out of referent range (\u226530 mg/dL; per-cent change -8.23\u00b115.16%). In the carriers of c.521TC (n=14), higher decrease in the levels of TC, TG and Lp(a) (11%, 15% and 26%, accordingly) was observed in com-parison with the c.521TT carriers (n=50), pointing to low-er activity of OATP1B1 in the carriers of variant c.521-allel. This could be confirmed by the percent changes in the levels of HDL-C and ApoAI in different c.521 geno-types of this ethnic group. Namely, after 3-month treat-ment, the average percent change of HDL-C was lower in c.521TC carriers (7.46\u00b19.66%) vs. higher average percent change of 15.96\u00b193.68% in c.521TT carrier (53% low-er increase). Similarly, the highest increase in the average percent change of ApoAI was observed in the carriers of c.521TT, 12.13\u00b112.27% vs. 4.32\u00b117.09% in the carriers of c.521TC (181% higher increase). No effect on the mean percentage changes of all these parameters after 3-month treatment with atorvastatin was observed among carriers of different SLCO1B1 c388A>G genotypes. These results are consistent with the findings from several studies con-ducted in the European (Giannakopoulou et al. 2014), Bra-zilian (Rodrigues et al., 2010) and Chinese population (Fu et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2010), where atorvastatin, simvas-tatin and pitavastatin as drugs were administered.ConclusionNo significant association between different SL-CO1B1 c.388A> G genotypes and atorvastatin response was observed in the studied Albanian population. Visible differences were observed between c.521TC and c.521TT carries, suggesting association between the c.521T>C SNP and atorvastatin response. Additional studies, with a large sample size, are needed to confirm statistical significance of this finding.ReferencesDaka Grapci, A., Dimovski, J.A., Kapedanovska, A., Vavlukis, M., Eftimov, A., Matevska Geshkovska, N., Labachevski, N., Jakjovski, H., Gorani., D., Kedev, S., Mladenovska, K., 2015.

GSTs are found in almost all organisms from mammals to plants and even in some prokaryotes. Human GSTs consist of three families: cytosolic GSTs, mitochon-drial GSTs, and microsomal GSTs. In mammalian cells cytosolic GSTs are further categorized into seven major classes according to their amino acid sequence: alpha, mu, pi, theta, zeta, omega, and sigma subfamilies, which have been identified in dimeric forms (Mathew et al., 2006).For the GST-mediated detoxification reactions, a sub-strate/GSH conjugation (complex formation) is required. GSTs are a family of Phase II detoxification enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of the GSH to a wide variety of electrophilic compounds. GSTs catalyze the conjugation of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) to electrophilic centers of endogenous and exogenous hydrophobic com-pounds. For GST-mediated catalytic reactions, the activa-tion of the sulfur atom of the G site bound GSH to the thio-late anion, which is a strong nucleophile, is required in or-der to perform a GS-substrate conjugate by attacking to the electrophilic center of substrates bound to the H site. Fur-thermore, the GS-conjugated compounds may be actively extruded from the cell through specialized pumps; princi-pally, the multidrug resistance proteins MRP-1 and MRP-2 (Wu and Dong, 2012).Human glutathione-S-transferase pi1-1 (hGST P1-1) is a member of the pi class subfamily of cytosolic GST and composed of two homodimer GST P1 subunits. The structural analysis indicates that the hGST P1-1 is a sol-uble protein comprised of 209 amino acid residues. The crystal structures show that each GST subunit of the pro-tein dimer contains an independent catalytic site composed of two components. The first is a binding site specific for GSH or a closely related homolog (the G site) formed from a conserved group of amino-acid residues in the amino-ter-minal domain of the polypeptide. The second component is a site that binds the hydrophobic substrate (the H site), which is structurally variable. Amino acid variations of the H-site, among the different GST classes, determine sub-strate specificity (Wu and Dong, 2012).It is known that hGST P1-1 participates in a particular role in one of the mechanisms of the development of resis-tance in cancer cells towards the administration of antican-cer agents in chemotherapy. Human GST P1-1 is overex-pressed in many cancers and contributes to multidrug resis-tance by directly conjugating to chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin, adriamycin, etoposide, thiotepa, and chlorambucil. It is suggested that this resistance is related to high expression of hGST P1-1 in cancers such as breast, lung, colon, pancreas and cervix, thereby contributing to resistance to chemotherapy. Studies have shown that hGST P1-1 levels correlate with resistance to standard chemo-therapy and are elevated in biopsies of tumour tissues that have become resistant to therapy after administration of anticancer agents (Wu and Dong, 2012). Consequently, in-hibitors of human GST P1-1 catalytic activity remain a po-tential therapeutic tool in cancer cell resistance to drugs. In order to overcome this resistance specific hGST P1-1 in-hibitors are in demand.Furthermore, a variety of sulfonamido-containing compounds are apparently accommodated by the H-site of GST and found to be the substrates for GSTs. Data given in the literature are clearly shown that GSTs can mediate the enzymatic cleavage of the sulfonamide bond displaying a sulfonamidase activity by catalyzing the GSH-mediated S6 P 122S6 PP 273572Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 571 - 572 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationshydrolysis of sulfonamide bonds. Groups capable of with-drawing sufficient electron density from the alpha carbon atom to the sulfonyl group are an absolute requirement in this enzymatic process. GST-mediated sulfonamide cleav-age results in the formation of the GS-conjugate, the corre-sponding amine, and sulfur dioxide. The released GS-con-jugate may provide a strong inhibitor against intracellular GSTs, thus facilitating cancer chemotherapy (Mathew et al., 2006).The benzoxazoles have been the aim of many re-searches for many years because they constitute an impor-tant class of heterocyclic compounds exhibiting substantial chemotherapeutic activities.The newly synthesized 2-sub-stituted-5-(4-nitrophenylsulfonamido)benzoxazole de-rivatives, which were screened for the in vitro inhibition of hGST P1-1, exhibited significant inhibitor activities. Among the tested compounds, 2-(4-chlorobenzyl)-5-(4-nitrophenyl-sulfonamido)benzoxazole displayed the most potent inhibitory activity for hGST P1-1 with an IC50 val-ue of 10,2 \u00b5M, showing a similar potency with the used reference drug ethacrynic acid (Ertan-Bolelli et al., 2014).The molecular docking studies performed by us-ing CDocker method is revealed that the new synthesized 2-substituted-5-(4-nitrophenyl-sulfonamido)benzoxazoles are acting as catalytic inhibitors of hGST P1-1 by binding to the H-site and performing conjugates with GSH forming S-(4-nitrophenyl)-GS complex via nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction (Ertan-Bolelli et al., 2014). It is reported that the active site residues Tyr7 and Tyr108 play important roles for the activity of hGST P1-1. Different models have been proposed for the activation of GST, all highlighting the key role of active site resi-dues Tyr7 and Tyr108 (Wu and Bong, 2012). In the mech-anism for activation of GSH, Tyr7 acts as a general base, promotes proton abstraction from the GSH thiol, and cre-ates a thiolate anion with high nucleophilic reactivity. Ad-ditionally, the hydroxyl group of Tyr108 appears to con-tribute to the catalytic mechanism in the conjugation reac-tion of GSH with the docked sulfonamide-substituted ben-zoxazoles (Ertan-Bolelli et al., 2014,).Moreover, it was found that groups capable of with-drawing sufficient electron density from the alpha carbon atom to the sulfonyl group are an absolute requirement. The electrophilic substructure of the sulfonyl group is sole-ly responsible for activation of the sulfonamide bond to-ward cleavage. On the other hand, the amine portion has little or no impact on the cleavability of sulfonamide sub-strates (Ertan-Bolelli et al., 2014).In conclusion, the newly developed hGSTP1-1 in-hibitory active 2-substituted-5-(4-nitrophenylsulfonami-do)benzoxazoles are promising lead compound for further in vivo studies to develop a new chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment in MDR cancers. It is accepted that the hGST P1-1 contributes directly to drug resistance in some cell types via their catalytic activity. The development of chemotherapy resistant tumour cells is a significant prob-lem encountered in cancer treatment. The finding of over expression of hGST P1-1 in many cancer tissues as well as in drug resistant cell line, suggests that elevated hGST P1-1 expression may be of direct relevance not only to ac-quired resistance, but also in natural resistance. hGST P1-1 has been shown to catalyse the conjugation of GSH with the alkylating agents chlorambucil and thiotepa, suggest-ing that overexpression of hGST P1-1 in cells exposed to these drugs would confer resistance. Elevated cellular lev-els of hGST P1-1 have been shown to accompany resis-tance to various common anticancer drugs, and the addi-tion of the GST inhibitors will be restored sensitivity to al-kylating agents in drug-resistant cells. Therefore inhibitors of hGST P1-1 catalytic activity remain as a potential ther-apeutic tool in MDR cancer chemotherapy.

Macedonia* pranvera.breznica@uni-pr.eduIntroductionA major advance in the quinolones field came in 1980, when chemists at the Kyorin company reported the prep-aration of norfloxacin, in which the cyclic diamine piper-azine found in pipemidic acid was combined with 6-flou-rine found in flumequine (Andriole, 2000). Later studies revealed that introduction of this atom serves both to in-crease quinolone activity against the enzyme target DNA gyrase and to facilitate penetration into the bacterial cell. Norfloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacte-ria. The fluorine atom at the position 6 increases poten-cy against Gram-negative organisms, while the piperazine moiety at the position 7 is responsible for anti-pseudo-monal activity. As it is known, fluoroquinolones are fairly insoluble in water. Due to presence of basic amine and car-boxylic acid they possess zwitter ionic character, which is reflected on their solubility, lipophilicity and acidity/basic-ity. At acidic pH, both amine and acidic group are protonat-ed providing the molecule positive charge. At high pH val-ues, amine group is in the free base form, while the carbox-yl group exists as a carboxylate anion, providing the over-all molecule negative charge. Therefore, the fluoroquino-lones tend to be more soluble in water at acidic and/or ba-sic pH (Andriole, 2000; Riley et al. 1989), which signifi-cantly affects their permeability. It has been well explained that solubility, dissolution and gastrointestinal permeabili-ty are fundamental parameters that control rate and extent of drug absorption and its bioavailability. In order to devel-op novel compounds based on quinolone core with favor-able physico-chemical properties i.e. higher permeability, we have synthesized different derivatives of norfloxacin by incorporating (benzoylamino)methyl functions (BAM salts) on the free nitrogen of the 7-piperazinyl group. The aim of this study was to evaluate their solubility in wa-ter (logSw) and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) pH 7.4 (logS7.4) and pKa values as well.Materials and methodsNorfloxacin was purchased from Fluka (Sigma-Al-drich ChemieGmbh Munich, Germany), while the com-pounds for preparation of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), NaH2PO4, NaOH and KH2PO4, were purchased from Mer-ck KgaA (Germany). MethodsThe BAM salts and norfloxacin derivatives were syn-thesized by the methods already described (Breznica-Sel-mani et al., 2015). Five different derivatives of norfloxacin were synthesized: 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-{4[(benzoylamino)S6 PP 274574Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 573 - 574 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsmethyl]piperazin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1a), 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-{4-[(4-meth-ylbenzoylamino)methyl]piperazin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-di-hydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1b), 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-{4-[(3-methylbenzoylamino)methyl]piperazin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1c), 1-eth-yl-6-fluoro-7-{4-[(2-chlorobenzoylamino)methyl] piper-azin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1d) and 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-{4-[(3-chlorobenzoylami-no)methyl]piperazin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1e). Solubility of the newly synthesized (benzoylamino)methyl derivatives of norfloxacin and nor-floxacin as a reference was determined in water and in PBS (pH 7.4) using a static equilibrium method (Zhang and Wang, 2008). An excess of the compounds was exposed to the solvents, accordingly, the mixtures were allowed to be stirred in a thermostatic water bath at 37 \u00b1 1 oC (Haake, SWB 20, Waltham, MA, USA) and the samples were as-sayed once every 4 h until the analyzing results were repli-cated three consecutive times. Afterwards, the supernatant solutions, obtained by ultracentrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 15 minutes, were filtered to ensure that they were free of particulate matter before sampling. The concentration of the synthesized compounds and norfloxacin was quanti-fied by UV absorption at \u03bbmax 271-275 nm (Shimadzu UV \u2013 1800, Japan). The whole procedure was light-protect-ed. Sodium thiosulphate was added to the medium when PBS pH 7.4 was used to prevent oxidation. All the solubil-ity experiments were repeated at least three times, and the mean values were considered as the measured results. The logScalc was calculated by online ChemAxon\u2019s software for fast and accurate predictions of basic physicochem-ical properties such as logP, logD, pKa and logS (www.chemicalize.org). ChemAxon\u2019saqueous solubility predic-tor is based on the topology of the molecules. To determine the pKa\u2019s of all synthesized compounds and norfloxacin, a potentiometric titration was applied and for data analysis, second-derivative method was used. As it was reported by Qiang and Adams (2004), the second-derivative method, widely used to determine the pKa\u2019s of most drugs, is the most convenient for determination of pKa value among the three most applicable (Gran\u2019s plot, second-derivative and the least-square non-linear regression), because it is inde-pendent of titrate and titrant concentrations.Results and discussionThe experimentally determined solubility data for the leading compound norfloxacin were in agreement with the pharmacopeia and literature data that point to very slight water solubility (0.1-1 mg/mL) and sharp increase in sol-ubility at pH below 4 and above 10 due to the amphoteric nature (Dua et al., 2007). The water solubility of the syn-thesized derivatives, experimentally determined, was low-er than the one of the leading compound norfloxacin, rang-ing from 0.005 (1b) to 0.030 mg/mL (1d). Considering the solubility in PBS (pH 7.4), similar values for norfloxacin derivatives were observed, ranging from 0.011 mg/mL (1e) to 0,036 mg/mL (1d), all being lower than the solubility of norfloxacin (0.447 mg/mL). However, it must be empha-sized that the solubility of norfloxacin as hydrochloride salt was used as a reference. Lower solubility of these newly synthesized compounds can be explained by the lipophilic and inductive character of the (benzoylamino)methyl moi-ety that disfavors ionization. There was no agreement be-tween the predicted and experimentally determined data for solubility both in water and PBS (pH 7.4) for all the compounds. pKa values were readily determined by inspection of the second-derivative plot. The experimental values ob-tained for norfloxacin as well as calculated ones did not differ significantly from those reported in the literature (Qiang and Adams, 2004). For all the synthesized com-pounds, three pKa values were determined (around 4, 5 and 14), suggesting preservation of the zwitter ionic char-acter of the synthesized compounds.ConclusionFive derivatives of norfloxacin were synthesized. All the synthesized compounds have lower water solubility and potentially higher lipophylicity than the leading com-pound norfloxacin. The experimental pKa values obtained for the leading compound as well as calculated ones did not differ significantly from those reported in the literature for norfloxacin.ReferencesAndriole, V.T., 2000.

Macedonia* pranvera.breznica@uni-pr.eduIntroductionN-Mannich bases are of particular interest in drug chemistry because of their potential to be used as prodrugs of NH-acidic drugs containing amide, imide, ureide and amine moieties (Bala et al., 2014; Stella et al., 2007). With respect to the amines, N-Mannich bases are useful when an increase in their lipophilicity is required. Lipophilicity is one of the most important determinants of the pharmaco-kinetic characteristics of a drug since it is related to its ab-sorption as well as distribution to the target site. Lipophi-licity of the quinolones as an important factor in the qui-nolones intestinal absorption is considered responsible for the poor relationship between their in vivo and in vitro ac-tivity (Cabrera Perez et al., 2002). Therefore, in these com-pounds, formation of N-Mannich base could suppress the pKa, which means that an important proportion could re-main unionized at the pH of intestine. With an aim to increase lipophylicity of norfloxacin, we have synthesized five different derivatives of norflox-acin [1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-{4[(benzoylamino)methyl]pi-perazin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxyl-ic acid (1a), 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-{4-[(4-methylbenzoylami-no)methyl]piperazin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1b), 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-{4-[(3-meth-ylbenzoylamino)methyl] piperazin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-di-hydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1c), 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-{4-[(2-chloro-benzoylamino)methyl] piperazin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1d) and 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-{4-[(3-chlorobenzoylamino)methyl]pi-perazin-1-yl}-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (1e)], by incorporating (benzoylamino)methyl func-tions on the free nitrogen of the 7-piperazinyl group. In ad-dition to the structural characterization of these novel com-pounds as potential N-Mannich base prodrugs of norfloxa-cin, distribution behavior of these compounds between n-octanol and buffer solution (pH 7.4) was mater of inter-est. In addition, logD7.4 values, experimentally obtained, were compared with the predicted ones by computation-al method developed by ChemAxon (http://www.chemi-calize.org//).Materials and methodsNorfloxacin and 1-octanol were purchased from Flu-ka (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie Gmbh Munich, Germany). The compounds for preparation of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), NaH2PO4, NaOH and KH2PO4, were purchased from Merck KgaA (Germany). The experimental partition coefficient (D) between n-octanol and PBS (pH 7.4) was determined by shaking flask method described by Abuo-Rahma et al. (2009).

After-wards, equal volumes of each solution and n-octanol were mixed, vortexed for 3 min and agitated for 12 h in a shak-ing water bath at 25 \u00b1 0.1 oC. The test tubes were protected from light by wrapping in aluminum foil. Before a partition coefficient was determined, the organic and aqueous phase was mutually saturated by shaking for 24 h at the temper-ature of the experiment. After equilibration, the octanol phase was removed with a Pasteur pipette and both phases were assayed spectrophotometrically at \u03bbmax 270-280 nm. The experimental partition coefficient D was determined from equation: D = Ci- Cw/Cw* Vw/ V0, where Ci rep-resents the total concentration of solute in both phases af-ter distribution, Cw the solute concentration in the aqueous phase after distribution; Vw represents the volume of the aqueous and Vo the volume of the organic phase. All par-tition coefficient determinations were made in triplicate. The logDcalc was calculated by online ChemAxon\u2019s soft-ware (www.chemicalize.org/), where both logP and logD predictions are based on a modified version of the meth-od of Viswanadhan et al. (1989). The predicted partition coefficients are composed of the molecules\u2019 atomic incre-ments and the applied modifications include the redefini-tion of selected atom types to accommodate electron delo-calization and the addition of contributions of ionic forms. The logP value of zwitterions is calculated from the logD at the isoelectric point. Also, the effect of hydrogen bonds on logP is considered if the formation of a six membered ring between suitable donor and acceptor atoms can take place. As the logD values are pH-dependent, the logD cal-culation relies on the pKa prediction process.Results and discussionGenerally, the experimentally obtained distribution coefficients of norfloxacin derivatives were higher than the one of the corresponding leading compound, with the logD7.4exp ranging from -0.91 to 0.58 (vs. logD7.4exp -0.89 for norfloxacin). To reveal a correlation between the experimental and calculated values, a linear regression was performed. Weak correlation R2=0.046 between the calcu-lated and the experimental values for all synthesized com-pounds was observed. Similar data were reported from oth-er researchers as well (Abuo-Rahma et al., 2009). One of the reasons for this weak correlation may be zwitterion-ic nature of the fluoroquinolones at physiological pH. It is clear that at pH corresponding to the isoelectric point, zwit-terions and neutral molecules are present at their highest concentrations. Therefore, this ratio is remarkably impor-tant feature to describe the lipophilicity of fluoroquinolones (Bakhotmah et al., 2011). Our results revealed that the iso-electric points of the synthesized compounds are around pH 5-7. According to Kujawaski et al. (Kujawski et al., 2012), predicted logD is calculated only for neutral com-pounds. Programs for calculating logD are based on break-ing molecules into fragments and summing these constant fragment values plus certain correction factors. Consider-ing that, polyprotic equation becomes more complicated and potentially accumulates errors due to the logD and pKa predictions (Kujawski and Popielarska, 2012). This may be a reason for flimsy correlation between the predicted and experimental values of logD7.4 for the synthesized com-pounds in our study.ConclusionNovel (benzoylamino)methyl derivatives of fluoroqui-nolones were synthesized in one step and in high yields, starting from the leading compound norfloxacin. Addi-tion of (benzoylamino)methyl functions in the piperazinyl ring of the leading compounds by substitution of hydrogen atom at position 4 resulted in formation of potentially use-ful antimicrobial compounds. The structures of the synthe-sized derivatives were confirmed by different spectroscop-ic techniques. The lipophilicity of the synthesized deriva-tives was higher than the ones of the leading compound, in-dicating possibility for improved bioavailability and pene-tration into bacterial cells.ReferencesAbuo-Rahma, Gel-D., Sarhan, A., Gad, G.F., 2009.

MTX was first administered to chil-dren with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in 1948. MTX became the first drug that induced remission. Remis-sions were short, but the principle was clear, antifolates could suppress proliferation of malignant cells, and could thereby re-establish normal bone-marrow function. MTX received FDA approval in 1953. Since that time it has been used worldwide for a variety of medical interventions.Firstly, MTX has been used as a parenteral formula-tion for cancer treatment. The use of MTX in the treatment of psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis dates from the 1960s. From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, many rheumatol-ogists were reporting their experiences with MTX use in rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Ward, 1985). MTX can be given orally or by intravenous, intramuscular or subcuta-neous injection (Jundt et al, 1993). Intramuscular, intrave-nous or subcutaneous administration is usually reserved for patients with poor oral bioavailability of the drug or poor adherence to oral therapy, or when the cost is an is-sue. Weekly dosing of MTX is recommended. More fre-quent administration than weekly increases the risk of tox-icity. The entire dose can be administered at once or divid-ed into three doses taken over a 24-hour period (i.e., every eight hours). MTX should never be given in daily doses. During the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s many studies were done with MTX to determine if it could suppress the growth of a tub-al or ectopic pregnancy. Researchers discovered that MTX could be given as a safe treatment for the ectopic pregnan-cy treatment cured without surgery. Further research found that MTX could also be used to induce a chemical abor-tion. A small percentage of the cases required surgical in-tervention. The benefit of a MTX-induced abortion is that if there is an unknown tubal pregnancy it will be treated. MTX has also been found efficacious in the treatment of other diseases, including psoriasis, asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn\u2019s disease, myositis and vasculitis. Many physicians use MTX for its steroid-sparing proper-ties in patients with asthma and others who may have side effects related to corticosteroid use. The key of the success of MTX in the treatment any of these diseases (with the exception of ALL) is the recognition that low-dose thera-py achieves efficacy while minimizing side effects (Moss, 1995).MTX is a toxic medication, but if it is dosed correctly and monitored appropriately, its toxic effects can be min-imized. These effects are categorized as minor or major. Minor toxic effects such as stomatitis, malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and mild alopecia are not life threatening but occur in 20 to 30 percents of patients. Other effects in this category include fatigue, mood alter-ation, dizziness, fever, myalgia and polyarthralgia. Most minor toxic effects are associated with depletion of fo-late. Folate supplementation with 1 mg daily or 7 mg once weekly should be considered for all patients. Studies show that low-dose folate does not interfere with the efficacy of MTX (ACRM, 1996). Most rheumatologists advise pa-tients to avoid taking the folate dose on the same day as the MTX dose. Often, minor toxic effects respond to a re-S6 PP 276578Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 577 - 578 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsduction in the MTX dose or an adjustment in the dosing schedule. Major toxic effects of MTX, such as hepatic, re-nal, pulmonary and bone marrow disorders, occur less fre-quently than the minor effects but may be life threatening.In order to improve therapeutic efficacy and the com-fort of the application of MTX, new pharmaceutical for-mulation is ongoing. Controlled release of MTX has been achieved by several techniques, but mostly in in vitro and preclinical animal models. Formulations of MTX that have been recently developed in order to improve cancer treat-ment include injectable thermosensitive hydrogels con-taining MTX-loaded chitosan-based microspheres, folic acid-chitosan-MTX core-shell nanoparticles, thermosensi-tive systems prepared on biocompatible polymer Pluron-ic F-127 as a vehicle, MTX-loaded alpha-lactalbumin mi-croparticles, MTX-monoclonal antibody conjugates, MTX intercalated in a nanoceramic vehicle magnesium alumin-ium layered double hydroxide, coated with poly(D,L-lac-tide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). Most of these pharmaceutical formulations have demonstrated superiority when com-pared to conventional formulations of MTX in terms of localized drug delivery, long-term sustained drug release, and good biocompatibility (Beidokhti et al., 2016). Nov-el topical formulations of MTX have been also evaluated for the potential use in the treatment of psoriasis. Some of these formulations with enhanced skin penetration of MTX include microemulsions, nanogels, niosomes, liposomal hydrogels, deformable liposomes and solid lipid nanopar-ticles (SLN) (Avasatthi et al., 2015). The latest topical formulations of MTX for the treatment of psoriasis pre-pared as nano-vesicles use mostly bioadhesive surfactant systems containing polysorbate 60 or 80 as surfactants. NLC-based smart gel of MTX composed of lipids, surfac-tant Tween 80 and co-surfactant PEG 400, was formulated for intra-articular administration that could give site-spe-cific delivery of a drug to the rheumatic joints (Shinde et al., 2016). MTX was also formulated in transdermal patch-es with different ratios of ethyl-cellulose and hydroxypro-pylmethyl-cellulose, and permeation enhancers Tween-80, Span-80, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and isopropyl my-ristate. These transdermal patches were evaluated for in vi-tro release, ex vivo permeation and pharmacokinetics in vivo, and all formulations exerted improved bioavailabili-ty in comparison to MTX without enhancers (Rama et al., 2012).In summary, MTX plays a significant role in the treat-ment of various diseases, but toxicity remains the main is-sue of the use of MTX. Therefore, novel pharmaceutical formulations, which have reduced toxicity, better pharma-cokinetic properties and targeted delivery, have emerged. Promising results have been obtained, but mostly in in vi-tro and in vivo animal studies. Therefore, these new formu-lations and drug delivery systems of MTX need to be fur-ther evaluated, especially in clinical settings.Acknowledgement: This project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No. 690876ReferencesRossi, S., 2013.

The rough ER, as-sembled with ribosomes, plays a key role in protein syn-thesis, folding, posttranslational modification, and trans-port. The smooth ER has a central role in the biosynthesis of lipids and steroids, assembly of lipid bilayers, metabo-lism of carbohydrates, metabolism of drugs and xenobi-otics and regulation of calcium intracellular homeostasis. Quality control mechanisms of the cell ensure that new-ly synthesized proteins are folded into their correct config-uration according to their function and destination in the cell. Therefore, protein folding in particular represents an exquisitely orchestrated aspect of protein synthesis in the ER that involves pathways for folding, assembly, modifi-cation, quality control, and recycling. In addition to an ox-idizing environment, protein folding requires the participa-tion of chaperone proteins, glycosylating enzymes and ad-equately high calcium levels. Appropriate folding of the nascent polypeptide chain is achieved through the actions of a series of molecular chaperones and foldases, which keep the polypeptide in soluble form and facilitate folding into a thermodynamically favored structure. Since the ER provides high fidelity quality control in protein synthesis, maturation and transport, it is a highly dynamic organelle, whose complex function can be significantly influenced by various factors both inside the cell and in its microenviron-ment. Failures in control mechanisms lead to accumulation of unfolded, misfolded, insoluble or otherwise damaged proteins in the lumen of the ER resulting in a state known as ER stress (Stankov et al, 2013). Continued accumulation of incorrectly folded proteins can irreversibly and irrepara-bly damage cellular functions leading to cell death. There-fore, several cellular sensors and pathways have evolved to respond to this threat and to reduce the risk. Prime among these is the unfolded protein response (UPR), a signaling pathway primarily aiming at protecting cellular integrity by restoring proper ER folding capacity and overall pro-tein processing. However, terminally misfolded proteins that cannot be repaired may be removed from the cell by one of two separate processes. One process is ER-associat-ed degradation (ERAD), which involves the retro-translo-cation of irreparably misfolded proteins from the ER back into the cytosol, where they are ubiquitinated and subse-quently subjected to degradation via the proteasome. Fur-thermore, insoluble misfolded proteins may be assembled together with other cellular debris into aggresomes (jux-tanuclear complexes that occur as a cell culture phenom-enon, for sequestration of toxic, aggregated proteins) and then recycled via autophagy.Material and methodsDetailed and comprehensive search of PubMed and Scopus databases was carried out for original and review articles using the key words: endoplasmic reticulum stress, unfolded protein response, diabetes mellitus, in order to determine patophysiological implications of ER stress in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to identify potential ER stress-targeting antidiabetic agent.Results and discussionAn imbalance in energy intake and expenditure leads to obesity, a major health threat that increases the risk of S6 PP 277580Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 579 - 580 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsT2D, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Obese subjects show activation of UPR in metabolic tissues including ad-ipose tissue, liver, and the pancreas. Obesity is also asso-ciated with both hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance, along with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Studies with genetically obese or diet-induced obese mice revealed elevated levels of ER stress-associated markers: RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic trans-lation initiation factor-2 alpha phosphorylation, inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1)-mediated JNK activation, and higher amounts of ER chaperone protein, glucose-regulat-ed protein 78 (GRP78) in the liver and adipose tissue. ER stress in obesity is thought to be induced by an augment-ed demand for protein synthesis under nutrient excess and by elevated levels of saturated free fatty acids (FFA). Ex-cess in saturated FFA, especially palmitate has been shown to cause ER stress and to activate the UPR in pancreat-ic \u03b2-cells and hepatocytes by altering the integrity of ER membrane. It is well-recognized that hyperglycemia, high plasma levels of saturated FFAs and obesity in general are key risk factors for the development of T2D. The same conditions are identified as triggers of ER stress, particu-larly in organs such as the liver and pancreas. In addition, leptin resistance, a condition that has been documented in the majority of the obese population, has been shown to contribute to obesity-linked disorders via ER stress. Obe-sity induces T2D, a metabolic disorder characterized by a combination of insulin resistance, dysregulated hepat-ic glucose production, and inadequate insulin secretion by pancreatic \u03b2-cells. At the molecular level, it involves per-turbations in insulin signaling, such as reduced insulin re-ceptor function and reduced post\u2013insulin receptor phos-phorylation steps. ER stress parameters such as phosphor-ylation of PERK and IRE1, ER-associated protein kinas-es that determine cell fate during UPR, are increased in the liver and adipose tissues of T2D animals (Stankov, 2010). The three branches of the UPR: IRE1, PERK, and activat-ing transcription factor 6 (ATF6), have been implicated in the cellular inflammatory processes. Increased activation of IRE1, X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) and JNK results in decreased insulin receptor signaling and insulin resis-tance. Moreover, ER stress parameters including Grp78, XBP1s, phospho-eIF2\u03b1, and phospho-JNK, are increased in the liver and adipose tissues of obese insulin-resistant non-diabetic humans and these parameters are significant-ly reduced after weight loss. Interestingly, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid that has long been used to treat chronic cholestatic liver disease is emerged as the agent that mitigates ER stress at the cellular level (Stanimirov et al, 2015). The administra-tion of UDCA resulted in normalization of hyperglycemia and restoration of hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity in obese humans. Additionally, UDCA has been shown to act as leptin-sensitizing agent. Therefore, UDCA represents an ER stress-modifying agent with therapeutic potential in ER stress-induced complications of obesity. In accordance, UDCA has been shown to exert an anti-atherogenic activ-ity in diabetic atherosclerosis by targeting ER stress. Ad-ditionally, by ameliorating ER stress-associated detrimen-tal signaling, UDCA improves function of dysfunctional endothelial cells and prevents formation of atherosclerot-ic plaque. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of UDCA-mediated alleviation of ER stress are still to be elu-cidated.ConclusionsMore detailed insight in ER stress mechanisms will provide opportunity to develop UPR-manipulating anti-di-abetic therapeutic strategies. Therapeutic agents aimed at ameliorating ER stress by promoting proper protein pro-cessing and generally supporting proper ER maintenance may have useful effects in the therapy of obesity, T2D, and cardiovascular disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid administra-tion showed some promising results so far; however, fur-ther studies are highly recommendable in order to decipher beneficial effects of its administration on ER stress signal-ing in diabetic patients.AcknowledgmentSupported by the Ministry of education, science and technological development, the Republic of Serbia, Grant III41012.ReferencesStanimirov, B., Stankov, K., Mikov, M., 2015.

Multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampli-fication (MLPA) is a technique for targeted copy number variation (CNV) identification in many human genes simul-taneously. MLPA is a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique that can quantify up to 50 differ-ent genomic targets simultaneously in a single experiment through amplification of specific hybridizing probes (Fab-ris et al., 2011). As the sequence recognized by an MLPA probe is only 50-70 nucleotides long, this assay is very use-ful for detection of deletions or amplifications of single ex-ons (Schouten et al., 2002). The high specificity of MLPA is due to the ability of this method to distinguish sequenc-es differing in length by only one nucleotide. Another ad-vantage of this method is also the low amount of input DNA (minimum of 20-50 ng) required for a successful MLPA re-action (Schouten et al., 2002). Up to 40-50 small specific probes are directed at DNA regions of interest and to ref-erence regions not associated with the disease, providing a resolution greater than FISH or BAC \u2013 based aCGH (Do-nahue et al., 2011). Each probe consists of two oligonu-cleotides (5\u00b4and 3\u00b4end-probes), that hybridize to adjacent sites of the target sequence. The short oligonucleotide con-tains a target-specific sequence and a universal PCR primer X. The long probe consists of a target-specific sequence, a universal PCR primer Y and a stuffer sequence of variable length in between (19-370 nucleotides) to generate the size differences necessary for electrophoretic resolution (Dona-hue et al., 2011; Sellener and Taylor, 2004). The MLPA re-action comprises five steps and requires a thermocycler and automated genetic analyzer for fragment analysis by capil-lary electrophoresis. A crucial step of the MLPA assay, es-pecially when used in the diagnostic setting (i.e. gene dele-tion or when used in the diagnostic setting (i.e. gene dele-tion or and interpretation of results. The most widely used is the Coffalyser software, an Excel-based program able to perform data normalization steps and necessary corrections (Coffa et al., 2008; Jankowski et al. 2008). The results in-terpretation is based on the mathematical comparison be-tween relative quantities of target DNA amplified from a tested (patient) sample vs. those of a normal (control) sam-ple (Abdool et al., 2010). In general, signals are interpret-ed as aberrant at cut-off values below 0.7 (deletion) and above 1.3 (duplication/ amplification) (Eijk-Van Os et al., 2011). The utility of MLPA assay in the testing of acute leu-kemias and myelodysplastic syndromes has been analyzed, confirming excellent accuracy and specificity of MLPA as compared to FISH (Stippia et al., 2012).

Patients signed informed consent for entrance in the study. From each patient was collected 1 mL of material, obtained by bone marrow biopsy (BMB) and put in the test tube with an anticoagulant - K3ED-TA. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was isolated with stan-dard phenol chloroform extraction in the Faculty of Phar-macy, Department of biomolecular sciences, Skopje, Re-public of Macedonia. The material from BMB was cen-trifuged at 3000 rpm, 4\u00b0C, 5 min. The watery upper layer was decanted, and the precipitated cells were washed with 0.9%NaCl, and later washed with lysed solution (1.55M NH4Cl, 0.1M NH4HCO3 and 1mM EDTA Ph 7.4, final concentration), centrifuged at 3000 rpm, 4\u00b0C, 5 min, in or-der to lyse the rest of red cells. The rest of the other cells were digested over night at 37\u00b0C with 0.1M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris, 1mM EDTA in final concentration. The next day was performed fluid-fluid extraction with saturated phenol (pH=8) and Chloroform : Isoamyl alcohol 24:1, after cen-trifugation at 3000 rpm, 4\u00b0C, 5 min. and removal of the up-per watery layer, the precipitation of the DNA with cold 100% ethanol was performed and dissolved with TE puffer (Tris 10mM \u0438 EDTA 1 mM, final concentration). The iso-lated DNA was incubated overnight on 37\u00b0C for homoge-neous dissolution in the puffer. The intactness of the isolat-ed DNA was examined on gel electrophoresis. With Nano-Drop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) was de-termined the concentration of the isolated DNAs. The SALSA MLPA MDS kits (P144 and P145, MRC Holland) were used to detect chromosomal abnormalities commonly associated with MDS. The probe mix contained probes for chromosomes 5, 7, 8, 11, 12 (ETV6), 17 (TP53), 20 and 21 (RUNX1). Analyses were performed with the application of P414-A1 MDS MLPA kits of MRC Holland, according to their protocol. The analysis of the results was performed by software - Coffalyser.Results and discussionOf 70 patients (pts), 33 women (47.1%) and 37 men (52.9%) participated in the study, aged 64.3 years (range 22-86 years). With primary MDS were 66 pts and with 4 pts with t- MDS. Chromosomal abnormalities were de-tected in 32.9% pts (5p+, 5q-, 7p-, 7q-, 8p+, 8q+, 11p-, 12p-, 17p-, 17q+, 19p+, 19p-, 20q-  in different combina-tions), while 67.1% pts had normal findings. According to the WHO patients were classified as follows: RCMD \u2013 34, RCED - 5, 5q syndrome - 1, RARS -1, RAEB 1- 6, RAEB -2 - 6, CMML-1 - 2, CMML-2 - 3, t-MDS - 4,  MDS-u - 2, AML- 6 pts. According to IPSS, distribution was as fol-lows: with low risk - 16 pts (22.9%), with intermediate 1 - 37 (52.9%), with intermediate 2 \u2013 8 (11.3%), with high risk - 9 (12.9). According to R-IPSS, distribution was as follows: with very low risk - 5 (7.1%), with low risk 22 (31.4%), with intermediate risk - 24 (34.3%), with high risk - 10 (14.3%), with very high risk - 9 (12.9%) pts. Patients were treated based on IPSS and R-IPSS. Transformation in AML was registered in 24.3%, after 9.2 months. Over-all survival (OS) was 30.2 months. In pts with chromosom-al abnormalities OS was 25.7 months and in those without chromosomal abnormalities OS 34.2 months, but the dif-ference was not statistically significant (p =0 .13101). 22 patients died.ConclusionMDS MLPA assay is sufficiently specific and repro-ducible to be used in routine diagnostic settings as the first-line genetic screening tool. Data concerning chromosomal abnormalities in MDS enable physicians to make treatment strategy at diagnosis. There are different treatment options for different risk groups including allogeneic transplanta-tion for high and very high risk patients.ReferencesAbdool, A., Donahue, A.C., Wohlgemuth, J.G., Yeh, C.H., 2010.

Data protection and privacy requirements are given in the Declaration of Helsinki (1964-2013) which states: \u201cIt is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical re-search to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research subjects.\u201d All precautions should be taken to protect the privacy of the subjects participat-ing in biomedical research and to minimize the impact of study on their mental, physical and social integrity. Article 24 states: \u201cEvery precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information\u201d. One of the basic principles in the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (R1) (1996), sec-tion 2:11 states: \u201cThe confidentiality of records that could identify subjects should be protected, respecting the priva-cy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the appli-cable regulatory requirement(s).\u201d To this end, each subject that has been enrolled in a clinical trial is assigned a unique identification number in order to protect his/her identity. This identification number is used instead of the name of the entity when the investigator submits reports of adverse events and/or other information related to the clinical tri-al. Personal data protection is a mandatory part of the In-formed Consent, introduced as a compulsory element by the Nuremberg code. In the Informed Consent it is clearly stated that all medical records which contain personal pa-tient data will be kept confidential within the limits of ap-plicable laws and regulations and will not be available to the public. If the study results are published, the identity of the subjects will remain protected. Data protection in EUIn the EU, personal data may be collected only under strictly controlled conditions and for legitimate purposes. Harmonized legislation is established among EU Member States regarding the protection of personal data. In addi-tion, the European Commission keeps constant dialogue with non-EU countries to achieve high level of protection of personal data. Personal data protection in the EU is cur-rently regulated by Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data (1995) and Directive 2002/58/EC on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communication (2002). Directive 95/46/EC provides the legal framework which strives to find the balance between the high level of protection of personal data and the free movement of personal data within the EU. The Directive sets strict limits on the collection and use of personal data and requires each Member State to ap-point an independent national body responsible for the pro-tection of personal data. Directive does not deal explicitly with biomedical research, but it is the basis for principles of protection of personal data in biomedical research. Di-rective 2002/58/EC provides an equivalent level of protec-tion of fundamental rights and freedoms and especially of the right to privacy with regard to the processing of person-al data in the electronic communications sector and the free movement of such data and the equipment for electronic communications and services in EU.Rapid technological development and related regula-tory challenges of privacy protection caused the Europe-an Commission to propose a new regulation on the pro-S6 PP 279584Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 583 - 584 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationstection of individuals with regard of the processing of per-sonal data and their free movement - Data Protection Reg-ulation (\u201cDPR\u201d) (2015). After intense lobbying, the final text of DPR has been agreed on 17th of December 2015. It is expected to come into force in 2018. DPR will re-place the current legislation and the various inconsistent national laws on data protection, with a transitional peri-od of two years. Considering that the collection, process-ing and transfer of personal data, particularly the records of individual subjects/patients in accordance with applica-ble laws are critical to the success of biomedical research, the adoption of this regulation will affect sponsors, inves-tigators and other participants in biomedical research/clin-ical trial. DPR mainly refers to: the unification/qualifica-tion of key-coded data of the subject/patient with which the subject/patient can be identified, clearer definition of the roles and responsibilities of the sponsor and the con-tract research organizations as responsible for the process-ing and control of data, clarification of the guidelines on existing restrictions on the transfer of data from the EU to parties outside the EU, the introduction of legal sanctions for violating laws on data protection, as well as adminis-trative penalties.Data protection in USAIn the USA, the medical information is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA applies to health workers dealing with the processing of medical data and all other entities that come into contact with medical information. Standards for privacy of individually identified health information are given inthe HIPAA Privacy Rule and reffer to the col-lection, use and protection of health information or medi-cal records. However, HIPPA-rules are related to defined entities only, they protect electronic data only and many of the entities are not or cannot be harmonized with the HIPPA safety requirements. Additionally, there are many guidelines that have been developed by government agen-cies and industry associations, which are not legally bind-ing, used only for self-regulation and are considered \u201cgood practices\u201d.Data protection in the Republic of MacedoniaIn Macedonia, the Law on Personal Data Protection (2008) regulates the protection of personal data as funda-mental rights and freedoms of individuals. The principles of this law are implemented in biomedical research. Arti-cle 2 defines special categories of personal data \u201cdata con-cerning health, including genetic data\u201d.  Article 8 prohib-its the processing of special categories of personal data, but an exception is made if \u201cit is necessary for the purposes of medical diagnosis, treatment or management of a health in-stitution and if it is carried by a person whose profession is to provide medical care under oath of secrecy of the infor-mation revealed to him in the course of his profession and if an appropriate safeguards are established in order to per-form activities of public interest determined by law or by decision of the Directorate\u201d. In addition, according to the Article 31, the personal data shall be transferred in another state only if the second one provides the same level of pro-tection. With this being stated it is safe to conclude that if biomedical research is performed in accordance with this Law, the code of ethics of health workers and an appropri-ate level of protection is provided and there is no barrier for scientific research.ConclusionIt is clear that different countries have different ap-proaches to personal data protection in clinical studies. In the USA there is no comprehensive national law regulat-ing the collection and use of personal data. The novel DPR in EU is expected to be directly applicable to all Mem-ber States, to provide comprehensive and consistent lev-el of protection, to be unique regimen for protection and in the same time simple but stronger executive framework in all Member States. When entering into force it is expected to affect national regulations, including the one in Mace-donia.

Pharmacoepidemiology as a science evaluates the risks and benefits of drug use in large numbers of patients in everyday practice. Although (pharmaco)epidemiological studies are non-interventional there is still a risk of dis-closure of sensitive medical information. The Internation-al Pharmacoepidemiological Society (ISPE) recognizes the need for balance between the protection of personal and medical data of patients and the necessity of relevant sci-entific and medical information to be used to solve medical and other problems related to public health. ISPE recom-mendations are based on existing laws on data protection and ethical guidelines, including inspection and approval by ethics committees. In accordance with these recommen-dations: (a) the studies should be designed in a way to pro-tect the personal and medical information and confidenti-ality of medical records; (b) ISPE and other professional societies should continue to develop codes of conduct and \u201cgood practices\u201d for epidemiological research and should encourage the researchers to follow them; (c) all pharma-coepidemiological studies that use personal data should be approved by ethics committees before commencing the study; (d) ethics committees may waive a requirement for written informed consent in cases where the direct harm to individuals is unlikely and individually identifiable data are not published; (e) the use of sophisticated informa-tion technology should be encouraged to ensure, where ap-propriate, that no identifying information remains on re-search datasets; (f) secondary research and statistical anal-ysis of data already collected for other purposes should be approved, provided that the secondary research serves the public health and appropriate measures are implemented to protect personal data; (g) ISPE supports the notion that re-search using completely anonymize databases should not require IRB approval or specific patient authorization for each use of the data; (h) ISPE supports the development of guidelines and techniques for the anonymization of datas-ets; (i) the international transfer of data should be permit-ted under the condition that either a comparable legal lev-el of data protection exists in the recipient country or spe-cial provisions are made by the person responsible for the data to ensure the same level of data protection exists in the country from which the data are transferred; and (j) unau-thorized access to or distribution of personal and medical data should be subject to legal penalties sufficient to act as an obstacle (http://www.pharmacoepi.org/).Data protection in EUIn January 2012, the European Commission present-ed the draft of a new General Data Protection Regula-tion (GDPR) to the European Parliament and the Coun-cil of the EU. The GDPR is planned to replace the Direc-tive 95/46/EC (1995), which constitutes the present Euro-pean legal framework for processing of personal data. The first Articles with specific relevance for scientific research are concerned with general principles (Article 5) and law-fulness (Article 6) of personal data processing. Article 5b lays down that personal data shall be collected for speci-fied, explicit and legitimate purposes and may not be fur-ther processed in a way incompatible with those purpos-es. This corresponds to the same principle in the current Directive 95/46/EC. However, in the Directive 95/46/EC there is an exemption for research i.e. that further process-S6 PP 280586Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 585 - 586 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsing of data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes is not to be considered as incompatible with the original pur-pose as long as Member States provide appropriate safe-guards. This exemption was omitted in DPR, significant-ly reducing the scope for data sharing between research groups and severely restraining the use of retrospective study designs. If taken literally, the omission of the exemp-tion threatens the (pharmaco)epidemiological research. In the final version of the DPR that has been agreed upon on 17th of December 2015 Article 5b has been extended: \u201cfur-ther processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, or scientific and historical research pur-poses or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Ar-ticle 83(1), not be considered incompatible with the initial purpose\u201d. Introducing this exemption gives a legal basis for the (pharmaco)epidemiological research, especially the retrospective study designs. Data protection in USADepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) have realized that it is not always possible to get an au-thorization to use protected health information for research purposes, especially in research relating to public health and (pharmaco)epidemiological research.The HIPAA Pri-vacy Rule (2004) acknowledges the possibility of selection bias if an authorization is sought. Due to these reasons, the Department of HHS decided that there are certain circum-stances under which protected health information for re-search purposes can be used without an authorization, but certain criteria must be met and strict safeguards should be established. For the authorization waiver to be granted by the Ethics committee the following criteria should be met: (a) the research cannot be conducted without the waiver; (b) the research cannot be conducted without access to the protected health information; (c) use and disclosure of pro-tected health information has minimal risk of disclosure of the privacy of the subject; (d) there is an appropriate plan to protect data from misuse and disclosure; (e) there is an appropriate plan for the destruction of all identifiers con-tained in the protected health information as soon as pos-sible and in accordance with the research; (f) there is an adequate written assurance that the protected health infor-mation shall not be used or disclosed again to another in-dividual or legal entity, unless required by law, in cases of authorized oversight of the research or for other research which has a license to use and disclose the protected health information.Data protection in the Republic of MacedoniaIn Macedonia, the Law on Protection of Personal Data (\u201cOfficial Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\u201d No.7/05, 103/08) regulates the protection of personal data as funda-mental rights and freedoms of individuals. Article 5 states: \u201csecondary data processing for historic, scientific or sta-tistical research shall be deemed in compliance with the primary purposes for collecting data, provided that appro-priate safeguards are established which are in accordance with the law\u201d. This clearly shows that the use of person-al medical data for purposes of (pharmaco)epidemiolog-ical research is justified and by this law allowed. Article 11 states: \u201eNotwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the controller has no obligation to inform the data subject about the processing of personal data for historical, scien-tific or statistical purposes, if it is impossible or requires a disproportionate effort or expense\u201d. This allows for the personal data to be used without Informed Consent if ap-propriate safeguard of the personal data is in place. The ob-jectives of the (pharmaco)epidemiological research are by all means scientific and the methods of data processing are mostly statistical and the research itself serves the public health which deems (pharmaco)epidemiological research in compliance with this Law.ConclusionNon-interventional studies represent a significant por-tion of the combined (pharmaco)epidemiological litera-ture and are of great public health significance. Restric-tive interpretation of regulation could have devastating consequences for large (pharmaco)epidemiological stud-ies where obtaining Informed Consent is not possible, or where non-participation in the study is a threat to impar-tiality and accuracy of the results.ReferencesDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data; http://eurlex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:html, accessed on 01.07.2015.International Society for Pharmacoepidemilogy ISPE. http://www.pharmacoepi.org/, accessed on 25.11.2015.Law on Protection of Personal Data (\u201cOfficial Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia\u201d No.7/05, 103/08).Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation); http://statewatch.org/news/2015/dec/eu-council-dp-reg-draft-final-compromise-15039-15.pdf,  accessed on 18.03.2016.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institutes of Health.

There are two isoforms of COX: COX-1 which is considered to be physiological and con-stitutively expressed in many tissues and COX-2 which is considered to be inducible and pathological due to the fact that this isoform catalyzes production of prostaglandins which are mediators of pain and inflammation (Kiefer and Dannhardt, 2004; Goodsell, 2000). While the inhibition of COX-2 isoform is beneficial, the inhibition of COX-1 is considered to be associated with many side effects, but especially with gastric side effects. Conventional Nonste-roidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), like ibuprofen are non-selective and they inhibit both COX isoforms, thus producing gastric side effects which may vary from mild, like gastrointestinal irritation to very serious, like ulcer-ation and bleeding (Radi and Khan, 2006). Ibuprofen is of-ten an inspirational drug for developing novel compounds with anti-inflammatory activity, and often is used as a ref-erence drug for comparison of anti-inflammatory activity.We have previously reported that simple derivatives of \u03b2-aryl-\u03b2-hydroxyalkanoic acids exhibit good anti-in-flammatory activity and good gastric tolerability (Savi\u0107 et al., 2011). These compounds are interesting because their structure deviate from the usual structure of selec-tive COX-2 inhibitor: their structure is simple, they con-tain carboxylic acid moiety and they lack sulphonamide or sulphone group. It is expected that these agents have com-parable efficiency to ibuprofen, but a better safety profile.Gastric tolerability can be assessed by method of Ad-ami et al. (1963). Macroscopic observations can be sup-ported by biochemical parameters which are oxidative stress markers: malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH).It has been reported in literature that compounds show-ing less ulcerogenic activity also showed reduced MDA content, a byproduct of lipid peroxidation (Pohle et al., 2001). Therefore, MDA levels were determined in stom-ach tissues of animals which were treated with the highest dose of investigated compounds and obtained results were compared with result for ibuprofen. GSH is a tripeptide, a superoxide radical scavenger and it protects thiol protein groups required for maintaining the integrity of cell against oxidation. GSH is present in the stomach at high concen-trations and plays an important role in maintaining the in-tegrity of gastric mucosa (Hirota et al., 1989), so it is im-portant to determine levels of this parameter in rat stom-ach. Quotient of GSH and MDA (in arbitrary units, AU) is referred as oxidative stress index (OSI) and can efficiently point out the compound exhibiting the best gastric tolera-bility (Petrovic et al., 2014). It is very convenient to intro-duce this index in order to precisely understand the results regarding compounds influence at oxidative stress mech-anisms.

After the animals were sacrificed, their stomach was removed, opened along the greater curvature and washed out with saline. Lesions were examined using illuminated magnifier (3X) in order to assess gastric dam-age according to a modified scoring system of Adami et al (1963). These stomachs were immediately frozen and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until determination of total protein con-tent, MDA and GSH. To prepare the tissue homogenates, unfrozen stomach tissues were roughly chopped with liq-uid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar. The fragmented tis-sues (0.5 g each) were mixed with 4.5 ml of homogeni-zation tris-buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4), homogenized on ice using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer, filtered and centri-fuged at 1000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. The supernatants were then used to determine the enzymatic activities (Mei et al., 2012). Both MDA and GSH are determined according to methods used by Uskokovi\u0107-Markovi\u0107 et al. (2007).Results and discussionSeven acids [3-hydroxy-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-3-phenyl-propanoic acid (1); 3-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3-hy-droxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid (2); 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid (3); 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropanoic acid (4); 3-(3-(trifluo-romethyl)phenyl)-3-hydroxy-3-phenyl-propanoic acid (5); 3-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid (6); 3-(3-methylphenyl)-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoic acid (7)] were synthesized using already reported modification of Reformatsky reaction additionally optimized by increas-ing temperature of reaction to 65-69\u00b0C (Savi\u0107 et al., 2011). None of the synthesized substances produced any sig-nificant gastric lesions. The changes observed were in range of 0\u20131 according to the Adami\u2019s scoring scale. MDA val-ues for all compounds except for compound 2 were lower than for ibuprofen. GSH level is increased in groups treat-ed with ibuprofen, compounds 1, 2 and 6 compared to the control group. The level of GSH in groups treated with oth-er compounds is similar to the control group. OSI was very high In gastric mucosa of animals received compounds 1 (186.45), 3 (132.6), 6 (137.4) and 7 (114.8) which means that these compounds produce good protection against ox-idative stress in gastric tissue. In this respect compounds 2 (61.0) and 5 (48.0) produced more oxidative stress in gas-tric tissue than ibuprofen, while compound 4 (89.3) was on a pair with ibuprofen (79.9). ConclusionAlthough macroscopic examination of rat stomach showed that none of tested compounds produced any sig-nificant gastric lesions, biochemical parameters differen-tiated these compounds according to oxidative stress they produced. The obtained biochemical results indicated that ibuprofen produced significantly more oxidative stress in gastric tissue than four out of seven synthetized com-pounds. The results impose the conclusion that this four compounds exhibit better gastric tolerability than ibupro-fen. Using OSI to describe results is much more concise way to perceive oxidative stress than using MDA and GSH values separately.ReferencesAdami, E., Marazzi-Uberti, E., Turba, C., 1963.

The discovery of a prophylactic and a curative treatment for this disease still represents a challenge for the researchers. Another subject of scientific interest is the discovery of antitumoral agents of natural origin with potent anticancer activity and low/no toxic effects against normal cells. Betulin is a natural compound, member of the pentacyclic triterpene family, obtained in high yields from the bark of the birch tree (Krol et al., 2015). Betulin is known for its multiple pharmacological effects, including: anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anticancer and antiangiogenic effects (Dehelean et al., 2013; Krol et al., 2015). The use of betulin as an anticancer agent presents multiple advantages (potent anticancer effects and no toxicity in vitro against healthy cells and in vivo even at high doses), but one of its major disadvantages is its low water solubility, which limits its administration in vivo. A goal of the researchers was to find a proper formulation to increase betulin solubility in aqueous solutions what leads to increased bioavailability and higher antitumor activity. The aim of our study was to obtain a silver nanoformu-lation of betulin and to verify its pharmacological effects in vitro on a human lung carcinoma cell line - A549. Materials and methodsIn this study we used A549 human lung carcinoma cells. The cell line was purchased from ECACC (European Collection of Cell Cultures) at passage no. 39. A549 cells were kept in liquid nitrogen and one week before the ex-periment started, we cultured in specific medium culture.The cells were cultured in high glucose (4.5 g/l) Dul-becco\u2019s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM \u2013 Sigma Aldrich, Germany) supplemented with 15 mM Hepes, 2 mM L-glu-tamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin, and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were kept in a hu-midified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C and were pas-saged every two days. Cells number was assessed by using Neubauer chamber in the presence of Trypan Blue.For the cell viability assay, the cells(10000 cells/ well) were cultured in 96-well plates and left for 24h to adhere. The cells were stimulated for 24 h with different concen-trations (10 and 50 uM) and were divided in the following groups: 1 - cells stimulated with DMSO (dimethylsulfox-ide), 2 - cells stimulated with betulin dissolved in DMSO, 3 - cells stimulated with silver nanoformulation blank and 4 - cells stimulated with betulin silver nanoformulation. The cells viability was assessed by Alamar blue and MTT methods. It was also tested the effect of the new formula-tion against the migration capacity of the cells by scratch assay and pictures were taken at different time points: 0h, 3h, 8h and 24h.Results and discussionStimulation of the A549 cells with different concen-trations of betulin silver nanoformulation (10 and 50 uM) for 24h induced cytotoxicity of the cells in a dose-depen-dent manner. These results were compared with the results obtained after the stimulation with betulin dissolved in di-methylsulfoxide (DMSO), the solvent in which betulin has an increased solubility and the cytotoxic effect was higher S6 PP 282590Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 589 - 590 (2016)Clinical pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular sciencesPoster presentationsin the case of the nanoformulation.It was also tested the effect of these formulations against the capacity of migration of the A549 cells by the means of scratch assay and it was observed that at the smallest concentration used in the study, the nanoformula-tion was able to inhibit the migration of the cells. Other studies developed on human lung carcinoma showed that betulin solved in DMSO had cytotoxic and anti-migratory effects (Rzeski et al., 2009). The anticancer mechanism of action of betulin is still unknown and sev-eral studies proposed as mechanism of action induction of apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (Pyo et al., 2009). Another mechanism of action of betulin was the inhibition of tumor cells proliferation through activation of AMPK signaling (Li et al., 2014).ConclusionOur results showed that betulin formulated as a sil-ver nanoformulation had a potent antiproliferative effect against human lung carcinoma cell line - A549 after 24h stimulation. Further studies will be realized in order to elu-cidate the anticancer mechanism of action of betulin and for the evaluation of the in vivo effects in animal models with human lung carcinoma.This research was supported by the PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-2842 grant, no. 180/2015.

Richard Bright first described the as-sociation of pericarditis with renal failure in his land-mark observation of 100 cases of patients with \u2018albumin-ous urine\u2019, which appeared in the Guys Hospital Report of 1836 (Bright, 1836). Autopsy studies demonstrated pericarditis or pericardial effusion in 37 of these patients. ,,Uremic pericarditis\u201d is a term used to describe patients who develop clinical manifestations of pericarditis before renal replacement therapy or within 8 weeks of its initia-tion. ,,Dialysis pericarditis\u201d is used for patients who de-velop clinical features of pericarditis after being stabilized on dialysis usually after 8 weeks of its initiation (Barach, 1922).Though several therapeutic modalities have been used to treat uremic and dialysis pericarditis and pericar-dial effusion, initial treatment of pericarditis is usually de-termined by the hemodynamic stability of the patient. In azotemic patients pericarditis is due to number of causes including infection, diseases like systemic lupus erythro-matosis (SLE), or to uremic toxins itself. The incidence of acute pericardial disease punctuating chronic renal fail-ure is decreasing because of effective dialysis and renal transplantation; approximately 20% of uremic patients re-quiring chronic dialysis develop pericarditis.It is surpris-ing that even though pericardial involvement remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patientswith end stage renal disease (ESRD), the academic interest and the literature regarding the same has reduced over the past few years. During 1995 and 1998, less than 1% of the 650 authors discussing pericarditis were specifically related to uremic pericarditis uremia one of main complications in patients with terminal chronic kidney insufficiency is ure-mic pericarditis which usually is presented as acute uremic pericarditis but sometimes it can be chronic constrictive pericarditis with pericardial effusions.Uremic pericarditis is caused from renal insufficien-cy either acute or chronic as result of inflammation of vis-ceral and parietal layers by uremic toxin and disorders of urea and creatinine metabolism which are highly elevated in uremic patients.  Uremic patients treated with hemodi-alysis can develop chonstrictive uremic pericarditis. Defin-itive cause of uremic pericarditis is still unknown. Many studies have documented that the onset of uremic pericar-ditis in uremic patients treated with HD is result of termi-nal renal disease and inadequate Hemodialysis(HD) ses-sions where enough amounts of fluid are not eliminated, volemic overload with secondary hyper-tension and over-weight between HD intervals. Some authors suggest that uremic pericarditis can be result of retention of uremic tox-ins in organism.Symptoms are pain pericarditis uremic presented with different intensity, which is alleviated when the patient is sitting or leaning forward. Clinical signs of pericarditis in patients with renal disease terminals (ESRD treat my chronic hemodialysis are similar to signs observed from other causes. Most patients complain of fever and pain pleural chest, the intensity of which is very different. the pain is localized in the region pericardial and may resemble the pain of angina pectoris. When developing effusionmas-sivepericardial may also appear dyspnea and heart failure.

These is nonsystolic and diastolic and performances and typically three compo-nents of their appearance. When added effusion pericardi-al (the liquid) noise friction pericardial often disappear.Ef-fusion pericarditis jugular veins cause strain (Kussmaul\u2019s sign-t) and can develop a paradoxical pulse (decrease of systolic pressure in inspiration). However, although there are documented facts that all patients with terminal renal disease treated me with recurrent pericarditis chronic he-modialysis may not manifest symptoms. In suspected cas-es of pericarditis, echocardiography should be done first so that Chiara\u2019s effusion pericardial highlights.Aim of this paper is to verify and document the im-pact of terminal chronic kidney insufficiency and the im-pact from HD on the onset of pericarditis and its complica-tions. Etiology of different types of pericarditis in patients with different diseases (cardiovascular, respiratory, infec-tious etc.) have been studied thoroughly except for man-ifestations and etiology of pericarditis in uremic patients treated with HD where not enough studies have been made therefore its etiology is still not definitely known. There-fore more and larger studies need to be made with more patients so the exact cause of this phenomenon with le-thal consequences in uremic patients treated with HD can be found. Materials and methodsIn this clinical prospective observational study were analyzed 90 patients with terminal chronic kid-ney insufficiency treated with HD in Clinical Hospital of Tetovo on Department of Nephrology with mean age 62.40\u00b15.20 identical for both genders. Initial evaluation in-cludes a clinical history and physical examination, ECG, echocardiography(3D color Doppler) chest radiography, and lab studies.ECG can be diagnostic in acute pericardi-tis and typically shows ST elevation in all leads. The ratio of the amplitude of ST segment to the amplitude of the T wave in leads I, V4, V5, and V6 on electrocardiogram can be used to differentiate acute pericarditis (AP) from ear-ly repolarization (ER) and early repolarization of left ven-tricular hypertrophy (ERLVH), according to a recent study. Statistical elaborationThe basic statistical methods used in this study were: arithmetical average value, standard deviation X\u00b1SD, Stu-dent \u201ct\u201d test, Mann Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test. The sta-tistical significance of the differences between subjects of the experimented group and control group for the gained parameters  was analyzed with \u201cAnova Two Factor \u201d with statistical value for ,,p\u201d smallearthen 1% ( p<0.0001).Results and discussionFrom 90 patients treated with HD, 30 patients (10 females, 20 males) showed symptoms of chest pain and tightening similar to pectoral angina (in small number of patients persistent temperature accompanied with fever was found). All patients who presented with symptoms of uremic pericarditis had fluid overload (between HD inter-vals) of 4000-6000ml.ConclusionIn our work we verified that in 30% of examined pa-tients predominate symptoms of uremic pericarditis, from those: in 25% pericarditis was caused as inadequate HD treatment, fluid overload between HD intervals, dietetic-hygienic disrespect of HD, termination of HD s\u00e9ance be-fore required, disuse of antihypertensive and diuretic ther-apy (in 10% of patients with two weekly sessions of HD from 4 to 5 hours per s\u00e9ance), while in 5% of patients peri-carditis was consequence of various infections. The hemo-dialysis patients also used the supp. Indomethacin, aspirin, corticotherapy and broad spectrum antibiotic. ReferencesBright, R.,1836.

One of the risk indicators of cardiovascu-lar factors considering this group of patients is Arterial hy-pertension (AH). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibi-tors (ACE) are the most effective group of drugs used for the treatment of hypertension in patients with CRI (Brown et al., 1998)  and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), based on the prevention of renal and CVD damages. ACE in-hibitors are used primarily for the aforementioned diseas-es due to their effectiveness in slowing down the pace of progress and reducing the rate of morbidity and mortali-ty in patients with these diseases. A large number of stud-ies have been published where they show the positive ef-fects of ACE inhibitors. These drugs remain further as the most preferred drugs in the treatment of patients with CRI and AH. AH and lipid abnormalities are among the most important causes that accelerate the progression of chron-ic renal disease (CRD) and the risk of CVD. The etiology of arterial hypertension is a multifactorial (near 20-25% of cases with AH the etiology is known, while other cases are due to many other disorders: hormonal, renal, cardiac, in-fectious, congenital diseases or inherited, different urop-struksionet, RVU (Reflux Vesico Uretral) etc. AH remains one most important and common factor of diseases throughout the world. Between normotension and hypetension pressure not any precise definition per-sists, but based on the preferences and the World Health Organization all the values of systolic pressure higher than 140 mmHg and diastolic higher than 90 mmHg are treated as arterial hypertension. Recent years, a number of studies have verified and documented that between AH and lipid abnormalities and progress of CKD (Chronic Kidney Dis-ease) there is a high positive correlation. There are facts documented that patients with CKD and other consequenc-es besides AH, a large number of them suffer from a hip-ertregliceridemia and dyslipidemia, so it is very necessary examination, treatment, determination and correlation of lipids with AH, that in the initial stages of CRD with the sole purpose of preventing rapid pace of progress towards CRD uremia. Many contemporary studies testify a close connection between pressure and uremic dyslipidemia ver-ifying that the AH with its oscillations significantly af-fect lipid disorder helping their stratification on the wall of blood vessels, thus increasing the risk of aterogenesis of coronary arteries, cerbrale with frequent manifestations of acute myocardial infarction. Materials and methodsIn the study 240 subjects were included (of which 140 male and 100 female respectively. The average age was 56.80 \u00b1 12.50 years.  The first group of 120 patients (50 fe-male and 70 male) were treated over 12 months with the ACE inhibitor and the second group (50 female and 70 male) were treated with Angiotensin II AT1 receptor block-ers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The patients were examined before and after the study. The examina-tion was carried out for the analysis of proteinuria, serum urea, serum creatinine, uric acid electrolytes, profile of lip-id and determination of the level of glomerular filtration S6 PP 284594Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 593 - 594 (2016)Clinical pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular sciencesPoster presentationsrate (GFR glomerular filtration Rate by Cockroft & Gault formula) before and after the therapy. The method used is standard deviation \u00b1 SD, two factor ANOVA.Results and discussionFrom the results obtained the blood pressure of the pa-tients was lower in both treated groups, though statistical-ly not significant. When comparing the groups treated with ACE inhibitors and the group treated with different group of medicines respectively there was statistically signifi-cant difference <0.005 for the concentrations of urea, cre-atinine, uric acid and with a stagnation of GFR in favor of the group that was treated with ACE inhibitors for over 12 months.ConclusionMany contemporary studies testify a close connection between pressure and uremic dyslipidemia verifying that the AH with its oscillations significantly affect lipid dis-order helping their stratification on the wall of blood ves-sels, thus increasing the risk of aterogenesis of coronary arteries,  cerebral with frequent manifestations of acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, angi-na pectoris, heart failure congestive and cerebrovascular brain stroke (Antony et al., 1996). Common effects of AH and hyperlipidemia manifestly affect modification and re-duce in renal functions causing nefroangiosklerosis with glomerulosclerosis. It is estimated that 10-13% of elderly patients in the US suffer from CKD and AH without taking to account the degree of CRD. AH during CRF is volumic type (with manifestations of cardiovascular complications with hypertensive cardiomyopathy etc. and despite that sometimes it may be as a result of other mechanisms like hipernatremia etc. Although more research needs to be car-ried out, our results suggest that ACE inhibitors, regardless of their antihypertensive effects, can reduce and slow down significantly the rate of chronic renal failure and cardiovas-cular diseases (Weiner et al., 2007). Inadequate treatment of HTA in patients with CRI symptoms will lead to risk of CVD and an increase in renal diseases. ReferencesAntony, I., Lerebours, G., Nitenberg, A., 1996.

In this study we wanted to display the apolipoproteinic abnor-malities in patients with RA, their correlation and how RA causes changes of apolipoproteinic profile.  RA is system-ic disease of connective tissue (Boers et al., 2003; Dessein et al., 2006; Park et al., 1999; Gonzalez-Gay et al., 2005) with unknown ethiology, subacute or chronic with exacer-bations and remissions, most commonly found in peryphe-rial joints, symetrically, which with time can cause destruc-tion, deformities and at the end ankylosis of joints. It is known fact that patients with RA are more prone to differ-ent inflamations which is confirmed from the fact that these patients have higher concentrations of C-Reactive Prote-ine, a biomarker who suggest the presence of inflamma-tion who when is combined with apolipoproteinic abnor-malities is count as additional factor on the onset of athero-sclerotic changes of coronary and cerebrovascular arteries, with early onset of atherosclerosis in patients with RA. Aim of studyPrimary aim of this study is to show apolipoprotein-ic abnormalities and the concentrations of CPR in patients with RA, and their role on the progress of RA and their ath-erogenic effect on coronary, cerebrovacular and peripheri-al artheries. Matherial and methods  In this cross-section study a total of 40 patients were included, from whom 24 were females with mean age of 48.0\u00b118.6 and 16 males with mean age of 49.5\u00b112.8, with verified diagnosis of RA according to criteria of Ameri-can Association for Rheumatoid Arthritis of 1987. Control group was composed from 40 healthy individuals (voulen-tary blood donors)   from whom 24 females and 16 males. In all patients (examined group and control group) beside routine analysis for lipid profile other analysis were made as well: total lipids (TL), total cholesterol (TCh), triglyc-erides (TG), HDL-ch,LDL-ch,ApolipoproteinA-1,Apo-B100, Apo-E, Lp(a)CRO and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) lev-els too.Results and discussionOur study confirmed that patients with RA are prone to have increased levels of: TL=8.20\u00b12.70mmol/l;TCh=6.8\u00b12.70mmol/l;TG=3.46\u00b10.65 mmol/l; and LDL-ch=4.48\u00b10.90 mmol/l whereas HDL levels were de-creaed HDL-ch= 0.94 \u00b1 0.60 mmol/l. From analysis of apolipoproteins we found low concentrations of Apo-A1=0.94\u00b10.12 g/l  and high concentrations of  ApoB100= 2.98\u00b11.85 g/l; Apo-E=6.50\u00b11.70 g/l , Lp(a)=48.0\u00b118.60, and CRP=18.0\u00b1 6.80 mg/l  in contranst from the control group results: TL= 6.20\u00b10.50 mmol/l; TCh =4,30\u00b10.60 mmol/l; TG=1.24\u00b10.70 mmol/l; HDL-ch= 1.28\u00b10.40 and LDL-ch=2.90\u00b10.90 mmol/l, and CRP= 4  mg/l. Lipopro-tein lipase levels in patients with RA in our study showed low levels:LPL-12.80\u00b14.20 u/L comparing with the control group LPL- 24.80\u00b112.00 u/L. Decreased activity of LPL is believed to be result of increased concentrations of cyto-S6 PP 285596Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 595 - 596 (2016)Clinical pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular sciencesPoster presentationscines: Interleukin 1, Interleukin 1\u03b2, Interleukin 1\u03b1, Inter-leukin 2,Interleukin 6, Interleukin 8, Interleukin 10, Inter-leukin 12 and Tumor Necrosis Factor. Disturbed apolipo-proteinic profile, proinflamatory cytokines and increased levels of CRP are fact that patients with RA are prone to increased risk for atherosclerotic changes in blood ves-sels, with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, cere-brovascular events, peripheric artherial disease and onset of early (premature) atheros-clerosis (atherosclerosis prae-cox). ConclusionIt can be concluded that measuring lipidic and apoli-poproteinic abnormalities in RA patients can help to take hygienic-dietetic measures as well as treatment methods which significantly would decrease prevalence of dyslip-idemia and would also slow down the atherogenesis which would reduce in minimum the onset of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, atherosclerotic macroarteriopathy and early atherosclerosis in patients with RA. Management of lipid abnormalities in patients with RA aims to normalize the atherogenic index (TCh/HDLch) with statines, fibrates, nyacine, cholestipol, cholestyramine or combined therapy, also prevention of inflamatory processes.ReferencesBoers, M., Nurmohamed, M.T., Doelman, C.J.A., Lard, L.R., Verhoeven, A.C., Voskuyl, A.E.,  Huizinga, T.W., van de Stadt, R.J., Dijkmans, B.A., van der Linden, S., 2003.

Ul. D. Cara bb, 1200 Tetovo, Republic of Macedonia* dr-luti@hotmail.comIntroductionOne of chronic disorders of terminal renal failure is also a metabolic disorder of L-Carnitines. L-carnitine in the body acts as an antioxidant fighting the harmful par-ticles in the body known as free radicals, which dam-age the DNA and excite it. The lower concentration of L-carnitine(L-c) in patients treated with hemodialysis (HD) is a consequence of the loss of it through dialisant (Clut-terbuck at al., 2002; Fornasini et al., 2007) digestion and reduce endogenous synthesis as a result of absence of the precursor (predecessor) amino acid Lisine. In the kidney, osmolytes including carnitine are crucial since hyperto-nicity is usual and the kidney must cope with fluctuations of diuresis (increased production of urine) and antidirue-sis. Extracellular osmolarity of medullary cells may be-come more than four-fold that of isotonicity. In healthy in-dividuals, carnitine is freely filtered and tubular resorption of free carnitine (FC) is almost complete. What is excret-ed in urine is carnitine ester, or acylcarnitine (AC).   In healthy people, the renal clearance of AC is four to eight times that of FC.Impairment of excretion of AC occurs with deteriorating renal function leading to decreased car-nitine clearance and resulting in elevated plasma levels of carnitine.Uremic patients have elevated levels of AC that occur as both elevated FC and total carnitine before (Ar-duini et al., 2006). Due to accumulation of metabolic in-termediates, impaired carnitine biosynthesis, reduced pro-tein intake, and increased removal of carnitine through he-modialysis (HD), patients who undergo routine HD usu-ally present with plasma carnitine. (Cibulka et al., 2005) There are documented facts that the plasma levels of L-C at the end of each dialysis session slimmed down to about 70-80% on average.  This reduction in plasma levels of L-carnitine  affter HD is a consequence of epoetin-resis-tant anemia, intradyalitic hypotension,cardiomyopathy, fa-ti-gue,muscle weakness, of various inflammation, reduced endogenous synthesis of cofactors of L-Carnitines and malnutrition. L-Carnitines affects remodeling of phospho-lipidic membrane of red blood cells, stimulates erythropoi-esis in high concentrations>200 \u03bcmol/L, increases surviv-al time of red blood cells, redu-ces oxidative stress through the hem oxygenasis-1, and It reduces inflammation, and re-duces the value of C-reactive protein (PCR) and lipids. A large number of observers have documented studies of an inverse correlation between the dose of rHuEPO and car-nitine level. Randomized and controlled studies in a meta-analysis suggest that supplementation with L-Carnitines  has shown positive effects in response to therapy with Erythropoie-tin in chronic uremic patients treated with HD. Uremic pa-tients treated with HD due to low values of L-C often man-ifest anemia resistant to therapy with human Eritropoet-in Recombinant (rHuEpo) with substitution with L-Carni-tines significantly reduces the resis-tence to therapy with rHuEpo, with K/DOQI association recent years suggests that patients treated with chronic HD and resistant to ther-apy by the end of the session with HD must necessarily be treated with L-Carnitine (KDOQI Clinical Practice guide-lines 2008-2009). Aim of this paper was to show the effects of L-Carnitine in uremic patients treated with HD.S6 PP 286598Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 597 - 598 (2016)Clinical pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular sciencesPoster presentationsMaterials and methodsIn total 100 patients treated with chronic HD were studied. Of the 100 patients treated with HD-46 (45%) were female- 54 (55%) were male, with an average iden-tical age of 58.70\u00b112.60, treated over 8 years in Tetovo Clinical Hospital and Clinic Skopje. Patients were divid-ed into two groups: The first group comprised of 65 pa-tients  had a sensitive reaction to therapy with rHuEpo dose of 2000-4000 IU after  HD  subcutaneous and the second group consisted of 11 women and 12 men who after  HD had the highest value carnitine clearence on even after in-creasing the dose showed a  resistance to therapy after 6-8 weeks and we decided that this patients to be trea-ted with L-C ampoules of 1 g after each session of HD and 2x500 mg L-C in the form tablets days that have not HD. With-in 8 months of this dose, we have seen a rapid increase in the level of carnitines, reaching levels two to three times higher than the concentration of physiological L-C and high impact to eritropoesis and stimulation of erythroblasts (11,12) as well as positive effects on therapy with rHuEpo which was manifested with adjustment of blood (Er, Hb, Htc) and improvement of symptoms of renal anemia . Our study confirms the elimination of L-C of 16.80 \u00b1 28.40% over a period of 8-12 months of treatment with HD.Results and discussionBefore starting the Epo therapy mean values of Hb in-female patients were 5.20\u00b11.15 mmol / l, while in males were=5.60\u00b11.10 mmol/l, the number of Er in female was:2.90\u00b1 0.86 x 10 12 / l, while in males were=3.20\u00b1 0.90 x 10 12/l. Values of HTC in female were=0:24 \u00b1 0:04 while the men-12:28\u00b112:06. After treatment with EPO therapy and amp. L-Carnitine a 1.0 g intravenously at the end of the session that the HD the desired target Hb was > 6.80 mmol / l and after 16 weeks the women target was Hb> 6:40 mmol/l, while the male target Hb>6.85 mmol/l, the Er number of female reached: 3.60\u00b10.80x10 12 / l, while in the male were 3.85\u00b10.80x1012 /l. The values of Htc in the female came up-0.32\u00b1 0.03 while the men-0.04\u00b1 0.35. The comparison of values of patients before treatment with L-carnitine and Epo therapy and after treatment showed a sig-nificant statistical difference of p <0.0001. Statistical pro-cessing: statistical methods that were used are: arithmetic mean value, standard deviation: X \u00b1 SD, Studentov,,t\u201dtest, Mann-Withney U test,Annova Two-Factor. The results ob-tained from the examination of Hb, Er, Htc are processed and presented in the form of charts, tables and diagrams..ConclusionWe can conclude that patients undernourished, anemic and resistent to therapy with rHuEpo and lower values of the concentrations of L-C after the session with HD, sup-ple-mentation with carnitine (per os or ampular) can im-prove reanale anemia significantl resistant to Epo therapy. Our findings confirm that elimination of L-carnitines after application of L-C in HD decrease from 16.80 \u00b128.40% .But are necessary further studies with larger number of pa-tients with longer duration so that can be documented and verified the effects of L-carnitine to uremic patients and re-sistant to Epo therapy.

BMC is a mode of micellar liq-uid chromatography that uses micellar mobile phases of Brij35 under adequate experimental conditions. It can be useful in mimicking the drug partitioning process into bi-ological systems, because the characteristics of BMC sys-tem are similar to biological barriers and extracellular flu-ids (Molero-Monfort et al., 2000). On the other hand clas-sical reversed phased HPLC system is recognized as the well-established system for estimation of compounds lipo-philicity. The important role of lipophilicity and its use in prediction of blood-brain permeability of drugs have been demonstrated in several studies (Kaliszan, 2007). Reten-tion data obtained by this method can be further used in correlation studies with some physicochemical and bio-logical properties of tested compounds (Liu et al., 2011). The compounds examined in this study were imidazoline receptor ligands (IRs) (Ernsberger, 2000). IRs have been tested as novel centrally acting antihypertensives and drug candidates for treatment of various neurological disorders (Fenton et al., 2006; Finn et al., 2003). Since these ligands exhibit additional CNS effects, several structurally relat-ed CNS drugs were also included in this research. In this work, the retention data of 16 imidazoline/\u03b1-adrenergic re-ceptor ligands and 15 CNS drugs, were examined using BMC and RP-HPLC systems and correlated with permea-bility coefficients (Pe) previously obtained in our laborato-ry using PAMPA (Vucicevic et al., 2015). Materials and methodsChromatographic conditionsChromatographic analysis was carried out on an Agi-lent Technologies 1200 Series system   (Santa Clara, CA, USA). BMC analyses were performed on a Zorbax Ex-tend-C18 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, particle size 5 \u03bcm), with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a temperature of 36.5 \u00b0C. Micellar mobile phase was prepared by dissolving poly-oxyethylene (23) lauryl ether Brij 35 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich Che-mie Gmbh, Steinheim, Germany) in buffered solution at pH 7.40 (which corresponds to blood pH of humans) to get a final surfactant concentration of 0.04 M. RP-HPLC mea-surements were performed using a XTerra\u00ae RP18 column (100 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, particle size 3.5 \u03bcm). The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, column temperature was set to 25 \u00b0C. Mo-bile phase was consisted of different ratios of methanol and sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 7.40).Computational methodThe Quantitative Structure-Permeability Relationship (QSPR) models were developed using retention data from BMC system. PLS regression analysis was performed us-ing the Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy SIM-CA P+ 12.0 program (Umetrics AB, 2008), while STATIS-TICA 5.0 (StatSoft Inc., 1998) was used for the stepwise MLR and ANN analysis.

The geometry of all compounds have been minimized us-ing B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) (Becke, 1993; Lee et al., 1988) included in ChemBio3D Ultra 13.0 program (CambridgeSoft Corpora-tion, 2013). Constitutional, geometrical, physicochemical and electronical parameters of optimized molecular struc-tures were calculated using following software: ChemBi-o3D Ultra 13.0, Dragon 6.0 (Talete srl, 2010) and ADMET Predictor 6.5. Additionally, HOMO and LUMO energies obtained using ChemBio3D Ultra 13.0 were used to cal-culate some quantum chemically based reactivity molecu-lar parameters, such as chemical potential (l), electronega-tivity (v), hardness (g), global softness (S) and electrophi-licity index (x) (Iczkowski and Margrave, 1961; Parr and Yang, 1989). Results and discussionUsing ADMET predictor 6.5 (Simulation Plus, Inc., 2013) and ACD/i-Lab software (http://www.acdlabs.com/resources/ilab/) it was shown that those compounds are not substrates Pgp and their BBB-permeability could be ac-curately predicted by using non-cellular in vitro methods. Significant correlation was obtained between logarithm of BMC retention factor (logkBMC) and effective permeabil-ity (Pe) (R2=0.69), while for RP-HPLC system the corre-lation was lower (R2 logkwRP-HPLC / Pe = 0.49). There-fore it can be concluded that logkBMC parameter could be used as more reliable than logkwRP-HPLC to assess the BBB penetration of IRs/\u03b1-ARs ligands and CNS drugs in more time efficient manner. Further, retention factors (logkBMC) of \u03b1-adrenergic/imidazoline receptor ligands and CNS drugs were used as dependent (Y) variable in this QSPR studies, while their calculated molecular de-scriptors were selected as independent (X) variables. Par-tial Least Square (PLS) regression, stepwise Multiple Lin-ear Regression (stepwise MLR), and Artificial Neural Net-works (ANN) techniques were applied in order to create new mathematical models. Stepwise MLR analysis have been resulted in statisticaly better performance than PLS and ANN, and therefore MLR/QSPR-logkBMC model was selected as an optimal. The P_VSA_s_5, VE1_RG, P_VSA_p_2 and GATS1e were selected descriptors with the most significant influence on logkBMC and consequent-ly on Pe, indicating on possible structural modifications which could enhance BBB penetration. ConclusionFormed models could be used as time and cost effi-cient screening tool for evaluation of blood-brain barrier permeation of novel \u03b1-adrenergic/imidazoline receptor li-gands, as promising drug candidates for treatment of hy-pertension or neurological diseases.

It is the professional activity in which the phar-macist, using his knowledge and experience, revealing pa-tients\u2019 needs, set priorities in the treatment process, and takes responsibility for a positive outcome of drug thera-py (Hepler and Strand, 1989). That responsibility is shared with the doctor who determined the diagnosis and pre-scribed therapy, and with patients, encouraging them to the compliance, frequent check and counseling about respon-sible treatment. Today, many countries are trying to incor-porate this new concept in its health care system, and al-though such attempts are of great interest to national and international pharmacy organizations, many challenges of-ten appear in the implementation of this concept. Some of the difficulties may include: attitudes and opinions of other health professionals, lack of cooperation, and inadequate communication between them, an insufficient number of pharmacists, space or equipment for the provision of phar-maceutical care, including the structure and organization of health care (EDQM, 2012). Pharmaceutical care derives from the principles and postulates of clinical pharmacy, which pharmacists recog-nize as the scientific basis for intervention in the treatment of patients (RPSGB, 2007). The concept of clinical phar-macy clarifies the role of the pharmacist in the process of providing health care. It involves different ways of cooper-ation of health professionals in which science and practice can be linked to patient care. But to make this impact had the biggest impact possible, it is necessary to develop clin-ical knowledge, but also communication skills, judgment and decision- making. Clinical practice should occupy an increasing role in the daily work of a pharmacist, instead of being just one of the possible options or specialty phar-macist. Clinical pharmacy practice means and includes the philosophy of pharmaceutical care that is focused on spe-cialized knowledge and experience in the treatment. As a scientific discipline, clinical pharmacy includes the task of collecting and contributing to the creation of new knowl-edge that can improve the health and quality of life (Mc-Givney et al., 2007).Indicators of quality of pharmaceutical care are equal-ly appropriate for in-patient and community settings, for hospital and community pharmacists, and other health-care professionals, as applicable, in low-, middle-income and industrialized countries in Europe and other regions of the world. The indicators provide information about the range; quantity and quality of pharmaceutical care inter-ventions/services delivered. The indicators also provide an opportunity to gather in-depth knowledge on pharmaceu-tical care practices regionally, nationally, and internation-ally that will permit the sharing and follow-up of experi-ences over time by professional disciplines and the health sector in general, regionally, nationally and international-ly. These indicators are rather broad, and can be further de-veloped and refined over time, but they are easily under-stood and will help pharmacists, other healthcare provid-ers, and professional regulators to formalize and develop the pharmaceutical care philosophy and its working meth-ods (EDQM, 2012).Some of the terms, which are used in Indicators of quality, are:1. Adverse drug reaction (ADR) means a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended and which occurs at doses normal-ly used in man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease or for the restoration, correc-tion or modification of physiological functionS7 OP 288604Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 603 - 604 (2016)Oral presentationsContinuing professional development2. Documentation \u2013 the detailed description of a patient-provider or provider-provider interac-tion. Documentation serves as a record for stat-ing relevant participants, evidence, assumption, rationale, and analytical methods used in eval-uating patient progress and quality of care or outcomes for individuals. Also functions as a means of communication among providers and analysis for billing purposes. 3. Customer loyalty - expresses an intended be-havior related to the product or service. This in-cludes the likelihood of future purchases or re-newal of service contracts or, conversely, how likely it is that the customer will switch to an-other brand or service provider.4. Follow up is maintenance of contact with or re-examination of a person (as a patient) at usu-ally prescribed intervals following diagnosis or treatment 5. Medication review is an evaluation of patient\u2018s medicines with the aim of optimizing the out-come of medicine therapy by detecting, solving and preventing drug-related problems 6. Interprofessional collaboration \u2013 working to-gether with one or more health care profession-als who each make a unique contribution to ob-tain optimal patient medication outcomes, con-sidering patient needs, expectations, and quali-ty of life 7. Patient Medication Profile \u2013 is a comprehensive summary of all regular medicines taken by the patient. Professional assessment of prescription is the assess-ment of whether the prescription includes an appropri-ate dosage form and appropriate route of administration; appropriateness according to patient\u2019s condition; dosage within therapeutic range; duration of treatment; appropri-ateness according to patient\u2019s parameters (age, weight, etc.) and previous medication; compatibility with other medica-tion; consistency with formularies, clinical guidelines and protocols; possible side effects; risk of adverse drug reac-tions; potential for non-concordance, inappropriate use and misuse by patient; contraindications (RPSGB, 2007).Pharmaceutical care is the responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite out-comes that improve a patient\u2019s quality of life. These out-comes are:\u2022\t Cure of a disease\u2022\t Elimination or reduction of a patients\u2019 symp-tomatology\u2022\t Arresting or slowing of a disease process\u2022\t Preventing a disease or symptomatologyPharmaceutical care involves the process that a phar-macist co-operates with the patient and healthcare pro-fessionals in designing, implementing, and monitoring a therapeutic plan that will produce specific therapeutic out-comes for the patient. This in turn involves three major functions:\u2022\t Identifying potential and actual drug-related problems\u2022\t Resolving actual drug-related problems and \u2022\t Preventing drug-related problems.Pharmaceutical care is a necessary element of health care, and should be integrated with other elements (Mc-Givney et al., 2007).Pharmaceutical care is, however, provided for the di-rect benefit to the patient, and the pharmacist is responsible directly to the patient for the quality of that care. The fun-damental relationship in pharmaceutical care is a mutually beneficial exchange in which the patient grants authority to the provider and the provider gives competence and com-mitment (accept responsibility) to the patient. These funda-mental goals, processes, and relationships of pharmaceuti-cal care exist regardless of practice setting and of profes-sional background (Hepler and Strand, 1989).ReferencesHepler, D.D., Strand, L.M., 1989.

Macedonia* bistra_anglovska@yahoo.comLegal frameworkPharmaceutical Chamber of Macedonia (Chamber) as a professional association of pharmacists with high educa-tion, beside public authorizations for issuing, continuing, renewing and revoking of working licenses and keeping registers, with the adoption of the Law on Health Care Pro-tection in 2012 has obtained one more public authorization \u2013 professional supervision (LHP, 2012). According to this Law, supervision of the professional work of the health-care institutions and other institutions that perform health-care activities and of the healthcare workers and co-work-ers is being performed for the purpose of control of the professional work, the implementation of the professional guidelines, assessment of the professional work, as well as assessment of the conditions and the manner of provided healthcare (LHP, 2012). The final goal of the profession-al supervision is evaluation of the quality of the healthcare services provided by the healthcare workers, in this case pharmacists, and undertaking measures for their improve-ment. The quality of provided services by the pharmacists, as well as the conditions under they are provided have in-valuable significance for the provision of pharmaceutical activities as a part of the whole health care protection, care for the patients, prevention of the diseases and obtainment health for the population. The Chamber has fully recog-nized the aims and the goals of the professional supervi-sion, the need for determining the provision, quantity and sustainability of the quality of the healthcare services re-spectively, as well as determining the conditions for per-forming the supervision and their maintenance at the re-quired level according to the current legal provisions.Creating basis for implementation and developing acts and toolsThe implementation of the professional supervision as a new public authorization in the Chamber started with forming a Commission for organizing the professional su-pervision with duties: to make proposed list of pharmacists \u2013 providers of the supervision, to develop criteria for per-forming professional supervision, to propose annual plan for conducting professional supervision, to keep evidence of performed supervisions and suggested and taken mea-sures for improvement, to write annual reports, to give re-ports of performed supervisions to the Ministry of Health, to make orders for performing the supervision, to deter-mine performers for supervision, all according to the Law, the Statute of the Chamber and the Code of Ethics (Rule-book, 2014). During the 2013, the Commission for professional su-pervision created a Rulebook on the performing the profes-sional supervision, which later was adopted by the Cham-ber\u2019s Assembly and published in the Official Gazette of R. Macedonia (Rulebook, 2014).  In the Rulebook are de-termined the way of organizing the professional supervi-sion and the procedures for performing according to the legal provisions. The conducted supervision can be reg-ular supervision or professional supervision when neces-sary \u2013 extraordinary professional supervision (LHP, 2012). Regular supervision is conducted according to the annu-al plan, set by the Commission and adopted by the Execu-tive Board of the Chamber (LHP, 2012). The extraordinary supervision is carried out in the case of a request for ex-amination the operation of the health care facility and the work of the pharmacists during the provision of the phar-maceutical services (LHP, 2012). The request can be sub-mitted by patient, member of the patient\u2019s family and gov-ernmental body (LHP, 2012). The professional supervision S7 OP 289606Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 605 - 606 (2016)Oral presentationsContinuing professional developmentis conducted by the performers, who fulfill certain crite-ria such as (1) having specialization in the certain field of pharmacy or master degree, at least 5 years working ex-perience in appropriate health care institution and valid li-cense to work, or (2) having at least 10 years working ex-perience in appropriate healthcare institution and valid li-cense to work (Rulebook, 2014). During the profession-al supervision performers examine, evaluated and control the organization and the management of the work in the healthcare institution, the manner of work of the healthcare institution, professional qualifications of the pharmacists, the rights and the obligations of the pharmacists, profes-sional work of the pharmacists, their continuing education, keeping official books and registers and provision of the legal requirements and professional guidelines (Rulebook, 2014). After completing the professional supervision, per-formers prepare minutes, which is submitted to the Com-mission. Commission further submits report to the Minis-try of Health (LHP, 2012). If the performers determine ir-regularity in the work, they are obliged to give directions for eliminating the irregularity (Rulebook, 2014). They are also obliged to give instructions for improvement if need-ed. If pharmacists and the pharmacy don\u2019t carry out the in-structions within the period laid down by the performers, then the Commission shall notify the competent authorities and bodies of the Chamber (Rulebook, 2014).Furthermore, the Chamber announced call for selec-tion of providers of professional supervision. After the per-formers\u2019 selections was completed, lists of providers of the professional supervisions for community pharmacy, hos-pital and clinical pharmacy, laboratories and other health care providers where pharmacists work were formed.It was also decided professional supervision to start to be conducted in community pharmacies, and then to cover other healthcare institutions. Because of fair, efficient and quality delivery of pro-fessional supervision the Commission has prepared List of indicators for the implementation of professional supervi-sion over the work of community pharmacies and pharma-cists who work in them. The List is a helpful tool to facil-itate the conduction of the professional supervision with-out subjective influence on performers. The List is struc-tured form of statements that determine certain obligation, criteria, condition or process needed to establish the quali-ty of the provided healthcare services by the pharmacists as well as the conditions in which those services are provided.Performing and initial resultsProfessional supervision began to be implemented in the second half of 2014. At the beginning was conducted on 8 pharmacists employed in 6 pharmacies on the territory of Skopje. The next year, were conducted 28 supervisions on pharmacists employed in 19 pharmacies in 9 communi-ties in Skopje. In all performed supervisions it was found that the healthcare workers \u2013 pharmacists work profession-ally, respect legal requirements, educate continuously, re-spect patients\u2019 rights and confidentiality of the data, com-municate with other healthcare workers, take care of the environment where they work, equipment and inventory. It was also determined that there were not irregularities in the overall work of the pharmacies as healthcare institutions. The condition settled in performed professional supervi-sions indicates several facts. Most of the pharmacies don\u2019t produce magistral preparations. They order them from oth-er legal entities \u2013 galenic laboratories. Most of them have contract with Health Insurance Fund, and only for the med-icines that are reimbursed they obligatory keep electronic record for the patients. Only 2 pharmacies have Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the most of the processes performed in the pharmacy. In the supervised pharmacies, no one from the pharmacists has reported adverse reaction in the National center for reporting adverse reactions. No one at the pharmacies keeps evidence for shortages of the medicines. The performers of the supervision in individu-al cases have given instructions and guidelines, for exam-ple, haw to improve area for dissolving syrups, which data to be put in the electronic records, development and imple-mentation of SOPs for individual processes in pharmacy, conflict management and else. Professional supervision is being performed in 2016 according to the Plan for the current year.Future developments and expectationsIn the future, the Chamber regarding the public autho-rization \u2013 professional supervision aims: to increase the number of the performers to be able to carry out more su-pervisions simultaneously on the territory of Macedonia, to develop lists of indicators for other healthcare institu-tions where pharmacists work and to begin to conduct pro-fessional supervisionReferencesLHP (Law on Healthcare Protection), 2012.

Unfortunately, in practice, prescribers are often obliged to deviate from granted medicine marketing authorisation, due to the lack of availability of appropriate medicines for patient\u2019s thera-peutic needs and progress. This concept of medicines use not mentioned in the approved labelling (FDA Modern-ization Act) or outside of the terms of Summary of Prod-uct Characteristics regarding indication, age, dosage, phar-maceutical form and route of administration (British NHS Guideline) is defined as off-label use of licensed medicines.On the global level, many supportive  evidence and health care needs confirm that off-label medicines use occurs in every country and each level or specialty area of  healthcare (Conroy, 2003). Moreover, it is an integral part of  Good Medical Practice and may provide the best available option or even the standard of care in a particu-lar health condition (Dresser and Frader, 2009). In general, this concept is legal and may be appropriate, but it can be associated with safety, clinical and ethical concerns, em-phasizing the increased incidence of adverse events associ-ated with off-label medicines uses in particularly vulnera-ble patient groups (Gazarian and Kelly, 2006). A concerning issue is that the majority of all off-la-bel uses have limited to no scientific support (Radley et al., 2006) and a considerable number of prescribers have no or limited knowledge about off-label medicine use or do not meet regulations regarding off-label use, if they exist. (Pi-\u00f1eiro P\u00e9rez et al., 2014). Experience shows that to ensure the quality of off-la-bel use of medicines, there should be a formal mechanism to assess the feasibility, monitoring the safety and efficien-cy of medication used based on this concept.Thus, in con-tinuum, the off-label use of medicines has been an essen-tial part of the ethical and legal considerations as well as, many regulatory initiatives. The overall objective is to present a model regulatory framework setting out guidelines and recommendations for quality use of off-label medicines within the national pro-file of health care policy. A literature search was undertaken to identify the is-sues and challenges related to off-label medicines use in-cluding clinical, safety and ethical concerns. Recommendations for model framework Principles of good practice for off-label use of med-icines should include the following elements: identifying the medical needs; compilation of a consensus list of ac-cepted, scientific based off-label uses; creating an official expert group for the evaluation and approval of specific off-label uses; and, providing a safe and effective supply. The main guiding principles and developed activities to sup-port a responsible decision-making with regard to off-la-bel medicines include: 1) the medical need- the best avail-S7 OP 290608Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 607 - 608 (2016)Oral presentationsContinuing professional developmentable treatment in cases of specific characteristics when au-thorized medicines cannot meet the patients\u2019 need; 2) suf-ficient scientific basis and/or clinical practice experience to justify their action. Distinguish the routine off-label use, which is the use of these medicines based on \u201chigh qual-ity\u201d evidence and the use in specific exceptional circum-stances; 3) information duty and a high degree of respect for patient rights, involving the patient/carer in decision-making process; 4) monitoring and reporting the outcomes, efficiency and adverse reactions; 5) considering self-mon-itoring of prescribing practices, liability and accountabili-ty. An additional special responsibility which among others falls on pharmacists should be to ensure that the prescrib-er is conscious for off-label prescribing and the reasons for that 6) production of compendia of certain medicines, en-listing those off-label uses judged to be legitimate.7) fi-nancial sustainability of an off-label use in medical prac-tice. Before deciding to compound a patient-specific prep-aration, a step by step evaluation of alternatives should be made. These alternatives include a therapeutic alternative, dose rounding or manipulation of licensed dosage forms (splitting tablets, crushing tablets/opening capsules, dis-persing their content in water or food, splitting supposito-ries, the use of a preparation designed for another route of administration). ConclusionPrescription, compounding, dispensing and adminis-tration of off label use of medicines should be regulated within the national profile of health care policy.The regulation regarding the practice of off-label med-icine use differs between countries. Some countries have this practice regulated by law, while in others it is cov-ered by good practice regulations or general profession-al recommendations and ethical standards. Assuming that there is no any general rule to regulate the \u201caccurate\u201d off-label use of medicines it is of paramount importance for the countries to find a national solution to fulfil the ethical and legal demand, especially in the areas of pharmaceuti-cal law and health insurance law. The common elements of these regulatory frameworks are the physicians\u2019 freedom to prescribe off-label medicines if the scientific evidence ex-ists and the need to inform patients when making this deci-sion. Making policy efforts, by adopting appropriate guide-lines for off-label medicines use, based on scientific evi-dence, with specifications of healthcare professionals\u2019 re-sponsibilities and a registry of off-label drug use in every day practice, would make possible a valuable approach to-wards ensuring a quality use of these medicines. Recom-mended solutions, as practiced in some countries, would support prescribes in more direct and  active approach to handle the ethical and legal phenomenon  associated with the off-label use of medicinesReferencesConroy, S., 2003.

In 2005 with the amendments of the Law on Healthcare (LH), the Primary Healthcare Re-form started to be intensively implemented, by primary health system transformation from Public to Private Sector. With this process which is almost entirely completed, all community pharmacies in RM have been privatized in the course of 2007, hence today, there are a total of 846 orga-nizational units out of which 714 have concluded contract with the Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia (HIFM). The Community Pharmacy is the basic unit in the phar-maceutical sector and it poses a primary level of pharma-ceutical care. The contemporary community pharmacy prac-tice in RM is clearly positioned in the Health Care System (LMMD, 2007) it acts in accordance with the principles of Good Pharmacy Practice (GPP), and it is organized in ac-cordance with the requirements of the International Quality Management Standards ISO 9001:2000, as well as the Envi-ronment protection standards ISO 14001:2004.  The activi-ties for implementation of GPP in Community Pharmacy are also based on the established standards by the World Health Organization (WHO), in regards to the definition of health, illness, as well as the role of the pharmacist in the Healthcare system (WHO, 2006). In line with all these improvements in 01.07.2013 the system of e-prescription has been introduced. Turnover of medicines in the Private Health Institution (PHI) community pharmacy The pharmaceutical sector in RM has been regulated, in accordance with the Laws on:  1) medicines and medi-cal devices; 2) Health care; 3) Health Insurance, further on, the Decree for Health Institutions Network, a series of  rule-books and other bylaws (LHP, 2004; LHI, 2010; LMMD, 2007). The work in the community pharmacies with the HIFM is regulated with a special Rulebook referring to the way of prescription and dispensing medicines and narcot-ic drugs (RB, 2010). In regards to the turnover of medi-cines, the medicines from \u201cthe list of medicines for prima-ry healthcare\u201d which are issued on prescription are provid-ed through the PHI Community Pharmacies which have con-cluded contracts with the HIFM. The rulebook for determin-ing the monthly funds that the PHI Community Pharmacies receive from the HIFM for the dispensed medicines on pre-scription from the abovementioned list funded by the HIFM, is in force. With the latest contracts and technical instruc-tions of HIFM from 2014, electronic communication has been established between HIFM and the pharmacies by in-troducing a system of electronic way of invoicing of the per-formed healthcare services. The pharmacies which have con-cluded contracts with the HIFM, submit monthly invoices for the dispensed medicines on prescription which are fund-ed by the HIFM in written and electronic form, together with the relevant supporting documentation. From the HIFM data on dispensed medicines on prescription, for the period 2013-2015 the trend of continuous growth in usage of medicines in the past years has been evident and this trend continues on in the first half of 2015 (HIFM, 2015a). Namely, most of the funds (27,5% from the total amount of HIFM) are foreseen for the ATC Group C \u2013 medicines for the cardiovascular sys-tem, while on the second place with about 15%, are the med-icines for the R group i.e., for treatment of illnesses of the re-spiratory system. The medicines that affect the CNS (ATC Group N) are on the third place with a share of 14, 5%. The most dispensed medicine according to the number of pre-scriptions in the first half of 2015 is the medicine enalapril with a total of 971.540 dispensed prescriptions.    S7 OP 291610Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 609 - 610 (2016)Oral presentationsContinuing professional developmentMedicines pricing policy  Another important aspect from the work of the Com-munity Pharmacy is the medicines pricing policy. Namely, there is a national medicines pricing policy in RM for the medicines from the essential medicines list and the medi-cines from the list of medicines funded by HIFM (positive list). In addition, a rulebook has been adopted which deter-mines the criteria and the procedure for determination of the reference prices of the medicines. In 2014, HIFM made the fifth in a row annual revision of all the reference prices from the positive list and determined new reference pric-es harmonized with the prices of medicines in the region and the new marketing approved process of the medicines from the National Agency of medicines and medical devic-es. The reference prices of medicines are guaranteed for all the insured persons.   As a result of the entire process, the latest data confirm that out of the total of 426 registered generic medicines from the Primary positive list, around 75% are without additional participation from the patients. The total num-ber of the medicines without participation per nonpropri-etary name of medicines is still the highest until now and in 2014 it was 42% of the total number of dispensed med-icines on prescription funded by the HIFM. Regarding the medicines per INN which are with participation, the larg-est part (82%) are with minimum participation or without participation. From the remaining medicines, 14% are with minimum participation and 4% are with maximum one. In the first half of 2015 the total increase of the number of dispensed prescriptions was around 10% compared to the same period of 2014 (HIFM, 2015b).  PHI community pharmacy inspection and most frequent irregularities detected in the workThe inspection of the PHI Community Pharmacy is performed on the bases of: 1) Law on Health Insurance, 2) bylaws, and 3) contracts concluded between HIFM and the PHI Pharmacies. The inspection is performed in the prem-ises of the PHI Pharmacies and with a person authorized for the finances. Defined representative control sample is at least 15 randomly selected medicines. The licensed inspec-tors from the HIFM and the inspectors from the Pharma-ceutical Sector have conducted a total number of 852 con-trols; 98% of the total number of pharmacies which have a contract with the HIFM have been controlled in 2014 (HIFM, 2015b). Regarding the noncompliance in the work of a certain PHI Pharmacy \u2013 working unit according to the Legal reg-ulations and the Contractual provisions, contractual penal-ties are foreseen from a measure reprimand to a measure one-sided termination of the contract. From the conduct-ed inspections of the PHI Pharmacies most frequent deter-mined irregularities in their work are the following: 1) the pharmacy does not have one or more medicines on pre-scription from the generic medicines for which it is obliged to have at all times; 2) irregularities for which a measure reprimand is issued (if these irregularities are not elimi-nated within 8 days the pharmacy is subject to contractu-al penalty); 3) problems with the documentation related to the pharmacy or the pharmaceutical staff; 4) irregularities in the way the medicines are dispensed; 5) the pharmacy does not have internet connection and 6) \u201cother\u201d. Upon the concluded noncompliance in the work of the pharmacies determined through the inspections, HIFM undertakes ad-equate measures.  Pharmaceutical care in community pharmacy  In order for the pharmacist to successfully perform all the duties in the pharmaceutical practice, he/she must possess specific knowledge, competencies and skills and to continually upgrade them. The findings confirm that the pharmacist in a community pharmacy about 80% of his/her time devotes only to the process of medicines dispensing, while the remaining of the time is focused on giving infor-mation about the medicines. This data impose the need for significant changes in the profile of community pharmacist work. In regards to the pharmaceutical services, offered by the PHI Pharmacies which have significant importance and direct influence on the health state of the patients, as one of the strategic goal,  is the continuous increase of the num-ber of services and their modernization through monitor-ing of the impressions of the users related to the provid-ed services. Namely, the community pharmacists active-ly participate in: promotion of the healthy lifestyle, pro-viding advice to the patients and consumers and stimulate them to look after their health, they organize presentations, run health campaigns, etc. From the services offered by the PHI community pharmacies one can emphasize: measure-ment of bodyweight, blood pressure, taking pregnancy test, further on, running programs for quitting of smoking, for reducing of bodyweight etc. ReferencesHIFM, 2015a: Annual report, http://www.fzo.org.mk/default.asp?ItemID=71140AA89564884A8568ECE6C89D90390 assessed, January, 2016.

It represents a motivator, in its own right, to-wards democratization and the development of human so-ciety. Its effects on economic growth are indisputable, also on workforce mobility, as well as on the ability of integrat-ing into international economic trends.Current perspective shows that EU countries, and the whole world as well, are faced with challenges brought on by globalization, issues in demographic trends, and the enormous changes in labor market, based on technological development. The last challenge underlines the need for a society firmly grounded on learning (knowledge-based-so-ciety), where training and education must come first. \u201cThe purpose of lifelong learning is to maintain and preserve a positive and active approach towards learning at all ages, in the course of a lifetime\u201d (MES, 2004).Education and learning has enabled mankind an \u2018easi-er and more successful placement, not only concerning labor market, but also in knowledge in general, in a world of con-stant engagements\u2019 thereby, irrefutably imposing the neces-sity of an \u2018intervention\u2019 for improving the educational sys-tem in each country. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes, ac-quired and developed in surroundings varying from family to academia, are not permanent. A firm integration and learning in the life of an adult is a very important aspect of lifelong learning. From the viewpoint of lifelong learning (LLL), learning is defined as an \u2018endless continuum\u2019 alongside the building of a positive attitude towards learning in general. From the standpoint of pharmacy, as a regulated pro-fession, LLL is of great importance. LLL in pharmacy is self-directed and practitioner centered, and it emphasizes the importance of practice-based learning. Pharmacists, as health professionals, in order to perform their healthcare activities with patients, need a license to work, thus they are obliged to continuous education. The purpose is to en-sure that pharmacists maintain and/or enhance their knowl-edge, skills, and competencies to practice throughout their careers in their specific area of practice.The Republic of Macedonia, as one of the countries that signed the Declaration of Bologna, an in the same time, a candidate for EU membership, tends to follow ev-ery European trend, including education. As in other Euro-pean countries \u2018the purpose of educational policy, of each one, is to provide the opportunity for a suitable education-al level for everyone and for all\u2019 (MES, 2004) age groups, ensuring that they are in possession of knowledge, skills and attitudes, in accordance with the demands of society and the labor market, which is at the same time integrated into the concept of lifelong learning. The pharmacist of the 21st century should be in possession of a large amount of knowledge, but also personal skills, such as communica-tion, critical thinking, problem-solving, the ability to work in teams and perceive lifelong learning. In the time period between 2007 until the end of 2013, the leading EU program in the domain of education and training is the program called \u201cLifelong learning|, imple-mented by the European commission. On national level, the national agencies, formed in participant countries, have been granted the implementation and running of the pro-gram. Provided the main goals of strategic documents for education and training in R. M. have been analyzed, it is noted that their definitions are to a great extent, compati-ble with the goals of European policies, but also with the \u201cLifelong learning\u201d program 2007 \u2013 2013. S7 OP 292612Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 611 - 612 (2016)Oral presentationsContinuing professional developmentThe Copenhagen protocol and the initiatives in the context of the Bologna protocol have been responsible for the beginning and significant progress in support of nation-al reforms of lifelong learning, higher education modern-ization, and the development of communal European in-struments, promoting quality, transparency and mobility (European Union, 2009).The new strategic framework of European collabo-ration in education and training |Education and training 2020\u201d has a particular focus on four strategic goals:1. Making lifelong learning and mobility a reality;2. Improvement of quality and efficiency of education and training;3. Promoting equality, social cohesion and active cit-izenship;4. Strengthening creativity and innovation, including entrepreneurship on all levels of education and training  Making lifelong learning and mobility a realityEven though in the domain of lifelong learning, there can be new initiatives that will develop, reflecting future challenges, there is still a need of further improvement, particularly in the implementation of ubiquitous lifelong learning strategies (European Union, 2009). The need of \u201caction\u201d s stressed, through which the development of na-tional frameworks for qualifications based on relevant edu-cational gateways will ensure their development, and their connection to the European qualification framework, the creation of more flexible learning pathways, including bet-ter passages between different sectors of education and training, a more open approach to non-formal and informal learning and improved transparency and acknowledgement of educational gateways. Further efforts are at the same time the need of promoting learning among adults, the improvement of quality of guiding systems and learning, to make it generally more attractive, and including new forms of learning and implementation of new technologies of teaching and learning. As an indispensable element of lifelong learning, and also an important means raising em-ployability and adaptability of people is the enlargement of mobility of all those learning, and the time periods spent in learning abroad, making them more of a rule than an ex-ception. While at the same time, already established prin-ciples in the European protocol for quality and mobility should be implemented.European programs for education and training have the tendency of promoting education that will strengthen the sustainability of economic growth. The ultimate gain is effectuating of the process of creating more and better po-sitions and a better social cohesion, thus leading to a soci-ety based on knowledge.At this very point we find the source of the claim that strengthening of educational capacities of the Republic of Macedonia, is largely conditioned by the use of Europe-an programs of education and training \u201cLifelong learning\u201d and consequently the new program for education and train-ing of youth and sports \u201cErasmus plus 2014 \u2013 2020\u201d.

There is not a con-sistent approach among countries in seeking compliance with pharmacist codes of ethics, and the level of pharma-cists\u2019 professional autonomy, which varies greatly around the world, is influenced by many factors, including a coun-try\u2019s history, social structures, social systems (e.g., eco-nomic, legal, political, and cultural systems), method of health care delivery and financing, and system of pharma-cy education (FIP, 2002).Issues of ethical behavior and autonomy are especially important to pharmacy practice because the profession is in transition, moving from largely a supply function to a pa-tient-care function. This transition will be impeded if prac-titioners do not have sufficient autonomy to act in support of patients\u2019 best interests. If pharmacy practice were to lim-it itself strictly to a supply function, various forces - eco-nomic, technologic, social, and political - would likely co-alesce over time to replace the pharmacist with other less expensive means of safely supplying medicines to patients. On the other hand, if pharmacists move toward assuming responsibility for helping patients and health profession-als make the best use of medicines, they will be providing a higher value service than a mere supply function - a vi-tal and complex service that is generally lacking in health care today. As pharmacist associations attempt to stimulate pharmacy\u2019s professional transition, they should help their members understand and address the ethical and moral di-mensions of this transition. In countries in which the ed-ucation of pharmacists has prepared them to enlarge their role in fostering responsible use of medicines, pharmacy practitioners have a moral obligation to put that education to its fullest use (FIP, 2002). In countries in which laws re-quire pharmacists to own community pharmacies, the case for preserving those laws will be stronger if pharmacists are engaged in professional activities beyond the supply func-tion and have demonstrated that they are a vital force in im-proving outcomes from the use of medicines.The FIP identified the following four categories (with specific examples) of ethical issues experienced by phar-macists in all areas of practice (IPF, 2013):1. Ethical challenges originating from individual and per-sonal considerations. - Lack of a sense of professional responsibility. - Lack of competence. - Personal values in conflict with professional val-ues, including conflicts \u2028that lead to refusal to provide service. - Stigma (e.g., denying service due to stigma [or in-convenience] towards illicit drug users or persons with disabilities). - Lack of awareness of principles of ethics in phar-macy. - Lack of care to apply ethical principles in prac-tice. - Cultural, religious, or national interests in conflict with professional ethics. - Personal characteristics and traits (e.g., lack of moral courage). 2. Ethical challenges originating from economic consider-ations, either by limiting costs or by increasing revenues. - Managing resources \u2013 allocating limited resources. - Profitability and viability of business (greed vs. reasonable profit). - Advertising to promote inappropriate consump-tion. S7 OP 293614Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 613 - 614 (2016)Oral presentationsContinuing professional development- Insurance company policies that conflict with pa-tients\u2019 best interests. - Financial incentives offered by industry to sell certain products. - Workload pressures. - Products selected for sale in the pharmacy (e.g., tobacco, complementary medicines of unproven efficacy or quality, slimming\u2028products that don\u2019t work). - Counterfeit drugs. - Conflict of interest in continuing education pre-sentations. - Conflict of interest in publishing research find-ings. 3. Ethical challenges originating from human interactions (employer-employee or between colleagues). - Inter professional conflict. - Policy of the owner/employer. - Conflicts between the employer and the practitio-ner\u2019s commitments to engagement with profes-sional organizations. - Reporting colleagues (\u201cwhistle-blowing\u201d). - Power imbalance and bullying/harassment (and subsequent job insecurity). - Lack of respect for colleagues. - Lack of good role modeling and initiative to teach younger practitioners. - Patient rights (e.g., privacy/confidentiality) (FIP, 2004). 4. Ethical challenges arising from the system or framework of practice.- Barriers imposed by institutional authorities. - Restrictions/challenges in adopting new technol-ogies. - Lack of revision (updating) of codes of ethics. - Varying interpretations of codes of ethics. - Perceptions that codes of ethics are nonbinding. - Legislative or regulatory constraints. - Paradigm shifts; new scientific knowledge (e.g., pharmacogenomics). Professional autonomy is the right and privilege grant-ed by a governmental authority to a class of professionals, and to each licensed individual within that profession, to exercise independent, expert judgment within a legally de-fined scope of practice, to provide services in the best in-terests of the client.Professional autonomy helps pharmacists fulfill their societal mission. That mission, as expressed in FIP\u2019s Cen-tennial Declaration, is to help patients make responsible use of medicines.Throughout its history, the profession of pharmacy has served humanity well around the globe. Although pharma-cy has great potential for extending its record of service, it faces many obstacles in attempting to do so, not the least of which are challenges related to professional ethics and autonomy. Pharmacy cannot achieve its full potential, and patients will not benefit from that potential, unless pharma-cists are committed to the highest standards of profession-al conduct and have sufficient autonomy to serve patients\u2019 best interests (The Tokyo Declaration, 1997).In every country, the appropriate association of phar-macists should produce a Code of Ethics for pharmacists setting out their professional obligations and take steps to ensure that pharmacists comply with the provisions of that Code. The obligations of pharmacists set out in these codes should include to act with fairness and equity in the alloca-tion of any health resources made available to them, to en-sure that their priorities are the safety, well being and best interests of those to whom they provide professional ser-vices and that they act at all times with integrity in their dealings with them, to collaborate with other health pro-fessionals to ensure that the best possible quality of health-care is provided both to individuals and the community at large (IPF, 2013).

Cyril & Methodius University, Goce Delcev 9A, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* etika1958@gmail.comIn the recent world all human activities are subjected to the ethical evaluation. The values of Good and Evil consist part of thinking as well as the behaviour of the people, af-firming and seeking the goodness, criticizing and escaping from bad purposes and actions. So is in all kinds of living, in the professions (which are almost 20.000) and in the scienc-es (more then 400), as everyday and special appearances of human acts. Professional and scientific ethics are very im-portant moral issues and visions of the modern civilisation.Pharmacy is one of the most important and the most interest contemporary activity and science. For this, its philosophy and ethics are instructive for understanding the world and the human orientations (on pharmacy and its ethics I wrote in 2008-th in text \u201cBioethics, the Good Phar-maceutical Practice, and Protection of Moral Principles\u201d, in my book Professional Ethics, 2011, pp. 68-83). Basic for the pharmacy is that it (although one of the oldest occu-pation and one of the very first science) is not one-dimen-sional, but one of the most complex new science with in-ter-disciplinary, even more correct with poly-disciplinary approach. It is part of medicine, as the most important and the most developed recent science and practice for saving and improving the human health, but part of biology too, as well as of the chemistry, of the economy and the others dif-ferent kinds of human thought and interests. The pharmacy is also defining by its relation to the bioethics, as modern and in the same time the most pompous orientation in the people\u2019s spiritual and social life, with whom moral aims and purposes are treating as model for almighty and par-ticular human practice in every region and act. So pharma-cy present oneself as exceptional instructive type of activi-ty to-day which can to show us on problems and necessery values in many districts of human services which reflect to the human condition. With that ethics of pharmacy is one of the most eminent and the most influential for the new (bio)ethical sights and axiological principles.For understanding the ethics of pharmacy is very con-siderable its complexity of activities-from definition the most difficult tasks before mind and the scientific inquir-ers, from numberless and capable laboratory examinations and improvings of medicines worldwide, from highqual-ified (offen industrial) performance of medicines, from its rigorous (the most frequently international) control for employment approval, from very advance organization of trade as well as the daily distribution for medical prac-tice and for individual necessary. Every of this steps of the large pharmaceutics activity are not only structure part of the medical practice as well as of the medical ethics also, they have special meaning and particular professional eth-ical norms, which compose general ethics of health. Phar-maceutics stores are indispensable portion for connection and realizing of medical treatment with personal aims of patients, but also centers for high higienical purposes, dis-tributors of healthy food, vitamins, and minerals, necessary services for small healthy aids etc. Every pharmaceutics levels have its very severe ethi-cal sense and values. Biotechnology and practical pharma-cy are expanded worldwide. But forfrom the pharmacy are not important only its simple and pointed norms. It helps to rethink the problems of human existence but also the ethics which concern us with the universal visions of human uni-ty with nature. In this case, in modern pharmacy we sense the tracks of classical alchemy, which is not lost for the humankind. As was said in Renaissance, we stand on the shoulders of countless people who worked of this fields\u2013and this can not be forget and wipe out. To the ethics of pharmacy that give new and very interesting dimensions.ReferencesTemkov, K., 2011. Professional Ethics. Dom na kulturata \u201cIvan Mazov - Klime\u201d, Kavadarci.

Free professions take up a special place and significance, all the way from Roman artes liberales to our times.Pharmaceutical profession, as one of the oldest, led by ethical principles, is regulated by postulates accepted by the profession members, and in modern times established through legislations. Typical determinants of the regulat-ed professions, which also refer to pharmacists, as cham-ber members, are as follows: following ethical principles, specific skills and knowledge, professional development, autonomy at work, continuing improvement, competen-cies development, professional associations, licensing. Up-dated legislations in Europe recognize chambers as most widespread professional organizations of pharmacists as healthcare professionals. Specificities of the field, as well as responsibilities in providing healthcare, ask of the phar-macists to possess optimum level of knowledge, skills, at-titude, and competency. The need for continuing profes-sional development is recognized by professional author-ity, employers, practices, as well as professional associa-tions, which, through their activities and projects, repre-sent support to pharmacists\u2019 professional development. Tools that allow development and competencies assess-ment of the pharmacists, are accepted by international as-sociations (WHO, FIP) and are applied in the South-East Europe (Stojkov et al., 2014). By analyzing legislations of the countries in the region \u2013 Serbia, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Mace-donia, a mutual platform can be noticed, which emphasiz-es pharmacists\u2019 professional identity, profession protection and care for patients\u2019 interests. It was confirmed through the Memorandum on cooperation, signed in Sarajevo in 2015.Goals of the paper are to perceive difficulties and pos-sible solutions when renewing the license for the first time and to collect data on pharmacists\u2019 continuing education and professional development, their attitudes and prefer-ences of the fields and types of education, form of organi-zation, limiting and facilitating factors.Materials and methodsData that were used are the ones on the number of pharmacists who need to renew their license with Pharma-ceutical Chamber of Serbia (FKS) in accordance with al-ready existing legislations, and the number of pharmacist who do not fulfill set conditions. The causes and possibility of overcoming this problem were also discussed.A research was conducted on pharmacists\u2019 continu-ing education and professional development, attitudes and preferences of the fields and types of education, form of organization, limiting and facilitating factors, structured in electronic questionnaire, put up on the FKS website during 2015. Electronic questionnaire was voluntarily filled in by 490 pharmacists.The results were presented in percentages, depend-ing on the total amount of participants, discussed and com-pared to relevant literature data on similar conducted re-search.S7 PP 295618Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 617 - 618 (2016)Poster presentationsContinuing professional developmentResults and discussionDuring 2015, FKS has initiated preparations for phar-macists\u2019 license renewal. According to the available data, from the total of 5500 Chamber members, 2500 pharma-cists needed to renew their license, after the expiration of the first seven-year period. The key condition for work per-mit -license renewal is the number of points gathered dur-ing licensed period, acquired through participation in ac-credited education. Preliminary analysis, which included data on pharmacists\u2019 education, pointed out that a signifi-cant number does not fulfill the required conditions (over 70%). In order to prevent the difficulties in the unobstruct-ed professional improvement and work permit renewal, the Chamber has launched a legislation modification.Pharmacists who participated in the poll, primarily employed in community pharmacies (93.9%), recognised professional competencies as the most needed profession-al improvement (55.7%), whereas expressed needs for per-sonal competencies and organization, as well as manage-ment competencies are significantly lower (26.4%; 17.4%). Pharmacists\u2019 familiarity with competencies and compe-tencies framework, is the result of a project, which last-ed for several years, on assessment and competencies de-velopment of pharmacists in Serbia (Stojkov et al., 2014), as well as the National document (www.farmkom.rs/index.php?) enacted by the FKS Assembly. The Chamber, as a professional organization, provides continuing education of pharmacists, and their areas of interest, so the poll in-cluded a question on the fields that are of interest to phar-macists, and the preference was given to safety and effi-ciency of nutrients in polytherapy (28.7%), as well as spe-cial populations (children and elderly) and medicine safety (27.2%). The participants in the poll have shown high pref-erence towards the following forms of learning: showcase and workshops; and when it comes to study models, the internet and interactive workshops were the first choice. Day of the week that suits most participants was Saturday (49.5%), and the limiting factors were expenses and time (34.9%; 51%). The research conducted in Australia (Mari-ot et al., 2007), stated availability and relevance of the con-tent as the limiting factors, next to time. Also, more flex-ible education programmes of education were suggested, and they are becoming more significant in Serbia as well \u2013 digital formats available on the internet are dominant as first choice of learning (48.6%). Access to the internet and foreign language knowledge were not recognized as rele-vant limiting factors among the participating pharmacists: 48.6% and 32.6% of participants respectfully marked these factors as least relevant in the sense of limitation. From the answers to the question: \u201dHow many continuing ed-ucations did you participate in last year\u201d, it can be deter-mined that pharmacists took an active part in their profes-sional improvement: over 40% took part in 2-5, and 45.3% in more than 5 continuing educations. Only 5.1% stated that they did not participate.ConclusionThe road that leads professions of the modern times to-wards modern formatting is drafted through several stages of professionalism: modification of legislation and protec-tion of professions by means of law, improvement in prac-tice through professional development, establishing spe-cial trust relationship between free professions representa-tives and beneficiaries, providing professional associations with wider authorization, and finally cooperation on a re-gional level. The chambers, as most widespread pharma-ceutical organizations should provide support to continu-ing professional development, protection of profession\u2019s interests, as well as be important factors in improvement of pharmaceutical healthcare.ReferencesMarriott, J.L., Duncan, G.J., McNamara, K., 2007.

In gener-al, for the purpose of compounding, many unit operations and decision making processes are required that, on the one hand, more fully define this activity in several ways;  one of the simpler definitions is as follows:\u201cThe act of prepa-ration, mixing, assembling, altering, packaging, and label-ing of a drug, drug-delivery device or device in accordance with a licensed practitioner\u2019s prescription, medication or-der, or initiative based on the practitioner\u2013patient\u2013phar-macist\u2013compounder relationship in the course of profes-sional practice (GSP, 2016). As acknowledged, compound-ed medicines, medicinal products and devices in HP are not approved by competent regulatory body thus, the reg-ulatory approval process for medicines do not verify their quality, safety or effectiveness. All these underlining rea-sons can serve as further evidence of the paramount impor-tance for establishing contemporary compounding practice in HPto comprise not only the art, current scientific princi-ples, good pharmacy practice, facility, equipment, person-nel and etc., but also provisions for pharmacists to comply with policy, regulations and guidelines in this filed. Addi-tionally, it is required to put the focus on issues and chal-lenges related to the implementation of the official stan-dards for Good Compounding Practice (GCP), if they ex-ist. In continuum, with the development of the sciences re-lated to the dosage form formulation and advanced thera-pies, the position and responsibilities of hospital pharma-cists (HPs) requires enhancing their knowledge and skills in the field of patient centered pharmaceutical care.Recommendations for implementation of standardsIt is known that compounding of medicines in HP is followed by clinical and technical risks. Therefore, for the purpose of risk reduction, guideline or algorithm adopt-ed on national level to facilitate decision making process within this function is strongly recommended.  For exam-ple, in many cases the HPs should have to verify wheth-er an equivalent medicine is available on the national mar-ket or not, and consequently, to consider certain alternative therapies including risk evaluation concept. In line with this, the HPt, for instance, can suggest usage of a less po-tent steroid molecule or dosage form instead of dilution of certain formulation or in other case, to advice differ-ent route of drug administration for patient (GMC, 2013). When all solutions are exhausted, HPs have to compound a dosage form compliant with the best health care needs of patient. Additionally, the basic principles of good prac-tices in compounding demand HPs to comply with nation-al regulations and with all relevant international standards were developed by the World Health Organization (Good Manufacturing Practices-GMP Guide), EudraLex and the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention and Pharmaceuti-cal Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S-Good Prepa-ration Practices-GPP Guide) including requirements in rel-evant Pharmacopeias. To start with, an appropriate quali-S7 PP 296620Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 619 - 620 (2016)Continuing professional developmentPoster presentationsty assurance system has to be established with the aim to reduce the risks linked with compounding medicinal prod-ucts- whether it is sterile or non-sterile. Therefore, a risk assessment for compounded medical products should al-ways be carried out in order to define their quality assur-ance level. According to the references presented in the Resolution CM/Res (2011)1 on quality and safety assur-ance requirements for medicinal products compounded in pharmacies for the special needs of patients (Council of Europe, 2011), there is a need of establishing a \u201crisk evalu-ation system\u201d for the  assessment of  \u201chigh- risk\u201d and \u201clow- risk\u201d  compounded  medicinal products. In this context, it is recommended that the GMP guideline has to be used as a reference for an appropriate quality assurance for \u201chigh risk preparations\u201d, while the PIC/S GPP Guide can be used for so called, \u201clow-risk preparations\u201d. However, the appli-cation of other guidelines with an equivalent quality level is possible, depending on the national legislation or guid-ance. According to GMP and GPP guides, there are integral elements needed for reducing risk linked with compound-ing, including: standard operation procedures affirmed by quality assurance unit, calibrated equipment, quality con-trol of starting materials, evaluation of starting materials and compounding  process by means of health hazards, documented independent check of pharmaceutical calcu-lations, trained personnel involved etc. To underline as an example, the organization of services for total parenteral nutrition in many cases is a real challenge for HPs due to the unavailability of commercially prepared products. As it is known, this service of HP may be followed by risk in calculation errors, stability and incompatibility connected with product compounding. However, since the aforemen-tioned GCP guidelines are more general they cannot cover in detail all aspects thus, some countries developed addi-tional national guidelines on compounding adopted by cer-tain professional bodies (PB, 2015).These guidelines in-clude both, steps in compounding process and competenc-es required. Another important compounding aspects relat-ed to algorithm for decision making process when there is a need to choose suitable dosage form for the patient need. For example, firstly, it is looking for standardized, validat-ed dosage form; secondly, if it is not available, then com-pounding according to scientific principles and practice is recommended and thirdly, whenever suitable and possi-ble, to consider compounding of the simplest pharmaceu-tical formula (Glass and Haywood, 2006). The next step is the process of dosage form evaluation which includes several GCP related aspects that must be considered such as: ingredients quality, palatability, irritability, toxicity and stability; possibility of extensive API metabolism by first pass, therapeutic index data and bioavailability; packaging, storage, and labeling, assessment for possible interactions development between API-excipients-containers, quality control, stability, expiration, and beyond-use dating stabil-ity testing date etc. Additional important steps tailored to compounding process in HP environment include: evalua-tion of toxicity and safety of compounded dosage form and monitoring of the clinical effect ad and adverse drug re-actions etc. When medicines with marketing authorization have to be modified to facilitate administration there is a benefit for compounding pharmacists to acquire informa-tion from the manufacturer about: physical and chemical data about API, excipients,  critical functional character-istics of dosage form, possibility for manipulation in order to change the dosage form, possibility to obtain API from manufacture to compound quality dosage form, relevant information about testing and analyzing API on request by pharmacist (EMA/CHMP/PEG/194810/2005). ConclusionHPs should maintain at least four sets of records for compounding. An existing development requires reference library and other sources of information relevant to com-pounding to be included in the guidelines for GCP. As a provider of pharmaceutical care, the HPs have to be well educated and trained in the field of art and science of pharmacy compounding for creating personalized medi-cines solutions. In addition to the policy and good practic-es, further guidelines supporting the creation of safe and effective medicines have to be put in place.ReferencesEMA/CHMP/PEG/194810/2005, 2005.

They become dominant health burden, with 70-80% of health-care costs spent on their management. Chronic diseases are interrelat-ed, have common risk factors and are largely preventable. However, in their prevention, only 3% of health expenses are presently invested (Commission of the European Com-munities, 2007; The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2012). Management of chronic diseases has been also pointed as a serious concern, with WHO\u2019s statement that approximate-ly 50% of chronic patients do not adhere to therapy and re-ports on the economic magnitude of this problem (WHO, 2003), 194,500 deaths and estimated costs of \u20ac125bn annu-ally in the EU due to miss-dose and non-adherence to pre-scribed medication (PGEU, 2008). Therefore, a successful and sustainable chronic disease management program re-quires a collaborative approach at the system level, both professional-directed and patient-oriented (NEHI, 2009).The current primary care models implicate that the strong physician-patient-pharmacist relationships are not promoted; training for chronic disease management is rare-ly sufficient and there is insufficient continuity and coordi-nation among health-care providers. Among the healthcare professionals, community pharmacists are the most acces-sible and are in an ideal position to assist the management of patients with chronic diseases. However, despite the re-cent developments in pharmacy practice there still appears to be an overall unawareness of their potential within this area of health-care system, with \u201cthe potential for pharma-cy being untapped\u201d (Petrushevska-Tozi and Mladenovska, 2012; WHO, 2011). Therefore, WHO has been called phar-macies upon to engage further in health promotion, chron-ic disease prevention and rational use of medicines, specif-ically by supporting people with chronic conditions, im-proving their quality of life and self-management, support-ing better knowledge about pharmacotherapy, etc (WHO, 2011). However, in order to take up the challenge, it would be necessary to examine what have already been done in chronic disease management by community pharmacists in the Republic of Macedonia, from both patients and health-care providers perspectives, which was the aim of this study. Materials and methodsFor the patients and health-care providers, two sepa-rate cross-sectional descriptive questionnaires were de-signed, where combined pre-coded open ended and mul-tiple choice closed questions were used with type of re-sponse format A-agree, B-partly agree, C- disagree, cov-ering two essential components: need of providing patient education by a pharmacist to prevent chronic diseases and disability by promoting healthy life-style and need of ex-panding pharmacy services and interventions in chronic disease management. The questionnaires were pre-tested by involving the target groups in the design (10 commu-nity pharmacists (PHs) from different pharmacies, 10 gen-eral practitioners (GPs), 10 specialists in internal medicine (SPs) and 10 patients (PTs), to evaluate the apparent (log-ical) validity of the questionnaires (instructions, coverage of the issue of research, format and questions sequences, legibility and readability, too much/little offered answers, measurability of the questions, time for completing, etc.). The average age (\u00b1SD) of the health-care professionals S7 PP 297622Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 621 - 622 (2016)Continuing professional developmentPoster presentationswas 47.3 \u00b110.5 yrs, of which 76.7% were females. Related to the profile of patient group, the average age (\u00b1SD) was 67\u00b19 yrs, with most of them females (80%) and 60% hav-ing university degree diploma. The responses were collected face-to-face in the GPs\u2019 and SPs\u2019offices and community pharmacies, from Janu-ary 3rd to February 28th, 2016, with the surveyors being pharmacists. Only 10% of the respondents stated that some of the questions were unclear and these items will be fur-ther reconsidered when generating direct anonymous final questionnaire. Obtained data were tabulated using Microsoft Excel\u00ae (Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA, USA), computed and consequently evaluated using statistical software STAT-GRAPHICS Centurion XVI evaluation (Stat Point tech-nologies Inc., USA). Results and discussionUnlike GPs, who think that patients are either well- or partly educated about the chronic diseases, their preven-tion and management (30% and 70%, respectively), 20% and 40% of the PTs, 20% and 70% of the SPs, and 50% and 50% of the PHs believe that patients are not properly or partly educated, respectively, pointing to the necessity of pharmacists to use their competences and skills in educat-ing patients about prevention and management of chronic disease. This necessity was approved by 60% of the PHs and SPs, while 40% of them it partly approved. Interest-ingly, 30% of GPs were not agreed with this statement, un-like 100% of PTs, who expect best pharmacy practice and care in this area. In this respect, 100% of PHs and 90% of PTs are agreed that engagement of pharmacists in chronic disease management would improve patients\u2019 use of med-icines and adherence and their understanding about the chronic diseases they have. However, only 20% of the GPs and 40% of the SPs think that CPs can improve patients\u2019 use of medicines, pointing that the pharmacists cannot im-prove patients\u2019 understanding about their chronic disease. Within the chronic diseases management, engage-ment of pharmacists in education of chronic patients for using medical devices for drug administration or therapeu-tic monitoring was also evaluated. The most of responders were agreed that this activity contributes to efficacious dis-eases management by a patient itself and improve outcome of the treatment. Only 20% of the PHs and 30% of the GPs were not agreed with one or both of these statements, un-like PTs, who were all agreed. Considering engagement of the community pharmacists in disease/therapeutic moni-toring, 70% of PHs, 60% of GPs, 50% of SPs and 100% of PTs acknowledge the need of these additional services. In-terestingly, 20% of PHs are not interested and 10% of GPs and SPs think the same. Interest and willingness of pharmacists to be engaged in education, care and control of patients with chronic dis-eases were also a matter of interest. For 90% of PHs, 60% of GPs and 100% of SPs, pharmacy structure was identi-fied as a key factor/barrier. All health care responders were consent that it is necessary to determine the resources and content for education and training of pharmacists in man-aging chronic diseases and to implement and develop mu-tual cooperation between pharmacists and physicians for a better control of chronic diseases. ConclusionFrom the processed answers one can conclude that the role of community pharmacists in chronic disease manage-ment is indisputable. Further thorough research is needed to identify the key areas for intervention for medication adherence to be improved, pharmacy services to be intro-duced or their scope expanded, interprofessional collabora-tion to be strengthened, and education and training of phar-macists in managing chronic diseases to be implemented. In addition, a strategy for all stakeholders should be de-veloped, in order awareness and understanding of the role of pharmacists in providing pharmaceutical care and addi-tional services in patients with chronic diseases to be in-creased.ReferencesCommission of the European Communities, 2007.

Macedonia3Alkaloid AD Skopje, PC Pharmaceuticals, Blvd. Aleksandar Makedonski 12,  1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* magl@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionResponsible self-medication with over-the counter (OTC) drugs assumes that individuals treat minor ailments and conditions with medicines approved by national regu-latory agencies and are available without prescription, safe and effective when used as directed (Bakic-Miric, 2009; Cavaco and Pereira, 2012). Literature data indicate that self medication is prevalent form of medical care in the world, with estimation that 80% of all medical symptoms are self-recognized and self-treated without professional care where more than 92% of all consumers used at least one OTC drug in the past year, and 55% of which have used more than one (Wertheimer and Serradell, 2008). Community pharmacists working on the frontline of health-care system are primary and easiest accessible source of professional information for OTC drugs as most commonly they are supplied in community pharmacies, al-though in some countries there are OTC drugs that can be sold elsewhere. Community pharmacists - OTC consum-ers interface is of substantial importance for ensuring prop-er and safe OTC drug use as community pharmacists have more experience with self-care products than any other health care professional (Gazibara et al., 2013).The aim of the present study was to investigate com-munity pharmacists\u2019 attitudes, perceptions, practice and perceived barriers/obstacles in ensuring the proper phar-maceutical care with OTC medicines in the community pharmacies in Republic of Macedonia (RM).Materials and methodsEducational course entitled \u201cThe role of pharmacist in self-care and self medication\u201d was conducted by pharma-ceutical company Alkaloid AD, Skopje in a two months period, February to March, 2014. Participant of this course were mainly community pharmacists and minority of phar-macy technicians, from different regions in RM. Survey was completed by 465 participants of the course.For the purpose of this survey, a structured anonymous questionary was used. The questionnaire included 26 items related to the community pharmacists` attitudes and per-ceptions in everyday practice with OTC drugs as well as obstacles in ensuring the proper pharmaceutical care. The anonymous questionnaire covers data related to: i) socio-demographic factors (city, age, gender, work ex-perience in the pharmacy), location and workforce in the community pharmacy and average number of patients and prescriptions per week; ii) attitudes (job satisfaction, im-portance of OTC counseling in everyday practice, willing-ness to provide OTC recommendations) and iii) probable barriers (lack of time, lack of trainings, continuing educa-tion courses, etc.) Obtained data were tabulated using Microsoft Excel\u00ae (Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA, USA) and were comput-ed and consequently evaluated using statistical software STATGRAPHICS Centurion XVI evaluation (StatPoint technologies Inc., USA).S7 PP 298624Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 623 - 624 (2016)Continuing professional developmentPoster presentationsResults and discussionA vast majority of the surveyed participants were grad-uated pharmacists (89.2%) while pharmacy technicians with 5.4% were significant minority. The rest 5.4% did not pro-vide information about educational attainment. All regions in RM were represented, with prevalence of the capital, Skopje, with 28.9% followed by Pelagonija Region (Bitola, Prilep, Resen) with 16.1%, South-Eastern Region (Gevgeli-ja, Bodanci, Dojran, Radovis, Strumica, Valdandovo) with 12.3%, South-Western Region (Debar, Kicevo, Ohrid, Stru-ga, Vevcani) with 10.6%, Polog Region (Gostivar, Tetovo) with 9.7%, Eastern Region (Stip, Kocani, Berovo, Delce-vo, M.Kamenica, Vinica) with 9%, Vardar Region (Veles, Kavadarci, Sv. Nikole, Negotino) with 7.3% and North-Eastern Region (Kratovo, Kumanovo) with 5.9%. Female gender was represented with 90.5%. The dominant cohort (52.3%) was in age group of 23 \u2013 35 years. The average community pharmacy experience was 11.88\u00b19.28 years. Nearly 42% were community pharmacy owners. Most of the surveyed pharmacists (53.12%) reported that communi-ty pharmacy they work in, has more than 2000 prescriptions and 29.03% reported 1000-2000 prescriptions dispensed per month. Overall job satisfaction was rated on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 refers to highest and 5 to lowest satisfaction. The determined average satisfaction was 2.24\u00b11.2 with mode of 1 in 30.32% and only 4.1% were not satisfied by their job as community pharmacists. The highest percentage of respon-dents (28.8%) reported counseling patients on OTC medi-cations 16-20% of their working time, which equates to the approximately 75 to 90 minutes during an eight hour shift. Slightly over 50% of the respondents reported that they were educated for OTC drugs during their undergraduated studies, however still high percentage - 46.67% were not. Approximately one third of the surveyed community phar-macists always advice patients for OTC drugs use while the majority (60.43%) frequently does that.Solely, continuing education courses were source of OTC drugs knowledge for 29.89% of surveyed partici-pants, working experience (practice) for 26.67%, under-graduated studies for 5.81% and pharmaceutical compa-nies for 4.73%. Combined, continuing education cours-es/practice was reported by 17.85% and undergraduated studies/practice by 7.96% of the respondents as OTC drug knowledge source. More than a half (57.2%) of the sur-veyed pharmacist agreed that OTC drug counseling is im-portant component of community pharmacy practice, while 42.6% strongly agreed with this statement. Nearly equal percent responded that they have enough time for OTC drugs counseling (41.94%) and opposite (not enough time - 42.79%). A majority (80%) agreed that patients accept their advices in respect to OTC drugs selection. Almost equally either agree or strongly agree (app. 50% each) that they are willing to provide OTC recommendations when given the opportunity. Confidence in own competentiali-ty (knowledge) related to adequate OTC drugs selection was expressed by 65.6% of the respondents. Participants were asked to rank their knowledge about certain OTC drugs classes, where 1 referred to highest and 7 to low-est rank. The highest scores were determined for cough/cold OTC drugs 1.89\u00b11.31 and pain/analgesics OTC drugs 1.96\u00b11.34, while the lowest scores were related to eye/ear and first aid OTC drugs, 5.16\u00b12 and 4.82\u00b12.24 according-ly. The results were comparable with the ranking related to the patients\u2019 demands for classes of OTC drugs coun-seling (rank of 1 indicated most frequently and 7 - least frequently). Advices for cough/cold OTC drugs were re-quested in average of 1.71\u00b11.12 and pain/analgesics OTC drugs, in average of 1.95\u00b11.35 with a mode of 1, 52.9% and 39.35% respectively. Patients` demands for first aid and eye/ear OTC drugs counseling were lowest with aver-age of 5.45\u00b11.96 and 5.35\u00b11.8 consequently.Respondents agreed (52.7%) and strongly agreed (44.52%) that patient counseling positively influence com-munity pharmacy practice. Most frequently (63.87%) ques-tions and advices for OTC drugs are initiated by the commu-nity pharmacists, while 27.3% are instigated by the patients. Majority of the surveyed participants, 61.94%, were interested for input into OTC drug counseling while 33.98% articulated high interest.Participants were asked to rank six quoted barriers/obstacles that might influence proper pharmaceutical care with OTC medicines in the community pharmacies. Rank of 1 referred to the most significant and 6 to least signif-icant barrier/obstacle.  Lack of time and personal scarci-ty with average of 1.55\u00b11.22 and 2.78\u00b11.57 respectively, were identified as the most significant barriers/obstacles. ConclusionOutcomes from the conducted survey provided an in-sight to the main attitudes, willingness, barriers/obstacles and educational requirements of pharmacists in Republic of Macedonia related to self-medication with OTC drugs. The results obtained are valuable for the pharmaceutical community and can be used in order to improve and ad-vance community pharmacy practice by further promoting the pharmacist\u2019s role in self-care.ReferencesBakic-Miric, N., 2009.

Therefore, any low esteem or dissatisfaction conceived by any of the key components of the service chain may relatively threaten the comprehen-sive health care. Pharmacists as the key players in this mul-tidisciplinary sector are no exception to this rule. In Ban-gladesh a study was conducted to identify the factors af-fecting employee job satisfaction of pharmaceutical sec-tor (Parvin and Kabir, 2011). Given the noticeable lack of studies involving management styles with the job satisfac-tion of pharmacists this study attempts to address the gap in the literature. In 2007 Jovic-Vranes A. et al. found that job satisfaction was associated with good interpersonal re-lationships, working environments and a feeling of being able to provide good quality care. Other studies opine that there is a strong association between low levels of job sat-isfaction and organizational factors (Piko et al., 2006). A study by Krogstad U. et al. 2006, reflected that support and feedback from one\u2019s immediate supervisor was the main explanatory variable for job satisfaction among nurses. Bu-ciuniene et al. 2003, concluded that low salaries result in low job satisfaction among Lithuanian primary health care doctors. Rad, Yarmohammadian, 2006 and De Stefano et al. 2005, exerted that the greater the chances for develop-ment within the organization, the greater the likelihood of a higher level of job satisfaction. The results of Bodur, 2001, study showed low levels of job satisfaction mainly due to working conditions and salary. A significant relationship between job satisfaction and management style was exhib-ited in a master\u2019s\u2019 thesis by Nakata, 1992. The research questions of the present study are: 1. What are the management styles (MS) of first-line managers as perceived by staff pharma-cists (SP) in the marketing strategy depart-ments in selected pharmaceutical companies? 2. What are the management styles (MS) of first-line managers desired by staff pharmacists (SP) in the marketing strategy departments in select-ed pharmaceutical companies? 3. Is there a relationship between the perceived management style (MS) of first-line managers and the job satisfaction (JS) of staff pharma-cists (SP)?  The purpose of this study is to determine the SP\u2019s per-ception on MS and its relationship to their JS working in MSDs in reputed pharmaceutical companies of Bangla-desh. This study also investigates the MS that SPs desire in their organizations. The broader purpose of the study is to provide information that might assist pharmaceutical com-panies in providing the best working environment for phar-macists\u2019 job satisfaction, efficiency and retention.Materials and methodsThe conceptual framework for this cross-sectional study design is based on Likert management theory which describes a continuum of four types of management styles and the adaptations of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. Per-S7 PP 299626Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 625 - 626 (2016)Continuing professional developmentPoster presentationsceived and desired management styles (independent vari-ables) were measured by the Profile of Organizational Characteristics, Form SLM-1978 by Rensis Likert Asso-ciates, Inc. with response choices from l to 4. Each ques-tion requires two responses, one that describes the manage-ment style on the participant\u2019s working unit at the present time and one that describes how the subject would like the management style on the working unit to operate. Job sat-isfaction (dependent variable) was measured by a job sat-isfaction tool based on a tool developed by Munson and Heda (1974) which is based on the conceptualization of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. The subscales measure: au-thoritative satisfaction, interpersonal satisfaction (belong-ing), involvement needs (ego needs), training/other facili-ties satisfaction, workload satisfaction and satisfaction re-garding payment/promotion. Additionally, demographic data, such as educational level, age range were collected. So, there were three types of interview questionnaires used for this study: Questionnaire A- written in English, con-sisting of 19 questions regarding job satisfaction among the pharmacists, Questionnaire B- written in English, con-sisting of 10 questions, each of them having 2 parts, one was for the perceived management style and the other for desired management style, Questionnaire C-7 items elicit-ed socio-demographic data including the respondents\u2019 age, gender, level of education.  A sample of 384 individuals was randomly selected from 10 pre-selected pharmaceu-tical companies which belong to top 20 companies of the country. Data was gathered through face-to face interviews with individual respondents between July and October, 2015 and it was analyzed with the program SPSS v22.0.Results and discussionAmong the respondents 63.6% were male and 36.4% female. The data indicated that the SP currently perceive an overall benevolent-authoritative style of management on their units represented by an overall mean score of 4.66 which reflects less fear and punishment than in the exploit-ative-authoritative style but does not use staff involvement. The SP desired an MS approaching the participative group style with an overall mean score of 7.2 which expresses the necessity of a style that uses ideas solicited from the staff and asks for the staff\u2019s opinions on matters that af-fect their work.The JS subscale with the highest mean score was in-terpersonal satisfaction (4.27) which is associated with the concept of belonging and warmth in relationships at their workplace. The JS subscale score having the lowest mean was payment (3.42, where 3=Disagree slightly) which con-veys that SP were in general less satisfied with the income and opportunities and scope for promotion in their jobs.Null hypothesis H0: There is no relationship between perceived management style and job satisfaction. Alter-nate hypothesis Ha: There is significant relationship be-tween perceived management style and job satisfaction. The Pearson Product-Moment Correlation score for these two variables was r=0.436 (p=0.00000000000876) which convincingly rejects the null hypothesis and is further in-tensified by Spearman rank correlation and Kendall rank correlation coefficient \u03c1 = 0.317 (P = 0.0000000156) and \u03c4 = 0.239 (P = 0.0000000159) respectively.ConclusionThe strong correlation between management style and job satisfaction emphasizes the need to intervene with an appropriate organization-specific MS (i.e. participative group style) to promote JS among pharmacists.ReferencesBodur, S., 2002.

Macedonia* lea.taneska@gmail.com, risteska_eka@live.comIntroductionAcne vulgaris is a common chronic skin disease affect-ing \u223c85% of adolescents and young adults, although all age groups could be affected. Active pharmaceutical ingredi-ents (API) and commercial dosage forms that are common-ly used for acne treatment are characterized by lack of effi-cacy and number of side and adverse effects mainly relat-ed to the inability for targeted and controlled drug delivery. Currently, there is extensive ongoing research for finding alternative approaches for acne treatment.  Topical appli-cation of propolis (natural bioactive compound) has shown notable efficacy against microorganisms etiologically con-nected with acne. However, often propolis extracts due to distinctive color, strong and aromatic odor and stickiness fail to ensure patient compliance. One approach that might be used for improvement of acne treatment efficacy and patient compliance is to incorporate API into drug delivery carriers (micro/nanoparticulated) thus enabling controlled drug release at the site of action. Having in mind previ-ous, our group is working on development of porous mic-roparticulated systems (microsponges) for topical delivery of propolis with certain physico-chemical and biopharma-ceutical properties favoring prolonged release, enhanced efficacy and patient compliance in acne treatment. In the previous work of Dodov et al. (2016) microsponges load-ed with 20% propolis ethanolic propylene glycolic extract were formulated. The current work is addressed to formu-lation and characterization of microsponges prepared with 25% propolis ethanolic extract using two different hydro-philic surfactants.  Materials and methodsMaterialsEthylcellulose (EC) and Chitosan (CTS) (high vis-cous) were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich, USA. Tween 80 (T80), Tween 20 (T20), Span 80 (S80), Aceton (ACT), and Dichlormethane (DM) were obtained from Merck, Germany. Propolis ethanolic extract (PE) (25%) was sup-plied from Apimel, Macedonia. All other chemicals and re-agents were of analytical grade and used without any mod-ifications.Preparation of microsponges loaded with propolis extract The PE loaded microsponges (MPL) were prepared using previously optimized double emulsion solvent dif-fusion technique (Crcarevska et al., 2015; Dodov et al., 2016). This method involves preparation of a primary W/O emulsion, and a subsequent second emulsification result-ing in a W/O/W multiple emulsion. The primary W/O sys-tem was prepared by continuous dropwise addition of in-ternal water phase (CTS (0.8% (m/v) in 3% acetic acid (v/v)), water (W1) and ACT) to oil phase (EC, S80, DHM and PE) during a period of 4 min under continuous ro-tor\u2013stator homogenization (Ultra-Turrax1 T-25, Dispers-ing element S25N-10G, IKA, Germany, 24000 rpm, ambi-ent conditions). After the addition of internal water phase was completed, mixing was continued for additional 1 min. Multiple W/O/W emulsion was prepared by dropwise ad-dition of primary W/O emulsion to outer water phase (wa-ter (W2) and T80 or T20 as surfactant), for time period of 10 minutes at the same conditions as for W/O prima-ry emulsion.The removal of ACT, DHM, ethanol and the solidifica-S8 OP 300630Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 629 - 630 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessiontion of MPLs was finalized under continuous mixing (24000 rpm, 40 \u00b0C, 30 min). The resulting MPL dispersion was cooled down to room temperature under magnetic stirring (200 rpm, 20 min, Variomag, Multipoint HP 15, Germany). Composition of the prepared formulations was as fol-lows: CTS (0.8%):W1:ACT (ml) = 1:0.67:5, S80/EC=0.33, T20/W2 or T80/W2 = 0.015. S80/DHM:PE/EC was 0.0039:0.5 (MPL1), 0.004:1 (MPL2), 0.0043:2 (MPL3) and 0.005:4 (MPL4). A total of 8 formulations were pre-pared. 4 formulations were prepared with T20 (MPL-T20) and 4 with T80 (MPL-T80) as hydrophilic surfactant.Nonencapsulated PE was separated and prepared MPLs were freeze dried (Freeze-dryer, Labconco, USA, 0,05 mBar, - 49 \u00b0C, 24h) in presence of  cryoprotecting agent (20% trehalose/g EC)MPLs characterizationCharacterisation of particle size and particle size distribution of MPLs was done by laser diffractometry (Crcarevska et al., 2015). Particle size was expressed in micrometers (\u00b5m) by volume diameter Dv50\u00b1SD, while particle size distribution was expressed in term of SPAN factor\u00b1SD.The non-encapsulated fraction of PE was separated from the MPLs, and the propolis content (PC) was deter-mined according to procedure described by Dodov et al. (2016). PC was expressed as dry PE (g)/EC (g)\u00b1SD.MPL`s in vitro release studies were performed by non-membranic dissolution model (Dodov et al., 2016). In brief, accurately weighted amounts of freeze-dried MPLs with known and equal content of PE (0.002 g dry PE/ ml) were placed in closed glass tubes on thermostat water-bath hor-izontal shaker (4h, 32 \u00b0C, 40 rpm, (Unitronic OR, Selecta, Barcelona, Spain)). In appropriate time intervals the sam-ples were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 5 min) (Tehtnika Centric 322B, Slovenia) and 8 ml of the total volume of superna-tants were collected. This volume was replaced with 8 ml of distilled water (32 \u00b0C) and dissolution studies continued.Drug release data were fitted into zero order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas and Peppas and Sahlin model (DD-Solver 1.0 - Microsoft Excel menu-driven add-in program).Results and discussionDv50 for formulations prepared with T20 as hy-drophilic surfactant was 26.67\u00b12.15 \u00b5m (MPL1-T20), 34.79\u00b16.46 \u00b5m (MPL2-T20), 89.72\u00b15.64 \u00b5m (MPL3-T20) and 157.05\u00b131.86 \u00b5m (MPL4-T20), while for those pre-pared with T80, Dv50 was 31.56\u00b11.19 \u00b5m (MPL1-T80), 75.56\u00b11.02 \u00b5m (MPL2-T80), 96.15\u00b14.01 \u00b5m (MPL3-T80) and 475.47\u00b117.24 \u00b5m (MPL4-T80). Particle size for freeze dried MPLs was 9.14\u00b10.27 \u00b5m (MPL1-T20), 20.41\u00b10.87 \u00b5m (MPL2-T20), 36.25\u00b11.89 \u00b5m (MPL3-T20), 117.68\u00b14.19 \u00b5m (MPL4-T20), 25.26\u00b10.0.66 \u00b5m (MPL1-T80), 22.87\u00b11.35 \u00b5m (MPL2-T80), 33.50\u00b13.32 \u00b5m (MPL3-T80) and 117.09\u00b111.51 \u00b5m (MPL4-T80). Obtained results pointed that particle size increased with increment of PE/EC. When particle size of freeze dried MPLs was compared significant difference was determined in MPL1-T20/MPL1-T80 (one way ANOVA, Fischer LSD, p<0.05).PC expressed as dry PE (g)/EC (g) was 0.37\u00b10.07 in MPL1-T20, 0.74\u00b10.02 in MPL2-T20, 1.47\u00b10.04 in MPL3-T20 and 2.93\u00b10.1 at MPL4-T20, while in MPLs prepared with T80 as hydrophilic surfactant it was 0.33\u00b10.05 in MPL1-T80, 0.73\u00b10.12 in MPL2-T80, 1.41\u00b10.22 in MPL3-T80 and 3.35\u00b10.23 in MPL4-T80. It can be concluded that increment of PE/EC resulted with increased PC most likely due to the higher amount of PE available for encapsulation into MPLs. Significant difference was observed among all samples except MPL1-T20/MPL1-T80, MPL2-T20/MPL2-T80 and MPL3-T20/MPL3-T80 (one way ANOVA, Fisher\u2019s LSD, p<0.05). Dissolution studies pointed that release of PE from MPLs was continued for 3-4 hours, indicating prolonged release compared to PE alone (immediately dissolved). Dissolution profile comparison using pairwise procedure - f2 similarity factor, resulted with f2 values >50 in all tested formulations except MPL1-T20/MPL1-T80. It can be an-ticipated that lack of similarity is most likely related to the difference in their particle size.Drug release data best fitted to model of Peppas and Sahlin, a model accounted for the coupled effects of Ficki-an diffusion and case II transport. However, a negative K1 value indicated insignificant effect of Fickian diffusion on drug release.ConclusionMPLs loaded with 25% PE were prepared by dou-ble emulsion solvent diffusion technique. Influence of the amount of used propolis (PE/EC= 0.5, 1, 2 and 4) and type of hydrophilic surfactants (T20 and T80) on MPLs prop-erties was evaluated. By subsequent incorporation of pre-pared MPLs into gel system additional prolongation of PE release could be achieved, thus resulting with a topical dos-age form with appropriate controlled released properties in favor of efficient acne treatment.

Macedonia* veronika.stoilkovska@gmail.comIntroductionSt. John\u2019s Wort Oil (Hyperici Oleum) is a traditional herbal preparation which is prepared by fatty oil macera-tion of the flowering aerial parts of Hypericum perforatum Linn. (fam.Hypericaceae) in sunlight for several weeks (EMEA/HMPC/101303/2008). It is used mainly external-ly for the treatment of wounds, especially burn wounds, bruises and swellings. Internally, it is used to treat dyspep-sia (Kovar and Maisenbacher, 1992). In the Ph. Eur. official are St John\u2019s Wort (Hyperici herba) and St. John\u2019s Wort dry extract, quantified (Hyperici herba extractum siccum), but not St. John\u2019s Wort Oil (Hy-perici oleum) (Any\u017cewska et al., 2010). St. John\u2019s Wort Oil (Hyperici Oleum) is official according to the German Commission E and Swiss Pharmacopoeia. These pharma-copoeias suggest spectrophotometric determination where hypericin content is expressed as sum of all derivatives of hypericin like hypericin, pseudohypericin, protohyper-icin and isohypericin (Any\u017cewska et al., 2010, EMEA/HMPC/101303/2008).Hypericin which is naphtodiantrone, has specific pro-tonation and deprotonation behavior. The protonation be-havior of carbonyl groups is assigned to the pKa= -6, depro-tonation of OH groups in position 3 and 4 to the pKa= 2 and second deprotonation assigned to the pKa= 9, which gener-ates diphenolate ion by ionization of one of the OH groups in position 1, 6, 8 or 13. This indicates that hypericin is pres-ent as an anion under most circumstances due to its rather low pKa value of 2 (Wirz, 2000). Specific conditioning of Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) cartridges is crucial since it positively charges the stationary surface with which bond-ing of hypericin is enabled and separation from the vegeta-ble oil is possible, which is one of the main challenges. The aim of this study is to develop HPLC method for quantitative determination of hypericin in St John\u2019s Wort oil using solid phase extraction as sample preparation method and compare it to the official spectrophotometric pharmacopoeial method. Materials and methodsPlant material: Aerial flowering parts of wild H. per-foratum populations were collected from locality Stracin, R. Macedonia. Preparation of Hyperici Oleum: Herbal drug (crushed, fresh flowers and dry upper aerial part) and vegetable oil (sunflower oil) ratio was 1:4. The transparent glass jars containing the herbal drug and vegetable oil were left at sunny place for 6 weeks. Afterwards the herbal drug was pressed out and oil extracts were collected in dark, cylin-drical flasks (EMEA/HMPC/101303/2008). Primary reference standard hypericin was purchased from HWi Analytik GmbH, R\u00fclzheim, Germany with 89.73% purity. Methanolic solution of the standard (0.006 mg/mL) was prepared (Hm). Solution of hypericin stan-dard in sunflower oil (0.006 mg/mL) was prepared (Ho). For SPE, n-hexane dilution of Ho was done (H1=0.006 mg/mL and H2=0.003 mg/mL). 2 mL of each, commercial St. John\u2019s Wort oil (B1) or St. John\u2019s Wort oil (crushed fresh flowers in sunflower oil) (B2) were diluted to 10 mL with n-hexane. For the spiked sample (B3), 1 ml Ho and 1 ml B1 were diluted to 5 mL with n-hexane. Sample preparation was done using solid-phase ami-nopropylsilica extraction cartridges (Sep-Pak\u00ae, 6cc, 500 mg sorbent), which were conditioned sequentially with 10 mL each of 0.01 N NaOH, methanol, acetone and n-hex-ane (Kovar and Maisenbacher, 1992). Samples were load-ed on SPE-NH2 cartridges using vacuum manifold and S8 OP 301632Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 631 - 632 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessionthen the cartridge bed was rinsed with 12 mL of n-hex-ane. Elution was done with 4 mL 5 % (m/V) oxalic acid in acetone:methanol (1:1 V/V) (Eoa) or with mobile phase (Emp). For HPLC analysis the following eluates were ob-tained: EmpH1, EmpH2, EmpB1, EoaB1, EmpB2, EoaB2, EmpB3 and EoaB3.The chromatographic analyses were carried out using Agilent 1200 HPLC equipped with DAD G1315D, quater-nary pump G1311A, column thermostat G1316A and ther-mostatted autosampler G1329A. Separation was achieved using Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 \u03bcm). The isocratic mobile phase at a flow 1 mL/min con-sisted of 78 mL ethyl acetate, 82 mL sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution adjusted to pH 2 with phosphoric acid and 360 mL methanol. Injection volume was 20 \u03bcL and the wavelength of detection was 590 nm. The separation was performed at 40\u02daC (Monograph of St. John\u2019s Wort dry ex-tract; Ph. Eur.8).For spectrophotometric measurements a Perkin- Elmer UV/ VIS spectrophotometer Lambda 16 was used. Results and discussionWith SPE procedure, the vegetable oil was successful-ly separated and the phytocomponents were clearly eluated into the eluates, with characteristic red colour.With HPLC analysis of EmpH1, EmpH2, EmpB3 and EoaB3 eluates a peak of hypericin was identified, with Rt and UV/ VIS spectrum corresponding to the results ob-tained by HPLC analysis of the methanolic solution of the hypericin standard (Hm). Relative peak intensity of the tar-get component- hypericin was higher in Emp eluates com-pared to Eoa eluates. By analysis of EmpH1, EmpH2, EmpB3 and EoaB3 satisfactory selectivity of the SPE pro-cedure and HPLC method for hypericin were proven. HPLC analysis of EmpB1, EoaB1, EmpB2, EoaB2 did not reveal any peak corresponding to hypericin, suggesting that target component may not be present in form of hyper-icin in St. John\u2019s Wort Oil. Possible reason for missing peak from hypericin in the HPLC analyses might be due to photolysis when exposed to sunlight several weeks during preparation of Hyperici oleum. This thesis is also suggested from Maisenbacher et al. (1992) who had examined a solution of hypericin in ac-etone after irradiation with a daylight lamp for 40 h and by UV/ VIS, IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy have given as-sumption of the basic structure of lipophilic hypericin- de-rivatives generated by photolysis of hypericin. It was sug-gested that St. John\u2019s Wort Oil red colour comes from the lipophilic breakdown products of hypericin (Kovar and Maisenbacher, 1992).On the other hand, with spectrophotometry method proposed in Ph. Helv. 11.0 the obtained results complied with the pharmacopoeial criteria and indicated presence of hypericin in the samples H2, B1 and B2. Presence of unidentified compounds detected in the HPLC chromatogram of St. John\u2019s Wort Oil indicated that further research should be done in order to explain the pos-sible chemical modification of hypericin like derivatives.ConclusionWithin this research, SPE procedure was successful-ly applied for separating hypericin and other phytocompo-nents from vegetable oil solution. Hypericin was not de-tected in St. John\u2019s Wort Oil by the proposed HPLC meth-od, although the content of hypericin derivatives, deter-mined by spectrophotometric method, was in compliance with the Ph. Helv 11.0. Analysis of the obtained results suggests possibility that the target component hypericin may undergo chemical modification as unidentified peaks were detected in the chromatogram of St. John\u2019s Wort Oil. Further analysis of different preparation methods for St. John\u2019s Wort Oil and their affection to hypericin content, stability testing of hypericin in vegetable oil, as well as quantitative and qualitative determination of the possible degradation products of hypericin are requiredReferencesAny\u017cewska, M., Fija\u0142ek, Z., Kowalczuk, A., Jab\u0142czu\u0144ska, R., \u0141ozak, A., 2010.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* belma.asanova@hotmail.comIntroduction\u0410 new core-shell silica particles were developed as a material for chromatographic stationary phases that can separate small and large molecules and complex samples, providing fast and high efficiency separations at pressures compatible with conventional HPLC equipment (Guiochon and Gritti, 2011). Core shell particles (also called fused-core\u2122 particles, shell particles or controlled-surface-po-rosity particles) consist of a non porous silica core and a narrow shell of porous silica. Compared with convention-al columns with fully porous particles, core shell particles provide shorter diffusion paths of the analytes into the sta-tionary phase which significantly influence the separation parameters (Berger, 2011; Destefano et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2013). Core-shell columns have been mostly used for reversed-phase HPLC, as well as in hydrophilic interac-tion liquid chromatography (HILIC), chiral separation, two dimensional liquid chromatography and capillary electro-chromatography separation (Kirkland et al., 2013; Ruta et al., 2012). Transfer of the HPLC methods from columns packed with fully porous silica particles to core-shell col-umns provide significant time and cost savings, while maintaining column performance and minimizing operat-ing difficulties (Hayes et al., 2014).The aim of our work was to transfer the method for determination of related substances of metamizole sodi-um using the method described in the Ph.Eur. monograph (01/2008:1346) from conventional to core-shell column and to optimize the method for determination of related substances of metamizole in tablets.Materials and methodsChemicals and standards Metamizole sodium and metamizole impurity A, cer-tified reference standards, were purchased from EDQM (Strasbourg, France). Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, (Ph.Eur., grade for analysis) and triethylamine were purchased from Merck, Germany. Methanol (HPLC grade) was pur-chased from Carlo Erba Reagents, France. Water R, was obtained with a TKA-LAB Reinstwasser system (Nie-derelbert, Germany). Chromatographic Conditions HPLC separation was performed on Agilent 1200 LC Systems, using ChemStation software, Version B.04.03 for data acquisition and instrument control. The column used for the separation was Kinetex XB-C18, 50 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 \u03bcm (Phenomenex, Inc). Mixture of 28 volumes of meth-anol R and 72 volumes of a buffer solution containing 1000 volumes of a 6.0 g/L solution of sodium dyhidrogen phos-phate R and 1 volume of triethylamine R, pH 7.0, was used as a mobile phase. The column temperature was 25\u00b0C. Flow rate was 0.2 mL/min. Injection volume was 0.5 \u03bcL.

Reference solutions used for calculations were pre-pared according to the method for related substances de-scribed in Ph.Eur. monograph 01/2008:1346.Validation of the methodValidation of the method was performed according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guide-line on Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology (ICH, 2005).Results and discussionThe method for simultaneous determination of met-amizole sodium and its two impurities (A and C) described in Ph.Eur. monograph (01/2008:1346) was transferred from conventional fully porous column (base deactivated octadecylsilyl silica gel for chromatography R, 0.25 m x 4.6 mm; 5 \u03bcm) to column based on core-shell technology (XB-C18, 50 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 \u03bcm) and optimized for de-termination of  related substances of metamizole in tablets. Satisfactory system suitability requirements were ob-tained in total analysis time of 9 minutes (4.5 times of the retention time of metamizole, Rt = 2.15) and the value for resolution (Rs) between metamizole and impurity A (Rs = 3.11) fulfills the requirement of the Ph.Eur monograph (Rs \u2265 2.5). The purity ratio was within the calculated thresh-old limit (1.000) for both impurity A (0.128) and impuri-ty C (0.0197), confirming the purity of the peaks and spec-ificity of the method. The obtained values for number of theoretical plates (N=10187), retention factor (k\u2019=1.88), symmetry factor (As=1.28) and relative standard deviation (RSD(Rt)=0.16%; RSD(peak area)=0.53%; n=6) for the peak of metamizole impurity A, indicate on a satisfactory column efficiency and adequate performance of the chro-matographic system. The results obtained from the regression analysis of the peak area (y) versus concentration (x), confirmed the linearity of the method (y = 6,476x + 2,417; R2 = 0.9999) in concentration range from 5 \u03bcg /mL to 50 \u03bcg /mL of met-amisole impurity A (5, 10, 20, 25, 30, and 50 \u03bcg/mL). The values for limit of detection (DL=0.33 \u00b5g/mL) and limit of quantification (QL= 0.99 \u00b5g/mL), determined from the residual standard deviation of the regression line and the slope are below the disregard limit (1.25 \u00b5g/mL) given in the Ph.Eur. monograph, indicating on satisfactory sensitiv-ity of the method. The repeatability of the method was confirmed from the values for the relative standard deviation (RSD), ob-tained from determination of the test solution (RSD = 2.26 %, n=6). Recovery values obtained from the determination of metamizole impurity A (81.3 % - 90.4 %) in the test so-lution (spiked with metamizole impurity A, at three differ-ent concentrations) confirmed that the method was accu-rate in the range of 80-120% of the working concentration. The results from the determination of the robustness of the method indicated that small but deliberate changes in the analytical conditions did not affect the system suitabil-ity parameters and that the method can be applied in rou-tine work.ConclusionThe results have shown that the optimized method us-ing core-shell column is suitable for determination of re-lated substances of metamizole in tablets containing met-amizole sodium, providing fast and highly efficient sepa-ration on conventional HPLC equipment, available in al-most any laboratory.ReferencesBerger, T.A., 2011.

Macedonia* angela.arso@gmail.comIntroductionThe pharmacy profession is facing continuous evolve-ment toward patient (PT) oriented health care services in or-der to ensure the safe, effective and rational use of medi-cines. The areas of pharmacist practice are versatile - from activities concerned with PT care and public health to drug design and development, supply and dispensing (Traulsen and Almarsdottir, 2005). Currently 2413 pharmacists are li-censed at the pharmaceutical chamber of R. Macedonia, where 1107 are employed in CPs across the country (data obtained from Pharmaceutical chamber of Macedonia on 22.02.2016).  Having in mind that a major area of licensed pharmacist (LP) settlements in R. Macedonia are CPs (~46% of all LPs), we conducted a survey (20.10.2014-20.01.2015) in order to establish a baseline in respect of CP activity, staff-ing, infrastructure etc. We hope that the results of the con-ducted survey will help for further development of CP sector.Materials and methodsFocus-methodology group approach was applied in the process of design and structuring of the questionnaire. It was conducted between 1-10 October, 2014 on 10 LP employed at CPs across the country in order to explore the level of understanding, acceptability (questions wording, complexity and ambiguity of proposed answers) as well as the time required to complete the questionnaire. After-wards the final questionnaire with 29 items was structured.The anonymous questionnaire covers data related to socio-demographic factors (city, age, gender and length of time registered as a LP), average number of PTs and pre-scriptions (Px) in the CP per week, location and workforce in the CP, services offered, continuing education and expe-riences and opinions related to e- Px. The questionnaire was distributed to 150 CPs across the country and 124 were returned. Only one questionnaire was in a group with more than 20% missing values and therefore 123 questionnaires were analyzed.Obtained data were tabulated using Microsoft Excel\u00ae (Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA, USA) and were comput-ed and consequently evaluated using statistical software STATGRAPHICS Centurion XVI evaluation (StatPoint technologies Inc., USA)Results and discussionAccording to the data found on the web site of Mace-donian Agency for Drugs and Medicinal Products (http://malmed.gov.mk) there are 1019 registered pharmacies in R. Macedonia of which 846 (83%) are CPs (web site ac-cessed at 24.02.2016). The analyzed sample of 123 CPs covers 14.54% of all CPs in R. Macedonia pointing to sat-isfactory margin over target of necessary 10% to have re-liable results.Related to the profile of LP employed in CPs the av-erage age was 36.24 \u00b1 9.89 years of which 96.7% were females. The average length of time registered as a LP was 10 \u00b1 8.9 years. Only 2.4% have degree of postgradu-ate health-care specialist, and 1.6% were enrolled in such study at the time of survey.Most of the surveyed CPs (48.4%) were visited by up to 1000 PTs per week followed by those with 1000-2499 PTs (41.8%). The average number of dispensed Px items per week 500-999 (47.5%) preceded the ones with low-er than 500 (40.8%). Majority of the respondents (45.4%) stated that the number of dispensed Px per week issued by general practitioners was 500-900 while the specialists in 55.4% cases issued in average 100-499.  Most of the CPs S8 OP 303636Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 635 - 636 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent session(60%) were visited by medium number of PTs from all age groups (56.9%). The average working time per day (Mon. to Sat.) was 13.22\u00b11.35 hours, where 30% have open-ing hours from 8:00-21:00 h, 15.83% from 8:00-22:00 h and 10% from 7:30-21:00 h. Sunday was working day in 35.83% of surveyed CPs with 7.15\u00b12.03 working hours on average with only 3.33% working 12 or more hours.  Only 8.1% of the respondents worked within small chain (up to 3 CP), where majority (69.7%) worked in large chain and the rest of 22.1% worked in single CPs. CP location in 46.3% of the cases was in central city region and in 21.1% near the general practitioner and/or hospital (15.4%). The findings related to workforce indicated that aver-age number of total staff per CP was 4\u00b11.52 persons.  On average, there were 2.34 \u00b1 1.04 LPs reported as working in each CP with the most common response (mode) being 2 (39.2%) while the maximum reported number of LPs was 5. In 21.7% of cases only one LP was employed. Isolat-ed consultation/counseling area for PTs was not available in 86.3% of the CPs.  Only 7.4% CPs dispensed in-house compounded medications. Related to medication (MED) therapy management, 61.7% of the LPs would like to have information about previous use of the certain MED, 37.4% if the PT knows how to use the MED, 34.6% were there any allergies or in-tolerances noted, 33.6% about other used MEDs and only 4.7% were asking the PT if he/she was familiar with pos-sible side/adverse effects of the drug dispensed. Preferenc-es about the drug manufacturer were asked in 19.6%. LPs in 93.5% of the cases audited possible physicians\u2019 errors, 71.5% check out drug interactions, 74% allergy to the pre-scribed drug or its excipients,  51.2% other allergies pres-ent  and something else in 14.6%. MED therapy errors were solved and evidenced in 64.4%, while in 32.2% were solved but not evidenced. Only 9.4% of the respondents re-ported adverse drug reactions. More than 90% of the respondents advised PTs for eye drops and inhaler use, \u223c82% for pregnancy testing, \u223c40% for insulin pen and \u223c28% for other matters. Drug use instruc-tions were written on MED package by \u223c97% of the LPs. Respondents\u2019 opinion about the availability of infor-mation needed for efficient MED therapy management was as follows: - all of them would like to know if there is history of drug related allergies and ~80% about other allergies pres-ent,  where more than 56% appreciated to obtain the in-formation both from the PT and medical dossier,- diagnosis was stated to be valuable by ~87% while med-ical history (past 6 months) was valued by 58.5%. Med-ical dossier as source was selected by more than 50%,- adverse drug reactions was found to be valuable for 97.3%, and both medical dossier and PT as source by 39.1%,- discharge summary and results from screening and lab-oratory tests were valued by ~41%, 29% and 52% re-spectively and medical dossier as source by ~64%, 60% and 71% of the respondents accordingly. PT adherence to chronic therapy was followed via di-rect PT questioning by 70% of the respondents.Blood glucose could be monitored in 18.7%, while blood pressure in 35.8% of surveyed CPs. Health promo-tions (eg. colon cancer, nutrition dietetic regimens) and pregnancy advices were practiced in 18.7% and 36.6% of the cases respectively. Nearly 84% responded that PTs were seeking advic-es for smoking cessation and nutrition, ~65% for vaccines, and ~55% were asked regarding alcohol drinking as well as physical activity. More than 95% of the respondents stated that PTs sought an advice concerning drugs cur-rently used, side/adverse drug reaction, change of therapy/treatment, health related issues in general and herbal drugs. Urgent contraception, dietetic regimen in time of ongoing therapy, MED storage conditions and need of physician visit were issues of PTs` interest in more than 80% of the cases. Nearly 60% of the respondents stated that they were asked about therapy monitoring and ~66% about new ap-proved drugs. Only 26.2% responded that unwanted medicines were returned to CP for disposal.Survey for PTs` experience from CP work and activi-ties in the past year was conducted in 16.1%, but howev-er 51.3% stated that they were planning to conduct such a survey in the future.  PTs ` compliant procedure was estab-lished in 26.5% of the surveyed CPs. Continuing education preferences were expressed by 75% of the respondents, but however when it comes to the type and topic, response rate from the surveyed LPs was relatively low, 52.8% and 37.4% respectively. From those responded 84.6% preferred conventional lectures, semi-nars, symposia, congresses, and only 10.8% e-education. Topics related to new approved drugs and CP practice & communication were preferred by 21.7% and 19.6% from the respondents, accordingly.  The vast majority of the respondents were satisfied by introduction and use of e- Px. Only 25% of the surveyed LPs provided their opinion in relation to CP work improvement where 29% of the re-spondents suggested less administrative tasks, e- Px only and PTs` part in the e- Px to be automatically filled by data already present in the system and 22.6% suggested to make clear distinction between duties of LPs and pharmaceutical technicians working in CPs, as well as different person re-sponsible for Px and OTC drugs.ConclusionThis study enabled baseline establishment for the cur-rent situation in CP practice in R. Macedonia. The results could be used for further development and improvement of CPs sector in our country.ReferencesTraulsen, J.M., Almarsdottir, A.B., 2005.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* stefanm_bt@hotmail.comIntroductionBackground and Aims:  Antibiotics have always been considered one of the wonder discoveries of the 20th cen-tury. This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antimi-crobial resistance in hospitals, communities, and the en-vironment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefited from man\u2019s overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically or oth-erwise (Davies and Davies, 2010). Resistance mechanisms have been identified and described for all known antimi-crobials. Acquired bacterial antibiotic resistance can result from the mutation of normal cellular genes, the acquisition of foreign resistance genes, or a combination. The most common resistance mechanisms employed by bacteria in-clude enzymatic degradation or alteration of the antimicro-bial, mutation in the antimicrobial target site, decreased cell wall permeability to the antimicrobial, and active ef-flux of the antimicrobial (Harbottle et al., 2006).  With re-spect to the pediatric population, respiratory tract infec-tions (RTIs) are a common reason for health care provider visits and the primary reason for antimicrobials prescrib-ing in this population. The overuse of antibiotics in chil-dren is becoming a major public health problem. Although most of the common childhood infections, such as the up-per respiratory tract infections, are caused by viruses, large volumes of antibiotics are prescribed for these infections in children in the primary care setting. It is estimated that 90% of upper respiratory tract infections are self-limiting viral illnesses and even bacterial infections like acute otitis media often run a self-limiting course. Clinical trials have shown that antibiotic use to treat common upper respirato-ry tract infection like sore throat, nasopharyngitis and oti-tis media has no or minimal benefit on the clinical outcome (Kutty, 2011). Given the proven relationship between the resistance rate of a specific pathogen and the rate of antibi-otic usage (community setting and nosocomial), the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance rate to specific an-tibiotics in common respiratory tract pathogens in pediat-ric population in R. Macedonia. Materials and methodsRetrospective analysis of medical data from 7079 pa-tients was done in the period July 2013 \u2013 January 2014. The analyzed isolates were taken from: nose (2141), throat, epipharynx, pharynx, deep swab from pharynx, tonsils (2752); drainage secretions (2186). The testing was per-formed by the Cabinet for microbiological analysis, Insti-tute for respiratory diseases in children - \u201eKozle\u201d (Skopje). Data from sensitivity tests (antibiograms) were analyzed for 6 RTIs pathogens - Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococ-cus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Staphy-lococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherich-ia coli. The isolates were obtained using standard microbi-ological procedures and screened using disc-diffusion test. Sensitivity was tested to penicillins (Amoxicillin, Oxacil-lin), cephalosporins (Cefadroxil, Cefuroxime, Cefixime, Ceftriaxone) and macrolides (Azithromycin, Clarithromy-cin, Erythromycin). The antibiotics were selected based on the institute\u2019s prescription practices for RTIs. The patho-gen sensitivity to a specific antibiotic in the antibiogram reports was numerically labeled - 3 (sensitive), 2 (moder-S8 OP 304638Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 637 - 638 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessionately sensitive), 0 (resistant). Data from oxacillin test (3/0) were analyzed for Streptococcus pneumoniae. A basic sta-tistical analysis was performed to calculate the resistance rate (percentage value) of every individual pathogen to ev-ery specific antibiotic. The resistance rate (lack of suscep-tibility) was calculated by dividing the number of isolates with an identified resistant pathogen (numerically labeled as 0 in the antibiogram reports) and the total number of iso-lates of that given pathogen.    Results and discussionMoraxella catarrhalis demonstrated 9.5% resistance rate to Cefixime, and an average resistance to macro-lides - 10-12%. Streptococcus pneumoniae had a sizeable (30.9%) resistance rate to Cefixime, 38-43% to macrolides, and a dramatically high (70.1%) resistance rate on the Ox-acillin test. The oxacillin test for S.pneumoniae is consid-ered a test for penicillin susceptibility in the first place, but unsusceptible isolates are also considered unsuscep-tible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (e.g. Ceftriax-one or Cefotaxime). Haemophilus influenzae demonstrat-ed significant resistance to Cefixime (10.6%). There were no cases of resistance to Amoxicillin. Staphylococcus au-reus showed a substantial (14-23%) resistance rate to the macrolides. Streptococcus pyogenes showed no resistance to any of the tested antibacterial agents. Escherichia coli showed a very high resistance rate to the class of chepal-osporins: Cefadroxil - 77.8%, Cefuroxime - 61.5%, Cefix-ime - 71.3%, and Ceftriaxone - 67.3%. The study revealed a 28-35% resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to the group of cephalosporins. K. pneumoniae is considered in-trinsically resistant to amoxicillin. If on the other hand, we take into account the data for antimicrobials consumption in Europe for the aforemen-tioned period - a causative relationship between the antimi-crobials use and the rate of antimicrobial resistance could clearly be established. For example, in 2011, Greece was on the first place with antimicrobials consumption in Eu-rope (35 DDD/1000/day), and at the same time the data for antimicrobials resistance rates in Greece demonstrat-ed very high values for various isolates. The same could be concluded for Cyprus and other countries that are po-sitioned on the top of the list for antimicrobials consump-tion. Contrary to this, Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia and the Scandinavian countries, which are positioned on the bot-tom of the same list, are also the countries in Europe with the least percentage of antimicrobial resistance (EARS-Net Annual Report, 2013). The situation in Macedonia was much like that in Greece and Cyprus. The consumption of antimicrobials for the period 2008-2012 was approximately 32 DDD/1000/day. For that period, the most commonly utilized antibi-otics were the beta-lactams. During this time, the con-sumption of antimicrobials dropped compared to the pre-vious period for all groups of antibiotics, except for the penicillins, where an increase was noticed. The most com-monly prescribed anti-infective agent for systemic use was Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin followed on the second place, whereas Cefuroxime and Cefixime placed fourth and fifth. Ciprofloxacin was positioned on the third place (Annual report 2012, Health Insurance Fund of Macedonia). Furthermore, also to be considered is the fact that in the time of conduction of this research, Cefix-ime was the only oral third-generation cephalosporin reg-istered in Macedonia, and even more, available as a pedi-atric oral suspension. To this, could partially be attributed the observed great percentage of resistance to Cefixime.  If we take into consideration the data obtained in this research, we can clearly postulate that the high consump-tion of antimicrobials in Macedonia could be in a great manner responsible for the substantial percentage of an-timicrobial resistance, by constantly increasing the ever-growing positive pressure on microorganisms to continu-ously acquire new means of resistance.ConclusionThe results from the susceptibility tests on one side, and the total antibiotics use (32 DDD/1000/day) in the Macedonian population on the other, proved the previous-ly stated proportional relationship between the population antibiotics consumption level and pathogen resistance rate.

Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* nkllazarevski@yahoo.comIntroductionRisperidone (RPD) is an antipsychoticdrug commonly used for the treatment of schizophrenia. The treatment for this disease is generally life-long, so the oral route is the most convenient and non-invasive way of drug administra-tion. However, RPD is a poorly water-soluble BCS class II drug that undergoes extensive first-pass hepatic metab-olism and has poor oral bioavailability. Moreover, it binds about 90% to plasma proteins, which renders its delivery across the blood-brain barrier (Kumar et al., 2009).Literature data suggests that nanoparticles could avoid the first-pass effect and provide prolonged release, thus enabling significant reduction of the RPD dose and min-imising its undesired side-effects (Patel et al., 2011). Lip-id nanoparticles are a promising strategy for drug deliv-ery to the brain due to their rapid uptake, bio-acceptabili-ty, biodegradability and lower toxicity compared to poly-meric nanoparticles. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are an improved generation of lipid carriers that are pre-ferred over conventional lipid formulations and solid lip-id nanoparticles due to their enhanced properties for drug loading, modulation of the drug release profile and im-proved physical stability (Alam et al., 2015). Additional-ly, the small size, unique drug incorporation abilities, ste-ric propertiesand possibilities for surface modification of NLCs favour brain targeting and delivery.The presented study focuses on the formulation opti-misation of surface stabilised RPD loaded NLCs and their characterisation in terms of particle size, particle size dis-tribution and drug encapsulation efficiency.Materials and methodsMaterialsCutina\u00ae GMS V PH (GMS) was kindly donated by Cognis, Germany. Miglyol 812 and Phospholipon 90G (Ph 90G) were purchased from Sasol, Germany and Lipoid, Germany, respectively. Sodium glycocholate (SGH) and Tween 80 were obtained from NutriScience Innovations, LLC, USA and Merck, Germany, respectively. Poloxam-er 407, Poloxamer 188 and PEG 6000 were a generous gift from BASF, Germany. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Risperidone (RPD) was purchased from Teva-Tech, Israel. All the oth-er chemicals and reagents were of the highest purity grade commercially available and used as received.Preparation of NLCsDifferent formulations of blank NLCs were prepared using melt emulsification and rotor-stator homogenisation technique. Optimised formulation (sample 1) (central com-posite design: blocked cube star) composed of 2.5% GMS, 2.5% Miglyol812, 0.75% Ph 90G and 0.2% SGH was se-lected by minimising both responses, mean particle diame-ter (D50) and particle size distribution expressed in terms of SPAN factor. Briefly, the lipid phase was melted by heat-ing to ~80 \u00b0C and dispersed in an aqueous phase containing SGH, preheated at the same temperature, under high shear homogenisation (7 min, 24.000 rpm) using Ultra-Turrax\u00ae T25 (Ika-Werke, Germany). Subsequently, the dispersion was allowed to recrystallize at 5 \u00b0C for 1 h. In order to turn the hydrophobic NLC surface into a more hydrophilic one, sample 1 was further modified by incorporating different concentrations (4.0, 4.5, 5.0 and S8 OP 305640Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 639 - 640 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent session5.5% w/w) of Tween 80 (samples 1A1-4), Poloxamer 407 (sample 1B1-4), Poloxamer 188 (sample 1C1-4) or PEG 6000 (sample 1D1-4) in the aqueous phase, prior to the high-shear homogenisation. Sample 1A4, prepared with 5.5% Tween 80 was selected for preparation of RPD load-ed NLCs, based on the results obtained from in vitro pro-tein adsorption studies. Drug loaded NLCs were prepared using the same procedure as described above, by adding different concentrations of RPD (drug/lipid mass ratio 1, 10 and 20%; samples R1, R10 and R20, respectively) to the melted lipid phase prior to the high-shear homogenisation.Characterisation of NLCsThe objective of the protein adsorption studies was to determine the amount of adsorbed BSA on the surface of NLCs prepared with different types and concentrations of stabilisers. Briefly, 100 \u00b5l aliquots of the prepared sam-pleswere incubated with 2mg of BSA in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH=7.4) for 1 h on shaking water bath (37 \u00b0C, 75 rpm). After adsorption, the unbound protein was sepa-rated by centrifugal ultrafiltration through three washing cy-cles using Vivaspin 20, 1000 KDa (15 min, 4000 rpm; Het-tich, Rotofix 32, Germany). Afterwards, the volume of sam-ples was condensed to the initial volume of NLC dispersions. The adsorbed amount of BSA/mg lipid was calculated indi-rectly by determining the total amount of protein remaining in the filtrate by UV spectroscopy (595 nm; Bio-Rad\u2019s Mod-el 3550-UV Microplate Reader) after reaction with Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, USA), based on the method of Brad-ford (microtiter plate protocol) and subsequent subtraction from the initial BSA amount. The particle size (D50) and par-ticle size distribution (SPAN) of the prepared NLCs were de-termined by laser diffractometry (Mastersizer 2000, Hydro 2000S, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). In order to determine the drug content (mg RPD/g lipid) and encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of RPD in the NLCs, the particles in the suspension were separated by centrifugal ultrafiltration through three washing cycles using Vivaspin 20, 1000 KDa (15 min, 4000 rpm; Hettich, Rotofix 32, Ger-many) and brake-opened using methanol. The solution was then passed through a 0.45 \u00b5m filter and analysed by re-verse-phased HPLC method (Agilent HPLC system, 1200 Series; column: Waters Spherisorb ODS-2; 150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m). The used mobile phase was consisted of meth-anol, acetate buffer (0.05M, pH=4.6) and triethanolamine (60:40:0.02, v/v/v) with flow rate of 1 ml/min at 25.0\u00b10.5 \u00b0C. The injection volume was 50 \u00b5l and the detection was car-ried out at 280 nm. The EE% was calculated from the total amount of drug in the nanoparticle suspension and the quan-tity of RPD added initially during the preparation.Results and discussionIn the development of site-specific drug delivery sys-tems it is a prerequisite to identify the factors determining the carriers\u2019 in vivo behaviour and disposition. For effective brain targeting, NLCs should have a hydrophilic surface, reduced protein adsorption pattern and prolonged blood cir-culatory time in order to permit efficient and satisfied inter-actions and penetration in the brain endothelial cells.Considerable differences in BSA adsorption onto NLCs surface were detected for different stabilizers in a concentration-dependent manner and in all cases the to-tal protein adsorption was lower compared to unmodified NLCs (sample 1). NLCs prepared with Tween 80 (samples 1A1-4) resulted with lowest amount of adsorbed BSA (sur-factant concentrations: 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 and 5.5%; unbound BSA: 46.5, 65.4, 68.2 and 94.9%, respectively). The ob-tained results are in accordance with the literature data pointing that the presence of Tween 80 could minimise the interaction of the nanoparticles with serum albumin and prolong their half-life in the blood circulation (G\u00f6ppert and Rainer, 2005), potentially giving NLCs best stealth charac-teristics compared to other formulations. Therefore, sam-ple 1A4, prepared with 5.5% of Tween 80 was selected for preparation of RPD loaded NLCs.The obtained unmodified NLCs (sample 1) had D50 of 107 nm and SPAN factor of 0.804 with unimodal narrow size distribution. There were no significant differences in D50 between unmodified and surface-modified particles. The D50 and SPAN of RPD loaded NLCs were 116 nm and 0.832 (sample R1), 127 nm and 0.959 (sample R10) and 123 nm and 1.012 (sample R20), respectively.The determined drug content in the prepared formula-tions was 8.8, 99.9 and 227.5 mg RPD/g lipid and the EE was 87.2, 89.9 and 91% for R1, R10 and R20, respectively. It is obvious that higher drug concentration used for prepar-ing the samples resulted with increased drug content, thus pointing that the drug/lipid ratio was a critical parameter for efficient RPD loading into the NLCs.ConclusionIn an attempt to realise the \u2018magic bullet\u2019 concept postulated by Ehrlich, the presented study indicates that Tween 80 stabilised NLCs could be suitable risperidone carriers with prolonged blood circulation time and site-specific brain delivery.ReferencesAlam, T., Pandit, J., Vohora, D., Aqil, M., Ali, A., Sultana, Y., 2015.

With the aging of the world population, brain-based disorders, especially neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s are becoming one of the major health problems. However, brain is the most difficult organ for drug delivery and poses unique challenges. Specific anatomic and physiological features of the cerebrovasculature and cerebral tissue fluids result in barriers, i.e. blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which limits the penetration of many molecules/substances including drugs to the central nervous system. Molecular characteristics, which are known to reduce the ability for partition/penetrance into the lipids of the cell membranes (through the BBB) are, a significant polarity, high potential for hydrogen bond formation, molecular weight of more than 500 kDa, as well as molecular structures which contain rotatable bonds and those that are highly branched (Haque et al., 2012; Mutlu et al., 2011). Accordingly, the development of brain drug-delivery systems is imperative. Among different particulate carri-er systems, liposomes have gained much attention because of their biocompatibility and structural similarity to that of cells. Liposomes can fuse with cells, facilitating the trans-port of drugs across biomembranes. Also, liposomes pos-sess excellent criteria as drug carriers, because they are closed vesicles composed of an internal aqueous compart-ment and an external lipophilic bilayer of phospholipids molecules. External surface of liposomes can be modified by polyethylene glycol (PEG) to produce stealth properties. Stealth liposomes are characterized by long circulation time in vivo and could be easily coupled to different targeting moieties in order to improve the site-specific drug delivery.Having in mind the limitations of currently available drugs for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, devel-opment of phytopharmaceutical based liposomes could be considered as an attractive alternative approach for effica-cious treatment of brain disorders. Natural polyphenols are well known organic compounds with antioxidative, free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory characteristics. In this connection, polyphenols are thought to be potential candidates in prevention and treatment of diseases caused by oxidative damage, such as neurodegenerative disorders (Mignet et al., 2013). However, they exhibit low bioavail-ability and poor solubility, which limits their use. Therefore, the aim of this study was design and formulation of PEGylated liposomes containing rosmarinic extract in order to enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of polyphenols in treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.Materials and methodsMaterials Soybean lecithin (SL) was purchased from Vitalia, Macedonia. LIPOID PE 18:0/18:0-PEG 2000 (PEG) was kindly donated from Lipoid, Germany. Cholesterol (CH) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Rosmarin-ic extract (RA-E) was a generous gift from the Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Skopje, Macedonia. All the other chemicals and reagents were of the highest pu-rity grade commercially available and used as received.S8 OP 306642Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 641 - 642 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessionPreparation of liposomesDuring the preliminary studies, different formulations of liposomes were prepared in order to obtain vesicles with mean size of ~200 nm suitable for brain delivery (Gelden-huys et al., 2015). Optimized process parameters\u2019 were fur-ther used for formulation modification. Samples were pre-pared by the modified lipid film hydration technique. Brief-ly, required amounts of SL and CH (mass ratio=5:1, 10:1 and 20:1; samples 1, 2 and 3) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol mixture 4:1 (v/v). Afterwards, the organic sol-vents were removed by evaporation under vacuum using a rotavapor (25 \u00b0C, 50 rpm; Buchi 215, Switzerland). Thus obtained dried lipid film was hydrated with aqueous phase, phosphate buffer pH 7.4, under three hydration steps: ul-trasonication (50/60 Hz), vortexing and gentle shaking. Ev-ery step lasted 5 min and four cycles of hydration were per-formed. Obtained liposomes were submitted to high shear homogenization (24 000 rpm, 5 min; Ultra-Turrax T25, Ika-Werke, Germany) and were allowed to stand for 24 h at 4 oC. For preparation of RA-E loaded liposomes (200 mg initially added) two different approaches were performed, i). RA-E was dissolved in organic solvents mixture required for lip-id phase formation (samples 1a, 2a and 3a) and ii). RA-HE was dissolved in an aqueous phase (sample 1b, 2b and 3b).From results obtained from particle size analysis and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%), sample 2a was se-lected for preparation of PEGylated liposomes (sample P2a), where PEG was incorporated into the lipid phase (SL:CH:PEG mass ratio=10:1:0.5).Liposome characterizationPrepared liposomes were characterized in terms of mean particle size (D50) and particle size distribution (SPAN fac-tor) by laser diffractometry (Mastersizer 2000, Hydro 2000S, Malvern Instr. Ltd., UK). EE% was calculated on a basis of non-encapsulated portion of RA-E by HPLC.  Analyses were performed on Merck Hitachi HPLC system (Darmstadt, Ger-many), equipped with Ellite LaChrom L-2200 autosampler, L-2130 pump and L-2450 diode array detector. The column used was Zorbax Eclipse XDB RP C-18 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, Agilent, Germany). The used mobile phase was: A - 1% formic acid (pH 3.0) and B - acetonitrile (90:10 v/v). Chromatographic conditions were set according to the method described by Cvetkovikj et al. (2013) with small modifications. Quantification of rosmarinic acid was per-formed using UV/VIS DAD at 330 nm.Results and discussionObtained blank liposomes had D50 of 134, 129 and 130 nm (sample 1, 2 and 3, respectively) with unimodal nar-row size distribution (SPAN factor 1.905, 1.743 and 1.782, respectively). By incorporation of RA-E into the aqueous phase, no significant differences in particle size of the pre-pared samples were observed and drug EE was found to quiet low (~ 17%). On the other hand, incorporation of RA-E into the lipid film resulted with increase in lipo-somes size (D50 168, 136 and 161 nm for sample 1a, 2a and 3a, respectively), the particle distribution became broad-er and EE was 39.4-54.2%. From obtained data, it is possi-ble to come to a conclusion that procedure of RA-E load-ing into liposomes seemed to have a significant effect on D50 and EE. Also, the differences in drug EE between the two different approaches could be related to the nature and physicochemical properties of the used herbal extract.Therefore, sample 2a with D50 136 nm and EE of 54.2% was selected for preparation of PEGylated liposomes. Blank PEGylated liposomes had a mean size of 141 nm (SPAN 3.845) The steric stabilization afforded by PEG incorporation into the lipid bilayer of RA-HE loaded liposomes affected the mean size of the vesicles. Namely, sample P2a had D50 of 163 nm (SPAN 2.06), which is known to be suitable for intravenous application achieving long plasma circulation time (Tanaka et al., 2004), and no significant difference in EE was observed. Further studies related to the influence of PEG quantity on the physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of liposomes should reveal the potential of designed system for efficient brain delivery of RA-E. ConclusionIn this study, RA-E loaded conventional and PEGylat-ed liposomes were successfully prepared. Considering the characteristics of the liposomes such as particle size, dis-tribution and encapsulation efficiency, the delivery system seems suitable to overcome the drawbacks and to improve brain drug therapy after parenteral application.ReferencesCvetkovikj, I., Stefkov, Gj., Acevska, J., Petreska-Stanoeva, J., Karapandzova, M., Stefova, M., Dimitrovska, A., Kulevanova, S., 2013.

Ericace-ae, also known as bearberry or bear\u2019s ear, is a small pro-cumbent woody groundcover shrub, widely distributed on a global level. The flowers are small, urn-shaped and grouped in terminal clusters that bloom in summer and the fruits are a red berries. The leaves are small, shiny and ev-ergreen, remaining green for 1-3 years before falling. The use of bearberry leaves for the first time was lit-erally documented in the middle Ages in the Welsh \u201cPhy-sicians of Nyddfai\u201d from the 13th century. From the begin-ning of 19th century, bearberry is in official use. It was used for treatment of different diseases such as hydrops, lithia-sis, in diabetes, for the therapy of gonorrhoea, etc. Now-adays only the use as urinary tract antiseptic and diuret-ic remains due to the presence of arbutin and hydroqui-none (Beaux et al., 1999; Jurica et al., 2015). Additional-ly, the herb contains tannins that have astringent effect and protect from early stage of infections (Dykes et al., 2003; Head, 2008; Pegg et al., 2008). According to Ph.Eur.8.0 (2014), commercial forms that are used consist of whole or cut, dried leaf of Arcto-staphylos uva-ursi that contains not less than 7.00% of an-hydrous arbutin (Ph.Eur.8.0., 2014). The content of arbu-tin can be determined in plant extracts by many methods including: sprectrophotometry, capillary zone electropho-resis, and HPCL method, that was found to be the most suitable for arbutin separation and is prescribed within the Ph.Eur.8.0. (Amarowizh et al., 2009; Parejo et al., 2001; Ph.Eur.8.0, 2014). In the Republic of Macedonia the natural populations of bearberry represent a unique source of leaves which are distributed in the following areas: Skopje Valley, moun-tains of Yakupitsa, Karadzitsa, Dautitsa, Shar Mountain, Osogovo Mountains and Mariovo. Bear\u2019s ear thrives on rocky ground in the light woods of black and white pine and in subalpic plant communities on limestone and dolo-mite ground. Although it is an indigenous species for this region there are no literature data for the content of the ar-butin in bearberry populations.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantify the amount of arbutin from seven different populations of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi from Korab Mountain with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).Materials and methodsPlant MaterialLeaves were collected from seven different natural populations of A. uva-ursi from seven different mountain areas of Korab, from R. Macedonia. Every area shows dif-ferent geographical characteristics. Plant identity was veri-fied and voucher specimens were deposited at the Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Skopje, Macedo-nia. Leaves were air dried, packed in paper bags, and kept in the dark and cold until analysis.Extraction: The water extracts were isolated from dried leaves from bearberry, according to the method de-scribed in the European Pharmacopeia (Ph.Eur.8.0., 2014).HPLC methodChromatographic analyses were carried out using an HPLC system from the Agilent 1200 series, apply-S8 OP 307644Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 643 - 644 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessioning the method described in the Ph.Eur.8.0 monograph (01/2008:1054), using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB RP C-18 col-umn (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, Agilent, Germany), pro-tected with a guard column (4 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, RP-18, 5 \u03bcm, Agilent, Germany). The eluents were: methanol R and wa-ter R, 10:90 (v/v). The flow rate was 1.2 mL/min and the injection volume was 20 \u03bcL. The column temperature was maintained at room temperature, and detection was carried out at 280 nm. Quantification of the samples for arbutin was per-formed immediately after extraction to avoid possible chemical alterations using a 1 mg/mL stock of arbutin stan-dard.Results and discussionThe content of arbutin expressed as % of anhydrous arbutin, was determinate by high performance liquid chro-matography from seven different populations of A. uva ursi from Macedonia and ranged from 7.41% to 10.46%. Among the analysed samples the highest content of arbutin was found in population 06 (P06) = 10.46% and the lowest was in the population 11 (P11) = 7.84%.All seven sampled indigenous populations of bearber-ry leaf had arbutin content above 7.00%, which comply with the Ph.Eur.8.0 requirements. ConclusionSeven population of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi from Ko-rab Mountain were evaluated regarding arbutin content ac-cording to the Ph.Eur.8.0 method. The content was deter-mined by high performance liquid chromatography and the results were ranged from 7.84% to 10.46%.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* ana.vavlukis@gmail.comIntroductionAntiplatelet therapy is standard treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and/or undergo-ing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Clopido-grel, an adenosine diphosphate receptor (P2Y12) block-er, has been used as a gold standard (alone orinassocia-tion with aspirin) to prevent vascular complications in ath-erothrombotic patients undergoing PCI, and as a long-term prevention of cardiovascular events (Campo et al., 2011). Clopidogrel is subject to efflux via P-glycoprotein (encod-ed by the ABCB1 gen, also known as MDR1). The clini-cal outcome of Clopidogrel may be influenced by both ge-netic and non-genetic factors. Among genetic factors, the ABCB1 polymorphisms, particularly C3435T, may be as-sociated with altered drug metabolism, efficacy and clini-cal outcome (Mega et al., 2010). The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of ABCB1 C3435T genetic poly-morphism on clinical cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease patients on Clopidogrel treatment.Materials and methodsThe study included a total of 227 subjects, of which 107 healthy volunteers (76 men and 31 women) and 120 patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease on treat-ment with Clopidogrel from the Special Hospital for Sur-gical Diseases \u201cFilip II\u201d. The genotyping of both the con-trol group and the patient group was performed with Real-Time PCR based on the allelic discrimination method using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay for C3435T (rs1045642 as-say ID C_7586657_20) according to the guidelines of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, USA). Statistical analy-sis was performed using SPSS software (v. 22). The gen-otype distributions were assessed for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) with \u03c72 test using an online calculator (http://ihg.gsf.de/cgi-bin/hw/hwa1.pl).Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence interval limits (95% CI). The level of statistical significance was defined as p \u2264 0.05.Results and discussionThe distributions of the ABCB1 allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of C1236T, G2677T/Aand C3435T genetic variations in ABCB1 gene for the Macedonian healthy population (control group) have been determined. According to our results, the frequency of the wild-type al-lele for C3435T (51%) in our study is similar to the gener-al frequency reported for Caucasians of European descen-dant, but differs from that of Asian and African population. Allelic frequencies in exon 26 were 51.4% for C allele and 48.6% for mutant T allele, whereas the observed genotype frequencies were 25.2% for 3435CC, 52.3% for 3435CT and 22.5% for 3435TT (Naumovska et al., 2014). The de-termination of distribution of the ABCB1 allele, genotype and haplotype frequency of the C3435T genetic variation in ABCB1 gene in the patient group is in progress.In recent years, there are vast numbers of published data that report on evidence for the influence of SNPs in the ABCB1 gene on P-gp function. These polymorphic S8 OP 308646Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 645 - 646 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessionvariants are potential determinants of inter-individual vari-ability in drug response and potential for a negative clinical outcome. A meta-analysis of twelve studies (four involved platelet activity and ten involved clinical outcomes) indi-cated that the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism might be a risk factor for early major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients on clopidogrel, and that TT homozy-gotes decreased the outcome of bleeding compared with CC homozygotes. The four platelet activity studies result-ed in an association between high platelet activity and the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism that was not statistically significant. The long-term MACE had no significant asso-ciation with ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism. Three studies demonstrated that significant elevated risk of early MACE was associated with T allele, TT homozygote and CT + TT dominant genetic model. The ABCB1 C3435T polymor-phism was unrelated to the rate of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Seven cohort stud-ies reported that stent thrombosis was not associated with ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism in all genotype models. The comparison of TT vs. CC was associated with a sig-nificant reduction in the outcome of bleeding in five cohort studies (Su et al., 2012). Another meta-analysis of six stud-ies with 10.153 subjects failed to show an association be-tween the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism and the risk of long-term adverse clinical events in clopidogrel treated pa-tients. The association of the C3435T polymorphism with risk of overall recurrent ischemic events and stent throm-bosis in clopidogrel treated patients was not statistically significant for all genetic models. However, a significant association was identified between the TT homozygotes and risk of short-term recurrent ischemic events (Luo et al., 2012).Another study found no association of ABCB1 C3435T genotype with clopidogrel response or risk of stent thrombosis in patients undergoing coronary stenting. DNA samples from 1524 clopidogrel-treated patients un-dergoing PCI were genotyped, ADP \u2013 induced platelet ag-gregation was assessed and the clinical impact of the ge-netic variant was investigated by comparison of genotype frequencies in a registry of 66 cases with definite drug \u2013 eluting stent thrombosis versus an ST-free control cohort (n = 1408). The aggregation did not differ across geno-type groups, and platelet aggregation values were simi-lar and numerically lower in homozygous T-allele carri-ers compared to the remaining patients. The genotype dis-tribution did not differ between case subjects and control subjects. Among the 66 ST case subjects, 19 were carri-ers of the ABCB1 3435TT genotype, which was not sig-nificantly different from the rate of TT carriers in the con-trol group (Jaitner et al., 2012). In contrast to the previ-ous, the Genetic Variants in ABCB1, CYP2C19 and Car-diovascular Outcomes Following Treatment with Clopido-grel and Prasugrel study showed that the C3435T genotype was significantly associated with risk of adverse cardio-vascular events. 2932 patients with an acute coronary syn-drome (ACS) in the TRITON-TIMI 38 treated with clopi-dogrel were genotyped. Among the ACS patients, ABCB1 C3435T genotype was significantly associated with risk of the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke. TT homozygotes showed a 72% increased risk of the pri-mary endpoint as compared with CT/CC individuals when evaluated through 15 months. The rates of stent thrombo-sis did not differ between the TT homozygotes and CT/CC patients (Mega et al., 2010).ConclusionABCB1 C3435T SNP has been associated with an in-creased P-glycoprotein expression, which theoretically should lead to decreased absorption, lower platelet inhi-bition and an increased rate of ischemic event occurrence in patients treated with clopidogrel. However, controver-sy exists regarding whether the C3435T variant influenc-es clopidogrel associated clinical outcomes. The ongoing ABCB1 C3435T genotyping study of patients with coro-nary artery disease is expected to determine the influence of this variant on clopidogrel associated clinical outcome in R.

Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* slavkovski.andrej@gmail.comIntroductionAtorvastatin (ATS) is an important and efficacious member of the statins drug class in treating dyslipidemia and coronary heart disease. It works by inhibiting 3-hy-droxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reduc-tase that reduces hepatocyte cholesterol levels which in turn causes up-regulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and increased clearance of LDL-cholesterol from the plasma. ATS is a poorly water-soluble BCS class II drug, which is highly lipophilic (partition coefficient [log P (octanol/water)] of 6.36) in nature (Oliveira et al., 2013). Its low oral bioavailability (~12%) is attributed to its poor aqueous solubility, pre-systemic metabolism in GI mucosa and efflux by P-gp (Khan et al., 2016). To overcome these problems, various solubilization strategies have been proposed in the literature (Ali et al., 2013). One such more successful technique is formulation of spontaneous or self-emulsifying drug delivery system. Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems have been catego-rized as, self-microemulsifying (SMEDDS) and self-nano-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) depending upon the droplet size produced after dispersion. The SMEDDS are preconcentrates of microemulsion, which form a microemulsion upon contacting water. These are anhydrous homogeneous mixtures of oil, surfactant and/or cosurfactant, and drug which when come in contact with aqueous medium (GI fluids) form a o/w (oil-in-wa-ter) microemulsion with little agitation (provided by peri-staltic movement of GIT). This spontaneous formation of a fine emulsion in the GIT presents the drug in a solubilized form, and the small droplet size provides a large interfa-cial surface area for drug absorption (Kishore et al., 2015).In light of above said facts, the aim of the present study was to establish the solubility of ATS in aqueous systems using self-microemulsification technique. ATS containing SMEDDS were developed using olive oil as oil phase, PEG 400 as surfactant and Tween 20 as co-surfactant screened from the solubility studies. Mixture simplex lattice design was applied for determination of the optimal formulation where mean droplet size, size distribution and optical clar-ity were followed as responses. Materials and methodsMaterialsOlive oil was supplied from Fluka Analytical, Spain. Tween 20 (polysorbate 20) was purchased from Merck, Germany. PEG 400 (polyethylene glycol 400) was ob-tained from Merck, Germany. Atorvastatin calcium (ATS; Form VII, D50 1.4 \u00b5m) was kindly donated by Alkaloid, Macedonia. All the other chemicals and reagents were of the highest purity grade commercially available and used as received. Solubility studiesThe solubility determination of ATS in various liquid lipids (olive oil, mineral oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, oleic acid, castor oil), surfactants (Tween 20, Tween 60, Tween 80, Span 20, Span 80) and co-surfactants (PEG 200, PEG 400, propylene glycol, ethanol, isopropanol) was per-formed by the test tube method. Excess ATS (250 mg) was added into 1 g of each vehicle followed by vortex mixing for 30 s. Mixtures were equilibrated for 72 h at 37 \u00b0C on a controlled shaker water bath (Haake SWB 20, Germa-ny). Afterwards, mixtures were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 45 min; Tehtnica, Centric 322B, Slovenia). Solubility of ATS in different vehicles was determined visually. Only sam-648Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 647 - 648 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessionples where ATS was completely dissolved were used for preparation of SMEDDS. The experiments were conduct-ed in triplicate.Preparation of SMEDDSBased on the results obtained from solubility stud-ies, olive oil, Tween 20 and PEG 400 were selected for preparation of ATS-SMEDDS (ATS 20 mg). Mixture sim-plex lattice design (Design-Expert V8 trial, Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, USA) was applied for determination of their optimal quantities. Mixture components in total of 100% (Smix = 0.5 g) were varied. Low and high levels of studied variables were: variable A, olive oil - 10 and 50%; variable B, Tween 20 \u2013 10 and 50% and variable C, PEG 400 - 40 and 80%. A total of 13 experiments were carried out. Mean droplet size, size distribution and optical clarity were fol-lowed as responses. Optimization was carried out in terms of minimal values of followed responses. In brief, designed Smix`s with ATS were prepared in test tubes and stirred for 24 h (200 rpm, 37 \u00b0C; Variomag, USA). Afterwards, the prepared mixtures were added into 300 mL of 0.1 M HCl in a glass beakers maintained at 37 \u00b0C and stirred at 300 rpm until a transparent solution was formed.Characterization of SMEDDSMean droplet size (D50) and size distribution (ex-pressed as SPAN factor value) of the obtained SMEDDS were assessed by laser diffractometry using Mastersizer 2000, Hydro 2000S, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK.Samples of freshly prepared SMEDD formulations were investigated for optical clarity spectrophotometri-cally (400 nm; UV/vis spectrophotometer, Perkin Elmer, Lambda 16, USA). The lower absorbance indicated higher optical clarity of the systems. The ATS content present in prepared formulations was assessed by dissolving 1ml of the liquid SMEDD formu-lation in methanol. After suitable dilutions with methanol, drug content was assayed at 246 nm (UV/vis spectropho-tometer, Perkin Elmer, Lambda 16, USA).Results and discussionSolubility studies were carried out in order to identify the suitable vehicles for the formulation of SMEDDS. Ol-ive oil, Tween 20 and PEG 400 were selected as oil phase, surfactant and co-surfactant based on their highest solubil-ity towards ATS.Results from experimental design studies pointed that D50 was in range of 0.61 \u00b5m to 1.212 \u00b5m and SPAN factor from 1.072 to 2.958, with unimodal particle size distribu-tion.  The absorbance related to optical clarity of the pre-pared formulations was in range of 0.119 to 0.455.A special cubic model for D50 and reduced cubic mod-el for SPAN factor and optical clarity was applied. Math-ematical models for influence of selected variables upon followed responses were created and significant variables were identified. Variables BC, AC, AB and ABC were sig-nificant for D50. For SPAN factor value and optical clarity, variables BC, AC, AB and AC*(A-C) and BC*(B-C) and AC*(A-C) were significant factors, respectively.Results from experimental design studies were used for determination of optimal formulation; sample prepared with 15.44% olive oil, 19.48% Tween 20 and 65.08% PEG 400 with predicted responses of 0.78 for D50, 1.14 for SPAN factor and 0.18 for absorbance with the desirabili-ty value of 0.831. Cross validation of the model was car-ried out and satisfactory results for percent of relative er-ror (less than 10%) of the predicted and experimental val-ues were obtained.The ATS content in prepared SMEDDS was found to be in the range of 94\u201399%. The data inferred good drug-loading with low standard deviation indicating the unifor-mity of drug content. Optimized liquid formulation of ATS was further spray-dried in order to obtain solid SMEDDS.ConclusionLiquid SMEDDS of ATS were composed according to the solubility of drug in mixtures of oil phase, surfactant and co-surfactant systems. Optimal formulation was se-lected based on results from the experimental design stud-ies. Further investigations will be focused on characteriza-tion of solid SMEDDS in order to confirm the potential of the designed system for solving the problem of formulat-ing drugs with low aqueous solubility and poor systemic bioavailability.

Cyril & Methodius\u201d University,Majka Teresa 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* stanojkovskaradmila@yahoo.comIntroductionMultiple emulsions are complex polydispersed sys-tems where both oil in water (o/w) and water in oil (w/o) emulsion exists simultaneously in a single system, stabi-lized by lipophillic and hydrophilic surfactants, respective-ly. The ratio of these surfactants is critical factor for achiev-ing stable vesicular system (Kumar et al., 2012).  Multiple emulsions have been formulated for controlled/sustained or targeted drug delivery, taste masking, enzyme immobili-zation, as well as cosmetic vehicles for skin care products. Water/oil/water (w/o/w) multiple emulsions consist of dispersed oil globules containing smaller aqueous droplets; each inner aqueous droplet is separated from the outer aque-ous phase by an oil phase layer which acts as a liquid mem-brane. Therefore,  w/o/w multiple emulsions have many advantages over conventional emulsions such as: relative-ly high entrapment capacity for water-soluble agents, pro-tection of substances that may undergo degradation, abil-ity to introduce incompatible substances in two aqueous compartments of the same system and prolonged release rate of incorporated active agent (Mahmood and Akhtar, 2013). The release properties and stability of w/o/w mul-tiple emulsions are influenced by different factors, such as surfactants type and concentration, method of preparation, and some physical properties of the designed vesicular sys-tem (globule size, viscosity, conductivity, phase volume ra-tio, etc) (Vasiljevic et al., 2009).In our preliminary studies, different factors (surfac-tants concentration, phase volume ratio, preparation pro-cedure) were investigated, and optimized formulation and process parameters were selected for further development of w/o/w multiple emulsion system suitable for topical de-livery of resveratrol (RSV). RSV, an antioxidant polyphe-nol from red wine, has been the subject of intense interest in recent years due to a range of unique anti-aging proper-ties (Baxter, 2008). Therefore, the purposes of this research were to develop w/o/w multiple emulsion formulation us-ing Brij\u00ae 93 and Tween\u00ae 20 as surfactants with resvera-trol as active agent and to evaluate the characteristic prop-erties and stability of the designed system. Materials and methodsMaterialsResveratrol (RSV) 2% aqueous solution was kindly donated from ACTIChem., France. Polyoxyethilene oleyl ether (Brij\u00ae 93) and polyoxyethilene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween\u00ae 20) were obtained from ICI, USA. Liquid par-affin was supplied from Merck KGaA, Germany. All oth-er chemicals and reagent were of analytical grade and used as received.Preparation of multiple emulsionsMultiple emulsions were prepared by a two-step emul-sification process. Briefly, for primary emulsification, 3 g of aqueous phase and 1 g of oil phase (liquid paraffin and Brij 93, mass ratio = 1:0.25) were preheated at 38 \u00b0C. Af-terwards, the aqueous phase was gradually added to the oil phase using high-shear rotor-stator homogenizer (2.5 min, 9500 rpm; Ultra-Turrax\u00ae T25, Ika-Werke, Germany). Homogenization was continued for additional 7.5 min. For secondary emulsification, prepared w/o emulsion was emulsified with 6 g of external aqueous phase containing 1% of Tween 20 under the same conditions. Three differ-ent formulations of RSV loaded (1.5%) w/o/w emulsions were prepared (sample 1 - RSV was incorporated into the inner aqueous phase (100%), sample 2 \u2013 75% of RSV was S8 PP 310650Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 649 - 650 (2016)Poster presentationsStudent sessionincorporated into the inner vs. 25% in outer aqueous phase) and sample 3 \u2013 RSV was equally divided into two aqueous compartments (50:50%)).  Blank sample was prepared for comparison.Characterization of multiple emulsions with resveratrolMicroscopic analysis was conducted in order to gain information about the multiple structure of the prepared emulsions.  An optical microscope (OPTIKA\u00ae B-352A, OPTIKA SRL, Italy) with camera (AIPTEK\u2122 1080p HD, Aiptek International GmbH, Germany) was used through-out the study. The droplet size was measured using Mas-tersizer 2000 (Malvern instruments, UK) equipped with Hydro 2000S, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK. In vitro RSV release studies were carried out using simple dissolution cells with semipermeable membrane (Visking tube from regenerated cellulose, thickness 0.9 nm, pores size 1.52-2 nm; Serva Feinbiochemica GmbH, Germany). Briefly, 2 g of each formulation was added to donor compartment and membrane was tied on the bottom end of the tube. The tube was dipped into vessel contain-ing 40 ml of water and was stirred at 100 rpm on a mag-netic stirrer and maintained at 32 \u00b0C. Aliquots of 5 ml were collected from receiving chamber at predetermined time intervals and the RSV content was determined UV spec-tophotometrically (UV/VIS Spectrophotometer, Perkin El-mer Lambda 16, USA) at 324 nm.Stability studiesThe emulsions were monitored for consistency, color, homogeneity, phase separation and particle size during the storage period of three months at 5 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C. Conductometric analysis was performed after the preparation of the sam-ples and after three months stability period. Conductivity of the emulsions was measured directly using conductivi-ty meter SevenCompact\u2122 Conductivity S230 (METTLER TOLEDO, Switzerland) at 25 \u00b0C \u00b1 2 \u00b0C.Results and discussionImmediately after preparation, the w/o/w emulsions were apparently brownish and homogenous viscous liq-uids. The samples do not show any changes in appearance and homogeneity during the first 2 months of stability stud-ied period. However, physical destabilization/flocculation was observed at the end of third month.Microscopic analysis revealed the multiple character of the prepared samples with droplets containing a large number of small internal droplets (type A multiple emul-sions) (Okushima et al., 2004). Blank sample had a mean size of 1.82 \u00b5m and SPAN factor of 1.45, with unimodal narrow size distribution. Mean droplet size of RSV load-ed emulsions was 2.35, 1.76 and 2.38 \u00b5m and SPAN fac-tor 1.45, 1.77 and 1.37 for samples 1, 2 and 3, respective-ly. No significant differences in particle size were observed during the first two months of stability studied period. Af-ter three months, mean droplet size was 0.21, 0.69 and 0.46 \u00b5m for sample 1, 2 and 3, respectively, with bimodal par-ticle size distribution indicating physical destabilization of the prepared systems probably due to the osmotic flow of water from internal to the external phase thus leading to shrinkage of the internal water droplets. Electrical conduc-tivity of the freshly prepared samples was 48.8 \u2013 54.2 \u00b5S/cm. At the end of stability studied period only slight in-crease in the conductivity values was observed most like-ly due to coalescence of the internal and aqueous phases (Mahmood and Akhtar, 2013), but however no significant differences in conductivity were determined. RSV release from the prepared samples was 50.13, 51.86 and 85.42% during the investigated period of 24 h for samples 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The rate of RSV re-lease followed non-zero order kinetics (R > 0.997) with the release exponent ranging between 0.1 and 0.5.ConclusionResveratrol (1.5%) loaded w/o/w multiple emulsions containing low concentration of surfactants were prepared and characterized with respect to their size, release prop-erties and stability. Obtained results suggested that formu-lation prepared with equally divided amount of resvera-trol into the two aqueous compartments could be explored as a skin rejuvenating candidate. Further studies will be focused on formulation modification in order to achieve long-term stability.ReferencesBaxter, A.R., 2008.

Macedonia* spase.151134@student.ugd.edu.mkIntroductionProbiotics are defined as live microorganisms that have positive health effects on the host. There are many strains of probiotics that can confer health benefits, but the most prominent species are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacte-rium. Numerous evidences indicate that selected probiotic strains can provide health benefits to the human host. Up to date, many clinical trials investigated the medical effects of these bacteria, particularly the positive effects to the gas-trointestinal (GI) system. Moreover, studies have shown that probiotics exert beneficial effects to the immune sys-tem, the urogenital system, in diabetes, oral health etc. (Charalampopoulos and Rastall, 2009).The immune system, being highly adaptable defense system, functions in preserving the integrity of the organ-ism by eliminating all elements perceived as foreign. Sev-eral in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that specific strains of probiotics are able to modulate the functioning of the immune system, stimulate the immune function to pro-tect against infectious diseases and different types of can-cer and regulate over expressed immune responses asso-ciated with immune inflammatory disorders such as aller-gy (Gill and Guarner, 2004). In addition, studies presented beneficial effects in atopic diseases, including atopic ecze-ma, allergic rhinitis and asthma.The purpose of this review was to explore among the reported effects of different probiotic strains to the immune system, specifically in allergy.Effects of probiotics in asthma and rhinitisIn one of the study with 41 asthmatic children (age 6-12 years) a decrease of the inflammatory cytokine, TNF-\u03b1 and Th2 cytokine IL-10 and IL-13 was shown. Pe-ripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from the patients assigned to the probiotic-treated groups prior to and following the treatment and were then incubat-ed with phytohemagglutinin, Dermatophagoides pteron-yssinus, supplemented with Lactobacillus gasseri for 72h. Production of the cytokines in the culture supernatants was assayed using enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELI-SA). The results of the study showed that the patients who took L. gasseri capsules for 8 weeks showed significant de-crease in the cytokine level compared to the control group (Chen, et al., 2010).Another study examined the effect of Lactobacillus casei in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis. A group of 187 asthmatic children between the age 2 and 5 years were tested for period of 12 months. This study pre-sented that the milk, fermented with Lactobacillus casei didn\u2019t show significant difference in the health status of asthmatic children compared to the control group. How-ever, consumption of Lactobacillus casei fermented milk resulted in improvement in children with allergic rhinitis, i.e the number of rhinitis episodes was lower in the chil-dren treated with probiotics compared to the control group (Giovannini et al., 2007).Effects of probiotics in allergy animal modelsAnimal studies concerning effects of probiotics in al-lergy also emerge, presenting a deeper understanding of the effects of probiotics. For example, one study exam-ined the potential of 28 strains of probiotics in prophylax-is of peanut-induced allergy in mouse model. Groups of 8 mice were orally exposed to PBS (control) or peanut ex-tract (PE) plus cholera toxin (CT). Oral exposure was per-formed on days 0, 1, 2, 10, 17 and 24.  After a 6-week pro-S8 PP 311652Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 651 - 652 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsbiotic treatment with each strain and a 4-week oral expo-sure regimen to PBS or PE with CT, the IgE specific for PE was measured. The results showed that Lactobacillus plan-tarum increases the IgE in the serum, but Lactobacillus sal-ivarius decreases the IgE for PE. In addition Lactobacillus casei Shirota didn\u2019t show any effect to the IgE for PE, but the measured IL-4 and IL-5 levels were lowered by just us-ing these strains. Again, L. plantarum increases the IL-4 level but didn\u2019t show any effect on IL-5 and L. salivari-us showed slightly decreased level of the both cytokines (Meijerink et al., 2012).Another study in mouse model of asthma studied the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, using clinical evalua-tions in vivo, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis, serum IgG analysis, cytokine and lymphocyte proliferation as-says.  The mice were sensitized by intra peritoneal admin-istration of 10 \u00b5g ovalbumin with alum mixture. Treg cells, isolated from the spleen were analyzed for CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ expression using flow citometry. This study pre-sented that Lactobacillus rhamnosus treatment led to a sig-nificant increase in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells, com-pared to the percentage in positive control mice, suggest-ing that Lactobacillus rhamnosus induced attenuation of allergic responses in the mouse model of asthma is associ-ated with an increased CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cell popu-lation (Jang et al., 2012).ConclusionMany studies are trying to unveil the mechanisms of probiotic involvement and their beneficial effects to the health. Animal studies and clinical trials in different popu-lations regarding different medical conditions, present ef-fects that are somewhat controversial. In this context, as our literature research resulted, many of the evidences re-garding immunological (allergic) diseases present weak or minimal effects.ReferencesCharalampopoulos, D., Rastall, R.A.

Sialic monomers possess the ability to bond with one an-other and form dimers, oligomers and polysialic acids. In particular, polysialic acids are found to be involved in neu-ral adhesion, more precisely, they regulate the activity of the molecules that control neural adhesion. The group of sialic acids contains about 50 derivates of N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-glycolylneuraminic acid and deaminoneuraminic acid. Methylation, sulfation, acet-ylation and interactions between monomers of these three substances form the large group of sialic acids. Polysialic acids are mainly involved in changes of many functions of the nervous system. Neural cell adhe-sion molecule is the most studied polysialated protein in which the polysialic acid contains \u03b12-8 bonded N-acetyl-neuraminic acid. This protein is connected to the cell mem-brane with glycosyl phosphatidylinositol or it can be pres-ent as a transmembrane protein involved in cell signaliza-tion. Polysialic acids are present in the adult brain in the hypocampus, thalamus, amygdale, subventricular zone and prefrontal cortex, to be precise, in the parts where neu-ral plasticity, neural generation and remodeling of neural connections are ongoing. It is more abundant in embryon-ic brain tissue. The processes that polysialic acids are involved in-clude neural cell migration, axonal guidance, myelina-tion, fasciculation and plasticity of the nervous system. The mechanism of these actions is the anti-adhesive effect of polysialic acids in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The anti-adhesive effect on is a results of the polyanion-ic nature of these molecules, that generate a large negative electric field (Sato and Kijatima, 2013). Clinical implicationSchizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder with multiple factors contributing to its pathogenesis. Some reports sug-gest that polysialic acids are involved in schizophrenia and other related psychiatric disorders. The background of this thesis lays in the gene that codes for an enzyme called al-pha-2,8-sialyltransferase. Biochemical analysis suggests that the activity of this gene is decreased in schizophrenic patients, thus resulting with impairment of the quality and quantity of polysialic acids in the brain (Sato and Kijatima, 2013). The level of sialylation of the neural cell adhesion molecule is decreased as well. Many cancer cells express polysialic acids on their cell surfaces. This results in attack to these cells by many mol-ecules including anti-sialic antibodies (Sato and Kijatima, 2013). Furthermore, because of its anti-adhesive effect, polysialic acids stimulate metastasis of the disease. Mono/di/oligosialic acids are considered as parts of other pathological changes in the human organism. Many bacterial toxins such as toxins from cholera, tetanus and pertussis, as well as various virus types bind to sialylated glycoconjugates. An example of this is the binding of influ-enza virus with sialic acid containing glycans. The mecha-nism of action is based on the activity of influenza\u2019s most important glycoproteins: hemagglutinine and neuramini-dase. Both glycoproteins recognize and bind to the the si-alylated glycans of the cell membrane. First, the virus rep-lication occurs, and then the activity of neuraminidase be-gins stimulating dissociation of the sialic acids from the S8 PP 312654Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 653 - 654 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsglycan and subsequent increased permeability of  the cell membrane for the virus (Gamblin and Skehel, 2010). Sialic acids are also found to be involved in nonalcho-holic fatty liver diease (Zhenya et al., 2016). The concen-tration of the sialic acids in the serum increases when non-alcoholic fatty liver disease occurs in non obese patients. Three possible mechanisms might underline the associa-tion between sialic acids and the disease. Firstly, nonalco-holic fatty liver disease patients are insulin resistant. The mechanisms that cause insulin resistance also causes ele-vated sialation of the glycolipides and glycoproteins in the human serum and secondly, the reason for a higher concen-tration of sialic acids in the serum of these patients can be the oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is an inevitable part of this disease, damaging the liver, and producing reactive oxygen species that interact with the terminal nonreducing parts of the serum glycoconjugates. This results with dis-sociation of the sialic acids in the human serum. Finally, si-alic acids can be part of proteins produced by the liver as a response to the disease, called acute phase proteins. Sialic acids are involved in other inflammatory processes such as cardiovascular diseases. Sialic acids are bioindicators of diabetes mellitus. Their presence is greater in type 2 diabetes patients suf-fering from diabetic nephropathy. Some of the sialylated glycoproteins in the human serum are called acute phase reactants, because their concentration increases during in-flammation. In type two diabetes mellitus, there is a stage of cytokine induced-acute phase response which leads to elevated sialic acid concentration in the serum. In diabet-ic nephropathy, there is damage to the vascular endotheli-al cells of the kidney, which is accompanied with inflam-mation, resulting with elevated concentration of sialic ac-ids in the serum. It is important to note that the concentra-tion of these substances is greater when diabetic nephropa-thy occurs, in comparison to cases with uncomplicated di-abetes (Varma et al., 2016). ConclusionSialic acids play a great roll in the ethiopathology and the diagnosing of many pathological changes in the hu-man organism. They are considered one of the indicators in diagnosing diabetic nephropathy in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus. Elevated levels of sialic ac-ids in the human serum are associated with non obese fat-ty liver disease and indicate a potential risk for its develop-ment. This means that sialic acids play a role in the meta-bolic changes that result with this disease, and as such are used in its diagnosis. In infections on the other hand, sial-ic acids are used indirectly in therapy. Identification of the mechanisms of binding of the viruses to the cells, enables creation of antiviral medications for treatment of many in-fections caused by resistant viruses and bacteria. Various types of cancer show elevated concentration of polysialic acids, making the diagnosis of the disease easier. Finally, in vivo and in vitro analyses show that enzymatic activity of alpha 2,8-sialyltransferase is decreased in patients with schizophrenia, resulting with impairment of the quality and quantity of the polisyalic acids.ReferencesGamblin, S.J., Skehel, J.J., 2010.

Those medicinal products are larger and more complex than conventional (non-biological) drugs. Biolog-icals can be hormones (growth hormones, insulin, erythro-poietin), enzymes, monoclonal antibodies, blood products, immunological medicinal products (sera and vaccines) or advanced technology products such as gene and cell ther-apy (Consensus Information Paper, 2013). The structure\u2013function relationships of biologicals are very sensitive, be-cause modifications of tertiary or quaternary configuration may affect safety, purity and potency. They have a complex mechanism of action by targeting more selective to the cell or molecule that is responsible for the development of cer-tain diseases.The paradigm for biologicals \u201cthe process is the prod-uct\u201d still is viable today.  Their manufacturing is challeng-ing process, where critical culturing and purification steps is required to produce a consistent, high quality active in-gredient. Gene manipulation, fermentation and purification are used with high level of expertise in order to guaran-tee the safety and efficacy of the final product. Biologicals are usually more difficult to characterize than chemical-ly derived medicinal products. Moreover, post-translation-al modifications such as glycosylation, oxidation and de-amination can be significantly altered by changes (Geigert, 2013). Even minor changes in manufacturing process can cause significant changes in efficacy or immunogenicity.The use of modern technologies like biotechnology, DNA recombinant techniques etc. results with the first re-combinant biological medicine, human insulin (Humulin), approved for therapeutic use in 1982 from FDA. The era of recombinant monoclonal antibodies started in 1995.  Since then, the number of biologicals approved for human use, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), has increased considerably.These medicines have advanced the treatment of many chronic and life-threatening diseases. Even though bio-logicals are much more expensive than chemical entities, health care providers and payers considered that they are worth their cost - as long as the appropriate patients re-ceive them and achieve the desired clinical outcomes. Pa-tients for whom biologicals are a good choice include those who have failed on conventional therapies or for whom no other options exist. The predictions are that by 2017 glob-al biological pharmaceutical market will amounts to about $220 billion (Dolinar and Reilly, 2013). On the other hand, after the first biological medicines were launched, exclusivity rights on these drugs have be-gun to expire, and thus present an opportunity for pharma-ceutical companies to consider developing biosimilar med-icines of these products. In general, this means that the bi-ological reference medicine must have been authorized for at least 10 years before a biosimilar can be made available by another company.What are biosimilars?Biosimilars are not generic versions of biologics. \u201cA biosimilar is a biological medicinal product that contains a version of the active substance of an already authorized original biological medicinal product (called reference medicinal product). Similarity to the reference medicinal product in terms of quality characteristics, biological ac-tivity, safety and efficacy based on a comprehensive com-parability exercise needs to be established.\u201d This includes physicochemical and biological characterization and re-quires knowledge on how to interpret   any differences be-S8 PP 313656Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 655 - 656 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationstween a biosimilar and its reference medicinal product (Eu-ropean Medicines Agency, 2014). Actually, the changing outlook for biosimilars comes at a time when the global pharmaceutical market is feeling the combined impact of two key events: a period of unprecedented patent expira-tions on many of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical prod-ucts, and a financial crisis that has required healthcare sys-tems to make significant and sustained cost reductions. Bi-osimilars may have the potential to increase patient ac-cess to potentially valuable therapies at a lower cost (IMS Health, 2011). Approval and licensing pathways of biosimilars  In 2005, the EMA/ European Commission were the first to implement a well documented legal and regulato-ry pathway for the approval of biosimilar products that is distinct from the generic pathway. The approval of the first biosimilar product, somatropin (Omnitrope), following the EMA\u2019s new approach, was in 2006, followed by erythro-poietin (2007) and filgrastim (2008). Five years later, in 2013 the first mAb biosimilar, infliximab, was approved in Europe. Market authorization for biosimilars is issued on \u201cstep by step, case by case\u201d basis to demonstrate similarity with respect to structural and functional characterization, in vitro biological assays and pharmacokinetic and phar-macodynamics evaluation, as well as safety, efficacy and immunogenicity studies. Substitution and interchangeabilitySubstitution of generic drugs for reference drugs is un-controversial because the two will be identical if they have demonstrated bioequivalence. Since biological drugs can never be exact copies, the question whether they can be substitutes of original biologics remains unclear (Ebbers and Chamberlain, 2014). These medicinal products are not directly interchangeable. In EU these terms, interchange-ability and substitution, are not used as synonyms. (Espin et al., 2011). Interchangeability refers to the prescription of biosimilar in place of the reference product by prescrib-ers, while substitution means that pharmacists are allowed to dispense a biosimilar. EMA does not guarantee inter-changeability and established that these aspects are beyond its competence. The decisions on the interchangeability of biosimilars and innovator products rest with the Mem-ber States in the EU. The European Generic Association (EGA) reported that more than 12 countries across the EU have introduced rules to avert automatic substitution of in-novator biological with biosimilars. The increased use of this medicine have arisen many questions and there remains an need to continued guidance for substitution from regulatory agencies with regards to safety issues, as well as those for pharmacovigilance and risk- mitigation activities. This is anticipated and will be critical to the further therapeutic use of biosimilars.  ReferencesConsensus Information Paper, 2013. What you need to know about Biosimilar Medicinal Products.

Cyril and Methodius\u201d University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* elisaveta.durolojkova@hotmail.comIntroductionThe aflatoxins are toxic substances produced as sec-ondary metabolites by the fungus Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Foods in which aflatoxins are commonly found include rice, corn, peanuts, tree nuts, co-coa beans. The aflatoxins are potent toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic and immunosuppressive agents. Today, there are approximately 16 known types of aflatoxins including: aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin B2, aflatoxin B3, aflatoxin G1, af-latoxin G2, aflatoxin G2a, aflatoxin M1, aflatoxin M2, af-latoxin P and aflatoxin T2. The four major aflatoxins that cause illness in humans and can be found in food are: afla-toxin B1, aflatoxin B2, aflatoxin G1 and aflatoxin G2. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified aflatoxin B1 as a group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to hu-mans) and aflatoxin M1 as a group 2b carcinogen (carcino-genic to laboratory animals and possibly carcinogenic to humans, respectively). The exposure to aflatoxins and the resulting aflatoxicosis can vary from acute to chronic, and the illness can range from mild to severe. Acute exposure to high doses of aflatoxins can result in aflatoxicosis, hav-ing the liver as a target organ, which can lead to serious liv-er damage. Chronic exposure to sublethal doses of aflatox-ins can result in liver cancer, impaired protein formation, impaired blood coagulation and toxic hepatitis.People who have aflatoxicosis might exhibit the fol-lowing characteristics:- Liver damage may be confirmed by jaundice and characteristic yellowing of tissues- Gall bladder may become swollen- Immunosuppression may provide an opportunity for secondary infections- Vitamin K functions may decrease- High level of aflatoxin B1 \u2013 albumin adducts may be present in plasma. Clinical implicationThe most commonly used human samples for aflatox-in analysis are blood and urine. Aflatoxin exposure can be monitored by using biomarkers that detect the presence of aflatoxin metabolites, excreted DNA adducts and blood protein adducts. Aflatoxin - albumin adducts are found in peripheral blood after exposure to aflatoxin B1. Aflatoxin M1 and aflatoxin B1 \u2013 DNA adduct (aflatoxin B1 \u2013 gua-nine adduct) can be detected in the urine of people consum-ing sufficient amounts of aflatoxin B1. Increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase are a biochemical indicator for aflatoxins toxicity. Detection methods for aflatoxins in human body sam-ples are radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme \u2013 linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA), high \u2013 performance liquid chro-matographic fluorescence detection (HPLCf).  Albumin samples are digested with proteinase K in a phosphate - buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 15 h at 37oC. Following hydrolysis, bovine serum albumin (BSA) is added to improve precipitation, followed by cold etha-nol addition. Samples are kept at -20oC for 2 h, centrifuged at 1500xg for 15 min and the supernatant is diluted with 6% ethanol in PBS. The samples are then loaded into an activated Sep \u2013 pak CIS cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), washed with water, 5% methanol, and the aflatoxins are eluted with 80% methanol. Eluates are dried, reconstituted in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum (to saturate residu-al proteinase K activity), and tested with ELISA using afla-toxin \u2013 lysine standard (Wild et al., 1990). A study conducted in sub \u2013 Saharan Africa proved that chronic hepatomegaly is common among school \u2013 age children in sub \u2013 Saharan Africa. This study examined the S8 PP 314658Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 657 - 658 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsrole of aflatoxin in chronic hepatomegaly. Plasma sam-ples were collected in 2002 and 2004 from 218 children attending two schools in neighboring villages (Mantagini and Yumbuni). Plasma samples were assayed for aflatoxin exposure using the aflatoxin \u2013 albumin adduct biomarker (AF \u2013 alb). The blood AF \u2013 alb levels were determined us-ing ELISA. One negative and three positive controls were analyzed alongside each batch of samples. The limit de-tection for AF \u2013 alb was 3 pg/mg albumin. AF \u2013 alb levels were high in children from both schools, but the geometric mean value (95 % confidence interval) in 2002 was signif-icantly higher in Matangini (206.5 pg/mg albumin) than in Yumbuni (73.2 pg/mg). AF \u2013 alb levels were also higher in children with firm hepatomegaly (176.6 pg/mg) compared to the control group (79.9 pg/mg). In 2004, AF \u2013 alb lev-els were higher than in 2002 (539.7 vs. 114.5pg/mg), but with no significant difference between the villages or be-tween hepatomegaly and control groups (539.7 vs. 512.6 pg/mg). Exposure to aflatoxin was associated with child-hood chronic hepatomegaly in 2002 (Gong et al., 2012).Aflatoxin is known to cross the placental barrier and exposures in utero could influence genomic programming, fetal growth and development. In a study, pregnant Gam-bian women were examined for aflatoxin exposure at two stages of their pregnancy (early - < 16 weeks; and later - 16 weeks onward), during the rainy (June to October 2009) or dry (November to May 2010) season, using aflatoxin albumin adducts (AF \u2013 alb). Plasma samples were ana-lyzed for AF \u2013 alb using a competitive ELISA. One neg-ative and three positive controls were analyzed alongside each batch of samples. The limit of detection for AF \u2013alb was 0.6 pg/mg albumin. Mean AF \u2013 alb was higher dur-ing the dry season than in the rainy season, in both early and later pregnancy, although the difference was strongest in later pregnancy. There was a modest increase in AF \u2013 alb in later compared to early pregnancy (geometric mean 41.8 vs. 34.5 pg/mg), but this was restricted to the dry sea-son when exposures were generally higher. The study con-firmed that Gambian pregnant women were exposed to af-latoxin throughout the pregnancy, with higher levels in the dry season. Overall, the stage of pregnancy was not signif-icantly associated with AF-alb but season was (Castelino et al., 2014).PreventionConsidering the danger of human contamination with aflatoxins, prevention is an imperative, as the safest and most economical protection method. The most promis-ing strategy currently being used to reduce contamination of crops with aflatoxin is to introduce non \u2013 aflatoxin (bi-ological control) A. flavus. The method involves spread-ing non \u2013 aflatoxigenic spores onto the field. It is assumed that addition of the non \u2013 aflatoxin producing strain would then allow it to out \u2013 compete the wild \u2013 type populations and thereby displace the wild \u2013 type fungus. This strategy is called a \u201cdisplacement\u201d strategy. Assuming this is effi-cient, the resulting treated fields should never have to be treated again, because, then, only the non \u2013 aflatoxigenic population of fungi would be present in the fields. Wheth-er or not introduction of biological control strains into the fields is enough to reduce aflatoxin contamination to level required for acceptance of the contaminated food as fit for consumption is still unknown. There is no doubt that bio-logical control strains are able to reduce the size of the pop-ulations of aflatoxin \u2013 producing strains, but the available data suggest that at most only a four \u2013 to five \u2013 fold reduc-tion in aflatoxin contamination is achieved (Ehrlich, 2014).ConclusionAflatoxins are mycotoxins contaminating large pro-portion of the food all around the world. Knowing that aflatoxins are carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic agents and cause different forms of toxicosis (aflatoxico-sis), emphasizes the fact that serious efforts are needed to-wards researching and discovering appropriate strategies for prevention and treatment. The prevention and treatment should be directed towards finding strategies to protect the grains and discovering agents which will be used to protect the human body from the toxic effect of aflatoxins. Aware-ness should be raised in governments to assemble groups of healthcare workers which will contribute to lowering the aflatoxins exposure, and hopefully their elimination.ReferencesCastelino, J.M., Dominguez \u2013 Salas, P., Routledge, M.N., Prentice, A.M., Moore, S.E., Henning, B.J., Wild, C.P., Gong, Y.Y., 2014.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines promotion as: \u201call informational and persuasive activities by manufactur-ers and distributors, the effect of which is to induce the pre-scription, supply, purchase and/or use of medicinal drugs\u201d. In 1989, WHO established ethical criteria for medicines promotion that are still relevant today (WHO, 1988). Ac-cording to the principles of good practice for promoting medicines to the general public, this function is permit-ted for pharmaceuticals classified as nonprescription med-icines (over-the-counter, OTC), but should not be direct-ed at children as target audience. However, the manufac-turers of prescription only medicines are in restrictive po-sition in providing information to patients since the adver-tising of prescription only medicines to the general pub-lic is prohibited. As acknowledge, OTC medicines as part of health coverage are medicines which are approved for use without a medical prescription. These medicines and health-related products from general sale list can be pur-chased by patients and consumers through pharmacies, and in many countries (including our country), from non-phar-macy retail outlets. In this context, as no healthcare pro-fessional is necessarily involved in OTC medicines use it is evident that the nature of their promotion to the gener-al public have a special importance for supporting their ap-propriate and responsible use by patients and consumers. From all these underlying reasons associated with adver-tising and promotion of medicines, it is generally accept-ed that this pharmaceutical function in each country must comply with national health policies and regulations, as well as with standards, guiding principles and ethical crite-ria. Different mechanisms can be used for regulation of ad-vertising of OTC medicines. The aim of our study is to present the elements of ef-ficient and ethical promotion of OTC medicines accord-ing to the WHO standards, and to demonstrate the special role and benefit of OTC medicines promotion in the public health context. Moreover, the preliminary results of con-ducted analysis in the domain of OTC medicines promo-tion on domestic market are also discussed in this context. Materials and methods The varieties of OTC medicines promotional materials available on the domestic market for the provision of pa-tient and consumer information are also analyzed. In fact, approximately 30 OTC medicines from retail environment for pain relievers, laxatives, cough and cold from different manufacturer has been included in the study.  Results and discussionIn general, advertising and promotional materials in-tended to patient and consumer can be available in a va-riety of forms, including: 1) printed material for example leaflets, posters then, materials in newspapers and maga-zines or direct mail materials etc.; 2) electronic media ad-vertising form such as websites and on-line material, 3) au-dio and audiovisual advertising forms (e.g. television, vid-eos or radio commercials); 4) \u2018\u2018other\u2019\u2019 forms (e.g. outdoor advertising, promotional text messages, and so on). WHO describes the purpose of advertising as: \u201cAttract attention, offer choices, and provide limited general infor-mation to mass audiences of consumers. It must stimulate S8 PP 315660Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 659 - 660 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsthe interest of prospective buyers in a\u2026 product; inform them of what it may do for them\u2026 Therefore, advertis-ing should not be overloaded with information to the point that the individual prospective buyer may fail to compre-hend it or may even ignore it\u201d. Overall, the OTC medi-cines promotional materials aimed to raise patient and con-sumer awareness about their condition and, in particular about the possibility for suitable self-medication and self-care. Moreover, these materials should also advice patients and consumer about new products and/or attract their at-tention on the new indications for use of old one OTC med-icines. Another positive benefit of OTC medicines promo-tional material, but not less important, is that they can lead to reinforce of other forms of communication for exam-ple, with health professionals and as a consequence, they should promote and facilitate the rational use of OTC med-icines. The obvious example is the warning information on the promotional material stating: \u201cif symptoms persist, consult a health care professional\u201d. It is well known that the OTC medicines promotional materials play also impor-tant role in patients and consumers decision making pro-cess towards selection of medicines, where there is a mul-tiplicity of choice and also direct them to medicines label-ing important for safe and appropriate use. From the prac-tical point of view, OTC medicines promotional material may also have a positive effect on patient\u2019s compliance. The OTC medicines manufacturers are competing with each other to encourage patients and consumers to use their products.Basic ethical standards for OTC promotion have to en-sure that the information conveyed to patients and consum-ers is truthful and not misleading. The concept of promo-tion is not to force people to buy and use an OTC medi-cine they do not want or need. General ethical criteria for OTC medicine advertising are highlighted in WHO assess-ment document (WHO, 2000): 1)\u201cWhile advertisements to the general public should take account of people\u2019s le-gitimate desire for information regarding their health, they should not take undue advantage of people\u2019s concern for their health\u201d; 2)\u201cWhile health education aimed at children is highly desirable, drug advertisements should not be di-rected at children\u201d; 3)\u201cAdvertisements may claim that a drug can cure, prevent, or relieve an ailment only if this can be substantiated\u201d; 4)\u201cThey should also indicate, where applicable, appropriate limitations to the use of drugs\u201d; 5) \u201cWhen lay language is used, the information should be consistent with the approved scientific data sheet or other legally determined scientific basis for approval. Language which brings about fear or distress should not be used\u201d.These criteria constitute general principles for ethical standards which could be adapted by governments to na-tional circumstances as appropriate to their political, eco-nomic, cultural, social, educational, scientific and techni-cal situation, laws and regulations, and the level of their health system development. It is worthy to mention that in our country these criteria are being fully met.Other important dimension of OTC medicines promo-tion is the mechanism for its regulation. In line with this, it is highly recommended that two systems should be put in place, such as pre-marketing release and post-marketing surveillance system. Actually, the first system formally ap-proved promotional material while, the second one would secure enforcement mechanism.    Patients have a legitimate right to get good quality in-formation, in a well-regulated way, from the reliable source for each OTC medicines.      ConclusionPatients have a legitimate right to get good quality in-formation, in a well-regulated way, from the reliable source for each OTC medicines. In continuum, they are being con-veyed with increasing amounts of OTC medicines promo-tional materials from different parties and through multi-ple channels. It is obvious, that some information might be of varying quality and accuracy. The high standards should be applied in OTC medicines promotion. Apart from eth-ical and effective promotion standards of OTC medicines this regulatory function, alone is not providing detailed and comprehensive information on OTC medicines, but it can convey needed information for responsible self-medication by patients.ReferencesWHO, 1988.

In the Republic of Macedonia the right conditions are in the second half of May and beginning of June, depend-ing on soil-climate conditions and on larger parcels it is done by machines with special constructed combine har-vester or it is done manually.After the harvest, the chamomile is being dried in spe-cial driers which are various, with different capacities for drying and are mainly divided into:1. Driers on solar energy2. Driers on solid fuel3. Driers on oil derivates4. Driers on electric current5. Combined driers1. Principle of work and driers\u2019 role in the chamomile drying processThe chamomile as culture is very specific in the dry-ing process and the harvest depends on the drying process itself. It is harvested the whole and is haymaking, or the flower is collected by combine harvester, depending on the market demands it is intended to. The chamomile contains active and hidden moisture, mainly in the harvest phase. When the flower is collected, it contains about 65% mois-ture that is active and should be lowered to 12% during the drying process, percentage of moisture that allows the chamomile to be stored in various packages, where the dry-ing process continues, and does not harm while is stored, kept, transported or used.2. Techniques and technologies for chamomile dryingChamomile can be dried as flower or as whole plant with the stem and the flower together. From thermal as-pect, and mechanical laws, especially thermodynamics, the drying is done by thermal energy along with cold and hot air circulation. That is the essence of chamomile drying as a culture, because chamomile contains active and hidden moisture and needs strictly defined principle of regulation by temperature amplitudes and air circulation amplitudes, depending on that, time duration of the drying and the con-sumed energy we get the price of cost of this working pro-cess, and the quality as general (Dimov, 2014).The driers are placed in Ltd. \u201cKoro Company\u201d in Sko-pje which is a company main activity that deals with cul-tivation and processing of medical and aromatic plants. The first drier was with smaller dimensions, 5.8 meters in length, 1.55 meters width and 2 m height, 18 m3 cover 12 000 m3 air. The heaters\u2019 energy (capacity) was 60 calories. The second drier was with the following dimensions: 5.8 meters in length, 3.4 meters width and 2 m height. The fan was with 26000 m3 capacity and the heaters had maximum capacity of 160 kg calories.There is proportion of the dimensions of the drier with thermodynamic laws and there was quality drying neces-sary for balance of the inflow, entrance air circulation for time unit and entrance energy which are 2 essential factors for drying, and if the driers have different dimensions, also it is necessary to modify the values of the heaters and the fan that are basic parameters.Materials and methodsMethods - Machines with special constructed combine harvester or it is done manually. Materials - The term Chamomile actually refers to a S8 PP 316662Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 661 - 662 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsrange of different daisy-like plants, which are a member of the Asteraceae family. There are many different species of chamomile, the two most commonly being German chamo-mile (Marticaria recutita) and Roman chamomile (Chamae-melum nobile). They have been used since Ancient times for their calming and anti-inflammatory properties and each offer their own additional health benefits (Dimov, 2014).The chamomile stem is procumbent, and the leaves are alternate, bipinnate, finely dissected, and downy to gla-brous. The chamomile flowers are held in solitary, terminal flowerheads, rising 8-12 inches above the ground. Chamo-mile flowers consist of prominent yellow disk flowers and silver-white ray flowers. The flowers are arranged in con-ical centre (having 18 white rays), receptacle, on which the yellow, tubular florets are placed. Chamomile flowers bloom during the months of June and July. The Chamomile is from from Northeastern Region of Macedonia in Munic-ipality of Rankovce. Results and discussionFrom the obtained results, it can be noticed that dif-ferent volume of the driers 1 and 2, receive different green mass, which in our case is in the center of attention, the factor of height green mass (layer thickness) that are aver-age 45 centimeters.During the measurements it was noticed that chamo-mile layer of 40 cm with three switches had duration for drying of about 24 hours with constantly turned on heaters, and in the case with layer bigger than 45 cm, drier of 2 me-ters height, the process of drying shall be prolonged to 30 hours, with 4 or 5 switches.Only the flower was dried which has structure like this: flower is 70% green mass, and 30% flower lattices. We no-ticed that by each switching, the green mass was damaged and quality lowered. While measuring in both driers, we came to a conclusion that the layer of spread mass should not exceed 40 cm spread on the floor, without any shelves. That conclusion is due to the fact that each harvest has to be done in appropriate weather conditions on temperature above 20 \u00b0C with average air humidity of 40%, which are ideal climate conditions for chamomile harvesting.That was the reason for such measurements and mon-itoring of this issue and we gained wide knowledge for quality of chamomile production and regime of drying and that the quality itself and economy of the final product de-pends on it.ConclusionOur results are contribution in understanding of this medical plant and its process of drying. Obtained results have a contribution in the pharmaceutical industry and give opportunity for future research. It will be worthwhile to perform further studies in order to confirm these results.

Macedonia* elena.salvatore9@yahoo.com, moni-kostovska@hotmail.comIntroductionQuality by design (QbD) principles are implemented into the design and development of microsponges as drug delivery carriers (MDDC) with potential to be incorporat-ed into gel as semi-solid dosage form for topical applica-tion. As a stand for identification and optimization of crit-ical material attributes (CMA) and critical process param-eters (CPP), MDDC particle size was used as it is criti-cal for their encapsulation efficiency, drug loading capaci-ty and drug release profile (properties related to drug prod-uct efficacy and safety). In the previous work of Crcarevs-ka et al. (2015) CMA and CPP were identified using Qual-ity Risk Management (QRM) analysis and hence CPP were further optimized using design of experiments stud-ies. Optimal process conditions for minimal particle size (D10, D50, D90) and minimal distribution (Span factor) were determined to be rotation speed of 24000 rpm and ro-tor\u2013stator homogenizer as type of stirrer used for evapo-ration of organic phase for MDDC preparation by double emulsion-solvent-diffusion technique. Amount of chitosan (CTS), ethylcelulose (EC), span 80 (S80), tween 80 (T80), acetone (ACT), dichlormethane (DHM) and internal water phase (W1) were identified as potentially significant CMA. In this work factorial design of experiments (DoE) was ap-plied for rationalization of previously identified potential-ly significant formulation variables. Afterwards formula-tion optimization of MDDC loaded with clindamycin hy-drochloride was carried out using Central Composite (CC) Response Surface Method (RSM) DoE.Materials and methodsMaterialsEC was purchased from Sigma, USA. CTS (high vis-cous) was supplied from Aldrich, Island. T80, S80 and DHM were obtained from Merck, Germany; while ACT was purchased from Alkaloid, Macedonia. Clindamycin hydrochloride (CM-HCl) was kindly donated by Higija Farm, Bitola, Macedonia. All other used chemicals and re-agents were with analytical grade and were used without any modifications.Methods Determination of statistical significant influence of previously identified CMA (Crcarevska et al., 2015) on particle size (D50) and particle size distribution (Span fac-tor) was carried out using 2 IV7-3 factorial DoE (Design-Expert\uf6da V8 trial, Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, USA). All formulation variables were varied on two levels, with 8 central points. The total of 24 experiments was carried out. Low and high levels of actual values for studied variables were as follows: for factor A: CTS (0.8%) - 0.1 to 0.5 ml, factor B: W1 - 1.5 to 3.5 ml, factor C: ACT - 0.2 to 1 ml, factor D: S80 - 0.03 to 0.13 g, factor E: EC - 0.03 to 0.13 g, factor F: DHM - 6 to 12.5 ml and factor G: T80 - 0.15 to 0.45 g.In order to optimize formulation variables for prepa-ration of MDDC with desired particle size and distribu-tion, as well as drug content and encapsulation efficien-cy, formulation factors identified with factorial DoE, were varied in the relevant design space. For this purpose a to-S8 PP 317664Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 663 - 664 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationstal of 40 experiments were created using face centered CC type Min Run Res V - RSM DoE (Design-Expert\uf6da V8 tri-al, Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, USA). The design ma-trix was constructed in one block where each studied fac-tor was varied at 5 levels (low and high level of factorial and axial points and center point). Used low and high ac-tual values of studied factors were as follows: factor A1 (W1) - 1.5 to 3.5 ml, factor B1 (ACT) - 0.2 to 1 ml, factor C1 (S80) - 0.03 to 0.13 g, factor D1 (DHM) - 6 to 12.5 ml and factor F1 (CM-HCl) - 0.03 to 0.13 g. CTS (0.8%) and T80 amounts were fixed at 0.1 ml and 0.45 g respectively. MDDC were prepared using previously optimized double emulsion-solvent diffusion technique and charac-terized in means of particle size (D10, D50, D90) and parti-cle size distribution (Span factor) (Crcarevska et al., 2015). Results and discussionMDDC were prepared by double emulsion solvent dif-fusion technique using rotor\u2013stator homogenization tech-nique. In the previous work of Crcarevska et al. (2015) for-mulation and process variables that might have critical in-fluence upon drug product quality were identified. Having in mind number of variables identified a sequential strat-egy in the further development of MDDC was selected. Process variables were optimized, and hence the current work is related to detailed characterization of influence of formulation variables on MDDC properties. Results from factorial design studies enabled identification of variables with statically significant influence on D50 and Span fac-tor. D50 of prepared MDDC was in a range of 15.255 \u00b1 0.37 \u00b5m to 220.816 \u00b1 5.23 \u00b5m, while Span factor ranged from 2.612 \u00b1 0.28 to 16.092 \u00b1 0.45. Mathematical mod-els of inverse function of D50 square root and inverse function of Span factor and studied variables were estab-lished. One way ANOVA pointed that factors B (W1), C (ACT), D (S80), E (EC), F (DHM) and factors interaction AF (W1*DHM) and AG (CTS*T80) are significant model terms in case of D50. W1 was determined to be statistical-ly significant in case of Span factor.Based on the obtained results for further studies re-lated to optimization of formulation of MDDC CM-HCl loaded, variables W1, ACT, S80, EC and DHM were se-lected. Also, amount of CM-HCl was considered as for-mulation variable that might influence MDDC properties. Results from CC-RSM studies permitted detailed charac-terization of influence of studied variables on particle size (D10, D50, D90) and particle size distribution (Span fac-tor). D10 of MDDC CM-HCl loaded was in range of 1.375 \u00b1 0. 64 to 64.538 \u00b1 3.22 \u00b5m. Mathematical modeling of log10 (D10) resulted with linear model. One way ANOVA pointed that S80 and EC are statistically significant mod-el terms. D50 for MDDC CM-HCl loaded was in range of 6.582 \u00b1 0.85 \u00b5m to 338.146 \u00b1 8.72 \u00b5m. Reduced qua-dratic model for square root of D50 was established. Vari-ables W1, S80, EC, S80*EC, (EC)2 and (CM-HCl)2 were found to be statistically significant in case of D50. D90 was in a range of 53.104 \u00b1 2.35 \u00b5m to 1235.82 \u00b1 15.46 \u00b5m. Influence of investigated variables on D90 of MDDC CM-HCl loaded could be described by reduced quadrat-ic model. Statically significant model terms were DHM, W1*ACT, W1*DHM, ACT*EC, ACT*CM-HCl, S80*EC, S80*DHM and (ACT)2. Span factor ranged from 1.546 \u00b1 0.37 to 13.841 \u00b1 2.62. Inverse function of square root of Span factor was also modeled by reduced quadratic mod-el. Variables ACT, EC, CM-HCl and interaction terms W1*S0, EC*DHM, DHM*CM-HCl as well as (S80)2 were determined as statistically significant model terms in case of Span factor.ConclusionA sequential experimental strategy was applied in the development of MDDC-CM-HCl loaded. Screening DoE (2 IV7-3 factorial design) was employed for identifi-cation and rationalization of significant formulation vari-ables. Detailed characterization of variable influence upon parameters of interest was performed using Central Com-posite (type Min Run Res V) - Response Surface Meth-od DoE. In the current study results related to particle size and particle size distribution were presented. MDDC-CM-HCl loaded will be further characterized in means of drug content (DC) (mg CM-HCl/g EC  \u00b1 SD, and encapsulation efficiency (EE%) (percentages of mass of entrapped CM-HCl compared to used CM-HCl for preparation of MDDC (%) \u00b1 SD). Obtained results will be used for formulation optimization.ReferencesCrcarevska, M.S., Dimitrovska, A., Sibinovska, N., Mladenovska, K., Slavevska, R.R., Dodov, M.G., 2015.

Cyril and Methodius,  Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* arspirovbt@gmail.comIntroductionPharmacovigilance is the science that allows systemat-ic detecting, gathering, monitoring and evaluation of new data on drug safety and risk/benefit ratio in their use. It is in continuous upswing and it is represented as a control tool which is vital for providing safe, effective and high qual-ity drugs for human use. The specific targets for pharma-covigilance include better patient care and increased safe-ty in the use of drugs, better public health, giving its con-tribution in the assessment of the benefit, hazard, risk and the effectiveness of the use of medicines, encouraging their safe, rational and efficient use and providing education and clinical practice for pharmacovigilance for the public.The new pharmacovigilance legislation came into ef-fect in July 2012 and it was the biggest change to the reg-ulation of human medicines in the European Union since 1995. This new legislative had significant implications for applicants, as well as for patients, healthcare professionals and regulators.The National center for pharmacovigilance in Repub-lic of Macedonia is founded in 1997 in the Institute for preclinical and clinical pharmacology, Medicinal Facul-ty, Skopje. Since 2015 National PV center is transferred in Macedonian agency for Drugs and Medical Devices (MALMED). This center works in accordance with the Na-tional regulative for pharmacovigilance, which has adopt-ed main recommendations from European Union legisla-tion. Since 2002 Macedonia is full member in the Uppsala monitoring center. Although the National center for phar-macovigilance exists for almost twenty years, the aware-ness for reporting adverse drug reactions (ADR) by the healthcare professionals, especially the community phar-macists is on a minimal level. This problem is even big-ger with respect to biosimilars because they are relatively new drugs and very different from the non \u2013 biosimilars in terms of generics.For these reasons we are established a questionnaire that evaluates the main PV questions and accesses the awareness, the knowledge and the methods of application of pharmacovigilance among pharmacists in the communi-ty pharmacies (Meher et al., 2015).Materials and methodsStudy designThis is a questionnaire based study.The study settingThis study is conducted in over 20 community phar-macies in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.The study populationThis is a non \u2013 interventional, but required and useful study which is done among the post graduated pharmacists who work in the community pharmacies. Those who are not willing to participate and those who will not return the questionnaires, are going to be excluded from this study. The study instrumentThe study instrument is validated and predesigned questionnaire which is structured by following other ques-tionnaires from similar studies. This study questionnaire is designed to evaluate the awareness, knowledge and the methods of application of pharmacovigilance in the com-munity pharmacies. S8 PP 318666Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 665 - 666 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentations- The term \u2018awareness\u2019 mean the perception of a situation or a fact.- \u2018Knowledge\u2019 mean the theoretical or practical application of pharmacovigilance.- \u2018Method of application\u2019 is the practical applica-tion of pharmacovigilance.This questionnaire is comprised of 20 questions (awareness \u2013 7, knowledge \u2013 7, methods of application \u2013 6) (Hema et al., 2012)DiscussionThe main aims of pharmacovigilance are the early de-tection of the adverse reactions and interactions, monitor-ing their frequency and identification of the risk factors for the adverse reactions of the drugs and especially of the bi-osimilars. Because of this, active involvement by the com-munity pharmacists is needed in coordination with other healthcare professionals and medical institutions (Hema et al., 2012).With this study we access the awareness, knowledge and the methods of application of pharmacovigilance among the postgraduate pharmacists and pharmacy tech-nicians who work in community pharmacies. We consider that with this study we can provide information which will be significant for the proper education and training for the pharmacists in the future, as well we will gather informa-tion about the real gap between the knowledge and the real experience for reporting adverse drug reactions, especially for biosimilars (Gupta et al., 2015). Also we will determine the factors responsible for under reporting the adverse drug reactions, although we think that a proper education is the most essential factor. For this, the most appropriate time to do so is during the undergraduate and postgraduate train-ing of the pharmacists.To facilitate the activity of phamacovigilance, a cul-ture of learning about it should start early in the profes-sional training of the pharmacy students and postgraduat-ed pharmacists. This will enable the pharmacists to realize that all medicines, including biosimilars can cause adverse drug reactions and learn about the procedures for proper reporting (Hema et al., 2012).ConclusionNowadays, in the well developed countries the need for an efficient pharmacovigilance system has been real-ized more than ever to ensure the safe use of medicines, but that is not the case with the non \u2013 developed countries like ours. For that, after this study there will be an education-al intervention with lectures and workshops on pharmaco-vigilance to understand the importance of pharmacovigi-lance and the necessity of reporting adverse drug reactions.ReferencesGupta, S.K., Nayak, R.P., Shivaranjani, R., Vidyarthi, S.K., 2015.

Cyril and Methodious\u201d, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* blagojachevski@gmail.comBackgroundAccording to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 any analytical equipment used in a testing laboratory should comply to required specifications and perform suitably for its intend-ed purpose to be capable of achieving the required accu-racy for the tests performed, including volumetric glass-ware if it\u2019s use has significant influence on the test result, or the volumetric accuracy is critical to the performance of the method.Volumetric glassware used in analytical laborato-ry may either deliver volume (burettes and bulb burettes, single volume pipettes, one-mark pipettes, bulb burettes, graduated pipettes, including blow-out pipettes) or con-tain a stated volume (one-mark volumetric flasks, graduat-ed measuring cylinders). Most items of volumetric glass-ware are available commercially in two classes, Class A or AS and Class B. The distinction between the two Classes is based principally on the tolerance limits of the nominal vol-ume of the glassware as specified in the relevant Standards. Normally, for a given volume, the tolerance for Class B is twice that for Class A. When the laboratory acquires class A and AS volumetric glassware, it is supplied with a batch calibration certificate, where the tolerance and the error of the material is traceable to an international standard. If the item has been calibrated in-house, the laboratory shall have a documented record of the calibration data showing trace-ability to national standards (UKAS, 2009). The laboratory should identify the needs for calibra-tion and/or verification and develop a policy for manage-ment of the appropriate volumetric glassware. Before be-ing placed in use, laboratory glassware should be calibrat-ed or checked to establish that it meets the laboratory\u2019s re-quirements and complies with the relevant standard spec-ification. Intermediate checks may be needed to maintain the confidence in the calibration status of the glassware, which should be carried out according to a defined proce-dure (ISO/IEC 17025:2005).Marking of volumetric glasswareCommercially available volumetric glassware may be manufactured either from sodalime glass or borosilicate glass and should be marked in accordance with the nation-al/international standard to which it is purchased, with re-gards to the tolerance (Class A or B), capacity in volume unit, reference temperature (i.e. calibration temperature), time of flow/delivery time (for verification or certification purposes for legal metrology) and identification number (Class A). The volumetric glassware should bear also co-lour code (pipettes complying with BS 700 and BS 1583 may be colour coded, in which case the coding shall com-ply with BS 3996), manufacturers and/or vendor\u2019s name or mark (UKAS, 2009).Cleaning of volumetric glasswareThe volume contained in or delivered from volumet-ric glassware depends on cleanliness of the entire internal surface to ensure uniform wetting and performing a well shaped meniscus Cleaning procedures, storage and segre-gation of volumetric equipment may be critical, particular-ly for trace analyses where leaching and adsorption can be significant. The laboratory should establish procedures for the cleaning of the glassware (for hand washing or washing with the washing machine), including cleaning validation protocol considering the possibility of the poor/deficient washing or the cross contamination with cleaning agents, like detergents (ISO 4787, 2010).S8 PP 319668Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 667 - 668 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsAccording to ISO 4787 it is recommended that vol-umetric instruments should not be heated to a tempera-ture considerably above 180 \u00b0C. Washing and drying the glass material for volumetric purposes should be made to a temperature below 90\u00b0C; above 150\u00b0C may be signifi-cant changes in borosilicate glass volumetric capacity of the material and above 90\u00b0C for the soda-lime glass.Qualification of volumetric glasswareQualification of equipment refers to actions of prov-ing and documenting that any analytical equipment com-plies with the required specifications and performs suitably for its intended purpose. The performance of volumetric equipment should be verified at appropriate intervals ac-cording to a plan and procedures established by the labo-ratory, taking into account the type of equipment, the ex-tent of use and supplier\u2019s recommendations (WHO, 2010). The initial level of the qualification of the volumetric glassware should include selection of the volumetric glass-ware that is manufactured according to the requirements of the corresponding ISO standard (ISO 385, ISO 648, ISO 1042 and ISO 4787). The second level of the qualification of the volumetric glassware should include establishment that it meets the laboratory\u2019s requirements and complies with the relevant standard specification, by performing visual inspection of the glassware (compliance with marking requirements), checking the batch calibration certificate of the supplied equipment, or in the cases where certificate is not avail-able, calibration of the volumetric glassware should be per-formed prior use. The need for the calibration of the laboratory glass-ware before first use depends of the volumetric accuracy that is critical to the performance of the method, for which the glassware is intended to be used. The criteria for per-forming the calibration of the volumetric glassware, re-garding the maximum permissible overall error in the test-ing method and maximum specified tolerance for the vol-umetric glassware should be established by each laborato-ry in accordance to the requirements of the corresponding ISO standard (ISO 385, ISO 648, ISO 1042 and ISO 4787).Calibration of the laboratory glassware may be per-formed internally by the authorized (experienced and trained) personnel, according to the suitably documented procedure, developed by the laboratory, or externally by the accredited institution.According to ISO 4787, the general procedure for cali-bration of laboratory glassware is based upon a gravimetric method, for determination of volume of water, either con-tained in or delivered by the volumetric instrument. This volume of water is based upon knowledge of its mass un-der consideration of buoyancy and its tabulated density. The third level of the qualification of the volumetric glassware should include verification of the calibration sta-tus, by performing calibration on the glassware, at regular intervals, depending on the extent and the nature of usage. The initial calibration intervals should be at least once a year. If justified, these intervals may be extended. The fourth level of the qualification of the volumet-ric glassware should include visual inspection of the glass-ware before each use (glass surface shall be free from ob-vious damage, the graduations and inscriptions shall be clearly readable and especially with instruments adjusted to deliver the jet shall be free from damage and allow an unrestricted outflow of liquid). Careful visual inspection of the material in use is made to check for signs of deteriora-tion or attack, such as, scratches, blur glass, broken glass, chipped glass, scale or calibration mark not visible; the de-teriorated material must be rejected (if it would compro-mise the safety of personnel or the purposes for which it intended), or segregated and used for qualitative work or tasks which are compatible with their status. In the case of aggressive uses of this material, such as the use of hydro-fluoric acid or other corrosive substances, thermal shock, mechanical shock, visual inspection should be performed after cleaning and before storing the glassware.ConclusionAnalytical laboratories should confirm the traceabili-ty of volumetric measurements used in support of testing and calibration activities, by establishing procedures for calibration and check of the laboratory glassware used in volumetric measurements. Different national accreditation bodies (NAB) establish different minimum requirements for the volumetric glassware used in a laboratory, with re-gards to the validity of the calibration and the frequency of the verification of the suitability of the volumetric glass-ware. The intervals, methods and the specification criteria for qualification of volumetric glassware are established by each laboratory, taking into account the type of equipment in accordance with the relevant standard requirements.ReferencesISO 385:2005 Laboratory glassware - Burettes, International standard.ISO 648:2008 Laboratory glassware - Single-volume pipettes International standard.ISO 1042:1998 Laboratory glassware - One-mark volumetric flasks.

Cyril and Methodius\u201d, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* Rosana_Trpeska@hotmail.comBackgroundDietary supplements are complex products intended to supplement human diet with nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, extracts or combination of the mentioned ingredients (Sander et al., 2006). The min-erals are inorganic nutrients which are divided in two cate-gories: macro-elements (Na, K, Ca, Mg, P and Cl) and mi-croelements which are also classified as \u201ctrace elements\u201d because of their essentiality at low quantities in humans (Cu, Fe, Ni, Zn, Mn, Se, Co, Cr, Mo, V, F and I) (Gupta and Gupta, 2012). Since the human body cannot synthe-size them, macro and microelements must be    supplied by food or dietary supplements (Lesniewiecz et al., 2006).One of the most important characteristics of a di-etary supplement, from a nutritional point of view, is \u201chow much\u201d macro and microelements are present in the prod-uct. They can be regarded as essential or harmful depend-ing on the concentration, speciation (the distribution among the different chemical compounds) and the presence or ab-sence of other elements (Korfali et al., 2013). Additional-ly, dietary supplements are regulated as food and in many countries they are not subjected to quality control in the same manner as pharmaceutical dosage forms, which is a potential threat to public health (Tumir et al., 2010; Marer-ro et al., 2013). The increased consumption of these prod-ucts, especially in developed countries requires monitor-ing of elemental concentration with emphasis on harmful or potentially harmful elements for human health. There-fore, a multi-element analysis method applicable to vari-ous types of dietary supplements should be used for deter-mination of element content. This review covers the appli-cation of atomic absorption (AA) techniques vs. ICP-OES for determination of macro and microelements in dietary supplements. Comparative assessment of the application of AAS vs. ICP-OES in the analysis of macro and microelements in di-etary supplements The determination of macro and microelements in di-etary supplements has been made utilizing different meth-ods such as X-ray fluorescence, capillary zone electro-phoresis, flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrome-try (ICP-OES) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spec-trometry (ICP-MS). The choice of the method mainly de-pends on the type of dietary supplement and the compo-nents in the matrix. However, the applied methods must have sufficient selectivity and sensitivity, therefore ana-lysts may find that GFAAS, ICP-OES or ICP-MS are the most suitable (Abernety et al., 2010).   GFAAS is a frequently used technique for determina-tion of macro and microelements as well as trace metals in biological, clinical, food, environmental or geological ma-trices. It is capable of detecting low concentrations (parts per billion, ppb, w/w) in microliter quantities of the sam-ple (Lewen, 2011). Although this technique is relatively in-expensive, it can be used only for single-element analy-sis. Also, non-metals cannot be determined because their atomic absorption wavelengths are in far UV range which is not suitable for analysis due to absorption of air compo-nents (Baysal et al., 2013).  Plasma-based techniques have gradually gained im-portance in verifying whether food specimens, dietary sup-plements and pharmaceutical products comply with health requirements and/or national or international regulations. These techniques can be applied to all possible matrices S8 PP 320670Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 669 - 670 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsand analytes. They are characterized by extended dynam-ic concentration range (several orders of magnitude) and are multi-elemental in nature, thus they possess high sensi-tivity and suitable detection power (Marrero et al., 2013). Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spec-trometry (ICP-OES) is a multi-element technique that al-lows the determination of major, minor and trace elements in complex samples. This technique offers high sample through output enabling analysis of large batches, simul-taneous determination of many elements in a single sam-ple, large dynamic liner range and low chemical and ma-trix interferences (Gupta and Gupta, 2012). For the major-ity of analyses for ICP-OES it is necessary to convert solid samples into liquid solution by acid digestion. For this pur-pose, the closed \u2013vessel microwave oven has been used, due to short heating times, reduced risk of contamination and low volume reagent requirements. The utilization of closed-vessel microwave oven improves limits of detec-tion of ICP-OES at the same time reducing reagent quanti-ties and cost of analysis. Given all the advantages of ICP-OES as well as the characteristics of the dietary supple-ments (complex matrix, presence of various elements in wide range of concentrations), it is slowly but surely be-coming the method of choice for determination of mac-ro and microelements in different types of dietary supple-ments (Barbosa et al., 2015; Castro et al., 2009; Marrero et al., 2013; Pytlakovska et al., 2012).     Conclusion The data clearly demonstrates the effectiveness and productivity of ICP-OES as compared to more traditional methods such as atomic absorption spectrometry. The ICP-OES can make measurements across a wide range of con-centrations, thus allowing the analysis of a single solution per sample for all the elements of interest. In future, it seems more likely that sensitive methods such as ICP-OES will be-gin to play even greater role in the analysis of macro and mi-croelements in different types of dietary supplements. The performances of modern ICP-OES instruments make it pos-sible to meet the challenges of the complicated dietary sup-plement matrix and low limits of detection in order to ad-dress both product safety as well as product quality.

Spreng. fam. Ericaceae, also known as red bearberry, bearberry or bear\u2019s ear,  is a trailing, evergreen woody ground cover shrub with pad-dle-shaped leaves on flexible branches. It has thick, leath-ery leaves, rolled under the edges, which are yellow-green in spring, dark green in summer and reddish-purple in the fall, remaining on the bearberry for 1-3 years before fall-ing. The flowers are small, white or pink, bell-shaped and grouped in nodding clusters that bloom in summer. The fruits are white-red berries and they persist into winter. The bearberry is widely distributed on a global level.The use of bearberry leaves for the first time was lit-erally documented in the middle Ages in the Welsh \u201cPhy-sicians of Nyddfai\u201d from the 13th century. From the be-ginning of 19th century, bearberry is in official use. It was used for treatment of different diseases such as hydrops, lithiasis, in diabetes, for the therapy of gonorrhoea, etc. Nowadays only the use as urinary tract antiseptic and di-uretic remains due to the presence of arbutin and hydroqui-none (Jurica et. al., 2015). The herb also contains tannins that have a powerful astringent effect and protect from ear-ly stage of infections (Head, 2008). The usual form of ad-ministration is as infusion and it is of great value in diseas-es of the bladder and kidneys, it strengthens and tones the urinary passages. In Republic of Macedonia the natural populations of bearberry represent a unique source of leaves which are distributed in the following areas: Skopje Valley, moun-tains of Jakupica, Karadzica, Dautica, Shar Mountain, Os-ogovo Mountains and Mariovo. The knowledge of the tex-ture of these soils has a great importance, since these soils are formed only on certain substrates (pure and compact limestones and dolomites), where all physical, physical \u2013 mechanical, chemical and biological properties greatly de-pend on the parent material.  The mechanical composition of these soils varies extensively and depends on the me-chanical composition of the residuum from which the min-eral part of the soil is composed, on the character of the limestone and the dolomite (the degree of weathering and silicification), on the deposition of nearby materials (from the higher fields) and on the degree of erosion (Filipovs-ki, 1997). Bearberry thrives on rocky ground in the light woods of black and white pine and in subalpic plant communities on limestone and dolomite ground. The content of bear-berry is tightly connected to the environmental conditions. Basic precondition for normal growth are the soils which is important to be rich in CaCO3. According to the field surveys the bearberry mostly grows on two soil types: cal-comelanosol, regosol (WRB, 2006). Here in Republic of Macedonia there are soils formed upon lime stones and do-lomites (Markoski et. al., 2013). Also important conditions for this plant are the climate conditions and sea level. Bear-berry usually lives at sea level over 1500 m on soils with high humidity, it cannot be seen in urban areas. Although it is an indigenous species for this region there is no liter-ature data for the composition of the soils that bearberry thrives on.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze the min-eral composition of the soils that bearberry grows on.S8 PP 321672Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 671 - 672 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsMaterials and methodsSoil samples S2, S3, S4 and S6 collected from four lo-cations on Mountain Korab, where bearberry populations are growing.Soil samples were collected from 10cm, 20cm and 30cm depth and used in ruined condition for the laboratory analyzes. The mean values are given in the results.The following methods were used for the analyses of the soils:- pH (reaction) of the soil solution was deter-mined electrometrically with a glass electrode in a water suspension and a suspension of 1M HCl (Mitrikeski andMitkova, 2006),- Content of CaCO3 determineted by Schebler calcimetar (Mitrikeski and Mitkova, 2006),- Content of organic matter was determined ac-cording to total Carbon (Orlov et. al.. 1981),- Total N was determined by calculation (Fili-povski, 1974),- Easily available forms of  Phosphorus and Potassium were determined by Al-method (Pelivanovska, 2011),- Determination of cations (Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) was done on Agilent Technolo-gies 700 Series ICP \u2013 OES.Results and discussionCommon chemical characteristics of the soil (pH, CaCO3, organic matter, total N, P2O5, K2O) were evaluat-ed. The obtained data showed pH=7.7 for S2, pH=8 for S3, pH=7.9 for S4 and pH=7.6 for S6 in a water soil suspen-sion. The values of the pH reaction of the soil solution were closely correlated with the content of CaCO3. Highest val-ue for CaCO3 was found in S3 (60.81%) and lowest in S2 (44.16%). Regarding the content of easily accessible forms of Phosphorus and Potassium, these soils are poor in P2O5 and little to middle supplied with K2O.The presence of target elements (CaO, Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) was analyzed with ICP OES. CaO was most present in S3 and least in S6, Al was most present in S2 and least in S3, Fe was most present in S2 and least in S3, Mg was most present in S6 and least in S3, Mn was most present in S6 and least in S3, Cr was most present in S2 and least in S4, Cu was most present in S2 and least in S3, Ni was most present in S2 and least in S4, Pb was most present in S4 and least in S3, Zn was most present in S4 and least in S3.ConclusionBearberry population viability and the content of bio-active compounds in bearberry are tightly connected to the environmental conditions. pH value of analyzed samples varied from 7.6 to 7.9. Precondition for normal growth of this plant that lives on limestone and dolomite ground are the soils which is important to be rich in CaCO3 and highest value of CaCO3 (60.81%) found in S3 and lowest (44.16%) found in S2 confirms that. CaO was most present in S3 and least in S6. These soils are poor in P2O5 and lit-tle to middle supplied with K2O. Regarding cations, when the analyzed soil samples were compared between them self, S2 was richest in Fe, Cr, Ni and Cu and S6 in Mg and Mn; S3 was poorest with Al, Fe, Mg, Mn, Cu, Pb and Zn.ReferencesFilipovski, G., 1997.

Amygdalin is hydrolysed in the pres-ence of the enzyme amygdalase and water, involving a two-stage process to produce glucose along with an agly-cone made up of benzaldehyde and odourless hydrocyanic acid. Natural amygdalin has a dextrorotatory (R) configu-ration that is considered to be the active form. Neo-amyg-dalin is its inactive (S) isomer and does not occur in nature. Isoamygdalin is the name of the mixture of the epimers R-amygdalin and S-amygdalin. The term \u2018laetrile\u2019 (D-man-delonitrile-\u00df-glucuronide) is an acronym from laevorotato-ry and mandelonitrile, used to describe a purified form of amygdalin (Fenselau et al., 1977). The occurrence of cya-nogenic glycosides is widespread. Amygdalin is very com-mon among plants of the Rosaceae, particularly the Prunus genus. This includes not only the bitter almond but also the kernels of apricots, peaches and plums (Pengelly, 2004). Hydrocyanic acid, which is the product of the hydrolysis of amygdalin reflexively stimulates the respiratory center and produces antitussive and antiasthmatic effects (Lv et al., 2005).Amygdalin is supposed to be useful in tretman of can-cer, but still there is no reliable clinical evidence for this in-dication (Blahata et al., 2016). Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the anticancer effects of amygdalin, among them, amygdalin enhances the functions of pancre-atic enzymes, which may prevent transformation of can-cer primordial germ cells or has the capacity to restores the vitamin deficiency that could lead to metabolic disorders in cancer patients (Chang et al., 2006). Moreover, treat-ment with high concentrations of amygdalin on the human DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells can induce apop-totic cell death (Chang et al., 2006). On the other hand, Chang et al. (2005) reported that Armeniacae semen con-taining abundant amygdalin exhibits analgesic and anti-in-flammatory effects, showing that low doses of amygdalin may relieve pain.Amygdalin is water and methanol soluble. Traditional-ly, the extraction method of the chemical ingredients in the plant materials is decoction in boiling water. Other meth-ods used are soxhlet extraction and reflux extraction (Lv et al., 2005). Ultrasonic extraction with boiling methanol can be also applied to extract amygdalin from plant ker-nels. The last method is promising, because some amyg-dalin is decomposed into benzaldehyde, HCN, and glu-cose by emulsion (a hydrolysis enzyme present in kernels), and some are converted into its epimers, neoamygdalin (L- mandelonitrile-\u03b2-D-gentiobioside) during the process of decoction in water. Other way for inhibiting the conver-sion of amygdalin to neoamygdalin is by changing the pH (adding citric acid in the medium for extraction).The determination and quantification of amygdalin was performed mainly by high-performance liquid chro-matography (HPLC) (Wasserkrug et al., 1997). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the amygdalin content in kernels of Prunus cerasifera, Prunus armeniaca and Prunus domestica, as well as in commercial available food supplement using HPLC method.Materials and methodsPlant materialKernels of Prunus armeniaca, Prunus cerasifera and Prunus domestica were purchased from a green market, while the food supplement containing extract of Prunus ar-meniaca kernels was purchased from pharmacy store. S8 PP 322674Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 673 - 674 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsExtractionThe seeds from the kernels were pulverized by means of a blender. 0.5 g of each sample (including the content from the capsule) was extracted with 25 mL boiling meth-anol with ultrasonic bath under reflux for 30 min. The tem-perature of system was the boiling point of methanol. Af-ter extraction, the extracts were filtered through a filter pa-per in 25 cm3 flask. Furthermore, 1.5 mL of the extracts were additionally filtered through disposable Econofilter 25/0.45 \u03bcm RC pore size and injected in the HPLC sys-tem for analysis.Quantification of amygdalin was performed using UV/VIS DAD at 215 nm with calibration standard of amygda-lin prepared as 0.1 mg/mL stock in methanol. HPLC methodChromatographic analyses were performed on an Ag-ilent 1200 HPLC/DAD system equipped with quaternary pump G1311A, column thermostat G1316A TCC, thermo-statted autosampler G1329A TCC, and controlled by LC 3D software (Wilmington DE). Separation was achieved using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C-18 column (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm, Agilent, Germany), protected with a guard col-umn (4 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, RP-18, 5 \u03bcm, Agilent, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water of HPLC grade in ratio 15:85 (v/v). The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the injection volume was 20 \u03bcL.Results and discussionWith HPLC analysis amygdalin was identified in the extracts of the kernels from the samples of Prunus arme-niaca, Prunus cerasifera and according to Rt and UV/VIS spectra corresponding to the Rt and UV/VIS spectra of the peak in the HPLC chromatogram of amygdalin standard. We were unable to identify amygdalin in the sample of Prunus domestica. In the Prunus armeniaca kernels 4.89% of amygdalin was determined, while in Prunus cerasifera kernels amygdalin content was 2.64%. On the other hand, in the commercial food supplement preparation 17.86% of amygdalin was quantified that complied with the declared amount of amygdalin. ConclusionAn extraction procedure and high performance liquid chromatography method were successfully developed and applied for determination of amygdalin in plant material as well in pharmaceutical preparation/extract that can be fur-ther utilized for amygdalin content determination in var-ious natural and pharmaceutical samples. Using, HPLC the amygdalin was quantified in kernels of Prunus cera-sifera (26.4 mg/g DW), and Prunus armeniaca (48.9 mg/g DW) and these data can serve as a starting point for fur-ther investigations and assessment of other natural sourc-es of amygdalin.

These kinds of drinks contain an extracts of Foeniculum vulgare or seldom Pimpinella anisum. Sometimes estrogenic ef-fects can be observed when they are consumed by female human population. These estrogenic effects are manifest-ed with stimulation of the lactic secretion, stimulation of menstruation or facilitate birth. In man population can re-lieves the symptoms of climacterium (Albert-Puleo, 1980). One of the components which are responsible for estro-genic activity is dianethol, which is formed after the fu-sion of two molecules of cis-anethole, but there is infor-mation that trans-anethole has also estrogenic effects (Ku-levanova, 2004).There are also some studies on laboratory animals as-sessing the bioactivity of trans-anethole. When adminis-tered orally to immature female rats at 80 mg/kg b.w. for 3 days significantly increased uterine weight to 2 g/kg com-pared to 0.5 g/kg in controls and 3 g/kg in animals giv-en estradiol valerate subcutaneously at 0.1 \u00b5g/rat/day (p < 0.001). The results confirmed that trans-anethole has estro-genic activity. On the other hand, some other experiments showed that it has no anti-estrogenic, progestational, anti-progestational, androgenic or anti-androgenic activity. Es-trogenic activity of trans-anethole at high concentrations has been determined by a sensitive and specific bioassay using recombinant yeast cells expressing the human estro-gen receptor (Howes et al., 2002).The aim of the research was to analyze potential estro-genic components like trans-anethole and cis-anethole in alcoholic beverages OUZO, MASTIKA and YENI RAKI using GC-FID-MS technique.Materials and methodsSamples: Alcoholic beverages: commercially pur-chased alcoholic spirit \u2013 OUZO; commercially purchased alcoholic spirit \u2013 YENI RAKI; commercially purchased alcoholic spirit \u2013 MASTIKA and traditionally homemade MASTIKA.Sample preparation: 100 \u03bcL of each beverage were di-luted to 1000 \u03bcL with methanol and analyzed on GC/FID/MS.GC/FID/MS analysis: Samples were analysed with an Agilent 7890\u0410 Gas Chromatography system equipped with FID detector and Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer. For this purpose, an HP-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 \u03bcm) was used. Adams\u2019 analytical conditions were as follows: oven temperature at 60 \u00b0C (0 min), 3 \u00b0C/min to 240 \u00b0C (1 min) and at the end increased to 280 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/min (1 min) (Adams, 2007); he-lium, as carrier gas, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min (at the end of analysis we eluted 10 more minutes with helium with aim to separate some of the components in extract enough well); injector temperature 220 \u00b0C and that of the FID de-tector 270 \u00b0C. One \u03bcL of each EO was injected at split ra-tio 1:1. The mass spectrometry conditions were: ionisation voltage 70 eV, ion source temperature 230 \u00b0C, transfer line temperature 280 \u00b0C and mass range from 50 - 550 Da. The MS was operated in scan mode.Identification of the components: The components were identified according to the literature (Adams, 2007), and Kovat\u2032s (retention) indices determined using a homol-ogous mixture of normal alkanes (C9-C25) analysed un-der Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identi-S8 PP 323676Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 675 - 676 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsfication System (AMDIS) conditions (AMDIS ver.2.1.). Confirmation was by comparing the mass spectra of com-ponents present in the extracts with reference spectra ob-tained from NIST, Wiley and Adams\u2019 mass spectra librar-ies. Quantification of extracts components was performed using the normalisation method of the GC/FID peak areas with no correction factors (Adams, 2007).Results and discussionUsing GS/FID/MS analysis five different compo-nents were identified in OUZO sample (2-butanol (5.92%), 1-buten-3-ol (7.65%), anis aldehyde (9.50%), trans-ane-thole (23.98%), 1(1\u2019-azetinidyl)-2,6-dimetil-1-cyclohex-an (8.06%) and 4-metoxyphenyl ((2-methylenecyclohex-yl)methanol), four different components in a sample of homemade MASTIKA (estragol \u2013 7.42%), cis-anethole (42.38%), trans-anethole (35.09%), 3-metoxy-2meth-yl-2H-pyrazolo[4,3,3-E][1,2,4]triazin \u2013 8.52%) and a sin-gle component of trans-anethole in the YENI RAKI and commercial purchase MASTIKA (100% trans-anethole). This indicates that in traditionally homemade MASTIKA and commercial OUZO an extract of aniseed or sweet fen-nel seed was added or plant seeds were used in the pro-cess of production or distillation. On the other hand sin-gle peak of trans-anethole in the YENI RAKI and the com-mercial available MASTIKA indicates that probably a pure compound of trans-anethole was added into the produc-tion process. The amount of trans-anethole was highest in the sample of YENI RAKI, almost twice higher compared with the OUZO sample, two and half times higher than commercial MASTIKA and approximately 5x higher than in the sample of traditionally homemade MASTIKA. cis-Anethole was identified only in the sample of traditional-ly homemade MASTIKA and was present in amount even higher than trans-anethole. This can be explained with the fact that trans-anethole has been converted into cis-ane-thole during the four years period of storage, consequent-ly possessing probably higher estrogenic potency than the other analyzed samples.ConclusionFor the purposes of this research, a method of GC/MS/FID was applied for determination of the target compo-nents, particularly cis- and trans- isomers of anethole, in alcoholic beverages. YENI RAKI has highest content of trans-anethole, followed by OUZO and MASTIKA, com-mercial and homemade. Further research is needed in order to evaluate the relationship between the content of these compounds and their respective estrogenic potential.ReferencesAdams, R.P., 2007.

Cyril and Methodius\u201d,  Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* veronikaangelovska@gmail.comIntroductionThe genus Hypericum consists of about 470 species of flowering plants that occur in all temperate parts of the world (Robson, 2003). Well known medicinally valuable species Hypericum perforatum (common St. John\u2019s Wort) is native to parts of Europe and Asia but has been spread worldwide as a cosmopolitan invasive weed including tem-perate regions of Canada, United States and Africa, as well. Chemical investigations of Hypericum perforatum have detected several groups of medicinally active com-pounds. The most common classes include naphthodian-thrones (hypericin, pseudohypericin, hyperforin, adhy-perforin), phloroglucinols, catechins and proanthocyani-dins, flavonoids and biflavonoids (hyperoside, querci-trin, isoquercitrin, rutin, biapigenin, amentoflavone), xan-tones (noratbyrol), phenolic acids and other phenolic com-pounds, antraquinone derivatives, as well as essential oils. The phytochemical investigation of Hypericum perforatum essential oil mainly began with the determination of the es-sential oil content. According to some authors, it is a highly variable value and ranges from 0.1% to 1% (Klemow et al., 2011; Robson, 2003) hence this species is considered as es-sential oil poor plant. Concerning the literature data, there have been numerous investigations of the chemical com-position of Hypericum perforatum essential oil. The ma-jor constituents were found to be monoterpenes (\u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, limonene, myrcene, geraniol and \u03b1-terpineol), sesquiterpenes (\u03b2-caryophyllene and caryophyllene oxide) as well as aliphatic (2-methyloctan, n-nonan, n-undecan, n-octanal and n-decanal) and saturated hydrocarbons (do-decanole, 3-methylnonane, isoundecane and undecane) that could be present in appreciable concentrations (Bertoli et al., 2011; Crockett, 2010; Robson, 2003). The widespread popularity of Hypericum perforatum usage as an herbal remedy results from its efficacy in a treatment of a variety of diseases. This plant has been used over thousands of years to treat cuts, abrasions, bruises, sunburns and other wounds as well as to treat anxiety, de-pression and rheumatic pain. Also, this plant is thought to possess antiseptic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and gastro-protective effects (Crockett, 2010).   Despite the numerous literature data about the chemi-cal composition of the Hypericum perforatum essential oil, still there is no officially available data about the chemistry of essential oil isolated from Macedonian species, there-fore the principal aim of our further research study will be assessment of the chemical composition of essential oil ob-tained from the aerial parts of this plant harvested from its natural habitats in R. Macedonia.Materials and methodsThe plant material of investigated Hypericum perfo-ratum populations is generally consisted of air-dried aeri-al parts collected during the flowering stage, packed in pa-per bags and kept in a dark and cold place until analysis. The essential oil isolation is usually made from dried and properly minced plant material by steam distillation in all-glass Clevenger apparatus according to standard meth-od described in European Pharmacopeia. The common method of choice for the investigation of chemical composition of the essential oil is gas chroma-tography tandem mass spectrometry (Bardhi et al., 2015).Results and discussionData analysis of the chemical composition of Hyper-icum perforatum essential oil isolated from species origi-S8 PP 324678Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 677 - 678 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsnating from southern Albania revealed six different classes of components: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygen-con-taining monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxy-gen-containing sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and non-terpene components. Generally, monoterpene (1.94-47.21%) and sesquiterpene (6.67-50.88%) hydrocarbons were dominant fractions in all tested samples. Beside terpene compounds, these essential oils contain high levels of other non-terpene components (11.68-29.25%) mainly consisted of aliphatic chains. GC/FID/MS analyses of the examed essential oils revealed a total of 126 compounds from which seven com-pounds were found in amounts higher than 3.00%: \u03b1-pinene (2.03\u201336.74%), \u03b2-pinene (0.36\u20136.89%), 2-methyl-decane (0.82\u20133.14%), carvacrol (0.14\u20135.60%), trans-(E)-caryoph-yllene (0.5\u201319.27%), \u03b2-selinene (1.34\u201313.86%) and caryo-phyllene oxide (1.15\u201312.35%) (Bardhi et al., 2015). The main fraction of compounds in Hypericum perforatum es-sential oils obtained from plant material collected in south-eastern Serbia were found to be sesquiterpenes (57.7%), followed by monoterpenes (22.4%), both mostly consisted of hydrocarbons. Other components present in this oil were non-terpene compounds (18.1%); alkanes, isoalkanes, n-alkanes, anteiso-alkanes and fatty acids and their deriva-tives. The main components were found to be germacrene D (18.6%), (E)-caryophyllene (11.2%), 2-methyloctane (9.5%), \u03b1-pinene (6.5%), bicyclogermacrene (5.0%) and (E)-\u03b2-ocimene (4.6%) (\u00d0or\u0111evi\u0107, 2015). The essential oil of Hypericum perforatum collected from different localities in Lithuania was rich in \u03b2-caryophyllene (5.1-19.1%) and caryophyllene oxide (6.1-35.8%), followed by germacrene D (4.5-31.5%), spathulenol (3.9-8.5%), \u03b2-farnezene (0.6-8.2%), \u03b1-muurolene-14-ol (1.6-9.1%) and \u03b1-cadinol (2.2-6.2%). In this study, all tested samples, the amount of the most abundant fractions, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, comprised 62.0-81.8% of the essential oils (Mockut\u0117 et al., 2003). Chemical investiga-tion of the essential oil composition of Hypericum perfo-ratum was also made on plant material collected from Tur-key. GC/MS analysis has shown that the main constituents were monoterpenes: \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene and \u03b2-myrcene, followed by sesquiterpenes: \u03b1-copaene, (E)-caryophyllene and \u03b1-selinene. Hydrocarbons (nonane, decane, 2, 6-di-methyl decane and undecane) and aldehydes (hexanal) were also identified in the essential oil (Derun et al., 2013).ConclusionConcerning the literature data, some similarity in the chemical composition of essential oil obtained from the aerial parts of Hypericum perforatum collected from Al-bania and Serbia could be found, probably due to the influ-ence of appropriate environmental conditions. In our fur-ther research study, we can expect similar chemistry in es-sential oil isolated from Hypericum perforatum harvested from its natural habitats in R. Macedonia which can help to assess the potential of this plant for its further sustain-able exploitation.ReferencesBardhi, N., Stefkov, G.,  Karapandzova, M., Cvetkovikj, I., Kulevanova, S., 2015.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* marijabrezovska@gmail.comIntroductionOrganic solvents are widely used in the manufactur-ing process of pharmaceutical products. Their application in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients is of exceptional importance since the use of specific solvents can determine the physicochemical characteristics, influ-ence the yield of the synthetic reaction and purity of the product. Organic solvents are also routinely applied in the manufacturing of excipients and during the drug product formulation. Using standard manufacturing processes or-ganic solvents are generally removed to the extent possible from the final product. Small amounts that remain in the final drug product are commonly referred as residual sol-vents (RS). Their presence, even at low levels, may influ-ence the efficacy, safety and stability of the pharmaceutical products (Grodowska and Parczewski, 2010). Regulation on residual solvents testingICH regulation The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceu-ticals for Human Use, under ICH Topic Q3C (published in December 1997), require for \u201ctesting to be performed for residual solvents when production or purification process-es are known to result in the presence of such solvents\u201d. ICH categorizes commonly used RS into three differ-ent classes based on their toxicity: Class 1 (solvents to be avoided), Class 2 (solvents to be limited), Class 3 (solvents with low toxic potential). The European Pharmacopoe-ia (Ph. Eur.) and The United states Pharmacopoeia (USP) limit the amount of RS in pharmaceuticals, considering the ICH guidelines for RS. The control limits for RS are for-mulated based on the potential risks when the drug is ad-ministered orally. Class 1 contains known solvent that are human carcinogens, compounds strongly suspected of be-ing human carcinogens, and environmental hazard. The limits for Class 1 solvents are between 2-8 ppm except for 1,1,1-trichloroethane 1500 ppm, due to its environmental hazard.  Class 2 solvents are non-genotoxic animal carcin-ogens or possible causative agents of irreversible toxicity and their concentration limits vary between 50 and 3880 ppm. Class 3 solvents have low toxic potential and have been found less toxic in acute or short-term studies and negative in genotoxicity studies. Their limit of 5000 ppm is acceptable without justification. A higher amount may also be acceptable with proper justification. ICH Q3C (R5) guideline for residual solvents also sets criteria for analytical methods used to identify and quanti-fy these residual solvents as well provide acceptable con-centration limits. Ph. Eur (3rd edition) and USP (USP 28,) have adopted this guideline and have revised their general methods to reflect it.European PharmacopoeiaIn general chapter of Ph. Eur, Identification and con-trol of residual solvents, two different methods for quali-tative and quantitative analysis of RS: System-A and Sys-tem-B are described. Gas chromatography (GC) with head-space (HS) injection is proposed in two systems (A and B). System A utilize fused-silica capillary wide-bore column (30m x 0.32mm or 0.53mm i.d) coated with cross-linked 6 % polycyanopropylphenylsiloxane and 94 % polydimeth-ylsiloxane while  System B uses  fused-silica capillary wide-bore column (30 m x 0.32 mm or 0.53 mm i.d.) coat-ed with macrogol 20000R. System A is preferred whilst S8 PP 325680Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 679 - 680 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsSystem B is employed for confirmation of identity. Three different sample preparation procedures are pro-posed based on the sample solubility\u2014I: water for the wa-ter soluble samples; II: DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) for the water insoluble samples; III: DMI (1,3-dimeth-yl-2-imidazolidinone) for the control of DMF and DMA (N,N-dimethylacetamide) in water insoluble samples. In the case of water soluble samples where water insoluble RS are present, the reference RS solutions in water are pre-pared using DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) as bridging sol-vent. Moreover, the Ph. Eur. takes into account the possi-bility of using, apart from FID, a mass spectrometer (MS) or electron capture detector (ECD). MS and ECD detectors are proposed as alternatives for FID in the analysis of chlo-rinated RS of Class-1 due to the poor sensitivity of FID to-wards chlorinated solvents.United States PharmacopoeiaCurrent official methods for residual solvent determi-nation are described in chapter Organic Volatile Impurities. USP chapter <467> suggests analysis of residual solvents using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ion-ization detector (FID) and an automated headspace sampler (HS). The three testing procedures are used to screen and identify (Procedure A), confirm (Procedure B) and quan-titatively determine (Procedure C) the residual solvents in the sample. When the user has information about the spe-cific solvents utilized during the manufacturing of the arti-cle, only Procedure C needs to be performed. If the solvents used are unknown, all three procedures are needed for iden-tification and quantization. These three procedures (A, B, C) differ among themselves in column type (film-coatings G43 A or G16 and dimensions) and in chromatographic conditions. Procedure A in the USP <467> General Chapter has the same chromatographic and headspace conditions as in System A. Similarly, Procedure B finds its equivalent in Ph. Eur. in the system configuration of System B.Sample preparation is different for water-soluble and water-insoluble articles. Three different headspace conditions are available al-though USP does not specify which HS conditions should be chosen. These are dependent on the solvent that was chosen for preparation of the sample (water or N,N-di-methylformamide), residual solvents under analysis (high or low boiling) and analyzed material (thermally stable or unstable).According to USP, determination of class 3 RS can be also done by loss on drying (USP <731> Chapter), as long as the total loss on drying is less than the maximum accept-able limit for class 3 residual solvents (5000 ppm).USP general procedures do not relate to specific sol-vents, but they try to compromise chromatographic and headspace conditions, in order to analyze all or the majori-ty of organic solvents mentioned in chapter <467>. Conclusion Methods for analysis of residual solvents described in pharmacopoeias are gas chromatographic methods that dif-fer in procedures for sample preparation and headspace pa-rameters. Proposed stationary phases for chromatographic columns and their intended used are the same. In Ph. Eur. mass spectrometer or electron capture detectors have been additionally taken into account (apart from FID). General-ly, all methods for quantitative determination of residual solvents taken from pharmacopoeias need validation.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* filip_cvetanovski@rocketmail.comBackgroundFalsification of medicines is a global problem that should be addressed with deep attention and interest. This problem represents a threat to the well-being, health and even the life of the patients, and cause a great damage on the economy and society. A medicine can be falsified regarding its identity, in-cluding its packaging and everything that is visible on it: the marking, the ingredients, the quantity of ingredients; its source (the manufacturer, the land of origin, the coun-try where it is manufactured, the marketing authorization holder) and the documents regarding the channels of dis-tribution. Falsified medicines may contain different quan-tity of the active ingredient, wrong active ingredient or no active ingredient, wrong excipients and are produced in sub-standard manufacturing conditions. Therefore the use of falsified medicine may result in no therapeutic effect or even negative effect on patient\u2019s health. Additionally, falsi-fied medicines undermine the credibility of the health care systems, leading to a reduction in patient trust in the le-gal supply chain of medicines and spend valuable human and financial resources. Innovative pharmaceutical com-panies invest in pharmaceutical development to assure the quality, safety, efficacy of their respective products order to provide maximal therapeutic effect with minimum side effects. In contrary, the main goal of the manufacturers of falsified medicines is easy money. Falsified medicines may also cause loss of the credibility and reputation of the phar-maceutical companies (Council of Europe, 2013a; WHO, 2008).The \u201clife-cycle\u201d of falsified product involves unau-thorized manufacturers, brokers, illegal/unregulated sup-plier, wholesalers, and unregulated internet. Patients re-ceive falsified medicines easily without them knowing that the product is not what it is declared to be, not being aware of the consequences, the effect of these products, the in-ternet, and the manufacturers are encouraged to enter this business because it is extremely profitable and in many countries unregulated (MHRA, 2012).Taking into the account the threat and the extent of the phenomenon with the falsified medicines, a serious multi-lateral approach is necessary which includes taking mea-sures to combat the falsification of medicines at both the national and global level. Legislation in EUThe European Union (EU) has a strong legal frame-work for the licensing, manufacturing and distribution of medicines, centered around the Directive on falsified med-icines for human use (21. 07. 2011 - EU Directive 2011/62 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/83/EC) as regards the prevention of the en-try into the legal supply chain of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source, so that only licensed pharmacies and approved retailers are allowed to offer medicines for sale, including legiti-mate sale via the internet (Council of Europe, 2011).  Ac-cording to EU Directive 2011/62, falsified medicine is de-fined as any medicinal product with a false representation of: its identity, including its packaging and labeling, its name or its composition as regards any of the ingredients including excipients and the strength of those ingredients; its source, including its manufacturer, its country of manu-facturing, its country of origin or its marketing authoriza-tion holder; or its history, including the records and docu-ments relating to the distribution channels used. This def-inition does not include unintentional quality defects and is without prejudice to infringements of intellectual prop-S8 PP 326682Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 681 - 682 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationserty rights. According to EMA and the Directive, there are going to be different penalties and allegations for falsify-ing and counterfeiting medicines. This Directive aims to prevent falsified medicines entering the legal supply chain and reaching patients. It introduces harmonized safety and strengthened control measures across Europe by applying new measures, which can be grouped into four main pil-lars: safety features of medicines, supply chain and good distribution practice, active substances and excipients and internet sales.The Medicrime convention is the tool which EMA uses to criminalize the falsification of medicines. It gives directions on strategic approach for development the le-gal framework in the field of medicinal products, both na-tionally and internationally in order to better protect pub-lic health and national healthcare systems, through coop-eration between sectors in public administration, measures for national control, preventative measures etc. (Council of Europe, 2013b). Legislation in USAEMAs equivalent in the USA is the FDA. It is a fed-eral agency and is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is responsible for taking care of the general health, among other things, and therefore pro-vides legislation about falsified medicines. What the DI-RECTIVE 2011/62 is for EU, FDASIA is for USA, Con-gress of USA (Title VII of the Food and Drug Administra-tion Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, 2012). In this act through so called \u201csections\u201d are described the ways to pro-tect the distributive chain and criminalize the falsification of medicines.Legislation in the Republic of MacedoniaIn R. Macedonia there is no specific law concerning falsification of medicines. The problem with falsification of medicines is covered partially by the Criminal Code of R.M., the Law of Medicines and Medical Devices and the Law of Customs measures and Intellectual Property Rights.ConclusionFalsification of medicinal products is a crime carried out using deception and other techniques typical of orga-nized crime and represents a public health problem and a problem of the trade competition as an intellectual prop-erty right infringement. An essential starting point in the fight against falsified medicines in R. Macedonia is the es-tablishment of an adequate national legal framework and regulatory system, based on the EU and USA legislation concerning this issue.
