legis-lation. Laws on Medicines in Macedonia and Serbia are harmonized with the EU regulation of medicines.Macedonia follows EU legislation for food supple-ments. The products are regulated by the special require-ments for safety of food supplements from 2012 (Official Gazzette of Republic of Serbia no. 45/10, 27/11; 50/12), and the Rulebook amending the Rulebook on special re-quirements for food supplements from 2013 and 2015 (Of-ficial Gazzette of Republic of Serbia, no. 41/13), and in compliance with the Croatian Rulebook on food supple-ments in terms of their classification from 2013. Serbia also follows EU legislation, but has not implemented and do not follow the Regulation on nutrition and health claims, novel food regulation procedures and the law on using symbols on packaging and packaging waste. For food supplements, indications and properties that are not possessed should not be attributed (Dzeparoski, 2013; Kotler, 1989; Kotler and Keler, 2009). The main goal of this paper was to make comparative analysis of advertising and promotion of the product Sen-tis by the company Bionika Pharmaceuticals in Macedonia and Serbia. The marketing campaigns, TV spots and inter-net advertisement have been analyzed. The choice of the countries is based upon different product categorization in which Sentis is classified.Materials and methodsComparative method for analyzing the regulation, ad-vertising and promotion of the food supplements and tradi-tional herbal medicines was used.Results and discussionCase studySentis is a natural sedative in the form of soft gela-tin capsules containing 200 mg of extract of valerian root (Valeriana Officinalis). In Macedonia Sentis is registered in 2012 as traditional herbal medicine (THM), while in Serbia is registered as a food supplement in 2013. Valeri-an root has been used since ancient times before the exis-tence of synthetic sedatives. The action is due to valeren-ic acid; experimental pharmacological studies have shown that it reduces motility, causing hypnotic activity, offset-ting the effect of caffeine and improves coordination. In both countries registered indications are temporary relieve of the symptoms of nervous tension, stress and insomnia. Benefits are unlike synthetic sedatives, it does not cause drowsiness and dependence (Bionika, 2013; PDR, 2007; WHO, 1999).The differences regarding dosing and indications, re-sulting from the different classification of the same prod-uct are as follows:- dosing registered as THM in Macedonia is 4 x 200 mg, while as food supplement in Serbia maximum daily dose is decreased to 2 x 200 mg;- -indications are the same in both countries, ex-cept that in Macedonia additionally is registered the sedative effect. S2 PP 75168Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 167 - 168 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsThese differences concern advertising and promotion-al activities. In Macedonia and Serbia same package in green and stylized cubist design of flowers and brain with minimal-istic look is used. The text on the package and the patient leaflets are different in accordance with the categoriza-tion, in correlation with the specific regulation. For THM it is written clearly that it is medicine without prescription, with specific 6 line content structure of the patient leaflet and indications based on traditional use. For the food sup-plement is clearly stated that the product is food supple-ment and also ingredients, nutrition and energetic values must be printed on the package, whereas the leaflet and claims are not obligatory. In Serbia the food supplement Sentis is sold with leaflet which contains claims.Internet is universal and powerful digital marketing tool in promotion of company products, including compa-ny web-sites. The content of websites also varies in differ-ent countries.Promotional materials are with similar text content and same design in both countries, except the statement that it is THM or food supplement. The other difference for the THM is also that \"the patient leaflet should be read, for more information you should consult your pharmacist or doctor\". The last is valid for all forms of advertisement. TV spot for Sentis as THM has been approved for ad-vertising in electronic media to the general public by the Ministry of Health. The message which should remain in the subconscious of the audience is that when you use Sen-tis the life will be without anxiety, stress, carefree, without worries and the consumer will continue on with life. TV spot for Sentis as food supplement in Serbia is from infor-mative character. It is not necessary approval for advertis-ing, because is based on generally accepted scientific data and they are comprehensible to the average consumer. In Serbia should be submitted for approval only health claims for reducing the risk of disease. The message which should remain in the subconscious of the audience is that it is a natural product for healthy people, which if used will help reduce certain symptoms. Except promoting the product, with both advertise-ments is also promoted the new pharmaceutical company. TV advertising in Macedonia with a strong and distinctive message, along with the promotion activities, helped the company to achieve significant market share in this seg-ment. Marketing of products by companies should be in accordance with the current country regulation for specif-ic product category.ConclusionThere are major differences in the marketing of THM/OTC and food supplements. All promotional materials for THM to the general public are subject to approval by reg-ulatory bodies, based on the approved summary of product characteristics and patient leaflet. The marketing of food supplements is more liberal in advertising and in Serbia is not subject to approval, if based on generally accepted sci-entific data. Macedonia follows the EU Regulation on nu-trition and health claims for food supplements. The results of the case study can also be used for preparation of mar-keting materials for other products on other markets of in-terest with similar regulation.

Trajkovska, Maja Ilijoska, Andrea Alagjozovska, Hristina Tomovska, Nada Stojanoska, Hristina Babunovska ALKALOID AD-Skopje, Pharmaceutical, Chemical and Cosmetics Company, Aleksandar Makedonski 12, Skopje, Macedonia* bbujarovska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionNear InfraRed - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) in recent years has gained much interest due to its simple maintenance and short measuring time. This technique differs from the conventional techniques such as HPLC and GC, because the essential component is the sampling interface. That allows for fast, non-destructive measurement of materials with little or no sample preparation. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is used for identification on every container that has been delivered. The principle is based on the comparison of the spectral data of the substance with the spectral data of several samples, which are present in a spectral reference library. These samples have positive chemical/physical and microbiological test analysis, tested in accordance with producer Certificate of Analysis and producer Drug Master File. Positive identification of these samples originally is confirmed with IR Spectrophotometry or other specific identification method. Besides others parameters, these analyses include testing of loss on drying, content of water, optical rotation, related substances and assay that may cause of variables in the NIR spectra. According to the \"Guideline on the use of NIR spectroscopy by the pharmaceutical industry and the data requirements for new submission and variations\" issued by the European Medicine Agency, when NIR procedures are used for qualitative analysis should be validated for a minimum specificity and robustness (EMA, 2009). For the specificity, independent set of samples is created of different batches, which are not included in the creating of the reference library. All of the samples should be approved correctly (pass). The reference library should be also challenged with relevant structural analogues, which should be rejected (fail). As for robustness, the effects of relevant variables should be understood, tested and documented. Some of the variables include: environmental temperature, humidity, different probe depth, different packaging material, changes in the instrumental method, for example the number of scans. Also instrumental variation can be consider, e.g. changing lamps or reflectance material.Materials and methodsThe NIRS analyses were performed on Thermo Antaris II FT-NIR Analyzer. It is dedicated FT-NIR analyzer designed specifically for use in the industrial environments of the pharmaceutical, food and beverages, chemical and polymer industries (Hirsch, 2008). Some of the characteristics of the instrument are: the detection is performed on high - sensitive, high - stable matched InGaAs; the light source is long - life, high intensity halogen NIR source; the interferometer is frictionless stable, long - life Michelson. The sampling method used is Fiber Optic. NIRS sampling by fiber optics allows rapid point-of-use QC for raw material identification. The Antaris II Fiber Optic module can be used with the SabIR hand - held diffuse reflectance probe which can analyze samples directly or indirectly through packaging materials. The spectral range of SabIR Probe is 12000 - 4000 cm-1. The probe shaft is made of stainless steel, and the window material of the shaft is made is made of high quality, chemical resistance sapphire according to the instrument specification (Antaris II FT-NIR Analyzer).The method that is used in Alkaloid is with SabIR Fiber Optic module. The spectral range in which the collecting is performed is 10000 - 4000 cm-1. The number of scans in 30, and the resolution is 8 cm-1.In the first step of creating the reference library, NIR S2 PP 76170Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 169 - 170 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsspectrum of Ibuprofen Lysine Reference standard was collected. Due to lack of certified reference standard from pharmacopoeia, in - house standard sent from the suitable manufacturer was used. Further the library was continually updated with samples of commercial batches of Ibuprofen lysine received from the manufacturer.The spectral reference library is composed of spectra collected with direct scanning of the substance and indirect scanning (through the polyethylene bag). In routine, indirect scanning is preferred, by reason of faster scanning and not requiring opening every package. The NIR method for identification of Ibuprofen lysine was validated in terms of Specificity and Robustness, according to the Guideline on the use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) by the pharmaceutical industry and the data requirement for the new submissions and variations, issued by the European Medicine Agency.Results and discussionVerification workflows are created for performance the following tests of specificity and robustness. These workflows are chosen for verification of the production workflow for Ibuprofen lysine.Verification workflow for performing specificityOne verification workflow that contains independent set of three samples, which are batches not included in the reference library are included is created. The results for these samples are PASS. The other verification workflow has three different substances that have similar structure with Ibuprofen Lysine, and therefore is expected to have similar NIR spectrum. That is Ibuprofen, the difference is with the Lysine group; Ketoprofen, belongs to the same group of Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; Paracetamol, together with Ketoprofen, they have similar structure. The result for Ibuprofen Lysine is PASS, and for the other three substances is FAIL.Verification workflow for robustnessRobustness is performed for testing the effect of minor changes to normal operating conditions on the analysis (Tang, 2012). Verification workflows are created for performance these tests. The parameters for validation robustness of the method, which can affect the method in our operating environment, are the following: change in the number of scans (performed only with indirectly scanning), change in probe depth (performed with direct scanning) and change in thickness of the packaging material (performed with indirect scanning). The results for these three workflow are PASS, which brings the conclusion that certain changes in the method does not affect the test results. ConclusionThe obtained results confirm that the NIR method for identification of Ibuprofen lysine is verified and appropriate for it use. ReferencesEuropean Medicines Agency, 2009.

Trajkovska, Hristina Babunovska Alkaloid AD - Skopje, Pharmaceutical, chemical and Cosmetics Company, Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* mspasevska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionResidual solvents in pharmaceuticals are defined as organic volatile chemicals that are used or produced in the manufacture of drug substances or excipients, or in the preparation of drug products. The solvents are not completely removed by the manufacturing techniques and therefore it is required appropriate selection of the solvent for the synthesis. The solvent used can enhance the yield, or even determine some of the characteristic of the substances, such as crystal form, purity and solubility (CHMP, 2015). Considering that residual solvents do not provide any therapeutically benefits, they should be removed, to the extent possible, to meet ingredient and product specifications and good manufacturing practices. The residual solvents, based on their toxicity, are divided into three groups. The solvents that are known to cause unacceptable toxicities are class 1. In this group belongs: benzene, carbon tetrachloride; 1,2-dichlorethane; 1,1 - dichlorethene and 1,1,1-trichlorethane. These solvents are proven human carcinogens and environmental hazardous. Considering the unacceptable toxicity, this class of solvents should be avoided during the manufacturing process, unless their use can be strongly justified in a risk-benefit assessment. The Class 2 solvents are associated with less severe toxicity. Some of the solvents that belong to this group are: acetonitrile; chloroform; 1,2-dichlorethene; N,N-dimethylacetamide; N,N-dimethylformamide; 1,4-dioxane; ethylene glycol; formamide; methanol; hexane; pyridine; toluene. The use of these solvents should be limited in order to protect the patients from potential adverse effects. Ideally, less toxic solvents should be used where is possible. Those are solvents that belong to Class 3. They are counted as less toxic and of lower risk to human health then Class 1 and Class 2 residual solvents. The solvents in this class are not known as a human health hazard at level normally accepted in pharmaceuticals. However there are no long-term toxicity or carcinogenicity studies for many of the residual solvents in Class 3. Available data so far, indicate that they are less toxic in acute or short term studies and negative in genotoxicity studies. Some of the solvents that belong to this group are: acetic acid; acetone; 1-butanol; 2-butanol; dimethyl sulfoxide; ethanol; ethyl acetate; ethyl ether; formic acid (USP, 2015).Residual solvent that was used in the synthesis of sodium citrate is methanol. Since methanol belongs to class 2 residual solvents, quantification should be performed. Materials and methodsThe experiments were performed on Shimadzu 2010 Plus GC instrument. The pressure was set to 9.8 Psi, column flow was 2.08 mL/min and total flow was 15.5 mL/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas. Other gases that were used are Hydrogen and Air.

Proper function-ing and performance of software and computer systems play a major role in obtaining consistency, reliability and accuracy of data. Therefore, computer system validation (CSV) should be part of any good development and manufacturing practice. It is also requested by EU and FDA regulations and guidelines through the overall requirement that \"equipment must be suit-able for its intended use\".Specific requirements for computers can be found in sec-tion 211.68 of the US cGMP regulations (USC, 2008). * Automatic, mechanical, or electronic equipment or other types of equipment, including computers, or related systems that will perform a function satis-factorily, may be used in the manufacture, process-ing, packing, and holding of a drug product. If such equipment is so used, it shall be routinely calibrat-ed, inspected, or checked according to a written pro-gram designed to assure proper performance. Writ-ten records of those calibration checks and inspec-tions shall be maintained. * Appropriate controls shall be exercised over comput-er or related systems to assure that changes in master production and control records or other records are instituted only by authorized personnel. * Input to and output from the computer or related system of formulas or other records or data shall be checked for accuracy. * The degree and frequency of input/output verifica-tion shall be based on the complexity and reliability of the computer or related system. * A backup file of data entered into the computer or re-lated system shall be maintained except where cer-tain data, such as calculations performed in connec-tion with laboratory analysis, are eliminated by com-puterization or other automated processes. In such instances a written record of the program shall be maintained along with appropriate validation data. * Hard copy or alternative systems, such as duplicates, tapes, or microfilm, shall be designed to assure that backup data are exact and complete and that it is se-cure from alteration, inadvertent erasures, or loss shall be maintained.Specific requirements for computers and electronic re-cords and signatures are also defined in FDA's regulations 21 CFR Part 11 on electronic Records and Signatures (USC, 1997).The Good Automated Manufacturing Practices Forum (GAMP) has developed guidelines for computer validation. All these guidelines and publications follow a couple of prin-ciples:* Validation of computer systems is not a onetime event. It starts with the definition of the product or project and setting user requirement specifications and cover the vendor selection process, installation, initial operation, going use, and change control and system retirement. * All publications refer to some kind of life cycle mod-el with a formal change control procedure being an important part of the whole process. * There are no detailed instructions on what should be tested. All guidelines refer to risk assessment for the extent of validation.Validation of computer systems is not a once off event. Annex 11 of the European GMP directive is very clear about this: Validation should be considered as part of the complete life cycle of a computer system. This cycle includes the stag-es of planning, specification, programming, testing, commis-sioning, documentation, operation, monitoring and modify-ing\" (EC, 2010).Scope The scope of this work is to present the validation of ERP SAP computer system used in Alkaloid AD Skopje known as AlkaSAP system.S2 PP 110238Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 237 - 238 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsBackgroundAlkaSAP system was implemented in Alkaloid AD Sko-pje in 2007. Within AlkaSAP there are several 'modules', each of which contains transactions in order to perform nec-essary tasks to complete business processes. Several of these tasks and processes are considered critical or have regulatory implications to Alkaloid. The SAP implemented modules in Alkaloid AD Skopje in 2007 were: 1. Sales & Distribution (SD)2. Production Planning (PP)3. Quality Management (QM)4. Materials Management (MM)5. Financial Accounting (FI)6. Controlling (CO)During 2014 additional SAP module concerning human capital management (HCM) was implemented. Validation of the AlkaSAPValidation of the AlkaSAP system was made in accor-dance with GAMP 4. All validation activities were defined in Validation Master Plan (VMP). The validation programme was divided into phases according to the validation life cy-cle. Each phase was divided into tasks and for every task there were actions, responsibilities and associated procedures. Specification / Design PhaseDuring this phase the following documents were created:Validation Master Plan (VMP); User Requirement Spec-ification (URS); Functional Specification (FS); Risk Assess-ment (RsA); Hardware Design Specification (HDS); Software Design Specification (SDS); Code Review (CR);Testing phaseBoth hardware and software elements were tested as part of the AlkaSAP implementation.Hardware Acceptance TestingHardware Acceptance Testing (including Infrastructure) was conducted successfully on all servers.Document reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP HATSSoftware Acceptance TestingAll bespoke and functional application software identi-fied in the Functional Specification or Software Design Speci-fication was tested against the Software Acceptance test Spec-ification.Document Reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP SATSSoftware Performance Test SpecificationAll software identified in the Functional Specification or Software Design Specification was given a risk priority and was tested against the Software Performance Test Specifica-tion:Document Reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP SPTSIn accordance with risk priority given in the Risk Assess-ment tests were executed as Detailed Functional Tests; User Acceptance Tests; Business ScenariosValidation ReportThe Validation Report has been issued as a phased report for the purpose of 'go-live' for the AlkaSAP and summarizes the validation programme activities.Document Reference: CSV VMR AlkaSAPOngoing Operation and EvaluationIn order to control and maintain the validation status of the AlkaSAP system, the following procedures are established and written:Policies and Procedures for Security and Access to serv-ersPolicies and Procedures for Back Up, Restore and Ar-chiveProcedures for Training and Operating of the systemPeriodic reviewPeriodic Reviews of the System is covered by Alkaloid Guideline ensuring SOPs, validation documentation and re-cords are audited on a regular basis to evaluate the effective-ness of controlling procedures.SummaryAlkaloid AD Skopje started 'go-live' with the validated AlkaSAP computer system. The validation test results were of sufficient detail and quality to establish that this computer sys-tem does what it purports to do. AlkaSAP still remains status of \"validated system\" which can be proved with regular periodic review of the system.ReferencesAlkaSAP Validation Master Plan version 2.0, 21st November 2006.European Commission (EC), 2010.

There are 400 - 500 compounds that have been identified in its extracts, and among them approximately 70 are C21 terpenophenols, members of a group known as cannabinoids, specific for this plant (ElSohly and Slade, 2005; Fischedick, et al., 2009; Turn-er, et al., 1980). The constituent of Cannabis sativa L., D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9THC), is the primary psychoac-tive cannabinoid. Given that the main pharmacological and psychoactive effects have been attributed to this com-pound, the most of the studies have been focused on its ef-fects (Costa, 2007). The effects of Cannabis sativa L. are not solely due to 9THC because cannabidiol (CBD) was found to cause pharmacological effects (Russo and Guy, 2006). It was shown that CBD and other cannabinoids achieve synergy with 9THC causing potentiation of ben-efits, antagonism of adverse effects, summation, pharma-cokinetic advantages, and metabolism (Russo and Guy, 2006). Many countries became more liberal towards medici-nal use of Cannabis sativa L. (Baker et al., 2003). Recent-ly there has been an increasing interest in development of cannabinoids and Cannabis sativa L. preparations as legiti-mate medicines for a variety of medical applications. Some of them include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, glaucoma, asthma and cardiovascular condi-tions, and as an antiemetic (Williamson and Evans, 2000). Cannabidoids are very potent compounds and their control in Cannabis sativa L. preparations is very important, espe-cially because their potential users are patients which al-ready have serious health problems. The aim of this study was to apply our in-house HPLC/DAD method on the Cannabis sativa L. preparations pres-ent in the European market and to control their quality.Materials and methodsThe samples of Cannabis sativa L. preparations were purchased from the European market, produced by Endoca (Pharmaceutical Company, Denmark). The standard sub-stances were obtained from Lipomed AG (Switzerland). The samples of standard substances were: 9-THC (3-pen-tyl-6,6,9-trimethyl-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-dibenzo(b,d)pyran-1-ol), delivered as 1 mL ampule solution (5 mg/ mL prepared in ethanol, with purity 98.52%, m/m) and CBD ((-)-trans-2-p-mentha-1,8-dien-3-yl-5-pentylresorcinol) as the solid substance (99.73%, m/m). The solvents used dur-ing the analysis were with HPLC grade. For the chromatographic analysis Agilent Technolo-gies HPLC system 1200 series (Germany) was used. The analysis was performed on HPLC-column: Purospher(r) Star RP18e (150 mm x 4.6 mm ID, 5 um) from Merck KGaA (Germany) using mobile phase composed of ace-tonitrile and water in gradient mode with acetonitrile from 50%, V/V, to 80%, V/V, at flow rate 1.5 mL/min, tempera-ture 30 degC, detection at 220 nm, injection 10 uL, in 31 min run time. The working solutions of standard substance CBD were prepared in methanol in two concentration ranges: S2 PP 111240Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 239 - 240 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentations95.48 ug/mL - 286.43 ug/mL and 103.13 ug/mL - 309.40 ug/mL. The 9THC working solutions were prepared in methanol in concentration range: 9.81 ug/mL - 19.63 ug/mL. The sample solutions were prepared by liquid/liquid extraction technique using a mixture of methanol and chlo-roform (9:1). When the layers were clearly separated, the sample from the methanolic layer was applied in HPLC/DAD system. Results and discussionFive different Cannabis sativa L. preparations pur-chased from the European market were analyzed. All were prepared from hemp oil with various amounts of CBD as active compound and naturally contains 9-THC, as an im-purity. According to the certificates the amount of CBD was: 3%; 5%; 10 %; 15% and 30%, m/m, and expected im-purity as 9THC was limited at maximum of 0.20%, m/m.For preparation of the samples we used the recom-mended United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime meth-od (UNODC Manual, 2009). For identification and quan-tification of cannabinoids we used our in-house chromato-graphic gradient method which we have proposed for hemp seed oil analysis (Shishovska et al., 2014) because of the similarity of samples in origin and form. In the analyzed samples of hemp oil preparations can-nabidiol and 9THC were identified and quantified. Iden-tifications were done by comparing of the retention times and UV spectra of standard compounds with retention times of peaks at the chromatograms of samples and their UV spectra. The retention times of CBD and 9THC peaks were 15.9 min and 21.0 min, respectively.For the quantification, data obtained from the chro-matograms were calculated using the method of the cal-ibration curve (constructed as concentration, c (ug/ml), versus peak area, A (mAU)). The analyzed working solu-tions of the active compound CBD and the trace compound 9THC showed high linearity in the working ranges. The estimated coefficient of the linearity for CBD working so-lutions at concentration range: 95.48 ug/mL - 286.43 ug/mL was 1.000 (A = 23688 c + 16.188); while for the CBD working solutions at concentration range: 103.13 ug/mL - 309.40 ug/mL it was 0.9998 (A = 39613 c + 31.129), and for the working solutions of standard substance 9THC at concentration range: 9.81 ug/mL - 19.63 ug/mL it was 0.9997 (A = 25269 c - 7.0738).It was found that content of cannabidiol in analyzed samples is from 109.7% to 125.4%, m/m of the declared values. The assays of 9THC traces at the samples vary according the concentration of the active compound. As quantities of CBD at samples were lower (3 - 5%), the as-say of 9THC is under the allowed maximum limit (0.02% - 0.14%), but at samples with higher concentrations of CBD (10 - 30%) the 9THC traces are above the allowed maximum limit (0.45% - 1.14%).ConclusionThe satisfactory chromatographic data proved that our in-house gradient HPLC/DAD method can be successful-ly used for determination of the active substance CBD and traces of 9THC in Cannabis sativa L. preparations. The results obtained for the analyzed samples of Cannabis sati-va L. preparations showed higher amounts of CBD than de-clared value in the certificate (differences range from 9.7% m/m to 25.4%, m/m). In two samples, the amount of 9THC found was under allowed maximum limit of 0.20%, while in three samples the amount was above that value."}, "meta": {}, "created_at": "2024-04-08T17:42:22.016659Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-08T17:54:36.416454Z", "inner_id": 7, "total_annotations": 1, "cancelled_annotations": 0, "total_predictions": 0, "comment_count": 0, "unresolved_comment_count": 0, "last_comment_updated_at": null, "project": 60364, "updated_by": 19044, "comment_authors": []}]
