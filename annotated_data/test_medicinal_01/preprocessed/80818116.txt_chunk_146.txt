In suspected cas-es of pericarditis, echocardiography should be done first so that Chiara's effusion pericardial highlights.Aim of this paper is to verify and document the im-pact of terminal chronic kidney insufficiency and the im-pact from HD on the onset of pericarditis and its complica-tions. Etiology of different types of pericarditis in patients with different diseases (cardiovascular, respiratory, infec-tious etc.) have been studied thoroughly except for man-ifestations and etiology of pericarditis in uremic patients treated with HD where not enough studies have been made therefore its etiology is still not definitely known. There-fore more and larger studies need to be made with more patients so the exact cause of this phenomenon with le-thal consequences in uremic patients treated with HD can be found. Materials and methodsIn this clinical prospective observational study were analyzed 90 patients with terminal chronic kid-ney insufficiency treated with HD in Clinical Hospital of Tetovo on Department of Nephrology with mean age 62.40+-5.20 identical for both genders. Initial evaluation in-cludes a clinical history and physical examination, ECG, echocardiography(3D color Doppler) chest radiography, and lab studies.ECG can be diagnostic in acute pericardi-tis and typically shows ST elevation in all leads. The ratio of the amplitude of ST segment to the amplitude of the T wave in leads I, V4, V5, and V6 on electrocardiogram can be used to differentiate acute pericarditis (AP) from ear-ly repolarization (ER) and early repolarization of left ven-tricular hypertrophy (ERLVH), according to a recent study. Statistical elaborationThe basic statistical methods used in this study were: arithmetical average value, standard deviation X+-SD, Stu-dent "t" test, Mann Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test. The sta-tistical significance of the differences between subjects of the experimented group and control group for the gained parameters was analyzed with "Anova Two Factor " with statistical value for ,,p" smallearthen 1% ( p<0.0001).Results and discussionFrom 90 patients treated with HD, 30 patients (10 females, 20 males) showed symptoms of chest pain and tightening similar to pectoral angina (in small number of patients persistent temperature accompanied with fever was found). All patients who presented with symptoms of uremic pericarditis had fluid overload (between HD inter-vals) of 4000-6000ml.ConclusionIn our work we verified that in 30% of examined pa-tients predominate symptoms of uremic pericarditis, from those: in 25% pericarditis was caused as inadequate HD treatment, fluid overload between HD intervals, dietetic-hygienic disrespect of HD, termination of HD seance be-fore required, disuse of antihypertensive and diuretic ther-apy (in 10% of patients with two weekly sessions of HD from 4 to 5 hours per seance), while in 5% of patients peri-carditis was consequence of various infections. The hemo-dialysis patients also used the supp. Indomethacin, aspirin, corticotherapy and broad spectrum antibiotic. ReferencesBright, R.,1836.

One of the risk indicators of cardiovascu-lar factors considering this group of patients is Arterial hy-pertension (AH). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibi-tors (ACE) are the most effective group of drugs used for the treatment of hypertension in patients with CRI (Brown et al., 1998) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), based on the prevention of renal and CVD damages. ACE in-hibitors are used primarily for the aforementioned diseas-es due to their effectiveness in slowing down the pace of progress and reducing the rate of morbidity and mortali-ty in patients with these diseases. A large number of stud-ies have been published where they show the positive ef-fects of ACE inhibitors. These drugs remain further as the most preferred drugs in the treatment of patients with CRI and AH. AH and lipid abnormalities are among the most important causes that accelerate the progression of chron-ic renal disease (CRD) and the risk of CVD. The etiology of arterial hypertension is a multifactorial (near 20-25% of cases with AH the etiology is known, while other cases are due to many other disorders: hormonal, renal, cardiac, in-fectious, congenital diseases or inherited, different urop-struksionet, RVU (Reflux Vesico Uretral) etc. AH remains one most important and common factor of diseases throughout the world. Between normotension and hypetension pressure not any precise definition per-sists, but based on the preferences and the World Health Organization all the values of systolic pressure higher than 140 mmHg and diastolic higher than 90 mmHg are treated as arterial hypertension. Recent years, a number of studies have verified and documented that between AH and lipid abnormalities and progress of CKD (Chronic Kidney Dis-ease) there is a high positive correlation. There are facts documented that patients with CKD and other consequenc-es besides AH, a large number of them suffer from a hip-ertregliceridemia and dyslipidemia, so it is very necessary examination, treatment, determination and correlation of lipids with AH, that in the initial stages of CRD with the sole purpose of preventing rapid pace of progress towards CRD uremia. Many contemporary studies testify a close connection between pressure and uremic dyslipidemia ver-ifying that the AH with its oscillations significantly af-fect lipid disorder helping their stratification on the wall of blood vessels, thus increasing the risk of aterogenesis of coronary arteries, cerbrale with frequent manifestations of acute myocardial infarction. Materials and methodsIn the study 240 subjects were included (of which 140 male and 100 female respectively. The average age was 56.80 +- 12.50 years. The first group of 120 patients (50 fe-male and 70 male) were treated over 12 months with the ACE inhibitor and the second group (50 female and 70 male) were treated with Angiotensin II AT1 receptor block-ers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The patients were examined before and after the study. The examina-tion was carried out for the analysis of proteinuria, serum urea, serum creatinine, uric acid electrolytes, profile of lip-id and determination of the level of glomerular filtration S6 PP 284594Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 593 - 594 (2016)Clinical pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular sciencesPoster presentationsrate (GFR glomerular filtration Rate by Cockroft & Gault formula) before and after the therapy. The method used is standard deviation +- SD, two factor ANOVA.Results and discussionFrom the results obtained the blood pressure of the pa-tients was lower in both treated groups, though statistical-ly not significant. When comparing the groups treated with ACE inhibitors and the group treated with different group of medicines respectively there was statistically signifi-cant difference <0.005 for the concentrations of urea, cre-atinine, uric acid and with a stagnation of GFR in favor of the group that was treated with ACE inhibitors for over 12 months.ConclusionMany contemporary studies testify a close connection between pressure and uremic dyslipidemia verifying that the AH with its oscillations significantly affect lipid dis-order helping their stratification on the wall of blood ves-sels, thus increasing the risk of aterogenesis of coronary arteries, cerebral with frequent manifestations of acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, angi-na pectoris, heart failure congestive and cerebrovascular brain stroke (Antony et al., 1996). Common effects of AH and hyperlipidemia manifestly affect modification and re-duce in renal functions causing nefroangiosklerosis with glomerulosclerosis. It is estimated that 10-13% of elderly patients in the US suffer from CKD and AH without taking to account the degree of CRD. AH during CRF is volumic type (with manifestations of cardiovascular complications with hypertensive cardiomyopathy etc. and despite that sometimes it may be as a result of other mechanisms like hipernatremia etc. Although more research needs to be car-ried out, our results suggest that ACE inhibitors, regardless of their antihypertensive effects, can reduce and slow down significantly the rate of chronic renal failure and cardiovas-cular diseases (Weiner et al., 2007). Inadequate treatment of HTA in patients with CRI symptoms will lead to risk of CVD and an increase in renal diseases. ReferencesAntony, I., Lerebours, G., Nitenberg, A., 1996.

In this study we wanted to display the apolipoproteinic abnor-malities in patients with RA, their correlation and how RA causes changes of apolipoproteinic profile. RA is system-ic disease of connective tissue (Boers et al., 2003; Dessein et al., 2006; Park et al., 1999; Gonzalez-Gay et al., 2005) with unknown ethiology, subacute or chronic with exacer-bations and remissions, most commonly found in peryphe-rial joints, symetrically, which with time can cause destruc-tion, deformities and at the end ankylosis of joints. It is known fact that patients with RA are more prone to differ-ent inflamations which is confirmed from the fact that these patients have higher concentrations of C-Reactive Prote-ine, a biomarker who suggest the presence of inflamma-tion who when is combined with apolipoproteinic abnor-malities is count as additional factor on the onset of athero-sclerotic changes of coronary and cerebrovascular arteries, with early onset of atherosclerosis in patients with RA. Aim of studyPrimary aim of this study is to show apolipoprotein-ic abnormalities and the concentrations of CPR in patients with RA, and their role on the progress of RA and their ath-erogenic effect on coronary, cerebrovacular and peripheri-al artheries. Matherial and methods In this cross-section study a total of 40 patients were included, from whom 24 were females with mean age of 48.0+-18.6 and 16 males with mean age of 49.5+-12.8, with verified diagnosis of RA according to criteria of Ameri-can Association for Rheumatoid Arthritis of 1987. Control group was composed from 40 healthy individuals (voulen-tary blood donors) from whom 24 females and 16 males. In all patients (examined group and control group) beside routine analysis for lipid profile other analysis were made as well: total lipids (TL), total cholesterol (TCh), triglyc-erides (TG), HDL-ch,LDL-ch,ApolipoproteinA-1,Apo-B100, Apo-E, Lp(a)CRO and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) lev-els too.Results and discussionOur study confirmed that patients with RA are prone to have increased levels of: TL=8.20+-2.70mmol/l;TCh=6.8+-2.70mmol/l;TG=3.46+-0.65 mmol/l; and LDL-ch=4.48+-0.90 mmol/l whereas HDL levels were de-creaed HDL-ch= 0.94 +- 0.60 mmol/l. From analysis of apolipoproteins we found low concentrations of Apo-A1=0.94+-0.12 g/l and high concentrations of ApoB100= 2.98+-1.85 g/l; Apo-E=6.50+-1.70 g/l , Lp(a)=48.0+-18.60, and CRP=18.0+- 6.80 mg/l in contranst from the control group results: TL= 6.20+-0.50 mmol/l; TCh =4,30+-0.60 mmol/l; TG=1.24+-0.70 mmol/l; HDL-ch= 1.28+-0.40 and LDL-ch=2.90+-0.90 mmol/l, and CRP= 4 mg/l. Lipopro-tein lipase levels in patients with RA in our study showed low levels:LPL-12.80+-4.20 u/L comparing with the control group LPL- 24.80+-12.00 u/L. Decreased activity of LPL is believed to be result of increased concentrations of cyto-S6 PP 285596Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 595 - 596 (2016)Clinical pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular sciencesPoster presentationscines: Interleukin 1, Interleukin 1b, Interleukin 1a, Inter-leukin 2,Interleukin 6, Interleukin 8, Interleukin 10, Inter-leukin 12 and Tumor Necrosis Factor. Disturbed apolipo-proteinic profile, proinflamatory cytokines and increased levels of CRP are fact that patients with RA are prone to increased risk for atherosclerotic changes in blood ves-sels, with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, cere-brovascular events, peripheric artherial disease and onset of early (premature) atheros-clerosis (atherosclerosis prae-cox). ConclusionIt can be concluded that measuring lipidic and apoli-poproteinic abnormalities in RA patients can help to take hygienic-dietetic measures as well as treatment methods which significantly would decrease prevalence of dyslip-idemia and would also slow down the atherogenesis which would reduce in minimum the onset of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, atherosclerotic macroarteriopathy and early atherosclerosis in patients with RA. Management of lipid abnormalities in patients with RA aims to normalize the atherogenic index (TCh/HDLch) with statines, fibrates, nyacine, cholestipol, cholestyramine or combined therapy, also prevention of inflamatory processes.ReferencesBoers, M., Nurmohamed, M.T., Doelman, C.J.A., Lard, L.R., Verhoeven, A.C., Voskuyl, A.E., Huizinga, T.W., van de Stadt, R.J., Dijkmans, B.A., van der Linden, S., 2003.
