Cyril and Methodius", Mother Theresa 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* j_klopcevska@yahoo.comIntroductionThe pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) which belongs to the genus Capsicum is a widely cultivated and distribut-ed vegetable crop (Huq and Arshad, 2010). It is consist-ed of carbohydrates, proteins, carboxylic acids, miner-als, vitamins, and other biologically active compounds. The green, yellow, orange, and red pepper colour is de-pendent on a carotenoid pigment profile. Capsaicin as the main capsaicinoid compound determined the pungency in the red hot pepper (Kumar et al., 2011). Although the pep-per is produced seasonally, it is consumed throughout the year in either various specialties or spices and oleoresin extracts (Huq and Arshad, 2010; Kumar et al., 2011). The pepper is not only popular spice, but it could also be used in plant based insecticide formulations (Huq and Arshad, 2010). The Capsicum annuum L. could be differed from shape, pungency level, colour, and content of biochemi-cal compound. The colour could be evaluated from sur-face and extractable colour aspects (Malacara, 2011). The red colour intensity is considered as the main quality attri-bute of the red pepper and oleoresins, since it influences on both consumer acceptance and commercial value. The surface colour is dependent on pepper species and condi-tions during growing, storage, and processing (Belovic et al., 2014). Many factors affect pepper colour loss such as photolytic and thermal conditions, as well as the oxidative degradation of carotenoid pigments (Belovic et al., 2014). Several different methods for the pepper colour evaluation, based on the surface colour measurement and profiling of the carotenoids are reported in the literature (Belovic et al., 2014). Surface colour measuring is the method for de-scribing colour changes closest to sensory visual percep-tion (Malacara, 2011). In this work the influence of the par-ticle size at extraction of pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk of red hot pepper of Macedonian origin was studied by the determination of the extract yield and surface CIE Lab co-lour values. Materials and methodsThe red hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L., spp. mi-crocarpum longum conoides, convar. Horgoshka) was grown in the locality Markova Cheshma, Prilep, Republic of Macedonia. Dried fruits of the red hot pepper were cut manually longitudinally with a knife. Pericarp was separat-ed from the seed, placenta, and stalk. Analytical grade pe-troleum ether (40-60 degC) was supplied from Merck (Ger-many). An analytical balance Mettler Toledo (Switzerland) was used for the sample weighing with 0.1 mg accuracy. The samples were ground using a Retsch ZM1 mill (Ger-many). The extraction of the red hot pepper (10 g +- 0.1 mg) was carried out with Soxhlet procedure using petro-leum ether (40-60 degC). After 420 min extraction, the sol-vent was removed at 40 degC, 200 mPa using a rotary evap-orator (Devarot Elektromedicina, Slovenia). The steps of S4 PP 187396Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 395 - 396 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsdrying, cooling, and weighing were repeated until the dif-ference between two consecutive weights was smaller than 2 mg. The yield of the extract was calculated based on the dry matter weight of the red hot pepper sample used. The extraction procedure was performed in duplicate under the same operating conditions. Visual colour of the samples investigated was evaluated measuring the CIE Lab coor-dinates L* (lightness-darkness), a* (red-green), b* (yel-low-blue), chroma (C), and Hue (hdeg) using Dr. LANGE spectra colorimeter (Chelmsford, UK). Colour difference (DE) was calculated from a*, b*, and L* parameters, using Hunter-Scotfield's equation (Ergunes and Tarhan, 2006). Results and discussionAt extraction with petroleum ether (40-60 degC), 6.42% extract yield was obtained from pericarp with 0.25 mm particle size. Increasing the pericarp particle size from 0.5 to 1 mm, the extract quantity decreased, from 4.60 to 2.68%, respectively. The extract yield from red hot pep-per placenta with 0.5 mm particle size was 7.05%. The dif-ference in the extract quantity obtained from the placenta with 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm particle size was 1.49%. At seed extraction, the highest quantity of the extract was obtained in comparison to pericarp, placenta, and stalk. The highest extract yield of 22.32% was determined at seed extraction with 0.5 mm particle size. The obtained stalk extract quan-tity was the lowest, 3.70, 2.98, and 1.98% with particles size of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mm, respectively. The empirical models tested showed a good agreement between experi-mental and calculated data for the extract yield (R2> 0.90). The values of colour parameters varied between the sam-ples of pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk of red hot pepper. According to the L* values, seed samples were character-ized by the brightest (72.28), while pericarp samples by the darkest colour (54.26). The determined values of the co-lour parameter L* for placenta and seed were close to each other (65.59). High values of redness, a* (32.11) and satu-ration, C (41.94) were measured for the pericarp samples. The estimated value of a*/b* ratio in seed was the low-est. Hue (hdeg) values were linear correlated (R2 = 0.9793) with the values for the ratio of red (a*) and yellow colour (b*). The values of the L*, a*, b*, and C decreased with increasing the sample particle size (p< 0.05). The sample with 0.25 mm particle size was whiter, vivid, and deep red in colour than samples with particle size of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm. The highest colour difference before and after extrac-tion with petroleum ether (40-60 degC) was determined for the pericarp with 0.25 mm particle size (DE = 27.12). In-creasing the particle size from 0.5 to 1.0 mm, DE for peri-carp was decreased from 22.72 to 14.78. The influence of the particle size during extraction of placenta is insignifi-cant. For placenta with 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm particle size, estimated DE values were 19.28 and 18.67, respectively. The lowest DE values were determined during stalk extrac-tion. The values of colour parameters for obtained extracts from pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk at extraction with petroleum ether (40-60 degC) correlated with the determined colour values of the samples before and after extraction. The colour of red pepper is controlled by carotenoids. Cap-santhin, capsorubin, and xanthophylls are responsible for the red, while b-carotene and zeaxanthin for the yellow-orange colour. The red colour of different spices of pep-per is mainly due to the biosynthesis of keto-carotenoids such as capsanthin and capsorubin (Ergunes and Tarhan, 2006). The published data for the surface colour were relat-ed to the pericarp as an edible part of the pepper fruits. The differences in the pepper varieties, the maturity degree of the pepper, as well as the influence of drying and process-ing conditions were studied using characteristics of the sur-face colour (Belovic et al., 2014; Zaki et al., 2013). Results for the visual colour samples of pericarp are in agreement with those reported in the literature (Belovic et al., 2014; Ergunes and Tarhan, 2006; Zaki et al., 2013).ConclusionThe extraction of pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk of red hot pepper was carried out with petroleum ether (40-60 degC). The bigger particle size enabled to obtain less extract yield. The highest quantities were extracted from seed, while the lowest quantities from stalk. The colour differ-ences increased with decreasing the particle size. The high-est colour differences were estimated at extraction of peri-carp.

The most com-mon known essential oils are those from lemongrass, oreg-ano, peppermint, rosemary, thyme, cinnamon, and clove. A variety of volatile compounds such as terpenoids, phe-nol-derived aromatic and aliphatic compounds were deter-mined in the essential oil composition. The essential oils are recognized for their medicinal value such as analge-sic, sedative, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, and locally anaesthetic remedies. As a powerful natural products with bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, antiparasitical, and in-secticidal properties, the essential oils take a significant place in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industry, as well as in agriculture (Husnu Can Baser and Buchbauer, 2010). Concerning the complex chemical composition, the essential oils could be easily decomposed. Oxidative and photolytic conditions resulted in a quality loss and reduc-ing of the biological activity (Bilia et al., 2014). In order to protect and to use in drug delivery systems, nanoencap-sulation of the essential oils was proposed due to their ca-pability of improving the solubility, stability, and effica-cy of essential oil-based formulation. Nanoemulsion is dis-persion of two immiscible liquids with droplet size ranging from 20 to 200 nm (Sole and Solans, 2013). Low and high energy methods are used in the development of nanoemul-sion formulation. The high energy method required the me-chanical energy such as an ultrasonic procedure and a high pressure homogenization. On the other hand, surfactants as emulsifiers either in aqueous phase titration or in sponta-neous emulsification low energy method are used (Schuh et al., 2014).The objective of this study was to develop stable nano-emulsions of wild oregano essential oil using low energy emulsification methods.Materials and methodsSurfactants: Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan mo-nooleate, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), Tween 20 (polyoxy-ethylene sorbitan monolaurate, Merck, Germany), and Span 80 (sorbitan monooleate, Fluka, Germany) were used. Propylene glycol (PG) was supplied from Aldrich (Germany). Wild oregano essential oil (Origanum minu-tiflorum) produced in Turkey was purchased from Inter Connection Group DOOEL (Republic of Macedonia). Mil-liQ PURElab Classic system (ELGA, USA) supplied ultra-pure water.. An analytical balance Mettler Toledo (Switzer-land) was used for the sample weighing with 0.1 mg accu-racy. A magnetic stirrer (type MM-530 Tehnika Zelezniki, Slovenia) and a vortex (EV-102 Tehnika Zelezniki, Slove-nia) were used in the preparation of the wild oregano na-S4 PP 188398Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 397 - 398 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsnoemulsion formulations. Pseudo ternary phase diagrams consisting of wild oregano essential oil, mix of surfactans Tween 20, Tween 80 and Span 80 (Smix), and water were constructed using aqueous titration method (Shaaban and Edris, 2015). In glass vials, the wild oregano essential oil was mixed with Smix in weight ratios from 1:9 w/w to 9:1 w/w and was titrated with calculated amount of aque-ous phase (water or water and PG in the ratio 1:1 w/w). After 24 h the samples were monitored, visually inspect-ed for transparency and followability and water was add-ed. The phases were identified as transparent/translucent emulsion, transparent gel, turbid gel or turbid/milky emul-sion. The visually evaluated mixtures and nanoemulsion phase were marked on the phase diagram.
