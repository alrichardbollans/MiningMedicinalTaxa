Interestingly, both ABCA1 andABCG1 proteins seem to be tightly regulated by PPARg asshown in studies using full agonists of PPARg (Chawla et al.,2001; Ozasa et al., 2011). Falcarindiol, in contrast, works asa partial PPARg agonist in HEK-293 cells (Atanasov et al.,2013). Thus, the fact that the abundance of ABCG1 proteindid not significantly increase in response to falcarindiol mightbe explained by the partial agonism of the compound. Thecontribution of PPARg to falcarindiol-induced ABCA1 proteinexpression was demonstrated by co-treatment experiment withBADGE, a PPARg antagonist (Figure 3).

Falcarindiol Promotes Cholesterol EffluxFIGURE 5 | Effect of specific inhibitors of the proteasome (A) calpain (B), and lysosomal (C) protein degradation pathways on ABCA1 protein level in the presence orabsence of falcarindiol. Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were pre-treated with or without falcarindiol (Fal) at 10 uM for 24 h and incubated for another 3 h with theproteasome inhibitor lactacystin (Lact) at 10 uM (A), the calpain inhibitor calpeptin (Calp) at 30 ug/mL (B), or the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (Chlq) at 100 uM (C).Cells were lysed and protein was resolved via SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was used to monitor ABCA1 protein level under the indicated treatment conditions.All data are mean +- SD (n = 4) and vs. solvent vehicle control (DMSO): *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001, n.s. not significant (one-way ANOVA/Bonferroni).FIGURE 6 | Falcarindiol inhibits several lysosomal cathepsins. (A-E) Differentiated THP-1 macrophages were incubated for 24 h with or without falcarindiol (10 uM).Cells were lysed and cathepsin activity (S, B, L, K, and D) was determined by fluorescence measurements. Irreversible inhibitors of cathepsin B, S, L, and K(Z-FF-FMK; 1 uM) and cathepsin D (pepstatin A; 10 uM) were used as positive controls and directly added to the control lysates. All data are mean +- SD (n = 3) andvs. solvent vehicle control (DMSO): *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, n.s. not significant (one way-ANOVA/Bonferroni).suggest a synergistic effect between ABCA1 and ABCG1 in thecontext of cholesterol efflux (Gelissen et al., 2006; Hsieh et al.,2014). Although they exhibited a similar degradation rate inCHO cells, ABCG1 degradation seems to work by differentdegradation mechanisms than that of ABCA1. In addition, thereare differences in the protein stability of two ABCG1 isoforms(Gelissen et al., 2010).We also demonstrate that falcarindiol inhibits proteindegradation of ABCA1 in the presence of cycloheximide, a denovo protein synthesis inhibitor (Figure 4). Several proteolyticFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 596316Wang et al. Falcarindiol Promotes Cholesterol Effluxpathways have been described to mediate ABCA1 degradationin different cell types, particularly the calpain-, lysosome-, andproteasome-mediated pathways (Wang et al., 2003; Mizuno et al.,2011; Liu and Tang, 2012; Yokoyama et al., 2012). Applyingspecific inhibitors of these three proteolytic pathways, we foundthat falcarindiol mimics the effect of lysosomal proteolysisinhibitor chloroquine on ABCA1 levels (Figure 5).Cathepsins are well-established lysosomal proteases (Turket al., 2012). A variety of cathepsins (e.g., cathepsin B, D,K, L, S) are known to be expressed and to serve importantregulatory functions in macrophages (Punturieri et al., 2000;Beers et al., 2003; Bracke et al., 2005; Vasiljeva et al.,2006). Measuring the activity of lysosomal cathepsins knownto be expressed in macrophages revealed that falcarindiolsimultaneously suppresses the activity of cathepsin B, S, and K.Among these three cathepsins, cathepsin S and K were proposedto reduce cholesterol efflux from macrophages (Lindstedt et al.,2003; Lutgens et al., 2007) and knockout of cathepsin S or K geneswas shown to lead to decreased atherosclerosis in mice (Sukhovaet al., 2003; Lutgens et al., 2006). Cathepsin B was also found tobe highly expressed and active in murine atherosclerotic lesions(Chen et al., 2002; Lutgens et al., 2007). The potential of cathepsinB, S, and K to influence ABCA1 protein level regulation furthersupports the concept for their implication in atherosclerosis.To the best of our knowledge, interference of falcarindiol withcathepsins or with lysosomal function was never reported before.In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time thatfalcarindiol is able to increase macrophage cholesterol efflux.Falcarindiol upregulates ABCA1 protein level by promoting itsPPARg-driven gene expression and by extending its protein half-life. Moreover, our findings reveal the inhibition of lysosomalproteases as a new possiblemechanism of action of this importantdietary constituent. These data advance our knowledge forthe molecular mechanisms, by which small molecules regulatemacrophage cholesterol efflux, and might have implication forthe development of novel therapeutics or dietary supplements forthe prevention or treatment of CVD.CONCLUSIONIn the present study, we demonstrated that falcarindiol enhancescholesterol efflux and increases ABCA1 protein level by twocomplementary mechanisms, i.e., promoting ABCA1 geneexpression and inhibiting ABCA1 protein degradation.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSLW: Performed most of the experiments, analyzed the results,and drafted the manuscript.
