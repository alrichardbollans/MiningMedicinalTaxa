There were also claims on other fat values in the blood, the circulation, the vascular system and blood clotting, homocysteine metabolism, as well as general cardiovascular health. For example, cholesterol control claims are used on pectin in natural berries, and cholesterol reduction claims on blackcurrant seed oil combined with vitamin E, soluble plant and berry fi bre, and linolenic acid in sea buckthorn berries.1219 Blood pressure claims were made on sodium in natural berries1220. General cardiovascular claims were made on sea buckthorn berry oil, hawthorn, and blackcurrant seed oil combined with vitamin E1221.1214 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 10.1215 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 10.1216 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 10.1217 PASSCLAIM was a European Commission Concerted Action Programme in the years 2001-2005 carried out by the International Life Science Institute (ILSI) Europe. The fi nal reports of the project are available at Passclaim website http://europe.ilsi.org/activities/ecprojects/PASSCLAIM/. 1218 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland, page 10.1219 There are basically two types of cholesterol claims: claims which refer to the control of cholesterol and claims which refer to the reduction of cholesterol or the LDL/HDL ratio. Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 11-12.1220 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 13.1221 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 13-14.-219-Many claims were also linked to carbohydrate metabolism and weight control, gut health and immunity, and general immunity. Claims on carbohydrate metabolism and/or insulin sensitivity were made for example on soluble plant and berry fi bre. Gut health claims were made on sea buckthorn berry oil, fruit and berry juice fi bre, and natural berry fi bre.1222 Claims on general immunity were made on blackcurrant seed oil and sea buckthorn berry oil1223.Other important claim categories were claims related to the musculoskeletal system and mental health, and claims related to antioxidation. Other claims were on physical performance, oral and dental health, skin, hair and nail health, and eye health. Claims related to antioxidation were presented as only one factor among other principal claims. For example, a claim linked to cardiovascular health may be made, and in addition it is stated that the substance in question is also an antioxidant. Antioxidant claims were made on berry and fruit juices, berry seed oils, bilberry, forest bilberry, cranberry extract, fl avonoids extracted from sea buckthorn oil and sea buckthorn berry, and phenolic compounds of cranberry and lingonberry.1224When deciding the claims to be put on the list of established claims, the most important question is the level of scientifi c evidence needed. The Finnish food industry is of the view that with Article 13 claims, textbook data and nutrition references should suffi ce, and no new scientifi c studies on the product itself should be required. The food supplement industry wishes that studies carried out with ingredients should suffi ce. The entrepreneurs acknowledge the need for product-specifi c proof on Article 14 claims, i.e. claims pertaining to the reduction of the risk of disease and the health and development of children.1225 The Finnish list was based on fairly strict scientifi c criteria, as Finnish scientists share the view that claims must not be approved without convincing evidence. However, the Commission seems to be even stricter and in autumn 2008 it seems that few Finnish claims will be accepted. It remains to be seen whether the fi nished Community list will be very short and abolish many of the health claims that are currently used.After discussing the process for establishing the Community list, we now turn to legal issues related to adding claims to the list after 2010. An application is needed for these claims, which are: based on newly developed scientifi c evidence and/or a) which include a request for the protection of proprietary data.b) Any Article 13 claims submitted to the EU list after the publication of the fi rst list in 2010 will have to be examined by the EFSA and approved by the Commission and Member States1226. A food business operator intending to use a health claim not included in the Article 13 list may apply for the inclusion of the claim in that list1227 according to the procedure stipulated in Article 18 of the Regulation. Article 18 applies to claims that are based on newly developed scientifi c evidence and/or include a request for the protection of proprietary data1228.1222 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 17.1223 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 20.1224 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 20.1225 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland 2007, 24.1226 Through the Committee procedure according to Article 25 of the Regulation.1227 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 18(1).1228 Article 13(5) of the Regulation.-220-The application for the inclusion shall be submitted to the national competent authority of a Member State. The application shall include the reasons for the request, along with the following data:the name and address of the applicant;(a) the nutrient or other substance, or the food or the category of food, in respect of which (b) the health claim is to be made and its particular characteristics;a copy of the studies, including, where available, independent, peer-reviewed studies, (c) which have been carried out with regard to the health claim and any other material which is available to demonstrate that the health claim complies with the criteria provided for in this Regulation;where appropriate, an indication of the information which should be regarded as (d) proprietary accompanied by verifi able justifi cation;a copy of other scientifi c studies which are relevant to that health claim;(e) a proposal for the wording of the health claim for which authorisation is sought (f) including, as the case may be, specifi c conditions for use;a summary of the application. (g) 1229The Member State will send the application to the EFSA to be assessed, and to the Commission and the Member States for information. The EFSA shall perform scientifi c assessment of the claim (within fi ve months) and subsequently issue its opinion to the applicant, to the Commission and to the Member States, and publish it.1230If the EFSA opinion is in favour of the applicant, the Commission shall take a decision on the application (within two months), taking into account:the EFSA opinion, -any relevant provisions of Community law, -other legitimate factors - relevant to the matter under consideration, andresults of consultation with the Member States. - 1231According to the EFSA pre-submission guidance of March 2007 (revised August 2007), Article 18 procedure is not applicable before the aforementioned Community list of permitted health claims is adopted.1232 This would have meant January 2010. However, the EFSA seems to have changed their mind and started to take in Article 18 applications already in February 2008. This is confi rmed by the December 2007 Guidance from the Scientifi c Committee on Food Safety and Animal Health of the European Commission1233: "From 1 February 2008 Member States can send valid applications to the EFSA for the scientifi c assessment in accordance with Article 18(3)". However, the EFSA has not yet given guidance on how to draft Article 18 claims.1229 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 15(3).1230 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 18(3).1231 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 18(4).1232 EFSA Pre-submission Guidance for Applicants Intending to Submit Application for Authorisation of Health Claims made on Foods. Publication Date: 14 March 2007 Last updated (Rev. ): 8 August 2007, page 4.1233 Scientifi c Committee Claim Guidance 2007, 12.-221-Article 18 is similar to Article 13, with the exception that the evidence submitted is "newly developed scientifi c evidence." The legislation does not defi ne "new", but it is understood as scientifi c evidence developed after January 31, 2008 (the deadline for Article 13 submissions). Because the EFSA started to grant applications via the Article 18 route from the beginning of February 2008, some companies might consider withdrawing under Article 13 and resubmitting under Article 18. This is because the Article 18 procedure is faster than the Article 13 procedure as the EFSA and the Commission will have to abide by the time limits of fi ve and two months. However, if the data was published by either an applicant or a third party before January 31, 2008, the data is not 'new' and therefore belongs under Article 13.1234 If the claim is based on proprietary data, Article 18 applies regardless of the time when the data was established.Like the borderline between nutrition claims and function claims, the borderline between function claims and disease risk reduction claims has also already shown to be problematic. The Commission Scientifi c Committee Guidance of December 20071235 clarifi es the issue: If a risk factor of a disease is merely mentioned, without stating, suggesting or implying its reduction, the claim should be considered a function claim (Article 13 claim). An example of a function claim is given: maintains [naming normal vital function of the body]. If reduction of a disease risk factor is claimed, the claim should be considered an Article 14 claim regardless of whether the name of the disease itself is mentioned. An example is given: lowers [naming risk factor].12365.3.3.5.3 Article 14: Disease Risk Reduction Claims and Claims Related to Children's HealthAs stated above, two Community lists of authorised claims will be created. The list based on Article 14 will include reduction of disease risk claims and claims relating to children's development and health. These claims are evaluated by EFSA according to the procedure laid down in Articles 15, 16, 17 and 19 of the Regulation. These claims may be made only if they have been authorised according to the relevant procedure and included in the Community list for such claims. The list of claims will include the conditions for the use of the claims.1237 The claims are of the type 'compound A reduces the risk of heart disease'.In addition to the general requirements for claims and general requirements for health claims, reduction of disease risk claims must be joined with another additional piece of information: The labelling, presentation or advertising shall bear a statement indicating that the disease to which the claim is referring has multiple risk factors and that altering one of these risk factors may or may not have a benefi cial effect.1238Article 15 of the Regulation stipulates the details of the application for authorisation. The application shall be sent to the national competent authority of a Member State. The national competent authority shall send the application as a whole to EFSA. EFSA shall send the application to other Member States and the Commission, and publish the summary of the application.1234 Tallon 2008. 1235 Guidance on the Implementation of Regulation Ndeg 1924/2006 on Nutrition and Health Claims Made on Foods. Conclusions of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. 14 December 2007.1236 Scientifi c Committee Claim Guidance 2007, page 13.1237 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 14(2).1238 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 14(2).-222-The EFSA has provided guidance on the details of the application. The EFSA published its much-anticipated guidelines on disease risk reduction claims in July 20071239. The 44-page document, prepared by the Scientifi c Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies, can be accessed via EFSA's website1240. Based on EFSA guidelines, food companies have put systems in place to ensure they are in as strong a position as possible. Companies want to ensure that existing claims can still be made, and to prepare for future disease risk reduction claims1241.The EFSA guidance applies to health claims related to the consumption of a food category, a food, or its constituents, including a nutrient or other substance, or a combination of nutrients/other substances. The purpose of the guidance is to assist applicants in preparing and presenting their applications for authorisation of health claims which fall under Article 14 of the Regulation, i.e. reduction of disease risk claims and claims referring to children's development and health.The EFSA Guidance "presents a common format for the organisation of the information to assist the applicant in the preparation of a well-structured application". According to EFSA, adherence to the format will facilitate them to do its work in an effective and consistent way. EFSA "strongly advises" the applicant to adhere to the Guidance for preparing their application. A ready-to-use word-format of the application is also provided1242.1243The application for an Article 14 claim shall include the following data1244:the name and address of the applicant;(a) the nutrient or other substance, or the food or the category of food, in respect of which (b) the health claim is to be made and its particular characteristics;a copy of the studies, including, where available, independent, peer-reviewed studies, (c) which have been carried out with regard to the health claim and any other material which is available to demonstrate that the health claim complies with the criteria provided for in the Regulation;where appropriate, an indication of the information which should be regarded as (d) proprietary accompanied by verifi able justifi cation;a copy of other scientifi c studies which are relevant to that health claim;(e) a proposal for the wording of the health claim for which authorisation is sought (f) including, as the case may be, specifi c conditions for use;a summary of the application. (g) 12451239 Opinion of the Panel on dietetic products, nutrition and allergies (NDA) on a request from the Commission related to scientifi c and technical guidance for the preparation and presentation of the application for authorisation of a health claim. Adopted 06/07/2007. The draft opinion was published in May 2007, after which stakeholders had a chance to give their comments before adoption of the fi nal version.1240 EFSA web page at: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/EFSA/efsa_locale-1178620753812_1178623592448.htm.1241 Nutraingredients.com.

The Summary of the Application should be presented in a standardized form. Therefore it is mandatory to use the form provided in the Appendix B of the EFSA Guidance. The summary The Summary shall be preferably presented in English and shall not contain parts which are considered to be confi dential as summaries are published on the EFSA website. 1246Now we turn to what happens after the applicant has done his share. After receiving an application, EFSA has fi ve months to give its opinion1247. In order to prepare its opinion, the Authority shall verify:that the health claim is substantiated by scientifi c evidence;(a) that the wording of the health claim complies with the criteria laid down in the (b) Regulation.1248EFSA shall forward its opinion to the Commission, the Member States and the applicant. The opinion shall include a report describing assessment of the health claim and stating the reasons and grounds for EFSA opinion. Article 16(4) particularly1249 must be listed in an opinion in favour of authorising the health claim. EFSA shall make its opinion public, and the applicant and the public may make comments to the Commission within 30 days from such publication.After receiving the EFSA opinion, the Commission has two months to submit a draft decision1250 to its Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. When drafting the decision, the Commission shall take into account:EFSA opinion, -any relevant provisions of Community law, and -other legitimate factors relevant to the matter under consideration. -Where the draft decision is not in accordance with the EFSA opinion, the Commission shall provide an explanation for the differences. Use of the term "other legitimate factors" grants the Commission wide discretionary powers to include other than scientifi c factors in their decision-making. A draft decision to amend the lists of permitted health claims shall include 1246 EFSA pre-submission health claim guidelines to applicants 2007, 5-6.1247 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 16(1).1248 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 16(3).1249 (a) the name and address of the applicant;(b) the nutrient or other substance, or the food or the category of food, in respect of which a claim is to be made and its particular characteristics;(c) a proposal for the wording of the health claim, including, as the case may be, the specifi c conditions of use;(d) where applicable, conditions or restrictions of use of the food and/or an additional statement or warning that should accompany the health claim on the label and in advertising.1250 The decision on whether or not to include the claim on the Community list.-224-the particulars referred to in Article 16(4)1251. The Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health shall adopt a fi nal decision in accordance with the Committee procedure. The Commission shall without delay inform the applicant of the decision taken and publish details of the decision in the Offi cial Journal of the European Union.Above, we have discussed the borderline between nutrition claims and health claims, and the borderline between function claims and disease risk reduction claims. Also the distinction between claims referring to children's development and health and other health claims has required further clarifi cation by the Commission. As stated above, Article 14 covers claims that refer to "children's development and health".
