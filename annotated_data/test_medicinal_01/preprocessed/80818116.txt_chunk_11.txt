Materials and methodsA random sample of 62 breast cancer women patients, who were attending the Institute of Oncology of the UCCK were included in the study. The study period was between the end of February 2014 until the middle of May, 2014. The study was approved by ethics committee from Univer-sity Clinical Centre of Kosovo (UCCK). Patients were in-formed about the purpose of the study questionnaire and were voluntarily included in the study and gave the ver-bal informed consent. The personal interview with patients was conducted by the clinician. Obtained results were ana-lyzed with current published literature. Results and discussion62 women with breast cancer were interviewed. The patients' mean age was 50.0 (SD 10.9), with a range of 32-80 years. Most of the patients were married (91.9%) and had completed primary or secondary education (71%), while 16.1 % had completed high school/university. Most of patients had undergone chemotherapy (96.8%) and 82.3% of patients had undergone surgical treatment-mastectomy. The disease stage of patients was as following: 11.3% stage 0-I, 30.6% stage II, 58.1% stage III-IV, while 29% had distant metastasis. Mean scores for the GH/QoL, physical, role, emotion-al, cognitive and social functioning subscales were above 33 suggesting there were no problems regarding their func-tioning. Mean scores of symptom scales were less than 66 for almost all symptom scale and/or items suggesting lack of severe symptomatology among patients with exception for financial difficulties with mean score of 92.47 indicat-ing financial problems for women with breast cancer. Eight subscales achieved the acceptable standard of S1 PP 2260Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 59 - 60 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsreliability (>= 0.70), exception was only the cognitive scale which was 0.54. The highest score of internal consistency was 0.96 for GH/QoL. The convergent validity testing showed that all cor-relation coefficients between an item and its own subscale were >= 0.40 with the exception of item 5 (self care) with (r = -0.22). In Table 3 are presented Spearman's correla-tion coefficients between each item and its own subscale. The correlation coefficients ranged from -0.22 to 0.98. Item 7 (hobbies/limited leisure activities) had strongest negative correlation with its corresponding role function-ing subscale, as well as item 25 (memory difficulties) with its corresponding cognitive functioning subscale. Items 29 (physical condition) and 30 (general QoL) had the stron-gest positive correlation with their corresponding GH/QoL as well as item 14 (nausea) with its corresponding nausea and vomiting subscale. The results for item discriminant validity were satisfactory, with exception for item 5 (self care) which showed higher correlation with other subscales (role functioning, social functioning, GH/QoL), vomiting and pain than with its corresponding physical functioning. Generally the QLQ-C30 subscales showed moderate to strong correlation with each other. Exception was a strong relationship between fatigue with GH/QoL (r = 0.73), fatigue with physical functioning (r = 0.72) and between pain with fatigue (r = 0.70). Findings of known group comparisons according to the disease stage generally showed that patients with ad-vanced stages of breast cancer (stages III-IV) had high-er symptomatic scores than those in early stages. Howev-er, none of these differences was statistically significant. In terms of education level, patients with high school/uni-versity reported higher cognitive functioning compared to other subgroups (p = 0.03), other functional scales differ-ences were not statistically significant. Interestingly, pa-tients with secondary school showed better GH/QoL than patients with high school/university (p = 0.009). ConclusionIn this initial study the EORTC QLQ-C30 (version 3.0) in Albanian language for breast cancer women patients was found to be reliable and valid. Although the sample size was small and in the study were included only women with breast cancer it is still important for its preliminary infor-mation on validity and reliability of the EORTC QLQ-C30 in Albanian language. Studies with larger number of pa-tients, including male patients as well as other groups of cancer patients and test-retest reliability are recommended to assess the results of this initial study.

Polychronakis21City College, University Of Sheffield 3, LeontosSofou Street, 546 26 Thessaloniki, Greece2University of Salford, Salford Business School, Salford, M5 4WT, United Kingdom* margig33@yahoo.comIntroductionThe concept of Pharmaceutical Care (PC), perceived as a responsible pharmacist's philosophy, aiming to sup-ply the community with quality medicines and reliable ser-vices, (EU, 2012), involves the provision of a complex set of pharmacist's actions with patients and healthcare pro-fessionals for the improved patient's health condition (Ed-mundsa and Calnan, 2001).Additional services, competent activities provided by pharmacists, represents the basis of the PC (Puspitasari, 2009), where one of the services is counseling, a cognitive ability of pharmacists to transfer valuable information and establish a rationale relationship with their patients. Coun-seling, combined with other competences produces addi-tional defined services, the Medication Therapy Manage-ment (MTM) and Disease management, approaches that are managing the disease for achieving positive outcomes (McGivney, 2007). The significance of MTM lies in the ability of the pharmacist systematically to achieve the de-sired therapeutic effects, starting from the therapy review, continuing with the patient's personal record, based on a healthcare management plan (APhA and NACDS Founda-tion, 2008). This is one way how the pharmacists could bring mutual collaboration on a desired level with other healthcare providers, as well. Counseling and MTM en-ables the determination of the therapy regimes (Al Rah-bi, 2013), and playing inevitable role in the health system. Particular important for the health system is the creation of an individualized management programs for elderly pa-tients with chronic diseases, where community pharma-cists are considered one of the best healthcare providers, especially for elderly patients with chronic diseases (Nash, 2001).Research studies have found that in patients, receiving the additional services for their health improvement gen-erates satisfaction with the received attention (Tinelli, et al., 2007). One particular example of successful implemen-tation of additional services is United Kingdom (Paudy-al, et al., 2011), where pharmacists deliver The New Med-icine Service, Medicine use review and Appliance Use Re-views (Wells et al., 2013), with whom pharmacists treat minor ailments with non-prescription medicines, provide information, guidance and education on patients for self-medication (Anderson, 2000).The significance of the PC is practically shown through the generated savings of 600 million dollars for the compliance and additional 700 mil-lion dollars for the improved prescribing (Etemad and Hay, 2003), with only 40 dollars an hour, for what the PC con-cept is remunerated.The aim of this study is to evaluate the current prac-tices of pharmacist in Macedonia, regarding the possibil-ities of future representation of PC through the addition-al services.Materials and methodsQuantitative method was used for the data collec-tion method, using anonymous structured closed ended 33 questions questionnaire, divided in several groups. The sampling population was pharmacists working in pharma-cies in Macedonia. The questionnaire was constructed and distributed through the web site platform Survey Monkey (Palo Alto, CA, United States). The interest in entering the survey occurred in total number of 85 participants, where from 67 completed the survey. Generated data was ana-lyzed using the statistical program SPSS v. 20 (IBM Cor-poration, Armonk, New York, US).The demographic data showed that majority of sur-veyed were females (83.6%), over 90% between 18-45 S1 PP 2362Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 61 - 62 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsyears old, with 80% of surveyed with professional expe-rience below 10 years. Majority of participants were from Skopje and South West Macedonia, 53.7% and 34.3% re-spectively.Results and discussionThe survey showed that 90% of surveyed are famil-iar with the PC, expressing at the same time the need to re-define their community roles.Regarding the additional ser-vices, 92.5% consider to have the competence to provide additional services, for what they have positive respond to patients request for additional services, equally in pa-tients with acute and chronic diseases, out of which, 85% are asking additional advices. Respectively, 60% of sur-veyed have the practice to follow up their patient's med-ical condition, thus in a way they are practicing addition-al services, with 40% giving an example of a particular service they provide. Majority of those services are advic-es for improved diet and healthy life style, better therapy management and counselling for possible medicine inter-actions. Mostly, time spend for additional services is be-tween 5-10 minutes, with only 36% of pharmacists devot-ing below 5 minutes and in only 9% of cases, between 11-15 minutes.The collaboration of pharmacist with doctors is at only 30%, but with a mood at 70% of surveyed, that in-teraction to be improved. Almost all surveyed, 98%, have expressed that proper regulation and remuneration by the health system is important for the practical implementation of additional services.According to 55% of the surveyed, all stakeholders can benefit from PC, where pharmacies, could expect high level of loyalty from their patients and improved economic results.ConclusionThe basis of PC, as a contemporary concept lies in the successful introduction of additional services, for what the pharmacist have the knowledge and capabilities to provide them to their patients. The research found, that majority of surveyed pharmacist are well known with the concept and its essence. Practically, for the patient's interest, they al-ready provide certain services, with which they are helping their patients in therapy management and improved medi-cation results, for what pharmacist are being awarded with high degree of patient's loyalty, which is essential for the functioning of the pharmacies. On the other hand, for the complete introduction of the PC, there is need for a state's support, especially in the part of remuneration with which the pharmacies will be stimulated to deliver even more qualitative approach for their patients and made them eco-nomically more stable and independent.ReferencesAl Rahbi, H.A.M., 2013.

Goce Delcev 9b, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia 2Faculty of Law, FON University, Str. Kiro Gligorov b.b., 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* n.zdraveva@pf.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionThe Macedonian Law on Industrial Property (herein-after: LIP) in general terms defines the patent as an indus-trial property right by which inventions are protected (Ar-ticle 3, par. 1, line 2) and does not restrict patenting phar-maceuticals. In the period for which the patent is granted (20 years, with possibility for additional protection period of up to 5 years for pharmaceuticals) the patent holder en-joys the exclusive rights to use the protected invention in production, marketing goods manufactured as per the pro-tected invention and to dispose the patent. These rights in the same time mean that the patent holder enjoys the right to prohibit third parties to use the patent in production or in trade, including production, offering for sale, export, or import and storage of products for those purposes, without license (LIP, Article 89, par. 1 and 2, in line with Article 27 of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter: TRIPS). By principle rule, the license is obtained by agreement between the patent holder and the third party (licensee) and the scope of the rights transferred to the licensee is mutu-ally agreed by the parties (Dabovic - Anastasovska, 2009). Exception to this rule exists in the cases of the compulso-ry license. Materials and methodsA compulsory license is an authorization granted by competent state body, in Macedonia the court, a third par-ty to use the patented invention without the permission of the patent holder (Dabovic-Anastasovska and Pepeljugos-ki, 2012). This research examines the national legal sys-tem of compulsory licensing in reference to the one estab-lished under the TRIPS and how are the main functions of the system enabled.
