The high percent of the API in the for-mulation support this assumption having in mind that the mechanism of the super-disintegrants is hindered by this high percent of the API (85w/w% of the API in tablet for-mulation).As per the second factor, increase of the average mass of the tablet with other excipients (fillers) did not cause any increase on the dissolution of the API due to the fact that this slight percent of mass increase was not enough to mod-ify and support the mechanism of disintegration related to super-desintegrants.The third factor, particle size of the API (achieved by sizing with different sieve size) was also found to be not influential as the disintegrant type probably due to the API is characterized with high water solubility and penetration of the dissolution media is not hindered by different parti-cle size of the API.ConclusionThe presented study shows that optimized concentra-tion of Starch 1500/ partially pre-geletanized Maize starch and the combination of two selected disintegrants (L-HPC and Primojel/sodium starch glycolate), as well as sizing step of the active pharmaceutical ingredient have influ-ence on the dissolution rate of the highly dose water sol-uble API.ReferencesBolhuis, G.K., Arends,A.W., Stuut, G.J., Vries, J.A., 1994.

There are many naked antibod-ies and immunoconjugates commercially approved for dif-ferent types of cancer (Mehren et al., 2003). In order to im-prove specificity and selectivity of cytotoxic drugs and tox-ins, monoclonal antibodies are used for formulation of im-munoconjugates. Many efforts are done to develop stable immunoconjugates of trastuzumab with various drugs, tox-ins and radioisotopes to improve the general conditions of the patients (Sharkey and Goldenberg, 2006). The aim of this paper is to focus on current achievements in the for-mulation of radioimmunoconjugates of HER2-targeting trastuzumab.Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-body active against HER2 positive breast cancer. It orig-inates from murine antibody 4D5 that is potent inhibitor of HER2 positive cancer cells. Subsequently, it was cho-sen for further clinical development in order to reduce the probability of generation of HAMA (human anti-murine antibody) (Harries and Smith, 2002). Carter et al. (1992) cloned hypervariable regions from 4D5 in plasmids which encode formation of constant regions from human IgG1 antibody and generated a vector that encode formation of chimeric antibody which is additionally humanized. The new humanized 4D5 has higher affinity for the HER2/neu antigen and reduced immunogenicity. Trastuzumab is act-ing by binding to the IV subdomain of the HER2 receptor and Fc region of the antibody support ADCC (antibody-de-pendent cellular cytotoxicity) (Gennari et al., 2004). Radioimmunoconjugates for imaging and therapyBecause of the easy detection, radioimmunoconju-gates can be used for body imaging at a molecular level using sensitive imager like g camera, computed tomogra-phy and positron emission tomography (PET) (Goldenberg, 1997). Significant radiopharmaceuticals based on pep-tide and antibody for diagnostic and therapeutic purpose use different radioisotopes (99mTc/188Re, 67Ga, 177Lu, 90Y, 131I) (Kassis, 2008). In order to obtain successful la-beling, previously conjugaton with a bifuntional chela-tors (DOTA - 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tet-raacetic acid; DTPA - diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; TCMC - (1,4,7,10-tetra-(2-carbamoyl methyl)-cyclodo-decane; HYNIC - succinimidyl-6-hydrazino-nicotinamide; 1B4M-DTPA - 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-6-methyl-dieth-ylene-triaminepentaacetic acid) is required. These chelators allow binding to the antibody on the one side, and coordi-native binding of radioisotopes on the other side (Kang et al., 2012). Immunoconjugates of trastuzumab for PET imagingIn recent years there have been significant achieve-ments in development of stable immunoconjugates of trastuzumab for PET imaging of HER2 positive lesions (Hooge et al., 2004). Chen et al. (2008) used 99mTc in or-der to create a stable conjugate, 99mTc-NYCIN-trastu-zumab, useful for identification of HER2 positive metas-tasis. Tamura et al. (2010) have shown the possibility of identification of HER2 positive lesions in patients with pri-S4 PP 198418Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 417 - 418 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsmary metastatic breast cancer with 64Ga-DOTA-trastu-zumab. Three years later, Alitezapour et al. (2013) were able to formulate similar conjugate with another gam-ma emitter 67Ga-DOTA-trastuzumab for the same pur-pose. Investigations of Palm et al. (2003) for pharmaco-kinetics of trastuzumab labeled with pure b emitters 86Y and 90Y in mice with ovarian cancershown a selective up-take of the conjugate by the tumor cells and minimal lo-calization in healthy organs. In vitro and in vivo investiga-tions in mice with breast tumor show that 177Lu-DOTA-trastuzumab can be new promising drug in treatment of hu-man breast cancer (Rasaneh et al., 2012). Tan et al. (2012) have shown that 212Pb-TCMC-trastuzumab has a signifi-cant therapeutic effect in HER2/neu positive prostate can-cer. Borchardt et al. (2003) have tested therapeutic effects of alpha emitters 227Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-trastuzumab and 225Ac-trastuzumab in mice with HER2 positive breast and ovarian cancer. Studies have shown rapid internalization and cytotoxicity in cancer cells which leads to a extend sur-vival and low toxicity.Our examinations will be focused on synthesis and evaluation of the immunoconjugates of trastuzumab with bifunctional chelators (DOTA, DTPA and 1B4M-DTPA) with already used method for freeze dried kit formula-tion of rituximab-conjugates. The most stable immunocon-jugate will be labeled with gamma emitter Ga-68 for fur-ther in vitro characterization and in vivo biodistribution. The simplicity of Ga-68 labeling will increase the access of radioimmunoconjugates in hospitals for PET imaging of HER2 positive metastasis.

Macedonia* aschuradio@yahoo.comBackgroundThis article describes trends in Radiopharmacy in the developing countries and the current status of Radiophar-macy Practice in Eastern Africa.The main goal of our presentation is to show and to stress the importance of existing problems related to the missing of the exact information on the number, status and size of Radiopharmacy units in African countries as the re-gional status as well as for the human resources, education, suitable training and local demand for the Radiopharmacy and Nuclear Medicine services is not documented (Don-di, 2006).The Radiopharmacy Practice by the definition requires well-defined and controlled conditions to avoid any risk contamination with microbes, pyrogens and particulate matter as well as cross contamination with other radiophar-maceuticals, together with established radiation protection.Implementation of the Good Radiopharmaceuti-cal Practices in all levels in the Radiopharmacy should be planned, introduced by the planned priority and strict-ly monitored and reordered in the production, prepara-tion, testing and in the packaging areas for all final prod-uct ready for use.The practice of nuclear medicine using established ra-diopharmaceuticals, mostly from the first generation has clinical applications in virtually all systems of the body, for example, the skeletal, cardiac, endocrine, oncologic, gastrointestinal and renal systems. The commoner nucle-ar medicine procedures in African developing countries are the bone scan, thyroid scan and the renal scan respective-ly.Almost all radiopharmaceuticals are parenterally admin-istered and requires techniques and procedures that guar-antee sterility of the product done according to the clear-ly defined protocol and and established and controlled con-ditions. The critical moment for the realization of all these necessities is to have suitably staff, enough educated and trained to provide the implementation and development in the right direction.Radiopharmacy professionals should have an adequate training in all aspects of the sterile production, quality con-trol, GMP, GLP, radiation safety and radiochemistry to en-sure the competent handling of the radioactive materials (IAEA NUMDAB, 2009).MethodologyThe practice of radiopharmacy combines the exper-tise of pharmaceutical preparation and the skills needed to handle radioactive substances. Diagnostic radiopharma-ceuticals do not normally have any pharmacologicale ffect and their administration is not associated with major clin-ical side effects. Their clinical use, however, is associated with a risk deriving from radiation exposure and possible contamination during radiopharmaceutical formulation by chemical, biological and microbiological impurities.Accordingly, principles of Good Practices should be planned in all levels, by priority and strictly observed in the production, preparation, testing and the packaging of the final product ready for use. The main powerful key for implementing Good Radiopharmaceutical Practice is qual-ified and trained personnel. Trained and competent staffs are essential for achieving high standards and growth in Radiopharmacy. In African Countries there is an acute shortage and in some countries an absence of nationally registered pharmacists with radiopharmacy experience. Most nuclear medicine facilities operate their radiophar-macies with the support of technologists not trained in ra-diopharmacy practices. For that reason the basic quali-S4 PP 199420Maced. pharm.
