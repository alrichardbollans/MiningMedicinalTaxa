Prediction is made based on the chemical's molecular structure and physicochemical properties. The program contains a knowledge base of structure-metabolism relationships and each describes a metabolic reaction, characteristic of xenobiotics with a common structural feature. METEOR reasoning rule-base contains 841 rules, 217 mammalian Phase I and II biotranformations allowing the program to evaluate the relative probabilities of various metabolic pathways (Langowski & Long, 2002). Results are accompanied by comments and literature citations as evidence that is specific, making evaluations easier. The strength of METEOR lies in its ability to predict the metabolites that are likely to be generated rather than all possible candidates (Greene et al., 1999).In certain circumstances, experimental data from metabolism studies discloses empirical formula of metabolites and not their molecular structure, which effectively impair a thorough assessment of the possible chemical properties such as toxicity possess by the metabolites since different molecular structure denotes different activities. The program is capable of recommending the most likely molecular structure and even anticipates different promising structures from the same empirical formula.

Hydrogen options: perceive implicit and explicit hydrogens.2.11 RESULTS| The METEOR programme predicted plausible andrographolide metabolites in Phase I and| II biotransformation and the possible routes are summarised as a metabolic tree in Figurej 2.15. The data used for the tree construction were generated by METEOR and variousreactions that contributed to this process are also stated. Figure 2.17 is the same metabolicij tree but instead of empirical formula, the tree shows molecular weight. As thei| biotransformation pathway progresses, the molecular weight of the metabolites predicted| increased. Another metabolite tree shown as Figure 2.18 is essentially the same as the onei| depicted in Figure 2.15 but highlighted the Phase II reactions in blue while those that cani| be achieved by cytochrome P450 are shown in other lighter colours.Although the empirical formulae of all possible metabolites were shown in Figure 2.15, various different chemical structures can be derived from the same chemical formula, a task METEOR was equipped to handle. Due to the large size of information generated, examples of selected reactions involving the metabolism of andrographolide are shown in Figures 2.16a to 2.16f.Copy I 87Y.

SharifuddinChapter 22.12 DISCUSSIONThe metabolic tree suggested by METEOR is useful in the initial prediction of possible metabolites of andrographolide especially when there is currently a paucity of sufficient data. Figure 2.15 shows all possible metabolites derived from andrographolide, the parent compound. Various functional groups attached to the aglycone provide many possible substrates for Phase I and Phase II enzymes. The progression of the metabolic tree also showed steady increment in molecular weight and polarity of the metabolites by the addition of other groups such as glutathione and glucuronide as shown in Figure 2.17. The resultant metabolites possess higher polarity and hydrophilicity mainly attributed to the high molecular weight of the conjugates, hence facilitates their excretion from the body. As depicted both in Figures 2.17 and 2.18, the molecular size of the metabolites produced by Phase II reactions were higher that those subjected to Phase I metabolism. Indeed, the Phase II biotransformation reactions with the exception of acetylation and methylation, result in a large increase of xenobiotic hydrophilicity (Gibson & Skett, 2001). The extract of Andrographis paniculata including andrographolide and its analogues have been shown to affect hepatic biotransformation enzymes such as anilinehydroxylase, N- and O- demethylase (Choudhary & Poddar, 1984), alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (Trivedi & Rawal, 2000) as well as glutathione S-transferase and DT- diaphorase (Phase II biotransformation enzymes) (Singh et al., 2001).Several metabolites of andrographolide have also been identified in rats and humans. Ten metabolites of andrographolide mainly in the form of sulfonic acid conjugates and sulfate compounds were isolated and identified in urine, feces as well as contents of small intestine after the compound was orally administered to rats (He et al., 2003a, b, c). Cui et al. (2004) also reported structural identification of four urinary metabolites of andrographolide from human volunteers, of which three of the metabolites were categorised as 3-O-sulfate conjugates and the remaining one as 3-O-sulfate-12-S-cysteine conjugate. An additional seven Phase II metabolites were isolated from human urine and all were characterised as glucuronide conjugates, where four were found to be two pairs of geometric isomers (Cui et al., 2005). All these findings are in line with the predictions made by METEOR in terms of plausible reactions that might be involved in andrographolide metabolism where different functional groups such as primary aliphatic alcohols and epoxides are being targeted by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and glutathione S-transferases respectively.Copy 1 94Y. SharifuddinChapter 2Indeed, assessment of andrographolide structure by DEREK identified the a, p-unsaturated ester position as capable of educing chromosome damage and METEOR also suggested that this position is susceptible to conjugation with glutathione as illustrated in Figure 2.16c. Furthermore, compounds containing the a, p-unsaturated ester has been known to be metabolised via conjugation with glutathione and hydrolysis (Frederick et al., 1992; Greim et al., 1995; McCarthy & Witz, 1997).
