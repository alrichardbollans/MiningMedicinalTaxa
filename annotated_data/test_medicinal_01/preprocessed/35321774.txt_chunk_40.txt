ATC classification was used. Data was considered interms of DDD and monetary indicators. Results were compared withofficial publications on drug consumption from Norway and Denmark.OBTAINED RESULTS(for brevity, abstract will show data for 2009 only) Population of Croa-tia, Norway and Denmark in 2009 was 4.4, 4.7 and 5.5 million respec-tively. GDP per capita in Croatia, Norway and Denmark was EUR9.790,EUR54.447 and EUR38.546 respectively. Overall drug consumption in Croa-tia, Norway and Denmark was EUR525, EUR2.243 and EUR1.778 million and1.386, 2.558 and 2.718 million DDD respectively. Main anatomicalgroups used in Croatia were C with EUR127 mill, N with EUR100 mill and Awith EUR82mill. In Norway main anatomical groups used were L with EUR441mill, N with EUR409 mill and C with EUR261 mill. In Denmark main anatom-ical groups used were N with EUR534 mill, R with EUR243 mill and C withEUR242 mill. Most used drugs in terms of DDD in Croatia were amlodip-ine, acetylsalicylic acid and atorvastatin with 75, 70 and 64 mill DDDrespectively. In Norway most used drugs were acetylsalicylic acid, sim-vastatin and sodium fluoride with 123, 115 and 91 mill DDD respec-tively. In Denmark most used drugs were simvastatin, acetylsalicylicacid and paracetamol with 153, 147 and 124 mill DDD respectively.MAIN CONCLUSIONSResults show that higher GDP is followed by higher overall drug con-sumption, both in terms of DDD and monetary indicators. Additionally,all subject countries have similar rate of growth in drug consumption,in terms of DDD and monetary indicators.REFERENCESRonning M. et al, Drug Consumption in Norway 2003-2007, Folkehelseinstituttet, 2008Ronning M. et al, Drug Consumption in Norway 2004-2008,Folkehelseinstituttet, 2009Ronning M. et al, Drug Consumption in Norway 2005-2009, Folkehelseinstituttet, 2010Poulsen J. et al, Medicinal Product Statistics Denmark, 2005-2009 Total Sales,Danish Medicines Agency, 2010www.worldbank.org99Macedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011PHARMACOECONOMY / SOCIAL PHARMACY / PHARMACOINFORMATICS oral presentationsFIFTH CONGRESS OF PHARMACY OF MACEDONIA WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATIONDIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS (DRG) PAY-MENT MODEL IN HOSPITALS AND THEISSUE OF EXPENSIVE DRUGSGulija MarijaAD "Dr. Panovski", Skopje, Macedonia DRG payment model to hospitals in Macedonia was introduced in 2008in 51 public hospitals having contracts with the Health Insurance Fundof Macedonia (HIF). Besides data collection on hospital related out-puts, DRG was deployed as prospective payment system.Standardization and price predefinition enables service providers toplan resources, and the central national insurance (HIF) to haveoverview of the scope and type of services paid for, on national andhealth facility level. The weak point of the model is that model doesnot adjust for expenditures for treatments where real costs exceedthe average price. Exceed in cost mainly regards use of specific ex-pensive drugs/therapies and medical devices. In Macedonia nationwide, there is no conducted structured nationalcosting study and reliable data on inpatient acute budget for publichealth institutions. Thus, this study estimates and evaluates only ex-pensive therapeutic approaches for first line treatment from dataavailable within the DRG system. Expensive therapeutic first line ap-proaches/therapies were defined. Starting criterion for selection wasset as price per original package calculated for the duration of therapy,resulting in selection of 44 generics. Following the subsequent crite-ria of expensive therapy validation, 19 generics were defined linked to24 DRG codes. After additional adjustments of all 665 DRG referenceprices, still the costs of therapy including 13 generics cannot be cov-ered by the reference price of 24 DRG codes. This first line expensivetreatment drugs represent over 50% of the DRG reference price.The study gives overview of some weaknesses of the methodologyused to calculate DRG cost weights linked to implementation of ex-pensive therapy, suggesting that national costing study is absolutelynecessary for further implementation of DRG as payment methodol-ogy. Thus, it is very important to conduct a national costing study tounderstand real costs of services provided and consequently decidehow and which expensive drugs/therapies should be excluded fromDRG budget.MODELOT NA PLAKjANjE KONBOLNITsITE PREKU DIJAGNOSTIChKOSRODNI GRUPI (DSG) I PRAShANjATA NASKAPITE LEKOVIGulija MarijaAD ,,D-r Panovski", Skopje, MakedonijaDijagnostichko srodni grupi (DSG) kako model na plakjanje nabolnitsite beshe voveden vo Makedonija vo 2008 godina, vo nad 50javni bolnitsi koi imaa dogovor so Fondot za zdravstvenoosiguruvanje na Makedonija (FZOM).

Resistance to antibiotics is a major publichealth problem and it is associated with prior, usually inadequate,receipt of antibiotics. As limited information is available aboutantibiotic use among children in Serbia, data regarding antibiotics usein childhood are very valuable for assessment of rational antibioticuse, as well as for assessment of compliance with guidelines. Nationalguidelines for antibiotic prescribing in the primary health care practice(NGA) recommends the following antibiotics for the treatment ofrespiratory and otorhinolaryngology diseases: amoxicillin as first line,than amoxicillin with clavulanic acid as a second line, andcephalosporines of II and III generation as a third line of therapy, whilema crolides (firstly erythromycin, and than azithromycin) are rec o m -men ded in the cases of penicillins and cephalosporins sensitivity (1). OBJECTIVES(i) To investigate prescription (Rx) antibiotic use in the children underfive years of age (ii) To assess compliance with NGA. METHODSThis was retrospective study for the period 2008-2010 within twopopulations of children in Nisava region: infants (up to 12 months ofage) (3.377) and children aged 1-4 years (13.889). Data base ofdispensed Rx drugs in the Public Pharmacy Nis was used as the sourceof data. The common pharmacoepidemiology unit was used forexpression of antibiotics usage (defined daily doses (DDD) perthousand of inhabitants per day). The following respiratory andotorhinolaryngology diseases were observed (Internationalclassification of diseases 10): acute bronchitis (J20), chronic bronchitis(J42), pneumonia (J12-J18), tonsillopharyngitis (J02, J03), otitis media(H65), acute sinusitis (J01), and chronic sinusitis (J32). RESULTSThe most used drugs among infants during the period 2008-2010 werepenicillins, amoxicillin (10.227, 8.6410, and 9.0840 DDD/1000inhabitants/day, respectively) and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid(4.3448, 4.0602, and 4.4160 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day).Cephalosporins were on the second place, with the following usage:cefixime (III generation) 2.8071, 2.7908, and 3.0018; cephalexin (Igeneration) 2.5276, 2.1463 and 2.3446 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day; andcefprozil (II generation) 1.3824, 1.7329, and 1.5788 DDD/1000inhabitants/day, respectively. Macrolides were on the third place, andazithromycin dominated in this group of drugs with the followingusage: 2.2029, 5.1022 and 2.5591 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day,respectively, while the use of erythromycin was only 0.075, 0.1399, and0.7667 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day, respectively. Penicillins were, also,the most frequently used antibiotics in the 1-4 years old children, butamoxicillin with clavulanic acid was dominated compare to amoxicillin(11.3997, 10.7532, and 9.7234 vs. 8.6314, 5.2057 and 8.1902 DDD/1000inhabitants/day, respectively). Cephalosporins and especiallymacrolides, particularly azithromycin, were more used among thispopulation compare to infants. The use of cefixime during theobserved period was 4.8121, 5.2057, and 4.2972; cephalexin: 3.5122,2.9521, and 2.7033; cefprozil: 2.2878, 2.3174, and 1.7379 DDD/1000inhabitants/day. The use of azithromycin was 4.1783, 8.7857, and4.2299, and the use of erythromycin was 0.3192, 0.3191, and 0.5188DDD/1000 inhabitants/day, respectively. Observing the NGA forantibiotics use in respiratory infections, it is clear that the physiciansare well informed and compliant with the recommendations forinfants, while it is not within the children 1-4 years old. Moreover,exception of compliance with NGA could be seen in macrolides usage(high use of azithromycin and low use of erythromycin).CONCLUSIONBesides physicians are compliant with the NGA in children of one yearof age, the noncompliance with the recommendations in the 1-4 yearsold children was estimated and assessed as it could be non-rational.Further and broader assessment of antibiotics use in Serbia should beuseful, as well as additional education of health care providers.
