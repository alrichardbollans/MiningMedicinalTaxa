Reducing toxicity to the health cells and potential drug degradation is important for achieving an effective treatment (Chan-da et al., 2011; Kaur and Kakkar, 2010). Liposomes are considered to be excellent models of cell membranes, as well as for stabilizing the pharmaceutical active substanc-es (Chanda et al., 2011; Kaur and Kakkar, 2010). Phospho-lipids and cholesterol assembled in one or more lipid bi-layers with an aqueous core are the main components in the microscopic spherical liposome vesicles (Chanda et al., 2011). The specific characteristics of the liposomes such as non-toxicity, flexibility, targetability to specific cells or tis-sues, and biodegradation make them drug carriers, reduc-ing drug toxicity through encapsulation (Kaur and Kakkar, 2010; Patel et al., 2009). The importance of their utilization is due to the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic, hydrophil-ic, and amphiphilic active pharmaceutical substances (Go-mez-Henz and Fernandez-Romero, 2006; Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2012). Generally, liposome formulations are classi-fied based on their structural characteristics, substances in their composition, size and lamellarity, method of prepara-tion, and their application (Kaur and Kakkar, 2010; Sahas-rabuddhe et al., 2012). Ketoconazole (cis-1-acetyl-4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxo-lan-4-yl]methoxy]phenyl]piperazine) is a chiral lipophilic imidazole antimycotic drug administered mainly as a race-mic mixture (50:50) of enantiomers in the cis configura-tion. The decomposition of the drug could be easily caused through acidic, chemical, photolytic, and oxidative con-ditions. Commercially available ketoconazole pharma-ceutical dosage forms such as topical cream, antidandruff shampoo, ointments, and tablets possess anti-inflammato-ry and some antibacterial activities (Patel et al., 2009; Sa-hasrabuddhe et al., 2012). Potential nephrotoxicity, hepato-toxicity, and decomposition of ketoconazole require prep-aration of new safety formulations (Patel et al., 2009). In the ketoconazole liposome preparation, a thin-film hydra-tion (Patel et al., 2009) and an injection method using ei-ther chloroform (Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2012) or dichloro-methane (Patel et al., 2009) were described. The potential adverse effects of alkyl halide solvents (WHO, 2004) em-phasize the aim of this work for introducing less toxic sol-vent such as methanol in ketoconazole liposome prepara-tion through injection method. Materials and methodsStandard ketoconazole was received as a gift from Pharmaceutical Company Replek Farm DOOEL-Sko-pje, Republic of Macedonia. Analytical grade methanol, HPLC grade methanol and water were supplied from Mer-ck (Germany). Cholesterol was supplied from Calbiochem (Japan) and L-a-phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk) was from Sigma (Germany). Potassium hydrogen phosphate and po-tassium dihydrogen phosphate were supplied from Alka-loid AD (Republic of Macedonia). An analytical balance Mettler Toledo (Switzerland) was used for the sample S4 PP 185392Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 391 - 392 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsweighing with 0.1 mg accuracy. A magnetic stirrer (type MM-530 Tehnika Zelezniki, Slovenia), a rotary evapo-rator (Devarot Elektromedicina, Slovenia), and a centri-fuge (MRC, Pharmachem, Republic of Macedonia) were used in the ketoconazole vesicle preparation. An Agilent Technologies 1200 high-pressure liquid chromatograph-ic (HPLC) system (USA) equipped with a diode array de-tector (G1315D), a binary pump (G1312A), a degasser (G1379B), a thermostatted column (TCC G1316A), and an autosampler (ALS G1329A) were used for the encap-sulation efficiency determination of ketoconazole in lipo-some formulations. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a column LiChrospher(r)100 C-18 (150 mm length x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 um particle size) with a mixture of methanol and water (90:10 v/v) mobile phase adjusted to pH 8.90 with a phosphate buffer. The absorbance was re-corded at 296 nm. The morphology of ketoconazole lipo-somes was determined with an optical microscope Konus, (type M-100-FL, Italy), equipped with a digital camera (Sony, Cyber-shot W, type DSCW830V.CE3) and a lens ZEISS Vario-Tessar 8x (China). Ketoconazole, L-a-phosphatidylcholine, and choles-terol in the weight ratio of 3.3:1:3.3 w/w/w were trans-ferred with 5 mL methanol in a 100 mL round-bottom flask. Following the homogenization process on the mag-netic stirrer at 1000 min-1, methanol was evaporated in the rotary evaporator at 55 degC and 80 min-1 (10 min). The lip-id mixture was added to a portion of 5 mL distilled water (80 degC). The ketoconazole liposome mixture was left over-night in order to mature at 4 degC. The separation of the li-posome and free amount of ketoconazole was done in the centrifuge at 5000 min-1 for 10 min.Results and discussionIn the preparation of ketoconazole liposomes through injection method, the solubility of ketoconazole was con-sidered as a criterion of choosing less toxic methanol in-stead of chloroform (Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2012). The large unilamellar ketoconazole liposome vesicles were prepared using the injection method with methanol. The determined encapsulation efficiency of the ketoconazole li-posome formulations in methanol of 45% was smaller in comparison to the encapsulation efficiency of the ketocon-azole in chloroform (71%) obtained by Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2012. The smaller encapsulation efficiency was justi-fied with harmless preparation conditions of ketoconazole liposome formation with methanol. The encapsulation effi-ciency and morphological appearance were followed with evaluated stability of ketoconazole liposome formulations at 4 degC and 25 degC, during a month. After the first week and one month of the liposome preparation, during stabil-ity test at 4 degC, the encapsulation efficiency was 43% and 40%, respectively. At 25 degC, the encapsulation efficiency was decreased to 40% after the first week of the prepa-ration, while after one month, the determined encapsula-tion efficiency was 45% less than the initial value. The uni-formed liposome appearance with a tendency of aggrega-tion at higher temperature (25 degC) during one month sta-bility test was confirmed using microscopic analysis. The drug leakage increases at higher temperature as a result of higher lipid fluidity (Patel et al., 2009).ConclusionThe injection method using methanol could be applied in the ketoconazole liposome preparation. Process and for-mulation parameters should be further optimized to obtain vesicles with higher encapsulation efficiency, improving stability after preparation, as well as in simulated condi-tions, and sterilizing the obtained liposomes.

It has been widely used in numerous quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predict-ing the pharmaceutical properties of molecules (Hughes, 2008). Determination of distribution coefficient is com-monly used to predict the drug transport through biological membranes and to test the effect of drug promoters on drug distribution (fanic, 2016). Bile salts are known for their function as modifiers of drug penetration across the bio-logical membranes (Stojancevic, 2013). The effect of bile salts on drug penetration appears to be complex and it de-pends on the physico-chemical properties of the drug and on interactions of the bile salt with the physiological en-vironment. Taking into account that simvastatin (SV) is a highly lipophilic compound with extremely low water-sol-ubility and bioavailability (<5%), many efforts have been made to increase the aqueous solubility of the drug conse-quently leading to the increase of its bioavailability. Ac-cordingly, the aim of this study was to estimate the influ-ence of semysinthetic bile salt, sodium 12-monoketocho-late (MKC), on the distribution coefficient of simvastatin and to suggest molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect.Material and methodsDistribution coefficients (logD) of SV with or with-out MKC were determined using a "flask-shake" meth-od at pH 5 and pH 7.4, resembling gastrointestinal envi-ronment. The aqueous media used for these pH conditions were 0.1 M sodium acetate and 0.035 M sodium phosphate buffer, respectively, while octanol was used as organic sol-vent. Experiments were performed according to the pro-cedure described by Serajuddin et al. (1991). Concentra-tions of SV were determined by high performance liquid chromatography method according to method described by Carlucci et al. (1991). The detection was performed at 238 nm. In order to analyze theoretically complexation of SV with MKC, semi-empirical PM3 method implemented in MOPAC software package in the Chem3D Ultra 7.0.0 pro-gram has been applied. It was also used for computation of physico-chemical properties of observed compounds to give a better interpretation of obtained in vitro results. Data were analyzed using OriginPro Software (OriginLab Corporation, MA, USA).Results and discussionAs a highly lipophilic molecule and weak acid, in more acidic environment, SV is expected to be more in its neu-tral form that can more easily penetrate biological barriers which explains higher values of distribution coefficient at lower pH (4.70+-0.01 at pH5 vs. 4.59+-0.06 at pH7.4). The experimental logD values of SV were in good agreement with the calculated logD values reported by Serajuddin et al. (1991). Upon addition of MKC, the distribution coeffi-cient of simvastatin significantly decreased at both select-ed pH (4.60+-0.02 at pH 5, and 4.41+-0.05 at pH 7.4). This means that the concentration of SV, i.e. the solubility of simvastatin, in buffer layer is increased in the presence of bile salts. Value logD in system octanol/buffer is dependent on drug solvent interaction. Chemical structure of bile ac-ids is different from ordinary aliphatic surfactants, due to S4 PP 186394Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 393 - 394 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsthe presence of a large, rigid, and planar hydrophobic moi-ety of a steroid nucleus carrying 2-4 hydroxyl groups and an ionic head of a carboxyl group, which provide the mol-ecule a planar polarity with hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains (Mikov, 2006).The increase in SV solubility cor-relates with known high hydrophobicity of SV for which strong hydrophobic interactions with the lipophilic steroid nucleus of bile salt are to be expected and are confirmed in analyzed complex SV-MKC. Significantly higher val-ues of Conolly Accesible Area (SAS), Conolly Molecular Area (MS), and Conolly Solvent Excluded Volume (SEV) of SV-MKC complex than SV alone additionally support experimentally obtained results. MKC has similar struc-ture to cholic acid, differing only in a keto group at the position 12 instead of hydroxyl group. It has been shown that replacing of hydroxyl with keto group in MKC result-ing in decreased membrane toxicity without compromising ability to enhance membrane permeability (Lalic-Popovic, 2013; Stojancevic, 2013), which makes it as a good candi-date for the novel drug formulations. ConclusionOur data indicate that the addition of MKC into the octanol/buffer system decreases the values of SV distribu-tion coefficient. This may be the result of the formation of hydrophilic complexes increasing the solubility of SV that could consequently lead to the increase of its bioavailabil-ity. Results of this study could contribute to the develop-ment of new formulations with improved pharmacokinetic properties and enhanced bioavailability of SV.Acknowledgement This work is supported by Ministry of Education, Sci-ence and Technological Development of Serbia, Project III41012.ReferencesCarlucci, G., Mazzeo, P., Biordi, L., Bologna, M., 1992.
