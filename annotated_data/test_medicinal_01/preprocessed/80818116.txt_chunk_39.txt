Cyril and Methodius, Mother Theresa 17, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* lbogdanovska@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionThe process of evaluation of the efficacy of a given pharmacological treatment, in general, is performed in two subsequent steps: 1) monitoring numerous pre-defined clinical and laboratory parameters which provide informa-tion on treatment benefits and 2) analysis and interpreta-tion of the obtained results. In order to get thorough under-standing of the studied problem, the data obtained in step 2 are studied using chemometric algorithms for multivar-iate data analysis. Compared to the traditional univariate approach, the application of chemometric algorithms pro-vides comprehensive overview of the studied data and re-sults in greater statistical power even when there is small number of observations or missing data points (Helmy et al., 2012).The treatment of periodontal disease consists of scal-ing and root planning followed by local application of an-tiseptics or antibiotics such as chlorhexidine (CHX) and doxycycline (DOX). The efficacy of the treatment is mon-itored using the following parameters: clinical indices (index of gingival inflammation (GI), periodontal pock-et depth (PD) and clinical attachment loss (CAL)) or de-termination ofactivity/concentration of inflammatory bio-markers in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) such as en-zymes: alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydroge-nase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or cyto-kines: interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor -a (TNF-a) (Aimmeti et al., 2012). However, the data analy-sis of the results obtained from monitoring treatment effi-cacy parameters is commonly performed using the tradi-tional approach (Tu et al., 2009). The aim of our study was to perform comparative eval-uation of the efficacy of local periodontal treatment with DOX and local periodontal treatment with CHX using che-mometric algorithm for multivariate data analysis, orthog-onal projection to latent structures - discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Materials and methodsThe subjects enrolled in the study were divided in two groups: a group of 25 patients (DOX group) treated local-ly with 10% DOX gel (controlled-release gel formulation) and a group of 34 patients (CHX group) treated locally with 1% CHX gel (conventional-release gel formulation). DOX group was treated with 115 mg gel containing 10 mg of DOX and the GCF samples were taken 7 days after the local treatment. The CHX group was administered 330 mg gel containing 2 mg CHX and GCF samples were taken 30 min after gel application. GCF samples were collected from quadrants consisting of five periodontal pockets, be-fore and after the local treatment. In brief, paper strips were placed in the selected periodontal pockets until mild resis-tance was felt and left in place for 30 s. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Com-mittee at the Faculty of Dentistry, Skopje.For determination of biomarker activity/concentra-S2 PP 82182Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 181 - 182 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationstion in GCF, five paper strips were placed in 500 mL PBS (phosphate buffer saline, pH=7.4) and the tube was cen-trifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm (4 @C). The resulting so-lutions were divided in two aliquots of 250 mL. The ali-quot for determination of enzyme activity was assayed im-mediately after collection whereas the aliquot for determi-nation of cytokine concentration was added proteinase in-hibitor cocktail and kept at - 80 @C until analysis. ALP, LDH and AST activity in GCF samples was determined using appropriate kits in accordance with the Internation-al Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) recommenda-tions. The concentration of IL-1b and TNF-a in GCF sam-ples was determined according to manufacturer's instruc-tions, using commercial ELISA kits. The clinical indices PD and CAL were measured in mm, while the index of gin-gival inflammation was scored with values 1-3 (1-healthy tissue, 2-moderate inflammation, 3-severe inflammation). The OPLS-DA algorithm was applied using SIMCA 13.0.3 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden). The comparisons of significantly different variables between the DOX group and the CHX group, identified by the OPLS-DA model, were confirmed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test in the SPSS 17 software. P < 0.05 was considered sta-tistically significant.Results and discussionOPLS-DA is a supervised chemometric algorithm widely applied to investigate different treatment effects. The properties of the OPLS-DA provide comprehensive description on the discrimination between classes of sam-ples, especially in cases where subtle differences among classes are present. This algorithm separates the system-atic variation in the matrix X (inflammatory biomarkers and clinical indices for the DOX and the CHX group, in our case) in two parts, one linearly related (variation of interest) to the matrix Y (the classification variables) and one orthogonally related (so-called orthogonal variation or structured noise) to the matrix Y. The partitioning of the X-data improves the interpretation of the model.In the score plot of the developed OPLS-DA model, the samples from both treatment groups were divided in two different clusters, indicating that DOX and CHX show different effect on the examined variables. To confirm model validity, the method of cross-validation was used. The results from the cross-validation were R2X (cum) = 0.527, R2Y (cum) = 0.507 and Q2X (cum) = 0.530, indi-cating a good model.Based on the VIP statistics from the cross-validated OPLS - DA model, statistically significant variables re-sponsible for separation between both treatment groups were extracted. VIP ranks the overall contribution of each variable to the generation of the model. According to the criterion for the VIP statistics, a VIP value > 0.8 was used as a threshold value for determining importance of vari-ables. The variables most strongly influencing the discrim-ination between the DOX treatment group and the CHX treatment group were periodontal pocket depth, AST activ-ity and concentration of the cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a in GCF. The discriminatory variables identified by the OPLS-DA model were additionally confirmed at a univariate lev-el by the non-parametric Mann Whitney U test (P<0.05) which revealed that the DOX treatment markedly de-creased periodontal pocket depth, AST activity and con-centration of the cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a in GCF com-pared to the CHX treatment. The different effects are due to the different mechanism of action of DOX and CHX. DOX possesses anti-inflammatory properties, thus is de-creasing the inflammatory response presented by the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a. This molecule also stabilizes cell membranes, which decreases the activi-ty of intracytoplasmic enzymes, such as AST. ConclusionThe comparative evaluation of the efficacy of the local periodontal treatment with DOX and the local periodon-tal treatment with CHX using the OPLS-DA algorithm re-vealed differences in the therapeutic effects of both treat-ments, at the same time providing insights into their mech-anisms of action. The results from this study suggest that the OPLS-DA algorithm is a valuable tool for comparative evaluation of treatment efficacy.

Cyril and Methodius", Mother Theresa 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* lbogdanovska@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionDoxycycline (DOX), a second generation tetracycline antibiotic, is widely used in the treatment of periodonti-tis. DOX accumulates in gingival fibroblasts and is further distributed in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), a valuable matrix for monitoring concentration of drugs used in peri-odontal treatment (Lavda et al., 2004). Since GCF is ex-creted in low volumes, determination of drug's concentra-tion must be performed using sensitive methods. Applica-tion of HPLC-UV methods for DOX determination in bi-ological samples results in inadequate sensitivity. On the other hand, HPLC methods with fluorescent (FLD) detec-tion provide the required sensitivity and are less affected by interference from other components from the sample matrix (Denic et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2004). The aim of our study was to develop, optimize and val-idate RP-HPLC-FLD method for determination of DOX in GCF and saliva. Materials and methodsReferent standards of DOX, tetracycline (internal stan-dard, IS) and oxytetracycline were supplied by Sigma-Al-drich (Germany). Solvents (methanol and water) were of HPLC grade and reagents (CH3COONa, EDTA disodium salt and CaCl2) were of analytical grade. Whatmann 3MM chromatography paper strips, 2 x 5 mm (Whatman Lab sales Ltd., UK) were used for GCF collection.Calibration standards for determination of DOX in GCF were prepared using serum instead of GCF, in the fol-lowing concentrations: 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, 500 and 1000 ng/mL. For determination of DOX in saliva samples, the concentrations of the calibration standards prepared in saliva were 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, and 500 ng/mL. For both GCF and saliva samples, the concentration of the IS was 1 mg/mL. Methanol: water mixture (50:50, V/V) was used as an extracting solvent.60 patients with chronic periodontitis were assigned in two groups (group I and II). Group I (n=30) received con-ventional short-term orally administered regimen (100 mg DOX, once a day for 21 days). Group II (n=30) received sub antimicrobial dose doxycycline (SDD) regimen (20 mg DOX, twice daily for 2 months). GCF samples were collected from 10 periodontal pockets (pocket depth: 3-5 mm) for 30 s, by insertion of the paper strips in the pock-et and unstimulated saliva samples were collected in sterile containers (- 20 @C until analysis). GCF and saliva samples were collected 7, 15 and 21 days after beginning of thera-py (group I) and 15, 30 and 60 days after beginning of ther-apy in patients from group II. The study protocol was ap-proved by the Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Dentist-ry, Skopje. Before analysis, 50 mL IS working standard solution and methanol: water mixture (50:50, V/V) as an extract-S2 PP 83184Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 183 - 184 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsing solvent was added to each GCF sample up to volume of 500 mL. They were vortex for 30 s and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. For saliva samples, 100 mL of IS working standard solution was added to a 500 mL sample. The extraction solvent (methanol: water mixture (50:50, V/V) was added up to volume of 1000 mL. Saliva samples were vortex-mixed for 30 s and then centrifuged 5 min at 4000 rpm. The HPLC analysis was conducted on Agilent 1200 RR series. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Purospher STAR RP 18e column (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 mm) at 30 @C. The mobile phase consisted of methanol and buffer solution (a mixture of 15 mM CaCl2, 25 mM CH3COONa and 25 mM Na2EDTA, pH=8.1), 50:50, V/V. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/min. DOX and IS were record-ed at 380 nm as excitation (lex) and 532 nm as emission wavelength (lem). 100 mL were injected on the column. The total runtime for the analysis was 10 min. Results and discussionDuring preliminary investigations, mobile phase com-position, lex and lem, flow rate and the volume of injec-tion were optimized. An IS was selected as well. Several mobile phases containing methanol and buf-fer solution were investigated where the organic phase was varied from 20-50% (organic phase/buffer, V/V). The best result was obtained using mobile phase containing 50% methanol and 50% buffer solution (V/V). Mobile phase flow rate was investigated in the range from 0.6-1 mL/min and the final flow rate was set at 0.8 mL/min. The injection volume was tested and it was found that 100 mL was opti-mal for further analysis. DOX fluorescence intensity was estimated using the following lex: 375 nm, 380 nm, 385 nm and lem: 512 nm, 520 nm and 532 nm. The optimal value for the lex and lem were 380 nm and 532 nm, re-spectively. Two compounds were tested as an IS, tetracy-cline and oxytetracyline. Under the optimized conditions, oxytetracycline resulted in poorer peak symmetry and elut-ed early, so tetracycline was selected instead. After the en-tire optimization procedure the retention times for DOX and IS were 5.1 min and 6.5 min, respectively. Method validation was performed according to EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMA, 2011). Selectivity of the method was evaluated by compari-son of blank GCF and saliva samples and spiked samples of GCF and saliva containing DOX and IS. No interfering peaks were found at the retention times of DOX and the IS in both samples, thus method selectivity was confirmed. For GCF samples, linearity was observed within range 20-1000 ng/mL (R2=0.9979). The within- run accuracy and precision ranged from 96.29-112.93% with a coefficient of variation (CV) within the range 2.60-4.66%. The between -day accuracy and precision was within the range from 98.29-104.23 with a CV from 2.32 - 7.05%. The mean ex-traction recovery (94.6-98.77%) confirmed an efficient ex-traction procedure. For saliva samples, linearity ranged from 20-500 ng/mL (R2=0.9965). The with-in run accuracy and precision ranged from 95.30-109.2% with a coefficient of varia-tion (CV) within the range 0.81-4.26%.
