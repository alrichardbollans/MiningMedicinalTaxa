The presence of H. pylori bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract is determined by different invasive and noninvasive diagnostic methods. The invasive strategies are based on endoscopy which can be complemented by histology, urease test or tissue cul-ture to detect bacteria. Non-invasive tests include: anti-body tests (using serum, saliva or whole blood samples) which do not directly detect the presence of H. pylori but rather the presence of an immune response to H. pylo-ri in the form of antibodies. These antibodies may persist even after successful eradication. The antigen tests are per-formed on stool, saliva or urine samples, current interest focuses mainly on the stool antigen test for the detection of H. pylori antigens by an enzyme immunoassay technique. One of the recent advances regarding methodological ap-proaches for diagnosis and monitoring of patients with sus-pected gastric infection with H. pylori is the urease test also termed urea breath test. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date com-prehensive review on the urea breath test as a noninva-sive method, its application and expansive usage for ear-ly detection of infections caused by the H. pylori bacteria, as well as prevention of other progressive illnesses by en-abling prompt eradication of the infection.Studies on the urea breath testThe urea breath test is an accurate, practical and read-ily available test which becomes known as a golden stan-dard when compared to other tests for identification and quantification of H. pylori. Being both specific and sensi-tive, the urea breath test is based on testing the expired air samples collected before and after ingestion of urea con-taining specifically labeled carbon. H. pylori bacteria pro-duce an enzyme called urease that converts urea into car-bon dioxide and ammonia. The carbon dioxide is excreted with the expired air from the lungs and the amount of the labeled carbon dioxide can be measured in the expired air sample, in order to determine the presence of the active H. pylori infection in the stomach and the level of the infec-tion. In order to postpone stomach draining during the ex-amination, a citric acid solution is consumed prior to the test. The lemon acid induces imminent relaxation of the gastric fundus as well as inhibition of the antral motility through biliary reflux. It has been reported that best results can be obtained with expired air samples collected within 10-15 minutes after the urea is consumed (Berger, 2002). The collected samples of expired air can be easily stored for a couple of days at different temperatures.A substantial number of research projects have studied the influence of several factors on the sensitivity and accu-racy of the test. The first studies were focused on the label-ing of the urea used in the breath test.Generally, two meth-ods are being used for labeling the urea-carbon, the first one uses a steady and heavy isotope 13C while the other one uses radioactive isotope 14C (Berger, 2002). It is also possi-ble to label the urea with both 13C and14C but this approach has relative strengths and flows. The radioactive 14C urea breath test can be performed only in hospitals that have nu-clear wards and for some patients a few attempts might be needed in order to produce sufficient amounts of CO2 to change the color of the solution. On the contrary, 13C urea breath test can be used in non-nuclear laboratory set-tings and the samples can be sent for mass spectrometry analysis elsewhere which is a great advantage in compari-S3 PP 141302Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 301 - 302 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsson with the radioactive 14C urea breath test. Furthermore, the small amount of expired air which is needed for analy-sis, makes13C urea breath test ideal for usage (Desroches, 2001). Even though the dose of 14C used in the urease test is very low, it is contraindicated for application in preg-nant women and small children.On the contrary, 13C - urea breath test can be used for the above mentioned groups of patients and is especially useful for testing the pediatric population (Jones et al., 2005).The hydrolysis of the 13C - labeled urea by H. pylori urease in the stomach produces13C02 which is then trans-ported to the lungs, whereby 13C in the expired air is re-vealed by the usage of special equipment. Currently sever-al types of equipment are suggested for evaluation of the 13C expired in air samples: Mass Spectrometry - Isotope Relationship (MSIR), non - dispersive isotope - selective IR spectroscopy (NDIRS) and laser analyzer equipment (LAE) (Parente et al., 2001).The influence of the amount of consumed urea on the accuracy of the urea breath tests has been extensively stud-ied and debated. The oldest tests were performed with 350 mg of urea, later the dose was decreased to 125 mg or 100mg and all tests turned out to be successful.Recent-ly, it was suggested that 75 mg of urea might be sufficient for obtaining reliable results, but later on, it has been con-firmed that an urea dose as low as 50 mg can be used for obtaining more precise urea breath test results.Urease - producing oropharyngeal bacteria can cause falsely positive results of the urea breath test. This problem has been solved by encapsulating the urea for its oral ad-ministration. Considering the advantages, the development of a capsular formulation with 13C urea is an outstanding progress and the most appreciated system for labeled urea delivery. A 50 mg capsule with 13C urea for detection of H. pylori in expired air manifests high sensitivity and distinc-tiveness in clinical conditions (Mattar et al., 2014). Several types of drug treatments are associated with falsely-negative results when using urea breath test. There-fore, antibiotics, bismuth concoctions and proton pump in-hibitors should not be taken within one month prior to the urea breath testing. Also, according to some studies H2- antagonists cause falsely-negative results if administered in high doses. This should be taken into consideration, es-pecially because patients are frequently treated with H2- antagonists before urea breath test is performed.ConclusionsThe UBT is based on the simple principle that a solu-tion of isotopically labelled urea is rapidly hydrolyzed by the abundantly expressed urease of H. pylori. The UBT is a non-invasive, simple and safe test, providing excellent accuracy both for the initial diagnosis of H. pylori infec-tion, confirmation of its eradication after treatment and pa-tients' follow-up. Although definitive standardization of the protocol for UBT isn't currently available, several recommendations could be suggested. It seems prudent to perform UBT in fasting conditions until new data definitively clarify this issue. Citric acid should be used as a test meal, amounts of 75 mg or even 50 mg of urea seem to be sufficient to perform highly accurate UBT. The test can be carried out by different types of equipment, such as IRMS, NDIRS or LAE with recommendation to collect and test two breath samples, one collected before and another collected 10-30 min after urea ingestion. Further studies should be per-formed to justify the cost-benefit ratio for routine applica-tion of this method in the biochemical laboratories.ReferencesBerger, A., 2002.

Macedonia2Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss.Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* suzanaangelova@yahoo.comIntroductionOchratoxin A (OTA) is the most common mycotox-in that can affect human health. The International Agen-cy for Research on cancer (IARC) classifies it as possi-bly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B). This mycotoxin is produced by toxigenic Aspergillus and Penicillium species (Pfohl-Leszkowicz et al., 2007). OTA has been extensive-ly documented as a contaminant of a wide variety of foods including cereals, green coffee, spices, nuts, dried fruits, beer, wine, grapes, and grape juice (Belli et al., 2005). The target organ of OTA is the kidney. However, it has a wide range of other toxic effects, including hepatotoxicity, im-munotoxicity, teratogenicity and neuorotoxicity (Pfohl-Leszkowicz et al., 2007; Sava et al., 2006). Many countries and international organizations have regulated the OTA content in several commodities. The European Commission (EC) has enforced the limits of OTA in cereals and cereal products with the following lev-els: 5.0 ng/g for raw cereals grains, 3.0 ng/g for cereals and cereal products intended for human consumption, 0.5 ng/g for baby food and cereal- based food intended for young children. For the dried vine fruits, soluble coffee and some dried fruits, the EC has set a maximal permissible limit for Ochratoxin A at 10.0 ng/g. Liquid chromatography linked to fluorescence detection (HPLC/FD) was extensively used for OTA confirmatory analysis (Ghali et al., 2009). The aim of this article was to determine concentration of OTA in some foodstuffs collected from supermarkets by liquid chromatography.Materials and methodsChemicals HPLC grade reagents (methanol, acetonitril, glacial acetic acid) and chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). For clean-up purification immuno-affinity columns Ochraprep (R-Biopharm Rhone, Glasgow, Scotland), were used. Ochratoxin A Trylogy, with concen-trations of 10.0 ug/ml in methanol was used as a standard.Commercially available Ochratoxin A, with concen-trations of 10.0 ug/ml in methanol, was used as a stock solution. Ochratoxin A spiking solution contains 2.5 ug/ml Ochratoxin A and Ochratoxin A standard solution (0.25 ug/ml Ochratoxin A). Ochratoxin A working solutions, in concentration ranging from 2.0 ng/ml to 10.0 ng/ml, were prepared by serial dilution of the standard solution.SamplesDuring 2015 year, 57 dried fruits samples including raisins (8), figs (8), dates (5), apricots (5), plumes (10), cranberries (3), cherries (3), pineapples (3), strawberries (2), goji (1), and papaya (1) were randomly collected from local supermarkets. Samples were stored in plastic bags at -200C until the analysis.Sample preparationTo ensure homogeneity before analysis, laboratory samples are normally slurred with water in the ratio of five parts fruit to four parts water, and test materials in this form were used. A test portion, 45 g of fruit slurry, is extracted with a mixture of 50 ml methanol and 5 ml phosphoric acid solu-tion 0.1 mol/L. The extract is filtered, diluted with phos-S3 PP 142304Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 303 - 304 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsphate buffered saline, and applied into an immunoaffini-ty column containing antibodies specific for Ochratoxin A. The Ochratoxin A is isolated, purified and concentrated on the column and then released with elution solvent. Ochra-toxin A is quantified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detec-tion (MKC EN 15829:2011). HPLC conditionsHPLC analysis was performed with Agilent Technol-ogies 1260 Series chromatographic system equipped with vacuum degasser G4225A, Binary Pump G1312B, Auto sampler G1329E, Column Compartment G1316C and Flu-orescence Detector G1321B. Ochratoxin A was separated on ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 Column 4.6 x 100 mm, 3.5 um at room temperature. The mobile phase was a mixture of water:acetonitril:glacial acetic acid (99:99:2, V/V/V). The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the injection volume was 10 ul. Total running time was four minutes. The detection was carried out at and Data were acquired using Agile-nt life Sciences Open LAB CDS ChemStation software.Results and discussionThe described analytical methods effectively separated the Ochratoxin A of all analyzed products. It was observed that under these optimized chromatographic conditions, Ochratotoxin A eluted in less than 5 minutes. The retention time was 3.131 minutes. The calibration curve was set in the range from 2.0 to 10.0 ng/ml using four-point calibra-tion curve. The regression equation was y=0.02198191x +0.0013271 with R2 - 0.99988. The accuracy was 4.7%. The limit of quantification was 1 ng/g. The mean recovery for Ochratoxin A was 86.4%. Laboratory for toxicological chemistry at PHI Cen-ter for Public Health Kumanovo took part in FAPAS Food Chemistry proficiency Test 17150 Ochratoxin A in dried Vine Fruit. Proficiency testing aims to provide an indepen-dent assessment of the competence of participating labora-tories and it is an essential element of laboratory quality as-surance. The performance of the laboratory is shown with z-scores results (-2 <= z <= 2). The result for z-score was at satisfactory level of 1.8.Ochratoxin A was found in two of all analyzed prod-ucts.
