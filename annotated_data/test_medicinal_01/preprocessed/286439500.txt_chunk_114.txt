Gunjan1, Alo Nag2and Chandi C. Mandal1*1 Department of Biochemistry, School of Life Sciences, Central University of Rajasthan, Ajmer, India, 2 Department ofBiochemistry, University of Delhi, New Delhi, IndiaModern treatment strategies provide better overall survival in cancer patients, primarilyby controlling tumor growth. However, off-target and systemic toxicity, tumor recurrence,and resistance to therapy are still inadvertent hurdles in current treatment regimens.Similarly, metastasis is another deadly threat to patients suffering from cancer. This hascreated an urgent demand to come up with new drugs having anti-metastatic potentialand minimum side effects. Thus, this study was aimed at exploring the anti-proliferativeand anti-metastatic potential of colocynth medicinal plant. Results from MTT assay,morphological visualization of cells and scratch assay indicated a role of ethanol andacetone extracts of fruit pulp of the colocynth plant in inhibiting cell viability, enhancingcell cytotoxicity and preventing cell migration in various cancer cell types, includingbreast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, and cervical cancer cell line SiHa,subsequently having a low cytotoxic effect on mononuclear PBMC and macrophageJ774A cells. Our study in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells showed that both ethanol andacetone pulp extracts decreased transcript levels of the anti-apoptotic genes BCL2and BCLXL, and a reverse effect was observed for the pro-apoptotic genes BAX andcaspase 3. Additionally, enhanced caspase 3 activity and downregulated BCL2 proteinwere seen, indicating a role of these extracts in inducing apoptotic activity. Moreover,MDA-MB-231 cells treated with both these extracts demonstrated up-regulation of theepithelial gene keratin 19 and down-regulation of the mesenchymal genes, vimentin,N-cadherin, Zeb1 and Zeb2 compared to control, suggesting a suppressive impact ofthese extracts in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, these extractsinhibited colony and sphere formation with simultaneous reduction in the transcriptlevel of the stemness associated genes, BMI-1 and CD44. It was also found thatboth the plant extracts exhibited synergistic potential with the chemotherapeutic drugdoxorubicin to inhibit cancer viability. Furthermore, GC-MS/MS analysis revealed thepresence of certain novel compounds in both the extracts that are responsible for theanti-cancer role of the extracts. Overall, the results of this report suggest, for the firsttime, that colocynth fruit pulp extracts may block the proliferative as well as metastaticactivity of breast cancer cells.Keywords: cancer, colocynth, cell death, apoptosis, cell viability, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, metastasisFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593297fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 2Chowdhury et al. Colocynth Extracts: EMT and StemnessINTRODUCTIONCancer constitutes a group of deadly diseases that is not onlythe second leading cause of death worldwide, but also largelycontributes to the global health economic burden. The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) has estimated over 14.1 millioncancer cases and 8.2 million cancer-induced deaths worldwidein 2012, and this number is expected to rise catastrophicallyin the coming decades (Torre et al., 2015). Breast and cervicalcancers are the most frequently diagnosed cancers in femalesnationwide, accounting for about 1.7 million new cases and521,900 breast cancer deaths in 2008 (Torre et al., 2015). Indiainfamously boasts of a surmounting 27 and 23% breast andcervical cancer incidence respectively1. Cervical cancer is thesecond most diagnosed cancer and third leading cause of deathsin females, accounting for about 527600 new cases and 265700deaths (Torre et al., 2015).Cancer is predominantly caused due to abnormalities in thegenome (Balmain et al., 2003) and epigenome (Feinberg andTycko, 2004) due to exposure to various damaging agents. Thisset of accumulated cells that has escaped the normal regulatorycontrol mechanisms undergoes unchecked proliferation toform tumors. Despite several advancements in recent years,contemporary anticancer therapy suffers from several limitationsowing to their associated toxicity and off-target effects. Thisprovokes an urgent need to design novel drugs with high efficacyspecific for cancer cells and less toxicity to off-target cells.Phytochemicals have shown promise in this regard as they fitthe above criteria, and their usage in anticancer therapy is anemerging trend.Citrullus colocynth (L.) is a valuable cucurbit plant, widelydistributed in the desert areas of the world, including India,known to possess nutritional values and diverse medicinalactivities, including antibacterial, antifungal, larvicidal andanti-inflammatory properties (Sawaya et al., 1986; Marzouk et al.,2010; Chawech et al., 2017). Literature documents the presenceof many bioactive compounds, such as cucurbitacin, phenolicacids, flavonoids, pyridine and quinolone type alkaloids andfatty acids in fruits of these herbal plants (Hussain et al., 2013,2014; Jeon and Lee, 2014). This plant is traditionally used tocontrol diabetes (Shi et al., 2014). Recent clinical trial studies havewitnessed a fall in fasting blood glucose and Hb1Ac, triglycerideand cholesterol in case of colocynth users (Rahbar and Nabipour,2010; Barghamdi et al., 2016). Intriguingly, a study by Tannin-Spitz et al. (2007) documented cancer specific apoptotic activityof the isolate cucurbitacin, extracted from this plant. However,no study has yet been conducted to explore the effect of colocynthextract in cancer metastasis. Thus, this study was primarily aimedat investigating the unexplored anti-metastatic potential of thisplant extract.This study testified that ethanol and acetone fruit pulpextracts exhibited impressive inhibition of cell viability andcell migration of various cancer cell types, including breastand cervical cancer cells with considerably less effect onmononuclear cells and macrophage cells. Moreover, these pulp1breastcancerindia.netextracts noticeably hindered colony and sphere formationand epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of metastaticbreast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Our GC-MS analysis alsoreveals some unique compounds, which may account for theanticancer activity of the extracts. The current study is thefirst report advocating that fruit pulp extracts containing thenovel compounds may have anti-metastatic potential along withapoptotic activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterialsVerso cDNA synthesis kit (AB1453A, Thermo Scientific), TRIzolReagent (T9424, Sigma Aldrich), Taq Polymerase (MBT060A,Himedia), ready Mix dNTP (MBT078, Himedia), caspase-3antibody (#9661, Cell signaling), BCL-2 antibody (SC-7382,Santa Cruz Technology), actin antibody (A02066, SigmaAldrich), WesternSure-Premium Chemiluminescent substrate(WesternSure-Li-COR-Part No: 926-95000).Cell LinesThe human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 (metastatic) and MCF-7(non-metastatic) cell lines, and cervical cancer SiHa cell linewere procured from NCCS cell repository, Pune, India. J774Acell (Macrophage cell line) was obtained from Dr. Vijay KumarPrajapati, Department of Biochemistry, Central University ofRajasthan, India. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's ModifiedEagles Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovineserum (FBS) (RM1112, Himedia) and maintained at 37*C in ahumidified incubator with 5% CO2.Isolation of Human Mononuclear Cells(PBMC)Mononuclear cells were isolated from human peripheral bloodby using a simple and rapid density gradient centrifugationtechnique using Ficoll-Paque (Sigma-F5414-50ML) methodologyestablished by Boyum (1968) and Boyum (1976). The isolationwas done according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells(0.5 x 105 cells) were seeded in 96 well culture plate in DMEMsupplemented with 10% FBS and incubated for overnight at5% CO2, and treated with increasing concentration (mentionedin other cell lines ) by ethanolic and acetone plant extractsrespectively for 24 h. Blood samples from two healthy volunteerswere taken and mixed before isolation of PBMC. Written consentwas obtained from the participants, and they were informedabout the use of blood in this study. Moreover, the work relatedto blood samples had been conducted by following the regulationof Institutional Ethical Committee at Central University ofRajasthan and, this study was approved by Institutional EthicalCommittee.Plant ExtractsThe plant Citrullus colocynth was obtained from a rural area ofIndia [Jaisalmer (26.9157* N, 70.9083* E), Rajasthan, India]. Thetaxonomic name of this plant had been confirmed by Dr. AmitFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593298fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 3Chowdhury et al. Colocynth Extracts: EMT and StemnessKotia, Department of Botany, University of Rajasthan, India. Thepulp was isolated from fruits, dried and crushed, using a mixergrinder. One gram of dried pulp powder was suspended in 10 mlof ethanol and acetone, followed by solvent extraction at 50*Cfor 72 h. The solvent fractions were evaporated using a rotary-evaporator at 42*C to get the crude products. The crude extractsobtained were then dissolved in ethanol and acetone and kept at-20*C for further use.MTT Cell Viability AssayCell viability was measured by MTT assay (MB186, Himedia)described earlier (Ghosh-Choudhury et al., 2010; Mehta et al.,2015). In brief, cancer cells (5000 cells/well) were seeded in 96well tissue culture plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBSat an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37*C. After 24 h of seeding,cells were separately incubated with different concentrations[25, 100, and 250 ug/ml; equivalent to 1, 4, and 10 ul ofsolvents (ethanol/acetone)] of fruit pulp ethanol extract (PEE)and pulp acetone extract (PAE) for 24 h. Control cells weresimilarly incubated with equal volume of the solvents as in theexperimental wells. At the end of the incubation period, 10 ul ofMTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and the platewas incubated at 37*C for 1 h. The formazan crystals formedwere solubilized by adding DMSO, and subsequently, absorbancewas measured at a wavelength of 530 nm (Studzinski, 1995;Moongkarndi et al., 2004; Ghosh-Choudhury et al., 2010; Mehtaet al., 2015). The effective absorbance was calculated for theexperimental wells with respect to corresponding control wells.LC50 (Lethal concentration at which 50% cells are killed) at 24 hduration was calculated using MTT data set for different cancercell lines (Zhang et al., 2007).Scratch AssayCell migration was determined by scratch assay as describedearlier (Mandal et al., 2010b, 2011b). In brief, cells (2 x 105cells/plate) were seeded in 35 mm tissue culture plates andallowed to grow till they reach 95% confluency. A cell scratch-wound was generated using a micropipette tip, and washed oncewith PBS buffer to remove the floating cells. Cells were thenseparately treated with PEE and PAE (25 ug/ml) for 24 h inexperimental plates, and equal volume of respective solventswas added in control plates. Cells were visualized under aninverted microscope (Carl-Zeiss), and cell migration was assessedby measuring gap sizes in multiple fields and the relative areacalculated using ImageJ, and statistically analyzed (Hirsch et al.,2009).RT-PCR AnalysisTranscript levels of several genes were measured bysemi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis as described previously(Mandal et al., 2010a; Chowdhury et al., 2017). In brief, breastcancer cells (2 x 105 cells/plate) were plated in 35 mm tissueculture plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at anatmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37*C. After 90-100% cell confluencyis reached, the cells were treated with different test factors(such as PEE and PAE (50 ug/ml)) for 24 h. Total RNA wasextracted using TRIzol reagent as described earlier (Mandalet al., 2010a, 2011a, 2016a; Ghosh-Choudhury et al., 2013). Firststand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 ug of total RNAsusing the Verso cDNA synthesis kit, according to manufacturer'sinstruction. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed using thiscDNA as template and gene specific primers in a ProFlex PCRsystem (Applied Biosystem by Life Technologies). The list ofprimers used in this study is given in Supplementary Table S1.Densitometric analysis of the PCR bands was done usingScnImage (Chowdhury et al., 2017).Western Blot AnalysisMethodology of western blotting has been described previously(Chowdhury et al., 2017). In brief, cells were seeded at a densityof 2 x 105 cells/plate in 35 mm tissue culture plates. Cells weretreated with different test factors and harvested after 24 h oftreatment. Protein extraction was carried out in RIPA buffer andsubsequently, cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 x g at 4*Cfor 20 min.
