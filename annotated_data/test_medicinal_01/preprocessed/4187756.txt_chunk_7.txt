What these documents have had in common is a stake on whether or not and, if so, how best to organise and regulate the practice and use of herbal medicine. In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology's report on 'Complementary and Alternative Medicine' from 2000 has been central, as have various documents from the National Institute of Medical Herbalists, the Herbal Medicine Regulatory Working Group, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency, Department of Health, the European Herbal Practitioners Association, and the Prince of Wales's Foundation for Integrated Health. It has been immensely helpful speaking to herbalists Nina Nissen and Ned Reiter about ongoing processes of professionalisation. For a historical contextualisation of these regulatory initiatives I have relied heavily on work by Griggs (1997), Saks et al. (1992) and Porter (1989). In Vietnam, legislative proposals and regulations from the Ministry of Health, the Communist Party and the Association of Traditional Practitioners concerning the practice of traditional medicine have been key. While in Vietnam, I learned a great deal from speaking to traditional practitioners Tran Khuong Dan and Hoang Bao Chau, as well as to Director Trinh Van Lau of the National Institute of Drug Quality Control, Professor Tran Van Hien at the National Institute of Traditional Medicine, and Dr. Bui Thi Bang at the Institute of Materia Medica. For a historical contextualisation of recent initiatives to regulate traditional medicine I have relied on the work of Hoang et al. (1999), Huu (2003), Thompson (2004), Monnais-Rousselot (2002), and Guenel (2005). Efficacy: The second grouping of empirical material can be further divided into two sub-groups. Firstly, those archival anthropological texts which have allowed me to explore how the evolutionary anthropology of the 19th century came to be challenged by a social and cultural anthropology in the 20th century have been crucial to my analysis of the 'efficacy' 58 of herbal medicine in Vietnam and the UK. Throughout the time I have spent researching Vietnamese and British herbal medicine I have consistently run into the contention that there is more to illness and healing than biology and physiology. As a part of unpacking this contention I decided to focus on those anthropological texts which have contributed to the building up of a theory of symbolic (as opposed to physiological) efficacy. To do this, I have tried to read Rivers, Ackerknecht, Evans-Pritchard, Levi-Strauss, Turner and others in the same way that Canguilhem read Broussais, Bernard, Comte and Bichat, to locate the concepts that have made a theory of symbolic efficacy tenable. Secondly, I have also focused on toxicological, pharmacological and clinical efforts to validate the safety and efficacy of the two herbal remedies I have chosen to focus on, St. John's Wort and Heantos. This includes historical data on the uses of these medicinal plants, descriptions of them in the herbals and treatises of herbalists, scientific data on their phytochemistry, clinical efficacy trial protocols and results, as well as pharmacologic mechanism-of-action data. To facilitate this task, I have had the great fortune of spending many hours in the laboratories of the Institute of Chemistry in Hanoi, where Professor Tran Van Sung and his colleagues took great time to explain their work to me. In Germany, I had the opportunity to visit the Leibniz Institute of Plant Bio Chemistry, where Professor Ludger Wessjohann and Dr. Katrin Franke gave me a detailed overview of their work with Heantos. In Frankfurt, I visited the laboratory of Professor Walter Muller at the Biocenter of the University of Frankfurt, who provided me with an in depth background of his and his colleagues' work on the pharmacology of St. John's Wort. On the clinical side, I spent many a day at the Hoa Binh Treatment Centre for Drug Addiction, as well as Hanoi's Central Psychiatric Hospital in Vietnam. In Europe, I visited the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy where a randomised controlled trial on Heantos is under preparation. I also benefited from a visit to speak with Dr. Klaus Linde in Munich at the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research who has worked with St. John's Wort. Life: The final grouping of materials concerns the kind of life that herbal medicines are understood to promote, optimise and perpetuate. In particular I have chosen to focus on how herbal medicine has come to be seen as enhancing both the longevity and the quality of life of its users, including how it is described as providing them with a 'story' or a cognitive framework through which to come to terms with their conditions and their lives. As a result, this grouping of empirical material has included texts written by herbalists to 59 explain their healing practices, texts by public health officials, reports from Ministries of Health, medical anthropology/sociology monographs, as well as a good portion of self-help literature and consumer guides written for and by users of herbal medicine. While this part of the analysis has been largely documentary, for the sections in which I describe the vitalist theories of Vietnamese and British herbal medicine I have benefited greatly not just from the writings of herbalists, but also from speaking to traditional practitioners Hoang Bao Chau and Tran Khuong Dan in Vietnam and herbalists Ned Reiter and Nina Nissen in the UK. Notwithstanding this firm empirical grounding, as already pointed out, I make no pretensions that what I describe in the following constitutes the history of herbal medicine in the two countries I have chosen; there is much more to herbal medicine in Vietnam and the United Kingdom than I will be covering in the coming chapters. Having said that, it is of course my obligation to demonstrate how those avenues of investigation and sites of empirical analysis that I have chosen to pursue are cardinal to the practice and use of British and Vietnamese herbal medicine today. Consequently, I would much rather consider this current work as a series of what Foucault (1991) has called 'game openings' highlighting a number of sites, tactics and strategies that have been involved in the mobilisation of herbal medicine in both countries. Each thematic I have chosen to focus on - quackery, efficacy, life - deserves a monograph in itself, in both countries. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the game openings that my comparative analysis set out do tell us a great deal about what the optimisation of life requires today. 60 3 Transformations in quackery It is surely the quack who stands as one of the most controversial, problematic, if not colourful figures of modern medical history. Whether peddling miracle tonics throughout the countryside, coaxing desperate patients into improvised backstreet surgeries or diatribing medical establishments for their theoretical and therapeutic fallacies, the 'quack' has been a consistent target of highly contested public health protection strategies in the past few centuries. Campaigns against the quacks, charlatans, mountebanks, cranks, and hucksters of medicine in Britain go back at least as far as the 16th century when the kingdom's first Parliament Act regulating the practice of medicine was passed in 1512, not least as a response to the "great multitude of... common artificers, smiths, weavers and women, [that] boldly and accustomably took upon them great cures, to the high displeasure of God, great infamy of the faculty and the grievous hurt, damage and destruction of many of the King's liege people" (cited in Griggs 1997: 56-57). In Vietnam, highlighting longstanding tensions between Northern (Chinese) and Southern (Vietnamese) medicine, the renowned late 19th century writer Nguyen Dinh Chieu called for the punishment of those 'quacks' who strayed from or distorted the medical teachings of Chinese medicine, including village healers who relied on family remedies, insufficiently trained acupuncturists, Southern medicine practitioners who combined Northern and Southern remedies, as well as Taoist priests and Buddhist monks who promoted superstitious healing practices (cited in Marr 1987: 174). Common to these controversies has been a suggestion to ban, exclude or limit the medical practice of those deemed to be damaging rather than improving the health of individuals as a measure of public health protection. In the past two hundred years or so, public health protection strategies in both Vietnam and the United Kingdom have increasingly embraced dividing practices as a means of separating the competent from the incompetent, the genuine from the pretender, the regulars from the irregulars, or the doctors from the quacks. Needless to say, the history of such dividing practices reads as a succession of divisive attempts to agree upon and define boundaries of therapeutic competence. In the United Kingdom, the 1858 Medical Act is often highlighted as a landmark in recent medical history as it stipulated new educational requirements for those wishing to register themselves as medical practitioners with a General Council of Medical Education and Registration (later the General Medical 61 Council) chiefly because, "it is expedient that Persons requiring Medical Aid should be enabled to distinguish qualified from unqualified Practitioners" (Great Britain. Parliament. 1858). Its enactment is widely seen as having dealt a decisive blow to what had otherwise been a thriving therapeutic plurality at the time, where the university-educated physicians, apprentice-trained surgeons and licensed apothecaries of the urban centres were far outnumbered by the midwives, herbalists, folk healers, bone-setters and barber-surgeons who catered for the health needs of the, especially rural, majority (see Porter 1989; Saks 1992). In Vietnam, the opening of the Hanoi School of Medicine in 1902 to train local "auxiliary doctors" and the subsequent launching of an Indigenous Medical Assistance programme in 1905 by French colonial administrators were described as important civilising initiatives in the face of "a resistance to the penetration of western medical science... due to the ancestral habits of a population attached to its traditional medicine" (cited in Monnais 2006). These early 20th century events are seen as having been pivotal to the emergence of the kind of hierarchies of medical authority which persist to this day in Vietnam (see Monnais-Rousselot 2002; Thompson 2004). In this chapter, I will show how the relatively recent births of traditional, alternative and complementary medicine are once again transforming the ways in which public health is to be protected from 'quackery' in Vietnam and the United Kingdom. Importantly, I will be arguing that the renaissance and revival of traditional and alternative medicine (including herbal medicine) in these two countries is not so much leading to a diminishing of dividing practices as to an internalisation of dividing practices. In particular, as various traditional, complementary or alternative forms of medicine have been integrated or mainstreamed into public health delivery, their practitioners are increasingly being called upon to help the public distinguish between the competent and the incompetent within a plurality of different forms of medicine. Consequently, just as Porter (1989) argued that the mid- to late-19th century professionalisation of medicine in Britain resulted in a 'quackery with a difference', I will argue that we are once again in the midst of such a transformation. And while there are important differences between the United Kingdom and Vietnam in the ways in which this transformation is unfolding, we will also see how there have been a number of convergences in the ways in which the protection of the public from dangerous practitioners has been organised. 62 What follows, then, is an analysis of how the problem of quackery - damaging rather than beneficial medical practice - is being posed and addressed today in these two countries, as well as of how distinctions between "safe" as opposed to "dangerous" medical practice are being made and what effects these dividing practices are having. It is important to underline the ideologically-drenched nature of the term 'quackery' itself. Indeed so negative are its overtones and so controversial are its historical associations with many of the therapies and treatments which today are considered traditional, alternative or complementary, that one would be hard-pressed to find it used in contemporary Vietnamese or British legislative proposals, practitioner association statutes or consumer awareness programmes. Yet, as we will see, each of its historical definitions - intentional deception for financial or other personal gain, over-selling or puffing (quacking) of abilities, dangerous belief (however well-intentioned) in esoteric ideas about healing, incompetent practice resulting from insufficient or outdated skills - remains crucial in ongoing efforts to regulate the practice of medicine in Vietnam and the United Kingdom. As a result, what I will demonstrate is how banning, excluding or limiting the medical practice of those deemed to be damaging rather than improving the public health remains just as salient today as it was in the 19th century as a strategy of public health protection. It is the way in which the problem has come to be posed that has changed. In order to carry out such an analysis, I will be covering a wide range of legislation, policy documents, TMCAM practitioner association proposals, parliamentary committee investigations, as well as expert reports from international organisations in both countries. I will also point to similar initiatives in other countries of the world to highlight the global form that medical practice and regulation takes today. The point of this chapter is not to argue that the experiences of Vietnam and the United Kingdom have been homogenous, indeed we will see plenty of instances where this has categorically not been the case. Rather, what I will demonstrate is that whatever the particularities in forms and circumstances of medical regulation, one can certainly identify a common point of departure in contemporary efforts to regulate traditional, alternative and complementary medicine in these two countries - i.e. how best to safeguard and promote public health in a situation of 'medical pluralism'. 63 Quacks and quackery in the golden age of biomedicine As a number of scholars have demonstrated, from the 19th century onwards nation after nation has pursued a strategy of what has been termed 'medical professionalisation' in the name of protecting their citizens from the life-threatening dangers that unqualified practitioners and untested medicines pose.17 And, while there is of course plenty of polemic surrounding the extent to which today's established medical professions have in fact altruistically worked to protect and promote public health (and if so whether they have actually succeeded in doing so), what these 19th century efforts to organise medicine did initiate was an entire medical machinery (and industry) bent on distinguishing 'good' from 'bad' medicine and on separating those who can heal from those who cannot. Setting educational standards for practitioner qualifications; approving ethical codes for medical practice; creating and controlling registers of those who will be allowed to call themselves/ act as medical practitioners; reviewing any inconsistencies in the performance of registered practitioners with the possibility of excluding them; restricting what kinds of medicinal claims can be made; setting safety and efficacy standards for any medications that are to be licensed for sale; and issuing consumer guidelines for the appropriate use of medicines. All are instances of the kinds of dividing practices that have emerged around the modern regulation of medicine. Underlying such regulatory practices are assumptions about what kinds of expert knowledge and skills are requisite for those practicing 'good' or 'proper' medicine, what constitutes ethically responsible conduct on the part of practitioners, as well as what kinds of evidences are required to validate safety and efficacy claims. And for this very reason, it is this medical machinery that has had everything to do with the drawing up of boundaries between conventional, alternative and quack medicines as we know them today. The new Academies, Associations, Colleges and Councils of Medicine that appeared throughout Europe and America during the 19th century, quickly spreading to the colonies, were legally presented as important parts of an urgent quest to sort the qualified from the unqualified in an otherwise dangerously liberal and lucrative market for nostrums, herbal remedies and treatments. According to a number of social historians of medicine, it was 17 For individual accounts of the very different processes of national medical professionalisation in the 19th and 20th centuries see, for example: Australia (Willis 1983), America (Berlant 1975), Great Britain (Peterson 1978), Germany (McClelland 1991), The Netherlands (Schepers and Hermans 1999), France (Ramsey 1988), China (Hillier and Jewell 1983), India (Arnold 1993) and Vietnam (Hoang, et al. 1999). 64 this enactment of legislation aiming to limit the practice of medicine to a certain defined group of practitioners coupled with the concurrent development of a laboratory-based form of scientific medicine that would mark the beginnings of a so-called 'golden age of biomedicine'. From this moment onwards, state-sanctioned biomedical monopolies ultimately separated biomedically competent practitioners from especially non-biomedical practitioners who were often charged with being dangerously unqualified (Cooter 1988; Inglis 1964; Johnston 2004; Saks 1995; Starr 1982; Wallis and Morley 1976; Willis 1983). Interestingly, around the same time that such state-sanctioned medical professions were consolidating themselves, a number of medical movements ranging from homoeopathy, acupuncture, hydropathy, medical botany, osteopathy to mesmerism also began taking off throughout the United Kingdom, Europe and America (see Brown 1982; Cooter 1988; Darnton 1968; Porter 1989; Saks 1992). Common to the proponents of these movements, and what made them different from the hucksters and snake oil vendors, was a reasoned conviction that allopathic medicine, with its 'poisonous' drugs and 'mechanistic' view of the individual, had got it all wrong. As Porter (1989: 231) has put it: Each of these movements proclaimed itself to be in possession of a more subtle understanding of the true nature of disease as an integral part of the active processes of nature. Each offered a new plan of life based upon Nature's way and claimed to use more natural modes of healing - drawing upon herbs alone, or pure water, or (as with homoeopathy) infinitesimal quantities of the purest drugs. Importantly, it was not scientific medicine as such that was being challenged by these medical movements, rather it was the 'flawed' conclusions of established medicine about the nature and cause of health and disease - homoeopathy, medical botany, osteopathy, mesmerism and hydropathy were not anti-science movements. Darnton (1968), Wrobel (1987) and Cooter (1988) have all shown how the rallying of professional medical organisations around a particular form of scientific medicine based on germ and cell theory in the latter half of the 19th century was not as self-evident as one might think.
