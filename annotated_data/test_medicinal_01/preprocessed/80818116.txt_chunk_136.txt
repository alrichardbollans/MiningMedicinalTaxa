The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) classifies CKD into five stages according to estimated glomerular filtration rate. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been usually estimated based on equation that incorporates serum creatinine concentration (SCR) along with demographic data and it is measured in ml/min per 1,73m2: the first stage has GFR >90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and the second one between 60-89 ml/min/1.73m2, while stages 3, 4 and 5 are being characterized with GFR 30-59, 15-29 or <15 ml/min/1.73m2, respectively.Based on CKD stage disease individualization of therapy is required especially for drugs which are mainly eliminated through urine and/or have narrow therapeutic index. Other conditions which may required individual dosage regimen are also: application of nefrotoxic drugs, conditions which may lead to development of chronic renal disease as hypertension, diabetes mellitus etc. Furthermore, severe hepatic dysfunction is usually accompanied by some renal impairment (hepato-renal syndrome). Reduced renal excretion has been reported in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class C) for a number of drugs mainly eliminated by renal excretion in unchanged form. Calculated creatinine clearance (CLCR) based on serum creatinine concentration is the most convenient method to estimate GFR as it requires only a single blood sample. As serum creatinine is so highly dependent on age, gender, and body size, a number of formulas and corrections have been developed to estimate the muscle mass and assumed creatinine production (Verbeeck and Musuamba, 2009).One of the oldest method for GFR estimation in adults is Cockcroft-Gault formula: GFR(ml/min/1.73m2)=[140-age(y)xbody weight(kg)]/SCR(mg/dL)x72] multiplied with 0.85 if the patient is women. Estimated creatinine clearance may be calculated also based on Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulas. MDRD1 formula beside the concentration of creatinine in serum requires additional information as urea concentration in serum, Cu in mg/dL and albumin concentration in serum, alb in g/dL and it is given as: GFR=170xSCR exp(-0.999) x age exp(-0.176) x (0.762 for women) x (1.180 for black) x Cu exp(-0.170) x alb exp(0.318). However, MRDR2 formula requires only serum concentration level i.e. : GFR=186xSCR exp(-1.154)xage exp(-0.203)x(0.742 for women)x(1.212 for black). Moreover, for patients whose GFR is over 60 ml/min/1.73m2 it may be calculated by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation which is considered to give more precise estimation: GFR=ax[SCR(mg/dL))exp(c)/b]x[0.993 exp(age)] where a is for white race 141 for male and 144 for female, and in the black race 163 for male and 166 for female, b is 0.9 for male and 0.7 for female and while c is -0.411 if serum creatinine levels is <0.9 mg/dL and -1.209 if serum creatinine levels is >0.9 mg/dL in male or -0.329 if SCR is <0.7 mg/dL and -1.209 if SCR levels is >0.7 mg/dL in female. If the patient is overweight/obese (BMI >25 kg/m2 according to WHO), Salazar-Corcoran method should be used: GFR is estimated as GFR=[(137-age)x(0.285xbody weight(kg)]+12.1xheight(m)xheight(m)]/[51xSCR(mg/dL)] in male while in female patients the estimation is given as GFR=[(146-age)x(0.287xbody weight(kg)]+9.74xheight(m)xheight(m)]/[60xSCR(mg/dL)]. In children, Schwartz adjusted method is used for estimation of renal impairment degree i.e. : GFR=[kxheight(cm)]/SCR(mg/dL) where k=0.33 for pre-term newborns age under 1 year, k=0.45 for full term in-S6 PP 266558Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 557 - 558 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsfants age<1, k=0.55 for children age 1-12 and girls in pu-berty and 0.7 for boys in puberty (age >12). If the children are obese, Leger (Leger et al., 2002) formula is being ap-plied: GFR=[56.7xbody weight(kg)+0.142xheight(cm)xheight(cm)]/[88.4xSCR(mg/dL)]. GFR can alternatively be calculated based on the serum concentration of cystatin C. Cystatin C, is a small, nonglycosylated basic protein, produced at a constant rate which renal elimination occurs only by glomerular filtration with no tubular secretion, and only minimal extrarenal elimination. The blood concentration of cystatin C depends almost entirely on the GFR and is not substantially affected by diet, nutritional status, or inflammatory or malignant diseases. If cystatin C is being determined by PENIA method GFR can be estimated as: GFR=80.35xcystatin C(mg/L)-4.32, while if it is determined by PETIA method GFR should be calculated as GFR=86.49xcystatine C(mg/L)-1.68(x1.384 for children <14) (Chew et al., 2008). Once the GFR is determined, individual dosage regimen in patient with chronic kidney disease can be applied based on the following formula: D*=DxQ where D is the maintenance dose for patient with normal renal function, D* is maintenance dose for patient with renal impairment and Q is being calculated as Q= fnonr + frx(CLCR*/CLCR) i.e. Q=(1-fr) + frx(CLCR*/CLCR) where CLCR is clearance creatinine in patient with normal renal function and CLCR* is the calculated clearance creatinine for the patient who requires individual dosage regimen, fr is the fraction of drug eliminated by urine and fnonr is the drug fraction eliminated extrarenal. The normal range of GFR, adjusted for body surface area, is 100-130 ml/min/1.73m2 in men and 90-120 ml/min/1.73m2 in women younger than the age of 40 and in pharmacokinetic calculations for CLCR it is usually used 100 ml/min/1.73m2. In children, GFR is 110 ml/min/1.73m2 until 2 years of age in both sexes, and then it progressively decreases. Hence when new dose is being calculated in patient with renal impairment and in comparison with ones who have normal renal function CLCR=110 ml/min/1.73m2 is being used for children under the age of 2 and 100 ml/min/1.73m2 for older (Doogue and Polasek, 2011).ReferencesChew, J.C., Saleem, M., Florkowski, C.M., George, P.M., 2008.

Bonchev 9, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria* lulzime.ballazhi@unite.edu.mkIntroductionIt has been known for many years that coumarins have versatile structure, significant therapeutic potential and are present in many natural therapeutic products (Riveiro et al., 2010). They have multiple biological activities, including anticoagulant (Mousa, 2002), anti-inflammatory (Hadjipavlou-Litina et al., 2007), antimicrobial (Nimavat et al., 2009) and anticancer activities (Belluti et al, 2010). In search for new chemotherapeutics against based on coumarin we have synthesized eight compounds that combine coumarin core and izoxazoles or thiazoles in hydrazinyldiene-chroman-2,4-diones (Jashari et al., 2014; Ballazhi et al., 2014; 2015). Three of the eight compounds, 3-[2-(1,3-thiazol-2-yl)hydrazinylidene]chroman-2,4-dione (1), 3-[2-(4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)hydrazinylidene]chroman-2,4-dione (2) and 3-[2-(4,5-dimethyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)hydrazinylidene]chroman-2,4-dione (3), have been shown to have most potent antiproliferative effects and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Jashari et al., 2014) and bone and lung metastatic cell lines from breast cancer (Ballazhi et al., 2015). In addition, synergistic effects of tamoxifen (Ballazhi et al., 2014) and doxorubicin (Ballazhi et al., 2016, submitted for publication) with these compounds were evaluated and apoptotic effect was confirmed. These compounds were further subjected to physicochemical characterization. In this study their distribution coefficients (logD) in three pH environments were evaluated and compared with the anticipated ones from different software packages. Materials and methods4-Hydroxycoumarine (4-HC, reference), n-octanol and the compounds for preparation of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), NaH2PO4, NaOH and KH2PO4, were purchased from Merck KgaA (Germany). The tested compounds were synthesized by the procedure previously described (Jashari et al., 2014; Ballazhi et al., 2015). The experimentally obtained distribution coefficients (logDexp) between n-octanol and phosphate buffers (pH 7.4, NaH2PO4-NaOH, 0.15 M, I = 0.397 M; pH 6.8, NaH2PO4-NaOH, 0.15 M, I = 0.397 M; and pH 5.8, Na2HPO4-KH2PO4-NaOH, 0.15 M, I = 0.6, temp. coef. -0.0028/oC) were determined by shake-flask method (Ballazhi et al., 2016, submitted for publication). The experiments were performed in the systems n-octanol : PBS = 2:1; 1:1; 1:2 (vol), in triplicate. The mixtures of the organic and aqueous phase containing the compounds were shaken on a mechanical shaker for 2 h (shake-water bath, Haake, 25+-0.1 oC). After equilibration, they were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm, the n-octanol phase was removed and in both phases the concentrations of the compounds were assayed spectrophotometrically (UV/VIS Perkin-Elmer System, USA) at lmax 290 nm for 4-HC and 410-420 nm for the tested compounds. The logDexp were calculated as the ratio between molar S6 PP 267560Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 559 - 560 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsconcentration in n-octanol and aqueous phase. All experiments were made in triplicate. The logD7.4exp values were compared with the calculated ones (logDcalc) obtained by ChemAxon's software (www.chemicalize.org/), Vega NIC (www.vegaNIC.com), ChemDraw (www.cemistry-software.com), vcclab (www.vcclab.org)-ALOGPS 2.1 and molinspiration (www.molinspiration.com). Results and discussionThe logD7.4exp, logD6.8exp and logD5.8exp values de-termined for monobasic acid 4-HC were in accordance with the literature data as well as the partition coefficient of the un-dissociated 4-HC in pH 7.4, logP 2.66, which is similar to the value 2.37 determined by van der Gies-sen and Janssen (1982). When n-octanol/PBS ratio was 1:1, the logD7.4exp ranged between -0.065+-0.003 (1) and 0.957+-0.038 (3), logD6.8 between 0.153+-0.001 (1) and 0.996+-0.008 (3) and logD5.8 between 0.894+-0.011 (1) and 1.886+-0.018 (3). Small differences and the same tenden-cy were observed between the corresponding logDexp when determined in systems with different n-octanol/PBS ra-tios. Large discrepancy was noted between logD7.4exp and logD7.4calc values. However, when a simple regression was performed, there was found a strong correlation between the logD7.4exp and logD7.4calc (0.986<=R<=0.999). Depend-ing on the software used, predictions are composed of the molecules' atomic increments, selected atom types to ac-commodate electron delocalization and addition of con-tributions of ionic forms. logD of zwitterions is calcu-lated from the logD at the pI. Also, the effect of hydro-gen bonds on logD is considered if the formation of a six membered ring between suitable donor and acceptor at-oms can take place. As the logD values are pH-dependent, the logD calculation relies on the pKa prediction process. Considering data determined in the study, the smallest difference was observed when software package VegaN-ic was applied (1.189<=D(logD7.4calc-logD7.4exp)<=1.527 for 4-HC; 0.682<=D(logD7.4calc-logD7.4exp)<=1.096 for 1; 0.814<=D(logD7.4calc-logD7.4exp)<=1.393 for 2; 1.075<=D(logD7.4calc-logD7.4exp)<=1.488 for 3), which is based on two well-known molecular descriptors: ALogP (hydrophobicity contribution of 120 atom types) and MlogP (13 structural parameters). The large discrep-ancy between the predicted and experimentally determined values suggests that the structures of the coumarin deriva-tives in the aqueous phase and/or in the organic phase are significantly different from the assuming structures. One of the reasons could be the tautomeric behavior of these compounds.ConclusionDistribution coefficients of novel coumarin derivatives in different pH mediums were determined. The derivative having thiazole moiety with additional methyl groups attached to the carbons at the positions 4 and 5 (3) showed the highest lipophylicity. Further studies are needed for complete physico-chemical and PK/PD characterization of the synthesized compounds.
