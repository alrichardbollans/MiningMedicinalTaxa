The food shall be compared to foods that do not have a composition, which allows them to bear a claim, including foods of other brands. The difference in the quantity of a nutrient and/or the energy value shall be stated, and the comparison shall relate to the same quantity of food. 1184The Scientifi c Committee on Food Safety and Animal Health has in its Guidance Document of December 2007 defi ned more precise rules for comparative nutrition claims. "Same category" means that products are similar in terms of nutritional content1185. "Dairy products" is too wide a category as milk and cheese cannot be compared but "Milks" can be compared with other milks, and "cheeses" with other cheeses.1186It should be noted that the claim "contains" could also be interpreted as a health claim. The Committee Guidance states that while the claim "contains" is normally a nutrition claim, in some cases the use of the term "contains" refers to "groups of substances with a specifi c functional effect". In such cases, the "contains" claim is a health claim and must be authorised accordingly.1187 Regardless of whether "contains" claims are judged as nutrition claims or health claims, the general requirements on claims apply. This means that the substance subject to the claim is present in a signifi cant quantity and has been shown to have a benefi cial 1178 A claim stating that the content in one or more nutrients, other than vitamins and minerals, has been increased, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where the product meets the conditions for the claim "source of" and the increase in content is at least 30% compared to a similar product.1179 A claim stating that the content in one or more nutrients has been reduced, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where the reduction in content is at least 30% compared to a similar product, except for micronutrients, where a 10% difference in the reference values as set in Directive 90/496/EEC shall be acceptable, and for sodium, or the equivalent value for salt, where a 25 % difference shall be acceptable.1180 A claim stating that a product is "light" or "lite", and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, shall follow the same conditions as those set for the term "reduced"; the claim shall also be accompanied by an indication of the characteristic(s) which make(s) the food "light" or "lite".1181 Where a food naturally meets the condition(s) laid down in this Annex for the use of a nutritional claim, the term "naturally/natural" may be used as a prefi x to the claim.1182 This guidance for given in the December 2007 Guidance by the Scientifi c Committee on Food Health and Animal Health, page 7.1183 This means the marketer cannot choose a suitable product against which to make the comparison.1184 Regulation 1924/2006 EC, Article 9.1185 Scientifi c Committee Claim Guidance 2007, 7.1186 Scientifi c Committee Claim Guidance 2007, 8.1187 Scientifi c Committee Claim Guidance 2007, 11.-214-nutritional or physiological effect. One also has to keep in mind that the use of any claim triggers the nutrition labelling requirement discussed above in chapter 5.2.1.3.1188The Guidance gives examples of "contains" claims that are interpreted as nutrition claims and "contains" claims that are interpreted as health claims. A claim is a nutrition claim if in the naming of the substance or category of substances, there is only factual information, for example: "contains lycopene", and "contains lutein".1189A claim is a health claim if in the naming of the substance or category of substances, there is a description or indication of functionality or an implied effect on health. For example "contains antioxidants" will be interpreted as a health claim, because the function is an antioxidant effect. "Contains probiotics/prebiotics" will be interpreted as a health claim, because the reference to probiotic/prebiotic implies a health benefi t. "With prebiotic fi bres" or "contains prebiotic fi bres" will be interpreted as health claims, because by using an adjective, they describe a nutrient or a substance and thus refer to functionality.1190The distinction between a nutrition claim and a health claim does not seem clear after all. It is diffi cult to separate between substances the mentioning of which does not imply any function, and the mentioning of which does. After all, many nutrients and substances have necessary and thus benefi cial functions in the body, and the advances in nutritional science keep providing us with more and more information on these diet-health connections. This might lead to a situation where mentioning any nutrient will be considered a health claim and the need for a legal concept such as 'nutrition claim' will cease to exist.5.3.3.5 Health Claims5.3.3.5.1 General Requirements for the Use of Health Claims"Health claim" means any claim that states, suggests or implies that a relationship exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health1191. "Reduction of disease risk claim" is a subcategory of "health claim". It means any health claim that states, suggests or implies that the consumption of a food category, a food or one of its constituents signifi cantly reduces a risk factor in the development of a human disease1192.Health claims are prohibited unless they A) comply with the general requirements for claims (for example the nutrition profi le), B) comply with the specifi c requirements for health claims, C) are authorised in accordance with the Regulation, and D) are included in the lists of authorised claims.1193 There are two authorisation routes and lists for claims. The list of established claims will be created according to Article 13, and a list of novel claims pursuant to Article 14. The authorisation procedures for including claims on the lists are stipulated by 1188 Scientifi c Committee Claim Guidance 2007, 11.1189 Scientifi c Committee Claim Guidance 2007, 11.1190 Scientifi c Committee Claim Guidance 2007, 11.1191 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 2(2)(5).1192 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 2(2)(6).1193 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 10(1).-215-Articles 15, 16, 17 and 18. These procedures will be discussed above in detail. Article 19 concerns modifi cation, suspension and revocation of authorisations1194.When using health claims, one must always provide the consumer with additional information. Health claims shall only be permitted if the following information is included in the labelling, or if no such labelling exists, in the presentation and advertising:a statement indicating the importance of a varied and balanced diet and a healthy (a) lifestyle;the quantity of the food and pattern of consumption required to obtain the claimed (b) benefi cial effect;where appropriate, a statement addressed to persons who should avoid using the food; (c) andan appropriate warning for products that are likely to present a health risk if consumed (d) to excess.1195It is prohibited to use health claims suggesting that health could be affected by not consuming the food1196. Reference to general, non-specifi c benefi ts of the nutrient or food for overall good health or health-related well-being may only be made if accompanied by a specifi c health claim included in the Community lists.1197National rules on recommendations of national associations of medical, nutrition or dietetic professionals and health-related charities may apply in the absence of specifi c Community rules1198. It is prohibited to use claims making reference to other associations, and claims making reference to recommendations of individual doctors or health professionals1199.There is also one particular claim type that is prohibited: claims that make reference to the rate or amount of weight loss1200. Commission Directive 96/8/EC on dietetic foods for weight reduction had previously prohibited this type of claims. It was considered appropriate to extend this restriction to all foods. See chapter 5.2.1.4. on marketing of dietetic products.Other controversial claim types such as psychological and behavioural claims were not prohibited but it was clearly stated that scientifi c substantiation is required to back up these 1194 The applicant or a user of a claim included in the lists may apply for a modifi cation of the relevant list. The regular procedures for claim approval apply. Modifi cation, suspension and revocation of authorised claims can be initiated by the EFSA, a Member State of the Commission. The EFSA shall issue an opinion on whether a health claim included in the lists still meets the conditions laid down in the Regulation. It shall transmit its opinion to the Commission, the Member States and, where relevant, to the original applicant of the claim in question. The Authority shall make its opinion public. The applicant/user or a member of the public may make comments to the Commission within 30 days of such publication. The Commission shall examine the opinion of the Authority and any comments received as soon as possible. If appropriate, the authorisation shall be modifi ed, suspended or revoked in accordance with the Committee procedure.1195 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 10(2).1196 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 12(a).1197 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 10(3).1198 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 11.1199 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 12(c).1200 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 12(b).-216-claims1201. This means for example that claims stating "refreshing", "helps you concentrate", "helps you sleep" cannot be used without fulfi lling all the requirements for health claims. Claims related to children were also not prohibited. This was another controversial issue. Instead, claims were subject to a more stringent Article 14 procedure.5.3.3.5.2 'Function' ClaimsArticle 13 of the Regulation creates the authorisation procedure for health claims other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children's development and health. These are health claims describing or referring to:the role of a nutrient or other substance in growth, development and the functions of (a) the body; orpsychological and behavioural functions; or(b) slimming (c) or weight-control or a reduction in the sense of hunger or an increase in the sense of satiety or the reduction of the available energy from the diet1202.The European scientifi c community has started to call these health claims "function" claims1203. These claims are legal without product-specifi c authorisation, if they are on the Community list of established claims. Claims can only be included in the list if they are:based on generally accepted scientifi c evidence; and(i) well understood by the average consumer. (ii) 1204These types of claims can be such as: 'ingredient A of this product promotes bowel movement', 'compound B reinforces bones', 'raw material C refreshes' and 'raw material D of the product increases the sense of satiety and supports weight control'1205.The Commission shall adopt, in accordance with the Committee procedure, a positive Community list of well-established claims by 31 January 2010 at the latest.1206 This list of permitted claims will include all the necessary conditions for the use of these claims. Before the adoption of the list by the Commission, the EFSA will evaluate the scientifi c evidence of the claims. The claims on the list may be used on a label as long as they are proven to apply to the food in question.It is not an easy task to produce the list of established claims. By 31 January 2008, Member States had to submit to the Commission a list of claims approved at national level. This 1201 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, preamble 24. "There are many factors, other than dietary ones, that can infl uence psychological and behavioural functions. Communication on these functions is thus very complex and it is diffi cult to convey a comprehensive, truthful and meaningful message in a short claim to be used in the labelling and advertising of foods. "1202 Without prejudice to Directive 96/8/EC.1203 See presentations at NHClaims Congress in Naantali, Finland 7 - 9 November 2007, http://congress.utu.fi /NHC2007/presentations.php.1204 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 13(1).1205 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland. Page 4.1206 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 13(3).-217-means claims that are based on generally accepted scientifi c evidence and well understood by consumers, and thus deemed acceptable by national authorities. The national list of claims shall be accompanied by the conditions applying to the claims and by reference to the relevant scientifi c justifi cation.1207 The Commission received similar proposals from all the 27 EU Member States by the beginning of 2008. This means the EFSA and the Commission will have 2 years, beginning in 2008 when the national reports arrive, to compile the EU list.To predict what the Community list will look like, we now take a look at the contents of the Finnish list. The Food Safety Authority1208 and the Ministry of Trade and Industry produced the Finnish list. Health claims are widely used in Finland, but previously there has not been a national list of accepted claims. The Authority collected information on health claims by using a questionnaire on its web page1209. Disease risk reduction claims were not included; as they are a separate issue, see below. A total of 625 questionnaires were returned by the deadline. Preliminary results of the replies were presented and discussed in a seminar held in December 2006. The fi nal report of the study was presented to the Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry in January 2007. The Finnish proposal for acceptable claims and the relevant scientifi c justifi cation will be sent to the Commission by the Ministry of Trade and Industry at the beginning of 2008. 1210The Finnish report, a 316-page document of applicable health claims1211 is based on the information received from entrepreneurs, and includes numerous scientifi c references. Based on this data, the Finnish authorities prepared their list and sent it to the Commission. If we look at the Finnish report, we can understand the challenge faced by the EFSA and the Commission. We can also fi nd out the most popular claims and the products that typically generate these claims.Consequently, half of the foodstuffs declared were food supplements and about half were conventional foodstuffs1212. This means that from a marketing point of view, health claims are equally important to functional food and food supplement businesses. There were altogether 269 substances or combinations of substances, pertaining to which claims were presented1213.Of the different categories of Article 13 claims, claims describing the role of a nutrient in growth, development and/or the functions of the body represented 88% of the claims. Psychological and behavioural claims made up 5% and weight-loss claims 7% of the total. The last group includes 1207 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 13(2).1208 In Finnish: Elintarviketurvallisuusvirasto, Evira.1209 The internet questionnaire was on the Evira web page from March 2006 until August 2006, and again in October 2006 because of several inquiries. 1210 Food Safety Agency web page at: http://www.evira.fi /portal/en/food/current_issues/?id=349.1211 Information on what types of product are used in the claims, and on the scientifi c justifi cation on which the claims are based according to the respondents, can be found in the detailed Finnish report (Vaihia K. - Sarlio-Lahteenkorva S.: Selvitys Suomen elintarvikemarkkinoilla kaytettavista terveysvaitteista. Eviran julkaisuja 8/2007, 316 pages, available at: http://www.palvelu.fi /evi/fi les/55_519_486.pdf. Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland. (English summary, 146 pages) available at: http://www.palvelu.fi /evi/fi les/55_519_492.pdf.1212 Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland, 10.1213 We need to remember that this fi gure includes only health claims that are not related to reduction of disease risk or children's development. Nutrition claims and medicinal claims are naturally also excluded from this fi gure.-218-claims that relate to slimming, weight control, a reduction in the sense of hunger, an increase in the sense of satiety, or a reduction of the available energy from the diet.1214The claims are typically used at least in labelling and advertising. Health claims were used on labels in 96% of the cases, and in brochures or advertising in 99.7% of the cases. Claims are also frequently used in expert material (86% of the cases), and also with other marketing channels such as fairs or product presentations (54%).1215Health claims were made in relation to a total of 269 different compounds, foodstuffs and ingredient combinations. Almost every product had some kind of scientifi c evidence to back up the claim. Only 4 of 625 claims were not based on any kind of science. The scientifi c evidence backing the claims varied in type. Evidence ranged from clinical trials of the product itself (22%) to clinical trials of a corresponding product (53%) to research of the ingredient (65%). Half of the claims were also backed up by general textbook information.1216 All in all, the Finnish claims seem to have a fairly sound scientifi c basis. This information could predict that most of the Finnish claims will be accepted and established by the Community list.The Finnish claims were classifi ed using the PASSCLAIM project classifi cation1217. However, there were also claims, which did not fi t into any of the Passclaim categories. The Passclaim categories are the following:Diet-related cardiovascular disease1. Bone health and osteoporosis2. Physical performance and fi tness3. Body weight regulation, insulin sensitivity and diabetes risk4. Diet-related cancer5. Mental state and performance6. Gut health and immunity.7. 1218The greatest number of claims was related to cardiovascular health, especially to cholesterol and blood pressure.
