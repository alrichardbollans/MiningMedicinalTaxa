From infancy to puberty, serum creatinine concentration uniformly increases, depending on the skeletal muscle development.In the elderly, the kidney concentrating ability is decreased, which results in reduced creatinine clearance. This is due to a decreased urinary creatinine excretion as a result of reduced lean body mass rather than to renal dysfunction. Plasma urea concentration and urinary protein excretion increase with age. In addition to differences in gender specific hormones, differences also exist in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters. Plasma concentrations of amino acids, urea, uric acid and creatinine are higher in males than in females. Clinical chemistry analytes are greatly influenced by diet and drinking. A high-protein diet increases plasma urea, serum cholesterol, and phosphate concentrations. In contrast, starvation, fasting and malnutrition also induce clinically significant changes in analytes concentrations. Long-term starvation entails decreased concentrations of blood protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins, and urea. On the other hand, the concentrations of creatinine and uric acid increase. Urinary excretion of ammonia and creatinine is increased, whereas the excretion of urea, calcium and phosphate is reduced. Due to the decreased skeletal mass, serum concentrations of urea and creatinine as well as creatinine clearance are reduced. Hemolysis can cause an interference factor for the analysis of creatinine. Also, bilirubin can cause false positive results in creatinine determination.ConclusionFrom this data for creatinine, with the usage of the t-test, we can conclude that there are significant differences in results between different age groups and gender, but there is no significance in results for urea for participants with age of 50-65 in both male and female groups.The inter-individual variations for creatinine are 15,64% and for urea are 26,94%. The range of variability in serum creatinine between individuals in this study is between 61,57-100,4 umol/L for male participants and 50,9-82,66 umol/L for female, but according to the kit documentation creatinine levels should be 62-106 umol/L for male and 44-80 umol/L for female. For urea this range is between 2,08-7,64 mmol/L (2,6-6,5 mmol/L by the kit documentation).It is of great importance that physicians be aware of these factors, because the final interpretation of the analyses and decisions on therapeutic procedures based on this interpretation actually lead to the physician's final judgment. In this process, the laboratory should act as a reliable and consistent collaborator.ReferencesHosten, O.A., 1990.

Worldwide urine screening tests use for preliminary re-sults of opiate abuse for employees in the workplace, ath-letes in doping control and etc. (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Lum and Mushlin, 2004). However, existing problem in interpreting the results of opiate urine analysis arises be-cause immunoassays screening tests have high sensitivity but lower specificity because of cross-reactivity with sub-stances other than the drugs in question (Lum and Mush-lin, 2004). Therefore, it is well known that positive opi-ate results may be obtained during drugs of abuse screen-ing related to certain drugs and food intake (EFSA, 2011; Jankovicova et al., 2009; Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Lum and Mushlin, 2004). Seeds of the opium poppy plant are legally sold and widely consumed as food. Morphine and codeine are nat-urally occurring substituent of the poppy plant, Papa-ver somniferum. The opiate content of poppy seeds var-ies greatly and is dependent on the seed origin and meth-od processing (EFSA, 2011; Samano et al., 2015). Due to contamination during harvesting, the seeds can contain morphine and other opiate alkaloids (Lachenmeier et al., 2010). Literature data and our previous case study indi-cate that consummation of both, raw poppy seeds and bak-ing mixtures, induce positive immunoassay test for opiates (Dukic-Cosic et al. 2014; Jankovicova et al., 2009; Sama-no et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2014). However, the time pe-riod during which it is possible to obtain false positive opi-ates results is not yet sufficiently understood.The purpose of this case study was to determine time period of presence of opiates in urine after the consump-tion of product which contain poppy seed using immuno-assay test and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) technique. Materials and methodsFemale participant age between 20 and 25 years with-out previous known history of substance abuse provided written informed consent to participate in this case study. Participant consumed a piece of strudel with poppy seeds from a local bakery in the morning on the first day and collected ad libitum each urine sample during next three days. Urine samples (n=8) were collected 5, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours after strudel ingestion. Specimens were analyzed with the Opiates Test Card (MP Biomed-icals, LLC, California) immunoassay at 300 ng/mL cut-offs, and all positive samples were quantified for morphine and codeine by LC/MS. Urine specimen was prepared us-ing liquid/liquid extraction of opiate by mixture of chloro-form and isopropanol (9 : 1; v/v). Extracts were analyzed by LC/MS technique: separation column Waters Spheri-sorb 5 mm, ODS2, 4.6 x 100 mm; mobile phase: ammo-nium acetate:acetonitrile (80 : 20; v/v), mobile phase flow rate 0.3 mL/min; mass detection range: 100-400 m/z.S3 PP 154328Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 327 - 328 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe screening immunoassay test for opiates (cutoff 300 ng/mL) was positive for all investigated urine samples. These results in accordance with previous studies that pop-py-seed food products, such as poppy-seed strudels, may cause a true-positive immunoassay screening test for opi-ates due to the presence of low, but still detectible, levels of opium alkaloids (Lum and Mushlin, 2004). The morphine content in poppy seeds from around the world is variable (0.1-294 mg/g), and exposure concentrations depend on poppy seed origin, harvesting procedure and the method of poppy seed foodstuffs preparation (Samano et al., 2015; Thevis et al., 2003). Significant reductions in opiate con-tent have been documented after food preparative process-es, with decreased drug concentration shown after wash-ing, soaking, grinding and baking (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Samano et al., 2015). To minimize the number of positive opiate tests resulting from poppy seed consump-tion, cutoff concentration for morphine and codeine raised from 300 to 2,000 ng/mL (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Sa-mano et al., 2015). However, only screening immunoassay test for opiates with lower cutoff (300 ng/mL) are avail-able in our country. In all investigated urine samples, morphine and co-deine concentrations were determined by LC/MS. The following values were obtained for morphine: 0.25, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02, 0.01 and 0.01 mg/L, and codeine 0.07, 0.09, 0.06, 0.02, 0.009, 0.008, 0.001, 0.001 mg/L, re-spectively. The highest measured concentration of mor-phine and codeine was obtained at 5 and 12 hours, respec-tively. This is in agreement with literature data that peak concentrations of morphine and codeine appeared 4-12 hours after consumption of poppy seed (Lachenmeier et al., 2010). However, for interpreting urine opiate results need to know that measured concentrations of morphine and codeine after the consumption of products which con-tain poppy seed are noticeably lower then concentrations of opiates which can be measured in urine of opiate abus-ers. Furthermore, presence of heroin metabolite 6-mono-acetylmorphine can be detected in urine of opiate abusers using LC/MS or GC/MS techniques (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Samano et al., 2015). In contrast to results of this case, the most studies with intake of poppy seeds, raw and cakes, shows that urine samples were negative by 20 hours after consumption (Jankovicova et al., 2009; Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014). Present data show that, even 72 hours after the oral intake of strudel containing poppy seeds, the urinary level of opiate alkaloids can be detectible. Namely, approx-imate detection time of opiates of abuse in urine is up to three days and these data demonstrated that opiates can be detected in urine after consumption poppy seed stru-del during the same time period as in users of psychoactive substances. Thevis et al. (2003) also demonstrated positive opiate urine at 48 h after consumption a typical poppy seed cake with high morphine content (151.6 mg/kg). The con-sumption of poppy seed products in those out-of-competi-tion time spaces might be considered as non problematic, but the long length of stay of opiates in urine samples can lead to positive doping results in competition tests up to three days after oral intake of cakes with poppy seeds (The-vis et al., 2003; Lachenmeier et al., 2010). ConclusionThe results of the present case study support previous findings and confirm that opiates can be detected in urine after consumption popular poppy seed strudel. However, these data indicates that time period of presence of opiates in urine can be prolonged after consumption of this prod-uct. This finding should be taken into account in routine testing of employees in the workplace, members of the mil-itary, students in schools, as well as athletes.

Capitata) is a vegeta-ble crop, economically important in Republic of Macedo-nia. In nutrition, it is used in fresh or processed state.Dobricevic et al. (2006), have determined the chem-ical composition of 100 g of cabbage, where the amount of vitamin C ranges from 20 to 100 mg/100 g, dry mat-ter content from 5% to 9%, fiber 1.0% to 1.7%. Accord-ing to Rumeza et al. (2006), the water content in cabbage was 92%, protein 1.6%, fat 0.2%, carbohydrates 4.8%, ash 0.6%, Ca 52 mg/100g and P 44 mg/100g. The energy val-ue is 24 kcal/100 g. Vitamin C which is contained in the cabbage has antioxidant effect, it protects the human body from stress, and it is a cofactor in several vital enzymat-ic reactions (Cauniietal, 2010). According to Gjorgjev et al. (2008), the content of Ca and P in cabbage is in pro-portion that contributes to a better use of these micronu-trients for growth and development of the organism. There are also the following elements: K, Na and Cl, and the trace elements: Cu, Zn, Co and Mn (Lambasa, 2006). Cab-bage contains a significant amount of aromatic substanc-es and organic acids, which give the typical taste and smell (Gjorgjev et al., 2008). Fresh cabbage has healing proper-ties when treating stomach ulcer, protects mucous mem-branes, strengthens the immune system against many dis-eases, increases hemoglobin in the blood and cures anemia, affect the normalization of blood pressure, cures rheuma-tism, reduces the risk of colon hose etc (Vlahovic, 1999).During the drying process on appropriate temperature, free water evaporates which preserves the stability of the product from microbiological and chemical aspect. The content of water in the dried vegetables ranges from 8 to 12%. At the same time, it the concentration of sugars and other ingredients is increased (Katalinic, 2006).
