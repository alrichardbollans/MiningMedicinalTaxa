What I hope to have shown in this chapter is that insisting on fundamental incommensurability would make the task of accounting for the emergence of Heantos and St. John's Wort as two herbal treatments for addiction and depression respectively in the 1990s almost impossible. At best, one would have to conclude that Heantos and St. John's Wort are but the latest casualties of modernity's incessant drive to rationalise, commodify, industrialise and colonise 'nature'. What I have described as the disciplining of herbal medicine would no doubt be read by some as nothing short of such a 'scientific colonisation', an erosion of tradition - 'if there has been a revival or renaissance of herbal medicine in Vietnam and the United Kingdom, then it has come at the dear cost of a lost 188 authenticity, legitimacy and epistemology'.112 If this is the case, then how should we understand the efforts of Vietnamese health officials, doctors, scientists and traditional practitioners alike to "build our own medicine", the decision by Tran Khuong Dan to don a white lab coat, or the clinical trials currently being carried out to test the efficacy of different traditional remedies in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City? And how should we read the literature on St. John's Wort by British herbalists which easily incorporates both neuropharmacologic findings and vitalistic concepts into accounts of the efficacy of this plant in the treatment of mood disorders? Have they all been co-opted, forced to 'sell out' in the face of market pressures or foreign donor 'interests'? And are St. John's Wort and Heantos all the worse for it? Whatever the verdict, what I have shown in this chapter is that, notwithstanding the antagonisms that clearly do divide herbal medicine and modern medicine, there does seem to be some kind of common ground at stake - how to account for, consistently ensure and even improve the efficacy of St. John's Wort and Heantos. This is not to say that there has been full agreement on these central problems, this much should be clear from the foregoing analysis. Yet, just as there can be disagreement between herbal and modern medicine practitioners, so too can there be diverging hypotheses amongst herbal practitioners or between pharmacologists. Moreover, just as pharmacological concepts of biological regulation have informed accounts of the efficacy of herbal medicines, so too have herbal concepts of 'synergy' or 'polypharmacy' informed possible routes of pharmacological investigation. The importance of producing full spectrum extracts of St. John's Wort, as well as sticking to a multiple pot extract of Heantos (rather than breaking Heantos down into each of its plants), has been underscored rather than undermined in German and Vietnamese pharmacology and chemistry laboratories. As we have seen then, the search for plausible mechanisms of action relies on an assemblage of concepts, objects and norms which taken together can account for the workings of life. It is a domain where a politics of 'life itself' circulates as pharmacologists, herbalists, phytochemists, neuroscientists and clinicians attempt to identify its mechanisms and understand its workings, so as to be able to attend to its pathologies in the form of dysregulations, disruptions, blockages or breakdowns. Moreover, it is a domain 112 See Janes (1999) for a rigorous demonstration of this argument in the Tibetan context. 189 characterised by multiple hypotheses about these mechanisms, some of them characterised as vitalistic and holistic and others as mechanist and reductionist, all of which insist on a plausibility of their own. Yet, in mapping out the routes to prominence that St. John's Wort and Heantos have followed in the past two decades, it is clear that neuropharmacological pathways have featured prominently in media accounts, marketing information and also self help literature, although we will be seeing in the next chapter how vitalistic accounts of the workings of herbal remedies in terms of 'renourishing nervous systems' or 'rebalancing Yin and Yang' remain in full circulation in these same accounts. In the following and final chapter of analysis, I will turn my attention to a much more recent debate concerning a kind of neo-vitalism which, as we will see, is linked not to a politics of 'life itself', but rather to a politics of 'human subjectivity itself'. 190 7 Petty engineers of modern life Today we are concerned with a different kind of hazard that lurks in our environment - a hazard we ourselves have introduced into our world as our modern way of life has evolved. The new environmental health problems are multiple - created by radiation in all its forms, born of the never-ending stream of chemicals of which pesticides are a part, chemicals now pervading the world in which we live, acting upon us directly and indirectly, separately and collectively... [This] 'sea of carcinogens'... casts a shadow that is no less ominous because it is formless and obscure, no less frightening because it is simply impossible to predict the effects of lifetime exposure to chemical and physical agents that are not part of the biological experience of man. Silent Spring, Rachel Carson, 1962 World medicine has made great progress in the last few years and our doctors have been longing to have the most modern methods in treating the sick. This is a legitimate desire, but I must admit that our efforts have not concentrated on this aspect... Western medicine remains powerless before many diseases while certain treatments not yet accepted officially have proved to be efficacious. Minister of Health in Vietnam, Pham Ngoc Thach, 1965 The true miracle of modern medicine is diabolical. It consists in making not only individuals but whole populations survive on inhumanly low levels of personal health. Medical nemesis is the negative feedback of a social organization that set out to improve and equalize the opportunity for each man to cope in autonomy and ended by destroying it... turn[ing] people into unfeeling spectators of their own decaying selves. Limits to Medicine, Ivan Illich, 1976 The newly emerging social problems [arising from] industrialization and modernization such as environmental pollution, social evils and changes in lifestyles... are exerting an adverse impact on people's health; income differences among the people are posing big challenges to the assurance of equity in diagnosis and treatment of diseases; the seamy side of a market economy involves the risk of eroding the noble ethics of the physician. Resolution on the protection, care and promotion of people's health in the new situation, Communist Party of Vietnam, 2005 If life expectancy and population statistics in Vietnam and the United Kingdom are anything to go by, then it cannot be said that 'a modern way of life' is killing people in any kind of general sense. By most estimates, the vast majority in these two countries have experienced dramatic advances in longevity over the past century or so. At the beginning of 191 the 20th century, a child born in the United Kingdom had an estimated average life expectancy of about 47 years compared to about 77 for a child born today - "people are living longer than ever before" (Great Britain. Department of Health. 2004: 9). In Vietnam, the estimated longevity leap has been from around 35 to 70 and "[a]lthough the country is among the poorest in the world, its vital health indicators are comparable to those of middle-income countries" (WHO 2003: 2). Both countries have seen their populations explode in this same period, from 38 to 60 million in the UK and 16 to 80 million in Vietnam. While such numbers certainly disregard the impoverished misery of millions,113 and there is much debate over just what factors can be said to account for these advances (public hygiene, modern medicine, traditional medicine, nutrition, vaccination, urban planning or the treatment of water and sewage), it seems that over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries the life mechanisms of Vietnamese and British individuals and populations came to be worked upon, protected and perhaps even enhanced in ways that have allowed for increasingly longer lives. At the same time, as discussed in the introduction to this dissertation, by the middle of the 20th century, doubts were regularly being voiced as to whether processes of industrialisation, technologisation, bureaucratisation and rationalisation were in fact exerting a purely positive influence on peaceful life. Notwithstanding measurable advances in a range of life indicators (death rates, infant mortality rates, maternal mortality rates, life expectancy), it seemed that this newfound longevity had come at a cost. In becoming mundane, modern living, it was argued, had spawned a range of debilitating side effects in the form of a dehumanising alienation and an enfeeblement of the body's biological life mechanisms via pollution and toxins. Even if the optimisation of biological processes was allowing people in countries like the UK and Vietnam to live longer, they were at the same time being zombified into "unfeeling spectators of [their] own decaying selves", marooned in "states of unthinkable backwardness", and left exposed in "unbreathable air, polluted streams" and a growing chemical "sea of carcinogens [as]... toxic materials become lodged in all the fatty tissues of the body", while also subjected to the painfully "addictive, mutilating and mutagenic" side effects of modern pharmaceuticals (Carson 1962: 213, 170; 113 For example, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health has estimated average life expectancy in the rural province of Lai Chau at 63 years compared to 75.7 in the capital Hanoi, while in the UK people born in Glasgow city can expect to live to 69.3 years compared to 80.8 years in East Dorset (Great Britain. National Statistics. 2005; NCSSH 2001). Health inequalities are a major public health issue in both countries. 192 Galbraith 1958: 192, 194; Illich 1976: 154, 28; Nguyen, et al. 1965: 3). These were, as Armstrong and Caldwell have put it, the "dilemmas of social progress" (2004: 362). Dilemmas that were also highlighted in 1965 by Vietnam's Health Minister who argued that "although we still have to solve many problems related to under development, we are already beginning to cope with problems arising in a modern society" (Pham 1965: 21). In these kinds of modernisation critiques it was not so much that modern living was killing people off - although this argument certainly continues to be put forward in situations where pollutants and toxins are directly or indirectly held responsible for human fatalities, where lifestyles are charged with retarding a nation's life expectancy advances, as well as in terms of a looming ecological threat to man's future on this planet - rather what emerged out of these various critiques was a new component of life, which it was argued had been hitherto neglected by a 'cold' and reductionist modernisation: our 'quality of life'.114 This chapter is about the concept of 'life', more specifically about how different understandings of it have come into circulation in contemporary efforts to heal with herbs in Vietnam and the United Kingdom. In recent years, late 20th century developments within the life sciences, especially biotechnology, have led a number of social theorists to look at how what Foucault (1978) termed 'bio-power' is currently being refigured by so-called frontier technologies such as genetics, tissue engineering, neuroscience or cloning, as they remake 'life itself' through technique thus making it 'artificial' (see Franklin, et al. 2000; Rabinow 1999; Rabinow and Rose 2006; Rose 2001; Shiva 1997). While this work has generated considerable insight into the transformations that these developments are making possible, an almost exclusive focus on the frontier technologies of biomedicine and biotechnology has come at the cost of other accounts of what life is and how it works, however subjugated or scientifically discredited. The 'politics of life itself' in Vietnam and the United Kingdom is not somehow exclusive to the different expert forms of knowledge that are loosely referred to as the bio-sciences, rather as I will show, socio-economic, epidemiological as well vitalistic problematisations of what life itself is and how it might be optimised are equally relevant. Secondly, I will also argue that the series of alienation and life-enfeeblement critiques of modernisation processes that I have described in the foregoing chapters have provided 114 For illuminating discussions concerning the origins of the concept of 'quality of life' in both a social and a medical context see Armstong and Caldwell (2004), Basu (2004) and Wood-Dauphinee (1999). 193 conditions for a kind of neo-vitalistic reconfiguring of modern life. That is to say, not only has bio-power created conditions in which it becomes possible to discipline, optimise the capacities of, and extort the forces of (and more recently also to enhance) biological bodies and populations. It has also allowed for these same tasks to be performed on human subjectivities as part of overall life-administering operations aiming to optimise both longevity (understood as corporeal life) and 'quality of life' (understood as the ways in which individuals experience, cope with, take advantage of and enjoy their corporeal lives) in Vietnam and the UK (cf. Armstrong 2002; Armstrong and Caldwell 2004). In this way, 'life itself' and 'human subjectivity itself'115 have become equally crucial objects of bio-power in these two countries today, whether operating through herbal or modern medicine health interventions. Just as a politics of life itself has during the course of the past few centuries brought "life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations... ma[king] knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life" (Foucault 1978: 143), I will argue so too has a politics of human subjectivity itself brought subjectivity and its mechanisms into a realm of explicit calculations through hitherto unprecedented psychological,116 sociological, and anthropological efforts to map these subjectivities out in both their individual and collective forms. Thirdly, I will demonstrate how it is exactly in the intersections between life itself and human subjectivity itself - between longevity and quality of life - that we can locate the recent revival and renaissance of herbal medicine use in both Vietnam and the UK.117 In the latter half of this chapter I will show how herbal medicine use has come to be problematised and acted upon in very different ways in the two countries under scrutiny 115 The distinction between 'life itself' and 'human subjectivity itself' I owe in part to Szerszynski, although his use of it pertains to a discussion about a 'postmodern form of sacrality' which he suggests is characterised by a "plurality of meanings grounded in individual subjectivities" (2005: 82). For Szerszynski, human subjectivity itself should be understood as "internal capacities for creating meaning and coherence" (ibid. : 172). I suggest that this is but one possible understanding of human subjectivity, an understanding that relies heavily on the anthropological concept of symbolic efficacy. 116 For empirical accounts of how the psy-sciences have contributed to the mapping out of individual psy-universes, making them both amenable and available to technical interventions to improve mental aptitudes, discipline, skills and concentration in the UK see especially Rose (1996b; 1999). 117 In this connection we should note that it has been pointed out that today: "a growing number of medical technologies are employed to improve the looks, performance, and psychological well-being of people who are healthy. Over the past decade or two we have seen the development of Paxil for shyness, Rogaine for baldness, Viagra for impotence, Provigil for sleepiness, Adderall for poor concentration, Meridia for excess weight, Botox for wrinkled faces, Humatrope for short stature and Sarafem for premenstrual discomfort" (Elliot 2005). Neuropharmacology is another obvious site in which the politics of life itself and human subjectivity itself converge (see Rose 2003; Vrecko 2006), just as has been the case with the placebo effect (see chapter 5). 194 here. While there has been a focus on empowering individual herbal users into taking care of their selves as responsible health consumers in the United Kingdom, the comprehensive mobilisation of Vietnamese herbal medicine has been as much a strategy of national cultural revival as a programme of individual or public health promotion. Importantly, I will argue that sociological and anthropological styles of reasoning have permeated these efforts as it is not only the vital capacities of Vietnamese and British bodies that are targeted by herbal remedies, it is also the coping skills, self esteem, cognitive frameworks, awareness and human capabilities - all components of human subjectivities - of herbal medicine users that are simultaneously targeted. That is to say, following Rose (1996b: 86-7), I will argue that just as psychology has been a 'generous' discipline allowing "psychological ways of thinking and acting... to infuse the practices of other social actors such as doctors, social workers, managers, nurses, even accountants", so too have sociological and anthropological ways of thinking and acting. As disciplines, sociology and anthropology have actively contributed to the making up and managing of 'whole person' subjectivities. And, in both countries, I will show how herbal medicine has, in very different ways, been harnessed to counteract some of the many damaging effects on human subjectivities that have been attributed to modernity. Modernisation, epidemiologic transition and disrupted vital energy flows In the UK, 21st century bio-politics has importantly come to be framed in the context of what a recent Public Health White Paper highlighted as a 20th century transition from infectious to chronic diseases as the main causes of death; a move into what Omran (1971) called the 'Age of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases'. As a result, it is argued in the White Paper that since "the big infectious killer diseases have [now] been eradicated or largely controlled" mortality and morbidity in the UK have instead come to be inseparably linked to "lifestyle" (Great Britain. Department of Health. 2004: 6). If people are living longer than ever before then, as Porter has put it, there is "more time for illness, and... greater effort and resources will need to be devoted to keeping well" (1999: 710). In Vietnam, while health authorities are keen to highlight that today "most of the general health indicators of our country surpass other countries with the same per capita income" (Vietnam. Communist Party of Vietnam. 2005), they also concede that the nation is currently in the middle of an epidemiologic transition and that "the health system... has not adapted itself to [these] changes in disease patterns" (Vietnam. Ministry of Health. 2001).
