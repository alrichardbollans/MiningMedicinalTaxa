Endothelial function was improved regardless oftraditional risk factors or inflammatory markers, and, even amodest increase in serum lycopene, further impaired endothelialfunction in atherosclerotic patients (Gajendragadkar et al., 2014).One conclusion of the mentioned study was that lycopene affectsespecially smaller vessels, such as resistance arteries, rather thanlarger vessels, as measured arterial stiffness remained unalteredin all study participants (Gajendragadkar et al., 2014).Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV)Kim et al. reported an independent, inverse association betweencirculating lycopene and brachial pulse wave velocity in 264healthy women, regardless of age, body mass index, smokingand drinking habits, menopause, blood pressure, beta-carotene,alpha-tocopherol, markers of oxidative stress, and inflammation(Kim et al., 2010; Table 1). Reduced oxidative LDL changes mayhave an important contribution to arterial stiffness reductiondue to lycopene (Kim et al., 2010). Another study, including126 healthy men revealed the benefits of lycopene on oxidativestress and endothelial dysfunction, especially in subjects with anFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521112Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthTABLE 1 | Effects of lycopene on endothelial function and arterial stiffness.Number of participants Methodology Results, conclusions References36 statin treated cardiovascularpatients (mean age: 67-68years) and 36 healthy volunteers(mean age: 61-68 years)Double-blind trial: 7mg lycopene or placebodaily for 2 months.Lycopene supplementation improvedendothelial function in patients withcardiovascular disorders on optimalsecondary prevention, but not in healthypersons.Gajendragadkar et al.,2014225 overweight volunteers, aged40-65 yearsParticipants were randomly assigned into 1 of 3dietary intervention groups: control diet (lowtomato content), a high-tomato-content diet, ora control diet with addition of lycopenecapsules (10 mg/d) for 12 wk. Collected bloodsamples were tested for carotenoid and lipidprofiles and inflammatory markers. Arterialstiffness and dietary intake were alsomonitored.A relatively high daily consumption oftomato-based products (32-50mglycopene/day) or lycopene supplements(10 mg/day) was ineffective in reducingconventional cardiovascular risk markers,inflammatory markers, markers of insulinresistance and sensitivity, lipid profile andarterial stiffness in moderately overweight,healthy, middle-aged individuals.Thies et al., 201225 study participants, mean age:27 +- 8 yearsRandomized, intervention model, crossoverassignment.

Endothelial functionwas assessed by reactive hyperemia peripheralarterial tonometry. Plasma superoxidedismutase was used to assess oxidative stress.An inverse correlation between serumlycopene levels and arterial stiffness wasfound. An increased serum lycopenedecreases oxidative stress, which mightinfluence endothelial function.Kim et al., 2011264 healthy women, 31-75 years The relationship between serum lycopene andbrachial-ankle pulse wave velocity wasassessed.An independent, inverse relationshipbetween circulating lycopene and brachialPWV was observed.Kim et al., 2010impaired endothelial function (Kim et al., 2011). After 15 mg/daylycopene supplementation, for 8 weeks, Kim et al. reported adecrease of systolic blood pressure and high sensitivity C reactiveprotein (Kim et al., 2011).The main biological mechanism by which lycopene reducesthe risk and mortality of the metabolic syndrome, includethe antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiobesity effects, theability to improve endothelial function, glycemic control, insulinsensitivity and lipid profile (Tsitsimpikou et al., 2014; Liet al., 2015; Han et al., 2016a,b). An inverse relationship wasfound by Yeo et al. between lycopene level and brachial-anklepulse wave velocity (Yeo et al., 2011). PWV was significantlyhigher in patients with metabolic syndrome, with lower thanmedian serum lycopene values (<=0.0294 mmol/l) compared topatients without metabolic syndrome; no statistically significantdifferences between the 2 groups were found when lycopenelevels were high (Fantin et al., 2010; Yeo et al., 2011).Higher serum carotenoid levels were associated not just witha lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, but also withfewer abnormal metabolic syndrome components. A significantassociation between lycopene and the metabolic syndrome wasdescribed only for normal-weight and overweight participants,but not in obese patients, according to a study enrolling 13,196subjects, probably related to an increased oxidative stress anddecreased antioxidant ability, due to sequestration of lycopenein the adipose tissue and more important inflammation in obese(Han et al., 2016b). On the other hand, daily tomato juiceintake reduced waist circumference, cholesterol, and monocytechemotactic protein-1 (inflammatory adipokine) and increasedadiponectin (anti-inflammatory adipokine) levels in 30 young,healthy Taiwanese females (Li et al., 2015). Lycopene was shownto impair pro-inflammatory cytokine production, such as IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF-a, preventing insulin resistance (Gourantonet al., 2011).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521113Mozos et al. Lycopene and Vascular HealthL-arginine or L-citrulline supplementation modulate thearginine-NO pathway, enabled by multiple cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate-dependent pathways, with importantprophylactic and therapeutic contributions in the metabolicsyndrome (Jobgen et al., 2006).A large study, including 225 middle-aged, overweightvolunteers reported no changes of conventional cardiovascularrisk factors, inflammatory tests, insulin resistance and sensitivity,lipid profile, oxidized LDL, von Willebrand factor, and arterialstiffness after high daily intake of lycopene, despite goodcompliance (Thies et al., 2012). One week of lycopenesupplementation increased plasma lycopene, but not biomarkersof vascular oxidative stress and inflammation, or biomarkers ofnitric oxide (plasma nitrate/nitrite) in healthy, active subjects,suggesting that the participants already possessed a robustantioxidant capacity and lycopene provided no additional benefit(Denniss et al., 2008).Intima-Media Thickness (IMT)Several studies reported an association between serum lycopenelevels and intima-media thickness (Gianetti et al., 2002; Riccioniet al., 2009, 2011; Karppi et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2014), whileother authors reported no association (Dwyer et al., 2004;Table 2). Zou et al. revealed a decrease in carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) after 12 months of lutein and lycopenesupplementation (20mg each) in 144 Chinese patients withsubclinical atherosclerosis, demonstrating more effective resultsafter the intake of both lutein and lycopene compared to luteinalone (Zou et al., 2014).High serum levels of lycopene, alpha and beta-carotene wereassociated with a slow IMT progression during 7 years in a studyincluding 840 middle-aged men from Eastern Finland (Karppiet al., 2013). The association between lycopene level and IMTwas mentioned in the scientific literature also for elderly Finishsubjects (Karppi et al., 2011).Higher carotenoids levels (lutein, zeaxanthin, and beta-cryptoxanthin; Figure 1) were correlated with reduced IMTprogression over 18 months, in a study with 573 middle-agedparticipants, free of cardiovascular symptoms at baseline. Beta-carotene and lycopene levels were not significantly associatedwith IMT progression (Dwyer et al., 2004).An inverse correlation was found in women between lycopenelevels and IMT, independent of conventional risk factors, in alarge study including 1,111 subjects (McQuillan et al., 2001).WHY CONFLICTING RESULTS?Several studies revealed the anti-atherosclerotic effect of lycopene(McQuillan et al., 2001; Gianetti et al., 2002; Hu et al., 2008;Verghese et al., 2008; Riccioni et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010;Gajendragadkar et al., 2014), but there are also studies availablethat report conflicting results related to the vascular effects oflycopene (McQuillan et al., 2001; Dwyer et al., 2004; Stanglet al., 2011; Thies et al., 2012). The possible reasons for thisobvious discrepancy are manifold and include methodologicaldifferences in the study designs, such as different lycopenesources, the use of food-frequency questionnaires, differentintervention times, the methodology used to assess vascularfunction, measurement of blood, adipose or dietary lycopene.Besides those, the use of unstandardized amounts of tomatofood products, different modes of delivery, misclassificationof overall tomato intake, combination of lycopene with otherantioxidants, different processing procedures or eating behaviorinfluenced by cultural and temporal patterns among differentindividuals, may influence the results (Sesso et al., 2003; Konget al., 2010; Thies et al., 2012; Gajendragadkar et al., 2014).Other carotenoids extracted from tomatoes could be also partiallyresponsible for the effects attributed to lycopene (Rao, 2002).This is underlined by a study that could not find beneficialeffects for lycopene supplementation alone, but beneficial effectsupon supplementation with tomato-based products (Sesso et al.,2003). Some studies did not consider dietary intake at all (Yeoet al., 2011). The interaction flavanone metabolites--lycopeneis difficult to assess, considering the rapid metabolization ofthe mentioned metabolites (Habauzit et al., 2015). Duration oftreatment, dose and bioavailability of lycopene, and vascularendpoint were also different in the studies published on thistopic and might have influenced obtained results. Several factorsinfluence the bioavailability of lycopene, such as season, theprocessing of tomatoes, their origin, dimensions, shape, and theway they are consumed (Gajendragadkar et al., 2014; Gammoneet al., 2015). Absorption of lycopene may be reduced by diets richin fibers and in elderly people (Kong et al., 2010) and is increasedin the presence of oil.The isomerization of lycopene is another source of variability.Fresh tomatoes contain lycopene in all-trans form (Shi andLe Maguer, 2000). Several factors, including high temperatures,light, oxygen, acids, and metal ions enable isomerization oflycopene (Kong et al., 2010). Lycopene degradation occurs duringthermal processing, mainly isomerization of all- trans to cisforms and oxidation (Shi and Le Maguer, 2000). Dehydrated andpowdered tomatoes have poor lycopene stability, depending ofstorage in a hermetically sealed atmosphere, and a significantincrease of cis-isomers, giving the highest bioavailability oflycopene and higher ability to be incorporated in lipoproteins(Shi and Le Maguer, 2000; Kong et al., 2010). Uptake of cislycopene is significantly higher than all trans-isomers (Konget al., 2010).Lycopene is very bioavailable in the presence of oil, especiallyin monounsaturated oils, other dietary fats and processed tomatoproducts (Shi and Le Maguer, 2000; Basu and Imrhan, 2007;Kong et al., 2010; Gajendragadkar et al., 2014). Lycopene canincrease the antioxidant properties of vitamin C, E, polyphenolsand beta-carotene in a synergistic way (Kong et al., 2010;Karppi et al., 2013). Supplementation with tomatoes, containinglycopene (red tomatoes) or not (yellow tomatoes), showed abetter antioxidant effect than lycopene alone, probably dueto the synergistic effects of naturally occurring secondarymetabolites in tomatoes (Basu and Imrhan, 2007; Gitenay et al.,2007). Generally, supplementation with whole fruits is oftenmore beneficial than supplementing single food constituents:Watermelons contain, besides lycopene, hundreds of differentcompounds, including L-citrulline and ascorbic acid, both ofwhich improve the L-arginine/NOpathway, endothelial function,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 521114Mozos et al.
