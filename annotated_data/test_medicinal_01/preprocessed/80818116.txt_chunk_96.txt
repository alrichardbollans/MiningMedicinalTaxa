search on Scopus da-tabase (www.scopus.com.scopeesprx.elsevier.com) per-formed on 1.11.2015 using key words "Alzheimer's dis-ease" resulted with 105860 items. Annual analysis pointed to the growing scientific interest for AD research as num-ber of published items continuously increased during the years. First 2 published articles related to AD were found to be in 1912 year and the number was relatively low till 1988 (less than 800 per year). Further on, AD research rap-idly grew with more than 4000 published scientific papers in 2005, thus reaching its maximum in 2014 with >8000 published scientific items (at the time of search for 2015 there were 6417, and 60 for 2016 year). Also, search on www.clinicaltrials.gov.mk carried out on 27.10.2015 re-sulted with total of 1769 AD clinical trials allocated to all continents around the globe. At the time of search 541 clin-ical trials were with status OPEN, mainly in USA, Europe, China and Japan - 231, 175, 67 and 41 respectively. In Eu-rope most of the studies (56.6%) were located in France, followed by United Kingdom (18.3%) and Spain (17.1%). Nearly 30% of active trials were related to drug substanc-es not yet approved for AD. Beside high number of clini-cal trials we have to be held in reserve as for a period of 10 years (2002-2012) 244 AD drugs were in clinical trials, but only one, MEM in 2003, was approved (0.4% succeed rate) (Alzheimer's, 2015). It is a fact that development of new drugs for treatment of AD is difficult and compli-cated due to the high costs, relatively long time needed to observe disease progression in AD and blood-brain bar-rier. Problems associated with blood-brain barrier might be surmounted by innovative therapeutic systems (ITS) for drug targeting and controlled release (liposomes, mi-celles, nanoparticles etc). Namely, utilizing their unique physico-chemical and biopharmaceutical properties drug targeted and controlled release dosage form with modi-fied/improved pharmacokinetics/dynamics might be de-veloped. Conducted search on Scopus database (accessed on 13.08.2015) retrieved 666 scientific papers (SP) related to micelles, liposomes, solidlipid nanoparticles, nanostruc-tured lipid carriers and nanoparticles as ITS and/or RIV (197 SP), tacrine (124 SP), MEM (189 SP) and DON (156 SP) as drug substances. However in detail analysis of re-trieved items revealed that only 15 (2.25%) were original research papers, and others were reviews. A vast majority of the original research papers (86.7%) were related to RIV and only 6.7% were related to DON and MEM, each. Li-posomes and micelles as carriers for RIV were studied in 26.7% and 6.7% of the research papers, respectively. On the other hand most of the conducted research (66.7%) was related to nanoparticles, where's 80% were focused on RIV and 10% on DON and MEM, each. All of them were char-acterized in terms of particle size, drug content/ encapsu-lation efficiency, zeta potential and in vitro dissolution and majority (66.7%) conducted in vivo animal studies. All ob-tained results in the reviewed studies pointed to ITS poten-tial use for AD efficacious treatment.Based on the retrieved data it can be concluded that although ITS for different conditions are already in use for more than 20 years (1989 FDA approved Diprivan(r) - surfactant-based nanoformulation of anestetic Propofol) exploration of their potentials for AD treatment is still in its begging's.ReferencesAlzheimer's, A., 2015.

After intravenous administration blood is the first biolog-ical environment nanoparticles are exposed to, compris-ing a pool of several thousand proteins in different con-centrations (Monopoli et al., 2011). Plasma proteins tend to adsorb on the naoparticle surface forming so-called pro-tein corona, which governs the nano-bio interactions and determines nanoparticles fate following their administra-tion. Modified biological identity of nanoparticles will af-fect the physiological response including their circulation time, agglomeration, transport, accumulation, internaliza-tion and toxicity.Nanoparticle characteristics (size, shape, surface charge, surface functional groups and hydrophilicity/hy-drophobicity), the nature of physiological environment (blood, intestinal fluid, cytoplasm) and the exposure time play a key role in the process of protein corona formation (Masoud et al., 2013). The rate of adsorption/desorption of different proteins, competitive binding, steric stabiliza-tion induced by adsorbed polymers and surfactants as well as the protein composition of body fluids lead to dynamic changes of the protein corona. In the initial phase, usually the most abundant plasma proteins, such as albumin, are adsorbed at the surface of in-travenously administered nanoparticles. In time, albumin can be replaced by proteins with higher binding affinity towards NP surface, since the protein corona composition continuously exchange (Vroman effect). It is worth men-tioning that there is a possibility for structural and func-tional changes of proteins that interact with the nanopar-ticle surface, which could lead to activation of molecu-lar mechanisms resulting in certain pathogenesis (Nel et al., 2009). Therefore, a detailed protein corona character-ization is crucial for biocompatibility assessment of the nanoparticulate drug delivery system.For this purpose, in this study we conducted compara-tive protein corona composition analysis of three different polymeric nanoparticles at several time intervals.Materials and methodsPoly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-Poly(ethylene glycol)-b-Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) with two different molecular weights (Mw~148000Da and Mw~22000Da) and Poly(DL-lactide-co-caprolactone) (P(DLLACL copolymer, LA:CL 10:90, Mw 77799 Da) were purchased from AkinaInc, USA. Acrylamide-biacryl-amide 37.5:1, 30% solution, Electrophoresis running buf-fer, Laemmli buffer and Comassie brilliant blue were ob-tained from Bio-Rad, USA. Tris (hydroxymethyl) amino-methane (TRIS) base, Sodium dodecyl sulphate and Amo-niumpersulphate were acquired from Sigma Aldrich, USA, while N,N,N',N'-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) was purchased from MerckMilipore, Germany. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were used as re-ceived.Nanoparticle preparationThree types of nanoparticles (NP1, NP2 and NP3) were prepared by nanoprecipitation method as described before (Dimchevska et al., 2015; Koliqi et al., 2016). Following copolymers were used for this purpose: PLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw~148000Da), PLGA-PEO-PLGA (Mw~22000Da) and P(DLLACL), respectively.S4 PP 191404Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 403 - 404 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsProtein corona evaluationSemi-quantitative protein corona evaluation was per-formed using SDS-PAGE - sodium dodecyl sulphate poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. 4% stacking gel and 10% resolving gel were used to estimate the protein corona com-position of nanoparticles. At first, all NPs (1mg/mL) were incubated with 50% of human plasma at 37 degC for three dif-ferent time periods (30min, 1h and 4h) in a water bath at stirring rate of 100 oscillations/min (Haake, Denmark). Af-ter the incubation, nanoparticles were pelleted by centrifu-gation (18000xg, 30 min at 4 degC) and the plasma was dis-carded. The samples were washed twice with 1.5 mL PBS and the supernatant was removed. 25 uL of Laemmli sam-ple buffer containing 5% b-mercaptoethanol was then add-ed to each sample. Samples were vortexed for 30s and heat-ed at 95 degC for 5min in order to provide desorption and de-naturation of adsorbed proteins. NPs were allowed to cool down at RT and then 5uL of each sample were loaded into the stacking gel placed on a vertical system (Mini Protean Cell, BioRad, USA). Gels were run for 60-90 min at 110 mV. After the protein separation the gels were removed, im-mersed in a 0.1% Coomassie blue solution and left to stand for 16h. The next day, each gel was washed with destaining solution (40% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid and 50% deionized water) in four cycles. Pictures were acquired on white background using VersaDoc, Bio-Rad, USA. Densi-tometric analysis of proteins was performed using Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software, Bio-Rad, USA.Results and discussionTime-resolved protein evaluation confirmed the dy-namic character of protein corona for all types of investi-gated nanoparticles. The results revealed a presence of an intense band around 66 kDa at each time point for all types of NPs, which corresponds to the molecular weight of al-bumin. Since albumin is the most abundant plasma protein with modular structural organization, high molecular flex-ibility and variety of binding sites on its surface, mutual non-specific interactions with the NPs were promoted, es-pecially in the early time points of the experiment.Further, we have noticed that different binding pat-terns for different NPs over time were displayed, probably due to their specific surface properties. Also, various com-position of protein corona for each type of NPs was ob-served at the later time periods (1h and 4h) which corre-spond to protein corona dynamic nature and concomitant association/dissociation of diverse protein molecules dur-ing time. The results for longer incubation periods have shown that albumin was progressively replaced by other proteins with higher affinity and increased binding spec-ificity to the NP surfaces, regardless of their plasma con-centration. Proteins with molecular weights of 43 kDa, 41 kDa, 32 kDa and 25 kDa have gradually replaced the ini-tially adsorbed albumin (66 kDa) as well as proteins with Mw of 55 kDa and 50 kDa at the surface of NP1 and NP2. Additionally, one characteristic band at 8 0kDa was ob-served at the later time points for NP2 which could not be observed for NP1. Protein corona composition of NP3 for-mulation was significantly different compared to NP1 and NP2, probably due to the higher hydrophobicity of the NP core. Specific proteins adsorbed onto the NP3 surface were those with Mw of 28 kDa, 36 kDa, 46 kDa, including one high molecular weight protein (Mw 185 kDa). Our results correspond to the literature data for protein adsorption upon polymer NP surfaces. Namely, in the ear-ly time points of the experiment, albumin and fibrinogen were dominant components of the NP protein corona. Lat-er on, significant differences appeared among the adsorbed imunoglobulins upon the surfaces of various NPs and ad-ditionally apolipoproteins came to be a significant portion of the total protein quantity.ConclusionDisplacement of proteins over time was confirmed for all evaluated types of NPs. It was shown that abundant pro-teins such as albumin and fibrinogen may initially occupy the NP surface and get subsequently replaced by other pro-teins having higher binding affinity like apolipoproteins.Different protein binding patterns lead to altered bio-logical identity of NPs that will affect their in vivo behav-ior including their biodistribution, cell internalization, tox-icity and efficacy.ReferencesDimchevska, S., Geskovski, N., Koliqi, R., Gomez Vallejo, V., Szczupak, B., Hristov, D.R., Errasti Lopez, M., San Sebastian, E., Monopoli, M.P., Llop, J., Goracinova, K., 2015.
