Where appropriate, this information may relate to the foodstuff after preparation, provided that suffi ciently detailed preparation instructions are given and the information relates to the food as prepared for consumption.1021 Information on vitamins and minerals must also be expressed as a percentage of the recommended daily allowance.1022According to the Commission, there is a need to revise the nutrition labelling directive to address fundamental issues relating to nutrition labelling1023. Commission gathered stakeholder input on this subject in 2006. It has been suggested that nutrition labelling should be mandatory. At the moment, many companies are voluntarily providing the information (estimates suggest a range of between 30% and 85% for pre-packaged foods)1024. Consumers are in favour of mandatory nutrition labelling, the industry isn't. Both sides and also member state governments might be willing to settle for a compromise solution. This would make nutrition labelling mandatory but grant derogations, create transitional measures and offer necessary fl exibilities1025. When discussing what should be on the nutrient list, the 'Big 4' (i.e. 1016 Article 3.1017 Article 4(1-2).1018 Article 4(3).1019 Article 4(4).1020 Article 6(2).1021 Article 6(4).1022 Article 6 (5)(a).1023 Labelling: competitiveness, consumer information and better regulation for the EU.

Page 15.-184-energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates) and the 'Big 8' (i.e. the Big 4 plus saturated fat, sugar, fi bre and sodium) were most often mentioned1026.In January 2008, the Commission fi nally gave a proposal combining the current food labelling directive 2000/13/EC and the nutrition labelling directive 90/496/EEC. The proposal is for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers1027. It is not surprising that the regulation form was chosen instead of a directive, see chapter 2.The most controversial point in the proposal is the introduction of mandatory labelling of key nutrients. The proposal adopts the Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) approach instead of the traffi c lights approach favoured by the UK's Food Standards Agency and the European Consumer Association (BEUC).1028 For example in Finland, the GDA approach was voluntarily adopted by the industry in 20071029.According to Article 29(1) of the proposed Regulation, the nutrition declaration shall include the following: energy value;(a) the amounts of fat, saturates, carbohydrates with specifi c reference to sugars, and salt. (b) These would need to be given per 100g or 100ml1030 and also by reference to GDAs1031. According to Article 29(2) of the proposed Regulation, the nutrition declaration may also include the amounts of trans fats, mono-unsaturates, polyunsaturates, polyols, starch, fi bre, protein, or certain vitamins and minerals. Trans fats would appear on nutrition declarations for the fi rst time.5.2.1.4 Marketing of Dietetic FoodsFoodstuffs for particular nutritional uses are also known as dietetic foods, defi ned in Directive 89/398/EC. Dietetic foods are foodstuffs which, owing their special composition or manufacturing process, are clearly distinguishable from foodstuffs for normal consumption, which are suitable for their claimed nutritional purposes and which are marketed in such a way as to indicate such suitability.1032 Above (chapter 4), we have already discussed the safety aspects of dietetic foods. Here we look at dietetic foods from a marketing perspective. "A particular nutritional use must fulfi l the particular nutritional requirements:of certain categories of persons whose digestive processes or metabolism are disturbed; or(i) 1026 Summary of results for the consultation document on: "Labelling: competitiveness, consumer information and better regulation for the EU".

Brussels, 30.1.2008.1028 Warnock 2008.1029 Elintarviketeollisuusliitto ry. Tiedote 7.2.2008. 1030 Article 31(2) of the proposed Regulation.1031 Article 31(3) of the proposed Regulation.1032 Article 1(2)(a), Directive on Foodstuffs Intended for Particular Nutritional Uses, 89/398/EC. Foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses have their own fortifi cation rules, set out in Commission Directive 2001/15.-185-of certain categories of persons who are in a special physiological condition and who (ii) are therefore able to obtain special benefi t from controlled consumption of certain substances in foodstuffs; orof infants or young children in good health. "(iii) 1033The fi rst rule on dietetic food marketing is the permission to use the word 'dietetic'. The products in sections (i) and (ii) may be characterised as 'dietetic' or 'dietary'1034. For normal products, the use of words 'dietetic' or 'dietary' is forbidden. This means that in the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for normal consumption, the use of the adjectives 'dietetic' or 'dietary' either alone or in conjunction with other words, to designate these foodstuffs is prohibited. Also all other markings or any presentation likely to give the impression that a dietetic food is involved are prohibited for normal products.1035. The second rule on dietetic food marketing is that for dietetic foods, nutrition labelling is mandatory regarding the amount of energy, protein, carbohydrates, and fat therein1036.Specifi c rules on specifi c dietetic foods are to be laid down by specifi c directives1037. These groups1038 are:instant formula and follow-on formula, -processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children, -food intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction, -dietary foods for special medical purposes (medical food), -foods intended to meet the expenditure of intense muscular effort, especially for -sportsmen, andfoods for persons suffering from carbohydrate-metabolism disorders (diabetes). -Directives on sports nutrition and diabetes foods are still missing as previously stated in chapter 4. The special directives include marketing rules. For example in the directive on weight-loss foods, it is stated that "the labelling, advertising and presentation of the products concerned shall not make any reference to the rate or amount of weight loss which may result from their use or to a reduction in the sense of hunger or an increase in the sense of satiety"1039.Drawing the line between ordinary foods with health claims and foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses has come up in different forms. Foods with health effects appear to be following two separate marketing lines: as normal foods and as dietetic foods. It is often possible that a foodstuff that has scientifi cally proven health-promoting effects will go under the defi nition of dietetic foods. Where a special diet is obeyed, it is often to reduce the risk of becoming ill. For example, persons with high cholesterol can use products with plant sterols to lower 1033 Article 1(2)(b).1034 Article 2(1).1035 Art. 2(2).1036 If the product contains less fat that 50 kJ/100g, only energy content has to be given. The long list of nutrition labelling is mandatory if you want to give the amount of sugar, fi bre, sodium, or saturated fats as something else than a nutritional special feature of the product. See previous chapter on 'short' and 'long' lists in nutrition labelling.1037 According to Article 4.1 of the Directive on dietetic foods.1038 As listed in Annex I of the Directive on dietetic foods.1039 Article 5(3).-186-the cholesterol levels in blood serum. This would be a particular nutritional use. For these products, product-specifi c risk reduction claims also seem appropriate, as the products lower the risk of coronary heart disease1040.Certain functional foods can be classifi ed as dietary foods if they are specially formulated and/or provide a part of the population health benefi ts over and above their normal nutritional values. Certain functional foods clearly are not dietary foods, as they provide the whole population with health benefi ts over and above their normal nutritional values.1041 This means that a product with a health claim such as "antioxidant" could not be classifi ed as a dietetic food, and that a product with a health claim such as "lowers blood pressure" could.Sometimes it is diffi cult to distinguish between "ordinary dietetic food" and medical food1042. Specifi cation of benefi ts can be a criterion to determine this. Since functional foods are by defi nition a part of a normal diet and they do not need any medical supervision, they are clearly distinguished from medical foods. If a certain food can provide distinctive dietary requirements to a patient requiring medical supervision, it can be sold as a medical food. If it can provide health benefi ts to a specifi ed group of people or to people in general, it should be sold as either an ordinary dietetic food or an ordinary food with a health claim.1043As stated above in chapter 4, the directive on dietetic foods establishes a notifi cation system. The primary purpose of the notifi cation system is not to verify the claim but rather to ensure that the food in question is distinguishable from foodstuffs for normal consumption and is suitable for the claimed nutritional purpose. However, several national administrations have indicated that they also verify the claim being made. Under the Directive, companies have to submit a model of the label used and may also be asked to produce scientifi c work and data1044.5.2.1.5 Marketing of Food SupplementsWith regard to marketing information on food supplements1045, the Directive 2002/46 details rules for their labelling. The marketer must provide information on the vitamin and mineral content, and on the proper use of the product. The name under which food supplements are sold shall be "food supplement"1046.The labelling shall bear the following particulars:1040 Swedish report 2001, 34. 1041 Kwak - Jukes 2000b, 111.1042 The defi nition of foodstuffs for special medical purposes was given above in chapter 4. Medical foods are a category of foods for particular nutritional uses specially processed or formulated and intended for the dietary management of patients and to be used under medical supervision. They are intended for the exclusive or partial feeding of patients with a limited, impaired or disturbed capacity to take, digest, absorb, metabolise or excrete ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients contained therein or metabolites. Directive 1999/21/EC Article 1(2)(b).1043 Kwak - Jukes 2000b, 112.1044 Article 9.1045 See defi nition of 'food supplement' above in chapter 4.1046 Article 6(1).-187-the names of the categories of nutrients or substances that characterise the product or (a) an indication of the nature of those nutrients or substances;the portion of the product recommended for daily consumption;(b) a warning not to exceed the stated recommended daily dose;(c) a statement to the effect that food supplements should not be used as a substitute for a (d) varied diet;a statement to the effect that the products should be stored out of the reach of young (e) children.1047Otherwise, the general marketing rules and the general food marketing rules apply. Marketing must not be misleading, and unfair commercial practices such as pyramid schemes are prohibited. Like foods in food form, food supplements also need to include an ingredient list, including statements on common allergens.5.2.1.6 Marketing of Novel FoodsThere are special labelling requirements for novel foods. According to Regulation 258/97/EC /on novel foods, the fi nal consumer must be informed of:any characteristic or food property (such as composition, nutritional value or nutritional (a) effects, or intended use of the food) which renders a novel food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient1048. In this case, the labelling must indicate the properties modifi ed, together with the method by which the property was obtained.the presence of material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and (b) which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population;the presence of material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and (c) which gives rise to ethical concerns.1049This means labelling has to give information on substances that traditional, equivalent products do not have, for example on allergenic proteins, or on materials that may cause ethical insecurity in some consumer groups. Information on changed composition, nutritional quality or purpose of use compared to normal product must also be given. In the absence of an existing equivalent food or food ingredient, appropriate provisions shall be adopted where necessary in order to ensure that consumers are adequately informed of the nature of the food or food ingredient1050. When authorising a product, the labelling question is resolved at the same time. The product labels are customized and accepted for each product separately.1047 Article 6(3).1048 "A novel food or food ingredient shall be deemed to be no longer equivalent ... if scientifi c assessment, based upon an appropriate analysis of existing data, can demonstrate that the characteristics assessed are different in comparison with a conventional food or food ingredient, having regard to the accepted limits of natural variations for such characteristics. "1049 Article 8(1).1050 Article 8(2).-188-With novel food labelling, one should notice that mandatory statements required by Community law shall not be considered as claims. They are thus not in the scope of the Nutrition and Health Claim Regulation, which covers only claims made on a voluntary basis. This applies for example to statements on cholesterol for products containing phytosterols, phytostanols, or their esters.1051 The Commission Regulation 608/2004/EC1052 requires that the labelling of these products includes a statement that the product is intended exclusively for people who want to lower their blood cholesterol level1053.According to the proposed Regulation on novel foods, a Community list of authorised novel foods will be created. The decision to include a food on the Community list shall include, where appropriate, specifi c additional labelling for novel foods sold to the consumer1054.5.2.1.7 Marketing of GMO FoodRegulation 1830/2003/EC concerns the traceability and labelling of genetically modifi ed organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modifi ed organisms. In Europe, GMO food must be labelled as such. "For products consisting of or containing GMOs, operators shall ensure that:for pre-packaged products consisting of, or containing GMOs, the words 'This product (a) contains genetically modifi ed organisms' or 'This product contains genetically modifi ed [name of organism(s)]' appear on a label;for non-pre-packaged products offered to the fi nal consumer the words 'This product (b) contains genetically modifi ed organisms' or 'This product contains genetically modifi ed [name of organism(s)]' shall appear on, or in connection with, the display of the product. "1055This means the labelling requirement applies to products such as fl our, oils, and glucose syrups if they are from a GMO source, such as GM soy or maize. Products produced with GMO technology, cheese produced with GMO enzymes, for example, does not have to be labelled. Neither do products such as meat, milk and eggs from animals fed on GMO animal feed.1056 Consumers have expressed complaints and demanded to know about GMO use in the whole production chain.Conventional products, i.e. products created without recourse to genetic modifi cation, may be accidentally contaminated by GMOs during harvesting, storage, transport or processing1057. 1051 Scientifi c Committee on Food Safety and Animal Health.

Article 2 also stipulates other important mandatory statements that have to be used on the labels to inform the consumers on the safe and proper use of these products.1054 Novel food proposal 2007, page 7.1055 Article 4(B)(6).1056 UK Food Standards Agency.

This is the case when operators demonstrate to the competent authorities that they have taken adequate measures to avoid the presence of this material1059.5.2.1.8 Marketing of "Junk Food"In Europe, discussions on advertising of so-called junk food have been going on. In the UK, advertising of foods and drinks with high fat, salt and sugar content has been restricted since June 2007 and these foods cannot be marketed during television programming aimed at under sixteen-year-old viewers. The UK Offi ce of Communications1060 also considered forbidding all food advertising aimed at children.1061The UK food and drink industry had previously self-regulated advertising: some had withdrawn from advertising to younger children. However, the food industry was "shocked" when the Ofcom restrictions came to its attention. They would have preferred the restriction to only apply to programs for children up to the age of nine as had been discussed. They would have preferred longer transition periods.
