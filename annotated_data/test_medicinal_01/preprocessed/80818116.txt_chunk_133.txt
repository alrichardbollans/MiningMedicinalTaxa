Within the study, different mode of action, on the one hand the glucocorticoid, was compared to a physical, membrane stabilizing molecule. Important-ly, it was shown that nasal symptom scores of both treat-ment groups improved significantly over the study period of 14 days. Although advantages of the beclomethasone spray in comparison with the ectoine spray were shown, re-sults of the ectoine group showed its potential clinical effi-cacy. Glucocorticoids bind to specific glucocorticoid recep-tors which are present on almost all cells of the body. Fol-lowing binding, transcription of a number of inflammato-ry cytokines and chemokines can be modulated, which in turn results in decreased recruitment and activation of in-flammatory cells. In allergic rhinitis, this results in a quick improvement of inflammatory symptoms which was con-firmed in the results of the beclomethasone group. Oppo-sitely, ectoine acts physically via a mechanism called "pref-erential exclusion." In the presence of ectoine, membranes and lipids are protected indirectly. As ectoine is expelled from the surface of proteins and lipids, those are protect-ed by a water shell, thereby increasing the fluidity of mem-branes and resulting in the preferential formation of the na-tive conformation of proteins. This might stabilize mucous membranes such as lining epithelia of the nose, thereby protecting those from invading allergens and reducing al-lergen-induced inflammations as shown in different model systems and as reported in congress report. It is understood that many allergens which cause allergic rhinitis symptoms have protease activities which act by impairing epithelial barrier function. This in turn results in increased penetra-tion of allergens into nasal mucosa. The barrier stabilizing properties of ectoine may counteract this scenario by im-proving the epithelial barrier and stabilizing membranes. In allergic rhinitis, this might protect the nasal mucosae from invading allergens, resulting in improvement of symptoms.A recent placebo-controlled study in an environmental challenge chamber showed that 3 hours after application of the ectoine nasal spray and eye drops the symptoms were decreased by ~20%.ConclusionTaken together, this meta-analysis demonstrated that the application of ectoine-based nasal spray and eye drops improves symptoms of allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis. This easy-to-apply, well-tolerated, naturally-based nasal and ocular treatment, which has no unpleasant taste and virtually no side effects, effectively reduces allergic rhinitis symptoms and represents an exciting alternative for rhinoconjunctivitis sufferers.ReferencesAngier, E., Willington, J., Scadding, G., Holmes, S., Walker, S., 2010.

Inherited variations in the TPMT enzyme activity are especially important in determination of individual differences between patients regarding the therapeutic response as well as the toxic effects of AZA treatment (Al Hadithy et al., 2005; Ansari et al., 2002). Additionally, inherited variations in TPMT enzyme activity have an impact on production of active 6-thioguanine nucleotide metabolite (6-TGN) after administration of AZA or 6-mercaptopurine (Wright et al., 2004). Regarding this, higher concentration of 6-TGN metabolite (235-450 pmol/8x108 Er) means better outcome of the disease activity, and therapeutic response as well (Cuffari et al., 2011; Dubinsky et al., 2000).The aims of this study were to assess the relationship between TPMT enzyme activity and concentration of 6-TGN metabolite and to determine the impact of concentration of 6-TGN metabolite on the disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, treated with AZA.Materials and methodsThirty-nine (39) patients with IBD from the Gastro-enterohepatology clinic, Skopje were included in this study. All of them had used AZA in a period of more than 3 months. Determination of TPMT enzyme activity was performed using the ELISA method (Bradford and Shih, 2011). 3-5mL of blood volume was taken in a tube with EDTA or heparin as an anticoagulant. In a period of 30 minutes after the blood draw, samples were centrifuged (1000g, 15 min.). Plasma was taken out and freezed on -20 or -80degS until analysed. The technique of determi-nation of the TPMT enzyme activity using ELISA meth-od was performed in accordance with the reference manu-al of the manufacturer of the ELISA kit, "HumanThiopu-rineMethyltransferase (TPMT) ELISA Kit, My BioSource, USA. In order to establish a control group, blood samples were taken from healthy volunteers as well. Eritrocytes were than isolated from the blood sample and concentra-tion of the 6-TGN was determined using the HPLC meth-od. The bioanalytical method was validated according to the EMA Guideline on validation of bioanalytical method (EMA, 2011). The disease activity was assessed using the well known, Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) (Gas-che et al., 2000) and the Ulcerative colitis activity index (UCAI) (Walmsey et al., 1998). According to the concen-tration of 6-TGN metabolite, patients were divided in three groups: subtherapeutic group (<200 pmol/8x108 Er); ther-S6 PP 261548Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 547 - 548 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsapeutic (200-400 pmol/8x108 Er) and overdosed (>400 pmol/8x108 Er) (Smith et al., 2013). Results assessment of 6-TGN metabolite concentration in patients was estab-lished for the first time in Macedonia in a collaboration be-tween two institutions, Department of Preclinical and Clin-ical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical Faculty, Sko-pje and the Faculty of Pharmacy, Skopje.Results and discussionThe average value of TPMT enzyme activity in all pa-tients was 18,49 U/mL Er +- 8.27 U/mL Er (min. 1.9 U/mL Er, max. 35.8 U/mL Er). The average value of 6-TGN metabolite concentration was 437,46 pmol/8x108 Er +- 198.82 pmol/8x108 (min. 64.8 pmol/8x108 , max. 905.5 pmol/8x108). The results of this study have shown linear indirect moderate correlation between the TPMT enzyme activ-ity and 6-TGN metabolite concentration in patients with IBD treated with AZA (Spearman Rank Order Corellation: R=-0,3632). As the TPMT enzyme activity was increasing, 6-TGN concentration was decreasing (p>0,05). Adittionaly, and increased concentration of 6-TGN correlated with increased probability of remission.ConclusionMonitoring of 6-TGN metabolite concentration in combination with determination of the TPMT enzyme activity may predict the therapeutic response in patients with IBD treated with AZA. As well, the result suggests that the method could be useful for detection of patients who do not respond to this therapy in order to identify new alternative treatments.ReferencesAnsari, A., Hassan, C., Duley, J., Marinaki, A., Shobowale-Bakre, E.M., Seed, P., 2002.

Antifungal drugs are therapeutic agents ex-tensively used to treat these infections. They can be classi-fied in two groups: first, the natural antifungal antibiotics and second, synthetic drugs. According to the way of ad-ministration antifungal drugs can be topical and systemic agents. For the systemic, drug's properties such as absorp-tion, distribution, plasma protein binding, metabolism or route of elimination considerably influence their therapeu-tic success (Lemke and Williams, 2013). The drug's in vivo efficiency is significantly influenced by its plasma protein binding (PPB). In vivo the drug molecules can be bound to proteins and lipids in plasma, to proteins and lipids in tis-sues, or can be free (unbound) and diffuse among the aque-ous environment of the blood and tissues. Depending on a specific affinity for plasma protein, a portion of the bound and unbound drug may differ. In most cases, only free drug molecules interact with the therapeutic target, a receptor, to produce effective therapy results and free drug's fraction is the one that can be metabolized and excreted. One of the advantages of drug modeling is the ability to find an opti-mal drug PPB range (Lemke and Williams, 2013). A number of drug's molecular physicochemical prop-erties notably influence its ADME properties. Lipophilici-ty, molecular weight, molecular volume, polar surface area and solubility play important roles in drug absorption, pen-etration into tissues, distribution as well as the degree of plasma protein binding and route of elimination. In our previous papers we studied the relationship between An-giotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor's lipophilicity and protein binding data (Odovic and Trbojevic-Stankovic, 2012).
