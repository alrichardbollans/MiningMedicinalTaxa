Besides, it alsomodulated the expression of let-7, miR-200 families and theirdownstream targets in colon cancer cells (Takahashi et al., 2012).Apart from cancer, the effect of guggul has been well provenagainst different inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoidarthritis, IBD, and various other diseases such as obesity,otitis media, uveitis etc. For example, treatment with GSdownregulated RANKL induced osteoclastogenesis and blockedIL-1beta mediated production of chemokines and epithelialneutrophil activating peptide-78 (ENA-78), MMP-1,-3 viasuppression of NF-kB, nuclear p50, and p65 subunit and IkBadegradation in rheumatoid arthritis (Ichikawa and Aggarwal,2006; Kinne et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2008; Ammon, 2016). Astudy conducted by Cheon and group on IBD showed thatGS inhibited IL-1beta- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- inducedICAM-1 expression, NF-kB transcription activity and IkBphosphorylation/degradation in humanCaco-2 cells and rat non-transformed IEC-18 cells (Cheon et al., 2006). Further, treatmentwith GS alone showed increase in apoptosis and lipolysis andits combination with genistein resulted in increased cleavageof procaspase-3, PARP, expression of Bax, release of cyt-c andprevented lipid accumulation in maturing adipocytes resulting ininhibition of adipogenesis (Yang et al., 2007, 2008). GS exertedits effect against otitis media, the foremost cause of hearingimpairment in children by inhibiting LPS-induced upregulationof TNF-a expression, COX-2 production and IkBa degradation(Ovesen and Ledet, 1992; Barrett et al., 2003; Song et al., 2010).In case of uveitis, treatment with GS inhibited LPS-inducedexpression of inflammatory proteins in human primary non-pigment ciliary epithelial cells (Kalariya et al., 2010).As guggul is an FXR antagonist, it is used extensively as acholesterol-lowering agent (Rizzo et al., 2006; Shah et al., 2012).GS eliminated the effect of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), anFXR agonist on the expression of Cdx2 and MUC2 and thusprevented bile acid induced gastric intestinal metaplasia andcarcinogenesis (Xu et al., 2010). Oswley and Chiang reportedthat GS antagonizes FXR induction of BSEP but activatespregnane X receptor to inhibit CYP7A1 gene (Owsley andChiang, 2003). In addition, Commiphora and Boswellia showedpotent cardioprotective as well as thyroid-stimulatory effects(Singh et al., 1982; Deng, 2007). For instance, GS inhibitedDOX induced cytotoxicity, reduced apoptosis, and intracellularROS and formation of MDA in DOX-treated H9C2 cells (WangFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68661Kunnumakkara et al. Googling the Guggulet al., 2012). In addition, triterpenes and prenylaromadendrane-type diterpenes from the gum resin of B. carterii was shownto exert hepatoprotective effect against d-galactosamine-inducedliver cell damage (Wang et al., 2013, 2016).IN VIVO STUDIES WITH COMMIPHORAAND BOSWELLIA AND THEIR ROLE INDIFFERENT CHRONIC DISEASESPromising after effects of Commiphora and Boswellia againstvarious chronic diseases in the in vitro setting has led toa handful of in vivo studies where the efficacy of guggulwas evaluated in different experimental models of diversechronic diseases such as cancer, inflammatory, cardiovascular,and metabolic diseases, atherosclerosis, asthma etc. (Table 2;Figure 4). Recently, several studies have reported the anti-tumorefficacy of guggul in different cancers such as cancers of breast,esophagus, head, and neck, pancreas, prostate etc. (An et al.,2009). For instance, AKBA was found to prevent intestinaltumorigenesis and exert chemopreventive effect via inhibitionof wnt/b-catenin and NF-kB/COX-2 signaling pathways (Liuet al., 2013; Wang R. et al., 2014). Another study showed AKBAto function via modulation of let-7 and miR-200 downstreamgenes in colorectal (CRC) tumors (Takahashi et al., 2012).In case of breast cancer, treatment with GS increased thechemosensitivity of MCF-7/DOX cells to doxorubicin in vivothrough inhibition of Bcl-2 and Pgp (Xu et al., 2014b). Inaddition, GS suppressed esophageal tumor cell viability viainhibition of FXR and prevented the growth of esophagealcancer cells significantly in combination with amiloride in vivo(Guan et al., 2013, 2014). Furthermore, in case of glioma, cyanoenone of methyl boswellates (CEMB), and 3-a-propionyloxy-b-boswellic acid (POBA) significantly inhibited the tumor growthin murine models (Ravanan et al., 2011; Qurishi et al., 2013).Again, topical application of Boswellin (BE); B. serrata gum resinexudate inhibited skin inflammation, epidermal proliferation,and tumor promotion induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated mice. Additionally, treatment with guggulipid wasshown to cause reduced growth of HNSCC cells in vivo (Leeman-Neill et al., 2009). Besides, GS enhanced the antitumor efficacyof gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer via modulation of Akt, NF-kB, and apoptosis-related proteins (Ahn et al., 2012). In caseof prostate cancer as well, guggul has been found to be highlyeffective in vivo (Syrovets et al., 2005b; Buchele et al., 2006;Pang et al., 2009; Pathania et al., 2015). Oral administration ofguggulsterone prevented in vivo angiogenesis of prostate cancercells through suppression of VEGF-VEGF-R2-Akt signaling(Xiao and Singh, 2008).Apart from cancer, the efficacy of guggul was well proven indifferent inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, colitis, gastritis,IBD, pancreatitis, uveitis etc. (Sharma et al., 1989; Cheon et al.,2006; Xiao and Singh, 2008; Mencarelli et al., 2009; Kalariyaet al., 2010; Kim et al., 2010, 2013; Dhaneshwar et al., 2013; Kanget al., 2013; Wang R. et al., 2014). In case of rheumatoid arthritis,treatment with guggul decreased the thickness of joint swelling,reduced the infiltration of leucocytes into the pleural cavity,suppressed the pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased beta-glucuronidase activity in vivo (Sharma and Sharma, 1977; Reddyand Dhar, 1987; Sharma et al., 1989; Fan et al., 2005). In addition,guggul reduced the severity of IBD via inhibition of LPS- orIL-1beta-induced ICAM-1 gene expression and NF-kB activity(Krieglstein et al., 2001; Cheon et al., 2006; Mencarelli et al., 2009;Kim et al., 2010). Furthermore, administration of GS resulted inmitigation of histological damage, suppressed serum lipase levels,inhibition of infiltrations of neutrophils, and macrophages anddecreased cytokine production in pancreatitis (Kim et al., 2015).Moreover, GS inhibited the expression of endotoxin-induceduveitis (EIU)-associated inflammatory markers such as MMP-2,NO, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Kalariya et al., 2010).Guggul exhibited profound cardioprotective effects aswell in vivo (Chander et al., 2003). It decreased the lipidperoxide, creatine phosphokinase, phospholipase, xanthineoxidase activities, and total cholesterol level in the serum;increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), myocardial antioxidants,glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), catalase (CAT); reducedglutathione (GSH), creatine-phosphokinase-MB (CK-MB),and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as reversed thecardiac damage induced by isoproterenol (Kaul and Kapoor,1989; Batra et al., 2000; Ojha et al., 2011). The hypolipidemiceffect of guggul has also been well studied in different animalmodels (Khanna et al., 1969; Dixit et al., 1980; Baldwa et al.,1981; Lata et al., 1991). Guggul diminished hyperlipidemiavia inhibition of FXR activation. In high-fat-diet-fed mice,treatment with GS improved blood glucose in fasting condition,plasma insulin level, glucose tolerance, level of harmful lipids,phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase,and other proteins like glucose transporter-4, PPARc, and TNF-a(Satyavati et al., 1969; Singh et al., 1990; Urizar et al., 2002;Cui et al., 2003; Sharma et al., 2009; Tripathi, 2009). Further,C. opobalsamum, C. mukul, B. serrata, and B. ovalifoliolataspecies mitigated hepatic damage and displayed protectiveeffect against lipid peroxidation and deviated serum enzymaticvariables (Al-Howiriny et al., 2004; Y et al., 2006; Mahesh et al.,2014). In addition, GS reversed neuronal damage and memorydeficits in mice by increasing glutathione level in the brains,antiacetylcholine esterase, and antioxidant activities (Saxenaet al., 2007). Apart from these, administration of GS was found toincrease thyroid function by enhancing iodine uptake, improvedthe activities of thyroid peroxidase, and protease and amelioratedhypothyroidism through its ability to increase thyroid hormonein vivo (Tripathi et al., 1975, 1984; Panda and Kar, 2005).Taken together, these pre-clinical studies provide substantialevidence of the enormous potential of guggul as a multi-targetedagent for the prevention and treatment of different chronicdiseases.CLINICAL STUDIES WITH COMMIPHORAAND BOSWELLIA AND THEIR ROLE INDIFFERENT CHRONIC DISEASESSeveral clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate theeffect of "guggul" from Commiphora and Boswellia onvarious chronic disorders.
