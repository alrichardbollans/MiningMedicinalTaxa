These 28 compounds were fur-ther tested at a lower range of concentrations to define their inhibitory activity and etoposide was used as the stan-dard drug in order to compare their activity. Of these 28 compounds, 12 derivatives had IC50 values between 11.4 and 46.8 uM range and they were considered as positive Topo II inhibitors. Among these compounds, 2-phenoxy-methylbenzothiazole, 6-nitro- 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)ben-zoxazole, 5-methylcarboxylate-2-phenylthiomethylbenz-imidazole, and 6-methyl-2-(2-nitrophenyl)-benzoxazole were found as more active than the reference drug etopo-side. Moreover, 5-nitro-2-(4-ethoxyphenyl)benzoxazole, 5-(4-fluorophenyl-carboxyamide)-2-phenylbenzoxazole), 5-methyl-2-phenylthiomethylbenzimidazole, and 5-nitro-2-phenoxymethylbenzimidazole had Topo II inhibitory ac-tivities comparable to etoposide. The results indicate that either having sterically bulky substituents such as phenylacetamide or phenoxyacet-amide groups at position 5 or holding a non-aromatic moi-ety as cyclohexyl or cyclopentyl rings and/or a pyridine ring at position 2 of the fused heterocyclic nucleus causes a severely reduced or lack of activity. On the other hand, different fused heterocyclic nuclei in the structures of the most potent Topo II inhibitors are indicating bioisosteric properties for the enzyme inhibitory activity (Pinar et al., 2004).For the 3D-QSAR studies, the best performed CoM-SIA model was obtained from the combination of two fields (i.e., steric and hydrophobic). The LOO cross-vali-dated PLS analysis of the best model gave rise to a cross-validated value (q2) of 0.562, suggesting that the model is a useful tool for predicting Topo II inhibitory activity. The correlation coefficient between the calculated and ex-perimental activities non crossvalidated value (r2) of 0.968 with standard error 0.073 indicates that the fitness of ana-lyzed results is 96.8% compared to experimental results. The respective relative contributions of steric and hydro-phobic fields are 35% and 65%, indicating that hydropho-bic field is more predominant. The established model was validated using a test set of compounds, which were not in-cluded in the development of the model (Tekiner-Gulbas et al., 2006). There are two significant contours representing the fa-vored steric area to increase the inhibition against the Topo II enzyme. If a bulky substituent, such as methoxy group, is attached on ortho position of 2-phenyl-5-nitro-benzox-azole, it will occupy into favorable for steric contour and will enhance the activity. According to the 5-methylcar-boxylate-2-phenylthiomethylbenzimidazole, both meta and para positions of the phenyl group, which are attached to the 2nd position of benzimidazole ring system, fit into the favorable for steric contour and improve the activity. In CoMSIA study, hydrophobic similarity index fields are also constructed and an area found, which is placed on phenyl ring of the most active compound 5-methylcarbox-ylate-2-phenylthiomethylbenzimidazole, means favorable for hydrophobic. The phenyl group of another the most ac-tive compound 2-phenyl-5-nitro-benzoxazole also fits into the same favorable area. On the other side, nitro group of 2-phenyl-5-nitro-benzoxazole and carbonyl group of ester moiety of 5-methylcarboxylate-2-phenylthiomethylbenz-imidazole play a very important role for increasing Topo II inhibitory activity. We could say that hydrophilic area is more significant than hydrophobic area to enhance the ac-tivity. Because all phenyl rings attached at the 2nd position of benzazole ring system fit into one of the favorable hy-drophobic contours.In conclusion, the results point out that benzimidazole, benzoxazole, benzothiazole, and/or oxazolopyridine de-rivatives also exhibit significant Topo II inhibitory activ-ity and may provide advanced opportunities to design and develop new chemotherapeutic agents.Furthermore, the observed COMSIA contour plots provide many useful in-sights into relationships between structural features and in-hibitory activity for these benzazole derivatives.ReferencesBeck, W.T., Mo, Y.Y., Bhat, U.G., 2001.

Borsari, 46 Ferrara, Italy* emilija.janevik@ugd.edu.mkIntroduction Our work was focused on the investigation for a ready to use prepared freeze dried rituximab immunoconjugates as potential radiopharmaceuticals for labeling with Lu-177 and Y-90 in order to increase the stability and higher efficiency and lower toxicity. We tested three bifunctional chelating agents (BFCA's), p-SCN-Bn-DOTA, p-SCN-Bn-DTPA and 1B4M-DTPA conjugated to the same antibody using previously established protocol for conjugation (Gjorgieva Ackova, 2014, 2015; Smilkov, 2014).The main goal was to investigate chemical character-ization of the immunoconjugates, labeled with "cold" non-radioactive isotopes of Lutetium and Yttrium in the same conditions as with radioactive Lutetium 177 and to show the chemical behavior and toxicological properties.Material and methodThe conjugation of antibody with three different bifunc-tional cleating agents was performed using using previous-ly established protocol for conjugation. The concentrations were adjusted to 1 mg/mL and the solutions were then ly-ophilized. The purified immunoconjugates were formulated in ab-sence of any cryoprotectant at the concentration of 10 mg/mL, and subsequently lyophilized according to selected pro-tocols.The process of freeze drying was completed using Lab-conco Free Zone Stoppering Tray Dryer, (USA), using pro-tocol described by Park in 2013, modified to our experience.Concentration of the antibody/immunoconjugate was determinate before and after freeze drying and reconstitu-tion using UV spectrophotometer (Jenway UV/VIS spectro-photometer 6715), and semi-micro UV polypropylene tubes with 0.1M PBS pH=8.0, at 280 nm in triplicate. After freeze drying both characterization of the conju-gates and determination of the average number of BFCA at-tached to each antibody molecule is performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and integrity of the antibody was evaluated using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, on 12% bis-tris acrylamide gel. The spectroscopic characterization of all three freeze dried immunoconjugates, in terms of monitoring the sec-ondary protein structure (and its preservation), was achieved S6 OP 256538Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 537 - 538 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencesby FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy.The freeze dying immunoconjugates after reconsti-tution were labeling with Lu-177 (555 MBq/mg in 0,5 M NH4OAc) and radiochemical purity was determined by in-stant thin-layer chromatography on silica plates with a mo-bile phase of ammonium acetate : methanol (1 : 1) using Cy-clone Plus Phosphore Imager (Perkin Elmer). The obtained radioimmunoconjugates were characterized by SE-HPLC, using a Zorbax Bio Series GF-250 column and the elution process was monitored on UV detector at 280 nm and radiodetector (Wojdowska, 2014).Toxicological studies were performed in Wistar rats af-ter injection of rituximab labeled with cold Lutetium and Yttrium. Biodistribution studies were performed in 5-6 week old nude mice grafted with Raji cells (2x106 cells in 0.5 mL medium solution) after injection of radioactive Lu-177-Rituximab.Results and discussionThe 3 day protocol of freeze drying without the presence of mannitol, showed the greatest similarity in the elution profiles of the immunoconjugate prior lyophilization (Gholipour, 2014). After freeze drying, the pellets obtained corresponded to the composition and the time until complete reconstitution after addition of saline showed no significant difference in the time of complete dissolution of the lyophilisates, i.e. all tested samples were completely reconstituted in 2 min.The average number of BFCA attached to each anti-body molecule performed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrom-etry shows presence of two main peaks corresponding to MW of 146491 Da (unconjugated antibody) and 149873 Da (conjugated antibody) which corresponds to an average of 6.1 groups of p-SCN-Bn-DOTA (M = 551.61 g*mol-1), two peaks also, corresponding to MW of 146477 Da (unconju-gated antibody) and 151246 Da (conjugated antibody) corre-sponds to an average of 8.8 groups of p-SCN-Bn-DTPA (M = 540.54 g*mol-1) attached to a molecule of rituximab and two peaks corresponding to MW of 146848 Da (unconjugat-ed antibody) and 151506 Da (conjugated antibody) corre-sponding to average of 8.3 groups 1B4M-DTPA (M = 555.58 g*mol-1) attached to a molecule of rituximab.All immunoconjugates (both before and after lyophili-zation) were separated in two distinct Mw species which mi-grated in two bands (upper at ~50 kDa and lower at ~25 kDa) confirming the migration behavior typical for IgG antibod-ies which are composed of twoidentical subunits each com-posed by two polypeptide chains: two heavy and two light chains, linked via 4 disulfide bonds. The obtained fragments correspond to molecular masses of rituximab heavy and light chain given at the literature (Bil, 2007;)In the experimental IR (in the region 2000-500 cm-1) and Raman spectra (2000-400 cm-1 region) we observed retaining of native structure of the antibody and no obvious aggregation.The radiochemical purity and determination of radioimmunoconjugates by SE-HPLC, obtained after radiolabeling the with Lu-177 was higher than 5%. These conjugates were stable for 48h in 0.9% NaCl, however, progressive aggregation was observed.Animal studies showed no toxicity and SPECT images in mice showed good localization of the tumor, as confirmed by ex-vivo organ counting. ConclusionAfter evaluation of all the obtained results obtained we can conclude:- Three immunoconjugates were synthesized, using p-SCN-Bn-DOTA, p-SCN-Bn-DTPA and 1B4M-DTPA using the a selected ratio, 1:20- Protocol for lyophilization was established, yielding lyophilisates with favorable physicochemical properties.- The non-radioactive labeling with Y and Lu showed preserved secondary structure in all three types of immunoconjugate, confirming their stability in conditions of freeze-drying and labeling- During labeling with Lu-177 all three types of radioimmunoconjugates showed high radiochemical purity, over 95%, which was confirmed both in ITLC and SE-HPLC.The selection of the most appropriate immunoconjugate kit suitable for labeling with Lu-177 or with Y-90 can be made after stability study of the formulation and completition of cell culture studies.ReferencesBil, J., Winiarska, M., 2007.
