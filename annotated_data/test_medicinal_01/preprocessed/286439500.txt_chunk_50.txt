Additionally, parameters ofoxidative stress were determined in different organs and immunecell distribution in two organs decisively involved in sepsispathogenesis, the liver and spleen. Since liver function is ofimportance for overall patient outcome, liver glycogen contentand biotransformation capacity, representing two importantliver function parameters, were also assessed. Finally, to furthersubstantiate the animal studies, cell-based experiments usinghuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) wereperformed to confirm the suppressive effect of Casp on cytokinerelease in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals and Experimental ProcedureThe study was conducted under the license of the ThuringianAnimal Protection Committee (approval number: 02-011/12).The principles of laboratory animal care and the German Law onthe Protection of Animals as well as the Directive 2010/63/EUwere followed. Male adult C57BL/6N mice (60-days-old, b.wt.25-30 g; Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany) wereused and the animals were housed in plastic cages understandardized conditions (light-dark cycle 12/12 h, temperature22 +- 2*C, humidity 50 +- 10%, pellet diet Altromin 1316, waterad libitum).A total of 48 mice were randomly divided into six groups(n = 8 each): control (vehicle-treated animals; 0.9% NaCl, usedfor dissolution of LPS), LPS, soy lecithin, Casp, soy lecithinplus LPS, and Casp plus LPS. LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4,Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was dissolved in 0.9%NaCl and injected intraperitoneally at a dosage of 5 mg/kgb.wt. With this dosage, a medium-grade non-lethal systemicinflammation was intended to allow for detection of possiblebeneficial effects of co-administered drugs (Seemann and Lupp,2015, 2016; Seemann et al., 2017). Thus, no antibiotic treatmentor fluid resuscitation of the animals was necessary. Soy lecithinand Casp (kindly donated by Indena S.p.A., Milano, Italy)were given orally at a dosage of 80 mg/kg b.wt. (equivalent tothe proportion of soy lecithin in Casp) or 240 mg/kg b.wt.,respectively, 3 h before LPS challenge to ensure maximumplasma levels of boswellic acids at the time of LPS challenge(Husch et al., 2013). Based on previous findings (Seemannet al., 2017), animals were sacrificed 24 h after LPS challengewhen plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are stillelevated and changes in immune cell distribution and liverfunction are already detectable. Twenty-four hours after LPStreatment, body temperature was measured and the mice's healthstatus was assessed by using the CSS described previously(Gonnert et al., 2011). Afterward, mice were sacrificed withan overdose of isoflurane, decapitated, and bled completely.Whole blood was collected in a tube (S Monovette R(c) 1.2 mlZ Clotting Activator/Serum, Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany)for clotting. Blood glucose levels were determined using adroplet of the whole blood with a commercially available bloodglucose meter and respective test strips (BG Star R(c), Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany). After 30 min, clotted blood wascentrifuged at 2000 x g for 10 min to obtain serum whichwas used for ELISA and enzymatic activity measurements.Additionally, brain, thymus, heart, lung, spleen, kidneys, liver,and adrenals were removed, weighed, and either fixed in 10%buffered formaldehyde or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen forbiochemical analysis. For histological analyses, formalin-fixedorgan samples were embedded in paraffin blocks (n = 8 animalsfor each treatment group).Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, Tumor NecrosisFactor (TNF)-a, and AlanineAminotransferase (ALAT) AssaysSerum levels of inflammatory and liver damage markerswere quantified with the following commercially availablereagents: mouse TNF-a Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems,Minneapolis, MN, United States), IL-6 Mouse ELISA Kit(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, United States), IL-10 MouseELISA Kit (Thermo Scientific), and EnzyChromTM AlanineTransaminase Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA,United States).Oxidative Status in the TissuesTo determine tissue content of GSH and GSSG, samples werehomogenized with 11 volumes of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer[5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA); pH 8.0] and4 volumes of 25% metaphosphoric acid. After centrifugation(12,000 x g, 4*C, 30 min), GSH was measured photometricallyin the supernatants (Ellman, 1959) and GSSG fluorometrically(Hissin and Hilf, 1976). To assess the tissue content of LPO asTBARS, tissue samples were homogenized with 19 volumes of ice-cold saline and analyzed fluorometrically, as previously described(Yagi, 1987).Liver Biotransformation CapacityBiotransformation capacity was assessed in the 9000 x gsupernatants of the livers. To obtain 9000x g supernatants, liversFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387123fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 4Loeser et al. Casperome R(c) in Systemic Inflammationwere homogenized with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)(1:3, w/v) and subsequently centrifuged at 9000 x g for 20 minat 4*C. The protein content of these fractions was determinedusing a modified Biuret method (Klinger and Muller, 1974). Fordetermination of CYP enzyme activities, the following modelreactions for different CYP isoforms were performed: ECOD[CYP1A, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2E (Aitio, 1978)], EROD [CYP1A (Pohland Fouts, 1980)], MROD [CYP1A2 (Lubet et al., 1985)], PROD[CYP2B (Lubet et al., 1985)], BROD [CYP2A, 2B, 2C, 3A (Lubetet al., 1985)], and EMND [CYP3A (Kleeberg and Klinger, 1982)].The amount of metabolite formed in these model reactions wasnormalized to the protein content of the respective 9000 x gsupernatants and expressed as (pmolxmg protein-1 xmin-1).Histopathology and ImmunohistochemistrySamples for histopathology and immunohistochemistry wereprepared by cutting 4-um sections from the paraffin blocks andfloating these onto positively charged slides. Immunostainingwas performed by an indirect peroxidase-labeling method, asdescribed previously (Kaemmerer et al., 2017). Briefly, sectionswere de-waxed, microwaved in 10 mM citric acid (pH 6.0) for16 min at 600 W, and incubated with the respective primaryantibodies (Table 1) at 4*C overnight. Detection of the primaryantibodies was performed using either biotinylated goat anti-rabbit, horse anti-mouse or rabbit anti-goat IgGs, followedby incubation with peroxidase-conjugated avidin (VectorABC "Elite" Kit, Vector, Burlingame, CA, United States).Binding of the primary antibody was visualized using3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) in acetate buffer (BioGenex,San Ramon, CA, United States). Sections were then rinsed,counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich,Steinheim, Germany), and mounted in VectaMountTMMounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,United States). All immunohistochemical stainings wereevaluated by two independent blinded investigators. To detectliver glycogen content, periodic-acid-Schiff staining (PAS;periodic acid, Schiff 's reagent: Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,Germany) was performed, and to obtain a histological overview,hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) of livers and spleens wasconducted, using standard protocols (McManus, 1948; Fischeret al., 2008). Identification of the specific cell types was based ontheir microscopic features along with the relative location of thecells in the respective tissues.Cell Culture ExperimentsCellsPeripheral blood (Institute for Transfusion Medicine, JenaUniversity Hospital, Jena, Germany) was collected from healthyadult donors who had not taken any anti-inflammatory drugsduring the last 10 days. The protocols for experiments withhuman monocytes were approved by the ethical committeeof the Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Jena, Germany, onMarch 19, 2014; approval number: 4025-02/14. All methodswere performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines andregulations. Leukocyte concentrates were centrifuged (4000 x g,20 min, 20*C) and PBMCs were freshly isolated by dextransedimentation and centrifugation on lymphocyte separationmedium (Histopaque R(c)-1077, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,Germany). Resulting PBMCs were seeded in RPMI 1640(Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) supplemented with 10%heat inactivated FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/mlstreptomycin in cell culture flasks (Greiner Bio-one, Nuertingen,Germany) for 1-1.5 h at 37*C, 5% CO2. Adherent monocyteswere washed twice with PBS and finally harvested by cellscraping.Cytokine MeasurementIn order to determine the effect of Casp on cytokine release,1.5 x 106 monocytes/ml in RPMI 1640 (supplemented with5% heat inactivated FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/mlstreptomycin) were pre-incubated for 30 min with vehicle(0.2% DMSO) or 30 ug/ml Casp after allowing for monocyteadhesion for 1.5 h at 37*C and 5% CO2. Cells were stimulatedwith 10 ng/ml LPS for distinct intervals (TNF-a, IL-8: 4 h;IL-6, IL-10: 18 h), and cytokines released into the mediumwere measured using specific Quantikine ELISA Kits (R&DSystems, Minneapolis, MN, United States). The glucocorticoiddexamethasone (1uM; Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) wasused as positive control.MTT AssayTo exclude cytotoxic effects of Casp, monocytes were dilutedto 2 x 106/ml in RPMI 1640 (containing 5% heat inactivatedFCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 ug/ml streptomycin) andseeded in a 96-well plate. Monocytes were allowed to adherefor 1.5 h at 37*C and 5% CO2 prior to treatment with vehicle(0.5% DMSO) or extract (30 ug/ml) in 100 ul of mediumfor 24 h. Afterward, cells were incubated with thiazolyl bluetetrazolium bromide solution (MTT, 5 mg/ml PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) until blue staining of the control.Formazan formation was stopped by adding 100 ul SDS-lysisbuffer (10%, w/v in 20 mM HCl, pH 4.5) and the well plateswere shaken at room temperature overnight. Finally, absorbancewas measured at 570 nm with a MultiskanTM microplatespectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Ulm, Germany). Thepan-protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (1 uM; Calbiochem,La Jolla, CA, United States) was used as positive (cytotoxic)control.Statistical AnalysisFor statistical analysis, the IBM SPSS statistics program (version22.0) was used. In all cases, animal experiments were performedwith eight mice per treatment group. Statistical significance wasdetermined by using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test,followed by the Mann-Whitney U-test with Holm-Bonferronicorrection. A p-value <= 0.05 was considered statisticallysignificant. Data are given as mean+- standard error of the mean(SEM).Cell culture experiments were conducted in triplicate. Dataare given as means +- SEM. Statistically significant differences incomparison to LPS-stimulated control cells were determined byone-way ANOVA plus Bonferroni post hoc test and are denotedas follows: *p <= 0.05; **p <= 0.01; ***p <= 0.001.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387124fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 5Loeser et al.

Twenty-four hours after treatment, the health statusof LPS-challenged mice was distinctly impaired (Figure 1A).Additionally, body temperature was significantly decreased byan average of 2.6*C (mean control value: 37.2*C). Blood glucoselevels were even diminished by more than 50% when comparedwith control animals (Figures 1B,C). In all cases, Casp was able tosignificantly ameliorate LPS-induced effects, whereas soy lecithin(solvent control, devoid of frankincense) showed no protectiveimpact. Mice receiving soy lecithin or Casp alone displayed norelevant differences to the control group.In comparison to controls, LPS challenge caused an averagedecrease in b.wt. by 14% (Figure 1D) and in liver and thymusweights by 12 and 25%, respectively, whereas spleen and adrenalweights were increased by 23% (Figures 1E,F). Weights of brain,kidney, and heart, in contrast, remained unaffected (data notshown). Treatment with soy lecithin or Casp alone caused adecrease in spleen weights by 15 and 22% (p = 0.071; p = 0.007)and in thymus weights by 21 and 29% (p = 0.066; p = 0.016),respectively (Figure 1E), with no overt histological changes inthese organs. While administration of soy lecithin had no effecton LPS-mediated changes in body and organ weights, Casp wasable to significantly return the LPS-induced increase in spleenand adrenal weights to control values (Figures 1E,F). Thymusweights, in contrast, remained significantly reduced not only byadditional soy lecithin treatment, but also by co-administrationof Casp by 39 and 34% (p = 0.006; p = 0.007), respectively, whichwas not statistically different from the weight reduction observedafter sole LPS treatment (p = 0.167; p = 0.264; data not shown).Serum Cytokine and ALAT LevelsTo evaluate the impact of Casp on LPS-induced alterations incirculating cytokine levels, serum concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 as well as of theanti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured at sacrifice(Figures 2A-C). Compared to control animals, administration ofLPS caused an elevation of serum TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10 valuesby about 120, 670, and 70%, respectively, whereas sole treatmentwith soy lecithin or Casp had no effect. Co-administration ofCasp was able to reduce the LPS-induced increase in serum TNF-a and IL-6 levels by about 30 and 50%, respectively, whereas IL-10values were slightly further elevated. Co-administration of soylecithin, in contrast, had no influence on LPS effects.As a parameter indicating liver damage, serum ALAT levelswere determined (Figure 2D). Here, LPS treatment caused adistinct increase by about 140% compared to controls. Sole soylecithin or Casp administration, in contrast, had no influenceon serum ALAT concentration and no effect of soy lecithin co-treatment on LPS-induced liver damage was noted.
