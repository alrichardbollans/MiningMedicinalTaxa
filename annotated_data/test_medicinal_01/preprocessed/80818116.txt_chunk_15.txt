Since the audit of prophylax-is was conducted for previous 24 hours, surgical depart-ments were not audited on Monday. Data were collected from patient's medical record, including treatment cards, laboratory results and other official medical documents. Daily hospitalizations and outpatients, defined as ambula-tory care patients and emergency admissions on the day of the survey were excluded from the survey. Denominator data included all eligible inpatients on the day of survey. All the data were entered online using Global-PPS web based tool. After that data were validated and analyzed.Results and discussionOn the day of the survey 1468 beds were available, with an occupancy rate of 63.56%. The total number of patients included in the survey was 933: 768 (82.31%) adults, 77 (8.26%) pediatric and 88 (9.43%) neonatal patients. Overall, from the total number of hospitalized patients, 325 (34.8%) patients received at least one antibiotic: adults 32.3%, children 54.5% and neonates 39.8% of respective patients. Top 3 diagnoses for treatment, excluding prophy-lactic treatment, NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) and NMW (Neonatal Medical Ward) patients, were Pneu (25.2%), Bron (15.4%) and TB (13.8%).The majority of patients received parenteral antibiotics (89.2%). 26.3% of patients had multiple antibiotic diagno-sis and 26.7% were identified as multiple antibiotic patients. 95% of patients that received antibiotics were treated S1 PP 3076Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 75 - 76 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsempirically. The most prescribed group of antibiotics in UCCK were other beta-lactam antibiotics with 51.8% (ATC J01D), followed by aminoglycosides 15.1% (ATC J01G) and other antibiotics 14.4% (ATC J01X).Overall 32 different types of antibiotics were pre-scribed; cefazolin was the most prescribed one (21.9%), followed by ceftriaxone (16.0%) and gentamicin (7.8%). Analysis of quality indicators of antibiotic prescribing for adults and children in our survey showed that there were no treatment protocols and no stop/review dates documented. On the other hand, reason in notes was documented in most of antibiotic prescriptions. Community acquired infections (CAI) constituted 85.3% of antibiotic prescriptions, whereas hospital ac-quired infections (HAI), 14.7%. Prophylactic treatment was more pronounced in surgical prophylaxis 74.7%, in comparison with medical prophylaxis 25.3%. Our survey showed that in UCCK duration of prophy-lactic treatment was more than 1 day in all cases.Antibiotic use among children is considerably high-er than 36.7% result from the ARPEC PPS study of 2012 (Verspoten et al., 2016) and results from the Antibiotic Re-sistance and Prescribing in European Children Point Prev-alence Survey (ARPEC-PPS, 2011) conducted in Europe-an (35.4; 95% CI: 33.6-37.2%) and non-European hospi-tals (43.8%; 95%CI: 41.3-46.3%) (Versporten et al., 2013).What stands out from our results is high percentage of antibiotics used for the treatment of tuberculosis (13.8%), which suggests high prevalence of tuberculosis in Koso-vo and it is a concerning fact for our public health system. Parenteral antibiotic administration was significantly greater than European results from (ECDC, 2013; ESAC, 2009) where parenteral prescription for adults and children was 70.6% (country range: 47.8-91.4%). Empiric prescription of antibiotics was unacceptably high. Reasons for this may be various, i.e. Clinical Mi-crobiology Laboratory is a part of Public Health Institute and not within the hospital, and another contributing factor may be the lack of sufficient collaboration between clini-cists and microbiologists. Antibiotic prescription based on susceptibility testing is considered as an important factor in raising the success rate of treatment as well as in shorten-ing the time of hospital stay. In Europe prescribing patterns are characterized by very common use of the combination penicillins, mainly co-amoxiclav (11% of all antimicrobial agents) in 79.2% of 17 European Hospitals (2000 - 2005) (Zarb et al., 2011).Our survey showed that cephalosporin's were the most used group of antibiotics in UCCK, which is not in line with recommendations of WHO. High level of cefazolin prescription, an older 1st generation cephalosporin, devi-ates from the recommendation on ceftriaxone use from the cephalosporin group. Results show quite high aminoglycoside prescription (15.1%). Actual recommendations on their prescription suggest to be as restrictive as possible and in strict thera-peutic monitoring (Avent et al., 2011).Overall, it is noted that antibiotic prescription patterns in UCCK are in contradiction with approved WHO rec-ommendations, which recommend prescription of narrow spectrum antibiotics, targeted therapy and implementation of restrictive policies (WHO, 2011). Also, of great concern is the fact that medical and sur-gical prophylactic use of antibiotics in UCCK is more than 1 day in all recorded cases, which suggest the need for es-tablishing proper prophylactic protocols. ConclusionAntibiotic prescription in UCCK hospitalized patients deviates from rational prescribing standards. Data from this survey will be an important tool in identifying goals for quality improvement in UCCK and Kosovo and to sup-port preparation of guidelines and protocols for prudent use of antibiotics.ReferencesAvent, M.L., Rogers, B.A., Cheng, A.C., Paterson, D.L., 2011.

Ju-dicious use of antibiotics is essential to slow the emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria and extend the useful lifetime of effective antibiotics (Goossens, 2009). The importance of surveillance data with regard to an-timicrobial use and resistance at local and national levels and the role of antibiotic stewardship is emphasized by the 2011 European Commission Action Plan against rising threats from antimicrobial resistance (COM, 2011).A simple and feasible way to assess antibiotic con-sumption is using a point prevalence survey (PPS).Kosovo is a part of global efforts to combat irratio-nal antibiotic use and accompanying bacterial resistance through the Global PPS program. As part of this nation-al and global program, we conducted the survey in region-al hospital Prizren.The study aimed to describe antibiotic prescribing practices among hospitalized patients in regional hospital (RH) in Prizren, among adults, children and neonates and to identify targets for improvement of the quality of anti-biotic prescribing. Materials and methodsThe survey was implemented in June 2015. The sur-vey included all inpatients from all wards admitted at 8 o'clock. Detailed data were collected only for patients who were being treated with antibiotic on the day of survey. These data included gender, age, weight (children and ne-onates), antibiotic used (type, dose, dosage, route of ad-ministration), type of treatment (empiric, targeted), reason for treatment (community acquired infection CAI, hospi-tal acquired infection HAI, surgical or medical prophy-laxis), use of treatment protocols, reason in notes. Surgi-cal prophylaxis was encoded as single dose, 1 day or more than one day prophylactic prescribing. Since the audit of prophylaxis was conducted for previous 24 hours, surgical departments were not audited on Monday. Data were col-lected from official patient's medical record. Daily hospi-talizations and outpatients, defined as ambulatory care pa-tients and emergency admissions on the day of the survey were excluded from the survey. Denominator data includ-ed all eligible inpatients on the day of survey. All the data were entered online using Global-PPS web based tool, af-ter what data were validated and analyzed.Results and discussionTotal number of patients included in the survey was 232. 47% of them received an antibiotic, 200 adults (43% treated with antibiotics), 18 children (83.3% treated with antibiotics) and 14 neonates (57.1% treated with antibiot-ics). Two most frequent diagnoses for treatment with anti-biotics were ENT (ear-nose-throat infections) and TB (tu-berculosis) with 17.7% each. Parenteral antibiotic prescrip-tion was 95.8% in total. Empiric prescribing was domi-nant (91.3%) in comparison to targeted treatment. Most prescribed groups of antibiotics in RH Prizren were oth-er beta-lactams 57.1% (ATC J01D), followed by amino-glycosides 18.3% (ATC J01G) and penicillins 15.9% (ATC S1 PP 3178Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 77 - 78 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsJ01C). Top 3 AB prescribed were ceftriaxone 42.9%, gen-tamicin 9.3% and ampicillin 8%. Investigation of quality indicators for antibiotic prescribing in adults and children in RH Prizren showed a consistent lack of treatment pro-tocols and documentation of stop/review date of antibiot-ic treatment. Reason for treatment was documented in al-most all cases. Community acquired infections were the main reason for treatment (93.9%); health care infections (6.1%). 71.2% of prophylactic prescribing was for surgical prophylaxis, and 28.8% for medical prophylaxis. In terms of duration of prophylactic treatment, all patients were treated for more than one day. Regional hospital Prizren is a secondary type hospital and one of the largest in Kosovo. Antibiotic use in pediatric (83.3%), neonatal (57.1%) and in adult (43%) patients is very high, when compared with numbers from ECDC report, according to which 35% of patients received at least one antibiotic (country range 21.4%-54.7%) (ECDC, 2013), results from ARPEC PPS from 2012, according to which the mean antibiotic use in European children was 36.7% (Verspoten et. al, 2016) and results from (ARPEC-PPS, 2011) conducted in European (35.4; 95% CI: 33.6-37.2%) and non-European hospitals (43.8%; 95%CI: 41.3-46.3%) (Versporten et al.,2013). An-tibiotic use in children hospitalized in RH Prizren is sig-nificantly higher than in European hospitals, especially in medical wards (83.3% vs. 39.5%, according to ARPEC-PPS 2012). What stands out in RH Prizren is the top place for tuberculosis treatment, alongside ear-nose-throat infec-tions, which is quite concerning. When compared to European hospitals, RH Prizren has a very high percentage of parenteral antibiotic prescription (95.8%). Studies conducted in Europe show that paren-teral prescription in adults and children is 70.6% (country range: 47.8-91.4%) (ECDC, 2013; ESAC, 2009). Total empiric prescribing was very high resulting from different reasons common in Kosovo's health system, such as low capacities of clinical microbiology laboratories, lack of collaboration between clinicians and microbiolo-gists, scarce funding of laboratories etc. As prescription based on susceptibility testing is one of the cornerstones of prudent antibiotic use we recommend urgent measures to improve this anomaly.Excessive use of ceftriaxone (42.9%) is an indicator of a irrational antibiotic prescription which needs to be ad-dressed, due to impact on triggering bacterial resistance, particularly for ESBL strains (extended spectrum beta-lac-tamase) (Skrlin et al., 2011). Results show high rate of ami-noglycoside prescribing, which are the second most pre-scribed group with 15.1%. Actual recommendations rec-ommend that prescription of this group of antibiotics be as restrictive as possible and in strict therapeutic monitoring. Narrow spectrum antibiotics (benzylpenicillin, erythromy-cin, azithromycin, clarithromycin), targeted treatment and implementation of restrictive policies on antibiotic pre-scription, recommended by WHO, are not applied in RH Prizren. The lack of treatment protocols and documenta-tion of stop/review date greatly impacts the quality of an-tibiotic prescribing, so we recommend urgent measures to correct these quality indicators.ConclusionAntibiotic prescribing in RH Prizren is not accord-ing to standards. Data gathered from this survey will help to identify targets to improve the quality of antibiotic pre-scription within the hospital. ReferencesECDC, 2013.
