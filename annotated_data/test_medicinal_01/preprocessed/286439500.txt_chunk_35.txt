The latter substance is known as a potent vasoprotectivefactor inhibiting platelet adhesion and thrombus formation onendothelium (Weiss and Turitto, 1979). In addition, feeding ofrats with pomegranate extract diminished in colonic mucosalevels of COX-2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as well as induciblenitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Larrosa et al., 2010b).Some other works investigated how pomegranate affectsarterial hypertension, an important risk factor for cardiovasculardiseases (Pickering, 1972). For example, in a study involvedthe use of Wistar rats in which diabetes was induced bystreptozotocin administration, and the animals were additionallychallenged by a subcutaneous administration of angiotensin II toinduce hypertension, a prolonged administration of pomegranatejuice (for 4 weeks) reduced activity of angiotensin convertingenzyme (ACE), as well as decreased mean arterial blood pressurein comparison with non-treated animals (Mohan et al., 2010).Pomegranate fruit extracts were also studied regarding theirprotective effect against cardiac toxicity induced by drugs orsmoking. For example, detrimental effects of a cardiotoxic drugisoproterenol (known to cause a cardiac necrosis leading toa myocardial infarction) were reduced upon pre-treatment ofrats with pomegranate juice for 30 consecutive days beforeisoproterenol treatment (Jadeja et al., 2010). Such pre-treatmentsignificantly lessened an increase in the heart weight, infarctionsize, plasma marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation levels as wellas levels of Ca2+ ATPase (Jadeja et al., 2010). The protectiveeffects of pomegranate juice intake were also demonstratedin a study using rats in which a cardiac hypertrophywas induced by cigarette smoke exposure (Al Hariri et al.,2016).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 54490Wang et al. Vasculoprotective Effects of PomegranatePomegranate Seed OilPomegranate seeds comprise about 3% of the pomegranateweight and contain about 12-20% seed oil (Lansky and Newman,2007) that is rich in fatty acids and contains mainly punicic acid(Kaufman and Wiesman, 2007; Verardo et al., 2014; Gornas' andRudzinska, 2016).In rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, oral feedingwith seed extracts significantly reduced blood glucose levels(Das et al., 2001). In mice, an intake of pomegranate seedoil counteracted their obesity induced by a high-fat diet byenhancing peripheral insulin sensitivity (Vroegrijk et al., 2011).Oral treatment of the above cited diabetic rats with pomegranateseed oil significantly decreased peroxidation of plasma lipids(Mollazadeh et al., 2016). In addition, such treatment diminishedmalondialdehyde content in homogenates from the heart andkidney tissues, and reduced triglyceride levels in treated animalsin comparison to the control cohort (Mollazadeh et al.,2016).Pomegranate Flower, Peel, and LeafExtractsA 6-week oral administration of pomegranate flower extractssuppressed plasma glucose levels in Zucker diabetic fattyrats following their exposure to glucose-loading. In addition,such treatment in these animals increased cardiac peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-g) mRNAexpression as well as restored the down-regulated cardiac glucosetransporter (GLUT)-4 mRNA, altogether improving insulinsensitivity (Huang et al., 2005a). These beneficial effects wereassigned mainly to the presence of gallic acid (Huang et al.,2005a). A long-term treatment of Zucker diabetic fatty rats withpomegranate flower extracts was cardioprotective, as it loweredtheir fatty acid-, triglycerides-, and total cholesterol plasma levelsas well as reduced the cardiac triglycerides content (Huang et al.,2005b). In another study, oral administration of pomegranateflower extracts decreased plasma glucose levels in non-fasteddiabetic rats (but not in fasted-diabetic rats or in normal rats).This study also showed that pomegranate flower extracts inhibita-glucosidase (a key enzyme for carbohydrate digestion inintestines) and administration of pomegranate flower extractsmay improve postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, andaltogether diminish the risk of cardiovascular dysfunctions (Liet al., 2005). In mice fed with a high-fat diet to induce obesity,treatment with pomegranate leaf extract decreased body weight,energy intake as well as total cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucoselevels (Lei et al., 2007). Administration of hydroalcoholic peel orleaf extracts of pomegranate for 28 days decreased blood glucoselevels in aWister rat model of diabetes induced by streptozotocin(Salwe et al., 2015). Hydroalcoholic peel extracts of pomegranatewere also tested in spontaneously hypertensive ovariectomizedfemale rats (an animal model for menopause characterized byan increase in the superoxide anion levels; Delgado et al., 2016).Such treatment diminished elevation of superoxide anion levelsand lessened oxidative stress in this animal model (Delgado et al.,2016). Treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats of differentages for 30 days with pomegranate peel extracts, significantlyreduced systolic blood pressure, ACE activity, oxidative stressas well as vascular remodeling (Dos Santos et al., 2016). Arecent in vitro study showed that pomegranate peel methanolicextracts potently scavenge superoxide and hydroxyl radicals,protect LDL against oxidation and suppress ACE activity (Arunet al., 2017). Altogether, these studies demonstrated that alsothe non-edible parts of pomegranate--peel and leaves--exhibitvasculoprotective effects.VASCULOPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OFPURE COMPOUNDS DERIVED FROMPOMEGRANATEStudies presented above showed the numerous vasculoprotectiveeffects of different parts of the pomegranate. It was suggestedthat many of these protective effects are caused by the presenceof hydrolyzable tannins (ellagitannins and gallotannins), theirderivative ellagic acid, or their common metabolites urolithins(Table 3 and the text below).Pomegranate ellagitannins and a single high molecularweight ellagitannin punicalagin, attenuated the inflammatory cellsignaling in colon cancer cells (Adams et al., 2006). Punicalaginand gallic acid induced in isolated macrophages the expression ofparaoxonase 2 (Shiner et al., 2007). These substances also reducedoxidative stress in macrophages via activation of transcriptionfactors PPAR-g and activator protein 1 (AP-1; Shiner et al.,2007).Single components (e.g., punicalin, punicalagin, ellagic acid,and gallic acid) isolated from pomegranate fruit suppressedthe formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs,known to contribute to a number of diseases includingdiabetic complications and arteriosclerosis) from bovineserum albumin and sugar in antiglycation assays in vitro(Kumagai et al., 2015). Pomegranate fruit extracts alsoreduced the accumulation of AGEs in mice fed with ahigh-fat and high-sucrose diet (Kumagai et al., 2015).In addition, punicalagin and ellagic acid inhibited lipidmetabolism in mouse and human adipocytes ex vivo (Les et al.,2017).Effects of ellagic acid on reactive oxygen species (ROS)generation were also investigated in endothelial cells. Pre-treatment of HUVECs with ellagic acid attenuated ROSproduction and prevented eNOS downregulation inducedby oxLDL (Lee et al., 2010; Ou et al., 2010). Ex vivo,ellagic acid stimulated vasorelaxation of the rat thoracicaorta via an endothelium-dependent mechanism and aninhibition of calcium influx (Yilmaz and Usta, 2013).Nevertheless, as ellagitannins and ellagic acid in vivometabolize into urolithins that enter systemic circulation(Cerdaet al., 2005; Larrosa et al., 2010a), researchersalso studied how these metabolites affect the vascularfunction.The antioxidant properties of different urolithins wereevaluated in a cell-based assay and the results showed thaturolithin C and D were more potent antioxidants than theparental substance ellagic acid and punicalagin (Bialonska et al.,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 54491Wang et al.
