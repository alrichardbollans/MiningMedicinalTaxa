The urgent need for novel antimycotics called particular attention to thestudy of natural products. The genus Hypericum includes many species that are usedin the traditional medicine to treat pathological states like inflammations and infectionscaused by fungi. However, despite the diffused use of Hypericum-based products theantifungal potential of the genus is still poorly investigated. In this study five Hypericumspecies autochthonous of Central and Eastern Europe were evaluated regarding theirpolyphenolic content, their toxicological safety and their antifungal potential against abroad panel of clinical fungal isolates. LC-MS analysis led to the identification andquantification of 52 compounds, revealing that Hypericum extracts are rich sourcesof flavonols, benzoates and cinnamates, and of flavan-3-ols. An in-depth screen ofthe biological activity of crude extracts clearly unveiled H. hircinum subsp. majus as apromising candidate species for the search of novel antifungals. H. hircinum is diffusedin the Mediterranean basin from Spain to Turkey where it is traditionally used to prepare aherbal tea indicated for the treatment of respiratory tract disorders, several of which arecaused by fungi. Noteworthy, the infusion of H. hircinum subsp. majus excreted broadantifungal activity against Penicillium, Aspergillus and non-albicans Candida isolatescomprising strains both sensitive and resistant to fluconazole. Additionally, it showedno cytotoxicity on human cells and the chemical characterization of the H. hircinumsubsp. majus infusion revealed high amounts of the metabolite hyperoside. These resultsscientifically support the traditional use of H. hircinum extracts for the treatment ofrespiratory tract infections and suggest the presence of exploitable antifungal principlesfor further investigations aimed at developing novel antifungal therapies.Keywords: Hypericum, antifungal, Candida, cytotoxicity, LC-MS, phenolic compoundsAbbreviations: CFU, colony forming units; GM, geometric mean; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry;MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 382139fphar-09-00382 April 20, 2018 Time: 12:10 # 2Tocci et al. Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal ExtractsINTRODUCTIONThe rising incidence of fungal infections is an emerging serioushealth problem, especially in cases of immune compromisedpatients caused either by diseases like AIDS, or by cancertherapies and prolonged antibiotic treatments (Lass-Florl, 2009;Weil et al., 2017). Estimates of global mortality rates suggest thatfungi are responsible for more deaths than either tuberculosisor malaria (Brown et al., 2012). Millions more suffer fromsevere illness caused by chronic or allergic fungal infections.Candidiasis is the most prevalent fungal disease worldwidedifficult and extremely costly to treat (World Health Organization[WHO], 2014). The available antifungal drugs like polyenes,pyrimidines, azoles, and echinocandins often provoke significanttoxicity including fever, nausea and vomiting, dose-limitingnephrotoxicity, liver toxicity, and controversial interactions withco-administered drugs (Dismukes, 2000; Zager, 2000). Anothercrucial problem is represented by the increasing rate of drugresistance that invalidates the clinical treatments. The alarminggap in the anti-fungal pipeline makes the discovery of newactive compounds a priority for the scientific community. Thestrong request of new classes of compounds has renewedthe interest in the screening of natural products (Abreuet al., 2012; Atanasov et al., 2016). Especially, ethnobotanyrepresents an important guide in the search of novel antifungalagents. Due to their ability to synthesize a limitless varietyof chemical structures, plants have represented a source ofbioactive remedies for centuries (Arif et al., 2009). Despite ofthis, it is estimated that only a small proportion of plantsare used by humans. Therefore, bioactivity screening programsand research on new plant-derived compounds are of primeimportance for the search of novel leads. Plants belongingto the genus Hypericum, are characteristic components of theEuropean flora. In particular, Europe and the Mediterraneanbasin represent a hot spot of diversity for Hypericum species(Nurk and Crockett, 2011). The best characterized species isH. perforatum L., which was already described by Hippocratesas a remedy against possession in the Ancient Greece (Dugouaet al., 2006). During the centuries it has been used forthe treatment of various pathological states, like neurologicaldisorders, wounds, inflammations, and infections. The useof H. perforatum extracts is so popular that this species isconsidered the most important medicinal plant of the 20thcentury (Gurib-Fakim, 2006). The German Commission Eapproved its usage for several indications, including treatmentand post-therapy of acute and contused injuries, myalgia andfirst-degree burns as well as dyspeptic complaints (Arsic et al.,2010). In the Balkan Countries it is considered as one ofthe oldest remedies and in the Serbian folk medicine it isindicated for the treatment of cuts, burns, hemorrhoids andalso as an antiseptic, for liver and stomach complaints, diarrhea,and gastric ulcers. Its sale represents a huge part of theoverall herbal market (Crockett et al., 2011), exceeding $570million/annum worldwide (Ayan et al., 2006). Regarding itsantifungal potential, inhibitory properties against Candida spp.,(Tocci et al., 2013) and fungal plant pathogens (Crockett et al.,2011) have been reported. Nevertheless, a growing number ofscientific evidences underlines the importance to investigateother Hypericum species that might exert a more promisingantifungal activity (Radulovic' et al., 2007; Stojanovic et al., 2013).In this regard the species H. carinatum, H. myrianthum, H.linoides (Barros et al., 2013), H. garciae (Tocci et al., 2018a) havebeen shown to have the potential to inhibit the growth of Candidaspp. Cryptococcus neoformans and Rhodotorula mucilaginosagrowth.In Central and Eastern Europe several different Hypericumspecies co-occur and the area is considered a significant source ofplant material for the market of herbal products (Raclariu et al.,2017).Amongst others, H. maculatum Crantz subsp. maculatum,H. hircinum L. s. lat., H. hirsutum L., and H. montanumL., as plants used to treat wounds, skin inflammations andburns (Menkovic et al., 2011), as well as infections of therespiratory (Sagratini et al., 2008) and urinary tract (Saric'-Kundalic' et al., 2010). These pathologies are often causedby fungi, with Candida as the main causative agent and bydermatophytes in the case of external infections (Borgers et al.,2005; Johnson, 2012; Ritchie and Eltahawy, 2014). To screen fornew candidates suitable for the development of novel antimycoticsolutions, we studied extracts deriving from the aerial partsof several Hypericum taxa (H. perforatum L., H. maculatumCrantz subsp. maculatum, H. hircinum L. s.lat., H. hirsutum L.,and H. montanum L.) with respect to their chemical profile,their antifungal activity against a broad panel of clinical fungalisolates of the human gut and their toxicological safety onhuman skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs).MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant MaterialSamples of H. hirsutum subsp. hirsutum, H. hircinum subsp.majus, H. maculatum, H. montanum, and H. perforatumhave been collected during spring-summer of 2015 in theAlpine region (Northern-Eastern Italy). Species were identifiedaccording to the most recent Flora of Italy (Pignatti, 1982,2017), nomenclature follows Bartolucci et al. (2018) andtype specimens were deposited in the Department of FoodQuality and Nutrition at the Fondazione Edmund Machin San Michele all'Adige, Trento, Italy (Reference number:NT0001 H. perforatum, NT0002 H. montanum, NT0003H. maculatum, NT0004 H. hirsutum, NT0005 H. hircinum subsp.majus).Preparation of Crude Plant ExtractsFor each species, 500 mg of dried plant biomass, representedby stems and leaves, were powdered by grinding and extractedin the dark with methanol (drug/solvent ratio = 1:20 w/v) bymaceration (3 x 24 h). H. hircinum subsp. majus was alsosubjected to extractions with boiling water (100*C) for 20 min,and ethanol 80% by maceration for 24 h. The obtained extractswere evaporated to dryness, weighed and stored at -20*C untilanalysis.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 382140fphar-09-00382 April 20, 2018 Time: 12:10 # 3Tocci et al. Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal ExtractsPreparation of Samples for ChemicalAnalysisPrior to analysis methanolic extracts were resuspended in50% methanol/water and filtered using sterile (0.2 um) PTFEfilters.LC-MS AnalysisAnalysis of phenolic metabolites was performed using aWaters Acquity UPLC system (Milford, MA, United States)which consists of a binary pump, an online vacuum degasser,an autosampler and a column compartment as previouslydescribed (Vrhovsek et al., 2012). Phenolic compounds wereseparated at a temperature of 40*C on a Waters AcquityHSS T3 column 1.8 um, 150 mm x 2.1 mm (Milford,MA, United States). The mobile phase was composed ofcomponent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and component B(0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Acetonitrile was of LC-MSgrade and was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,United States). Pure standards of hypericin from Hypericumperforatum ~95% (HPLC), hyperoside and hyperforin werepurchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States).Milli-Q water was used for the chromatography. The flowwas set to 0.4 mL/min, and the gradient profile was: 0 min,5% B; from 0 to 3 min, linear gradient to 20% B; from3 to 4.3 min, isocratic 20% B; from 4.3 to 9 min, lineargradient to 45% B; from 9 to 11 min, linear gradient to100% B; from 11 to 13 min, wash at 100% B; from 13.01to 15 min, the re-equilibrated to the initial conditions of5% B. Analysis of hypericin, hyperforin and hyperoside wasperformed using the same Waters Acquity UPLC system(Milford, MA, United States) and conditions, by means of adifferent gradient. The gradient profile in this case was: 0 min,10% B; from 0 to 4,5 min, linear gradient to 100% B; from4,5 to 12 min, isocratic 100% B; finally the column was re-equilibrated to the initial conditions of 10% B for 4 min.MRM transitions for hypericin, hyperforin and hyperoside arereported in Supplementary Table S1. Each sample was analyzedin triplicate. Samples were kept at 6*C during the analysis. Massspectrometry detection for both methods was performed on aWaters Xevo TQMS (Milford, MA, United States) instrumentequipped with an electrospray (ESI) source. Capillary voltagewas 3.5 kV in positive mode and -2.5 kV in negative mode;the source was kept at 150*C; the desolvation temperaturewas 500*C; cone gas flow, 50 L/h; and desolvation gas flow,800 L/h. Further MS parameters are reported in Vrhovsek et al.,2012.Data AnalysisQuantification was done using Waters MassLynx 4.1 andTargetLynx software.Microorganisms and MediaFor antifungal susceptibility testing, the reference strainC. albicans ATCC MYA-2876 from the American Type CultureCollection (ATCC), Rockville, MD, United States was used. Thehuman gut clinical isolates, C. albicans YN7, C. parapsilosis YB1,C. parapsilosis YB3 (Di Paola et al., unpublished), C. albicansYHS254, C. albicans YHS89, C. lusitaniae YHS217, C. lusitaniaeYHS72, C. parapsilosis YHS133, C. parapsilosis YHS312,C. parapsilosis YHS301, Aspergillus glaucus YHS165, Penicilliumpaneum YHS245 (Strati et al., 2016), C. glabrata MFB004,C. tropicalis MFB035-1, C. tropicalis RTT037-3 (Strati et al.,unpublished) were tested for their susceptibility against theapplied drugs. All strains were grown on Sabouraud agarizedmedium for 48 h at 30*C before testing.Antifungal Susceptibility TestingCandida strains were tested for their susceptibility toHypericum spp. extracts (7 dilution series, ranging from500 to 8 ug/ml) following the European Committee forAntimicrobial Susceptibility Testing protocol (EUCASTDEFINITIVE DOCUMENT EDef 7.2 Revision; EuropeanCommittee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, 2012).Briefly, cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium supplied with2.0% glucose, counted and inoculated at a concentrationof 1-5 x 105 CFU/ml. MIC50 and MIC90 values weredetermined at 530 nm using a spectrophotometer, as thelowest concentration of the drug that resulted in >=50% and>=90% inhibition of growth relative to the growth control after48 h incubation.PBMC IsolationPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained frombuffy coat of healthy donors (as approved by the EthicalCommittee of the local health centre, Azienda Provincialeper I Servizi Sanitari, Provincia Autonoma di Trento)within 4 h from sample collection. PBMC isolation wasperformed using Lympholite (CEDARLANE) density gradient(1.077 g/liter, pH 6,9), according to manufacturer's instructions,and incubated in complete nutrient RPMI 1640 medium(Euroclone) supplemented with glutamine (2 mol/L), 10%fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics (10000 U/ml Penicillin,10000 ug/ml Streptomycin) (Biological Industries), at 37*C and5% CO2.Cytotoxicity AssayThe cytotoxicity of H. hircinum subsp.
