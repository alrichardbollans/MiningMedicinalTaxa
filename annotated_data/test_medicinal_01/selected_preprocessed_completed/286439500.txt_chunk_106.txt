sinensis not being available or affordable to the vast majorityof population, local surrogates/substitutes of tea have been usedfor centuries. The best known tea surrogates were preparedfrom fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium L.) and, in Siberia -Bergenia spp. (Tcherepnin, 1987; Pohlebkin, 1998; Shikov et al.,2006, 2014b; Soukand et al., 2013). Prior to the introductionof oriental (black or green) tea in Europe, E. angustifoliumwas esteemed as the "original Russian tea" and used widelythroughout Russia and beyond (Litvintsev and Koscheev, 1988;Soukand et al., 2013). However, this botanical drug is not inthe Russian Pharmacopoeia. Extracts of black and fermentedleaves of B. crassifolia are reported as appetite and energy intakesuppressants (Shikov et al., 2012). Other species that are usedas substitutes for tea in Russia belong to different families. Firstof all they are expected to bring delicious flavor, taste and nicecolor to the tea. Marsh Labrador tea (Ledum palustre L.), thyme(Thymus serpyllum L.), wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.), arehighly aromatic. Aerial parts of Saint John's wort (Hypericumperforatum L.), oregano, thyme, leaves of lingonberry (Vacciniumvitis-idaea L.), flowers of linden (Tilia cordata Mill. and T.platyphyllos Scop.) are among the most popular components ofherbal teas in Russia (Krylov, 1972; Koscheev, 1981; Sokolov,1985; Grisjuk et al., 1989; Efremova, 1992; Kalle and Soukand,2012). Dry fruits of rose hips, hawthorn, and rowan are usedas substitutes of tea (Gubanov et al., 1976; Tcherepnin, 1987;Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001). Ethnobotanical data alsolists dried and roasted rhizomes of dandelion (Taraxacumcampylodes G.E. Haglund), dry seeds of guelder rose, roastedfruits of hawthorn, and fruits of R. canina L.as coffee substitutes(Klobukova-Alisova, 1958; Vul'f and Maleeva, 1969; Koscheev,1981; Sokolov, 1990, 1993).Seasoning, SpicesAromatic herbs are very important part of local gastronomy,especial for seasoning and as spices in southern Russia. Inparticular, sweet flag (A. calamus L.), valerian (Valerianaofficinalis L.), elecampane (Inula helenium L.) roots andrhizomes, juniper (Juniperus communis L.), and caraway (Carumcarvi L.) fruits, dwarf everlast (Helichrysum arenarium (L.)Moench) and tansy flowers, yarrow, oregano, thyme, andartemisia aerial parts are normally used as aroma and flavorenhancer or digestives (Sokolov, 1988, 1994; Berson, 1991;Mashanov and Pokrovsky, 1991). These species are used bothin culinary preparations at home: they are added to the soupsand main dishes, salads, meats, bakery, as well as in the foodindustry in the production of sausages, confectionery and bakeryproducts.SweetsThe Russian make a kind of sweet flag and elecampane candiedpeel by boiling the transverse root slices in syrup, and drying(Gubanov et al., 1976; Koscheev, 1981; Berson, 1991). Candiedfruits of hawthorn, bird cherry, guelder rose are used assweetness (Gubanov et al., 1976; Koscheev, 1981; Tcherepnin,1987; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001).Bread SurrogatesIn the eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth centuryflour and products like bread derived from it were the mainfoods for Russian peasants. Consequently, every an extendedperiod of bad weather resulting in crop failure resulted in large-scale famines. This explains why a vast variety of plant partswas used for filling bread, including roots, fruits, leaves, andbarks. Roots and rhizomes of some plants are known to be goodsources of starch and carbohydrates. Powdered roots of Persicariabistorta (L.) Samp. were added to the rye flour for baking bread(Rubtsov, 1971; Fedorov, 1984; Tcherepnin, 1987). Bergeniarhizomes were eaten as a substitute for bread (Vereschagin et al.,1959; Tcherepnin, 1987). Flour from black leaves of bergeniais used for cookies (Bugdaeva et al., 2005). Roots of sweet flagwere used as source of starch (Berson, 1991). Whole or crushedcaraway seeds, dried and ground into flour fruits of hawthorn,bird cherry, rowan, guelder rose were added to the pastry whenbaking bread and sweet bakery (cakes and pancakes) (Gubanovet al., 1976; Koscheev, 1981; Tcherepnin, 1987; Budantsev andLesiovskaya, 2001).In the middle of nineteenth century, fruits of guelder rose(Viburnum opulus) were popular in Tver province of Russia asingredients for making "kulaga," a porridge based on malt flour.Guelder rose fruits tenderized with flour and honey were "a tastycuisine and refined taste for urban residents, not excluding thenobility" (Toren, 1996). Residents of Pskov province received thenickname "kalinniki" because they cooked a delicious porridgewith guelder rose ("kalina" in Russian) berries and licorice flour,which was sold at the bazaar (Toren, 1996).Despite the fact that today wild bread additives have almostcompletely disappeared from the European diet (Luczaj et al.,2012), in Russia some local bakeries produce bread and buns withnettle, hawthorn, and dog rose.Species Used in PreservesHome made preserves have a long tradition in Russia because ofthe long and severe cold season. There are many canning recipesin every household for foods which have been handed down fromgeneration to generation. Plants used for preserves can be dividedinto two large groups. Fresh juicy berries of rose hips, guelderrose, rowan, bird cherry, and bilberry are widely used in jam,comfiture, and marmalade. All these berries are useful for fillingpies (Klobukova-Alisova, 1958; Baikov, 1968; Gubanov et al.,1976; Sokolov, 1985, 1990; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001;Soenov, 2002). The second group includes species used as spicesand condiments for pickling and salting of cabbage, cucumbers,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 841278Shikov et al. Food, Wild Plants, Russian Pharmacopoeiatomatoes and other vegetables, as well as mushrooms: caraway,juniper, and thyme (Rubtsov, 1971; Gubanov et al., 1976;Koscheev, 1981; Tcherepnin, 1987; Litvintsev and Koscheev,1988; Grisjuk et al., 1989; Soukand et al., 2013).CONCLUSIONSThis review focuses on botanical drugs with a monograph inthe Russian Pharmacopoeia 11th edition and their potentialas untapped resources beyond their strictly medical uses. Ingeneral, the Soviet period was characterized by the countrybeing closed not only from a political point of view, butalso scientifically. Most commonly, research output was onlyavailable in Russian and not translated into English dramaticallyrestricting its availability to the international community. Heresuch information published in Russian was evaluated focusingon medicinal species from the Russian (Soviet) Pharmacopoeiaand used as a food. This highlights the importance of the RussianPharmacopoeia as a source of information on plant species usedtraditionally at the interface of food and medicine.Clearly our approach has the limitation of only focusing onspecies included in the pharmacopeia and, consequently, localor endemic species are mostly excluded. However, in the contextof developing high value products with potential health benefitspriority needs to be given to species which are widely availableand not at risk of being overexploited if the demand increases.The evidence for the individual species varies, and while wedo not claim that their use could be, based on the current data,evidence-based, the review provides a basis for further researchand development. "Functional food" are foods that not only serve to providenutrition but also can be a source for prevention and cure ofvarious diseases. This review highlights the potential of wildRussian species monographed in its pharmacopeia for furtherdeveloping new functional foods and--through the lens of theirincorporation into the pharmacopeia--showcases the species'importance in Russia.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAS, AT, OP, and VMhave written the first draft of themanuscript.AS, OP, and MH revised and improved the various drafts andrevisions.
