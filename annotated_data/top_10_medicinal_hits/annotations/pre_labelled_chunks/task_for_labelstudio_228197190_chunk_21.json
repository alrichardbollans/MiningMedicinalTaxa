A range of tulsi samples were collected which were subjected to DNA analysis to determine their species. Samples were collected from research participants (community samples), as well as commercial samples, and authenticated species for the identification process. This research involved a multi-disciplinary approach by combining social science research methods with molecular techniques. 4.2 Aim of the Tulsi Project The aim is to investigate the cultural and commercial value of tulsi, Ocimum tenuiflorum, amongst diasporic South Asian communities in the UK; and to authenticate tulsi samples using DNA-based analytical techniques. 4.3 Objectives of the Tulsi Project 1. Explore the cultural and commercial values associated with tulsi, in South Asian communities in the UK. 2. Collect a range of tulsi products and perform DNA analyses in order to: classify species, identify genetic variations, and isolate adulterant species. 4.4 Background to the Research This section will give an insight into the origins, cultural values, medicinal uses, and botanical identity of tulsi; in order to establish the importance of this research. An explanation of the traditional and new research methods used for medicinal plant identification will highlight the potential applications of DNA barcoding. 4.4.1 Origins of Tulsi Tulsi is native to tropical Asia, it grows wild in warm regions. It has been used in South Asia, China, the Middle East, Africa and Australia for centuries (Maimes, 2004). With the migration of people, the plant has become available around the world, and varieties are even grown in the UK. As the tulsi plant travelled West, it became known to Christians as \"holy\" basil as is reflected in its Latin binomial, O. sanctum L. (now referred to as O. tenuiflorum L.). The scared plant was given as a gift in the annual celebration of the birth of St. Basil, as people gave it the status as a 'gift from Christ' (Miller and Miller, 2003). 141 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Tulsi is used in various traditional medical systems including: Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. Ayurvedic scriptures refer to tulsi as one of the main pillars of herbal medicine, first mentioned in the Rig Veda around 1500 BC. It is widely incorporated in traditional Indian cuisine, cosmetics, herbal remedies and religious ceremonies (poojas). The whole plant can be used, seeds, roots, leaves, flowers and even the stem (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). The woody stem is often used to make tulsi beads, worn as necklaces or bracelets believed to provide physical protection, and even made into rosaries for spiritual protection (Miller and Miller, 2003). Daily use of tulsi is believed to help maintain balance of the chakras, energy centres of the body (Winston and Maimes, 2007). Tulsi is one of the most sacred plants on the Indian subcontinent, as it represents a Hindu goddess, Virinda Tulsi. Legend has it that Virinda was married to a demon called Jalandhar who was destroying the world. Due to Virinda's purity and devotion to God her evil husband was immortal. The only way to kill Jalandhar was if his wife's purity was tarnished. Lord Krishna disguised himself as Virinda's husband and tainted Virinda's purity; which led to the death of Jalandhar. Virinda felt she had been betrayed by the Gods and threw herself onto her husband's burning pyre, to relieve herself from the shame of cheating on her husband. From this it is said her soul was transformed into the tulsi plant and Lord Krishna vowed to marry her to take away the shame. Hence, every year the wedding anniversary, Tulsi Vivah, is celebrated by Hindus around the world (Figure 4-1). It is Virinda Tulsi's purity and devotion to God which makes Hindus believe the plant is so pure and sacred; thus the plant is incorporated in religious ceremonies, used as religious offerings (Prasad), and added to the burning pyre of the deceased where it is believed to aid the passage to heaven (Shatri Ramnik Dev, 2013). Tulsi plants are supposedly kept in every Hindu temple and most households where it is thought to be a blessing if the plant grows (Wagner, 2010).

Tulsi is considered one of the most powerful herbs as it is used for treating a vast array of medical disorders; including conditions which affect the skin, the cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, and central nervous system (Winston and Maimes, 2007). Traditionally tulsi has been used to treat asthma, bronchitis, diabetes, diarrhoea, eye disorders (chronic conjunctivitis, cataracts, and glaucoma), fever, insect bites, snake bites, malaria, and a variety of skin diseases. Tulsi is also known to have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antidiabetic, anticancer, antifertility, anti-inflammatory, adaptogenic, analgesic, cardioprotective, and hepatoprotective properties (Prakash and Gupta, 2005; Philip and Unni, 2011; Singh et al., 2012). Different parts of the tulsi plant including the seeds, roots, stems, and leaves are known to possess therapeutic properties and are used to formulate herbal remedies (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). There are various ways to consume tulsi in order to reap the medicinal benefits. Fresh or dried tulsi leaves can be eaten, used in cooking, infused in tea, hot water, or bath water. A variety of commercial tulsi products are also available including: capsules, creams, juices, oils, shampoos, soaps, tablets, teas, and tonics. Human and animal studies have suggested tulsi can be useful for diabetes as it has been found to alter glucose regulation via several pathways (Chattopadhyay, 1993; Vats et al., 2002; Prakash and Gupta, 2005). Agrawal et al. (1996) administered 2.5g of tulsi leaves to type 2 diabetic patients for sixty days and observed a decrease in fasting and post-prandial blood glucose. Tulsi has been shown to reduce blood glucose levels, and increase glycogen stores and insulin levels in the body (Joshi et al., 2012). Traditionally tulsi is believed to have been used as a contraceptive and to improve libido. The literature available on the antifertility and abortive effects of tulsi are dated (Khanna et al., 1986), but precaution in pregnant women are still taken (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). Studies in female rats found a reduction in implantation, full term pregnancies and a reduced litter size after the administration of tulsi (Vohra et al., 1969; Khanna et al., 1986). Animal studies suggest tulsi can temporarily reduce sperm count and sperm motility (Ahmed et al., 2002), and increase libido (Pande and Pathak, 2009). Hence, in India tulsi has traditionally been used as a male contraceptive (Sethi et al., 2010). Research even documents the powerful antibacterial effects of tulsi in treating the sexually transmitted disease, gonorrhoea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea which is sensitive to extracts of O. tenuiflorum; Shokeen et al. (2005) refer to it as being as good as penicillin and ciprofloxacin. 143 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 4.4.3 Active Compounds in Tulsi The chemical composition of tulsi is complex and can vary between different cultivars (Rahman et al., 2011). The quantities of chemicals found in plants can be affected by the growing conditions, stage of harvesting (young or mature plant), processing and manufacturing stages, and storage conditions (Pattanayak et al., 2010). Tulsi plants contain a variety of saponins, flavonoids, triterpenoids, tannins and essentials oils; including, eugenol, methyl eugenol, eugenic acid, urosolic acid, carvacrol, linalool, limatrol, caryophyllene, and methy chavicol (Pattanayak et al., 2010; Rahman et al., 2011). Tulsi leaves contain the phenolic compounds eugenol and methyl eugenol which form part of the plants' essential oil content. Eugenol is responsible for the spicy aromatic fragrance produced by the plant, as well as some of the associated health benefits. Eugenol has antiseptic, anaesthetic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant effects. Quantitative variations have been seen in the composition of essential oils in tulsi plants grown in different parts of India, different seasons of harvesting and growing conditions (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). 4.4.4 Precautions with Tulsi Traditionally tulsi is avoided in pregnant women as it has been known to cause miscarriage and was used to induce abortion. Ursolic acid, one of the major constituents found in the leaves, is believed to have antifertility effects (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). Batta and Santhakumari (1970) demonstrated the antifertility affects in mice by administering a dose of 200mg/kg of tulsi in a benzene vehicle to pregnant mice. Animal studies have shown the antifertility effects but the results remain dated and inconclusive (Gardner and McGuffin, 2013). Tulsi was traditionally considered to be a male contraceptive (Sethi et al., 2010) and has been associated with reducing sperm count and motility (Khanan et al., 1986; Ahmed et al., 2002); therefore, it should be avoided if trying to conceive. Some herbal remedies require fresh tulsi leaves to be chewed in order to obtain the medicinal effects. The plant contains natural mercury, which may be harmful to the teeth if the leaves are chewed and in prolonged contact with the mouth (Joshi et al., 2012). This can be avoided by swallowing the leaves whole with water or drinking infusions. If the plant is grown in areas where there are high levels of chromium contaminating the soil (i.e. from industrial leaks, fertilisers, and pesticides) it can have severe consequences as chromium can damage the liver and kidneys (Rai et al., 2004). 144 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Singh et al. (2001) revealed the fixed oil of tulsi at a dose of 3ml/kg prolonged blood clotting time; they claimed the effect was because the oil prevented platelet aggregation. The blood thinning properties of tulsi have been compared to that of aspirin; therefore, people taking anti-platelets (e.g. aspirin and clopidogrel) and anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) should consume tulsi with great caution (Singh et al., 2001). Winston and Maimes (2007) highlight that tulsi enhances cytochrome CYP450 enzyme activity. This can increase elimination of drugs rendering them less useful or ineffective. However, the American Herbal Products Association released an updated botanical safety handbook in 2013 which stated there were no drug interactions or adverse effects identified for tulsi (Gardner and McGuffin, 2013). 4.4.5 Botanical Identity of Tulsi Typical characteristics of the Lamiaceae family include a square stem, opposite and decussate leaves, with numerous oil glands which secrete aromatic oils giving the plants distinct odours (Paton et al., 2005; Schmiderer et al., 2008). Part of the Lamiaceae family is the Ocimum genus, which has around thirty species (Paton, 1992). Alongside the traditional culinary basil (O. bascilium L.), tulsi (O. tenuiflorum L.) is the Indian alternative, commonly referred to as Holy basil; as reflected in its former Latin binomial O. sanctum L. which translates to sacred or the incomparable one. The word basil is likely to have originated from the Greek word Basileus which means kingly or royal. Some may refer to tulsi as the 'King of Herbs' however due to the Hindu association of the plant with the goddess Virinda Tulsi others call it the 'Queen of herbs' (Miller and Miller, 2003). Tulsi can be described as a highly branched herb or shrub which can grow up to a meter tall, from the tiny round, dark brown, odourless but pungent tasting seed (Joshi et al., 2012). The bright green to dark purple, aromatic leaves are classically arranged in an opposite formation, with an oval-oblong shape similar to that of mint leaves. The square stem is hairy, purple to brown coloured, and woody in appearance; while the flowers can range in colour from white, yellow, and purple (WHO, 2002b). There are a variety of different types of tulsi available (Figure 4-2). According to Ayurvedic scriptures the most common types being Raam tulsi, and Shyam also referred to as Krishna tulsi. Botanists classify these two types as O. tenuiflorum; and the less common type is Vana Kingdom: Plantae Division: Magnoliophyta Class: Magnoliopsida Order: Lamiales Family: Lamiaceae Genus: Ocimum Species: O. tenuiflorum Botanical name: O. tenuiflorum Synonyms: O. sanctum (Hiran, 2009) 145 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra tulsi (O. gratissimum) which is commonly known as African basil (Joshi et al., 2012). Although the plants are characteristically different, they may all be referred to and kept as tulsi (Maimes, 2004). Microscopic Characteristics of Tulsi WHO (2002) describes tulsi leaves as having a layer of small, quadrangular cells on the lower epidermis, trichomes of 2-6 cells, including short glandular trichomes, and diacytic stomata located on both the upper and lower epidermis. Similar studies by Datta et al. (2012) and Joshi et al. (2012) also recorded several important characteristics of tulsi including: oil globules, multicellular and unicellular simple and glandular trichomes (Figure 4-3). Figure 4-2 Raam, Shyam, and Vana Tulsi Grown In Bangalore, India Figure 4-3 Image of the Lower Epidermis of a Tulsi Leaf at 500x Magnification under a Scanning Electron Microscope Trichome Oil gland Stomata Taken at De Montfort University by R. Armitage and S. Bhamra. 146 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The image (Figure 4-3) reveals a high concentration of trichomes on the lower surface of the tulsi leaf. Trichomes often have several functions including: producing and storing essential oils and chemicals which may be used to supplement the defence mechanism of the plant, and offering protection to the leaf from insects and larvae (Levin, 1973). The structure, function, and density of trichomes can be used for taxonomic purposes. Numerous oil glands can also be seen in Figure 4-3. The Lamiaceae family has several species which are highly aromatic; most of the species produce and store essential oils in specialised epidermal oil glands (Schmiderer et al., 2008). The oils produced are distinctive of the species and can be used to identify the plants. The oils are composed of a mixture of compounds, which have many health benefits. The essential oils produced by tulsi contain the active compound eugenol, which has antiseptic and anaesthetic properties (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). The scent of the oil deters insects and has been used as a mosquito repellent (Joshi et al., 2012). 147 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 4.4.6 Methods of Plant Identification The European Pharmacopoeia is a standard reference for the quality control of medicines (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare, 2015); it has defined morphological and chemical profiles for medicinal plant species. Unlike traditional methods of plant authentication (i.e. morphology and chemical analysis) (Chen et al., 2014); DNA barcoding is a relatively new technique for plant identification, the applications of which are still being explored. Morphology A dichotomous key is used to sequentially identify parts of the plant to categorise the plants family, genus, and species (Jacono, 2009). Morphology encompasses the use of highly trained individuals who can identify the plants superficial structures to classify them; it includes the macroscopic and microscopic features. The macroscopic features are the physical characteristics of the plant such as the colour, size, structure, shape, taste, and aroma of the plant (Joshi et al., 2004). The microscopic structures of the plant can be seen using powerful microscopes and techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The morphological features can be affected by the age of the plant, stage of harvesting, processing, and storage of the plants (Joshi et al., 2004). A clear example of how age can affect the microscopic features can be seen in Figure 4-4; the younger tulsi leaf has more trichomes which may help protect the leaf during development, in comparison to the mature leaf which has less trichomes. SEM is a technique which can be used for examining plant surfaces at high resolution and to determine plant species. Electrons from a beam interact with atoms on the surface of the sample, producing an image of the surface composition. Previously, plant tissues needed to be preserved by dehydration for observation in an electron microscope otherwise the sample would be distorted under the high vacuum. Often samples had to be coated with conductive Figure 4-4 Image of Young and Mature O. tenuiflorum Leaf under a Scanning Electron Microscope Taken at De Montfort University by R. Armitage and S.
