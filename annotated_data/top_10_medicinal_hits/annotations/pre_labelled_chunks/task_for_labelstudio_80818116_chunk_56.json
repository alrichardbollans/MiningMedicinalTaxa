The inter-pretation of the measured 6-TGN and 6-MMP levels, re-spectively is following - subtherapeutic (< 235 pmol/8*108 erythrocytes), therapeutic (235-400 pmol/8*108 erythro-cytes) and high levels correlated to myelotoxicity (> 400 pmol/8*108 erythrocytes); below 5700 pmol/8*108 eryth-rocytes and more than 5700 pmol/8*108 erythrocytes - associated with hepatotoxicity (Vikingsson et al., 2013). Measured metabolite levels correlated to the clinical re-sponse from azathioprine therapy.Conclusion A simple, sensitive, precise and accurate HPLC meth-od has been developed and validated for simultaneous de-termination of 6-TGN and 6-MMP in erythrocytes. Its main pros are: chromatographic run time less than 10 minutes (3.67 minutes for 6-TGN and 7.60 minutes for 6-MMP), facilitated pre-analytical procedure, rapid and specific de-termination of 6-MMP and 6-TGN intra-erythrocyte con-centrations. The proposed method was successfully applied to erythrocytes samples obtained from 33 patients with in-flammatory bowel disease under azathioprine therapy. The method results are in agreement with those obtained with other available methods, demonstrating its applicability for monitoring the azathioprine treatment.ReferencesDervieux, T., Boulieu, R., 1998.

These compounds include the eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, prostacyclin, leu-kotrienes, and thromboxane and the modified phospholip-ids such as platelet activating factor (PAF). Eicosanoids are synthesized from 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty arachi-donic acid, found in many cells, including activated leu-kocytes, mast cells, and platelets and therefore are widely distributed. Many inflammatory mediators (TNF-a, brady-kinin) stimulate eicosanoid production either by direct ac-tivation of PLA2, or indirectly by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, which in turn activate the enzyme. Ar-achidonic acid can be converted to these products by three different pathways: cyclooxygenase, leading to the forma-tion of prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes), li-pooxygenase, where leukotrienes and certain mono-, di- and tri-hydroxy acids are synthesized, and epoxygenase pathway, which includes cytochrome P-450 and epoxides as final products. Accordingly, cyclooxygenases, lipooxy-genases and epoxygenases are enzymes involved in these pathways (Smith, 1989). Cyclooxygenase (COX), impli-cated in cyclooxygenase pathway, exists in two forms, named COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitu-tively in different tissues, blood monocytes and platelets, and transforms arachidonic acid to prostanoids, which are involved in normal cellular homeostasis. In contrast, COX-2 may be induced by a series of pro-inflammatory stimuli and its role in the progress of inflammation, fever and pain has been known (Hawkey, 1999). Furthermore, three types of lipoxygenases, termed 5-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase are engaged in lipoxygenase pathway. Some compounds, like 12(S)-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), a product of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), has influence on the regulation of platelet aggregation, but is also found to be involved in the progression of several hu-man diseases like various cancers (Nie and Honn, 2002) psoriasis (Muller, 1994) and rheumatoid arthritis (Liagre et al., 1997). Aforementioned enzymes can be found in dif-ferent cell types. Thus, in human platelets, COX-1 and 12-LOX are the initial enzymes responsible for arachidonic acid metabolism leading to the formation of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 12-HHT (12(S)-hy-droxy-(5Z,8E,10E)-heptadecatrienoic acid) and 12-HETE. In vitro technique for evaluation of anti-inflamatory activities of natural products and plants extractsSince our research is focused on biological activity of plant extracts, we aimed to evaluate and optimize an in vi-tro assay for anti-inflammatory activity, that can be easi-ly used to determine COX-1 and 12-LOX inhibitory po-tential of plant extracts or natural products, using LC-MS/MS technique for quantification of metabolites and human platelets as a source of enzymes. We used human platelets as the cell system for testing anti-inflammatory activity of numerous plant extracts and secondary metabolites. Inflammation is induced by cal-cymicin (calcium ionophore A23187) with subsequent ad-dition of Ca2+. Detailed procedure is described in our previ-ous report (Beara et al., 2010; Lesjak et al., 2013). Consid-ering quantification of formed products, our research was focused on LC-MS/MS technique in order to attain high sensitive and specific method with short analysis time. Furthermore, tandem mass spectrometry provides far bet-ter sensitivity and selectivity than traditional UV detectors S3 OP 114248Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 247 - 248 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationsand does not depend on presence of chromophores. The method is optimized in order to get best performance for detection of PGE2, TXB2, 12-HHT (COX-1 pathway) and 12-HETE (12-LOX pathway) products, using PGB2 as in-ternal standard. The method performances were confirmed by measuring several parameters (Beara et al., 2010). The advantage and efficiency of this method was fur-ther confirmed through numerous subsequent studies on biological activity of natural plant products (Beara et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2014; Lesjak et al., 2011; Lesjak et al., 2013; Nadjpal et al., 2016, Simin et al., 2013). Further-more this method provides valuable information about the metabolism of arachidonic acid under inflammation. And finally, it should be noted that one of the important advan-tage of applied experiment is avoidance of undesirable in vivo tests on experimental animals.

All environmental media have naturally occur-ring mixtures of metals, and metals often are introduced into the environment as mixtures. Some of them are es-sential for maintaining proper health of humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms.Metals and inorganic requiring different approach-es for Environmental Hazard and Exposure assessments, compared to \"typical organic contaminants\". Several prop-erties and aspects of metals - their natural occurrence, es-sentiality, bioavailability, homeostatic control mechanisms and acclimatization to diverse natural environments, - re-quire specific recognition in the context of an environmen-tal risk assessment. The basic concept of ENV-Hazard and Risk Assessment of metals consist of four stages:- Classification & ranking (acute/ chronic aquatic tox-icity, transformation /dissolution, particle sizes, rank-ing systems, etc...);- Effects assessment (soil, sediment, water, data selec-tion, data handling, effects analysis, uncertainty man-agement, etc... sec. Poisoning...);- Exposure assessment (data selection, data handling, local scenario, regional scenario, waste scenario, etc... ) and- Risk characterization (soil sediment water sec. Poi-soning, local scenario, regional scenario, waste sce-nario, etc...) (USEPA, 2007).This paper will be short introduction to challenges and key concepts specific to metals environmental assessment, through specific parts on bioavailability, effects assess-ment, and bioaccumulation.BioavailabilityBioavailability should be taken into account for hazard and risk assessment of metal compounds in order to focus on interspecies sensitivity. A tired approach can be used, ensuring that first tier assessments use effects data where bioavailability is maximized (MERAG, 2007). Knowl-edge of the chemistry of a compound will normally guide the need for the development of bioavailability correction models. Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) can be used to esti-mate bioavailability, taking into account competition from other ions and binding of metals with natural organic mat-ter. Many countries have developed frameworks for tak-ing into account metal specificities in environmental risk assessment.Bioavailability models have a specific applicability domain and have to cover soil/water parameters and back-ground relevant for the region where they are applied; in addition it may be needed to do checks with species spe-cific for that region. Further research is recommended to investigate to which extent commonalities between Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for species from different trophic levels apply amongst different metals. Further discussion is needed for developing a decision scheme as to the con-ditions for implementing BLMs in risk assessment.Effects assessmentHazard identification of metals and metal compounds is related to the toxicity of the soluble metal ions. The tox-icity of the metal ions and the release of these ions from the metal-containing substances are therefore used as a ba-sis for read-across.Effects assessments of metals could follow the follow-ing strategy: Data compilation & read-across- Data screening for relevancy and quality- Database developmentS3 OP 115250Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 249 - 250 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentations- Data normalization (i.e. Bioavailability correction) Data aggregation- Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) construction and HCX derivation if relevant PNEC derivation (in-cluding uncertainty assessment).- Metal-specific criteria for quality and relevancy of ef-fects data to be used in the assessment should be de-veloped, taking into account criteria already developed for chemicals effect data in general (MERAG,2007).Bioaccumulation and bioconcentrationFor some metals, background can be significant (rela-tive to the PEC or PNEC) and should be integrated in the risk assessment. At the level of PEC/PNEC: the total bio-availability approach and the added risk approach could be considered; Background should be measured in unpollut-ed environments.Available data for BCFs and other Accumulation Fac-tors for metals indicate that they are inversely related to water (and sediment, and soil) concentrations. Therefore the use of a single value for assessing risks from secondary poisoning has to be considered.Measures of tissue concentrations along the food chain provide a useful way to assess secondary poisoning.Further discussion is needed as to how to improve comparisons/interpretations of BCFs and BAFs for metals to regulatory threshold values.For the assessment of secondary poisoning, a tiered approach should be used, taking into account: dietary com-position for consumer organisms, high BCF values could be used as a trigger to perform more detailed assessments, relevant food chains should drive the selection of BAFs and oral PNEC values, bioavailability of the metal in the food or incidentally ingested soil/sediment and the water concentration used in BCF or BAF experiments should preferably be in the same range as the PEC.ConclusionPresented key guiding principles is based on the unique attributes of metals. Metal speciation affects met-al behavior in environmental media. PH and redox poten-tial affect speciation. Kd values - a coefficient for mobili-ty in soils limited use of single values. Aging of metals in media reduces bioavailability."
