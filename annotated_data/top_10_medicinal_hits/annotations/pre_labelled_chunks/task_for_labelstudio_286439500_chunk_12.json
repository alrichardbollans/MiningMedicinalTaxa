Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and BioactivitiesANALYTICAL TECHNIQUESAfter extraction and purification, the separation andquantification of berberine are commonly resolved bychromatographic methods. According to literature studies,berberine determination in plants was predominantly performedusing methods like UV spectrophotometry (Joshi and Kanaki,2013), HPLC (Babu et al., 2012; Akowuah et al., 2014), HPTLCand TLC (Rojsanga and Gritsanapan, 2005; Arawwawala andWickramaar, 2012; Samal, 2013), capillary electrophoresis (Duand Wang, 2010), while berberine content in biological fluidswas mainly achieved by using LC-MS (Deng et al., 2008; Fenget al., 2010), UPLC-MS (Liu M. et al., 2015; Liu L. et al., 2016),UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS (Wu et al., 2015).UV-Vis spectrophotometry can be considered as one of themost rapid detection methods for berberine quantitative analysisfrom plant extracts. Based on the Beer-Lambert law, berberineconcentration can be determined according to its absorptionmaxima at 348 nm. Joshi and Kanaki (2013) quantified berberinein Rasayana churna samples in the range of 2-20 ug/mL, theinterference with other compounds being avoided by the specificisolation of the alkaloid fraction (Joshi and Kanaki, 2013).Next, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is aversatile, robust, and widely used technique for the qualitativeand quantitative analysis of natural products (Sasidharan et al.,2011). This approach is widely used in berberine identificationand quantification. Generally, the choices of stationary phasein berberine separation are variants of C18-based silica column(Table 3) with a mobile phase consisting of simple or acidifiedsolvents like water, methanol, or acetonitrile, used as suchor in combination with phosphate buffers. Normally, theidentification and separation of berberine can be accomplishedusing either isocratic or gradient elution system. Berberineidentification is further accomplished using high sensitivity UVor DAD (diode array detectors) detectors. For example, Shigwanet al. (2013) developed in his study a reverse phase HPLCmethod with photodiode array detection (PDA) to quantifyberberine from Berberis aristata and B. tinctoria. They useda Unisphere-C18 column (5um, 4.6 x 150mm) with anisocratic gradient of acidified water (with 0.1% trifluoroaceticacid) and acetonitrile (60:40, v/v) to elute berberine within5min. The developed method was reproducible, validated,precise, and specific for berberine quantification (with aconcentration range between 0.2 and 150ug/mL; Shigwan et al.,2013).Two other commonly used techniques in berberinequantification are thin layer chromatography (TLC) andhigh performance thin layer chromatography (HTPLC).Sometimes, these methods are preferred over HPLC, offeringthe possibility of running several samples simultaneously alongwith the use of small amount of both samples and mobile phases(Samal, 2013). For these reasons, Samal (2013) used an HPTLCmethod to quantify berberine from A. mexicana L. using tolueneand ethyl acetate (9:3, v/v) as mobile phases, and a silica gelplate as stationary phase, they developed a simple, rapid, andcost-effective method for berberine quantification. The LOD(0.120 ug) and LOQ (0.362 ug) of the method are in accordancewith high-quality requirements.Following the same principles (small sample volume,high separation efficiency, and short analysis time), capillaryelectrophoresis (CE) was successfully used in berberineanalysis. Du and Wang (2010) used CE with end-columnelectrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection for berberineanalysis in both tablets and Rhizoma coptidis. Using a 4minanalysis time, a small sample volume (3.3 nL) and a LOD of (5x10-9 g/mL), the developed method proved to be highly sensitiveand with good resolution (Du and Wang, 2010).Besides UV, HPLC, HTPLC, TLC, and CE, other detectionmethods like liquid chromatography coupled with massspectrometry (LC/MS) are currently employed to quantifyberberine in biological fluids. Generally, it is considered apowerful technique for the analysis of complex samples becauseit offers rapid and accurate information about the structuralcomposition of the compounds, especially when tandem massspectrometry (MSn) is applied. For example, Xu et al. (2015)developed a sensitive an accurate LC-MS/MS method todetermine berberine and other seven components in rat plasmausing multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode. Compoundsseparation was optimized using six different types of reverse-phase columns, and two different mobile phases (methanol-water and acetonitrile-water with different additives). Additiveslike formic acid, acetic acid, and ammonium acetate were addedin different concentrations as follows: 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2% forformic acid, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2% for acetic acid and 0.0001, 0.001,0.01 mol/L for ammonium acetate. The method was also testedin terms of specificity, linearity, lower limit of quantification(LLOQ), precision, accuracy, and stability (Xu et al., 2015).ANTIOXIDANT EFFECTUnder normal conditions, the body maintains a balancebetween the antioxidant and pro-oxidant agents (reactive oxygenspecies--ROS and reactive nitrogen species--RNS; Rahal et al.,2014).The imbalance between pro and antioxidants occurs in case ofincreased oxidative stress (Bhattacharyya et al., 2014).The oxidative stress builds up through several mechanisms: anincrease in the production of reactive species, a decrease in thelevels of enzymes involved in blocking the actions of pro-oxidantcompounds, and/or the decrease in free radical scavengers (Pilchet al., 2014).An experimental study demonstrated the effect of berberineon lipid peroxidation after inducing chemical carcinogenesis insmall animals (rats). An increase in LPO (lipid peroxidation) wasobserved after carcinogenesis induction, but also its significantreversal after berberine administration (30 mg/kg). Berberineshows therefore at least partial antioxidant properties, due to itseffect on lipid peroxidation (Thirupurasundari et al., 2009).Other mechanisms involved in the antioxidant role ofberberine are: ROS/RNS scavenging, binding of metals leadingto the transformation/oxidation of certain substances, free-oxygen removal, reducing the destructiveness of superoxide ionsand nitric oxide, or increasing the antioxidant effect of someendogenous substances. The antioxidant effect of berberine wascomparable with that of vitamin C, a highly-potent antioxidant(Shirwaikar et al., 2006; Ahmed et al., 2015).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55741Neag et al. Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and BioactivitiesThe increase in blood sugar leads to oxidative stress notby generating oxygen reactive species but by impairing theantioxidant mechanisms. Administration of berberine to ratswith diabetes mellitus increased the SOD (superoxide dismutase)activity and decreased theMDA (malondialdehyde) level (markerof lipid peroxidation). This antioxidant effect of berberine couldexplain the renal function improvement in diabetic nephropathy(Liu et al., 2008b).The oxidative stress plays an important role in thepathogenesis of many diseases. The beneficial effect of berberineis presumed to reside mostly in its antioxidant role.CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OFBERBERINEEffect on Cardiac ContractilityThe beneficial effect of berberine in cardiac failure wasdemonstrated in a study on 51 patients diagnosed with NYHA(New York Heart Association) III/IV cardiac failure with low leftventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and premature ventricularcontractions and/or ventricular tachycardia. These patientsreceived tablets containing 1.2 g berberine/day, together withconventional therapy (diuretics, ACEI--angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, nitrates) for 2 weeks. An increasein LVEF was observed in all patients after this period, butalso a decrease in the frequency and complexity of prematureventricular contractions. The magnitude of the beneficial effectwas in direct proportion with the plasma concentration ofberberine (Zeng, 1999).The Cardioprotective Effect DuringIschemiaBerberine can provide cardio-protection in ischemic conditionsby playing various roles at different levels: modulation ofAMPK (AMP--activated kinase) activity, AKT (proteinkinase B) phosphorylation, modulation of the JAK/STAT(Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription)pathway and of GSK3b (glycogen synthase kinase 3b; Changet al., 2016). AMPK is an important enzyme playing an essentialrole in cellular metabolism and offering protection in ischemicconditions by adjusting the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism,the function of cell organelles (mitochondria, endoplasmicreticulum) and the apoptosis (Zaha et al., 2016).Berberine activates the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT pathway which is considered a compensatorymechanism limiting the pro-inflammatory processes andapoptotic events in the presence of aggressive factors. Theactivation of this pathway is associated with a reduction of theischemic injury through the modulation of the TLR4 (toll-likereceptor 4)-mediated signal transduction (Hua et al., 2007).Several supporting data indicate that the JAK2/STAT3signaling plays an important role in cardioprotection againstischemia-reperfusion injury (Mascareno et al., 2001).GSK3b is a serine/threonine protein-kinase, an enzymeinvolved in reactions associated to important processes at thecellular level: metabolization, differentiation, proliferation, andapoptosis. Berberine inhibits this kinase, thereby exercising itscardioprotective effect (Park et al., 2014).EFFECTS ON THE ENDOTHELIUMBerberine induces endothelial relaxation by increasing NOproduction from arginine through the activity of eNOS(endothelial nitric oxide synthase) which is considered a keyelement in the vasodilation process. Besides increasing the NOlevel, it also up-regulates eNOS mRNA. Furthermore, berberinefacilitates the phosphorylation of eNOS and its coupling toHSP 90 (heat shock proteins), which consequently increases NOproduction (Wang et al., 2009).Moreover, berberine reduces endothelial contractionby reducing COX-2 expression. Any imbalance inCOX 1 or 2 activity may alter the ratio betweenprothrombotic/antithrombotic and vasodilator/vasoconstrictoreffects (Liu L. et al., 2015).The beneficial effect of berberine on the TNFa-inducedendothelial contraction was also recorded, as well as an increasein the level of PI3K/AKT/eNOS mRNA (Xiao et al., 2014).THE ROLE OF BERBERINE INATHEROSCLEROSISAtherogenesis is a consequence of high blood lipid levels andis associated with inflammatory changes in the vascular wall.Berberine interferes with this process by up-regulating theexpression of SIRT1 (silent information regulator T1) and byinhibiting the expression of PPARg (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g). SIRT1 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase.The SIRT1 enzyme has many targets (PPARg , p53), all playingdifferent roles in atherogenesis (Chi et al., 2014).The Role of Berberine in Lipid MetabolismThe effects of berberine on lipid metabolism are also theconsequence of its effects on LDL cholesterol receptors. On onehand, these receptors are stabilized by an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway, and on the other,berberine increases the activity of LDL receptors through the JNKpathway (Cicero and Ertek, 2009).Moreover, berberine has an effect on ACAT (cholesterolacyltransferases), a class of enzymes that transform cholesterolinto esters, thus playing an essential role in maintainingcholesterol homeostasis in different tissues. There are two typesof ACAT enzymes, ACAT1, and ACAT2. ACAT1 is a ubiquitousenzyme, while ACAT2 can be found only in hepatic cells andenterocytes. Berberine influences the activity of ACAT2 withoutan effect on ACAT1, therefore reducing the intestinal absorptionof cholesterol and decreasing its plasmatic level (Chang et al.,2009; Wang et al., 2014).The hypolipidemic effect of berberine is also a result of itsaction on PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9). Thisenzyme can attach itself to LDL receptors, leading to a decrease inLDL metabolization and an increase in its blood level (Xiao et al.,2012).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55742Neag et al. Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and BioactivitiesIn a clinical trial, 63 patients with dyslipidemia were randomlydivided in three groups. The first group was treated withberberine (1,000 mg/day), the second with simvastatin (20mg/day) and the third with a combination of berberine andsimvastatin. The authors reported a 23.8% reduction in LDL-Clevels in patients treated with berberine, a 14.3% reduction inthose treated with simvastatin and a 31.8% LDL-C reduction inthe group treated with both simvastatin and berberine. This resultdemonstrates that berberine can be used alone or in associationwith simvastatin in the treatment of dyslipidemia (Kong et al.,2008).THE ROLE OF BERBERINE IN GLUCOSEMETABOLISMMany studies demonstrated that berberine lowers blood sugar,through the following mechanisms:- Inhibition of mitochondrial glucose oxidation andstimulation of glycolysis, and subsequently increasedglucose metabolization (Yin et al., 2008a).- Decreased ATP level through the inhibition of mitochondrialfunction in the liver, which may be the probable explanationof gluconeogenesis inhibition by berberine (Xia et al., 2011).- Inhibition of DPP 4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), a ubiquitousserine protease responsible for cleaving certain peptides, suchas the incretins GLP1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP(gastric inhibitory polypeptide); their role is to raise theinsulin level in the context of hyperglycemia. The DPP4inhibition will prolong the duration of action for thesepeptides, therefore improving overall glucose tolerance (Al-masri et al., 2009; Seino et al., 2010).Berberine has a beneficial effect in improving insulin resistanceand glucose utilization in tissues by lowering the lipid(especially triglyceride) and plasma free fatty acids levels(Chen et al., 2011).The effect of berberine (1,500mg day) on glucose metabolismwas also demonstrated in a pilot study enrolling 84 patients withtype 2 diabetes mellitus. The effect, including on HbA1c, wascomparable to that of metformin (1,500 mg/day), one of the mostwidely used hypoglycemic drugs. In addition, berberine has afavorable influence on the lipid profile, unlike metformin, whichhas barely any effect (Yin et al., 2008b).HEPATOPROTECTIVE EFFECT OFBERBERINEThe hepatoprotective effect of berberine was demonstratedon lab animals (mice), in which hepatotoxicity was inducedby doxorubicin. Pretreatment with berberine significantlyreduced both functional hepatic tests and histological damage(inflammatory cellular infiltrate, hepatocyte necrosis; Zhao et al.,2012).The mechanism by which berberine reduces hepatotoxicitywas also studied on CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride)-inducedhepatotoxicity. Berberine lowers the oxidative and nitrosaminestress and also modulates the inflammatory response in theliver, with favorable effects on the changes occurring in theliver. Berberine prevents the decrease in SOD activity andthe increase in lipid peroxidation and contributes to thereduction in TNF-a, COX-2, and iNOS (inducible nitric oxidesynthase) levels. The decrease in transaminase levels supportsthe hypothesis according to which berberine helps maintain theintegrity of the hepatocellular membrane (Domitrovic' et al.,2011).NEPHROPROTECTIVE EFFECT OFBERBERINEThe chronic kidney damage occurring in time in patients withHT (hypertension) and DM (diabetes mellitus) is well known; itis mainly due to the atherosclerosis of the renal artery, causedby inflammation and oxidative stress. The protective effect ofberberine on kidneys was studied on 69 patients suffering fromboth HT and DM, with blood pressure and blood sugar levelscontrolled with conventional medication."
