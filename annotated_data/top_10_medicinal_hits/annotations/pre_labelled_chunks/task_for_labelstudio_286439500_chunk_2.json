Centaurea ragusina L. Isolates' BioactivityINTRODUCTIONThe genus Centaurea (Asteraceae) represents an attractivesource for bioactive secondary metabolites such as sesquiterpenelactones (STLs), flavonoids, lignans, and their glycosides(Khammar and Djeddi, 2012). A number of therapeutic effectsagainst microbial infections, gastrointestinal disorders, andurogenital ailments have been attributed to Centaurea species inCroatian folk medicine and worldwide (Pahlow, 1989; Ayad et al.,2012; Politeo et al., 2012).Our recent study on the phytochemical and bioactive profileof non-volatile constituents of Centaurea ragusina L., an endemicCroatian halophytic species (Radic' et al., 2013), indicated thestrong potential for obtaining bioactive compounds from the leafethanol extract (CRE) (VujcVic' et al., 2017).In continuation of this previous study, the aim was toinvestigate the biological activity of all isolated compounds,namely the interaction with DNA, the antibacterial activityagainst Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii) (Lee et al., 2007;C'urkovic'-Perica et al., 2015) and anticancer activity against apanel of murine and human cancer cells.Due to its high biological significance, DNA is the primarytarget for many drugs with antibacterial and anticancer activity.Small organic molecules can bind to DNA by means of anon-specific, electrostatic binding along the DNA backbone, aspecific groove binding and intercalation or can form crosslinkswith DNA strands and induce cleavage of the DNA backbone(Demeunynck et al., 2002; Sangeetha Gowda et al., 2014).STLs are known to bind covalently to sulfhydryl groups ofenzymes and other functional proteins by Michael type additionof their electrophilic a, b-unsaturated carbonyl structures. It isbelieved that most of STL biological effects are due to theirreaction with biological nucleophiles such as GSH (Kupchanet al., 1971; Picman, 1986; Schmidt, 1999). Among many roles ofGSH in the cell, the most important one seems to be the removalof reactive species and elimination of xenobiotic compounds. Thelast one can be accomplished through conjugation with GSHfollowed by secretion of adducts from the cell (Boyland andChasseaud, 1969).Here, the aim was to study the activity of the most bioactivecompound in more detail, which included the interaction withDNA as the potential primary target and the interaction withGSH and its impact on cytotoxicity, cell cycle and cell death.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll safety precautions were taken when working with chemicalsreagents used in the experiments.General Experimental Procedures1D and 2D NMR experiments were performed on an Avance500 MHz instrument equipped with cryoprobe (Bruker,Billerica, MA, United States). The samples were measured inMeOD and DMSO-d6, respectively (calibrated to the residualnon-deuterated solvent signals). HR-ESI-MS analyses wereperformed on a maXis HD ESI-Qq-TOF mass spectrometer(Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The ESI ion source wasoperated as follows: capillary voltage: 2.0 to 4.5 kV (individuallyoptimized), nebulizer: 0.4 bar (N2), dry gas flow: 4 L min-1 (N2)and dry temperature: 200*C, scanning range, m/z 50-1550. Foreach isolated compound, fragment ion spectra of the [M+H]+,the [M+Na]+ and either the [M-H] - or the [M+HCOO]- ionwere recorded. The sum formulas of the ions were determinedusing Bruker Compass DataAnalysis 4.2 based on the massaccuracy (1m/z <= 2 ppm for MS1 and<= 3 ppm for MS/MS) andisotopic pattern matching (SmartFormula algorithm).Column chromatography (CC) was performed usingMerck silica gel 60 (40-63 um) and Pharmacia SephadexLH-20 (20-100 um). The fractions obtained from allchromatographic steps were analyzed by TLC (mobile phase:CH2Cl2-EtOAc (85:15), n-hexane-EtOAc-CH3COOH (6:3:1),or n-hexane-EtOAc (8:2); stationary phase: Merck silica gel60 PF254, detected with staining reagents vanillin/H2SO4 atvis, UV254, and UV366). HPLC was performed on a ShimadzuUFLC-XR instrument (Kyoto, Japan) with a photodiode arraydetector (DAD). LC-parameters: stationary phase: PhenomenexGemini-NX (C18), 150 mm x 3.00 mm, 5 um; temperature:35*C; mobile phase: water with 0.1% formic acid (A); acetonitrile(B); flow rate 0.4 mL/min; UV detection wavelength: 275 nm;injection volume: 10 uL; gradient: 80/20 A/B in 5 min to 70/30A/B, then within 20 min to 50/50 A/B and within another 2 minto 2/98, followed by a 5 min column wash (2A/98B) and are-equilibration period of 10 min. All chemicals and solventsused were of analytical grade.Plant MaterialCentaurea ragusina L. plants (in vegetative phase) were collectedin September, 2016, from two wild habitats - Katalinic' brig(43*30'03''N, 16*26'40''E, 363 m) and Sustipan (43*30'04''N,16*25'35''E, 754 m), Split, Croatia and identified by M. RuscVic',Department of Biology, University of Split, Croatia. A voucherspecimen (FSS-CR112016) is deposited at the above-mentioneddepartment.For extract preparation and isolation of pure compounds,lyophilized leaf materials from both locations were combinedafter confirmation of their comparable metabolite profile (VujcVic'et al., 2017).Extraction and IsolationThe dried ground leaves of C. ragusina L. (804.9 g) weremacerated with 7 L EtOH 96% (at 22*C for 7 days). For anexhaustive extraction the procedure was repeated three times.The dried extract (CRE, 108.9 g) was roughly fractionated bysilica gel CC (Merck silica gel 60 PF254, 510 g; 5.5 cm x 56 cm)using a step gradient of CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH (CH2Cl2;CH2Cl2-EtOAc 98:2; 95:5; 90:10; 85:15; 80:20; 75:25; 65:35; 60:40;55:45; 45:55; 35:65; 25:75; EtOAc; EtOAc-MeOH 80:20; 60:40;40:60; 20:80; MeOH) to give twelve fractions (A1-12).Fraction A6 (2.9 g) was further separated using silica gel CC(Merck silica gel 60 PF254, 213 g; 3 cmx 56 cm) applying again agradient system of CH2Cl2-EtOAc-MeOH to yield 25 fractions(B1-25).
