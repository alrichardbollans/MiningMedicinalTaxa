      "text": "Participants made references to the past when products such as gor (jaggery), black seed, and churan were ordered from abroad when family and friends went to visit, as they were only available in their native countries; but, now the products were readily available in the Asian shops in the UK. The two respondents who stated 'supermarket only' said this as they claimed they did not have Asian shops nearby, so relied on whatever was available in their local area. Finally, those who stated 'both Asian and chain supermarkets' commented on how ethnic ingredients were now available in Western chain supermarkets too; so went wherever was convenient. The large supermarkets are now catering for the needs of migrant communities by stocking ethnic ingredients (Retail Think Tank, 2013). As identified by the participants in this research, ingredients which were once only available from SA countries are now becoming more easily accessible from their local supermarkets; this could suggest a change in the way ingredients for traditional herbal remedies are sourced. Asian shops only Chain supermarkets only Both Asian and chainsupermarketsAsian or Western SupermarketsFigure 2-12 Where Ingredients for Herbal Remedies Were Bought From 40 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra During the research period a satellite project to investigate the availability of traditional SA HMs in Leicester was explored in collaboration with Professor Adrian Slater, Dr. Caroline Howard, Dr. Tamsyn Thring and Dr. Ketan Ruparelia. A variety of herbal products were collected from several supermarkets and SA shops around Leicester and Birmingham. The sample inventory comprised a range of products including raw ingredients (e.g. fresh karela, ginger and turmeric), seeds, powdered and dried products, as well as preformulated herbal remedies (e.g. turmeric capsules, tulsi tablets, and Chyawanprash). While collecting samples it became apparent that the products mentioned by the participants in this research were readily available. Based on work by Seethapathy et al. (2015) and Kumar et al. (2015) the research team explored the applications of DNA authentication on the herbal remedies collected. The study by Seethapathy et al. (2015) looked at authentication of medicinal plant laxatives Cassia L., Senna Mill., and Chamaecrista Moench. After collecting market samples of dried leaf, fruit, and bark material from shops across several locations in South India, they discovered the adulteration of species amongst the samples; leading them to raise concerns about the species of medicinal plants available in the Indian herbal market. Similar work by Kumar et al. (2015) also suggests there is a problem of species adulteration and substitution amongst the Indian herbal market. DNA authentication work on the herbal remedies collected in Birmingham and Leicester correctly revealed the species of the fresh samples collected. While other formulations collected such as tablets, capsules, dried turmeric root and neem leaves were not so easy to authenticate. Work to complete this study is still in progress. One of the observations highlighted was the lack of information about the ingredients of products on the labels of some of the commercial formulations brought. Some products had very little information about the ingredients while others had none at all. Furthermore, several products which had passed their sell by date and others which had their expiry dates changed by hand were bought. This raises concerns about the quality of herbal remedies available in the UK and suggests further research in required. 41 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 3: What form of herbal remedies do you use? Participants were given several options to select the types of herbal formulations they used (Figure 2-13). The most common types of herbal formulations used included: fresh herbs (e.g. mint, coriander, and fenugreek), dry powders (e.g. turmeric, cinnamon, black pepper, black salt, hing, and churan), and seeds (e.g. fennel, rye, mustard, black seed, and ajwain). Participants mentioned that as some ingredients were not readily available in the UK, they would import dried material from countries such as India and Pakistan; tulsi, turmeric and neem leaves were commonly mentioned as being imported to the UK. Liquid formulations used included: oils (e.g. olive, almond, coconut, sunflower, and mustard oil), syrups for coughs, and juices for diabetes (e.g. karela, and carrot juice). Tablets and capsules such as ginseng, Echinacea, senna, green tea, acai berry, and primrose oil were often bought from places such as Holland and Barrett, pharmacies, and other health shops. Ayurvedic and Chinese traditional herbal tablets for digestion (e.g. Triphala and churan), diabetes and weight loss were bought from India, Ramdev centres (both in the UK and abroad), and Chinese herbal shops. One of the participants who selected the 'Other' option described a sap which is harvested from the mountains in India known as Shilajeet used to improve blood circulation, good for people who have had a stroke, and has many other health benefits associated (Wilson et al., 2011). 0102030405060708090100Fresh herbs Dry Powders Seeds Tablets/CapsulesLiquidformulationsCreams/PastesOtherNumber of ParticipantsTypes of Herbal FormulationsHerbal Formulations UsedFigure 2-13 The Types of Herbal Formulations Used By Participants 42 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 4: After using herbal remedies do you notice any unwanted effects? If YES please state. Of the 126 participants who stated they did use herbal remedies, 87% (n=110) said they did not experience any unwanted effects after taking HMs; while 13% (n=16) claimed they had. Generally, participants commented on how HMs were natural and so safer to use, with no side-effects. Ideologies that HMs were designed by God to help people heal themselves naturally were mentioned by participants in this survey. The notion that people think HMs are natural and therefore safe has been documented by many other researchers too (Newall et al., 1996; Ipsos MORI, 2008). The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) commissioned an investigation into the public's perceptions of herbal medicines in 2008; the report revealed that just one in ten participants were aware that some HMs have side effects (Ipsos MORI, 2008). The unwanted effects reported by participants are summarised in Table 2-2. Some of the effects noted can be classed as minor as they are intermittent effects; for example excessive gas or wind produced by some herbals (participant 61) or a sore throat caused by the consumption of ginger (participant 72). Participant 42 claimed that adverse effects could be easily managed with the correct knowledge and gave the example of how the effects from 'garam' things can be counteracted by taking some orange juice, which has an opposite effect. On the other hand, some adverse effects mentioned were more serious and potentially life threatening, as reported by participant 116, who reported fresh blood in his stools after consuming HMs. Defining the concept of garam and bhye: The term 'garam' when translated into English literally means hot. Garam is a concept used by SAs to classify ingredients which warm up the body. In Ayurvedic and other traditional medical systems the term describes substances which heat the blood or warm the body temperature. Participants identified ingredients such as: ajwain, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coconut, cardamoms, dates, garlic, ginger, karela, peanuts, and turmeric as being garam. According to the research participants, when garam ingredients are consumed in excess the side-effects of an overheated internal system can include: nose bleeds, dizziness, palpitations, sweating, itching, and gastric disturbances (e.g. diarrhoea or acid reflux). Nevertheless, the importance of consuming garam foods in proportion was highlighted for keeping the body healthy, and was useful for treating conditions such as arthritis and diabetes. Some garam foods should be avoided during pregnancy due to the risk of a miscarriage; for example, mangos and papaya during the first few months, while tulsi should be avoided throughout the entire pregnancy (Winston and Maimes, 2007). During the 43 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra distribution of the questionnaire several participants made reference to Western medicines as being garam. This may be because the side-effects from CWM are similar to those experienced after consuming garam substances, or because some of the active ingredients fall into the same category as other garam substances. Participant 2 claimed, ''paracetamol is garam and I cannot take too much, as if I do I start itching, especially in my head!'' Itching is a documented side-effect caused by paracetamol (Joint Formulary Committee, 2014). There is no straight forward translation for the term 'bhye'. In contrast to garam ingredients which cause heat, bhye ingredients have the opposite effects; so Bhopal (1986b) refers to them as 'cold' substances. It is a term used to describe an internal imbalance, to which there is no equivalent term in Western medicine. Symptoms of bhye can include: nausea, feeling bloated, excessive gas production, increased salivation, and mucus production. Substances participants identified as being bhye include: rice, pulses, potatoes, carrots, turnips, melon, lemon, oranges, okra, and cauliflower. Once again it was highlighted by the research participants that these ingredients are vital for a well-balanced internal system but deficiency or excess can cause adverse effects. Table 2-2 Unwanted Effects Experienced After Using Herbal Remedies Participant Number: Unwanted Effects From Herbal Remedies Reported by Participants: 20 ''Too much of certain ingredients can cause side effects for example when I have pure honey and turmeric mixed together for a sore throat it gives a painful burning sensation.'' 22 ''Dushanda used for high temperatures gives me phlegm- because it is bhye.'' 23 ''Some types of masalas give me diarrhoea, as they are garam.'' 29 ''Mustard oil causes sickness/ allergy.'' 40 ''Too much neem can cause dizziness (feel faint and dizzy) so to counteract this side-effect have some ghee with it.'' 42 ''If I have too much garam food like ginger or garlic, I drink some orange juice because it is bhye so will balance the imbalance.'' 47 ''Taking too much ajwain makes me dizzy.'' 61 ''Some ingredients cause wind.'' ''Discolouring of teeth, e.g. haldi causes teeth to look yellow.'' 65 ''Karela juice is great for diabetes but it should not be too taken too often as it is strong and it can affect the liver.'' 66 ''Too much honey is bad for blood pressure.'' 70 ''I was getting hot flushes when taking saunf, ajwain and ginger mixture; because they are garam they warm the blood so they can cause hot flushes.'' 72 ''Too much adrak (ginger) causes irritation to the throat (throat feels like it is ulcerated)'' 73 ''Haldi caused stomach ache as it is garam in excess caused side-effects so had to stop it for a while.'' 44 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 82 ''Too much aloe vera can cause diarrhoea' 105 ''Too much ginger powder (ganthora) which was used for cramps affected my stomach ulcer, as it is so garam.'' 113 ''Garlic gives me burps.'' 116 ''I got very bad diarrhoea and fresh blood in my stools after taking some Baba Ramdev medicines while in India. I felt like I was going to die and it was very scary. I called the Ramdev hospital where I was being treated for my diabetes and the herbal doctor just said stop taking the medicine immediately, which I did. After that experience I would never trust that medicine again, I do not know what could have happened.'' ''Feels very hot (body temperature) when has cinnamon, as it is garam.'' From the analysis of the survey it should be noted that the definition of unwanted effects or side-effects may be different amongst SA and Western communities. During the distribution of the questionnaire it was obvious that some effects caused by the consumption of HMs were not accepted as side-effects. For example, if a remedy consumed for a headache caused GI disturbances (e.g. excessive belching, diarrhoea, or flatulence) it was believed the body was excreting the excess waste products from the body to resolve the ailment. Sometimes the undesirable effects were thought to be part of the process of recovery (Pole, 2008). In addition, there are differences in diagnosis, treatment, and side-effect profiles between cultures. This can be exemplified in the diagnosis and acceptance of various health conditions, such as mental health problems. Traditionally in SA communities the cause of mental health problems may have been due to black magic/ witchcraft/ evil spirits, or the will of God due to previous sins and bad deeds (Time to Change, 2010). The theories behind the cause of mental health and method of treatment are different in SA and Western cultures. This highlights that traditional and Western systems may perceive and treat illnesses in diverse ways. Due diligence is required when conducting research in SA populations as concepts can easily be misinterpreted. Whilst conducting the surveys the researcher was always mindful of such differences and asked the participants to explain concepts fully. Table 2-2 Unwanted Effects Experienced After Using Herbal Remedies Continued... 45 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 5: Where did you learn about herbal remedies? Participants who said they used herbal remedies for their health, were then asked where they had gained this knowledge from (i.e. family, friends, GP, Pharmacist, educational institute, or other); 80% (n=101) of participants stated, 'from their family' (Figure 2-14). Knowledge of HMs was gained from both male and female family members. Participant 29 mentioned her grandfather was an Ayurvedic practitioner and participant 87 said her father was an Ayurvedic practitioner. However, most participants made reference to their mums as being the main source of learning about HMs. The transmission of knowledge of HMs has been passed on by word of mouth throughout history, from one generation to the next (Chhetri, 1994; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Bhatia et al., 2014). This reinforces the key role that family play in passing on this valuable knowledge. Throughout the SATMED questionnaire any references to family and friends is combined in the option 'family/ friends'; this is because in SA cultures friends are often referred to as family, as are neighbours and people from the same village. The distinction between family and friends is not always the same as in Western cultures. However, for the purpose of this question, to establish exactly where participants learnt about HMs, the option was split into individual components i.e. family or friends instead of family and friends. Just three participants (2%) specified that they had learnt about HMs from their friends. One participant (1%) said she learnt about HMs from her school in India, as it was part of the curriculum. The option of GP or Pharmacist was not selected by any of the respondents. Participants who selected 'other' as their option (17%, n=21) for this question, said they learnt about HMs from a variety of places such as: the television (in particular the Asian channels such as Astha which airs Baba Ramdev remedies, and ZeeTV), radio, internet (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube), herbal shops (e.g. Holland and Barrett), traditional healers, and from their religion (two participants spoke about the value of black seed in Islam). There was some discussion amongst participants about how the media was introducing them to HMs. Several participants claimed while using social media websites 80%2%1% 17%Participants Learnt About Herbal Remedies From:FamilyFriendsEducationalinstituteOtherFigure 2-14 Where Participants Learnt About Herbal Remedies 46 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra and applications, such as Facebook and Twitter, the adverts which pop up are often about HMs. Usually HMs for hair and weight loss were advertised; however, this had led the participants to look into other HMs of interest. Participants 120 and 123 explained that they often researched on the internet for natural remedies. As did participant 165 who said she often watched YouTube videos to see how to make various herbal facemasks for her acne. Kanthe (2010) suggests the media can have a significant role in influencing peoples' decision to try herbal products; this was true for some of the participants in this study. The results from this question have revealed that the principle route of transmission of knowledge of HMs is from family. The traditional knowledge of HMs has often been passed on from parents and grandparents. Each family may have their own formulation, dosage, and duration of treatment which has been optimised through generations of traditional use (Bhamra, 2011). However, with advances in technology, popularity of social media, and the ease of access to a vast array of information, the way people are learning about HMs is changing (Hegg, 2013). 47 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The following questions are inclusive of all 192 participants responses. Question 6: Is herbal medicine part of your traditional family & cultural background? SA countries are rich sources of natural remedies and are renowned for their long standing use of HMs (Bhatia et al., 2014). Pieroni et al. (2010) claims that HMs are embedded in the cultural heritage of SAs and is a representation of identity of migrant communities. This question was asked to determine the current status of such traditions amongst SA populations in the UK, and to determine whether or not the knowledge of HMs is being passed onto generations born in the UK. WHO (2008) states that in some Asian and African countries more than 80% of the population still depends on traditional HMs for their primary health care. In this study the majority of participants are first generation immigrants (n=108) or second generation citizens (n=75) in the UK; therefore, it is assumed that HMs will be part of their traditional family background. The significant majority of participants in this research (85%, n=163) said HMs were part of their heritage; this suggests that SA communities in the UK are aware of the traditional use of HMs, regardless of whether or not they use HMs themselves (Figure 2-15). Only 15% (n=29) of participants said HMs were not part of their traditional family background. Analysis of the results revealed that most of the participants who stated HMs were not part of their traditional family and cultural background were in the young age group (n=15, of which 12 participants were second generation citizens), born in the UK (n=16), with at least one or both parents also born in the UK."
