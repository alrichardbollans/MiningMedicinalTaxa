Proper function-ing and performance of software and computer systems play a major role in obtaining consistency, reliability and accuracy of data. Therefore, computer system validation (CSV) should be part of any good development and manufacturing practice. It is also requested by EU and FDA regulations and guidelines through the overall requirement that \"equipment must be suit-able for its intended use\".Specific requirements for computers can be found in sec-tion 211.68 of the US cGMP regulations (USC, 2008). * Automatic, mechanical, or electronic equipment or other types of equipment, including computers, or related systems that will perform a function satis-factorily, may be used in the manufacture, process-ing, packing, and holding of a drug product. If such equipment is so used, it shall be routinely calibrat-ed, inspected, or checked according to a written pro-gram designed to assure proper performance. Writ-ten records of those calibration checks and inspec-tions shall be maintained. * Appropriate controls shall be exercised over comput-er or related systems to assure that changes in master production and control records or other records are instituted only by authorized personnel. * Input to and output from the computer or related system of formulas or other records or data shall be checked for accuracy. * The degree and frequency of input/output verifica-tion shall be based on the complexity and reliability of the computer or related system. * A backup file of data entered into the computer or re-lated system shall be maintained except where cer-tain data, such as calculations performed in connec-tion with laboratory analysis, are eliminated by com-puterization or other automated processes. In such instances a written record of the program shall be maintained along with appropriate validation data. * Hard copy or alternative systems, such as duplicates, tapes, or microfilm, shall be designed to assure that backup data are exact and complete and that it is se-cure from alteration, inadvertent erasures, or loss shall be maintained.Specific requirements for computers and electronic re-cords and signatures are also defined in FDA's regulations 21 CFR Part 11 on electronic Records and Signatures (USC, 1997).The Good Automated Manufacturing Practices Forum (GAMP) has developed guidelines for computer validation. All these guidelines and publications follow a couple of prin-ciples:* Validation of computer systems is not a onetime event. It starts with the definition of the product or project and setting user requirement specifications and cover the vendor selection process, installation, initial operation, going use, and change control and system retirement. * All publications refer to some kind of life cycle mod-el with a formal change control procedure being an important part of the whole process. * There are no detailed instructions on what should be tested. All guidelines refer to risk assessment for the extent of validation.Validation of computer systems is not a once off event. Annex 11 of the European GMP directive is very clear about this: Validation should be considered as part of the complete life cycle of a computer system. This cycle includes the stag-es of planning, specification, programming, testing, commis-sioning, documentation, operation, monitoring and modify-ing\" (EC, 2010).Scope The scope of this work is to present the validation of ERP SAP computer system used in Alkaloid AD Skopje known as AlkaSAP system.S2 PP 110238Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 237 - 238 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsBackgroundAlkaSAP system was implemented in Alkaloid AD Sko-pje in 2007. Within AlkaSAP there are several 'modules', each of which contains transactions in order to perform nec-essary tasks to complete business processes. Several of these tasks and processes are considered critical or have regulatory implications to Alkaloid. The SAP implemented modules in Alkaloid AD Skopje in 2007 were: 1. Sales & Distribution (SD)2. Production Planning (PP)3. Quality Management (QM)4. Materials Management (MM)5. Financial Accounting (FI)6. Controlling (CO)During 2014 additional SAP module concerning human capital management (HCM) was implemented. Validation of the AlkaSAPValidation of the AlkaSAP system was made in accor-dance with GAMP 4. All validation activities were defined in Validation Master Plan (VMP). The validation programme was divided into phases according to the validation life cy-cle. Each phase was divided into tasks and for every task there were actions, responsibilities and associated procedures. Specification / Design PhaseDuring this phase the following documents were created:Validation Master Plan (VMP); User Requirement Spec-ification (URS); Functional Specification (FS); Risk Assess-ment (RsA); Hardware Design Specification (HDS); Software Design Specification (SDS); Code Review (CR);Testing phaseBoth hardware and software elements were tested as part of the AlkaSAP implementation.Hardware Acceptance TestingHardware Acceptance Testing (including Infrastructure) was conducted successfully on all servers.Document reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP HATSSoftware Acceptance TestingAll bespoke and functional application software identi-fied in the Functional Specification or Software Design Speci-fication was tested against the Software Acceptance test Spec-ification.Document Reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP SATSSoftware Performance Test SpecificationAll software identified in the Functional Specification or Software Design Specification was given a risk priority and was tested against the Software Performance Test Specifica-tion:Document Reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP SPTSIn accordance with risk priority given in the Risk Assess-ment tests were executed as Detailed Functional Tests; User Acceptance Tests; Business ScenariosValidation ReportThe Validation Report has been issued as a phased report for the purpose of 'go-live' for the AlkaSAP and summarizes the validation programme activities.Document Reference: CSV VMR AlkaSAPOngoing Operation and EvaluationIn order to control and maintain the validation status of the AlkaSAP system, the following procedures are established and written:Policies and Procedures for Security and Access to serv-ersPolicies and Procedures for Back Up, Restore and Ar-chiveProcedures for Training and Operating of the systemPeriodic reviewPeriodic Reviews of the System is covered by Alkaloid Guideline ensuring SOPs, validation documentation and re-cords are audited on a regular basis to evaluate the effective-ness of controlling procedures.SummaryAlkaloid AD Skopje started 'go-live' with the validated AlkaSAP computer system. The validation test results were of sufficient detail and quality to establish that this computer sys-tem does what it purports to do. AlkaSAP still remains status of \"validated system\" which can be proved with regular periodic review of the system.ReferencesAlkaSAP Validation Master Plan version 2.0, 21st November 2006.European Commission (EC), 2010.

There are 400 - 500 compounds that have been identified in its extracts, and among them approximately 70 are C21 terpenophenols, members of a group known as cannabinoids, specific for this plant (ElSohly and Slade, 2005; Fischedick, et al., 2009; Turn-er, et al., 1980). The constituent of Cannabis sativa L., D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9THC), is the primary psychoac-tive cannabinoid. Given that the main pharmacological and psychoactive effects have been attributed to this com-pound, the most of the studies have been focused on its ef-fects (Costa, 2007). The effects of Cannabis sativa L. are not solely due to 9THC because cannabidiol (CBD) was found to cause pharmacological effects (Russo and Guy, 2006). It was shown that CBD and other cannabinoids achieve synergy with 9THC causing potentiation of ben-efits, antagonism of adverse effects, summation, pharma-cokinetic advantages, and metabolism (Russo and Guy, 2006). Many countries became more liberal towards medici-nal use of Cannabis sativa L. (Baker et al., 2003). Recent-ly there has been an increasing interest in development of cannabinoids and Cannabis sativa L. preparations as legiti-mate medicines for a variety of medical applications. Some of them include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, glaucoma, asthma and cardiovascular condi-tions, and as an antiemetic (Williamson and Evans, 2000). Cannabidoids are very potent compounds and their control in Cannabis sativa L. preparations is very important, espe-cially because their potential users are patients which al-ready have serious health problems. The aim of this study was to apply our in-house HPLC/DAD method on the Cannabis sativa L. preparations pres-ent in the European market and to control their quality.Materials and methodsThe samples of Cannabis sativa L. preparations were purchased from the European market, produced by Endoca (Pharmaceutical Company, Denmark). The standard sub-stances were obtained from Lipomed AG (Switzerland). The samples of standard substances were: 9-THC (3-pen-tyl-6,6,9-trimethyl-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-dibenzo(b,d)pyran-1-ol), delivered as 1 mL ampule solution (5 mg/ mL prepared in ethanol, with purity 98.52%, m/m) and CBD ((-)-trans-2-p-mentha-1,8-dien-3-yl-5-pentylresorcinol) as the solid substance (99.73%, m/m). The solvents used dur-ing the analysis were with HPLC grade. For the chromatographic analysis Agilent Technolo-gies HPLC system 1200 series (Germany) was used. The analysis was performed on HPLC-column: Purospher(r) Star RP18e (150 mm x 4.6 mm ID, 5 um) from Merck KGaA (Germany) using mobile phase composed of ace-tonitrile and water in gradient mode with acetonitrile from 50%, V/V, to 80%, V/V, at flow rate 1.5 mL/min, tempera-ture 30 degC, detection at 220 nm, injection 10 uL, in 31 min run time. The working solutions of standard substance CBD were prepared in methanol in two concentration ranges: S2 PP 111240Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 239 - 240 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentations95.48 ug/mL - 286.43 ug/mL and 103.13 ug/mL - 309.40 ug/mL. The 9THC working solutions were prepared in methanol in concentration range: 9.81 ug/mL - 19.63 ug/mL. The sample solutions were prepared by liquid/liquid extraction technique using a mixture of methanol and chlo-roform (9:1). When the layers were clearly separated, the sample from the methanolic layer was applied in HPLC/DAD system. Results and discussionFive different Cannabis sativa L. preparations pur-chased from the European market were analyzed. All were prepared from hemp oil with various amounts of CBD as active compound and naturally contains 9-THC, as an im-purity. According to the certificates the amount of CBD was: 3%; 5%; 10 %; 15% and 30%, m/m, and expected im-purity as 9THC was limited at maximum of 0.20%, m/m.For preparation of the samples we used the recom-mended United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime meth-od (UNODC Manual, 2009). For identification and quan-tification of cannabinoids we used our in-house chromato-graphic gradient method which we have proposed for hemp seed oil analysis (Shishovska et al., 2014) because of the similarity of samples in origin and form. In the analyzed samples of hemp oil preparations can-nabidiol and 9THC were identified and quantified. Iden-tifications were done by comparing of the retention times and UV spectra of standard compounds with retention times of peaks at the chromatograms of samples and their UV spectra. The retention times of CBD and 9THC peaks were 15.9 min and 21.0 min, respectively.For the quantification, data obtained from the chro-matograms were calculated using the method of the cal-ibration curve (constructed as concentration, c (ug/ml), versus peak area, A (mAU)). The analyzed working solu-tions of the active compound CBD and the trace compound 9THC showed high linearity in the working ranges. The estimated coefficient of the linearity for CBD working so-lutions at concentration range: 95.48 ug/mL - 286.43 ug/mL was 1.000 (A = 23688 c + 16.188); while for the CBD working solutions at concentration range: 103.13 ug/mL - 309.40 ug/mL it was 0.9998 (A = 39613 c + 31.129), and for the working solutions of standard substance 9THC at concentration range: 9.81 ug/mL - 19.63 ug/mL it was 0.9997 (A = 25269 c - 7.0738).It was found that content of cannabidiol in analyzed samples is from 109.7% to 125.4%, m/m of the declared values. The assays of 9THC traces at the samples vary according the concentration of the active compound. As quantities of CBD at samples were lower (3 - 5%), the as-say of 9THC is under the allowed maximum limit (0.02% - 0.14%), but at samples with higher concentrations of CBD (10 - 30%) the 9THC traces are above the allowed maximum limit (0.45% - 1.14%).ConclusionThe satisfactory chromatographic data proved that our in-house gradient HPLC/DAD method can be successful-ly used for determination of the active substance CBD and traces of 9THC in Cannabis sativa L. preparations. The results obtained for the analyzed samples of Cannabis sati-va L. preparations showed higher amounts of CBD than de-clared value in the certificate (differences range from 9.7% m/m to 25.4%, m/m). In two samples, the amount of 9THC found was under allowed maximum limit of 0.20%, while in three samples the amount was above that value."
