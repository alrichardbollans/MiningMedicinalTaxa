      "text": "The most commonly used technique for the determination of Pb and Cd is a graphite furnace atom-ic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) after microwave di-gestion (Kenneth, 2014; Belc et al., 2014).This article will present the use of GFAAS for the de-termination of Pb and Cd in a variety food samples.Materials and methodsChemicalsAll solutions were prepared in polypropylene volu-metric flasks using ultra pure deionized water. All the plas-tic and glassware were cleaned by soaking in dilute HNO3 (1+9), were rinsed with distilled water and air dried before use. All reagents used (nitric acid 65%, hydrochloric acid 30%, hydrogen peroxide 30%) were of Suprapure quality (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Lead and cadmium stock solutions, 1000 mg/L (Mer-ck, Darmstadt, Germany) are commercially available. Cadmium and lead working solutions were prepared fresh daily by dilution of the cadmium and lead stock solutions with 0.5% (v/v) nitric acid.Mixtures of palladium [(Pd(NO3)2] and magnesium ni-trate [Mg(NO3)2x6H2O] in deionized water was used for Cd analysis. Ammonia phosphate [NH4H2PO4] and magne-sium nitrate [Mg(NO3)2x6H2O] was used for Pb analysis. Matrix modifiers were added automatically to each blank and samples. SamplesDifferent samples were bought from local markets and/or were brought to our laboratory by border health inspec-tors: 160 cereal samples and their products (113 wheat, 40 wheat flour, 4 barley; 3 oat flakes); 13 piper samples; 5 on-ion samples, 3 garlic samples; 2 cabbage samples; 2 beet-root samples; 4 mushrooms samples and 7 potato samples.Sample preparationThe samples were dried at 105 @C for 24 h. Dried samples were homogenized using an agate pestle and stored in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles until analysis.Microwave digestion system Multiwave 3000 Anton Paar equipped with quartz vessels Q80, was used for sam-ple preparation. The samples were rapidly digested in a mi-crowave oven. Samples of 300 mg each were accurately weighed into the digestion vessels, followed by the addi-tion of nitric acid (65%), and/or hydrochloric acid (30%) and/or hydrogen peroxide (30%), all suprapure quality. A blank digest was carried out in the same way. Than ves-sels were placed into the rotor and heated in the microwave oven, according to the temperature program recommended by the manufacturer. The rotor was removed from the mi-S3 PP 135290Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 289 - 290 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationscrowave oven and allowed to cool to room temperature. The vessels were carefully opened in a fume cupboard and the inner walls rinsed with ultra pure deionized water. The final volume of each sample was made up to 20 mL with. All sample solutions were clear.GF AAS conditions All samples were analyzed using a GFAAS. The wave-length and GFAAS instrument parameters for the determi-nation of lead and cadmium are according to the MKC EN 14083:2010. A Perkin Elmer A Analyst 600 was used for heavy metals analyses, equipped with THGA Graphite Furnace and Zeeman background correction, AS-800 Au-tosampler. Winlab 32 software for the acquisition and pro-cessing of data was used.Methods Calibrations were performed using external standards. The limits of detection (LOD) were calculated as triplicate, and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were calculated as six times the standard deviation of repeated measurement of a blank solution. The accuracy of the method was tested by lead and cadmium reference materials with certified known lead and cadmium content and expressed through z-scores re-sults (-2 <= z <= 2). Recovery checks were carried out us-ing spikes.Repeatability was estimated for lead and cadmium, based on standard deviation and relative standard devia-tion, using the data from the QC sample analyses.Results and discussionThree working standard solutions were used for the linearity testing. Lead was calibrated at 10 ug/l, 20 ug/l and 30 ug/l, resulting in a calibration correlation coeffi-cient (R2) of > 0.999. Cadmium was calibrated at 1 ug/l, 2 ug/l and 3 ug/l, resulting in a calibration correlation coef-ficient (R2) of > 0.999. The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.2 ug/l for Pb and 0.1 ug/l for Cd. The limits of quantification (LOQ) were 0.5 ug/l for Pb and 0.3 ug/l for Cd. The values obtained matched closely with the certified values (z- score for Cd was 0.1 and for Pb - 0.3). The obtained results were satis-factory, showing levels of Pb and Cd close to the allowed levels of concentration. The recoveries of the trace metals were in the range from 95% for Cd and 103% for Pb. The standard deviations were less than 5%.Lead content of almost all cereal samples is bellow 0.2 mg/kg limit according to national regulation (Official Ga-zette of Republic of Macedonia, 102/2013), except for the six samples where the concentration of lead was 0.574 mg/kg, 0.820 mg/kg, 0.901 mg/kg, 0.721 mg/kg, 0.255 mg/kg and 0.385 mg/kg. These concentrations exceed the maxi-mum allowed concentration. Cadmium content of all ce-real samples is bellow 0.2 mg/kg according to the nation-al regulations. Lead and cadmium content of all vegetables samples (onion, garlic, beetroot, and potato) is bellow 0.1 mg/kg (maximum permitted limits by national regulation). Lead content of piper samples is bellow 0.1 mg/kg and for cabbage and mushrooms is bellow 0.3 mg/kg, (maxi-mum permitted limits by national regulation). Cadmium content is bellow 0.05 mg/kg for piper and 0.2 mg/kg for cabbage and mushrooms.ConclusionThe proposed method for trace heavy metal determi-nation in food samples showed satisfactory value for re-covery, detection limits and standard deviation. Therefore, it can be recommended as suitable procedure for routine analysis of heavy metals in variety food matrices.ReferencesKenneth, O., 2014.

Macedonia2Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss.Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* suzanaangelova@yahoo.comIntroductionAflatoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced mostly by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Among them, aflatoxin B1 exhibits the highest toxicity and carcinogenetic and it can be found in many commodities (groundnuts, nuts, cereals and their products, dried fruits, herbs) (Soleimany et al., 2012). The International Agen-cy for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified naturally oc-curring aflatoxin B1 as carcinogenic to humans - Group 1. Total aflatoxin content in food is regulated by legis-lation worldwide - Commission Regulation 466/2001, 2174/2003 and 1881/2006. Our country has adopted the EU regulations since December 2005 - 118/2005. Different analytical methods are used for aflatoxins analysis. The HPLC methods for mycotoxin analysis have gained more attention due to their efficiency and high sen-sitivity, especially when fluorescence detection is used since it provides high selectivity, low LOQ and accurate analysis. Since only the aflatoxins B2 and G2 show natu-ral fluorescence, B1 and G1 must be derivatized prior to de-tection. This can be done photo chemically using irradia-tion with UV light at 254 nm. The aflatoxins B1 and G1 are thus hydroxylated, leading to stable and measureable fluo-rescence (Ibanez -Vea et al., 2011; Ren et al., 2007). Very important aspect concerning mycotoxin analysis is sample preparation and clean-up procedure. Application of immu-noaffinity column (IAC) provides clean extracts due to the specificity of the antibody, applicability to complex matri-ces, good precision, accuracy and sensitivity of analytical methods (Scott et al., 1997). The aim of this article was determination of B1 affla-toxin and total aflatoxins in some foodstuffs collected from local supermarkets, using immunoaffinity column clean-up procedure and liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.Materials and methodsChemicalsHPLC grade reagents (methanol, acetonitril, water) and chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). For clean-up purification immunoaffinity col-umns Afla-OtaCLEAN LCTech, Germany was used. Afla-toxins mix from Supelco, with concentrations of B1 1.026 ug/ml, B2 0.311 ug/ml, G1 1.046 ug/ml and G2 0.322 ug/ml were used as standards.SamplesMany different commodities, cereal samples and their products (94), nuts (17), dried fruits (55), spices (33) and sunflowers seeds (12) were brought to our laboratory by border health inspectors or food operators during 2015 year.The samples were kept in their original packages in dark, dry and cool place before analyzed.Sample preparationThe extraction and purification of aflatoxins was per-formed according to LCTech sample extraction and clean-up procedure. According to the matrix, the appropriate method was selected. For non fatty matrices e.g. wheat and maize, 20 g of sample was extracted with 100 ml metha-nol: water (8:2 V/V) in a blender jar at a high speed for five minutes. For fatty matrices (nuts, paprika, and chilli) as well as for spices (black pepper, coriander, cumin, ginger), 20 g of tested samples with addition of 2 g NaCl, was ex-S3 PP 136292Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 291 - 292 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationstracted with 100 ml methanol: water (8:2 V/V) and 50 ml of n-hexane. The mixture was filtered through a fluted fil-ter paper or centrifuged. The purified extract (14 ml) was added to an 86 ml PBS buffer (pH 7.2) and filtered again through 0.2 um microfiber filter paper. 50 ml of the sec-ond filtrate (for spices maximum 14 ml) was quantitative-ly passed through the immunoaffinity column. The column was washed with 10 ml of water. Then, eluted with at 2 ml of methanol and measured directly by HPLC (ISO 16050, 2012).HPLC conditions HPLC analysis was performed with Agilent Technol-ogies 1260 Series chromatographic system equipped with vacuum degasser G4225A, Binary Pump G1312B, Auto sampler G1329E, Column Compartment G1316C. Fluores-cence Detector G1321B and UVE System for Photochem-ical derivatization LC Tech The UVE(tm) (LCTech, Germa-ny). Post-column photochemical derivatization was used to increase the sensitivity of detection of Aflatoxins B1 and G1. Aflatoxins were separated on ZORBAX Eclipse plus C18 Column 4.6 x 100 mm, 3.5 um at room temperature. The mobile phase was a mixture of water:acetonitril:methanol (63:11:26, V/V/V). The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the in-jection volume was 10 ul. The detection was carried out at and data were acquired using Agilent life Sciences Open-LAB CDS ChemStation software.MethodsThe limit of detection (LOD) was 3:1, calculated as S/N. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 10: 1, S/N. Re-covery, as a part of method performance evaluation, was determined according to the method of standard addition. Repeatability was estimated for B1 and B2, based on stan-dard deviation and relative standard deviation, using the data from the QC sample analyses.Results and discussionThree-point calibration curves were linear in the pro-posed concentration range for all four aflatoxins and they had satisfactory coefficient of correlation (R2) in the range of 0.9991- 0.9996.Limits of detection were in the range 3 - 8 ug/kg for all four aflatoxins and limits of quantification were in the range of 9 - 23 ug/kg.The following fortified concentration levels were ap-plied: for B1 (5.0 ug/kg), for B2 (1.5 ug/kg), for G1 (5.0 ug/kg), for G2 (1.5 ug/kg), using an aflatoxin-free Trilo-gy reference material. For B1 the recovery was 93.93%, for B2 92.14%, for G1 100.96% and for G2 the recovery was 78.87%. Repeatability was 0.16% for B1 and 3.7% for B2.Laboratory for toxicological chemistry at PHI Cen-ter for Public Health Kumanovo took part in FAPAS Food Chemistry proficiency Test 04238 Aflatoxins B and G in Maize. Proficiency testing aims to provide an independent assessment of the competence of participating laboratories and is an essential element of laboratory quality assurance. The performance of the laboratory is shown with z-scores results (-2 <= z <= 2). Z- scores results for B1 was - 0.8, for B2 -1.1, for G1 -0.5, for G2 -1.5 and 0.9 for total aflatoxins. They were statistical satisfactory.Most of the cereals, nuts and dried fruits samples are below LOD. Two samples of red pepper powder had 1.486 ng/g and 1.612 ng/g total aflatoxins, respectively, which was below the permitted MRL of 10.0 ng/g. Four samples of sunflowers seeds had 28.7 ng/g, 19.4 ng/g/ 22.6 ng/g and 8.3 ng/g total aflatoxins, respectively. The values exceed-ing the maximum permissible limits of 4 ng/g set by na-tional regulative.ConclusionLiquid chromatography linked to fluorescence detec-tion (HPLC/FD) and system for photochemical derivatiza-tion is suitable for routine analysis of aflatoxins in many commodities. Limits of quantification, precision, and re-covery were satisfactory allowing it to be used also as a method for aflatoxins confirmatory analysis. ReferencesIbanez - Vea, M., Corcuera, L.
