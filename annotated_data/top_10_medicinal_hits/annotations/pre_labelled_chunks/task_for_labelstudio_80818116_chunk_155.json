This thesis is also suggested from Maisenbacher et al. (1992) who had examined a solution of hypericin in ac-etone after irradiation with a daylight lamp for 40 h and by UV/ VIS, IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy have given as-sumption of the basic structure of lipophilic hypericin- de-rivatives generated by photolysis of hypericin. It was sug-gested that St. John's Wort Oil red colour comes from the lipophilic breakdown products of hypericin (Kovar and Maisenbacher, 1992).On the other hand, with spectrophotometry method proposed in Ph. Helv. 11.0 the obtained results complied with the pharmacopoeial criteria and indicated presence of hypericin in the samples H2, B1 and B2. Presence of unidentified compounds detected in the HPLC chromatogram of St. John's Wort Oil indicated that further research should be done in order to explain the pos-sible chemical modification of hypericin like derivatives.ConclusionWithin this research, SPE procedure was successful-ly applied for separating hypericin and other phytocompo-nents from vegetable oil solution. Hypericin was not de-tected in St. John's Wort Oil by the proposed HPLC meth-od, although the content of hypericin derivatives, deter-mined by spectrophotometric method, was in compliance with the Ph. Helv 11.0. Analysis of the obtained results suggests possibility that the target component hypericin may undergo chemical modification as unidentified peaks were detected in the chromatogram of St. John's Wort Oil. Further analysis of different preparation methods for St. John's Wort Oil and their affection to hypericin content, stability testing of hypericin in vegetable oil, as well as quantitative and qualitative determination of the possible degradation products of hypericin are requiredReferencesAnyzewska, M., Fijalek, Z., Kowalczuk, A., Jablczunska, R., Lozak, A., 2010.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* belma.asanova@hotmail.comIntroductionA new core-shell silica particles were developed as a material for chromatographic stationary phases that can separate small and large molecules and complex samples, providing fast and high efficiency separations at pressures compatible with conventional HPLC equipment (Guiochon and Gritti, 2011). Core shell particles (also called fused-core(tm) particles, shell particles or controlled-surface-po-rosity particles) consist of a non porous silica core and a narrow shell of porous silica. Compared with convention-al columns with fully porous particles, core shell particles provide shorter diffusion paths of the analytes into the sta-tionary phase which significantly influence the separation parameters (Berger, 2011; Destefano et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2013). Core-shell columns have been mostly used for reversed-phase HPLC, as well as in hydrophilic interac-tion liquid chromatography (HILIC), chiral separation, two dimensional liquid chromatography and capillary electro-chromatography separation (Kirkland et al., 2013; Ruta et al., 2012). Transfer of the HPLC methods from columns packed with fully porous silica particles to core-shell col-umns provide significant time and cost savings, while maintaining column performance and minimizing operat-ing difficulties (Hayes et al., 2014).The aim of our work was to transfer the method for determination of related substances of metamizole sodi-um using the method described in the Ph.Eur. monograph (01/2008:1346) from conventional to core-shell column and to optimize the method for determination of related substances of metamizole in tablets.Materials and methodsChemicals and standards Metamizole sodium and metamizole impurity A, cer-tified reference standards, were purchased from EDQM (Strasbourg, France). Sodium dihydrogen phosphate, (Ph.Eur., grade for analysis) and triethylamine were purchased from Merck, Germany. Methanol (HPLC grade) was pur-chased from Carlo Erba Reagents, France. Water R, was obtained with a TKA-LAB Reinstwasser system (Nie-derelbert, Germany). Chromatographic Conditions HPLC separation was performed on Agilent 1200 LC Systems, using ChemStation software, Version B.04.03 for data acquisition and instrument control. The column used for the separation was Kinetex XB-C18, 50 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 mm (Phenomenex, Inc). Mixture of 28 volumes of meth-anol R and 72 volumes of a buffer solution containing 1000 volumes of a 6.0 g/L solution of sodium dyhidrogen phos-phate R and 1 volume of triethylamine R, pH 7.0, was used as a mobile phase. The column temperature was 25degC. Flow rate was 0.2 mL/min. Injection volume was 0.5 mL. UV detection was performed at 254 nm.Preparation of solutionsReference solution e, containing metamizole sodium (0.3 mg/mL) and metamizole impurity A (0.4 mg/mL) pre-pared as described in Ph.Eur. monograph (01/2008:1346) was used as system suitability solution.Test solution was prepared by dissolving a quantity of powdered tablets containing 500 mg metamizole and dilu-S8 OP 302634Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 633 - 634 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessiontion to 100, 0 ml of methanol. Reference solutions used for calculations were pre-pared according to the method for related substances de-scribed in Ph.Eur. monograph 01/2008:1346.Validation of the methodValidation of the method was performed according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guide-line on Validation of Analytical Procedures: Text and Methodology (ICH, 2005).Results and discussionThe method for simultaneous determination of met-amizole sodium and its two impurities (A and C) described in Ph.Eur. monograph (01/2008:1346) was transferred from conventional fully porous column (base deactivated octadecylsilyl silica gel for chromatography R, 0.25 m x 4.6 mm; 5 mm) to column based on core-shell technology (XB-C18, 50 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 mm) and optimized for de-termination of related substances of metamizole in tablets. Satisfactory system suitability requirements were ob-tained in total analysis time of 9 minutes (4.5 times of the retention time of metamizole, Rt = 2.15) and the value for resolution (Rs) between metamizole and impurity A (Rs = 3.11) fulfills the requirement of the Ph.Eur monograph (Rs >= 2.5). The purity ratio was within the calculated thresh-old limit (1.000) for both impurity A (0.128) and impuri-ty C (0.0197), confirming the purity of the peaks and spec-ificity of the method. The obtained values for number of theoretical plates (N=10187), retention factor (k'=1.88), symmetry factor (As=1.28) and relative standard deviation (RSD(Rt)=0.16%; RSD(peak area)=0.53%; n=6) for the peak of metamizole impurity A, indicate on a satisfactory column efficiency and adequate performance of the chro-matographic system. The results obtained from the regression analysis of the peak area (y) versus concentration (x), confirmed the linearity of the method (y = 6,476x + 2,417; R2 = 0.9999) in concentration range from 5 mg /mL to 50 mg /mL of met-amisole impurity A (5, 10, 20, 25, 30, and 50 mg/mL). The values for limit of detection (DL=0.33 ug/mL) and limit of quantification (QL= 0.99 ug/mL), determined from the residual standard deviation of the regression line and the slope are below the disregard limit (1.25 ug/mL) given in the Ph.Eur. monograph, indicating on satisfactory sensitiv-ity of the method. The repeatability of the method was confirmed from the values for the relative standard deviation (RSD), ob-tained from determination of the test solution (RSD = 2.26 %, n=6). Recovery values obtained from the determination of metamizole impurity A (81.3 % - 90.4 %) in the test so-lution (spiked with metamizole impurity A, at three differ-ent concentrations) confirmed that the method was accu-rate in the range of 80-120% of the working concentration. The results from the determination of the robustness of the method indicated that small but deliberate changes in the analytical conditions did not affect the system suitabil-ity parameters and that the method can be applied in rou-tine work.ConclusionThe results have shown that the optimized method us-ing core-shell column is suitable for determination of re-lated substances of metamizole in tablets containing met-amizole sodium, providing fast and highly efficient sepa-ration on conventional HPLC equipment, available in al-most any laboratory.ReferencesBerger, T.A., 2011.

Cyril & Methodius\", Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia2Euro-farm, Ognjan Prica 5, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* angela.arso@gmail.comIntroductionThe pharmacy profession is facing continuous evolve-ment toward patient (PT) oriented health care services in or-der to ensure the safe, effective and rational use of medi-cines. The areas of pharmacist practice are versatile - from activities concerned with PT care and public health to drug design and development, supply and dispensing (Traulsen and Almarsdottir, 2005). Currently 2413 pharmacists are li-censed at the pharmaceutical chamber of R. Macedonia, where 1107 are employed in CPs across the country (data obtained from Pharmaceutical chamber of Macedonia on 22.02.2016). Having in mind that a major area of licensed pharmacist (LP) settlements in R. Macedonia are CPs (~46% of all LPs), we conducted a survey (20.10.2014-20.01.2015) in order to establish a baseline in respect of CP activity, staff-ing, infrastructure etc. We hope that the results of the con-ducted survey will help for further development of CP sector.Materials and methodsFocus-methodology group approach was applied in the process of design and structuring of the questionnaire. It was conducted between 1-10 October, 2014 on 10 LP employed at CPs across the country in order to explore the level of understanding, acceptability (questions wording, complexity and ambiguity of proposed answers) as well as the time required to complete the questionnaire. After-wards the final questionnaire with 29 items was structured.The anonymous questionnaire covers data related to socio-demographic factors (city, age, gender and length of time registered as a LP), average number of PTs and pre-scriptions (Px) in the CP per week, location and workforce in the CP, services offered, continuing education and expe-riences and opinions related to e- Px. The questionnaire was distributed to 150 CPs across the country and 124 were returned. Only one questionnaire was in a group with more than 20% missing values and therefore 123 questionnaires were analyzed.Obtained data were tabulated using Microsoft Excel(r) (Microsoft Corp. Redmond, WA, USA) and were comput-ed and consequently evaluated using statistical software STATGRAPHICS Centurion XVI evaluation (StatPoint technologies Inc., USA)Results and discussionAccording to the data found on the web site of Mace-donian Agency for Drugs and Medicinal Products (http://malmed.gov.mk) there are 1019 registered pharmacies in R. Macedonia of which 846 (83%) are CPs (web site ac-cessed at 24.02.2016). The analyzed sample of 123 CPs covers 14.54% of all CPs in R. Macedonia pointing to sat-isfactory margin over target of necessary 10% to have re-liable results.Related to the profile of LP employed in CPs the av-erage age was 36.24 +- 9.89 years of which 96.7% were females. The average length of time registered as a LP was 10 +- 8.9 years. Only 2.4% have degree of postgradu-ate health-care specialist, and 1.6% were enrolled in such study at the time of survey.Most of the surveyed CPs (48.4%) were visited by up to 1000 PTs per week followed by those with 1000-2499 PTs (41.8%). The average number of dispensed Px items per week 500-999 (47.5%) preceded the ones with low-er than 500 (40.8%). Majority of the respondents (45.4%) stated that the number of dispensed Px per week issued by general practitioners was 500-900 while the specialists in 55.4% cases issued in average 100-499.
