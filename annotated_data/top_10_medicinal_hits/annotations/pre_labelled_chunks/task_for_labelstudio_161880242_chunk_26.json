SharifuddinChapter 6take into account the percentage of cell population that proliferated and attempting to progress through mitosis. The proportion of dead and dying cells were excluded. These short-term cytotoxicity parameters and the trypan-blue exclusion assay were reported to underestimate cytotoxicity (Fellowes & Donovan, 2007). Andrographolide was demonstrated to cause necrotic cell death in a dose- and exposure time-dependent manneri| rather than a prominent apoptotic response. At the top dose, andrographolide caused more than 50% cytotoxicity in the cell lines as indicated by RI, MI and trypan-blue measurements and significant reduction in cell number. Continuous exposure of MCL-5! cells to andrographolide for five cell cycles also showed that the compound maintain itsIcytotoxicity. Even though the in vitro micronucleus assay was not exclusively design for cell death measurement, the estimation of necrotic/apoptotic cell population after andrographolide exposure provided a valuable mechanistic information.The incidence of condensed chromatin, considered to be an indication of cell death was determined in V-79 cells exposed to andrographolide. The data revealed a dose-dependent pattern of dead cell population even after the treated cells were allowed to recover for one cell cycle in the absence of andrographolide and the percentage of dead cells was similar to those treated continuously (see Table 4.6). The incidence of aberrant centrosome number measured directly after exposure and the incremental increases in mitotic index even after the removal of andrographolide indicated that it profoundly affected the cell cycle mechanism, which in the long term may affect cell division and cell number.Furthermore, cell viability determined using the plating efficiency as discussed in Chapter 5, demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in growing AHH-1 cell colonies after 14-days of initial inoculation with the same cell concentration. Thus, based on the available data, andrographolide affected cell cycle kinetics via disruption to normal chromosome segregation and increased the mitotic index while a proportion of cell population exposed to the compound died primarily via necrosis in a dose-dependent manner. Disruption to normal cell division and chromosome damage as well as the cytotoxicity of the compound effectively reduced cell number. Furthermore, depending on the dose of exposure, the treated mammalian cells' ability to segregate normally might have been impeded evident from the persistence of cell cycle delay even in the absence of the phytochemical. The author believes that andrographolide may have a higher cytotoxicity than those measured using the previously stated parameters and even though the Relative Total GrowthCopy 1 220Y. SharifuddinChapter 6calculation was not determined, it can be proposed that based on the observation and plating efficiency figures that this phytochemical will inhibit normal cell proliferation.The results obtained would be more meaningful if the concentration of andrographolide presence in human serum is known or to what extent human exposure in vivo would be. At the moment, reliable data on this aspect is lacking. As stated earlier, many published works on this phytochemical tend to concentrate on the possible medical and therapeutic benefits of andrographolide, often overlooking the possible risks it might pose and the current lack of evidence in toxicity particularly genotoxicity may place the health of the public in jeopardy unless more information is obtained. History may not exactly repeat itself but it does tend to rhyme. Previous examples of herbal products that were not tested for its genotoxic potential such as Aristolochia fangchi, Piper methysticum and Teuchrium chamaedrys, to name a few, has been costly to public health and confidence.6.3 Further StudiesBased on the findings made in this thesis, various further studies can be carried out but not limited to those described below. * Since the methods employed to elucidate cell fate after aberrant mitosis due to centrosome amplification after andrographolide exposure is not very specific, time- lapsed video-microscopy on cell should be used to obtain a clearer picture. * Another round of in silico assessment using both DEREK and METEOR can be performed on the predicted metabolites of andrographolide, which will provide valuable additional insights. * In relation to the previous point and the results obtained, experiments to characterise the possible metabolites of andrographolide from AHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79 cell cultures can be performed for example by using mass spectrometry.Copy 1 221Y. SharifuddinChapter 6* Test the metabolites of this phytochemical to determine whether they can pose as agenotoxic threats and studies should also be performed on normal diploid humancells and cells with competent p53 activity. * Conducting microarray studies on gene expression for cells exposed toandrographolide to determine its impact on genes involved in cell death mainlyapoptosis, centrosome duplication and the mitotic checkpoint genes. Such studies would shed more lights on how andrographolide is affecting centrosome multiplication and cell death. * Experiments to further examine and quantitate the effects of andrographolide on mammalian cells using apoptosis specific assays such as the TUNEL and caspases- oriented technique can be performed. Several cell types should be employed to provide a better picture since andrographolide is known to exert cell-specific response. * Performing the in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay on larger samples with the aim of finding the threshold level of exposure since andrographolide behaves in an aneugenic manner. * Sequencing the HPRT \"mutants to obtain more information of the type of damage.6.4 ConclusionMajor conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are:* In silico assessment utilising expert knowledge-based program harnessing quantitative structure activity relationship such as DEREK and METEOR was useful in providing general initial information about andrographolide, where paucity of data exist. DEREK predicted that andrographolide is capable of causing skin sensitisation and chromosome damage in mammals in vitro. Whereas, METEOR predicted plausible Phase I and Phase II biotransformation routes of andrographolide that were in agreement with past published works.Copy 1 222Y. SharifuddinChapter 6* Andrographolide induced micronuclei formation in vitro in all three cell lines tested, primarily at the lower doses of the compound. Difference in cellular metabolic capabilities may explain the difference in the level of micronuclei incidence. * Andrographolide induced kinetochore positive micronuclei, hence may act in aneugenic manner. * The doses between 30 and 50pM induced high micronuclei frequency compared to other concentration tested and these doses also caused relatively high apoptotic response in scored cells. * Cytotoxicity measurement performed using replicative index calculation, microscopical identification and trypan-blue exclusion assay showed a similar trend in that andrographolide cytotoxicity is both time- and dose-dependent. Cell death was observed to be primarily via necrosis as opposed to programmed cell death. Micronuclei frequency was observed to generally increase in tandem with cytotoxicity, except at the top two concentrations of 70 and 90pM. This phytochemical also reduced cell growth as the concentration increased. However, the compound's cytotoxicity might have been underestimated. * Andrographolide instigated centrosome amplifications as the treatment dose increased and the presence of multiple MTOCs affected chromosomal segregation fidelity with corresponding increases in the mitotic index. * V-79 cells challenged with andrographolide for 24 hours and subsequently allowed to grow for a further 24 and 48 hours post-treatment still retained abnormal MTOCs number. * Centrosome numerical aberrations in V-79 cells challenged with andrographolide lead to anomalous mitoses where cells failed to undergo cytokinesis due to abnormal centrosome number, producing bi-, tri-, tetra- and multinucleated cells.Copy I 223Y. SharifuddinChapter 6Even in the absence of the phytochemical after the initial insult, there was still significant presence of abnormal mitoses. * Andrographolide elicited HPRT ~ mutants formation between 5 to 50pM and the induction is dose-related with 30pM induced the highest mutagenic response. Cell viability measured as plating efficiency showed that andrographolide affected cell growth and supported cytotoxicity assessment conducted earlier.All the studies completed in this thesis were conducted with the aim of adding value to the existing knowledge on andrographolide by determining its potential genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and shed more lights into its possible mode of action. There are various windows of opportunity in terms of necessary further work that can be pursued in the future, some of which have been outlined by the author earlier as there are still more questions need to be answered. Recently, self-organising map (SOM) analysis performed on andrographolide suggested that this phytochemical may possess novel mechanism(s) of action (Jada et al., 2007). Therefore the author would like to end his thesis as the novelist and lepidopterist, Vladimir Nabokov once put it, \"The greater one's science, the deeper the sense of mystery\".Copy 1 224BIBLIOGRAPHY AND APPENDIXCl Y.
