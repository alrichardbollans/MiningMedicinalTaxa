The main known ethnopharmacological indicationfor Veronica species are inflammatory diseases (rheumatism,stomach ulcer) or respiratory ailments (Scarlat et al., 1985;Mocan et al., 2015a), and several studies have shown thatiridoid glycosides in Veronica are linked to this therapeuticeffects (Scarlat et al., 1985; Grundemann et al., 2013; Ignjatovic',2015). Although regulatory guidelines to establish quality controlor authentication of Veronica herbal products are lacking, thepresence and concentration of specific iridoid glycosides hasbeen shown to enable authentication of Veronica herbal products(Cris,an et al., 2010; Grundemann et al., 2013).The HPLC-MS results from the present study show thecharacterization of Veronica herbal products against fourcommercially available iridoid glycosides, namely aucubin,catalpol, veronicoside and catalposide (Table 2). The twomost commonly identified compounds in the examined herbalproducts and reference plant material were aucubin and catalpol.From a pharmaceutical point of view, the concentrations ofthe compounds present in different herbal remedies or plantmaterials cannot be neglected as they are directly linked to theirpharmaceutical efficacy and effectiveness. Aucubin was found infifteen herbal products samples as well as in the reference plantmaterial of both species (V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys), withthe highest concentration in sample 9. Aucubin concentrationsin the herbal products and reference plant material show a largevariation with concentrations ranging from 0.33 to 39.73 ug/g.Catalpol was found in 13 herbal products, with the highestconcentration in sample 11, but was missing in two of thereference plant samples (V. off 4 and V. cha 1). No iridoidglycosides were identified in sample 14, a lozenge with nineteeningredients listed on the label. Jensen et al. (2005) concludes thataucubin and/or catalpol is/are present in all Veronica species,implying that if sample 14 contains any material of Veronica thiswould be below the level of detection of the HPLC-MS platformwe used in this study, and consequently unlikely to exert anypharmacological activity. Concerning the other two 6-O-estersof catalpol, veronicoside was present in five herbal products andin all V. officinalis reference material, with highest concentrationin sample V. off 1, while catalposide was present in nine herbalproducts, with the highest concentration in sample 8, but none ofthe investigated reference plant materials contained catalposide.Jensen et al. (2005) states that although aucubin and/or catalpolare present in all Veronica species, V. micrantha is the only speciesin Veronica subgenus Chamaedrys, to which V. chamaedrysbelongs, that contains aucubin. However, this assumption waslater rejected by Cris,an et al. (2010) that identified both aucubinand catalpol in V. chamaedrys, and as well as by the results of thisstudy.Genetic AnalysesBarcode Gap AnalysisSpecies-level identification using DNA barcoding andmetabarcoding requires that the level of intraspecific geneticdivergence is lower than the interspecific genetic divergence(Meyer and Paulay, 2005), and several identification approachesare based on setting a cut-off threshold above which a querysequence is considered to be distinct from a reference sequence.Defining an optimal threshold is a controversial debate (Hebertet al., 2004; Meyer and Paulay, 2005; Smith et al., 2005; Wiemersand Fiedler, 2007; Chen et al., 2013). Previous studies proposeddifferent thresholds of genetic distances, for instance, 1%(Ratnasingham and Hebert, 2013), 3% (Smith et al., 2005) or theFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378338fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 7Raclariu et al.

The three distance metricsused for the analyses produced identical initial partitions withineach dataset and for all the values of prior intraspecific diversity(P), but with a slight difference between the datasets, respectively,14 groups for nrITS and nrITS2 and 13 for nrITS1. The recursivepartitions resulted in a variable number of groups within eachdataset depending on P, respectively, with 18, 22, 37, and 53groups for nrITS dataset, 14, 19, and 37 groups for nrITS1, and16, 23, 31, and 54 groups for nrITS2 data set.Infra- and interspecific divergence based on pairwisecomparison of nrITS genetic distances of V. officinalis andV. chamaedrys (Supplementary Table S4) helped to identify anoptimal clustering threshold for analysis of high-throughputsequence data and accurate molecular identification anddiscrimination of the two species. Pairwise intraspecific geneticdistances did not exceed 1.5%, and furthermore 93.8% ofthe pairwise intraspecific distances were below 1%. Pairwiseinterspecific genetic distances, on the other hand, ranged from18 to 22%. The pairwise comparisons showed that applying97% or more similarity as a clustering threshold will confidentlydiscriminate V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys. These resultsare consistent with the ABGD analysis in which the sequencesbelonging to V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys were assignedto well defined independent groups using an a priori definedgenetic threshold of 1%.DNA MetabarcodingThe quantity of the total DNA extracted from the sixteen herbalproducts varied between samples. Total DNA concentrationmeasurement gave detectable results for 15 of the samples(93.7%), with DNA concentrations ranging from 0.06 to87.32 ng/ul, and nrITS1 and nrITS2 amplicons were obtainedfor all these samples. One sample, marketed as a lozenge,did not yield a measurable DNA concentration and noamplicons of nrITS1 and nrITS2 were obtained from this sample(Supplementary Table S5).The raw data before demultiplexing consisted of 2,638,101sequences, with an average of 82,440 sequences per samplefor each marker. Sequencing was successful for thirteen herbalproducts (81.3%) for both nrITS1 and nrITS2 and they wereused for further analysis (Table 3). Three products, two herbalteas (5, 16) and the lozenge (14), did not yield reads or MOTUsafter applying the quality filtering criteria and were excluded fromfurther analyses. A total of 63,929 sequences passed our trimmingand filtering quality criteria (2.4% of reads), including 19,788Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378339fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 8Raclariu et al.

The metabarcoding data is used for qualitative evaluationonly, to determine presence of identified taxa, and not forquantitative assessment of relative species abundance based onread numbers, as too many variables impact the values, such asthe availability of DNA that can be removed or degraded duringthe harvesting, drying, storage, transportation and processing(Bombardelli, 1991; Novak et al., 2007), as well as variation innrITS copy numbers, primer annealing and PCR amplificationbiases (Pawluczyk et al., 2015). Furthermore, incompletereference databases and incorrectly identified sequences inGenBank can impact taxonomic assignments.The choice of similarity clustering thresholds (>97, >99,and 100%) impacted the number and size of assigned MOTUs(Table 3). Setting the clustering threshold to 100% yielded1572 MOTUs, 99% yielded 824 MOTUs, and 97% yielded only287 MOTUs. The low number of MOTUs obtained using the97% clustering threshold is likely the result of multiple speciesbeing grouped together into the same MOTU as 3% divergencefar exceeds interspecific variation in many genera (Yang andRannala, 2017). Setting the clustering threshold to 100%, onthe other hand, likely resulted in more than one MOTU beingformed for a single taxonomic species as a result of infraspecificvariation and/or sequencing errors between reads. Here wefollowed previous studies in using a 99% clustering threshold(Ghorbani et al., 2016; Raclariu et al., 2017; Veldman et al.,2017). Furthermore, to limit the impact of sequencing errors,which are known to affect the Ion Torrent sequencing platform(Loman et al., 2012; Salipante et al., 2014) and which could leadto the formation of false MOTUs, we used only the clusters thatcontained a minimum 10 reads.The 824 MOTUs that were retained using a 99% similarityclustering threshold were further identified using BLAST as109 different species (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S6).Based on only nrITS1 we detected a total of 64 different speciesand on only nrITS2 61 species (Supplementary Table S6).Based on both markers, the number of species detected persample ranged from 2 to 32, with an average of 8 speciesper sample. Only two of the seven (28.6%) single ingredientsamples (those listing V. officinalis as the only ingredient)contained V. officinalis, three others contained V. chamaedrysand one contained other Veronica species, and all productscontained additional species, ranging from 1 to 21 speciesper product. None of the nine retained multiple ingredientsamples (i.e., those listing V. officinalis and other species on thelabel) contained only the listed ingredients, and none containedV. officinalis (Figure 1). The overall ingredient fidelity (detectedspecies from product label/total number of species on label)was 9.5% for the multiple ingredient products, and 17% for allproducts. The target species V. officinalis was detected in only2 products (15%), whereas V. chamaedrys was detected in eight(62%) of the retained samples. These results are supported bythe pairwise comparison of the genetic distances that showedthat V. officinalis could be unambiguously differentiated fromV. chamaedrys using standard arbitrary clustering thresholds(Supplementary Table S4). In sample 10 a mixture of severalVeronica species was detected, including V. bombycina Boiss.& Kotschy, V. filiformis Sm., V. pectinata, V. tenuifolia Asso,V. krumovii (Peev) Peev and V. chamaedrys. The presence ofthese species can be explained as substitutes, admixtures orcontaminants.
