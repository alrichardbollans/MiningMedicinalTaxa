      "text": "Often the marketer would prefer the product being classifi ed as food. For example, many products containing medicinal plants are in Germany classifi ed as herbal medicinal products requiring a Product License, but are in Great Britain sold as foods without any pre-market approval. Some of the vitamin preparations that are classifi ed as medicines in Finland are classifi ed as foods in several Member States. Preparations that contain the hormone melatonine are classifi ed as medicines in most European countries, but not all.14391438 Kroes 2006. 1439 Enkovaara 2002, 22.-262-If we applied for a classifi cation decision, and it resulted in our products being classifi ed as medicines because of medicinal functions, we would have three alternatives:Withdraw from all plans of marketing. -Apply for authorisation as herbal medicine. -Change the product so that it no longer has medicinal functions, and then sell it as food. -6.4.1.3 Finnish Categorisation CasesTo predict the outcome of the categorisation decision, we might want to look at how similar cases have previously been treated. The Finnish Agency of Medicines has an online record of classifi cation cases, classifi cation decisions resulting in verdict 'non-medicine' since the beginning of 1995 and decisions resulting in verdict 'medicine' since the beginning of 20011440. The category of 'non-medicines' in practice includes foods and cosmetics.The classifi cation is in each case based on:the information given to the Agency by the applicant of the classifi cation decision, -the information given in product marketing, and -scientifi c literature on the effects of product ingredients. - 1441Again, the two important elements of the classifi cation decision appear. These are product functions and the marketing claims.In 2006 (published by 11 December 2006), there were 16 classifi cations as medicines, and 13 as non-medicines.The non-medicines were:tiger balsam for sore shoulders, containing menthol, mint, eucalyptus etc. -antiseptic mouth wash -sport nutrition (recovery and fat-free muscle building) -various food supplements containing vitamins (A,B,C,D,E), minerals, fi sh oils and -omega three fatty acidsAloe Vera extract and vitamin C, food supplement -salt for horses, for constipation -clam etc. for dogs' joints -Psyllium Ispaghula bark powder for horses, for problems related to eating sand. -Of these, only Aloe Vera and Psyllium Ispaghula were plant-based products.If medicinal marketing claims, i.e. a therapeutic indication, had appeared on the Aloe Vera label, it would no doubt have been considered a medicine. Aloe Vera (in Finnish, medicinal Aloe) is on the Pharmacopoeia Annex 2 list on herbals that can be 1440 They have also a third category, which covers health care appliances and devices.1441 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.laakelaitos.fi /laaketeollisuus/luokittelu/luokittelupaatoksia/index.html.-263-regarded as medicines. Apparently, the medicinal function was in this case not strong enough for the product to be regarded as a medicine.Psyllium Ispaghula is used for stomach troubles because of its fi bre content1442. The plant is not listed in the pharmacopoeia, and has no pharmacological effect and therefore it is regarded as food, not medicine.The medicines in 2006 were:Melon extract etc. for vitiligo - 1443Glucosaminesulfate for joints -Benzoyleperokside for acne -Antibacterial mouth wash -Spirulina platensis - (algae) for malnutrition and lack of nutrientsCitrus aurantium - , green tee extract, guarana extract etc. for weight management'Amino acid enzymes', hawthorn berry extract, vitamins etc. for digestion (two products) -Colostrum - 1444, Echinacea purpurea, eucalyptus, menthol and vitamins for sore throatCranberry extract for urinary tract infections - 1445Saw palmetto ( - Sabal serrulata) 1446 extract, nettle1447 extract, lycopene for prostate problems and impotence1448Boswellia - 1449 extract etc. for arthrosis1450Vaccinium myrtillus - (blueberry) and Tagetes erecta1451 etc. for night vision and eye diseases1452Soy, vitamins etc. for eye health - 1453Symphtytum offi cinalis - (blackwort)1454 extract etc. for joints, muscles, bruises, cuts etc.Annona muricata - 1455 powder for health enhancement and immunity.1442 \"Psyllium is a soluble fi bre used primarily as a gentle bulk-forming laxative. It comes from a shrub-like herb called plantain that grows worldwide.\" Atlanta Journal-Constitution web page at: http://www.ajc.com/health/altmed/shared/health/alt_medicine/ConsSupplements/Psylliumcs.html.1443 Also known as leukoderma, in Finnish: valkopalvi.1444 In Finnish: ternimaito.

Raintree Nutrition company web page at: http://www.rain-tree.com/graviola.htm.-264-In this list, there are several plant-based products. In 2006 the Agency had not specifi ed whether the classifi cation was based on medicinal claims or product function. It is clear that almost all of the above-listed products would have been classifi ed as medicines just because of the claim used. If a product is marketed for prevention or treatment of a disease, it is always considered a medicinal product. One cannot claim, for example, \"for vitiligo\" or \"for arthrosis\" if one wants to sell the product as food.Some of the above could also have been classifi ed as medicinal products by function, even without medicinal marketing claims. For example Echinacea, Symphytum offi cinalis and Sabal serrulata are well-known medicinal plants that are listed in the pharmacopoeias. Products containing these plants are classifi ed as medicines, if they are present in quantities that have a pharmacological effect on the body.Cranberry and blueberry of the berries in the above list are not listed in the pharmacopoeia, even though they do have scientifi cally proven health functions. Hawthorn, on the other hand, is listed in the pharmacopoeia. We will return to the three chosen berries (hawthorn, emblic leaffl ower, and barbary wolfberry) in the next chapter.The non-medicines of the year 2005, consist of, for example:pastille containing 17 % Aloe Vera juice -artichoke ginseng tea, 99 % artichoke, 1 % ginseng -herbal tea containing: 90 % Mulberry, 10 % - Chrysanthemum fl owerrefreshing drink containing - Angelica archangelica1456 leaf extractmuscle relaxing massage cream containing - Angelica archangelica etc.food supplement containing: - Kaempferia pafi fl ora 75 mg, Butea superba 50 mg, Zingiber offi cinale 50 mg, Anamitra Cocculus W & A-leaf 25 mg, Nelumbo nucifera Gaertner-leaf 25 mg, Piper nigrum, linnseed 25 mgherbal tea containing: - Polygonum multifl orum 15 %, Tinaspora sinensis mer 50 %, Piper lolot C 10 %, Glychyrrhiza uralensis 5 %, Cortex acantho panasis 10 %, Rhizoma imperatae 10 %.The refreshing drink product contained Angelica archangelica 1.09mg/l. The massage cream contained Angelica archangelica 0.6 %. Angelica archangelica is a commonly known medicinal plant, and the decisions to categorise these two products as foods were based on the low quantities of the medicinal plant.The non-medicines from 1995 to the end of June 2004 consist of:Aloe Vera use (1996) -Ecoway Noni (2001) -Ginseng Tea (Special) (2003) -Guarana brasil (1996) -Maui Noni (1 tablet every 3rd day) (2004) -Green Echinacea tea (2003) -This information from before 2005 is not very useful as the compositions of the products are not given and it is not explained why the product was classifi ed as a non-medicine.1456 In Finnish: vainonputki.-265-Medicines from 2001 to 20051457 consist of, for example:Ginseng tablet, containing ginsenosides 8.3 mg/tablet -Ginseng extract, corresponding to 340mg ginseng root/tablet -Ginseng root 100mg -Ginseng extract 100mg, ginsenosides 24mg/tablet -Ginseng extract 100mg, 80mg ginsenosides -Ginseng radix 70% -Ginseng (ginsenosides 8mg) -Echinacea radix - 400mgEchinacea - extract 33.6% (168.7mg /tablet)Silybum marianum - (milk thistle, holy thistle)1458 extractCordyseps sinensis - (Cordyseps mushroom, caterpillar fungus)1459 75%Cordyseps sinensis - 1000mg.

All of the above were categorised as medicines based on their function. If a product is categorised as a medicine by function, it means the product has physiological or pharmacological effects on the body. In these cases this was due to the presence 1457 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.laakelaitos.fi /uploads/Laaketeollisuus/luokittelu/laakkeet2001-2005.pdf.1458 In Finnish: maarianohdake.

The Agency must base their decision on scientifi c facts, particularly on the effective doses of each plant.In 2001 - 2005 there were numerous products categorised as medicines based on the marketing claim. These were products marketed for menopause and female hormonal changes, impotence and male performance, psoriasis, urinary tract infections and prevention of kidney stones, impotence, and depression or anxiety, for example. In these cases, the Agency did not even have to look at the function of the product, as the claims were medicinal. The Agency probably considered these as relatively simple cases.When investigating the above lists of categorisation decisions, we must keep in mind that legislation changed in November 2005. That is when the implementation legislation of directive 2004/24/EC came into force in Finland. This directive included a change in the defi nition of a medicinal product, and created the new category of traditional herbal medicinal products. Based on the Finnish legislation1468 implementing directives 2004/24 and 2004/27, the new legislation in fact shifted the borderline between medicines and foods, so that former foods may now be considered medicinal products. This can be inferred from the transitional regulations:If a product has received product authorisation according to old legislation, and the -product corresponds to the defi nition of traditional herbal medicinal product according to new legislation, the National Agency of Medicines will change the product license into product registration, when renewed.If a product has received product authorisation according to old legislation, and does -not correspond to the defi nition of traditional herbal medicinal product according to new legislation, product authorisation according to new legislation must be applied for, when renewed.If a product has been classifi ed as a foodstuff according to old legislation, and the -product corresponds to the defi nition of traditional herbal medicinal product according to new legislation, registration as a traditional herbal medicinal product must be applied for by the end of 2007.Here we see that 'traditional herbal medicinal product' is by Finnish legislators seen as a legal category consisting of both former medicines and of former foods. This means that some of the products previously categorised as foodstuffs could now be regarded as medicines.The change in the defi nition of medicinal product in the Finnish law of November 2005 corresponds to the change of the directive 2004/24/EC. In the new defi nition1469, the medicinal action is more precisely defi ned as \"pharmacological, immunological and metabolic action\". This clarifi cation as such does not shift the borderline between foodstuffs and medicines, and the Finnish lawmakers agree on this.How is it then possible that some of the products previously classifi ed as foods might according to the new legislation be classifi ed as traditional herbal medicinal products? This outcome must be based on the notion that according to new legislation, unclear cases are to be 1468 Laki laakelain muuttamisesta. 4.11.2005/853.1469 Finnish Medicines Act section 3.-267-categorised as medicines. The Finnish law now includes the same rule1470 as the directive1471: unclear cases are to be treated as medicines, in cases where a product corresponds to the defi nition of a medicinal product and also the defi nition of some other product (for example food but also medical devices and cosmetics).Before the selection rule existed, unclear cases were apparently sometimes treated as foods, sometimes medicines. We might presume that all EU Member States have understood the new rule in a similar manner, and that the borderline has in fact somewhat shifted towards medicines. This means we cannot rely on any 'non-medicine' categorisation decisions by any EU Member States from before 2005 for comparison to our products.6.4.1.4 Probable Categorisation of the Three BerriesHawthorn is used as herbal medicine in Europe. In Western herbalism, hawthorn fruit, leaf, and fl ower have all had a long history of use for treating cardiac weakness, and this has become a focus of modern research.1472 For example, in the Finnish Pharmacopoeia, hawthorn (Crataegus) is listed in Annex 2: herbals that could be considered as medicines. This does not mean that products made of hawthorn are automatically regarded as medicinal products. Instead, it means that products containing hawthorn in quantities that have pharmacological effects on the body, are considered as herbal medicines.At the moment (end of 2006), there are two authorised herbals based on hawthorn on the Finnish market: both in the form of tincture and both used for mild heart conditions. It has to be noted, that these products have been authorised under the old law on herbal medicines. Both can be sold in the Finnish food stores1473. In the future, these products will have to be authorised as herbal medicinal products or registered as traditional herbal medicinal products according to the new legislation.Emblic leaffl ower and barbary wolfberry are not listed in the European Pharmacopoeias."
