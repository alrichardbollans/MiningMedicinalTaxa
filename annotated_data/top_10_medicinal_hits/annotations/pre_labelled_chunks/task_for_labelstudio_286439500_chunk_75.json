All. have been used in traditional medicinefor different conditions related to the spasm of the gastrointestinal system. However,there have been no experimental studies to support the smooth muscle relaxant effectof this plant. The aim of our research was to assess the effects of the hydroethanolicextract of Roman chamomile, its fractions, four of its flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin,hispidulin, and eupafolin), and its essential oil on smooth muscles. The phytochemicalcompositions of the extract and its fractions were characterized and quantified byHPLC-DAD, the essential oil was characterized by GC and GC-MS. Neuronally mediatedand smooth muscle effects were tested in isolated organ bath experiments on guineapig, rat, and human smooth muscle preparations. The crude herbal extract induced animmediate, moderate, and transient contraction of guinea pig ileum via the activationof cholinergic neurons of the gut wall. Purinoceptor and serotonin receptor antagonistsdid not influence this effect. The more sustained relaxant effect of the extract, measuredafter pre-contraction of the preparations, was remarkable and was not affected by anadrenergic beta receptor antagonist. The smooth muscle-relaxant activity was found tobe associated with the flavonoid content of the fractions. The essential oil showed onlythe relaxant effect, but no contracting activity. The smooth muscle-relaxant effect wasalso detected on rat gastrointestinal tissues, as well as on strip preparations of humansmall intestine. These results suggest that Roman chamomile extract has a direct andprolonged smooth muscle-relaxant effect on guinea pig ileum which is related to itsflavonoid content. In some preparations, a transient stimulation of enteric cholinergicmotoneurons was also detected. The essential oil also had a remarkable smooth musclerelaxant effect in this setting. Similar relaxant effects were also detected on other visceralpreparations, including human jejunum. This is the first report on the activity of Romanchamomile on smooth muscles that may reassure the rationale of the traditional use ofthis plant in spasmodic gastrointestinal disorders.Keywords: Roman chamomile, Chamaemelum nobile, Asteraceae, organ bath experiment, gastrointestinalpreparations, spasmolytic effect, contractile actionFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 323193fphar-09-00323 April 4, 2018 Time: 18:30 # 2Sandor et al. Spasmolytic Effect of Roman ChamomileINTRODUCTIONChamaemelum nobile (L.) All. (Asteraceae), widely knownas Roman chamomile, is a perennial herb native to South-Western Europe, but it is cultivated as a medicinal plantall over Europe and in Africa as well. Dried flowers of thecultivated, double-flowered variety of the species are official inthe European Pharmacopoeia (European Pharmacopoeia, 2008).Incorporating the plant in traditional herbal medicinal productshas been acknowledged by the European Medicines Agency. Thecomminuted herbal substance (as tea) and a liquid extract ofthe plant (extraction solvent: ethanol 70% v/v) may be used forthe symptomatic treatment of mild, spasmodic gastrointestinalcomplaints including bloating and flatulence. The British HerbalPharmacopoeia indicates its use as carminative, anti-emetic,antispasmodic, and sedative (British Herbal Pharmacopoeia,1971).Roman chamomile (RC) has been used as a medicinal plantfrom the middle ages. The cultivation of the plant started inEngland in the 16th century (Hiller and Melzig, 1999). Thedouble variety of the flower, which now serves as the maincommercial drug, has certainly been known since the 18thcentury (Evans, 1989). The plant gained the name \"nobile\"(Latin, noble) to illustrate its superior therapeutic efficacy overMatricaria recutita L. (German chamomile) (Hiller and Melzig,1999). The plant was first listed in the Pharmacopoeia ofWurttemberg (1741) as a carminative, painkiller, diuretic, anddigestive aid (Lukacs, 1990). In the folk medicine of differentregions of Europe, RC has been used for numerous conditions,including dyspepsia, flatulence, nausea and vomiting, anorexia,vomiting of pregnancy, dysmenorrhoea, and specifically forgastrointestinal cramps and flatulent dyspepsia associated withmental stress (Augustin et al., 1948; Rapoti and Romvary, 1974;Melegari et al., 1988; Rossi et al., 1988; Bradley, 1992). Inthe Mediterranean region, RC tea is consumed to improveappetite and also after meal to prevent indigestion (Rivera andObon, 1995; Menendez-Baceta et al., 2014; Alarcun et al., 2015).Traditional use of RC is largely related to its supposed smoothmuscle-relaxant activity.The majority of the secondary metabolites described from theplant belong to the aliphatic esters (essential oil) (Fauconnieret al., 1996), sesquiterpene lactones (Bisset, 1994) and flavonoids(Herisset et al., 1971, 1973; Abou-Zied and Rizk, 1973; Piettaet al., 1991). The polysaccharide content of the dried floweris noteworthy, 3.9% (Lukacs, 1990). The supposed smoothmuscle-relaxant activity of the plant might be attributed to itsflavonoid content. Apigenin and luteolin possess remarkablesmooth muscle relaxant effects on guinea pig ileum (Lemmens-Gruber et al., 2006).Although several studies on the bioactivities of RC areavailable, the majority of these studies were carried out usingthe essential oil, which is not used medicinally, or the observedactivities are not related to the traditional use of the plant. Severalstudies demonstrate the antimicrobial effects of RC essential oilagainst different bacterial and fungal strains (Hansel et al., 1993;Piccaglia et al., 1993; Chao et al., 2000; Bail et al., 2009), andantifungal activity was demonstrated also for the aqueous extractsof RC (Magro et al., 2006). The anti-inflammatory capacity andheat shock protein modulating effects of the flavonoids apigeninand quercetin, as well as the anti-inflammatory activities ofa-bisabolol, guajazulene, and chamazulene have been reportedin preclinical studies (Viola et al., 1995; Baghalian et al., 2008,2011; Hernandez-Ceruelos et al., 2010). The polysaccharides ofRC exerted antiphlogistic effect in vivo (Lukacs, 1990).Although the use of RC extract for gastrointestinal problemsseems to be related to its presumptive smooth muscle-relaxanteffect, interestingly no in vitro or in vivo studies have beencarried out so far to assess this bioactivity."
