Also, obtained values in this study were consistent with the available manufacturer data. Analyz-ing surface water samples for caffeine, significant concen-trations were found at the sampling sites near the waste-water discharges. Mean caffeine concentrations for sum-mer, fall, winter and spring periods were 24.78 ng/L, 26.83 ng/L, 24.61 ng/L, and 86.29 ng/L, respectively. The high-est mean caffeine concentration was detected in samples collected in the spring period which is in an agreement with the literature (Fernandez et al., 2010). The caffeine content in combined non-narcotic analgoantipiretics varied from (96.48-100.74)% of the declared value. The require-ments of the British Pharmacopoeia include (95-105)% of active drug content. According to obtained data it can be concluded that all brands did meet this specification in the HPLC assay method.ConclusionIn this work a unique and simple to perform HPLC method was established for caffeine content determina-tion in food, beverages, surface water and analgoantipiret-ics. Obtained data for accuracy, repeatability, selectivity and robustness confirmed that the proposed method could be used for routine control of caffeine content in differ-ent mixtures. The results of food and beverages analysis showed that caffeine content was consistent with the avail-able manufacturer data and obtained data for combined commercial formulations of non-narcotic analgoantipiret-ics of all brands did meet specification of the British Phar-macopoeia for active drug content. Testing the surface wa-ter samples for caffeine showed that significant concentra-tions were found at the sampling sites near the wastewater discharges. The potential risk for chronic effects may occur in resident organisms in the long-term period so an appro-priate treatment of wastewater would be essential in pre-vention of the potential pollution.ReferencesFernandez, C., Gonzales-Doncel, M., Pro, J.,Carbonell, G.,Tarazona, J.V., 2010.

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that ex-ists in eight different forms, among them, a-tocopherol is the most active form in humans. Vitamin E is very popular cosmetic ingredient. It acts as antioxidant to protect cells against free radicals and reduces oxidative stress. Ultravio-let light and environmental pollutants are known initiators of free radicals and skin damage. Topical antioxidants have the potential to diminish the reactive oxygen species gen-erated from the UVA radiation. For that reason, there is an increasing interest in the incorporation of vitamins and an-tioxidants in skin care products (Lupo, 2001).The stability of the vitamin E in the cosmetic formu-lations and when applied to the skin is low. When exposed to UV light, it forms a-tocopheroxyl radicals that consume other antioxidants for recycling. For better stability, vita-min E is commonly used as a biologically non-active ester-ified form, such as tocopheryl acetate (Shapiro and Saliou, 2001). Vitamin E esters act as a pro-drug since they are hy-drolyzed to the active vitamin E (a-tocopherol) upon pen-etration into skin. However, there is conflicting evidence as to what extent this conversion actually takes place in the skin and many studies have shown that these substi-tutes have very low biological activity. While numerous topical skin care products claim to contain ''vitamin E'', these products may actually contain very different concen-trations and forms including active vitamin E, its several esters and many other derivatives (Thiele and Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage, 2007).The solid and emulsified cosmetic products must be carefully prepared for any of instrumental techniques which would be employed in the tocopherol analysis. The aim of this study was to develop an effective solid-phase extraction procedure for the HPLC determination of a-tocopheryl acetate, which could be important for assess-ment the content of this synthetic form of vitamin E in sun-screen lotions and creams. Materials and methodsMaterialsMethanol, ethanol and acetonitrile used in this work were of HPLC grade (J.T.Baker). a-tocopheryl acetate (TA) of analytical grade was obtained from Fluka (Fluka-Analytical BioChemika). Stock solution of 1.03 mg/mL was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amounts of the a-tocopheryl acetate in absolute ethanol. Two sets of cali-bration standards were prepared by diluting aliquots of the stock solution.Cosmetic productsCommercial sunscreen products were purchased from a local cosmetic shop. Formulations under study were Pro-ducer 1-Sun Lotion SPF 30 and Producer 2-Sunscreen cream SPF 50. According to the product label, both formu-lations contained vitamin E only in the form of tocopheryl acetate and TA content was not exactly declared.Sample preparationA 0.5 g of the formulation was measured in 20 ml plas-tic volumetric container and 0.5 mL of 0.5% ascorbic acid was added. The emulsion was dissolved by vortex-mixing with 5 mL of ethanol. After centrifugation for 10 min, a 3 mL of the supernatant was pipetted and applied to the SPE column.SPE conditionsSolid phase extraction was performed on Chromabond C18ec cartridges (1ml/100mg, Macherey-Nagel, GmbH, Duren, Germany), which was previously selected among S2 PP 62142Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 141 - 142 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsfive cartridges with different sorbent type. Cartridges were conditioned with 1mL of deionized water, followed by 1mL of methanol and 1mL of acetonitrile. After the sam-ple was aspirated through the cartridge, analyte elution was made by 2 x 1 mL of methanol.HPLC conditionsThe Agilent Technologies 1200 Series apparatus with DAD and FL detection was used for the analysis. Sepa-ration was performed on the Restek Ultra IBD C18 col-umn (150 mm x 3 mm, 3 mm). UV detector was set at 220 nm and 295 nm. Based on our previous work, 100% ace-tonitrile was selected as the optimal mobile phase (Sunaric et al., 2012). The column temperature was maintained at 40degC and the flow rate was kept at 0.45 ml/min.Results and discussionTocopheryl acetate in extracted samples of the sun-screen formulations was identified by comparing the re-tention time of the observed chromatographic peak with that of the standard. Recovery of the solid-phase extrac-tion method was calculated by comparison of the TA peak area for extracted and non-extracted standard TA solution on five different cartridges. The obtained recovery value was higher than 85% for Chromabond C18ec, therefore this cartridge was selected for further analysis. Addition-ally, the cartridge selection was confirmed by extraction of the real samples supernatants obtained in sample prepa-ration procedure for the examined cosmetics. Even in this case, the highest chromatographic peak area of TA was ob-tained on Chromabond C18ec cartridge. The calibration curves for two concentration ranges, 0.2 mg/mL - 2.0 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL - 1.0 mg/mL with the correlation coefficients > 0.998 were constructed and applied for the determination of TA in the injected samples. Final tocopheryl acetate content found in the examined formulations was as follows: (200+-15) mg/100g (0.2%) in Producer 1-Sun Lotion SPF 30 and (490+-20) mg/100g (0.49%) in Producer 2-sunscreen cream SPF 50. These re-sults are in agreement with those given by other authors, that TA content is from 0.1% to 1% (Shapiro and Saliou, 2001; Thiele and Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage, 2007). As was expected, much higher content of TA was found in the formulation with a higher SPF level.ConclusionCosmetic formulations contain a high number of in-gredients and the analysis often requires extensive pre-treatments. A SPE method followed by HPLC determina-tion has been developed for the analysis of tocopheryl ace-tate in cosmetics. For the present experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the proposed extraction method was appropriate for the determination of TA in sunscreen lotion and cream. The extraction procedure was efficient, showing good accuracy and precision. Proposed analytical procedure for TA determination can be useful tool to know the amount of this synthetic form of vitamin E in cosmet-ic products.

D, Blvd. Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* szlatanovic@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionNon-sterile drugs must satisfy the appropriate microbi-ological purity criteria which are included in monographs in pharmacopoeias. Pharmacopoeial studies are prepared specifically to ensure that the medicinal product is thera-peutically effective and safe for the patient.Caffetin Cold is a combined medicinal product, con-taining several active ingredients: paracetamol (500 mg), pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (30 mg), dextrometho-rphan hydrobromide (15 mg) and ascorbic acid (60 mg). Paracetamol is a pain reliever and reduces body tempera-ture. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride decreases nasal con-gestion, allowing nasal and respiratory passages to open up. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide suppress cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation. Ascorbic acid (Vi-tamin C) fortifies the immune system (www.alkaloid.com.mk/vademecum-step-2.nspx?LekTipId=64). The importance of determination of microbiological purity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in solid forms comes from the fact that the final product must com-ply with the criteria for microbiological purity.Objective: Validation of analytical method for deter-mination of microbiological purity of paracetamol, pseu-doephedrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobro-mide and ascorbic acid in the composition of Caffetin cold tablets. This method further should be used for routine de-termination of microbiological purity of APIs in Caffetin cold tablets. The method should be simple for manipula-tion and in compliance with the current edition of Europe-an Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur., 2013).Materials and methodsMaterialsStandard laboratory equipment was used. Buffered so-dium chloride peptone solution pH 7.0 was used as medi-um for dissolving of the sample and for making the dilu-tions of the culture suspensions.Ready to use nutrient media from BioMerieux(r) (69280 Marcy-l'Etoile-France) 90 mm Petri dishes of Trypcase Soy agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar were used.Standard test microorganisms recommended by the current Ph.Eur. for the method suitability test: Escherichia Coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergil-lus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 were used for challenge test.MethodsSurface-spread method and determination of antimi-crobial activity of APIs in Caffetin cold tablets was used. The number of all test microorganisms applied in the chal-lenge tests was less than 100 cfu/ml. Each application was made in duplicate and the temperature and time of incu-bation depended of the type of the medium. Trypcase Soy agar was incubated for five days at a temperature from 30-35 @C, Sabouraud Dextrose agar was incubated for 7 days at a temperature from 20-25 @C. After the incubation time, the relation between the number of the each test microor-ganism dissolved in buffered sodium chloride pepton solu-tion pH 7.0, and the number of that test microorganism in the presence of the product was calculated. When verifying the suitability of the plate-count meth-S2 PP 63144Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 143 - 144 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsod, a mean of any of the test organisms not differing by a factor greater than 2 must be obtained (Clontz, 2009; Ph.Eur. 2013; USP, 2014).Results and discussion Microbiological purity was determined with direct application on the nutrient medium with surface-spread method. Results for paracetamol (1:10) showed that acceptabil-ity factor is 0.93 when Escherichia coli was used, 1.35 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.97 for Staphylococcus aure-uss and 1.05 for Bacillus spizizenii. For Candida albicans the acceptability factor ranges from 0.93 to 1.07 and for Aspergillus brasiliensis from 1.06 to 1.13.Paracetamol does not have antimicrobial activity on the used test micro-organisms. Acceptability factor ranged within the compatibility framework and it never exceeded the value of 2.Results for pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (1:10) showed that there is no increase of colonies of Escherich-ia coli. Acceptability factor when Pseudomonas aerugino-sa was used is 29.33, for Staphylococcus aureus is 1.61, for Bacillus spizizenii is 6.00, for Candida albicans is 2.15 and for Aspergillus brasiliensis ranges from 1.30 to 2.93.Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride has an antimicrobial activity on the used test micro-organisms. Inactivation of antimicrobial activity of pseudoephed-rine hydrochloride was done using the dilution of 1:100 in buffered sodium chloride peptone solution pH 7.0."
