      "text": "The article treated rongoa purely from a pharmaceutical effectiveness standpoint, describing individual plants and their known application for particular conditions. Plants such as kawakawa (Piper excelsum), manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), and koromiko (Hebe salicifolia), for example, were among 31 those listed, the last being noted as a treatment for diarrhoea. There was no recognition in these pages of the wider spiritual context of rongoa Maori as a whole system of healing, which is much more complex than herbal medicines alone (Ahuriri-Driscoll, 2014). . The persistence of home remedies into the mid-20th century The home remedies and self-help therapies mentioned in the Colonists' Guide may sound quaint and outdated today, but many of them were still current until at least the early 1970s. My own memories stretch back to my early childhood in the 1950s when pharmacists stocked a wide range of components for making up home remedies. They could be purchased by members of the public in small quantities or made up in the pharmacy on request (Combes, 1981). Home remedies in widespread use at the time included Bonnington's Irish Moss cough mixture, different brands of indigestion tablets, California syrup of figs (a laxative), gripe water for babies, and the patent medicines brought round by the Rawleigh's man.6 Our local chemist made up his 'own brand' range of basic products in brown glass bottles, labelled with his credentials. Diarrhoea and vomiting (sometimes known euphemistically as 'summer sickness') were subject to a range of recommendations for home remedies that were supposed to 'settle the stomach' including grated apple, dry toast, a Rawleigh's product known as Pleasant Relief, flat lemonade, and even ice cream. Basic products and the patent medicines along with aspirin, beef tea, and bed rest were used as supportive care in the days before vaccinations were available for measles7, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. All children were expected to contract them at some stage and my siblings and I were no exception. Non-ingested products such as antiphlogistine for boils, hydrogen peroxide and antiseptic dyes for skin abrasions, thrush and tinea, salt water gargles for sore throats, and camomile lotion for bites and skin rashes were also common. From my own experience, the remedies used were largely limited to treating an illness or skin infection; it was not usual to take a product for prevention apart from patent medicine 'tonics' that were available. Vitamin C tablets appeared in our household for the first time during the mid-1960s as a protection from winter colds and bronchitis, and during the late 1960s large fizzy 6 Rawleighs: a Australasian company that sold patent medicines and cooking essences door to door. It still exists today though the method of sale and the range of products have changed, see https://www.rawleighs.com/ 7 The first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 (Bloch et al 1985), with the others following. 32 tablets containing 1000mg doses of Vitamin C became a remedy for hangovers after student parties among some of the young men I knew. Developments in medical care that offered more treatments with prescribed antibiotics, anti- fungals and anti-histamines beginning in the 1940s became more widely available during the 1950s (Gaynes, 2017). In the following couple of decades, the advent of mass production of pre- packaged medicines saw many of the home remedies become outdated or the substances needed to make them no longer readily available. Compounding by community pharmacists was less necessary except in specialised cases, and is now likely to be less than one percent of prescriptions according to Krochmal (2009). Moreover, pharmacists were reluctant to stock ingredients for which there was only minor demand and which had to be discarded before their expiry date (Louise Kennedy pharmacist, personal communication). 'Own brand' basics and ingredients for home remedies were gradually replaced by commercially produced products that could be bought off the shelf or ordered independently in an increasingly globalised market. These were sometimes simply older remedies in a new guise. Garlic, for example, which has been recognised as having medicinal properties since ancient times (Rivlin, 2001), no longer needs to be peeled, crushed and ingested in its raw state but can be bought in a pharmacy or health food store as a prepackaged concentrated and odourless extract known as Kyolic(r) (Balamash et al., 2012). So while the 'natural health' products on pharmacy and health store shelves may appear to be a new phenomenon, they would seem, rather, to be part of a long continuum of obtaining substances to treat illness or maintain health that is connected to the history of humanity from earliest times. The difference is that the physical substances formerly used in home remedies and self-care have been reimagined, repackaged and marketed in a way that resonates with the contemporary citizen and can be obtained over-the-counter in a convenient ready-made form. 33 Chapter 3: Methodology and methods Introduction The key focus of my research was to gain an insight into the perspectives of people who used supplements regularly. I wanted to find out why they first started to take supplements, how they decided what to take, and what kind of effects they reported on their health and wellbeing. I was also interested in their sources of information about supplements, how they chose where to buy them and what their general relationship was with the orthodox health system. In addition I was interested in investigating whether people who used supplements were influenced by social attitudes and discourses that were evident in popular and academic publications and how these related to contemporary and historical ideas and expectations of health, illness and wellbeing throughout the life course. When I started out on the study, I had thought that building a greater understanding of the reasons people chose to use supplements might give a greater insight into the criticism that supplement use attracts in orthodox health care and perhaps go some way to reconciling the disparate views between users and critics. As the study progressed, however, I discovered that it was more important to examine supplement use as a practice in its own right rather than attempting to compare it to or reconcile it with other views. Epistemological approach A fundamental consideration in qualitative research is the ontological and epistemological position of the researcher; that is, their beliefs about what it is possible to find, and how to go about finding it (Giacomini, 2010). The individual researcher's beliefs about the nature of reality shape his or her view of the world; they affect how they approach the topic, how they generate and analyse the data and how they view the topic within the broader social and political context (Giacomini, 2010; Green & Thorogood, 2009). Realist assumptions assume that facts are stable and independent of values, and that researchers can and must distance themselves from the data and take an objective stance (Green & Thorogood, 2009: 13). Constructionists on the other hand, consider that reality is shaped by human processes that influence how the material world is experienced and interpreted and that one person's reality will differ from another's. Extreme constructionists take the view that all reality is relative and depends entirely on how it is constructed by human processes (Green and Thorogood 2009). An individual researcher may sit anywhere along this spectrum from positivist assumptions that reality is fixed at the one end, to 34 extreme constructionist view that nothing has independent reality and everything is relative at the other end. This study started from a constructionist standpoint in which I took the view that while reality exists, human beliefs and attitudes have a major influence on how people perceive and engage with it. Moreover that each individual will construct these influences in different ways and that their beliefs will change over time according to new experiences that they have, and new ideas they come across, as well as their own stage in life (Tulloch & Lupton, 2003). People's constructions of the world are developed as the result of an interaction between their own private, cognitive processes and their exposure to the publicly shared discourses and social norms of the age they live in (Giacomini, 2010). My study aimed to understand more about the phenomenon of supplements and their use by investigating perspectives and subjective experiences of the individual participants by talking to them and so gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding from their point of view (Kelly, 2010; Liamputtong, 2013). As the study progressed, however, it became obvious that the role of the supplement products themselves needed to be included as an important part of the study. This led me to consider a post-humanist element in the overall approach so that these products could be given due consideration. Post-humanism or materialist thinking, encompasses a diverse range of ideas (Bennett, 2010, 2012; Braidotti, 2006; Coole & Frost, 2010; Law, 1999), but they are all consistent in contesting the binary opposition that sees matter as simply inert and passive until humans take an interest in it (MacLure, 2015: 96). This way of thinking disturbs the privileged position of human agency and the primary importance it accords to human \"language, discourse, culture and values\" (Coole & Frost, 2010: 3). It acknowledges that material factors are influential in what happens both in individual lives and more generally within society. Matter is seen as having agency of its own, and that it can be \"...active ... productive, unpredictable\" (Coole & Frost, 2010: 9). Bringing matter back into consideration does not mean excluding the human, but rather restoring materiality to its place and recognising that matter and discourse come together \"...in complex and shifting arrangements from which the world emerges\" (MacLure, 2015:96). To write about both the human and non-human in the context of this study, I have chosen to use the term 'actants'. Actants is a neutral term which simply describes the many and various elements that come together in a phenomenon and avoids the limitations of language that always categorises people and things as being essentially different in their capacities. An actant 35 can be any entity, whether human or non-human, that \"modifies a state of affairs by making a difference\" (Latour, 2005: 71); people, material things, discourses, practices, relationships, or concepts. Using materiality thinking to examine supplements and supplement practices made it possible to incorporate any actants which proved to be important in the study and allowed a greater range of insights than would have been possible by focusing on human discourse alone. Venturing into a post-humanist approach and combining it with the study's original constructionist intention created a number of tensions in bringing these potentially divergent approaches together. Nevertheless there were compelling reason for including both. Much of the data entailed participants' perceptions about what was natural, holistic and safe about supplement practices. I believed that constructionist analysis was the most fitting way to do justice to these data, which had been generated through talking to participants, and was the dominant mode of investigation throughout the study. On the other hand, I considered it equally important not to leave aside the unexpected demonstrations that had occurred during the interviews about the role that the material products played in their lives. This dual approach was a direct result of being confident enough to stay with one of the core strengths of qualitative research, that is, the researcher needs to remain open to being surprised by developments that come to light in the course of their investigation and not set them aside if they do not fit with prior intentions or assumptions (Green & Thorogood, 2009). A number of authors have listed criteria against which qualitative research should be measured, citing characteristics such as validity, reliability and transferability (Pope & Mays, 2006) or credibility, authenticity, dependability and confirmability (Liamputtong, 2013). Lists of desirable qualities, however, tend to raise more questions than they answer. These terms are \"quite loose and imprecise as far as criteria go...and are themselves subject to interpretation...and seem resistant to ever being translated into relatively stable and general standards\" (Smith, 1990: 185- 186). I found that a more helpful approach was Liamputtong's general comment that \"validity lies more in a subjective, human estimation of what it means to have done something well, to have made an effort that is worthy of trust and to have written it up convincingly\" (2013: 43) This was the guidance I attempted to follow in being clear about the evolving process that resulted in moving between a constructionist and a post-humanist approach in different parts of the thesis. 36 Reflexivity One measure of being trustworthy as a researcher working within a constructionist frame is to acknowledge that they do not sit outside the data as an authority who creates categories that interpret and explain the subjects of the research. Rather they need to consider how their own experience, context and broader world view may influence what is found (Green & Thorogood, 2009: 23; Liamputtong, 2013: 29-30; Potvin et al., 2010: 447). They need to reflect critically on the preconceptions and values that they bring to the topic and subject them to the same analysis that they use with the data (Green and Thorogood, 2009). Essentially the researcher needs to acknowledge that a completely objective and value-free stance is not possible, and that their findings from research will inevitably be coloured by their own views and experience. Malterud (2001:484) defines this as \"the knower's mirror: an attitude of attending to the context of knowledge construction, especially to the effect of the researcher, at every step of the research process.\" That means researchers need to examine how their own assumptions and background have influenced their choice of topic, their research methods, and the analyses, interpretations, and writing methods that contribute to the final result (Bourke, 2014; Moser, 2008; Wiederhold, 2015). Rather than this being a disadvantage, explicit acknowledgement of personal and intellectual preconceptions enhances rather than detracts from the credibility of the research findings as the different ways that each researcher approaches the same subject help to generate a more complex understanding of the phenomenon in question (Malterud, 2001). In the following paragraphs, I set out my reflections on my own prior experience and assumptions I brought into the research. As a mature student with a wide range of life experience over more than six decades, I believed that I came to the topic with the advantage of having witnessed many changes in social thinking that had come about over this time. I had lived through major changes in technology and communications, advances in treatment and prevention of health and disease, the globalisation of trade and dissemination of goods, and an increasing diversity of the New Zealand population through immigration. Another important difference from my early years had been the change over the last 60 years from beliefs that nature was there to be used by humans for their purposes and benefit, to the belief that the natural environment must be protected from exploitation and sustained for generations to come. These changes had brought new ideas, discourses, and practices that were widely different from the homogeneous society of my childhood in the 1950s and I believed they had all played some part in contemporary notions of health and illness and had an influence on the use of supplements. 37 On a personal front, I was also well aware that I had led a secure and relatively privileged life compared to many others. I had the advantage of a stable upbringing and had enjoyed access to a wide variety of educational and occupational experiences across a variety of fields. I had studied and worked in the humanities, then in health sciences information, and over the last several decades in public health and primary health care research. I was conscious of the fact that this experience would have inevitably influenced how I thought about supplements and their users, and that I would need to guard against a potential tendency on my part to privilege the accounts of people who were more like me, and perhaps to place less credibility on those reporting attitudes and behaviour in relation to supplement use that was beyond what I would be comfortable with. Yet I was also aware that participants whose views were framed by a different world view from mine (that is, without the same longstanding exposure to the academic and health world), would be the most likely to contribute new and unknown information that would enrich my study. Although I used supplements myself from time to time, particularly to ward off respiratory infections, it was not something I had given much thought to or felt strongly about before the piece of previous research which had aroused my interest. I also believed I had a relatively neutral position towards the orthodox health system, seeing its practitioners as necessary and valuable, particularly in acute care. At the outset of my study, I believed I had no fixed opinion either for or against supplement use and believed I had a good grasp of the main issues. Just how superficial this turned out to be became apparent as I progressed through the study and heard the diverse views of the participants. It was oddly reassuring, however, as it confirmed that the topic I had chosen was worthwhile investigating in depth. The contact with the participants, the settings in which we met, the data itself and the reading and theory I examined opened up a whole new range of ideas about supplements and insights about their place in people's lives and at a more complex level than I had considered previously. Jackson and Mazzei (2012:6) have remarked on the way a researcher's memory of the interviews and their interactions with the participants, their personal and professional knowledge and their \"shifty selves as researchers\", inevitably has an effect on the way they think. This very much reflected what happened to me during the course of the study where my own thinking evolved in unexpected directions as a result of my experiences in conducting the research and becoming immersed in the theory and data. I note in the following chapters the instances where this happened. 38 Methods I chose in-depth interviews as being the most suitable method of generating data for this study as they work well with an inductive approach when new and unknown information is being sought to fill a gap in knowledge about a topic (Pope & Mays, 2006; Rice & Ezzy, 1999). A key advantage of in-depth interviews is that they allow time for the perspective of one individual to be explored in detail, so producing new knowledge through the interaction between the interviewer and interviewee (Kvale 2007 cited in Liamputtong, 2013: 52). They also avoid a participant being interrupted or dominated by the ideas of another person as can sometimes happen in focus groups."
