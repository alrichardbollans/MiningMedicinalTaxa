      "text": "MakindeFaculty of Thai Traditional Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, ThailandShorea roxburghii (Dipterocarpaceae) is a deciduous medium to large-sized tree native to Southeast Asian countries of Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. The extract from the plant is used for treating dysentery, diarrhea and cholera [1,2]. S. roxburghii is rich in polyphenolic constituents mainly stilbenoids, oligostilbenoids and dihydroisocoumarins [3]. This study investigated the hypoglycemic effect of the methanol extract from Shorea roxburghii leaves (SRL) in high fat diet/high fructose (HFDHF) and streptozotocin (STZ) induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in rats as well as evaluating its ameliorative potentials in altered biochemical and hematological parameters in the treated rats. T2DM was induced in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats by feeding with HFDHF for 4 weeks and administering STZ (35 mg/kg, i.p.) Diabetic rats were given SRL extract at doses of 100 and 400 mg/kg for 30 days. The food and water intake were monitored on a daily basis, while the fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels and body weight were measured weekly. Biochemical and hematological parameters as well as histopathological studies of the pancreas were also evaluated. SRL significantly decreased FBG and improved the body weight, food and water intake of treated diabetic rats. Furthermore, biochemical such as serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, glycated hemoglobin, creatinine and low-density lipoprotein and hematological parameters including white blood and red blood cells parameters were markedly ameliorated by SRL. Histopathological analyses of the pancreas indicated reconstitution of b-cells architecture in SRL treated rats. The results from this study suggests that S. roxburghii have antidiabetic potentials and can be considered for the treatment of T2DM Highlights.

Biological validation of herbal drugs from Vietnamese ethnopharmacology.S. Adorisio1, I. Muscari2, T.T. Thuy3, D.V. Delfino21 Foligno Nursing School, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy2 Secion of Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy3 Institute of Chemistry, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), Hanoi, VietnamIn Vietnam, two types of traditional medicine (TM) are practiced: thuoc nam, medicine of the South, and tuoc bac, medicine of the North, both of which are largely based on herbal drugs used by different Vietnamese ethnic groups. The main problem of Vietnamese herbal pharmacology is the biological validation of the traditional uses of medicinal plants and pure compounds isolated from them. To this purpose, we have performed initial validation studies on four plants of Vietnamese medical tradition: Dacrycarpus imbricatus, Pinus dalatensis Ferre, Oldenlandia pinifolia and Ficus hirta.Dacrycarpus imbricatus (Blume) de Laub: Two monocyclic diterpenes were isolated and tested for their anti-proliferative activity on acute myeloid leukemia (OCI-AML) cells. The results showed that 1 had significantly anti-proliferative activity whereas 2 was weakly active.Pinus dalatensis Ferre is an endemic species in Vietnam that has never been investigated. Fifteen compounds were isolated from its wood and one diterpenoid, one flavonoid, and one stilbenoid had inhibitory effects on the growth of OCI-AML. Oldenlandia pinifolia. Thirteen compounds were isolated from the n-hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts of whole plants O. pinifolia. MTT assay resulted that the n-butanol extract and four isolated compounds inhibited the proliferation of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. These four tested compounds induced apoptosis and activated caspase-3, with isorhamnetin-3-O-b-rutinoside that showed the most potent activity.Ficus hirta. A new oleanane triterpene has been isolated from the n-hexane extract of Ficus hirta leaves (Moraceae).In conclusion, the contribution of Vietnamese TM in establishing improved medical standards via the biological validation of the traditional remedies Dacrycarpus imbricatus, Pinus dalatensis Ferre, Oldenlandia pinifolia and Ficus hirta has been analyzed. Specifically, several compounds isolated from different parts of the four medicinal plants were able to inhibit cell cycle progression and to increase apoptosis. Additional studies will clarify their mechanisms, toxicity and therapeutic importance.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 19120th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP079. Effect of Fusarubin, a naftoquinone isolated from the endophytic fungi of Cladosporium spp., on senescence of acute myeloid leukemia cells.S. Adorisio1, I. Muscari2, A. Mazid3, D.V. Delfino1,21 Foligno Nursing School, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy2 Secion of Pharmacology, Department of Medicine, University of Perugia, Italy3 BCSIR Laboratories Dhaka, Dr. Qudrat-I-Khuda Road, Dhanmondi, BangladeshEndophytic fungi interact with host plants and alter aspects of their physiology, conferring increased tolerance to stress, improving immune system function, bolstering defenses against disease, and aiding substance absorption. Thus, the possibility of exploiting endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents has received increasing attention. Cladosporium species are endophytic fungi that grow on organic matter and are considered food contaminants and the anti-microbial and anti-tumor naphthoquinones fusarubin (FUS) and anhydrofusarubin (AFU) were isolated from a Cladosporium species residing inside Rauwolfia leaves. These compounds are not used in the ethnopharmacology but they can affect the action of ethnopharmacological plants such as Rauwolfia. The impact of FUS and AFU on cell growth was assessed in acute myeloid leukemia (OCI-AML3) and other hematologic tumor cell lines (HL-60, U937, and Jurkat). Treatment with FUS or AFU reduced the number of OCI-AML3 cells as evaluated by hemocytometer. Flow cytometry analyses showed that this effect was accompained by diverse impairments in cell cycle progression. Specifically, FUS significantly decreased the percentage of cells in S and increase the percentage of cells in G2/M phases, whereas AFU increased the percentage of cells in G0/G1 phase and decreased the percentage of of cells in S and G2/M phases. Both substances significantly increased apoptosis at higher concentrations. FUS, that was more potent than AFU, up-regulated p21 expression in a p53-dependent manner, as detected by Western blot analyses, likely the consequence of decreased ERK phosphorylation, increased p38 expression (both of which increase p21 stability) and decreased Akt phosphorylation. The up-regulation of p21 was possibly a mark of senescence since it was not accompained by and increase of caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. However, FUS was also able to induce apoptosis in 8% of cells by the production of Fas ligand, thus promoting caspase-8/3-dependent apoptosis. These results suggest that FUS induces a differential effect on the same cell line: senescence on the large majority of cells or apoptosis on a small fraction of them.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org19220th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP080. Exploring bioactive components in different parts of acer truncatum for sustainable development.R. Gu1,2, E. Kennelly1,3, C. Long1,21 College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Minzu University of China, Beiijng, China2 Key Laboratory of Ethnomedicine, Minzu University of China, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China3 Department of Biological Sciences, Lehman College, City University of New York, United StatesAcer truncatum (Sapindaceae) has been used as an ethnomedicine by the Mongolian for a long history. Traditionally its leaves have been consumed as a substitute for tea in northern China. Previous phytochemical research has focused on the leaf (AL) due to its long history as a tea for healthcare. The oil from Acer truncatum seeds (ATO) is rich in unsaturated fatty acids, especially in nervonic acid (NA). Its branch (ABr), bark (ABa), fruit (AF), root (AR), or seed residue extracts (ASR), however, have not been paid attention. Principal component analysis showed the close clustering of ABr, ABa, and AR, indicating that they share similar chemical components, while AL and AF clustered more distantly. Using UPLC-QTOF-MS analysis, 15 compounds were putatively identified from ASRs, including N-acetyl-D-tryptophan, nonanedioic acid, 10E-heptadecenoic acid, pregnanolone, phosphatidylglycerol (34:2), and phosphatidylinositol (34:1), which have not been reported in Acer prior to this study. The flavonoids miscanthoside and isovitexin/vitexine were also identified in A. truncatum for the first time. Furthermore, five samples each of ATO and ASR were selected to estimate the cytotoxic activities against four human tumor cell lines (A-549, SMMC-7721, MCF-7, and SW-480) and the AChE inhibitory activity. All ASRs were cytotoxic on all tested cells and exhibited higher inhibitory activity than ATOs at 100 mg/mL. ASRs exhibited stronger cytotoxicity on SMMC-7721. Similarity, the ASRs exhibited higher AChE inhibitory activity than the ATOs. All ASRs significantly inhibited AChE activity, and the inhibition rates were close to 90% at 20 mg/mL. Our results indicate ASRs were rich in bioactive components with cytotoxic and AChE inhibitory activities. These findings suggest that ATO and ASR could be a promising resource in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical fields, which will support the sustainable uses of Acer truncatum.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 19320th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP081. Cytotoxicity of selected medicinal plant species used by traditional healers in treating people living with HIV/AIDS in Uganda.G. Anywar1,4,5, E. Kakudidi1, R. Byamukama2, J. Mukonzo3, H. Oryem-Origa1, A. Schubert4, C. Jassoy51 Department of Plant Sciences, Microbiology & Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala2 Department of Chemistry, Makerere University, College of Natural Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala 3Department of Pharmacology & Therapeutics, College of Health Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala 4 Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy & Immunology (IZI), Leipzig, Germany5 Institute for Virology, University Clinics & Faculty of Medicine, University of Leipzig, GermanyMany people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in Uganda widely use herbal medicines. This is fueled by the belief in their therapeutic benefits and the fact that fewer PLHIV in Uganda have access to antiretroviral drugs than those eligible. However, the toxicity and safety of the medicinal plants used have not been investigated, posing a threat to patients' health. The objective of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity of medicinal plant species commonly used for HIV treatment in Uganda.The cytotoxicity of the plant extracts was determined using the AlamarBlue cell viability assay with the human glioblastoma cell line: U87.CD4.CXCR4. The cells were treated with varying concentrations of the ethanol and Dimethyl Sulphoxide (DMSO) extracts of Warbrugia ugandensis Sprague, Erythrina abyssinica DC., Cryptolepsis sanguinolenta (Lindl.) Schltr., Albizia coriaria Oliv, Psorospermum febrifugium Spach, Gymnosporia senegalensis (Lam.) Loes., Zanthoxylum chalybeum Engl., Securidaca longipendunculata Fresen., Acacia hockii De Wild., Gardenia ternifolia Subsp. jovis-tonantis (Welw.) Verdc. and Bridelia micrantha (Hochst.) Baill. In addition, the half maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of the plant extracts was determined. Both the ethanol and DMSO extracts of W. ugandensis and A. coriria were highly cytotoxic with CC50 values of 7.6 and 1.5 ug/ml and 6.4 and < 4 ug/ml respectively. Most of the plant extracts (15/22) tested were moderately cytotoxic (CC50 = 21-200 ug/ml). The ethanol extracts of the plant species tested were generally less toxic to the cells than the DMSO extracts suggesting that a significant fraction of toxic substances are non-polar. The DMSO extracts of the plant species tested were generally more cytotoxic to the cells than the ethanol extracts. Some of the medicinal plant species such as C. sanguinolenta, P. febrifugium and S. longipendunculata had high CC50 values with correspondingly low cytotoxicity levels.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org19420th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP082. Chemical and biological investigation on Calluna vulgaris (l.) Hull. Grown in Italy for its use as innovative skin-protective agent.G. Baini1, G. Cappellucci1, M. Corsini2, E. Miraldi1, E.S. Pistone1, A.R. Magnano1, M. Biagi11 Department of Physical Sciences, Earth and Environment, University of Siena, Italy2 Department of Biotechnology, Chemistry and Pharmacy - Department of Excellence 2018-2022; University of Siena, ItalyCalluna vulgaris (L.) Hull. (Ericaceae) is a perennial shrub common in many European countries, from mountainous to flat areas. In ethnobotany, C. vulgaris aerial parts decoction has been used for urinary complaints. More recently, photo-protective activity was also investigated. In order to better define the role of this medicinal plant in the modern phytotherapy, we focused our attention on chemical and biological characteristics of the few studied Italian C. vulgaris. First, we chemically characterized different extracts of C. vulgaris collected in different periods and areas of Italy. Then, we studied a standardized water extract evaluating red/ox properties, antiradical capacity, antimicrobial activity and the effectiveness in modulating collagen synthesis in human fibroblasts.Italian C. vulgaris aerial parts were found to mainly contain polysaccharides and polyphenols; arbutin was also detected. C. vulgaris samples collected in Tuscany, Piedmont and South Tyrol were found to have a similar quali-quantitative phytochemical profile; the flowering stage was confirmed to be the \"balsamic\" period. Water extracts were found to be rich in all chemical markers, being the richest in polysaccharides and arbutin and having a good content in polyphenols. We prepared a standardized water dried extract of C. vulgaris collected in Tuscany (CVE): >10% polysaccharides, >4% total flavan-3-ols, >0.5% chlorogenic acid, >0.5% flavonoids (as hyperoside) and >0.05% arbutin.In DPPH test, IC50 of CVE was below 50 ug/ml; oxidative processes at low potential (<+0.50) were detected by cyclic voltammetry measurements. CVE exerted a moderate antimicrobial effectiveness against Streptococcus pyogenes. In fibroblasts, CVE stimulated pro-collagen I synthesis at very low concentrations.Due to the abundance of antioxidant constituents such as polyphenols and arbutin and of hydrophilic polysaccharides and given the activity on human fibroblasts, C. vulgaris growing in Italy possesses several positive features to be better investigated as innovative agent for skin anti-aging and protection.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 19520th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP083."
