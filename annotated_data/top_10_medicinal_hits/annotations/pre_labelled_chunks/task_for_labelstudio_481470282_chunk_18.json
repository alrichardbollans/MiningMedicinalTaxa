Flavonoids and phenolic acids from the aerial parts of Alyssum alyssoides.O. St. Tsiftsoglou1, K. Anagnou, M. Stefanakis2, E. Kokkalou1, D. M. Lazari1 1 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Greece2 University of Crete, Department of Chemistry, Laboratory of Organic Chemistry, Heraklion, GreeceMost of Alyssum species of Brassicaceae family have been mainly studied for their contribution in ecology. In this study, A. alyssoides was examined for its chemical substitutes. The methanol extract of its aerial parts was fractionated with liquid-liquid extraction (distribution) with four different solvents of increasing polarity: diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, 1-butanol and water. The diethyl ether and ethyl acetate extracts were further studied for their chemical composition. So far, secondary metabolites which belong to phenolics were isolated by using several chromatographic methods (C.C. and HPLC) and wereidentified by using spectroscopic methods (UV/Vis, NMR and MS): two phenolic acids: p-hydroxy-benzoic acid and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-benzoic acid (vanillic acid), and seven flavonoids, which are derivatives of flavonol: kaempferol 3-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (astragalin), kaempferol 3-O-(6\"-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside (nicotiflorin), quercetin 3-O-b-D-glucopyranoside (isoquercetin), quercetin 3-O-b-D-galactopyranoside (hyperoside), isorhamnetin-3-O-b-D-glucopyranoside, isoramnetin 3-O-b-D-galactopyranoside and isoramnetin 3-O-(6\"-a-L-rhamnopyranosyl)-b-D-glucopyranoside (narcissin). The butanol extract was also examined for its chemical compounds. Till now, according to the NMR spectra and the TLC analysis, the main compounds of the butanol extract are phenolics.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 14920th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSConservation and sustainable use of herbal resourcesP044. Ex situ conservation of Sideritis raeseri Boiss. & Heldr. subsp. raeseri, an important plant of high medicinal value: effect of 4 amino acids on in vitro propagation.V. Sarropoulou, E. MaloupaHellenic Agricultural Organization-DEMETER, Institute of Plant Breeding and Genetic Resources, Laboratory of Protection and Evaluation of Native and Floricultural Species, Thessaloniki, GreeceSideritis raeseri Boiss & Heldr. subsp. raeseri is a range restricted medicinal plant of the Balkan peninsula. Aerial flowering parts of Sideritis plants are widely used in the Mediterranean folk medicine as a popular tea because of its anti-inflammatory, carminative, analgesic, antitussive, stomachic, and antimicrobial properties. Conventional propagation methods (seeds, cuttings) did not allow the mass production of plant material in a short period of time. The aim was to establish an efficient protocol for mass and large-scale micropropagation, germplasm and ex situ conservation of the studied species. Amino acids provide a readily available nitrogen in tissue cultures, and their uptake can occur more rapidly than from an inorganic nitrogen source in the same medium. Amino acids are involved in stress defense promoting cell division, expansion, differentiation, and plant development as natural precursors of endogenous auxins or ethylene. The effect of 4 amino acids (L-arginine, L-methionine, L-tryptophan, L-proline) in different concentrations was investigated. The culture medium used was the MS enriched with 30 g/l sucrose, 0.5 mg/l NAA or 3 mg/l IAA and 3 g/l Phytagel. L-arginine and L-methionine negatively affected shoot proliferation, i.e. shoot number (3.17) and multiplication (75%) were higher with NAA only (8 weeks), however 100 mg/l methionine stimulated shoot elongation (41.63 mm). NAA + 5 mg/l arginine or 100 mg/l methionine gave better rooting results i.e. 91.67%, 12.27 roots 18.75 long and 66.67%, 20.5 roots 21.1 mm long, respectfully. L-tryptophan (50 mg/l) + IAA gave 75% multiplication with 2.42 shoots/ explant whereas 10 mg/l tryptophan better promoted shoot elongation (28.33 mm) and rooting (50%, 5.33 roots 12.29 mm long) (5  1/2 weeks). L-proline (500 mg/l) + NAA enhanced shoot elongation (24.67 mm) and rooting (80%, 14.25 roots 9.55 long) (6  1/2 weeks). Amino acid type and concentration affect micropropagation of S. raeseri ssp. raeseri.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org15020th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSConservation and sustainable use of herbal resourcesP045. Effect of 5 micronuntrients and 10 vitamins on in vitro propagation and ex situ conservation of medicinal Capparis orientalis Veill. from Kea Aegean island, Greece.V. Sarropoulou, E. MaloupaHellenic Agricultural Organization-DEMETER, Institute of Plant Breeding and Genetic Resources, Laboratory of Protection and Evaluation of Native and Floricultural Species, Thessaloniki, GreeceCapers can be used in cooking because of its nutritional value, pharmacology and landscape architecture. Capparis orientalis Veill. is a native Mediterranean chamaephyte that grows on coastal habitats, cliffs, rocks, walls, ravines and boulders. Biological studies of capers have revealed important uses such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-diabetes, antifungal, anti-proliferative and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities. Still, flowering buds have diuretic properties and are used against atherosclerosis, colds and atonia. Capers seeds contain ferulic and synaptic acid being of medical value, are rich in protein, oil, and fiber and could be an alternative source of edible proteins and oils. Difficulties including low seed germination and rooting rates of cuttings and existence of lignin can be overcome by the application of tissue culture, which can improve and shorten the mass production of capers. The disinfection protocol included the immersion of shoot-tip explants in a fungicide solution (25 min) followed by 70% ethanol (20 sec) and 2% NaOCl (5 min), giving 93.18% success. Initially, 2 culture media (MS, WPM) and elevated concentrations of 5 micronutrients (ZnSO4.7H2O, MnSO4H2O, CuSO4.5H2O, CoCl2.6H2O and NaFeEDTA), applied with 0.3 mg/l BA, 0.03 mg/l IAA, 25 mg/l ascorbic acid, 25 mg/l citric acid and 7 g/l agar, were tested. The MS medium containing 300 uM MnSO4.7H2O, i.e. 3-fold the normal concentration of MS gave 100% multiplication with 17.08 shoots 29.33 mm long (40 days). Afterwards, the application of 10 vitamins (myo-inositol, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine-HCl, thiamin-HCl, riboflavin, biotin, pantothenic acid, ascorbic acid, a-tocopherol, folic acid) was studied. Shoot multiplication was highest (66.67%) by adding 2.5 mg/l a-tocopherol to MS medium containing 2 mg/l IAA and 100% rooting with 0.1 mg/l biotin (8 weeks). After 4  1/2 weeks in the greenhouse mist during summer, 98.8% ex vitro survival rate was achieved for rooted microshoots on a peat: perlite substrate.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 15120th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSConservation and sustainable use of herbal resourcesP046. Development and validation of an HPLC method for the analysis of Primula veris flowers from Greece.P.-I. Chintiroglou1, N. Krigas2, P. Chatzopoulou2, A. Karioti11 Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece 2 Hellenic Agricultural Organization - DEMETER, Institute of Breeding and Plant Genetic Resources, Thessaloniki, GreeceIn the present study an HPLC-PDA method was developed for the determination of the flavonoids, in the flowers of Primula veris from Epirus, Greece. The aim was to investigate the chemical content of the over harvested Primula veris populations of Epirus, Greece and to develop and optimize an extraction protocol to allow fast, exhaustive and repeatable extraction. Qualitative analysis revealed that the Primula flowers from Epirus were particularly rich in flavonoids and especially in flavonol trisaccharides, derivatives of quercetin, isorhamnetin and kaempferol (1-3). Classical phytochemical analyses of the hydromethanolic (70%) extract afforded a new naturally occurring flavonoid, isorhamnetin-3-O-b-glucopyranosyl-(1-2)-b-glucopyranosyl-(1-6)-b-glucopyranoside (3), which is also the main constituent of the flower extracts. Its structure elucidation was carried out by means of 1D and 2D NMR and mass spectrometry analyses. An HPLC-UV method was developed and validated according to ICH guidelines. Since the main flavonols of the plant is not commercially available, rutin was used as secondary standard and the correction factor for response was determined. The HPLC method was validated for linearity, LOD, LOQ precision and accuracy in three concentration levels. R.S.D. values ranged between 0.18% and 2.67%, for the intraday variation, within the acceptable limits. The inter-day variation ranged between 0.22% and 3.37% R.S.D. Accuracy was between 96.8 and 104.4 with RSD values ranging between 0.62 and 4.20. Finally, the recovery of the extraction was proved to be over 99.5% after four extraction cycles, while the precision of the extraction expressed as RSD values varied between 1.58 and 4.66, within the acceptable limits. The developed assay was fast and simple and permitted the quality control of the herbal drug. The studied samples were particularly rich in flavonoids and the mean total content of flavonols ranged from 4.46-6.67 %mg, much higher than the 3% which is reported by the EMA [1]. Pharmacological tests on the characterized extracts are underway.OHOOH OOOHR1OHO HOOHOOHOHOOOHOHOHOOHHO1 R1 = H2 R1 = OH3 R1 = OCH3[1] EMA/HMPC/104095/2012 Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) Community herbal monograph on Primula veris L. and/or Primula elatior (L.)

First and quantitative ethnobotanical study of medicinal plants used by Mon people in Myanmar.Y. M. M. Kyaw1,2,3, X. Yang2,31 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China2 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China3 Southeast Asia Biodiversity Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nay Pyi Taw, MyanmarKnowledge on medicinal plants of the earliest habitant in Myanmar, Mon people, is absent in current literature. This first ethnobotanical research is designed and implemented to fill in this gap. We aimed at: 1) documenting the diversity of medicinal plants uses by local people in Mon State and their knowledge on therapeutic usages; 2) quantitatively identifying important medicinal plant species to local people and to evaluate their status of sustainable use. Ethnobotanical survey and interviews were carried out in 10 villages in four townships of Mon State. Data was collected from interview of 166 informants through snowball sampling method. Therapeutic usages of medicinal plants were categorized into ICPC-2 standard. Quantitative indices including Use Reports, Use Values and Fidelity Level were computed using ethnobotanyR package. Voucher specimens were collected and identified by experts. In total, 158 medicinal plant species belonging to 64 families were recorded in Mon state. Thirty-seven species were newly recorded as medicinal plants in Myanmar comparing with previous literatures. These medicinal plants are applied to 79 therapy usages classified into 14 ICPC-2 diseases. Fabaceae was the most representative family and leaf is the mostly used part. Decoction and oral administration rank top in preparation and administration methods respectively. Tinospora sinensis, Chromolaena odorata, Mimosa pudica, Tadehagi triquetrum, Alysicarpus vaginalis, are the most important medicinal plant species with highest Use Reports and Use Values. M. pudica had a high-fidelity level of 91.43% for treating dysuria. Rich and diverse medicinal plants and their traditional knowledge are recorded for Mon people in Myanmar. List of medicinal plants in Myanmar can be renewed with 37 more species added. Researches on ethnopharmacology and sustainable use of important medicinal plants used by Mon people, especially for Streptocaulon juventas, Tradescantia zebrina, Canscora lucidissima are strongly suggested.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org15420th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSEthnobotanical approach to drug discovery Theory, methodology and limitationsP048. Historical ethnobotany - some methodological considerations.A. TouwaideDivision of Humanities, UCLA, Los Angeles, USAHistorical texts are increasingly scrutinized in ethnopharmacological studies as a reservoir of time-tested information that can either provide the basis for renewed uses of ancient medications or be used as leads for novel medicines developed on the basis of ancient uses as was the case with artemisinin. However promising such approach might seem, it is not free of problems, from correct identification of the natural substances referred to as materia medica to the medical conditions for which treatment materia medica is prescribed. Based on relevant cases and recent research, this presentation will outline the problems raised by historical documentation and illustrate the results to be obtained from interdisciplinary research (from natural history, particularly botany, to (a)DNA). On this basis, it will suggest methodological guidelines that might provide the basis for further developments and the compilation of a textbook.Considering that ancient documents represent the written record of ancient therapeutic practice, this presentation will analyze both their textual and inconographic information, that it will complement with archaeological material possibly identified though (a)DNA identification. It will consider the medical conditions mentioned in the texts in relation to the populations and their genetic profile, and will analyze the pharmaceutical techniques, including the instruments. Analysis will conclude with the examination of the expected results of therapies.This presentation aims to illustrate the complex nature of the analysis of ancient therapeutic literature, which require multi-factorial analysis, trans-disciplinary in nature (including linguistic skills). Studied cases will provide clear keys to be possibly transferred in the future to other material and make it possible to gradually assemble a critical mass for the compilation of a reference guide in the field.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 15520th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSEthnobotanical approach to drug discovery Theory, methodology and limitationsP049.
