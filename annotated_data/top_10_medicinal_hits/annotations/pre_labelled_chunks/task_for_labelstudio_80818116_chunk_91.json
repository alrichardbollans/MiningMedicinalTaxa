Macedonia* edrakalska@yahoo.comIntroductionCurcumin is the active principle of the spice turmer-ic, produced by the rhizome of Curcuma longa (Zingib-eraceae), which is widely used in traditional eastern medi-cine as a hepatoprotective, anti-infectious and anti-inflam-matory remedy (Shehzad et al., 2010). A compelling body of recent evidence has shown that curcumin is endowed by pleiotropic antineoplastic effects, due to modulation of NFkB and other cell signaling pathways, implicated in cell survival, apoptosis and angiogenesis (Shehzad et al., 2010). Regretfully, the enormous therapeutic potential of curcumin can`t be exploited in clinical practice, due to its extremely unfavorable physicochemical and pharmacoki-netic characteristics, and also due to the instability in sys-temic circulation (Singh and Khar, 2006). The contribu-tion is focused on newly-synthetized octopus-shaped mac-romolecules, consisting of hydrophobic calix[4]arene core and four arms of hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) chains as platform for delivery of curcumin.Materials and methodsTwo methods for preparation of inclusion complexes were used:Heating method described by (Loftsson et al., 2005) with slight modifications. Briefly, to aqueous solutions of increasing concentrations of CX[4]PEG polyoxyeth-ylatedtertbuthylcalix[4]arene ) (2 mg/ml - 12 mg/ml) a constant amount of curcumin (1 mg/ml) that exceeded its aqueous solubility (11 ng/ml) was added. The vials were closed and heated at 50 degC for two hours. After that, the samples were left at room temperature for 24 h. Then the samples were subjected to centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. The clear transparent supernatants containing the inclusion complexes were collected and the amount of the curcumin was analyzed using a validated UV/VIS spectrophotometric method at 427 nm.Solvent evaporation method: series of samples contain-ing a fixed concentration of curcumin (1 mg/ml) and in-creasing concentrations of CX[4]PEG (2-12 mg/ml) were prepared in absolute ethanol, and evaporated to dryness us-ing a Buchi rotation-type vacuum evaporator (R-215, Sig-ma-Aldrich). The concentrations of CX[4]PEG were cho-sen on the basis of its critical micelar concentration (CMC) of 7.7 mg/ml (or 0.24 umol/ml) (Momekova et al., 2012). Thereafter the dried CX[4]PEG/curcumin containing films were hydrated with deionizaed water and were left for 2 h at 50 degC and then in dark at room temperature for 24 h. Then the samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 5000 rpm. The transparent yellow supernatants containing the cur-cumin-CX[4]PEG complexes were analyzed for curcum-in content using a validated UV/VIS spectrophotometric method. Phase-solubility profiles were obtained by plotting the solubility of drug versus the excipient concentration.Characterization of the CX[4]PEG-curcumin complexationUV/VIS spectroscopy The UV/VIS spectra of curcumin (in absolute ethanol and 10% ethanol solution) and its CX[4]PEG complex (in deionized water) were recorded on JASCO V570 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer equipped with thermostatic cell holder (Huber MPC-K6 thermostat with precision 1 degC). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy analysisSamples of pure curcumin, pure CX[4]PEG, their phys-ical mixture, and a lyophilized complex were characterized by an IRAffinity-1 Shimadzu FT-IR spectrophotometer. The scanning range was between 4000 and 400 cm-1.S4 PP 181384Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 383 - 384 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsDynamic light scattering (DLS) analysisThe size, size distribution patterns and zeta-poten-tial of curcumin loaded supramolecular CX[4]PEG aggre-gates were investigated by ZetaSizer NanoZS (Malvern In-struments), equipped with a 633 nm laser. The parameters were evaluated from the measurements at the scattering an-gle of 175 deg at 25 degC. In vitro curcumin releaseThe in vitro curcumin release from supramolecular BEC-X aggregates was evaluated by regular membrane di-alysis at 37 degC against phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 1 ml of tested formulations was placed in dialysis membrane tubing (MWCO 10,000). The dialysis bag was then placed in a temperature controlled vessel, containing 100 ml of PBS (pH 7). At various time intervals aliquots were tak-en from the released medium and assayed for curcumin by UV-VIS spectroscopy.Results and DiscussionPhase solubility studiesThe phase solubility studies of curcumin with BEC-X were performed using the procedure utilized for the evalu-ation of cyclodextrin inclusion complexes by Higuchi and Connors (Higuchi and Connors, 1965). Due to their am-phiphilic nature, polyoxyethylated calyx(4)arenes (CX[4]PEG) can self-associate in water by forming well-defined spherical nanoparticles. At concentration below the CMC, CX[4]PEG drastically increased curcumin solubility by formation of inclusion complexes with high stability con-stant (Kc). A significantly higher solubility enhancement of curcumin was observed at concentration exceeding the crit-ical micellar concentration, attributed with additional solu-bilization of curcumin into the hydrophobic domains of the supramolecular aggregates by non-covalent interactions.UV/VIS characterizationIn order to characterize the spectral behavior of cur-cumin and its inclusion complex, absorption spectra of pure curcumin in absolute ethanol and 10% ethanol are compared with the absorption spectrum of the inclusion complex in water. The characteristic absorption peak of curcumin at 427 nm is identical in the three media under investigation, which demonstrates that the inclusion com-plex is formed by non-covalent hydrophobic interactions. An interesting finding is the appearance of a shoulder at 361 nm in the spectrum of pure curcumin dissolved in 10% ethanol which cannot be seen in spectra of curcumin in ab-solute ethanol and in the inclusion complex of curcumin in water. The shoulder can be attributed to the shifting of the tautomeric equilibrium from keto-enol to diketo-form. FT-IR analysis FT-IR spectroscopy is a useful tool for characteriza-tion of inclusion complexes. Characteristic combination of a sharp peak at 3508 cm-1 and a broad peak at 3293 cm-1 in the curcumin spectrum implies the presence of aromatic OH group stretching vibrations (Kolev et al., 2005) and the inten-sive sharp peaks at 1626 cm-1 and 1601 cm-1 corresponding to mixed C=O and C=C vibrations and symmetric aromat-ic ring (C=C) stretching vibrations, respectively, did not in-terfere with the vibrations in BEC-X spectra and can be used as marks for description of curcumin in inclusion complex.DLS analysisPhysicochemical characteristics of the nanoparticles (size, size distribution and zeta potential were evaluated by DLS and the results revealed particles of app.180 nm with monomodal distribution (PDI below 0.2) and zeta potential of - 20 mV suitable for systemic application.In vitro curcumin releaseThe in vitro curcumin release profiles from supramo-lecular CX[4]PEG aggregates were studied under simulat-ed physiological conditions for different incubation peri-ods from 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 24 hours. The results showed initial burst release of curcumin, followed by slower drug release. ConclusionThus on the grounds of the excellent in vitro bio-compatibility profile and the favorable physicochemical and drug loading characteristics of the tested liposomal nanoparticles, and their ability to retain the intrinsic phar-macological properties of encapsulated drug they could be considered promising drug delivery platforms for lipophil-ic curcumin.ReferencesHiguchi, T., Connors, K.A., 1965.

Therefore, re-cent trends in the development of ER dosage forms high-light the importance of the investigation of potential al-cohol-induced dose dumping (ADD) (Anand et al., 2011; Lennernas, 2009). FDA and EMA guidances include gen-eral recommendations regarding the assessment of ADD, stating that suitable in vitro dissolution tests should be car-ried out to identify the risk of ADD, and differentiate be-tween rugged and vulnerable formulations (EMA, 2014; FDA, 2016). In addition, the International Pharmaceuti-cal Excipients Council Europe (IPEC) working group on ADD has summarized relevant scientific and regulatory in-formation to help pharmaceutical companies to better han-dle ADD issues. It has been recognized that increased sol-ubility of drugs or excipients in the presence of ethanol, and/or formulation factors (e.g. impaired ability to retard drug release), in conjunction with changes in physiological conditions after alcohol intake (e.g. delayed gastric emp-tying) are the key factors affecting the kinetics of drug re-lease from ER oral formulations. Knowledge about these factors can help to identify and develop ADD-resistant for-mulations.The purpose of this study was: (i) to evaluate different dissolution test setups to in vitro assess the effect of ethanol on dose dumping from ER tablets, and (ii) to evaluate the potential of the combined in vitro-in silico approach for the prediction of drug absorption profiles after concomitant al-cohol intake, using commercially available diclofenac so-dium ER tablets as model formulations.Materials and methodsDiclofenac sodium solubility was tested in various me-dia (0.1 M HCl pH 1.1 and USP buffers pH 6.8 and pH 7.4 without/with addition of 40% ethanol). Drug dissolu-tion from the investigated hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)-based tablets (ER1 - Diklofen(r) 100 mg diclof-enac sodium ER tablets, Galenika a.d., ER2 - Diklofenak 100 mg diclofenac sodium ER tablets, Hemofarm a.d.) was tested under different experimental conditions: (i) in pad-dle apparatus at 50 rpm, using single medium pH 7.5 (USP Test 1 for diclofenac sodium ER tablets) without/with ad-dition of 5% or 40% ethanol, and (ii) in basket apparatus at 100 rpm, using media change method (pH 1.1 without/with addition of 5% or 40% ethanol for 2 h, pH 6.8 for 2 h, pH 7.4 for 20 h). The later setup was designed to simu-late changes in physiological conditions as the drug trav-els along the gastrointestinal tract, and to approximate con-ditions in the stomach, since ethanol is mostly absorbed through the gastric mucosa. The obtained dissolution data, incorporated in drug-specific absorption model (Simcyp(r) Population-Based Simulator, v. 14.1; Certara(tm), USA), were used for in silico simulations of drug plasma concen-tration-time profiles. Drug physicochemical and pharma-cokinetic properties, used as inputs for absorption model-ling, were obtained from available literature sources or in silico estimated.Results and discussionThe solubility study results indicated that solubility-limited drug dissolution from the investigated tablets can be expected only in medium pH 1.1 without ethanol. In other words, due to increased drug solubility in the pres-ence of 40% ethanol, concomitant intake of strong alcohol beverages might induce dose dumping from diclofenac so-S4 PP 182386Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 385 - 386 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsdium ER tablets even at low pH in the stomach. Dissolution data revealed that 5% ethanol in medium pH 7.5 had no significant effect on drug release rate from the investigated tablets (similar dissolution profiles). In ad-dition, drug release profiles from the two products were similar in medium pH 7.5 with 0% and 5% ethanol. The addition of 40% ethanol in medium pH 7.5 affected drug release rate from ER2 formulation, resulting in approxi-mately 4 times shorter mean dissolution time in compari-son to the drug release profile in simple buffer. On the oth-er hand, diclofenac sodium release under \"media change\" conditions was not affected by the exposure to either 5% or 40% ethanol in acidic medium (less than 10% of drug dissolved in 2 h; similar dissolution profiles). Considering these results, the observed difference in alcohol-resistance of the investigated products in medium 7.5 with 40% eth-anol is not expected to have significant effect on drug re-lease profiles in vivo. The simulated pharmacokinetic parameters, based on the selected input data set, including drug dissolution rate under \"media change\" conditions without ethanol (Cmax 0.50/0.55 ug/ml and AUC 4.12/3.91 ug/ml h for ER1 and ER2 tablets, respectively), were in agreement with the reported data from clinical studies (Altman et al, 2015). These results indicate that the employed in vitro dissolu-tion test conditions for diclofenac sodium ER tablets could be considered biorelevant. As expected based on dissolu-tion data, the presence of ethanol in acidic medium had no effect on drug absorption profiles (the simulated phar-macokinetic parameters were Cmax 0.41-0.58 ug/ml, and AUC 3.97-4.16 ug/ml h). Simulation based on the hypo-thetical dissolution scenario, illustrating the \"worst case\", demonstrated that 100% diclofenac sodium release from 100 mg ER tablets in the stomach would alter the rate and extent of drug absorption (Cmax 2.56 ug/ml, tmax 2.16 h, AUC 6.43 ug/ml h), and consequently, the formulation would lose its modified release characteristics. But even this scenario would not pose safety issues for the patients, since the simulated plasma concentration profile is in the therapeutic range (Altman et al, 2015).ConclusionThe presented case demonstrate that in vitro disso-lution testing using the proposed \"media change\" exper-imental setup could be indicative of drug in vivo behav-iour in the presence of ethanol. In addition, the combined in vitro-in silico approach may provide insight into the ef-fect of ADD on drug clinical performance, and therefore, can serve as an alternative to clinical studies for ADD risk assessment. This approach should be encouraged, and ap-plied to other ER oral drug products.AcknowledgmentThis work was done under the project TR34007, supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of SerbiaReferencesAltman, R., Bosch, B., Brune, K., Patrignani, P., Young, C., 2015.
