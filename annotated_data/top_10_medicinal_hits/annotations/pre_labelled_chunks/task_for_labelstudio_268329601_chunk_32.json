SUGAR & OTHERSWEETENERSIn everyday language, sugar is a sweet, crystallinesolid used to flavor food, to hide disagreeable tastes,and in a variety of industrial processes. Within theplant body, sugar is an intermediate, soluble,transportable form of food. Sugars are kinds ofcarbohydrates. To a chemist, carbohydrates arepolyhydroxyaldehydes or ketone alcohols. To the restof us, they are organic compounds made up of carbon,hydrogen, and oxygen, with the hydrogen and oxygentypically occurring in a ratio of 2:1, as they do inwater.It is convenient to divide carbohydrates into twosubgroups: sugars and polysaccharides. Sugarshave simpler structures and lower molecular weights.The simplest sugars are called monosaccharides,sugars that cannot be broken down (hydrolyzed) intoeven simpler sugars. Dissacharides, on the otherhand, yield two monosaccharide sugars on hydrolysis;trisaccharides break down into three, and so on. Thepolysaccharides are chemically more complex, oftenrepresented graphically as long chains of repeatingchemical units. Two very common examples ofpolysaccharides are starch and cellulose. Starch canbe thought of as the principal food storage form inliving plants. It can be chemically converted back intosimpler, more directly usable sugars. More aboutstarch later. Cellulose is an inert material. It is thechief component of plant cell walls. It, too, is of greateconomic importance. Cotton fibers are essentiallypure cellulose. It is the main constituent in wood.There are many kinds of sugars, including dextrose,also called corn sugar or grape sugar; fructose orfruit sugar or levulose, which occurs in honey and inmany fruits; glucose, the kind found in karo syrups;lactose or milk sugar; sucrose, also known as canesugar or beet sugar; and xylose or wood sugar, whichis made by boiling corn cobs, straw, etc. Far andaway, the most economically important of thesesugars is sucrose, a disaccharide made up of glucoseand fructose. World production is about 111 millionmetric tons of raw sugar each year, from theprocessing of about 1 billion metric tons of cane and282 million metric tons of sugar beets. These twoplants concentrate enough sucrose in the jointedstems of the sugar cane and in the swollen taproot ofsugar beets to make extraction economically feasible.TIMELINE: SUGAR & SWEETENERSBCE:10000 Sugar cane domesticated510 Persian tablet provides first account of solidsugar useCE:1493 Columbus brings sugar cane to New World1523 Cane first grown in Cuba1532 Cane first grown in Brazil1605 Oliver de Serres discovers beet juice similar tosugar syrup1751 Sugar cane first planted in U.

It spread from its ancestral home to China,then to Java, and to the islands of the Pacific. Sugarcane was brought to the New World by Columbus onhis second voyage. It was first planted in the UnitedStates in New Orleans in 1751. Now it is grown inwarm areas around the world.Sugar cane is vegetatively propagated by plantingsections of stems with buds. It generally takes about1 to 1.5 years to get a crop. Current production isalmost 1 billion metric tons per year worldwide. Canerequires a great deal of water -- 2 metric tons ofwater to produce 1 kg of sugar. Plants are subject toa number of diseases and pests, including rats.PROCESSING. The crop was traditionally harvestedby hand, often by slaves. Because of the terribleconditions under which they worked, one authorityestimated that 1 ton of sugar cost the life of oneslave. Today, manual labor is still used, but so is agreat deal of specialized equipment.The processing of sugar cane consists of two phases:MillingStems washed, chopped, shredded, andpressed between giant rollersLStems chopped more finelyLSoaked in hot watersqueezed to extract more sugarLCrushed stem fiber remains (bagasse) burned to make steam to run millLLime added and the mixture heatedLFibers and soil settle out or float to surfaceL Juice pumped to evaporatorsLLoss of water yields a thick, dark syrupLPumped to vacuum pansLMore evaporation occursLSyrup boiled down to form massecuite(solid sugar crystals and liquid molasses)LMassecuite centrifuged to separatesolid and liquid phasesLSugar crystals washed (removes film of molasses)LSpinning and drying(just what it sounds like)All of the steps so far are accomplished at the mill,often located in a tropical or subtropical area close tothe sugar cane plantations. Most of them were builtmany years ago and they tend to look prettydisreputable. The product at this stage is unrefinedraw sugar. It is about 96% sucrose, a disaccharideconsisting of fructose and glucose. It also containssoil, microbes, and various other contaminants. TheFood and Drug Administration says that it is unfit forhuman consumption. Turbinado is a partially refinedform of sugar. It is washed with steam duringcentrifugation. Molasses, from the Latin for honey-like, is the syrup that remains after sucrose has beencrystallized. Its darker color comes from carmelizationand the high temperature during boiling.RefiningThe refining of raw sugar typically occurs in a separatefacility, often located somewhere far removed fromthe mill.Raw sugar melted to reform syrupLFiltered twice to yield a colored syrupLBoiled in vacuum pansLCentrifugedLAir-driedLFiltered again(diatomaceous earth, carbon black,and ground bone)Brown sugar is a form of refined sugar. Syrup hasbeen added to the processed sucrose and it isredissolved and recrystallized. A fine molasses filmremains on the sugar crystals. The sugar industryonce claimed brown sugar was so contaminated thatit should never be eaten.Average consumption of sucrose in the United Statesis about 136 lbs per person annually or about 450calories per day. Large amounts of sugar, and somepeople eat about 4 lbs/week, can meet the body'senergy needs. Consuming sugar in this amount caninhibit starch and fiber-converting enzymes. Ourstomachs then find it more difficult to digest starchand fiber. Some argue that we can become addictedto refined sugar. Some authorities believe that thereis a strong correlation between high sugarconsumption that high alcohol intake outside ofregular meals.BEET SUGARBeet sugar is derived from the swollen taproots ofBeta vulgaris var. altissima, a relative of the edibletable beet. The wild beet of northern Europe, Betamaritima, is presumably ancestral to both of them. Itwas not until the latter part of the 18th century thatthe potential of the sugar beet was realized. In thefollowing years, the chemical nature of its sugar wasfound to be identical to that of sugar cane andintensive breeding programs began. In 1993, we grew282 million metric tons of sugar beets. Sugar beetsare grown in the temperate parts of the world. Franceis the leading producer, which is not unexpected whenwe recall the edict of Napoleon Bonaparte.Extraction ProcessTopping (removal of the leaf cluster)LThorough washingLShredding taprootsLSoak material in hot water(most soluble sugar diffuses into water)LRemove impurities(add lime, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide)LFilterL-112-Concentrate clear liquid that results to yieldcrystalline sucrose.The residue that remains makes an excellent cattlefeed. As in sugar cane, the raw sugar obtained fromsugar beets is brown and must be refined to createwhite sugar. Two hundred years ago, sugar beetscontained about 6% sucrose. Today's improvedvarieties can produce up to 20% sugar.MAPLE SUGARThe indigenous peoples of North America had used thesugar maple (Acer saccharinum), and to a lesserextent, the black maple, as the source of a sweeteningagent. They made cuts in the bark of the trees in theearly spring. The sap that oozed out was collected andconcentrated by dropping hot rocks into it or byfreezing the sap and removing the layer of sugary icethat formed each day. Early European settlersmodified the procedure by drilling holes in the treesand by boiling the sap down in iron kettles. Today weuse power drills, perhaps even the battery-poweredmodels! Final processing occurs in the \"sugar house,\"where the maple sap is concentrated even more in anevaporator to yield maple syrup. If boiled evenfurther, the product will be the crystalline solid calledmaple sugar.Maple sugar is mostly sucrose. The sugar content ofthe sap is only about 2-6%, much lower than that ofcane or beets. One reason why maple sugar is soexpensive is that it takes about 40 gallons of sugarmaple sap to make one gallon of maple syrup."
