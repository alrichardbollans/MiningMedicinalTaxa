      "text": "The major plantfamilies from which tropical fruits are derived includethe cashew family (Anacardiaceae), which comes as asurprise to many of us who know only its mostcommon North American representatives -- poisonoak, poison ivy, and poison sumac; the custard applefamily (Annonaceae); the myrtle family (Myrtaceae),also a source of many ornamental shrubs; the citrusfamily (Rutaceae); the sapote family (Sapotaceae);and the soapberry family (Sapindaceae).In the survey that follows, I will devote most of theattention to six of the major tropical fruits andcomment briefly on a few others of interest.BANANA AND RELATIVES\"There is nothing so delicious as a banana. \"(Benjamin Disraeli)The banana was domesticated in Southeast Asia; itswild counterparts can still be found there today. Thereare about 25-30 species and subspecies in cultivation.The banana of commerce is Musa x paradisiaca. About300 cultivars are now planted.THE BANANA AND ITS ALLIESMusa acuminata Cavendish, dwarf, ChineseMusa balbisianaMusa corniculata horse bananaMusa discolorMusa erransMusa nana dwarf bananaMusa oleracea banana poreteMusa x paradisiaca banana, plantain, platanoMusa superba wild plantainMusa troglodytarum fe'iMusa textilis Manila hempEnsete ventricosum Abyssinian bananaA banana \"tree\" is actually a large, tree-like herb. Itcan reach a height of 25 ft. The trunk of a bananaplant is a series of overlapping leaf bases, hiding asmall central shoot that will later give rise to theflower cluster. The bulk of the stem system is a large,fleshy rhizome that lies underground. The leaves maybe 10-12 ft long. They are simple, but often appearpinnately compound because of the fraying of theblade that results from wind damage. The flowercluster is large and drooping, with the growing tip atthe bottom end of the inverted cluster. The femaleflowers, which will eventually produce the fruits, areborne toward the base of the cluster. The male flowersare toward the tip. These unisexual flowers, althoughconspicuous and attractive, are sterile. A plant willbegin to bear fruit in about 8-14 months. A maturefruiting cluster can weigh up to 140 lbs. Individualbananas occur in small bunches, known in theindustry as \"hands. \"By the way, if banana flowers are sterile, where didthose fruits come from? Review the brief discussion ofparthenocarpy in the introductory section.Bananas are harvested while green. They are soperishable that if they were picked after maturing,they would spoil before reaching the markets. After aplant has borne fruit, it usually dies back or is cutdown. Bananas are loaded on air-conditioned ships fortransport to world markets. The hold is usually kept atabout 14E C to prevent premature ripening. Thetemperature will later be raised to begin thematuration process. At that stage, the bananas turnfrom green to yellow and starch begins to change tosugar.Many different cultivars are now available, but we seeonly a few of them in our temperate markets. Ourlocal stores are carrying more than they once did.Until a few years ago, the most common cultivar was\"Gros Michel\" or \"Big Mike.\" It was wiped out by thedreaded Panama disease. Big Mike has been replacedby \"Valery\" and \"Lacatan. \"Modern bananas and their relatives contain fivegenomes (A, B, E, F, and T). All edible bananas-90-contain either the A (Acuminata) or B (Balbisiana)chromosome sets (AAA, AAB, ABB, BBB). The industryis based upon an AAA triploid [2n = 3x = 33]. Bananafruits are seedless, and therefore sterile, because ofthe genetic complications that arise from having threeidentical sets (AAA) of chromosomes competing withone another as they go through meiosis. Bananas arepropagated vegetatively by cuttings taken from themother plant.A close relative of the banana is the plantain, alsoknown as the platano or cooking banana. It is verywidely used in tropical countries as a food plant, butwas rarely seen in our markets until recent years. Theplantain must be cooked before use because it storescarbohydrates in the form of starch, rather thansugar. The cooking process converts starch to sugar.The only other economically important species is Musatextilis, the Manila hemp. It is not grown for its ediblefruits, but for its fibers. They are used in heavy ropesand in very delicate tea bags.A less known relative is Ensete ventricosum, theensete or Abyssinian banana. It is grown in Africa forfiber and for food - not from nice fleshy fruits. Theedible portions are the young shoots, leaf bases,flowers, and seeds.CITRUS FRUITSThe various citrus fruits, excluding the grapefruit andnumerous hybrids, all appear to be native toSoutheast Asia. The plants are shrubs or small treeswith compound leaves reduced to a single leaflet. Theplants have a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi inthe soil. Citrus plants are said to lack root hairs andthis relationship is probably explained on this basis. Allof the species are diploids [2n = 2x = 18].Most citrus production is in the New World, in bothtemperate and tropical areas. More oranges are grownthan any other citrus fruit. Annual production is about56 million metric tons; Brazil is the leading producer.Next comes the tangerine, at about 10 million metrictons, mostly from Japan. About 13 million metric tonsof lemons, limes, grapefruits, and pomelos areproduced each year. The United States is the leadingproducer.Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C, just as you havealways been told. The rind contains numerous oilglands, the basis of a famous parlor trick that I will tellyou about in lecture. The part of the fruit that we eatis a series of thick, juicy hairs that line the paperyseptations within the fruit. Look very closely nexttime!Some citrus fruits, such as the orange and thegrapefruit, are allowed to ripen on the tree. Others,such a lemons and limes, are harvested green. Manyoranges are artificially colored or treated with gases orother chemicals to destroy the green chlorophylls inthe flesh of the fruit to give it a better appearance onthe market shelf.The more familiar citrus fruits are the orange, lemon,lime, mandarin orange, tangerine, kumquat, citron,pomelo, shaddock, and sour orange. The grapefruitappears to be a spontaneous, recent hybrid betweenthe orange and the pomelo. All of them are variousspecies of Citrus, except for the kumquat. It belongsto the genus Fortunella.SUMMARY OF THE GENUS CITRUSSubgenus: Scientific/Common Name.

C (ascorbic acid) from fresh vegetablesand fruits. Tens of thousands of sailors died fromscurvy, especially from the 15th to the 18th centuries.One of the earliest scientific investigations was that ofDr. James Lind, who published \"A Treatise on Scurvy\"in 1753. He concluded that various citrus fruits werevery effective in the prevention and treatment ofscurvy. It would take almost a century for the Lords ofthe Admiralty to approve the use of lime juice onBritish naval vessels. Now you know why Britishsailors are called limeys.Here are typical symptoms of the disease:' Longing for land, greenery, home' Uncontrollable weeping' Depression' Weakening of capillaries' Subcutaneous bleeding' Anemia' Skin \"black as ink\"' Ulcers on legs' Loose teeth' Gums protruding from mouth' Really bad breath!' Stiffness/soreness of joints' Slow healing of wounds' Difficult breathing' Overwhelmed by stimuli' Death-91-COCONUT\"He who plants a coconut tree, plants food and drink,vessels and clothing, a habitation for himself, and aheritage for his children. \"(Polynesian traditional saying)' ' ' ' 'As inhabitants of the temperate zone, it is all butimpossible for us to appreciate Cocos nucifera, whichhas been called \"one of Nature's greatest gifts toMan,\" the \"tree of life,\" the \"tree of heaven,\" and\"Mankind's greatest provider in the tropics.\" There itprovides food, drink, oil, medicine, fiber, timber,thatch, mats, fuel, and domestic utensils. In additionto these utilitarian aspects, the coconut has alsoplayed a prominent role in the customs and beliefs oftropical peoples.The home of the coconut remains controversial. Itappears to have been present in both the Old Worldand the Americas before 1492. The fruit is able tofloat for a hundred days or more in salt water; thebest ocean currents are from Asia to the New World.It was probably first domesticated in the Indo-Pacificregion. There are no reproductive or geneticdifficulties here. 2n = 2x = 32.The coconut is a kind of palm. The trees can produce50-100, to as many as 500 fruits per year. The firstcrop typically comes on in about 6-8 years. The fruitis single-seeded. The fruit wall is clearly differentiatedinto an outer layer (exocarp) that is woody; a middlelayer (mesocarp) that is fibrous; and an inner, bonylayer (endocarp) that is more or less fused to the seedcoat. When we see coconuts in our markets, theexocarp and mesocarp have been removed duringprocessing. The coconut \"seed\" is the true seed, plusthe innermost layer of the fruit wall, the endocarp.After harvesting, the fruits are cut in half and thecoconut meat is gouged out. It will be cured in the sunor in kilns to yield copra. It contains about 60-68%oil. Coconut oil is about 90% saturated and it is one ofthe \"tropical oils\" that manufacturers are increasinglyproud to say they are no longer using in their foods.Once the oil has been removed from copra, theresidue (coconut cake) is used for cattle feed. It is arich source of protein and carbohydrates. Curiously, itis rarely eaten by humans, even in areas whereprotein is otherwise deficient.The middle portion of the fruit wall, the fibrousportion, is the source of coir. This fiber, sometimessold under the name coco fiber, is used for mats,rugs, filters, stuffing, and rope. Various plant partsyield sennit fiber used to make ropes, hats, andother items.DATE PALM\"Honor your maternal aunt, the palm, for it wascreated from the clay left over after the creation ofAdam (on whom be peace and the blessings of God!\" (The Prophet Muhammad)' ' ' ' 'We have been cultivating Phoenix dactylifera for 6000-8000 years. According to Muslim tradition, the firstdate palms arose from the dust left over from thecreation of Adam. This explains one of the plantscommon names, the \"tree of life.\" Wild populationswith small, inedible fruits may still be found in SaudiArabia and the Sahara. Today the domesticated formsare found on the fringes of African and Asian deserts.The date palm was introduced into California in 1765at Mission San Ignacio. This state and Arizona areleading producers in the U. S. The palm trees on theArcata plaza are Ph. canariensis, a relative of the datepalm native to the Canary Islands.The leaves of the date palm are used for thatchingand matting, and its trunks for building materials. Thefruit is a drupe, with a brown skin (exocarp), a sweetjuicy pulp (mesocarp), and a thin, bony layer(endocarp) surrounding a single seed. The fruits havea high sugar content. They may be consumed fresh,dried, or pounded into a paste. In the Arab world,they are often eaten with milk. If properly dried, theywill last indefinitely. A single tree can produce about100 lbs. of dates each year. Trees may continue tobear fruit for 100-200 years. Maturing fruits are oftenbagged to protect them from birds and insects. Weharvest dates the same way that we did in ancienttimes -- by hand, with a sharp knife.The Hebrews and Babylonians carried out a ritualceremony to ensure that a good crop of dates wouldbe produced. Even though the concept of sexuality inplants would not be discovered until the close of the17th century, they had found that it was necessary tobring pollen-bearing flowers into the oases where thedate palms grew. The cultivated date palm is a femaleplant and it must be fertilized with pollen from a maledate palm tree if it is to produce fruit. For thousandsof years, we have maintained a few, isolated maletrees wherever we cultivate the date palm for thispurpose. Although its seeds are fertile, we usually cutoff sucker shoots at the base of the trunk to grow newdate palms.We also discovered that we could ferment the sap ofthe date palm and produce arrak, which one sixteenthcentury traveler called \"the strongest and mostdreadful drink ever invented. \"PINEAPPLEAnanas comosus, native to the New World, wasunknown to Europeans until it was first seen byColumbus in 1493 on Guadaloupe Island. By thattime, the inhabitants of tropical America had alreadyselected seedless varieties for their use. Their wildcounterparts with numerous seeds could still be seengrowing in the vicinity of villages. When the pineapplewas introduced to Europe, it was considered aninteresting oddity, but certainly not an edible fruit.Leading growers include Costa Rica, the United States(principally in Hawaii), Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, andSouth Africa.The pineapple plant is an herb with a basal clump ofstiff, sword-shaped leaves. Many of the cultivars havesharp teeth on the leaf margins. The widely usedCayenne cultivar does not. The flowers are borne atthe center of the rosette of leaves. At first, the flowersare separate from one another, but as the plant setsfruit, the individual fruits from adjacent flowers fusewith one another to form a false fruit, the familiarpineapple. The hole in the center of canned pineapplerepresents the area once occupied by the central axisof the fruiting cluster. A plant can bear fruit in aboutone year. After the first pineapple has been cut fromthe plant, the growing point divides and the next cropwill be two, smaller pineapples per plant. After these-92-are harvested, the growing point divides once again,and four even smaller pineapples are produced. Theseare often used to make pineapple juice. After the 4-pineapple stage, replanting occurs. Except forhandpicking, the pineapple industry is now almostcompletely automated.Modern cultivars are also seedless. Unlike the banana,however, there are no genetic difficulties that preventsexual reproduction from occurring. We see to that byexcluding the pollinators needed for cross-polination.The fruits contain about 15% sugar, some organicacids, minerals, and a proteolytic enzyme calledbromelain. Because it can digest animal tissue,workers in the pineapple fields and processing plantsmust wear protective clothing. Test the power ofbromelain yourself by allowing the juice of areasonably fresh pineapple to remain on your lips.Note the tingling sensation as the enzyme begins todissolve the delicate tissue of your buccal orifice!FIGThe ancestral home of Ficus carica is probablysouthern Arabia. It spread quickly to theMediterranean. There are now several kinds of figs incultivation, notably the common fig, the Capri fig, andthe Smyrna fig. As in the pineapple, the sap of the figcontains a proteolytic enzyme that is the cause of anoccupational hazard called \"fig-pickers disease. \"FIG RELATIVESBanyan tree Ficus benghalensisWeeping fig Ficus benjaminaIndian rubber tree Ficus elasticaBo tree Ficus religiosaSycamore fig Ficus sycamorusCreeping fig Ficus pumilaStrangler fig Ficus spp.Mulberry Morus spp.Osage-orange Metopium toxiferumBreadfruit Artocarpus altilisJackfruit Artocarpus heterophyllusFRUIT STRUCTUREThe fig is a false fruit. What appears to be the skinand much of the flesh of the \"fruit\" is a receptacle,which is stem tissue.
