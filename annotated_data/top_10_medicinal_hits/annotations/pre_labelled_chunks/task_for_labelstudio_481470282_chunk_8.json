      "text": "Next to issues of power, this is foremost due to a lack of insight by the (often highly specialized) Western actors into a) the complexity of local knowledge (LK) and b) their own biases in studying the topic stemming from their disciplinary, organizational and personal backgrounds. Thus, researching LK also encompasses a reflection on one's own contribution to shaping said 'understanding'.In this context, this research aims at facilitating an inclusive approach by suggesting a social-science based framework approach to understanding LK that is applicable to a broad range of LK forms in industrializing and industrialized countries. Moreover, next to being accordant with basic sustainability principles and allowing for a critical reflection of one's own situatedness, the framework is also expected to allow for comparative studies.Methodically, the research is based on an extended literature analysis across sociology, philosophy, anthropology, geography and the ethno-sciences. Against this backdrop, suitable theory-based generic dimensions - in total 16 - have been identified and aggregated in a conceptual-analytical framework according to Jabareen1/Dowding2/Stanley3.In conclusion, an interdisciplinarily-founded framework on understanding LK is proposed. Its purpose consists in facilitating the understanding of principally any given LK form through a theory-based minimal set of interconnected key dimensions and questions. Given its normative foundation in SD, this social-science based approach to LK provides interested parties with a differentiated way to gain comprehensive insights into local contexts as a basis for determining suitable conservation and management approaches.

Mitigating climate change in Valmalenco (so, Italy): how can Ethnobotany contribute?M. Bottoni1,2, C. Giuliani1,2, L. Colombo1,2, F. Milani1,2, K. Nallio1,2, P.S. Colombo1,2, P. Bruschi3, G. Fico1,21 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Milan, Italy2 Ghirardi Botanic Garden, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Milan, Toscolano Maderno, Brescia, Italy3 Department of AgriFood Production and Environmental Sciences, University of Florence, ItalyThis ethnobotanical survey is part of the Interreg Italy-Switzerland project B-ICE [1], which is aimed to create a new management model for the ongoing climate change and to reach new sources for the local enhancement. The work was performed in Valmalenco (SO, Italy) and aimed at investigating the traditional uses of the local plants. The retreat of the glaciers and the snowfall reduction are the main transformations in the natural landscape [2,3,4]. The territory is no longer suitable for winter tourism and this has major consequences for the local economy. Traditional ethnobotanical uses are an important part of the rich biocultural heritage locally available; promotion of this heritage could represent an alternative strategy for the economic development of the area. Attention was paid to the common and dialectal names of the plants, their survival, their past or actual use, the preparation forms, the administration methods and the therapeutic indications. In summer 2019, 300 interviews were collected and it emerged that the used species are 150. Out of the most cited ones, Achillea moschata Wulfen is used for digestive purposes, as analgesic, hypotensive, for gynaecological infections caused by Candida spp., as anti-inflammatory and ulcers healing in the lower limbs and against intestinal swelling in bovine. Malva sylvestris L. is used as emollient, relaxing and purifying, in case of allergies, for acne reactions and soothing baths, Thymus pulegioides L., as expectorant, for sore throat and cold and Achillea millefolium L., for menopause symptoms, footbaths, as disinfectant for wounds on bovine paws. This knowledge will define the \"cultural landscape\" of the territory and will allow to select symbol species, with the purpose of realizing a high-rise Botanic Garden. This place will aim to preserve the plants and the biocultural diversity and to attract a new form of tourism based on the rediscovery of ethnobotanical traditions.

Ethnopediatric knowledge among mothers living in Southern Romania.M. Petran, M. GilcaDepartment of Functional Sciences 1- Biochemistry, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, RomaniaMedicinal plants have a long history of ethnopediatric use in Romania. Our aim is to establish which plants are used for treating children diseases nowadays in Southern Romania. Ethnopediatric knowledge was recorded using structured interviews focused on respondent demographics (age, community of residence), local names of useful plants, part(s) used, means of preparation and administration, local folk indications of taxa. All the mothers (104) with 0 to 18-year-old children hospitalised between September 2019- January 2020 in \"Grigore Alexandrescu\" Children Emergency Hospital Bucharest and living in Southern Romania were enrolled in the study and interviewed. Use Value Citation Index (UV) and Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) were calculated. A total of 22 plants were found to be used to treat children diseases in Southern Romania; 68 informants are living in urban area and 36 in rural area. Most frequently used plants were mint (Mentha spicata L.) in 51 cases (UV=0.519) in diarrhoea - ICF=0.97, chamomille (Matricaria chamomilla L.) in 32 cases (UV=0.307) in colic - ICF=0.5 and skin infections - ICF=0.75, and silver linden (Tilia tomentosa Moench) in 19 cases (UV=0.182) in acute respiratory diseases - ICF=0.66 and anxiety and agitation - ICF=0.66. Less used plants were garlic and pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) in intestinal worms, onion in acute respiratory diseases, heartsease (Viola tricolor L.) in hives, wheat bran (Triticum aestivum L.) in dermatitis, dill (Anethum graveolens L.) in colics and greater celandine (Chelidonium majus L.) in skin verruca and acute hepatitis. One informant reported insertion of a garlic clove in the rectum to treat oxyuriasis. In 44 cases plant treatment was associated with drugs. About 1/3 plants were recommended by physicians and 2/3 by family members. In 4 cases plant indication was collected from internet. In conclusion, medicinal plants still represent an important indication in the treatment of various pediatric diseases in Southern Romania.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 8120th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSEthnobotanical approach to drug discovery Theory, methodology and limitationsO17. Nagoya protocol and the need for new forms of collaboration.F. Scotti1, M. Berger2, A. Hesketh3, M. Hitziger4, M. Heinrich11 UCL School of Pharmacy, London, UK2 Centro de Estudios en Salud, Universidad del Valle de Guatemala3 Indigena Biodiversity Limited, Gerrards Cross, United Kingdom4 CITES Secretariat, Palais des Nations, Geneve 10, SwitzerlandThe Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), followed by the Nagoya Protocol (NP), responded to the need to proactively engage in ethical practices when investigating the use of genetic resources across countries to overcome a long history of resource exploitation. In terms of access and benefit sharing (ABS), the CBD defined the framework while the NP proposed more practical directions as to how to resolve those problems. Implementation at national levels needs to ensure that all collaborators are treated fairly and that our scientific projects take account of each party's requests and desires. The lack of clarity at a national level about their implementation drove some investors and collaborators away, putting countries that ratified the NP or CBD at an economic disadvantage. Examples of NP-abiding projects with lucrative commercial outcomes are rare and are often not in the public domain. In this case-study, funded by the UK's Darwin Initiative and with indigenous and government stakeholders in Guatemala we jointly develop a new paradigm on how to conduct a scientific project that follows the rules and fulfils all requirements prescribed by the NP. A collaboration between UCL (London), UVG (Guatemala), an industrial partner (Indigena Biodiversity Ltd.) and an indigenous group in Guatemala, analyses case-studies for patients' medicinal plants uses which potentially are also of interest for industrial development. The outcome will be the documentation of the process (agreement/disagreements on all points, discussions, ABS terms). Tools for the application of NP will be produced and made available openly. The importance of continuous discussion and regular meeting of all stakeholders, alongside classic negotiation methods, is a core element of these transdisciplinary processes. Therefore, the inclusion of indigenous partners is an essential element of this equitable partnership. One year into the project, we will be presenting our strategy, methods, as well as some preliminary ethnobotanical/ethnomedical data.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org8220th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSEthnobotanical approach to drug discovery Theory, methodology and limitationsO18. Traditional Chinese Medicine: A Global Exchange.E.R. Qi, E. Brand, M. Zhou, Z. ZhaoSchool of Chinese Medicine, Hong Kong Baptist University, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong SARThe history of medicine is not complete without considering the history of trade. Throughout time, the exchange of goods helped shape the medical field in various cultures. While physical goods are the easiest to track, the introduction of new knowledge and illnesses also shifted priorities and understanding in medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine is not exempt from the influence of global trade. For example, the Ming Dynasty scholar Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica recorded 10% of imported medicinals that were known and used in traditional Chinese medicine; some well-known imports include myrrh, frankincense, etc. However, the exchange was not one-sided. Various Chinese medicinals, such as tea and gingko biloba, have also been exported. Some of these medicinals are used for the exact same purpose in the exported country, while others found different indications. The current idea of drug discovery is geared towards conventional medicine--extracting, refining, and chemically reproducing. The limitations of traditional medicinals translating to conventional medicine is well explored with concerns from the misunderstanding of its original system to the ability to reproduce results clinically. However, with the age of information, drug discovery should also be considered on the level of traditional medicine systems. For example, whether common Western herbals can be integrated into systems such as traditional Chinese medicine. As modern globalization brings the world together, information is easier to access than ever, and modern technologies offer a different perspective on old knowledge. Moving forward, traditional Chinese medicine should consider the integration of other medicinals as it did historically, and conventional medicine should evaluate traditional medicinals within their systems as they are meant to be.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 8320th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSEthnobotanical approach to drug discovery Theory, methodology and limitationsO19. Plants used as ethnomedicine for rheumatic disorders by Williche people.R. Saavedra-RodriguezDepartamento de Ciencias Basicas, Universidad Santo Tomas, Osorno, ChileThe present study assesses the state of ethno-medicinal plant knowledge by Williche people in Los Lagos Region, Southern Chile. Fieldwork was conducted to the study area from August 2015 to March 2016, supplemented by follow-up visits during 2016. Data were collected in San Juan de la Costa through collection of medicinal plants, semi- structured interviews, forest walks, participant observation and informal conversation. Fourteen informants were interviewed, 5 were local healers. Most were elderly people.Twenty-six medicinal plants in 24 genera from 19 families were indicated by the informants. They were listed with scientific name, vernacular name, plant parts used, method of preparation, and traditional use. The most important families in terms of taxa were Asteraceae (5 species), and Solanaceae, Lamiaceae, and Urticaceae (2). Orchidaceae, and Aextoxicaceae (1) were also considered important for other ailments.The documented plants were used to treat rheumatic disorders, but also blood cholesterol, circulatory problems, and wound healing. Shrubs (9 species) and herbs (9) were the most used life forms followed by trees (5), and climbing plants (3). The most frequently used plant parts were leaves (58.8 %) followed by whole plant (12.1 %), twigs (9.1 %) and stems (6 %). The plants used were 12 native to Chile, 5 endemic, and 9 exotic. The most frequently used preparation methods were poultice application (93 %) followed by decoctions (7 %). Species richness were mainly Magnoliopsida (88.4%) and Liliopsida (11.5%).The present study documents plant diversity showing that medicinal plant knowledge and cultural beliefs are still present in the Williche community for rheumatic problems. Further ethnobotanical studies on healing practices and transmission on ethno-medicinal knowledge to young generations are required for the conservation of the local forest and the communities themselves.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org84Greek EthnopharmacologyOrals20th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyO20. Herbal remedies in an Alexandrian manuscript of late antiquity.M. MarselosDepartment of Pharmacology, Medical Faculty, School of Health Sciences, University of Ioannina, GreeceA medical manuscript with the title Dynameron is kept in the Marciana National Library of Venice (Cod. gr. Z. 295) and originates from a text initially written in Greek by a physician named Aelius Promotus, who lived and worked in Alexandria (1st to 2nd century AD). Dynameron of Aelius Promotus contains 130 chapters dealing with different diseases and their treatment. He describes 870 recipes, composed of 430 ingredients (about 300 medicinal plants, 70 animal products and 60 minerals). The large number of ingredients used in each recipe implies that Aelius Promotus was a follower of the so called \"Empiric school\" of medicine, although in his work are easily recognizable also influences from other theoretical sects. Most of the plants used in Dynameron are of well-established use and they originate from the larger Mediterranean area. However, in his recipes there are also some unusual products (such as pepper, ginger, cinnamon and cassia), showing that trade with remote regions in Asia had been highly developed in the late phase of the Roman Empire. Some of the recipes refer to ingredients that cannot be granted any apparent therapeutic reasoning. Additionally, some treatments seem more like superstitious rituals. However, when Dynameron is evaluated as a whole, the conclusion is that Aelius Promotus was a competent practicing physician with great experience, typical of the famous medical tradition of Alexandria during the late Roman era. There is evidence that Dynameron was highly estimated and was copied several times thereafter, in order to serve as a therapeutic manual, a kind of \"vademecum\", for the common ailments a physician might encounter in his everyday practice.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org8620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyO21.
