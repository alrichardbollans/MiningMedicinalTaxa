Seed samples of landraces and relevant information were collected in 237 villages from 58 municipalities and pre-served at the Faculty's Gene bank. Considering that the ac-tivities are continuous, until now a total number of 1025 samples are collected. They will be analyzed in a field ex-periment to eliminate duplicates and to characterize and evaluate the landraces.Results and discussionThe collected 1025 samples belong to three types of beans. Two types are common bean belonging to the spe-cies Phasolus vulgaris L.: ssp. nanus or bush bean (BB) and ssp. volubilis or pole bean (PB). The third one is runner bean (RB) belonging to the species Phaseolus coccineus L. Regarding to the type, distribution of samples is 590 BB, 395 PB and 40 RB, indicating that the last type is facing extinction. The analysis based on seed color only, showed that white seeded beans share 46.9% of the collection with 310 samples of BB, 155 of PB and 16 of RB. Further di-vision for the white seeded beans only has been done ac-cording to the seed shape on 4 general categories: kidney, round, oval and compressed. Highest amount (123) of PB samples was with compressed shape (like the famous local landrace Tetovski grav). Within the BB collection, three types of samples are almost equally distributed: oval (120), kidney (101) and round (79). Out of the 177 samples of mono-colored seeds, landraces with brown seeds prevail (30; 25), followed by cream (19; 30) and green (2; 35) of PB and BB, respectively. Other colors were much less present with 21 black, 10 dark red, 3 dark lilac and 2 dark green-blue seeded samples. A category bicolored seed (26 samples in total) refers to seeds with oval or round shape that have one half white and one half colored seed. In this category, the colored half has various colors and often an additional pattern.The rest of the collected samples (341) belong to the colored seeds with pattern. Many different combinations of size, shape, color and pattern type (speckles, stripes etc.) are registered. Most distributed are cream seeds with dark red or brown speckles, as well as brown seeds with dark brown or black stripes or speckles. If additional categories are added in the analysis in total, like size and shape of the seeds, color and type of the pattern, as well as vegetative characteristics of the plants, it is obvious that diversity of landraces is huge. ConclusionFrom the preliminary analysis of the bean collection based on the seed color only with several parameters it may be predicted that more than 300 different landraces are col-lected. Thus, the collection presents a valuable gene pool which will be further analyzed for all traits according to bean descriptors. Landraces with colored seeds will be par-ticularly promoted for their nutritional and medicinal val-ue.ReferencesBarrett, M.L., Udani, J.K., 2011.

(Asteraceae) extracts on colon colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell linesOzge Taranci1, Selcen Babaoglu Aydas2*, Belma Aslim11Gazi University, Faculty of Science, Department of Biology, 06500, Teknikokullar, Ankara, Turkey.2Gazi University, Vocational High School of Health Services, 06830, Ankara/Golbasi, Turkey* selcenb@gmail.comIntroductionAdenocarcinomas are the cancer of intestinal gland cells and the representative of more than 95% of colon and rectal cancers. \"Adeno\" is the prefix for gland and the intes-tinal gland cells that line the inside of the colon and/or rec-tum, where the adenocarcinomas typically start. A reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer is possible although the screening techniques are imperfect (CTCA, 2016).Flavonoids exert their anticarcinogenic effects by modulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, apop-tosis, angiogenesis and metastasis. Flavonoids are proved to be highly effective scavengers of most types of oxidiz-ing molecules, including singlet oxygen and various free radicals, which are possibly involved in DNA damage and tumor promotion (Sandhar et al., 2011). Apoptosis is an important way to maintain cellular homeostasis between cell division and cell death. So, one of the useful strategies for anticancer drug development is the induction of apop-tosis in cancer cells (Kwon et al., 2006).It has been reported by pharmacological trials that some members of the genus Centaurea possess antiinflam-matory, antimicrobial, antipyretic, cytotoxic, and immuno-logical activities (Zengin et al., 2010). The present study was carried out to evaluate the apoptotic and antioxidant effects and to determine the possible mechanisms of cell death elicited by the extracts of Centaurea depressa on hu-man colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2.Materials and methodsPlant material and extract preparationC. depressa was harvested from field in Golbasi, An-kara, Turkey. The identification of plant materials was con-firmed by plant taxonomist, Prof. Dr. Zeki AYTAC, at the Department of Biology, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey. A voucher specimen was deposited at the Herbarium of Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey. The aboveground tis-sues were shade dried, powdered and 30 g samples were separately extracted with either methanol or water, using Soxhlet apparatus for 6 h and the extracts were filtered and concentrated in rotary evaporator. Cell lines and culture mediumCaco-2 cell lines obtained from ATCC were cultured in DMEM with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37 @C with 5% CO2 (Hadjiakhoondi et al., 2013). The cells were planted in microtiter plates at an initial density of 1 x 104 cells/well. After optimum confluence cells were exposed to CME or CWE (500 ug/mL) as determined to be the effective dose in former antiproliferation experiments for 48 h. Untreated cells were considered as controls.Determination of the total antioxidant capacityCayman's antioxidant assay was used to determine the total antioxidant capacity. The assay relies on the abil-ity of antioxidants in the sample to inhibit the oxidation of ABTS (2,2'-Azino-di(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-sulphonate) to ABTS*+ by metmyoglobin. The capacity of the antiox-idants in the sample to prevent ABTS oxidation is com-pared with that of Trolox, a water-soluble tocopherol ana-logue, and is quantified as millimolar Trolox equivalents. The ABTS produced by the cells after the extract treatment were measured according to the kit's protocol.Determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activityCayman's superoxide dismutase assay kit was used. The kit utilizes a tetrazolium salt for detection of superox-ide radicals generated by xanthine oxidase and hypoxan-S5 PP 226476Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 475 - 476 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsthine. One unit of SOD is defined as the amount of en-zyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superox-ide radical. The measurements were achieved according to the kit's protocol.Cell death detection assayApoptosis was determined by a Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS assay. This kit is based on a photometric en-zyme immunoassay and is used to detect DNA fragmen-tation; mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cy-toplasm by biotinylated anti-histone- and peroxidase-cou-pled anti-DNA antibodies, following the manufacturer's protocol. The enrichment factor (total amount of apopto-sis) was calculated by dividing the absorbance of the sam-ple (A405) by the absorbance of the controls without treat-ment (A490) which was equal to 1.Detection of apoptosis associated morphological changes with Hoechst 33342.Apoptotic effects of plant extracts were evaluated with Hoechst 33342 staining assay determining the morpholog-ical alterations in the cells. Propidiumiodide (PI) is used to detect the necrotic cells. Cells were imaged with fluores-cence microscope (Turk et al., 2011). Apoptotic index was defined as the percentage (%) of apoptotic cells and cal-culated with the formula; number of apoptotic cells / total number of cells x 100 (Jackisch et al., 2000).StatisticsResults are expressed as means +- Standard deviation (SD). Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and means were compared using the Tukey's test, with P<0.05 considered as statistically significant. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times, with triplicate samples for each treatment.Results and discussionIn our former experiments investigating the antipro-liferation activity of the C. depressa methanol (CME) and water extracts (CWE) in varying concentrations (100, 250 and 500 ug/mL), the results exhibited a dose dependent trend and both methanol and water extracts showed a sig-nificant antiproliferative activity on Caco-2 cells with 500 ug/mL concentration (63%, 69% cell death, respective-ly). So this study was carried out to evaluate the apoptotic and antioxidant effects of the extracts and to determine the possible mechanisms of cell death elicited by the extracts of C. depressa (500 ug/mL) on Caco-2 cell line. Activi-ties of total antioxidant enzymes were analysed using Cay-mans's kit, however no detectable change were observed as compared with the control cells (0.31+-0.02 mM Trolox) (p<0.5). Similar results were also found in the SOD activi-ty (0.8+-0.03 U/mL) (p<0.5) and SOD activity also did not vary according to the extract type.Apoptotic effect of CME and CWE (500 ug/mL) on the Caco-2 cells were determined by cell death detection after 48 hours incubation. Apoptotic effect of the CME and CWE are higher as compared to the control group with the enrichment factor of 1.69-fold and 1.98-fold respectively and the CWE has higher apoptotic effect than CME.Hoechst 33342 staining revealed the morphological changes including cell shrinkage and nuclear condensa-tion occurred with C. depressa; producing a more brighter blue light in apoptotic cells compared to normal cells that showed normal nuclear morphology. Dead cells had violet-red fluorescence and showed no signs of chromatin con-densation and apoptotic bodies. PI dye cannot cross cell membrane of dead cells, as opposed to apoptotic cells. The extracts may have inhibited cell growth via inducing apop-tosis. Therefore apoptotic index was defined as the percent-age (%) of apoptotic cells stained with Hoechst 33342 dye and the results indicate that CME and CWE exhibited sig-nificant high apoptotic index following 48 hours treatment in favor of CWE (47% and 60% respectively).ConclusionC. depressa exhibited considerable apoptotic effects on Caco-2 cancer cell lines. Studies investigating the bio-active ingredients of these herbal extracts would pave the way for mechanistic and translational studies in efforts to design novel anticancer drugs to be used alone or concom-itant with other therapies to prevent progression of tumors and/or to treat them.ReferencesCancer Treatment Center, 2016. http://www.cancercenter.com/colorectal-cancer/types/ (accessed on: March, 2016).Hadjiakhoondi, F., Ostad, S.N., Khanavi, M., Hadjiakhoondi, A., Farahanikia, B., Salarytabar, A., 2013.
