      "text": "Serbia also follows EU legis-lation. Laws on Medicines in Macedonia and Serbia are harmonized with the EU regulation of medicines.Macedonia follows EU legislation for food supple-ments. The products are regulated by the special require-ments for safety of food supplements from 2012 (Official Gazzette of Republic of Serbia no. 45/10, 27/11; 50/12), and the Rulebook amending the Rulebook on special re-quirements for food supplements from 2013 and 2015 (Of-ficial Gazzette of Republic of Serbia, no. 41/13), and in compliance with the Croatian Rulebook on food supple-ments in terms of their classification from 2013. Serbia also follows EU legislation, but has not implemented and do not follow the Regulation on nutrition and health claims, novel food regulation procedures and the law on using symbols on packaging and packaging waste. For food supplements, indications and properties that are not possessed should not be attributed (Dzeparoski, 2013; Kotler, 1989; Kotler and Keler, 2009). The main goal of this paper was to make comparative analysis of advertising and promotion of the product Sen-tis by the company Bionika Pharmaceuticals in Macedonia and Serbia. The marketing campaigns, TV spots and inter-net advertisement have been analyzed. The choice of the countries is based upon different product categorization in which Sentis is classified.Materials and methodsComparative method for analyzing the regulation, ad-vertising and promotion of the food supplements and tradi-tional herbal medicines was used.Results and discussionCase studySentis is a natural sedative in the form of soft gela-tin capsules containing 200 mg of extract of valerian root (Valeriana Officinalis). In Macedonia Sentis is registered in 2012 as traditional herbal medicine (THM), while in Serbia is registered as a food supplement in 2013. Valeri-an root has been used since ancient times before the exis-tence of synthetic sedatives. The action is due to valeren-ic acid; experimental pharmacological studies have shown that it reduces motility, causing hypnotic activity, offset-ting the effect of caffeine and improves coordination. In both countries registered indications are temporary relieve of the symptoms of nervous tension, stress and insomnia. Benefits are unlike synthetic sedatives, it does not cause drowsiness and dependence (Bionika, 2013; PDR, 2007; WHO, 1999).The differences regarding dosing and indications, re-sulting from the different classification of the same prod-uct are as follows:- dosing registered as THM in Macedonia is 4 x 200 mg, while as food supplement in Serbia maximum daily dose is decreased to 2 x 200 mg;- -indications are the same in both countries, ex-cept that in Macedonia additionally is registered the sedative effect. S2 PP 75168Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 167 - 168 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsThese differences concern advertising and promotion-al activities. In Macedonia and Serbia same package in green and stylized cubist design of flowers and brain with minimal-istic look is used. The text on the package and the patient leaflets are different in accordance with the categoriza-tion, in correlation with the specific regulation. For THM it is written clearly that it is medicine without prescription, with specific 6 line content structure of the patient leaflet and indications based on traditional use. For the food sup-plement is clearly stated that the product is food supple-ment and also ingredients, nutrition and energetic values must be printed on the package, whereas the leaflet and claims are not obligatory. In Serbia the food supplement Sentis is sold with leaflet which contains claims.Internet is universal and powerful digital marketing tool in promotion of company products, including compa-ny web-sites. The content of websites also varies in differ-ent countries.Promotional materials are with similar text content and same design in both countries, except the statement that it is THM or food supplement. The other difference for the THM is also that \"the patient leaflet should be read, for more information you should consult your pharmacist or doctor\". The last is valid for all forms of advertisement. TV spot for Sentis as THM has been approved for ad-vertising in electronic media to the general public by the Ministry of Health. The message which should remain in the subconscious of the audience is that when you use Sen-tis the life will be without anxiety, stress, carefree, without worries and the consumer will continue on with life. TV spot for Sentis as food supplement in Serbia is from infor-mative character. It is not necessary approval for advertis-ing, because is based on generally accepted scientific data and they are comprehensible to the average consumer. In Serbia should be submitted for approval only health claims for reducing the risk of disease. The message which should remain in the subconscious of the audience is that it is a natural product for healthy people, which if used will help reduce certain symptoms. Except promoting the product, with both advertise-ments is also promoted the new pharmaceutical company. TV advertising in Macedonia with a strong and distinctive message, along with the promotion activities, helped the company to achieve significant market share in this seg-ment. Marketing of products by companies should be in accordance with the current country regulation for specif-ic product category.ConclusionThere are major differences in the marketing of THM/OTC and food supplements. All promotional materials for THM to the general public are subject to approval by reg-ulatory bodies, based on the approved summary of product characteristics and patient leaflet. The marketing of food supplements is more liberal in advertising and in Serbia is not subject to approval, if based on generally accepted sci-entific data. Macedonia follows the EU Regulation on nu-trition and health claims for food supplements. The results of the case study can also be used for preparation of mar-keting materials for other products on other markets of in-terest with similar regulation.

This technique differs from the conventional techniques such as HPLC and GC, because the essential component is the sampling interface. That allows for fast, non-destructive measurement of materials with little or no sample preparation. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is used for identification on every container that has been delivered. The principle is based on the comparison of the spectral data of the substance with the spectral data of several samples, which are present in a spectral reference library. These samples have positive chemical/physical and microbiological test analysis, tested in accordance with producer Certificate of Analysis and producer Drug Master File. Positive identification of these samples originally is confirmed with IR Spectrophotometry or other specific identification method. Besides others parameters, these analyses include testing of loss on drying, content of water, optical rotation, related substances and assay that may cause of variables in the NIR spectra. According to the \"Guideline on the use of NIR spectroscopy by the pharmaceutical industry and the data requirements for new submission and variations\" issued by the European Medicine Agency, when NIR procedures are used for qualitative analysis should be validated for a minimum specificity and robustness (EMA, 2009). For the specificity, independent set of samples is created of different batches, which are not included in the creating of the reference library. All of the samples should be approved correctly (pass). The reference library should be also challenged with relevant structural analogues, which should be rejected (fail). As for robustness, the effects of relevant variables should be understood, tested and documented. Some of the variables include: environmental temperature, humidity, different probe depth, different packaging material, changes in the instrumental method, for example the number of scans. Also instrumental variation can be consider, e.g. changing lamps or reflectance material.Materials and methodsThe NIRS analyses were performed on Thermo Antaris II FT-NIR Analyzer. It is dedicated FT-NIR analyzer designed specifically for use in the industrial environments of the pharmaceutical, food and beverages, chemical and polymer industries (Hirsch, 2008). Some of the characteristics of the instrument are: the detection is performed on high - sensitive, high - stable matched InGaAs; the light source is long - life, high intensity halogen NIR source; the interferometer is frictionless stable, long - life Michelson. The sampling method used is Fiber Optic. NIRS sampling by fiber optics allows rapid point-of-use QC for raw material identification. The Antaris II Fiber Optic module can be used with the SabIR hand - held diffuse reflectance probe which can analyze samples directly or indirectly through packaging materials. The spectral range of SabIR Probe is 12000 - 4000 cm-1. The probe shaft is made of stainless steel, and the window material of the shaft is made is made of high quality, chemical resistance sapphire according to the instrument specification (Antaris II FT-NIR Analyzer).The method that is used in Alkaloid is with SabIR Fiber Optic module. The spectral range in which the collecting is performed is 10000 - 4000 cm-1. The number of scans in 30, and the resolution is 8 cm-1.In the first step of creating the reference library, NIR S2 PP 76170Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 169 - 170 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsspectrum of Ibuprofen Lysine Reference standard was collected. Due to lack of certified reference standard from pharmacopoeia, in - house standard sent from the suitable manufacturer was used. Further the library was continually updated with samples of commercial batches of Ibuprofen lysine received from the manufacturer.The spectral reference library is composed of spectra collected with direct scanning of the substance and indirect scanning (through the polyethylene bag). In routine, indirect scanning is preferred, by reason of faster scanning and not requiring opening every package. The NIR method for identification of Ibuprofen lysine was validated in terms of Specificity and Robustness, according to the Guideline on the use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) by the pharmaceutical industry and the data requirement for the new submissions and variations, issued by the European Medicine Agency.Results and discussionVerification workflows are created for performance the following tests of specificity and robustness. These workflows are chosen for verification of the production workflow for Ibuprofen lysine.Verification workflow for performing specificityOne verification workflow that contains independent set of three samples, which are batches not included in the reference library are included is created. The results for these samples are PASS. The other verification workflow has three different substances that have similar structure with Ibuprofen Lysine, and therefore is expected to have similar NIR spectrum. That is Ibuprofen, the difference is with the Lysine group; Ketoprofen, belongs to the same group of Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; Paracetamol, together with Ketoprofen, they have similar structure. The result for Ibuprofen Lysine is PASS, and for the other three substances is FAIL.Verification workflow for robustnessRobustness is performed for testing the effect of minor changes to normal operating conditions on the analysis (Tang, 2012). Verification workflows are created for performance these tests. The parameters for validation robustness of the method, which can affect the method in our operating environment, are the following: change in the number of scans (performed only with indirectly scanning), change in probe depth (performed with direct scanning) and change in thickness of the packaging material (performed with indirect scanning). The results for these three workflow are PASS, which brings the conclusion that certain changes in the method does not affect the test results. ConclusionThe obtained results confirm that the NIR method for identification of Ibuprofen lysine is verified and appropriate for it use. ReferencesEuropean Medicines Agency, 2009.

Trajkovska, Hristina Babunovska Alkaloid AD - Skopje, Pharmaceutical, chemical and Cosmetics Company, Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* mspasevska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionResidual solvents in pharmaceuticals are defined as organic volatile chemicals that are used or produced in the manufacture of drug substances or excipients, or in the preparation of drug products. The solvents are not completely removed by the manufacturing techniques and therefore it is required appropriate selection of the solvent for the synthesis. The solvent used can enhance the yield, or even determine some of the characteristic of the substances, such as crystal form, purity and solubility (CHMP, 2015). Considering that residual solvents do not provide any therapeutically benefits, they should be removed, to the extent possible, to meet ingredient and product specifications and good manufacturing practices. The residual solvents, based on their toxicity, are divided into three groups. The solvents that are known to cause unacceptable toxicities are class 1. In this group belongs: benzene, carbon tetrachloride; 1,2-dichlorethane; 1,1 - dichlorethene and 1,1,1-trichlorethane. These solvents are proven human carcinogens and environmental hazardous. Considering the unacceptable toxicity, this class of solvents should be avoided during the manufacturing process, unless their use can be strongly justified in a risk-benefit assessment. The Class 2 solvents are associated with less severe toxicity. Some of the solvents that belong to this group are: acetonitrile; chloroform; 1,2-dichlorethene; N,N-dimethylacetamide; N,N-dimethylformamide; 1,4-dioxane; ethylene glycol; formamide; methanol; hexane; pyridine; toluene. The use of these solvents should be limited in order to protect the patients from potential adverse effects. Ideally, less toxic solvents should be used where is possible. Those are solvents that belong to Class 3. They are counted as less toxic and of lower risk to human health then Class 1 and Class 2 residual solvents. The solvents in this class are not known as a human health hazard at level normally accepted in pharmaceuticals. However there are no long-term toxicity or carcinogenicity studies for many of the residual solvents in Class 3. Available data so far, indicate that they are less toxic in acute or short term studies and negative in genotoxicity studies. Some of the solvents that belong to this group are: acetic acid; acetone; 1-butanol; 2-butanol; dimethyl sulfoxide; ethanol; ethyl acetate; ethyl ether; formic acid (USP, 2015).Residual solvent that was used in the synthesis of sodium citrate is methanol. Since methanol belongs to class 2 residual solvents, quantification should be performed. Materials and methodsThe experiments were performed on Shimadzu 2010 Plus GC instrument. The pressure was set to 9.8 Psi, column flow was 2.08 mL/min and total flow was 15.5 mL/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas. Other gases that were used are Hydrogen and Air. The injection volume was 1000 uL and the split was 1:5. The column used is DB-624, 30 m x 0.32 mm, 1.8 um (Agilent). Methanol standard was supplied from Merck Darmstad (Shimazdu, 2013).The methanol standard solution was prepared in final concertation of 150 ppm."
