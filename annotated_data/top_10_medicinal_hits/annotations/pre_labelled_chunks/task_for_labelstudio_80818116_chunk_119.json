      "text": "The oil composition affects the ex-act position of the band for the C-H stretching of the cis-double bond, and yields higher-frequency shift when the oil has higher content of polyunsaturated acyl groups (Vla-chos et al., 2006). Furthermore, the ratio of the absorbance of the bands responsible for the C-H stretching of the cis-double bonds and the asymmetric C-H stretching the meth-ylene bonds could be used for quantitative estimation of the degree of unsaturation (Vlachos et al., 2006). In the ATR-IR spectra of the extracts of Capsicum annuum the band for the C-H stretching of the cis-double bond typical for vegetable oils rich in linoleic acid, such as soybean and corn oil, was found at 3009 cm-1. According to the ratio of the absorbance at 3009 and 2923 cm-1, the highest degree of unsaturation was found for the seed extracts. Also, the ATR-IR technique provides a fast and reliable identifica-tion of capsaicinoids in Capsicum annuum extracts. The typical frequencies of the amide C=O stretching and am-ide N-H bending vibration of capsaicin do not overlap with the IR bands of triglycerides, and therefore allow identifi-cation of capsaicinoids even at low concentrations. Among the studied extracts, those obtained from placenta had the highest content of capsaicinoids. However, for exact deter-mination of the capsaicinoids content a calibration curve based on a series of standard mixtures with known amount of triglycerides and capsaicin is required.ConclusionExtracts from the pericarp, placenta, seeds, and stalk of red hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L., ssp. microcar-pum longum conoides, convar. Horgoshka) were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy. It was shown that both spec-tral techniques provide useful information on the triglycer-ide content and degree of unsaturation of the red hot pep-per extracts. The IR spectroscopy could serve as a fast tool for identification of capsaicinoids in the extracts, while the NMR analysis could be successfully applied for determi-nation of the proportion tryglycerides:capsaicinoids.ReferencesBarison, A., Pereira da Silva, C.W., Campos, F.R., Simonelli, F., Lenz, C.A., Ferreira, A.G., 2010.

Macedonia* viktorija.maksimova@ugd.edu.mkIntroductionIn the last few decades, capsaicin has exerted potent anti-cancer properties by enouncing anti-proliferative, apoptotic and anti-metastatic activity. To the best of our knowledge, the specific cell targets and successive mech-anism of cytotoxic activity of capsaicin in different type of malignant cells, still remains unclear and contradictory. Therefore, this mini review, explains some of the most sig-nificant chemopreventive mechanisms of the action of cap-saicin at a cellular level, reported in the recent literature. The specific cytotoxic activity of capsaicin is usually a result of targeting of capsaicin toward two aims: TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1) and tumor associated NADPH-oxidase. Some researchers reported that capsaicin provokes its anticancer activity through the interaction with TRPV1 receptor (Kim et al., 2006). Amantini et al., (2007) reported that capsaicin elicits apoptosis in U373 glioma cells, because the TRPV1 receptor was highly expressed and oppositely the cytotox-ic effect in U87 cell line in which the TRPV1 receptor was very low expressed, capsaicin did not show cytotoxic ef-fects (Amantini et al., 2007). Hu et al., (2008) have shown that TRPV1 receptor is included in capsaicin induced Ca2+ influx, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), depo-larization of the mitochondrial membrane, and ultimately cell death on the synovial fibroblasts in rats. On the other side, capsaicin is one of the molecules which could inhib-it the activity of tumor associated NADPH-oxidase, which is related to the inhibition of proliferation of cancer cells (Hedges et al., 2003). The ability of capsaicin to inhibit the growth of differ-ent cancer cells is primary mediated by its ability to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis represents a type of programmed cell death, which is one of the physiological mechanisms for maintaining the homeostasis in the organism. It has been reported that two different pathways are mainly mediating the process of activation of apoptosis. First one is extrinsic pathway which is accomplished by activating of the \"death receptor\", and the other is intrinsic pathway which is fol-lowed by activation of cascade of caspase enzymes (Chou et al., 2007). Extrinsic pathwayThe extrinsic mechanism of apoptosis is characterized by activation of the external cell surface receptors, name-ly TRAIL (Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) and DR (death receptor, Fas/CD95), lead-ing to downstream caspase-mediated apoptosis (Codesido et al., 2014). These receptors can be activated by a signal that activates the enzymes procaspase 8 and 3, and there-fore consequently triggers the apoptosis of cells. The num-ber of studies, which included the extrinsic pathway into the mechanism of capsaicin mediated apoptosis, is much lower than numbers of reported studies which indicated the intrinsic pathway as the main mechanism of apoptosis. Moon et al., 2012 notified that capsaicin induced the surface expression of TRAIL-receptor D5 through the acti-vation of SP1 due to a calcium influx-dependent SP1 (spe-cific protein 1) in kidney cancer cells. In multiple malig-nant glioma cells, subtoxic concentrations of capsaicin sensitized TRAIL-induced apoptosis mediated through ER Stress proteins CHOP/GADD153. DR5 and surviving con-tribute to amplification of the caspase cascade, thus restor-ing TRAIL sensitivity (Kim et al., 2010).

Disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and alterations in bcl-2, Bax, bcl-xL, and bad proteins, can cause a release of cytochrome C in cell cytosol and subse-quent activation of the caspase cascade. These processes are the initial triggers that are eventually leading to apop-tosis (Zhang et al., 2008). Cytochrom C together with some other factors can induce activation of caspase-9. Activated capsasa-9 can lead to activation of caspasa 3 and 7, which cleaves the inhibitor of caspasa activated DNAase and re-sults in DNA fragmentation. Many studies examining the cytotoxic effects of capsaicin on prostate and other malig-nant cell lines, have reported that capsaicin induced apop-tosis is linked to intrinsic mechanisms.Pramanik et al., (2011) have evaluated the mechanism of capsaicin-mediated ROS generation in pancreatic can-cer cells and they suggested that mitochondrial complex-I and III are involved in capsaicin mediated ROS gener-ation. They demonstrated that capsaicin inhibited the en-zymatic activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dis-mutase (SOD), catalase and glutathione reductase, which resulted in oxidative stress. According to Kryston et al., (2011), the agonistic ef-fect of capsaicin on TRPV1, can evoke intracellular in-flux of calcium, which leads to further intracellular stress, activating apoptosis in various cell lines, namely prostate cancer. They found that the generation of ROS induced by capsaicin correlated with the dissipation of the inner mito-chondrial transmembrane potential and the release of cy-tochrome-c into the cytosol. Activation of the caspase-3 cascade resulted in the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)poly-merase (PARP) and resultant apoptosis. Conclusion A large number of investigators clearly demonstrated that capsaicin inhibits the growth of cancer cells by induc-ing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, but its molecular mech-anisms in some types of cancers are not well understood. Therefore, additional studies are required to elucidate and to supplement the missing part of this data.ReferencesAmantini, C., Mosca, M., Nabissi, M., Lucciarini, R., Caprodossi, S., Arcella, A., Giangaspero, F., Santoni, G., 2007.

This paper presents the results obtained by Quality Control division of Pharmanova, during the qualification and selection process of raw material suppliers. The requirement specified for the quality of the extract used in Oestrofact E capsules is: at least 40% of total isoflavones, calculated on a dried basis. After reviewing the official scientific literature, the testing of samples, sent by the manufacturers/suppliers was performed. Monographs for the herbal drug (Powdered Red Clover), herbal extract (Powdered Red Clover Extract) and final product (Red Clover Tablets), that were consulted, have been published by the U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP36/NF31, 2013). The monograph for Powdered Red Clover Extract states the isoflavone content should be not less than 90% and not more than 110% of the declared amount, calculated on the dried basis as the sum of daidzein, genistein, formononetin and biochanin A content.Materials and methodsTest samples of red clover dry extracts with appropri-ate documentation (specifications, certificates, production flow charts) were collected from three manufacturers. The samples were tested for the individual content of each iso-flavone (daidzein, genistein, formononetin and biochanin A) as well as the total isoflavone content."
