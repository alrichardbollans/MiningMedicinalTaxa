Therefore, the identification of newtherapeutic strategies is of great importance. Since ancient times, frankincense isused in traditional medicine for the treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders suchas rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, the present study intends to evaluate if Casperome R(c)(Casp), an orally bioavailable soy lecithin-based formulation of standardized frankincenseextract, is able to ameliorate systemic effects and organ damages induced by severesystemic inflammation using a murine model of sepsis, i.e., intraperitoneal administrationof lipopolysaccharides (LPS).Methods: Male 60-day-old mice were assigned to six treatment groups: (1) control,(2) LPS, (3) soy lecithin (blank lecithin without frankincense extract), (4) Casp, (5) soylecithin plus LPS, or (6) Casp plus LPS. Soy lecithin and Casp were given 3 h priorto LPS treatment; 24 h after LPS administration, animals were sacrificed and healthstatus and serum cytokine levels were evaluated. Additionally, parameters representingliver damage or liver function and indicating oxidative stress in different organs weredetermined. Furthermore, markers for apoptosis and immune cell redistribution wereassessed by immunohistochemistry in liver and spleen.Results: LPS treatment caused a decrease in body temperature, blood glucose levels,liver glycogen content, and biotransformation capacity along with an increase in serumcytokine levels and oxidative stress in various organs. Additionally, apoptotic processeswere increased in spleen besides a pronounced immune cell infiltration in both liverand spleen. Pretreatment with Casp significantly improved health status, blood glucosevalues, and body temperature of the animals, while serum levels of pro-inflammatorycytokines and oxidative stress in all organs tested were significantly diminished. Finally,apoptotic processes in spleen, liver glycogen loss, and immune cell infiltration in liverand spleen were distinctly reduced. Casp also appears to induce various cytochromeFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387121fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 2Loeser et al. Casperome R(c) in Systemic InflammationP450 isoforms, thus causing re-establishment of liver biotransformation capacity in LPS-treated mice.Conclusion: Casp displayed anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and hepatoprotectiveeffects. Thus, orally bioavailable frankincense extracts may serve as a new supportivetreatment option in acute systemic inflammation and accompanied liver dysfunction.Keywords: frankincense, lipopolysaccharides, systemic inflammation, cytokines, oxidative stress, liver functionINTRODUCTIONDespite recent advances in critical care, sepsis, septic shock, andsubsequent multi-organ failure remain an important cause ofmorbidity and mortality in intensive care units (Engel et al.,2007; Martin, 2012; Gaieski et al., 2013). About 20-25% ofpatients with sepsis and associated organ failure display earlyimpaired liver function, which in severe cases can result in acuteliver failure (Kramer et al., 2007; Koch et al., 2011; Nesseleret al., 2012; Horvatits et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2014). Such liverdysfunction seems to be mediated to a considerable extent bypro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-8 thatare liberated by resident macrophages of the liver, the so-calledKupffer cells (Nesseler et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2014). Moreover,it has been shown that the severity of liver damage (even morethan the impairment of lung or kidney function) is of majorconsequence for overall patient outcome (Kramer et al., 2007;Koch et al., 2011; Nesseler et al., 2012; Horvatits et al., 2013; Yanet al., 2014). However, although extensive research efforts havebeen made, no specific therapy exists so far for the treatment ofsepsis and of sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (Nesseler et al.,2012; Horvatits et al., 2013). Therefore, the identification of newtherapeutic strategies is of great clinical importance (Yan et al.,2014).Extracts of frankincense gum resins from different Boswelliaspecies have been used for centuries in traditional medicine,e.g., in Indian Ayurveda medicine, in China, and in severalAfrican countries, to treat infectious diseases and chronicinflammatory disorders. But also in Europe, frankincenseextracts are commonly and increasingly used, and severalclinical trials have been conducted to demonstrate theirtherapeutic benefit (Abdel-Tawab et al., 2011). Recent datafrom both animal experiments and clinical trials revealedthat gum resin extracts from Boswellia species not only exertbeneficial effects in various inflammatory conditions such as, e.g.,rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn'sdisease, multiple sclerosis, or bronchial asthma, but also inhyperlipidemia, obesity, and cancer (see e.g., Poeckel and Werz,2006; Moussaieff and Mechoulam, 2009; Abdel-Tawab et al.,Abbreviations: ALAT, alanine aminotransferase; BROD, benzyloxyresorufin-O-debenzylation; b.wt., body weight; Casp, Casperome R(c); CD, clusterof differentiation; COX, cyclooxygenase; CSS, clinical severity score;CYP, cytochrome P450; ECOD, ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylation; EMND,ethylmorphine-N-demethylation; EROD, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation; GSH,reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; IL, interleukin; iNOS, induciblenitric oxide synthase; LPO, lipid peroxides; LPS, lipopolysaccharides; MROD,methoxyresorufin-O-demethylation; NO, nitric oxide; Phyto, soy lecithin;PROD, pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylation; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactivesubstances; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.2011; Du et al., 2015; Sturner et al., 2017). Additionally, in2002 the European Medicines Agency classified Boswellia serrataextract as an \"orphan drug\" for the treatment of peritumoralbrain edema. The main active principles of these extracts arepentacyclic triterpenes, termed boswellic acids, which are uniqueto Boswellia species (Ammon, 2006). Among others, there arefour important b-configurated boswellic acid derivatives: 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-b-boswellic acid (AKBA), 3-O-acetyl-b-boswellicacid (AbBA), 11-keto-b-boswellic acid (KBA), and b-boswellicacid (b-BA).The exact molecular basis for the pharmacological actionsof boswellic acids in chronic inflammatory conditions stillremains to be resolved. As possible target structures microsomalprostaglandin E2 synthase-1, 5-lipoxygenase, human leukocyteelastase, cathepsin G, topoisomerase I and II, as well as membersof the IkB kinase/NFkB and MAPK signaling pathways have beenidentified (Syrovets et al., 2005; Poeckel and Werz, 2006; Takadaet al., 2006; Cuaz-Perolin et al., 2008; Moussaieff and Mechoulam,2009; Siemoneit et al., 2009, 2011; Ammon, 2010; Abdel-Tawabet al., 2011). Additionally, using precipitation experiments withimmobilized boswellic acids, LPS has recently been identified as apossible direct molecular interaction partner of distinct boswellicacids and their synthetic derivatives (Henkel et al., 2012). Theauthors were also able to show that distinct boswellic acids areable to inhibit LPS-mediated effects in a series of cell-basedassays via direct binding to LPS. The experiments revealed clear-cut structure-activity relationships and b-BA was found to bethe most potent derivative. These findings are further supportedby the fact that boswellic acids as well as frankincense resinextracts reduce LPS-induced NO and proinflammatory cytokineproduction in macrophages both in vitro and in vivo (Syrovetset al., 2000; Pandey et al., 2005; Gayathri et al., 2007; Sharmaet al., 2016), thereby exerting hepato- and renoprotective effects(Pandey et al., 2005).To the best of our knowledge, neither individual boswellicacids nor frankincense extracts have been evaluated for theireffects in acute systemic inflammatory conditions before.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigatefor the first time the impact of Casp, an orally bioavailablesoy lecithin-based delivery form of standardized frankincenseextract, in a murine model of acute systemic inflammation,i.e., the intraperitoneal administration of LPS. The LPS modelwas chosen based on the assumption of a direct interactionbetween boswellic acids, especially b-BA and LPS (Henkelet al., 2012). Additionally, in comparison to other sepsis animalmodels such as peritoneal contamination and infection with(human) stool bacteria (PCI) or cecal ligation and puncture(CLP), the LPS model has several essential advantages suchFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 387122fphar-09-00387 April 18, 2018 Time: 17:27 # 3Loeser et al. Casperome R(c) in Systemic Inflammationas technical ease and high reproducibility (Seemann et al.,2017; Stortz et al., 2017). Furthermore, the LPS model hasbeen proven to be most suitable for studying effects of newtherapies on acute systemic inflammation (Seemann et al.,2017). Casp is composed of Boswellia serrata extract and soylecithin in a 1:1 ratio, with about half part of microcrystallinecellulose added to improve physical stability. The formulationis standardized to contain >=25% of triterpenoic acids byHPLC. Compared with poorly bioavailable non-formulatedfrankincense extracts, Casp provides a quicker absorption aswell as considerably higher plasma and tissue levels of themost important boswellic acids, including b-BA (Husch et al.,2013; Riva et al., 2016). Since in rats maximum plasma levelswere reached after 180 min (Husch et al., 2013), in thepresent study Casp was administered to the mice 3 h beforeLPS challenge; 24 h after LPS administration, animals of thedifferent treatment groups (soy lecithin alone; Casp alone; soylecithin plus LPS; Casp plus LPS) were evaluated in comparisonto control mice and to LPS-only-treated animals with regardto general condition, body temperature, blood glucose values,and serum cytokine concentrations."
