The collecting, processing and applying plants and plant-based products is present through generations in this region. Ethnobotanical research was done as a survey which included 104 interviewed people (58 women and 46 men) coming from 3 settlements with 45 small quarters. Semi-structured anonymous ethnobotanical interviews were used. Most respondents were between 50 and 80 years of age (70.18%). The fruits of roses are used primary for human nutrition (tea - 100%, marmalade - 67.30%, juice - 15.38%, wine - 0.96%). Also interesting is the fact that only one person uses a leaf of wild rose to make tea. It was determined that the most common conditions treated with these plants are colds (99.03%) and in nutrition (68.26%), against diarrhea (15.38%), dry cough (8.65%), stomachache and as a diuretic (2.88%).The ethnopharmacological study showed the immense importance of medicinal and nutrition importance of species from Rosa genus in the daily life of a local community.Acknowledgment: The authors thank the Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development for financial support (Grant No 173029).www.ethnopharmacology2021.org156Formulation of natural products and medicinal plants from traditional to modern phytotherapeuticsPosters20th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSFormulation of natural products and medicinal plants from traditional to modern phytotherapeuticsP050. Anti-inflammatory activity of Ocimum gratissimum: from traditional health practice to a modern phytotherapeutic gel formulation.D.H. Mahdi1,2, W. Bio'Ngoye1, Z. Vissiennon1, V. Ahyi1, C. Vissiennon2,31 IRGIB Africa University, Inter-Regional University of Industrial Engineering Biotechnologies and Applied Sciences, Cotonou, Benin.2 Leipzig University, Medical Faculty, Institute of Medical Physics and Biophysics, Germany.3 Repha GmbH Biologische Arzneimittel, Langenhagen, Germany.Ocimum gratissimum, Lamiaceae commonly known as 'tchiayo' in Benin, has been reported in several ethnopharmacological surveys as a plant widely used in traditional medicine for a variety of ailments including inflammatory conditions and readily accessible to the communities for its medicinal and nutritional values [1]. Aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of Ocimum gratissimum (OG) in activated human monocyte-derived macrophages (THP-1). Furthermore, a formulation of a novel herbal anti-inflammatory gel containing OG extract was designed in order to develop a prototype for a potential modern phytotherapeutical product. The effect of the ethanolic OG leaves extract (90% V/V) collected in Cotonou, Benin was evaluated on LPS-induced cytokine (TNFa and CXCL13)-release from differentiated human macrophages (THP-1). Production of the pro-inflammatory mediators (TNFa and CXCL-13) was measured by ELISA and IC50 values were determined. Budesonide served as positive control and cytotoxicity controls were performed using MTT assay. The herbal gel formulation was designed by using carbopol 980, OG leaves extract (1%), baobab oil, shea butter, beeswax and distilled water. The skin pH (6.8-7) was maintained by drop wise addition of tri-ethanolamine. The physicochemical parameters of formulations (pH, homogeneity, viscosity, spreadability etc.) were determined. It was found that the production of TNFa (IC50: 71.82 mg/mL) and CXCL-13 (IC50: 8.71 mg/mL) was inhibited after treatment with OG extract. These effects were concentration-dependent and comparable to those of budesonide. Moreover, no alteration of cell viability was observed in the applied concentrations. The herbal gel prototype showed good homogeneity, good spreadability, good stability and no skin irritation. The results obtained reinforce the relevance of the traditional medicinal uses of OG and provides further information on its anti-inflammatory potential. Further studies will focus on the topical anti-inflammatory activity of the novel herbal gel formulation for the treatment of skin irritations.

Innovative electrospun PHB scaffolds as carriers for the wound healing agents Alkannins and Shikonins.K. Giannakoula1, A. Arampatzis1,2, K. Tsioptsias1, K. Kontogiannopoulos1,2, V. Papageorgiou1,2, A. Assimopoulou1,2, I. Tsivintzelis11 Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, School of Chemical Engineering, Greece2 Center of Interdisciplinary Research and Innovation of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Natural Products Research Centre of Excellence (NatPro-AUTH), GreeceAmong the different materials used for biomedical applications and especially those intended for skin replacement, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have attracted great interest in recent years mainly due to their non-toxic nature. One of the most common types belonging to PHA family is poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB); a highly biocompatible, biodegradable and low-cost material that serves as an appealing candidate for various medical devices, such as tissue engineering scaffolds and wound dressings. The bioactive secondary metabolites Alkannins and Shikonins (A/S) are naturally occurring hydroxynaphthoquinones biosynthesized in the roots of several Boraginaceous plants. These molecules have been established in the contemporary pharmacopeia in Greece by our group as strong wound healing agents in several approved medicines (HELIXDERM(r), Histoplastin Red(r)), while the first reports being traced back in the works of Hippocrates and Dioscorides. Since then a plethora of important biological properties have been well established, such as anticancer and regenerative ones. The aim of this work was to study for the first time the electrospinning of PHB fiber mats incorporated with a mixture of A/S pigments. Specifically, A/S-loaded and non-loaded electrospun PHB scaffolds were successfully fabricated using several polymer and drug concentrations. Scanning electron microscopy of the PHB fiber mats proved the formation of a uniform mesh with diameters ranging from 1.3-1.5 mm. The entrapment efficiency of A/S was confirmed by UV-Vis spectrophotometry and ranged between 52.6% and 92.6%, while the 72h in vitro release study of A/S in phosphate-buffered solution revealed that 82.6-91.5% of the entrapped drug released. Overall, these preliminary results seem promising, dictating the need for follow-up experiments aiming to develop an efficient drug release system for repairing and regenerating skin.Acknowledgements: This study was supported by the project \"MICROMETABOLITE\" that has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No721635.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 15920th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSFormulation of natural products and medicinal plants from traditional to modern phytotherapeuticsP052. Natural deep eutectic solvents: an eco-friendly alternative for the extraction of naphthoquinones from Alkanna tinctoria roots.E. Bossard, N. Tsafantakis, N. Aligiannis, N FokialakisDepartment of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, GreecePlant derived natural products have an important role in pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical and food supplements industries. Their increasing demand is leading to the over-exploitation of plant resources and to the over-consumption of organic solvents, widely recognized to be of great environmental concern. For this reason, the design of green extraction methods of natural products is currently a key research topic. [1-3] In order to address this issue, eco-friendly natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) were used instead of organic solvents for the extraction of naphthoquinones from the roots of Alkanna tinctoria Tausch, a plant from Boraginaceae family. More than sixty NADESs containing choline chloride-, and betaine-, as hydrogen bond acceptor combined with different hydrogen bond donors (sugars, organics acids) were investigated for their potential to extract this particular class of compounds. As a result of the statistical evaluation, the most relevant deep eutectic mixture with the highest extraction efficiency was found to be composed of levulinic acid and glucose (LeG). The optimum levulinic acid-glucose ratio and the water content were investigated via a single-factor experiment. With a ratio of 4:1 (w/w), and 30% of water (w/w), LeG had a high extraction yield to naphthoquinones. A further optimization step of extraction parameters was followed using response surface methodology (RSM), including the solid-to-solvent ratio, extraction temperature, extraction time as well as the application of solid phase extraction techniques for the recovery of the naphtoquinone fraction from the NADES extraction solution. Our results revealed the optimized LeG mixture as a valid green alternative for the extraction of naphthoquinones from Alkanna tinctoria.

Naphthoquinone rich extract of root bark of Onosma echioides upregulates the elastin and collagen gene in human dermal fibroblast and the formulation thereof heal burn wound in rats by upregulating VEGF gene.J. Pananchery, C. GadgoliDepartment of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Saraswathi Vidya Bhavan's College of Pharmacy, Dombivli, Maharashtra, IndiaThe objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of dye in expression of collagen and elastin gene in Human dermal fibroblasts and VEGF in healed burn wound model in wistar rats. The red dye was extracted from the dried root bark of Onosma echioides using petroleum ether (60-80oC). The marker compound 1,4-naphthoquinone dimer was isolated and the extract was standardized using HPTLC. Cytotoxicity of the extract was determined in Human Dermal Fibroblast (HDF) cell line through MTT assay. The effect of standardized extract on expression of elastin and collagen genes in HDF was evaluated at various concentrations using RT-PCR technique. The wound healing effect of formulation of the standardized extract was carried out in burn model in wistar rats. The healing potential was evaluated through expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Cytotoxic concentration for the pet. ether extract of O.echioides against HDF was not found as 50% inhibition (IC50) was more than 400 ppm. Extract of O.echioides showed concentration dependent upregulation of collagen and elastin genes. Gene expression study of VEGF in formulation of O. echioides showed increased values as compared to placebo and control. The folklore uses of Onosma echioides for healing of wounds is justified through upregulation of collagen and elastin required for synthesis of collagen and elastin fibres in stage 3 of wound healing in HDF and upregulation of VEGF gene in burn wound created in rats.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 16120th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSFormulation of natural products and medicinal plants from traditional to modern phytotherapeuticsP054. Evaluation of wound healing efficacy of phytosomal gel of Onosma echioides in wistar rats.C. Gadgoli, J. PanancheryDepartment of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemistry, Saraswathi Vidya Bhavan's College of Pharmacy, Kalyan-Shil Road, Dombivli, Maharashtra, IndiaOnosma echioides yields red colour dye, indicated presence of 1,4- naphthoquinones and is used for treatment of wounds in folklore medicine. However, the formulation of the same is not available. Hence the objective was to prepare standardized formulation and evaluate wound healing efficacy of petroleum ether extract of root bark of Onosma echioides in Wistar rats. Pet Ether extract of dried root bark of O. echioides was standardized by isolated naphthoquinone dimer using HPTLC. Phytosomes of the standardized extract were prepared by thin film hydration technique. The wound healing efficacy of the formulation was evaluated in rats by inflicting excision and incision wounds. The healing was evaluated by determination of breaking strength and tensile strength of healed skin for incision model and percentage wound contraction, hydroxyproline content, granulation tissue free radicals (lipid peroxidation), catalase in excision wound model. The formulation was applied to wounds topically.The formulation treated group showed a significant increase (p<0.005) in mean breaking strength when compared to control group. The phytosomal treated groups significantly (p<0.001) promoted wound contraction as compared to control group. Significant increase in hydroxyproline content (p<0.0001), collagen turnover (p<0.0005) and catalase activity (p<0.0001), as compared with control group. Granulation tissue free radical (Lipid peroxidase) decreased significantly in phytosomal treated group (p<0.0006) when compared with control group. Histopathological studies of the formulation treated groups also revealed the effectiveness in improved wound healing. Conclusion: The phytosomal gel of O.echioides effectively exhibited wound healing effect. Thus, proving the healing potential of novel drug delivery system with improved stability.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org162Greek EthnopharmacologyPosters20th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP055.
