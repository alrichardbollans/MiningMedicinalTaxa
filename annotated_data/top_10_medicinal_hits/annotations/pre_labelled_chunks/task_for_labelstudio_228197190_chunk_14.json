      "text": "With the migration of people from around the world, they have brought with them their own medicines and remedies to the UK, something which HCPs should be aware of and have some insight into (Dogra et al., 2005). There are risks and benefits of consuming HMs which HCPs need to recognise, especially if their patients are consuming products which they consider to be natural and therefore safe (Ipsos MORI, 2008). HCPs are at the forefront of primary care and need to be well equipped with the correct knowledge and training on HMs. It is not feasible for HCPs to advise patients about HMs if the background knowledge is lacking (Pokladnikova and Lie, 2008). 3.4.4 Taking Herbal Medicines alongside Western Medicines There may be several reasons why people try or use HMs in addition to CWM, including: the traditional use of HMs passed through generations, dissatisfaction with CWM, a desire to take control of their own health by making their own decisions, and curiosity to try natural and holistic therapies (Doel and Segrott 2003; Clarke et al., 2004). Furthermore, people may use HMs when CWM do not appear to be working, or to treat and manage the side effects of CWM; this is commonly seen in cancer patients having chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Sawyer et al., 1994; Ernst and Cassileth, 1998). In developing countries the high cost of pharmaceutical medicines, hospitals and medical facilities means the use of HMs is popular, as they may be a cheaper alternative (WHO, 2000). However, in the UK where medicines and treatment is often free on the National Health Service (NHS) taking HMs may actually be more expensive. During the SATMED questionnaires distribution there were mixed views about taking HMs with regards to the financial cost; some participants said they were not interested in using HMs as they had to pay for them but got their prescription medicines for free. While others mentioned it was expensive to buy ingredients for HMs in the UK but it was cheaper to bring them back from countries like India and Pakistan. The import of HMs from foreign countries leads to further risks such as contamination, adulteration, and misidentification of species (Chapter 4). HCPs views of combining THM with CWM are more likely to be determined by evidence based research and clinical guidelines, rather than the test of time (Heinrich, 2015). Awodele et al. (2012) disclosed that 41% (n = 123) of respondents in their survey to explore doctors view of THM, thought THM were effective for treating chronic conditions; although, none 91 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra of the doctors believed that THM alone could treat a patient. A comparison of UK and German general practitioners (GPs) attitudes towards CAM was done by Schmidt et al. (2002); they found GPs from both countries generally had a positive attitude towards CAM, although the Germans were more positive. GPs from the UK commonly referred patients for acupuncture, osteopathy and chiropractic treatment; while, significantly more German GPs referred their patients to herbal medicines. In the UK there is limited research to explore what HCPs think about combining HMs with CWM; this is an area which needs to be investigated further. There is a growing concern of serious interactions occurring between HMs and prescribed or over-the-counter CWM (Vickers et al., 2006). Smallwood (2005) says there is a risk of people not taking their CWM correctly or as prescribed if they use HMs. Vickers et al. (2006) found participants did not think it was important to tell their doctors about their use of HMs as they did not think they interacted or affected one another. The Ipsos MORI report (2008) revealed that 66% of participants thought it was safe to take HMs at the same time as CWM. The notion that HMs are natural and therefore safe misleads people to think HMs are safe and free from deleterious effects (Howells, 1996; Staines, 2011). Eisenberg et al. (1998) claim 60-70% of CAM users do not discuss it with their doctors, meaning patients will not get the opportunity to learn about the potential risks and interactions of combining HMs and CWM (Schmidt et al., 2002; Graham et al., 2008). If HCPs are not aware that their patients are taking HMs alongside CWM they will not be able to intervene, or identify potential adverse effects and interactions (Heinrich, 2015). Furthermore, it may affect the appropriate pharmaceutical care plan from being implemented which may cause further complications to the patients' health (Ramsay et al., 2005). Potential Herb-Drug Interactions Polypharmacy is the term used to describe the simultaneous consumption of several medicines by one person (Duerden et al., 2013). Multiple medicines may need to be taken to control or treat health problems, in which case there is always the possibility for drug interactions to occur. The definition of a drug interaction is, \"when the effects of one drug are changed by the presence of another drug, herbal medicine, food, drink or by some environmental chemical agent,\" (Baxter, 2008). Dureden et al. (2013) highlights that polypharmacy can be harmful due to the increased risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and impaired medication adherence if prescribed too many medicines. For CWM before any drug is licensed for use it undergoes rigorous testing, providing evidence for its clinical use. Details of potential drug interactions are also documented in several sources such as the 92 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra British National Formulary (BNF) and Stockley's Drug Interactions, which HCPs have access to. Various studies have found between 20-33% of the population use some form of CAM either alone or in addition to CWM (Freymann et al., 2006). Polypharmacy with CWM alone can be hazardous; but, by adding HMs it could further complicate the consequences. A herb-drug interaction is when the effect of a drug is altered by herbal products. Herb-drug interactions are based on the same principles of pharmacokinetics (i.e. affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination) and pharmacodynamics (i.e. drugs effects are mimicked or antagonised) as with conventional drug interactions (Chavez et al., 2006). Cytochrome (CYP) P450 are a group of enzymes which metabolise a variety of substrates and have an important role in drug metabolism. Enzyme-inducing herbals render drugs ineffective at sub-therapeutic levels as they are metabolised too fast. Alternatively when herbal products inhibit or reduce the rate of enzyme activity drugs will be metabolised slower than anticipated; this can cause the drug to accumulate and cause toxicity. Drug accumulation can be a serious problem especially for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, such as digoxin (Colalto, 2010). One of the most well-known herbal products which affects the CYP 3A4 isoenzyme, is St John's Wort (SJW) (Hypericum perforatum L.); it acts as an enzyme inducer which reduces the plasma concentration of certain drugs including carbamazepine (anti-epileptic), ciclosporin (immunosuppressant), statins and oral contraceptives (Komoroski et al., 2005; Graham et al., 2008). Hyperforin one of the active constituents in SJW induces P-glycoproteins in the intestinal wall reduces drug absorption. Furthermore, if taken with Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) a type of antidepressant such as citalopram or sertraline, it can cause serotonin syndrome; where the levels of serotonin become so high in the body that it can have fatal consequences (Chavez et al., 2006; Williamson et al., 2013). Fugh-Berman and Ernst, (2001) conducted a systematic review to explore the interactions between herbs and conventional drugs. They found that warfarin, a coumarin anti-coagulant, had the most interactions. Products such as garlic, gingko, ginseng, and even excessive consumption of green leafy vegetables can alter the anti-coagulant effects of warfarin (Chevallier, 2007). The mechanisms of how such interactions occur are not always understood or clinically significant; sometimes isolated reports of an interaction are the only indication of a potential interaction (Williamson et al., 2013). Warfarin is commonly initiated in patients who may have an increased risk of blood clotting, a history of a heart attack or stroke, or with prosthetic heart valves. It prevents the blood from clotting by inhibiting the conversion of hepatic vitamin K-dependent factors which reduce the amount of prothrombin produced; thus, reduces the rate of coagulation (Chavez et al., 2006). Foods which are high in vitamin K such as: cranberry juice, raisins, kiwi fruit, soya beans, 93 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra blackberries, blueberries, broccoli, and kale should be avoided by people taking warfarin (Fay, 2009). Despite being part of a healthy diet such products could affect the dose of warfarin required to have a therapeutic effect. It is very difficult to establish interactions between HMs and CWM as they are not frequently reported (Chavez et al., 2006). This may be because people who use HMs and HCPs lack the knowledge of herb-drug interactions (Vickers et al., 2006; Staines, 2011). In addition, if HCPs are not aware of patients taking HMs they cannot intervene or identify potential interactions (Heinrich, 2015). Communication between patients and their HCPs about HMs is vital to be able to identify potential herb-drug interactions and adverse effects from HMs (Vickers et al., 2006). The incidence of interactions between HMs and CWM is not fully known, and currently there is no way of establishing potential problems or clinical outcomes (Williamson et al., 2013). The main way of monitoring the safety of HMs is via the MHRA, which set up the yellow card scheme (Barnes, 2003; MHRA, 2014a). Publications such as Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions (Williamson et al., 2013) and Phytopharmacy - An Evidence Based Guide To Herbal Medicinal Products (Edwards et al., 2015) could be essential in educating HCPs about potential herb-drug interactions; however, unlike the BNF and Stockley's Drug Interactions such texts are not readily available for HCPs to access. 3.4.5 Using Social Media to Conduct Scientific Research The internet was made available to the public in 1991 with the introduction of the World Wide Web (WWW), which revolutionised how people learn, share information, and communicate (Vance et al., 2009). In the year 2000 just 26.8% of the UK population had access to the internet, in 2014 this had increased to 89.9% (Internet Live Stats, n.d). The launch of social media websites and applications such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube have increased the ease and speed of communication; social media may be used for social, leisure, or professional communications. An Ofcom report in 2013 estimated that 82% of the UK population aged over 16 had access to the internet, of which 53% used social media websites (Ofcom, 2013). For researchers this presents exciting opportunities to conduct research as it can be used as a valuable tool to identify and recruit participants (Beninger et al., 2014); which can lead to a snowball sample for exploratory work (Bhutta, 2012). With the rise in popularity and access to social media, Murphy et al. (2013) claim that researchers should look into new ways to engage respondents and capitalise on this evolving phenomenon. 94 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra State public health departments have also adopted the use of social media to share information and health promotion updates with the public (Thakeray et al., 2012), they have used Facebook and Twitter as a way of communicating with the general public and YouTube channels to help promote health awareness. The NHS UK has over 87 thousand followers on Twitter, while the Department of Health UK have over 161 thousand followers (Twitter, 2015); the followers were comprised of a mixture of HCPs and the general public. A study by Valdez et al. (2014) explored the benefits and challenges of recruiting for research studies related to consumer health information technology using Facebook. The study was composed of two phases which aimed to recruit specific populations: the first targeted a particular ethnic group (Filipino-American) and the second focused on type two diabetics. They posted messages on target groups and pages, and also sent private messages to administrators and people within the groups to recruit them for their research. They found that using social media structures such as Facebook was good for small samples providing qualitative data; but not so good for large samples for quantitative research. On the other hand, Bhutta (2012) used her personal Facebook networks and obtained over 4000 completed surveys for her research within one month. Valdez et al. (2014) highlight the importance of creating trust and transparency to successfully recruit participants. There are several advantages of conducting research using social media; it is a fast and efficient way of spreading a message, and getting instant feedback and replies (Sutton, 2010). Traditional methods of recruiting a sample can be time consuming and costly (Valdez et al., 2014). By using social media a large research sample can be recruited from different regions and even countries, allowing cross-cultural perspectives to be explored (Woodfield et al., 2013). It provides anonymity for participants who may not wish to disclose their personal details or identity, as they do not necessarily have to have any contact with the researchers (Beninger et al., 2014). In addition, as there is no facilitator present it eliminates the effects of researcher bias and may also give participants the freedom to express their views more open and honestly. It is cheaper than traditional research methods which may require printing and postage costs; in some cases it may even be free to set up an online survey. Once the research method, e.g. survey or focus group, is established it is easy to distribute the link to the survey and data can be collected quickly (Vance et al., 2009). There is an increasing number of people who have remote access to social media via multiple channels, e.g. smart mobile phones, netbooks, laptops, and tablets (Ofcom, 2013); therefore, online surveys can be completed quickly and instantly whilst on the go. Finally, as the data is collected electronically it reduces the risks of data input errors and is easier to analyse and store (Woodfield et al., 2013). 95 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra In spite of all the benefits of using social media to conduct research, there are also some disadvantages including: poor response rate, incomplete surveys, and the lack of control of the research population (i.e. cannot be sure of who is participating). This could be a particular problem if a specific research population is required but people who do not fall within the inclusion criteria participate. As the research is conducted without any face-to-face contact it may be difficult to keep participants engaged throughout the entire process. If participants do not understand a question there is no way of clarifying it, which may lead to unanswered questions or participants dropping out. The initial cost of some online research tools may be expensive, for example the basic survey on SurveyMonkey, an online survey development software, is free; however, this only enables a maximum of ten multiple choice questions and one hundred responses. In order to create a full survey where respondents can also write comments and unlimited responses can be collected it can cost from PS229 per year (SurveyMonkey, 2014). Considering that just over 50% of British adults use social media it would mean a significant portion of potential participants are not included in the research (Woodfield et al., 2013). One of the main drawbacks of this type of research is that because it is a fairly new concept it is difficult to apply traditional ethical principles to (Beninger et al., 2014). The Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (DTB) conducted some research to explore what HCPs knew about HMs using online surveys. They emailed 1,157 subscribers to the DTB and had a response rate of 14.2% (n=164). The limitations of this research were that they had a low response rate, it only targeted HCPs who had subscribed to the DTB, and was limited to mainly doctors and clinicians rather than a variety of HCPs; thus, limiting the generalisability of the results. Despite this they did uncover some interesting results (DTB, 2010). Using social media to conduct research provides a unique opportunity to engage a diverse range of people from around the world in a study, quickly and efficiently. Enabling researchers the freedom to explore concepts in an innovative way and people to share their thoughts and perspectives on a subject they are interested in (Woodfield et al., 2013). Traditional research methods have been tried and tested; their long standing use has been refined and guidelines to conduct ethical, safe, reliable and valid data are widely available. Conversely, the use of social media for conducting scientific research is a relatively new phenomenon; any new research done this was will help to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of this research method. Scientists should be willing to move with advances in technology instead of sticking to traditional methods (Murphy et al., 2013). 96 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.5 Methodology The following section details the research methods used to conduct this study; describing the design of the questionnaire, the participant inclusion criteria, how the survey was distributed, the ethical approval process, and how anonymity and confidentiality were maintained. 3.5.1 Questionnaire Design In order to explore HCPs opinions and knowledge of HMs a questionnaire to meet the aims and objectives of this investigation was constructed (Appendix 6); with a combination of open and closed questions to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data. It was designed to be an online, self-completion questionnaire, giving participants the flexibility to complete the survey in their own time (Moore, 2000). An introductory statement was created to advise participants on the purpose of the research and inclusion criteria (Appendix 7). Brent (2014) claims the more questions you ask the less time participants spend on each question. It was important to keep the questionnaire concise as it was anticipated that participants may be deterred from a lengthy survey."
