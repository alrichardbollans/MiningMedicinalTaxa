Other dominant phenolics were luteolin,epicatechin, and rosmarinic acid in these extracts. However,the most abundant phenolics in the water extract were benzoicacid and quercetin. In recent studies, the detected phenolics inO. natrix extracts possess a broad range of biological activitiesincluding antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial and enzymeinhibitory (Lopez-Lazaro, 2009; Amoah et al., 2016; David et al.,2016). In this framework, the observed biological activities forO. natrix extracts might be explained with the presence of thesephenolic components. To the best of our knowledge, this studyis the first report which indicates comprehensive analysis ofphenolic constituents of O. natrix. In this sense, the presentfindings could be opened new horizons for the genus Ononis andit' usages.Antioxidant CapacityIn order to evaluate antioxidant ability of O. natrix extracts,several methods were performed: free radical scavenging(DPPH and ABTS), reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP),phosphomolybdenum and metal chelating assays. DPPH andABTS assays are widely utilized to examine radical scavengingactivities of plant extracts or synthetics. These assays are basedon the reduction of ABTS+ and DPPH* in the presence ofantioxidants and the changes (from blue to white in ABTS;from purple to yellow in DPPH) can spectrophotometrically berecorded. In addition, the assays reflect to hydrogen donatingabilities of antioxidants. As shown in Table 3, the methanol andwater extracts had similar DPPH scavenging abilities whereas thelowest ability was observed in the ethyl acetate extract. However,ABTS radical scavenging abilities can be ranked as ethyl acetate>Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600323Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicamethanol>water. The apparent differences can be attributedto nature of these radicals (ABTS assay is considered as bothhydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant systems, while DPPH isonly hydrophobic systems). Our findings are consistent withprevious results, which were reported different results for DPPHand ABTS (Kim et al., 2002; Zengin et al., 2015, 2017; Bouhlaliet al., 2017).Reducing power is an important way in the antioxidantmechanisms and it reflects electron-donating abilities ofantioxidants. From this point, CUPRAC and FRAP assays wereperformed to detect reducing abilities of O. natrix extracts(Table 5). By using CUPRAC assay (from Cu2+ to Cu), the ethylacetate extract showed the strongest reducing ability, followedby methanol and water extracts. These results are in line withthe total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Nevertheless, theFRAP (from Fe3+ to Fe2+) abilities decreased in that orderwater (106.12 mgTE/g extract)>ethyl acetate (90.71 mgTE/gextract)>methanol (79.73 mgTE/g extract). This finding forwater extract in FRAP assay might be related to complexinteractions of phytochemical (antagonistic etc.) described asPena-Cerda et al. (2017) and (Hmid et al., 2017).Phosphomolybdenum assays is proposed by Prieto et al. (1999), which is based on the reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V)by the antioxidants and then a green phosphate/Mo (V) complexoccurs at the acidic pH. The assay is also considered as one oftotal antioxidant capacity assays. Within O. natrix extracts, themethanol extract (1.53 mmolTE/g extract) exerted the strongestability in phosphomolybdenum assay, followed by ethyl acetate(1.27 mmolTE/g extract) and water (1.13 mmolTE/g extract)extracts (Table 4). In the literature, several researchers reporteddifferent approaches for a correlation between total phenolic andthe reduction of Mo (VI) to Mo (V) (Albayrak et al., 2010; Kocaket al., 2016; Amessis-Ouchemoukh et al., 2017). At this point, thisactivity for the methanol extract may be related to the presence ofother antioxidants as well as phenolics.Transition metal ions, such as iron and copper are involved inthe production of hydroxyl radical via Fenton and Haber-Weissreactions. In this sense, the metal chelating ability is consideredas an important way in the antioxidant mechanisms. Contraryto expectations, the metal chelating ability significantly differsfrom other antioxidant assays and the strongest activity wasobserved in water extract with 14.49 mgEDTAE/g, while the ethylacetate extract had the lowest ability (Table 5). These findings areconsistent with previous studies, which reported no correlationbetween total phenolic and metal chelating ability (Silva et al.,2011; Hatami et al., 2014; Khorasani Esmaeili et al., 2015). Infact, the metal chelating abilities of phenolics were described asa minor way in theirs antioxidant properties by Rice-Evans et al. (1996).Enzyme Inhibitory EffectAlzheimer's diseases (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) areconsidered as major public health problems and their incidencetends to increase at an alarming rate (more than 35.6 millionAD patients in worldwide and is expected to be more than100 million AD patients by 2050). The development of newtherapeutic approaches (also in terms of non-pharmacologicaltherapy supplement) for these diseases has become a pressingissue. Among the therapeutic approaches, the inhibition ofkey enzymes is considered as one of most effective strategy(Wimo and Prince, 2010). Cholinesterase inhibitors are currentlyused as a drug for the treatment of AD. The inhibitorsincrease brain acetylcholine (ACh) levels by preventing thebreakdown of ACh and this case is very important tocognitive function (Menichini et al., 2014). Again, a-amylaseand a-glucosidase release glucose from larger carbohydrates(especially starch) and are key enzymes in DM glucose levelcontrol (Kubinova et al., 2014). In this direction, both a-amylase and a-glucosidase inhibitors are promising drugs inthe treatment of DM. In addition, tyrosinase is a main enzymein the synthesis of melanin and thus tyrosinase inhibitorsare useful for controlling hyperpigmentation problems. Withinthe framework of these information's, many enzyme inhibitorsare synthetically produced. However, most of them showlimited effectiveness especially related to side effects, such asgastrointestinal disturbances, and toxic properties (Kumar et al.,2011). Therefore, many scientists have focused on naturallyoccurring compounds from plants as potential sources of eithernew or safe effective inhibitors.Thus, we tested enzyme inhibitory effects of Ononis extractsagainst to cholinesterases, tyrosinase, amylase and glucosidase.The results are represented in Table 6. The ethyl acetate extractexhibited the strongest cholinesterase inhibitory effect on bothAChE (1.46 mgGALAE/g extract) and BChE (0.93 mgGALAE/gextract). However, the water extract was not active on BChE.The observed activity for ethyl acetate extract may be linkedto higher level of phenolics in the extracts. Our findings wereconfirmed by several researchers (Kennedy andWightman, 2011;Roseiro et al., 2012; Mazlan et al., 2013; Hlila et al., 2015),who reported a linear correlation between phenolic contentand anti-cholinesterase abilities. Interestingly, the ethyl acetateextract did not have any inhibitory effect on tyrosinase and theTABLE 5 | Total antioxidant capacity (phosphomolybdenum assay), reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP assays) and metal chelating activities of the extracts.Extracts Phosphomolybdenum (mmolTE/g extract) CUPRAC (mgTE/g extract) FRAP (mgTE/g extract) Metal chelating (mgEDTAE/g extract)Ethyl acetate 1.27 +- 0.07* 183.37 +- 0.02 90.71 +- 1.79 9.16 +- 0.17Methanol 1.53 +- 0.08 170.51 +- 0.57 79.73 +- 1.17 12.02 +- 1.40Water 1.13 +- 0.03 94.16 +- 0.99 106.12 +- 0.44 14.49 +- 0.64TE, trolox equivalents; EDTAE, EDTA equivalents. *Values expressed are means +- S.D. of three parallel measurements.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600324Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicawater extract had remarkable anti-tyrosinase effect with 52.81mgKAE/g extract. As for amylase and glucosidase inhibition, theethyl acetate (0.74 mmolACAE/g and 17.52 mmolACAE/g) andmethanol extracts (0.59 mmolACAE/g and 19.94 mmolACAE/g)had the greatest abilities compared to water extract. The higherconcentrations of phenolics in these extracts may be responsiblefor their anti-diabetic effects. In accordance with our findings,some phenolic components were reported as anti-diabetic agents(Tundis et al., 2010; Etxeberria et al., 2012; Rios et al., 2015).From this point, molecular approaches could be valuable tounderstand interactions of enzymes and phenolics.

A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicasubsp. hispanica. Taken together, this study could provide astarting point on this species and could open new perspectivesfor designing novel functional products.Molecular DockingEvidence from the literature supports the inhibitory action ofapigenin on AChE and BChE (Katalinic' et al., 2010; Xie et al.,2014). Apigenin was also reported to induce moderate inhibitoryeffect on a-amylase (Li et al., 2014; Wulan et al., 2014) and ona-glucosidase. On the other hand, we have found that the waterextract possesses good inhibition activity toward tyrosinase. Thismay be attributed to the presence of luteolin and quercetin.In light of the observed inhibitory activity, in silico moleculardocking simulation was used to investigate the interactionsbetween apigenin to AChE, BChE, amylase and glucosidase,whereas luteolin and quercetin have been selected as principalFIGURE 4 | Best pose of (A) luteolin and (B) quercetin docked to tyrosinase.FIGURE 5 | percentage of DNA protection analysis and gel view of plasmid DNA protection test for each Ononis natrix extracts.
