The rawcrystal structures were prepared for the docking experiments asFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600320Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicapreviously reported (Mocan et al., 2016; Uysal et al., 2016). Non-catalytic water molecules, inhibitors and all the other moleculespresent in the pdb files were removed by using UCSF Chimera(DeLano, 2002) and the proteins alone were neutralized at pH7.4 by PropKa implemented in Maestro 10.2 suite (Maestro,2015). Seleno-cysteines and seleno-methionines, if present, wereconverted to cysteines and methionines, respectively. All themissing fragments and other errors present in the crystalstructures were automatically solved by the Wizard ProteinPreparation implemented in Maestro 10.2 suite (Maestro, 2015).Ligands Preparation(+)-Epicatechin, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin and rosmarinicacid were selected as representative compounds to carry outmolecular docking study, as these compounds were presentin abundance in the herbs extracts. The chemical structurethe selected compounds are reported in Figure 1. The threedimensional structures have been downloaded from Zincdatabases (Irwin et al., 2012) and used for molecular modelingexperiments after preparation. The ligands were prepared by theLigPrep tool embedded in Maestro 10.2, neutralized at pH 7.4 byIonizer and minimized by OPLS3 force field (Shelley et al., 2007).Molecular DockingDockings of the representative substances have been performedfor each selected enzyme employed for the in vitro enzymaticinhibition tests in this work. Glide embedded in the maestro suite10.2 has been employed for the docking calculations by usingthe \"eXtra Precision\" scoring function for all the enzymes andthe mm-GBSA binding energy has been calculated by the useof Prime embedded in maestro 10.2 (Table 1; Jones et al., 1997).In all cases, the binding pocket was determined automatically bycentering the grid on the crystallographic inhibitor, extended ina radius of 10 Angstroms from the center. The best pose for eachcompound docked to the selected enzymes was the best rankedamong the 10,000 generated.DNA ProtectionDNA protection activity of the studied extracts was analyzedusing pUC19 plasmid DNA (pDNA). Plasmid isolation wasperformed by Thermo Scientific Genejet Plasmid Miniprep Kit.The reaction mixture contained 5uL of Fenton's reagent (30mMH2O2, 50mM ascorbic acid, and 80mM FeCI3), 5 uL of theseextracts at two different concentrations (5 and 10 mg/mL) and3 uL of pDNA (300 ug/uL). Final volume of reaction mixturewas brought up to 20 uL using double-distilled water. Positivecontrol was composed of 12uL of distilled water, 5uL of Fenton'sreagent and 3uL of pDNA. Negative control involved only 17uLof distilled water and 3 uL of pDNA. Samples were incubated for30min at 37*C and 4 uL loading dye (Thermo Scientific, USA)was added to the all mixtures. The DNA mixtures were run on0.8% agarose gel and then visualized under ultraviolet light cabin.Biological replication of test was carried out at three times andband density was determined by the gel image analysis software(Quantum, Vision-Capt., Vilber Lourmat SAS, France) (Ozkanet al., 2015).Cytotoxic EvaluationCell Culture MaterialsHeLa and PC3 cancer cell lines were obtained from SelcukUniversity, Faculty of Science, and Department of Biochemistry.Penicillin/Streptomycin, EMEM cell culture media, Ham's F-12 cell culture media, Fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin, MTT,ethanol, 2-prophanol, 60 x 15 mm corning plates and 75 cm2FIGURE 1 | Chemical structure of apigenin, luteolin and quercetin.TABLE 1 | Binding energy and glide XP docking scores.Compounds AChE* BChE* a-amylase* a-glucosidase* Tyrosinase*XP 1G XP 1G XP 1G XP 1G XP 1GApigenin -9.6 -60.6 -9.4 -52.5 -5.98 -35.2 -5.7 -17.2 -5.7 -26.1Benzoic A. -4.0 -14.2 -4.9 -22.3 -3.88 -0.03 -2.3 +71.8 -5.1 +41.7(-)-Epicat. -9.3 -41.5 -7.3 -41.0 -7.03 -38.1 -6.9 -21.8 -5.5 -20.9Luteolin -9.6 -52.9 -8.0 -53.3 -6.54 -54.0 -6.7 -30.3 -5.1 -29.3Quercetin -10.3 -62.9 -7.9 -43.5 -8.79 -52.9 -6.9 -31.2 -5.4 -28.3Rosmarinic A. -11.3 -64.5 -10.9 -42.8 -8.26 -46.8 -6.5 -22.6 -6.3 -12.2*1G values (Binding energy) are expressed in Kcal/mol.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600321Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicacorning flasks were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).Cell Culture MaintenanceCulture media were prepared with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep) solution. Preparedmedium was kept at +4*C and warmed at 37*C before using.Cells (HeLa, PC3) were proliferated in incubator (37*C including5% CO2). Stock cells were proliferated in 75 cm2 sterile corningflasks and experiment cell cultures were proliferated in 60 x 15mm sterile petri dishes. In the logarithmic phase of the growth(when reached to~80% cell confluency), cells were sub-cultured(Karakurt and Adali, 2016).Preparation of Plant ExtractionDilutions weremade to obtain extract concentration of 10mg/ml.The water extract was suspended in PBS and other extracts weresuspended in DMSO (Dimethylsulfoxide)/water (1:5) and thediluted extracts were centrifuged at 10,000x g during 2 min, andsupernatants were filtrated (having the diameter of 0.22 um poresize) and they were kept in-20*C.MTT Cell Viability TestA total of 10.000 PC3 and HeLa cells were seeded in 96-wellplates and allowed to fasten on the wells for 24 h. After 24 h,cells were treated with different doses of the tested extracts (0.1,1, 2.5, 5, and 10mg for water) (0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 ugfor ethyl acetate and methanol) for 24 h. After exposure timecompleted, the medium was changed with EMEM and Ham'sF12 medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS + 0.5 mg/ml MTTfor HeLa and PC3 cancer cells, respectively. Then, they wereincubated at 37*C with 5% CO2, for 4 h. After that time, the cellswere treated with 3% SDS+ 40 mMHCl/isopropanol for 15minin order to dissolve the MTT-formazan crystals (Yerlikaya et al.,2016). The absorbance of each sample was recorded at 570 nm.Cell survival rate was calculated by using GraphPad Prism 3.03software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).Antimicrobial ActivityAntimicrobial activity test was performed by disc diffusionmethod. Nutrient agar mediumwas used for test microorganismsand microorganisms were refreshed in 100 mm sterile petridishes. Single colony of bacterial strain was inoculated in20ml nutrient broth medium for 24 h at 37*C incubator. Afterbacteria concentration was made visible in %9 sterile NaCIand its turbidity was standardized to 0.5 McFarland by addingbacterial suspension. Bacterial suspension seeded to 100mmpetri dishes. After the tested extracts were dissolved in DMSOand saturated on discs, they were incubated at room temperaturefor drying. They were placed on the inoculated petri plateswith microorganisms for 24 h at 37*C incubator. Test wasreplicated at least three times and results were analyzed bymeasuring inhibition zone. Microorganisms were illustrated onTable 2.Statistical AnalysisAll the assays were carried out in triplicate. The results wereexpressed as mean value and standard deviation (mean +-TABLE 2 | Microorganisms used for antimicrobial activity test.Microorganisms Gram (+) Gram (-)Klebsiella pneumonia XStaphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 XStaphylococcus hominis XProteus vulgaris XEscherichia coli XSerratia marcescens XStaphylococcus epidermidis XAlfa streptococcus haemolyticua XEnterococcus faecium XPseudomonas aeruginosa XListeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644 XEnterococcus durans XSalmonella kentucky XEnterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 XSD). Statistical differences between the extracts were analyzedby using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followedby Tukey's honestly significant difference post-hoc test (a =0.05). All the analysis was carried out using SPSS v22.0software.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPhytochemical CompositionIn the last decades, many studies highlighted biologicalactivities of phenolic compounds, such as antioxidant, anticancer,antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory. Flavonoids are the mostabundant group of phenolics and considered as natural bioactiveagents for designing novel functional products. In this sense,the amounts of total phenolics and flavonoids contents in O.natrix extracts were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu and AlCl3methods. The greatest content of total phenolics was noticed inthe ethyl acetate extract (60.19 mgGAE/g extract), followed bymethanol (59.22 mgGAE/g extract) and water (35.12 mgGAE/gextract) extracts. Similar results were observed for flavonoidas well (Table 3). These findings were confirmed by severalresearchers who reported the higher concentration of totalphenolics in ethyl acetate and methanol extracts (Do et al.,2014; Murugan and Parimelazhagan, 2014). In a previous study(Mhamdi et al., 2015), the total phenolic content of O. natrixin Tunisia was reported as 51 mgGAE/g, which was lower thanthat found in the present study. Moreover, some researcherswere found to be different levels of total phenolics in severalOnonis species, such as O. spinosa (3.09 mgGAE/g extract)(Orhan et al., 2012), O. pubescens (17.23 mgGAE/g extract), andO. ornithopodioides (20.96 mgGAE/g extract) (Sarikurkcu et al.,2016).Individual phenolic constituents in the tested extracts wereanalyzed by HPLC-DAD and the results are given in Table 4.A total of 23 standard phenolics were used and 21 of themwere identified in these extracts. Two compounds (rutin andhesperidin) were not detected in the extracts. Apigenin wasFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 600322Yerlikaya et al.
