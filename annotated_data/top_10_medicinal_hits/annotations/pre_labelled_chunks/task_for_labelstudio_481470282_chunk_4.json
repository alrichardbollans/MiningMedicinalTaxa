The average interval between cancer diagnosis and TCM consultation was 15.3 months. The most common cancer type was breast cancer in adjunctive TCM users (19.4%), and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in non-TCM users (13.6%). A total of 33.1% of adjunctive TCM users visited TCM clinics more than 9 times per year. Overall, adjunctive TCM users had a lower adjusted hazard ratio for mortality (aHR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.68-0.70) compared with those non-TCM users. For leukemia, we conducted a laboratory investigation and clinical trial on Sheng-Yu-Tang to prove its efficacy. For nasopharyngeal carcinoma, we have also shown the prescribed CHM, Gan-Lu-Yin, is effective against tumor in vitro and in a tumor-bearing murine model. This study provides an overview of complementary TCM usage among cancer patients in Taiwan.

Ethnopharmacological investigations of Vietnamese medicinal plants used for the treatment of inflammation and cancer.H. Thi Tran, T. Thanh Nguyen, N. Kretschmer, E.-M. Pferschy-Wenzig, R. BauerInstitute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Graz, AustriaVietnam is very rich in traditional medicinal knowledge and still 80% of the population is using it in the primary health care system. In our ongoing research on plants used for the treatment of inflammation and cancer, we have recently screened and investigated a series of Vietnamese plants with high activity.From Helicteres hirsuta we isolated the new natural product 4,4'- Sulfinyl - bis - (2-(tert-butyl)-5-methylphenol, as well as 7-O-methylisoscutellarein, 3b-O-acetylbetulinic acid, and simiarenol, which were found in Sterculiaceae for the first time. 4,4'- sulfinyl - bis - (2-(tert-butyl)-5-methylphenol and 3b-O-acetylbetulinic acid showed cytotoxicity in CCRE-CEM and HCT-116 cancer cells [1].From Enhydra fluctuans, the known sesquiterpene lactones enhydrin, fluctuanin, and fluctuadin showed significant cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines and a normal lung fibroblast cell line.Four sesquiterpene derivatives were also isolated from the rhizomes of Stahlianthus involucratus, including the two new natural products 5-hydroperoxylacorafuran and isoacotatarone C, plus the known tatarinowin B and tatarinowin C. Besides tatarinowin C, all showed cytotoxicity. Sphaeranthus africanus has been used in traditional Vietnamese medicine to treat sore throat, and to relieve pain and swelling. A series of carvotacetones from this plant that displayed cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines and showed anti-inflammatory effects. [2,3]. 3-angeloyloxy-5-angeloyloxy-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, 3-angeloyloxy-5-[2?,3?-epoxy-2?-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, 3-angeloyloxy-5-[3?-chloro-2?-hydroxy-2?-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, 3-tigloyloxy-5-angeloyloxy-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, 3-angeloyloxy-5-hydroxy-7-hydroxycarvotacetone were identified together with two diastereomeric carvotacetones (3-angeloyloxy-5-[2>>S,3>>R-dihydroxy-2>>-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone and 3-angeloyloxy-5-[2>>R,3>>R-dihydroxy-2>>-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, asperglaucide, and chrysoplenol D. Some of them showed very potent anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects with IC50 values in the nM and low uM range.Our findings support the traditional medical application of these plants and their potential for drug lead discovery.

Reverse pharmacology and traditional medicine.B. GrazFoundation Antenna, Geneva, SwitzerlandIn the conventional process of discovering treatments that could be widely recommended, clinical studies are conducted after several years of preclinical research. There is however, a faster track: the approach called reverse pharmacology (or bedside-to-bench). For traditional medicines, population surveys on therapeutic activities and correlation with reported clinical outcome (Retrospective Treatment Outcome -- RTO) can help select treatments with good safety profile and indices of effectiveness, hence accelerate eventual clinical validation.The reverse pharmacology approach has four steps: After an RTO survey, the second step is a dose-response study with humans; the third step evaluates effectiveness through a clinical trial. The fourth step are laboratory studies, which in this case, and contrary to classical drug discovery, are thus post-clinical.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org4020th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL04. Innovative strategies for the efficient isolation of natural products and discovery of potential new leads.E.F. Queiroz, JL. WolfenderInstitut des Sciences Pharmaceutiques de Suisse Occidentale (ISPSO), Section des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Universite de Geneve, SwitzerlandNatural products (NPs) have been a source of inspiration for drug development throughout history. Nature continues to represent a rich source of new molecules with interesting pharmacological properties that could be used as lead compounds for the development of new drugs. Technological development in this field is constantly evolving. New high-throughput screening strategies have been introduced for rapid and efficient evaluation the biological and chemical potential of complex matrices, such as plant extracts. Significant advances in molecular biology afford now the development of more predictable in vitro and in vivo bioassays. The combination of metabolite profiling using molecular networks and bioassays gives the possibility to distinguish between already known bioactive compounds and new molecules directly in crude natural extracts (dereplication)[1] Thus, the targeted isolation of new bioactive products or constituents presenting novel or unusual spectroscopic features can be undertaken. The structural identification of new NPs requires only very small amounts of material (sub milligram) using such approaches. On the other hand, the extensive bioactivity profile characterization of a potential lead requires milligram or tens of milligram amounts. In this case, preparative chromatographic methods for the purification of NPs at large scale are mandatory. At this level, significant improvements for the efficient targeted isolation of given NPs through chromatographic gradient transfer methods have been made [2,3]. The applications, possibilities and limitations of these latest technologies applied to the study plant and fungal metabolites will be illustrated with recent investigations performed in our laboratory.

The Regulatory aspects and challenges for commercialisation of the Natural Products.N. LallPlant and Soil Sciences, University of Pretoria, South AfricaTraditional medicine is an important foundation upon which modern medicine has been built. In these traditional practices, plants have been a crucial resource, owing to their abundance since the dawn of mankind. In modern times, synthetic drugs have become a lucrative alternative; however, plants as a resource remain the indispensable resource from which even synthetic alternatives are derived. Recently, natural medicines have shown increased popularity, not surprisingly when considering the benefits. By combining the knowledge derived from traditional medicinal practices with modern science, the possibilities for drug discovery and use of plants in the treatment of a wide array of conditions seems endless.South Africa has a wealthy supply of plants (about 23 500 species of higher plants) together with a high degree of endemicity (36.6%) in the indigenous South African flora, of which 4000 plant taxa are ethnomedicinally used and approximately 500 species are used in traditional medicine by an estimated 70% South Africans on a regular basis. South Africa has huge potential for identifying novel compounds to treat many diseases. South African plants for various purposes such as infectious diseases, cancer, skin-hyperpigmentation problems, melasma, Periodontal diseases, and for acne problem have been scientifically investigated. Steady progress in evaluating potential medicinal plants for product development with potential in human medicine has been made. Once the medicinal products are developed, the dynamics of various ways for benefitting the people who have been using plants for centuries, will be discussed in the talk.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org4220th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL06. Exploration of Traditional Herbal Knowledge in the South Balkan and East Mediterranean region for the discovery of bioactive natural products.N. AligiannisDepartment of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, GreeceThe geographical and ecological characteristics of the Balkan Peninsula and Mediterranean Sea, along with the historical connection among ethnic groups living in the area, gave rise to the development of a distinct flora and to the uses of common medicinal plants against various ailments. Over the past twenty years, our research group obtain evidence on the importance of collecting, assessing and exploring ethnopharmacological data for the discovery of bioactive natural compounds. As examples, the study of Nicander's \"Theriaca\", verified the use of several plants to treat bite symptoms from venomous animals and information obtained from semi-structured interviews for the wound healing properties of Ficus carica preparations were verified by in-vivo mouse model applications. In parallel, the establishment of a validated analytical chemometrics approach through the elaboration of contemporary chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques (FCPC, HPTLC, LC-HRMS/MS, NMR) along with sophisticated statistical algorithms for the rapid and effective identification of bioactive compounds, prior to their isolation directed us to the development of PEGASUS platform.The aforementioned efforts led tOo join forces with Balkan countries and coordinate the European project EthnoHERBS (H2020-MSCA-RISE) for the sustainable and effective exploitation of SE European traditional knowledge and biodiversity for the development of innovative products based on natural ingredients. Within the scope of project, all ethnobotanical studies from Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Italia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia, Serbia, Turkey were assessed for archiving in a database herbal preparations used for skin ailments. The aim is to provide an overview of the ethnobotanical knowledge of medicinal plants and traditional medical practices for the treatment of skin disorders in the South Balkan and East Mediterranean region. Initially, the research was focused in Albania, Cyprus, Greece and Turkey. Literature study of ethnobotanical surveys showed that 948 taxa belonging to 417 different genera and 111 different families are used in the treatment of skin related problems. The majority of the plants belong to the families of Asteraceae (11.0%), Lamiaceae (8.5%), Rosaceae (7.1%), Plantaginaceae (4.5%) and Malvaceae (3.5%). Their usage is internal (decoction, infusion etc. ), or external (compress, poultice, ointment etc.) to treat skin related ailments such as wounds. In order to relate this ethnopharmacological knowledge and trace its expansion and diversification through centuries, a comparison of findings was made with the use of the medicinal species mentioned in Dioscorides' \"De Materia Medica\" for skin disorders. This work constitutes the first comparative study performed with ethnobotanical data for skin ailments gathered in the South Balkan and East Mediterranean area. Our findings confirm the primary hypothesis that people in Albania, Cyprus, Greece and Turkey are close related in terms of traditionally using folk medicinal practices. Nevertheless, more field studies conducted, especially in remote places of these regions, can help preserve the traditional medical knowledge, aiming at the discovery of new phytotherapeutics against dermatological diseases.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 4320th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL07. TCM needs TQM: New applications using NMR for standardizing botanical mixtures.R. CooperThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR ChinaThere is a need to improve and promote the scientific inquiry on the study and use of botanicals, natural products and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), in order to secure global acceptance. Although there is an enormous history of use of botanical medicines a better understanding of these preparations and formulae within the scientific and international community and a rigorous process is needed. The aim is to study select botanicals and natural products to provide scientific data used for standardization and substantiation of health claims using Total Quality Management (TQM). For example, active compounds found in the botanical extract of the Traditional Chinese Medicine, Sambucus williamsii Hance exhibit protective effects on trabecular bone mass and mechanical strength of cortical bone of ovariectomized rats. The main bioactive compounds were determined as lignan compounds. A novel approach was adapted to standardize and determine quantities of the lignan content in the aqueous alcoholic extract of Sambucus williamsii using spectroscopic methods and provide data to help meet the registration requirements. Using these data, the lignan amount in the extract was calculated. The application of this simple and reliable method can be used to estimate other compound families in complex mixtures or botanical extracts and herbal medicines.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org4420th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL08. Challenges and success in using plants to control internal parasites in animals.JN. EloffPhytomedicine Programme, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, South AfricaHaemonchus contortus is a nematode causing extensive losses in sheep production especially in tropical countries. Strong resistance has developed against current control agents. These agents are expensive or unavailable to poor rural farmers. Rural pastoralists have use many plant extracts to control this parasite. In contrast to external parasites where it is easy to see the efficacy of treatments, it is not easy to see the efficacy of plant extracts with internal parasites. It is possible to collect eggs of the parasite from faeces and keep it alive long enough to determine the treatment effect on egg hatching and on larval development. Because the biological assay is demanding it is not feasible to carry out random screening of large number of plants. It is also not easy to isolate the bioactive molecule(s). Using ethnoveterinary data is the only practical option. Much work has been done in this field. In some cases, the objective was to support traditional use and in other cases it was to find compounds that could be used as nematicidals. Benzimidazoles are active against fungi and nematodes. Some antifungal compounds may also be active against nematodes. It is relatively easy to screen plants for antifungal activity and isolate antifungal compounds that may be active against nematodes. The positive and negative results found with these two approaches will be discussed. The work eventually led to the isolation of agrimol G from Leucosidea sericea leaves with good activity against Haemonchus contortus. Based on electron microscopical studies it has a different mechanism of activity than ivermectin and albendazole, two commercially used nematicidals. The controversy around using ivermectin against the Corona virus will also be discussed.Adamu M, et al."
