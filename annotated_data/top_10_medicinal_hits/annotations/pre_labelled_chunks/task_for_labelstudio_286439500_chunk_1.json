The authors have identified 52 compoundsby LC-MS analysis and showed that H. hircinum subsp.majus infusion exerted broad antifungal activity againstAspergillus, Penicillium, and non-albicans Candida strains(Tocci et al. ).Ethnobotany has played an important role in new drugdevelopment and drug discovery (Kayser, 2018). The importanceof the traditional use of medicinal plants on the Greek islands ofthe North Aegean Region was summarized in a Brief ResearchReport Article by Axiotis et al. In this report the authors present109 wild plants from 52 families, and enlist their therapeutic uses,including uses in galenic preparations which were reported bylocal medical doctors and pharmacists (Axiotis et al. ).Medicinal plants and natural products are of potentialimportance in several age-related disorders, including memoryimpairment and dementia (Tewari et al., 2018). In this researchtopic Dimpfel et al. assessed the biological activity of somecommercial extracts of the underground parts of Rhodiola roseaL. and its analytical markers, salidroside and rosavin, using long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in hippocampus slices(a synaptic model of memory).Loeser et al. evaluated the effect of Casperome R(c), an orallybioavailable soy lecithin-based formulation of standardizedfrankincense extract on various systemic parameters and organdamages that were induced by severe systemic inflammationcaused by intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharides(a murine model of sepsis). The study revealed that the extractpossesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and hepatoprotectiveeffects (Loeser et al. ).Zielin'ska et al. review older and recent data on pharmacology,phytochemistry, and clinical studies of Chelidonium majus L.along with controversies about this herb, its safety, and drugquality issues.The study of Wozniak et al. evaluated the effects ofphytochemically characterized extracts of various parts oftraditionally used Syringa vulgaris L. (common lilac) on thepro-inflammatory functions of neutrophils. The authors alsoisolated active compounds, including neooleuropein from theextracts using bioassay-guided fractionation. It was found thatneooleuropein acts through inhibition of cytokine production byattenuation of the MAP kinase pathways (Woz'niak et al. ).Smooth muscle cells are a prominent target of diverse naturalproducts with different bioactivities (Hnatyszyn et al., 2003;Uhrin et al., 2018). Sandor et al. assessed the relaxant effectsor contracting activity of the hydroethanolic extract, fractions,phytoconstituents, and essential oil of Roman chamomile onsmoothmuscle preparations. The authors found that the essentialoil of the plant possessed a good smooth muscle-relaxant effect(Sandor et al. ).Identification of the molecular mechanism of action ofpromising natural products is a vital step toward theirclinical application (Butler, 2008; Tewari et al., 2018). In amechanistic study, Celin'ska-Janowicz et al. studied the apoptosis-inducing mechanisms of selected propolis components in tonguesquamous cell carcinoma cells (CAL-27). In another work,Grienke et al. isolated several flavonoids and rare sesquiterpenelactones from the ethanolic extract of Centaurea ragusina L., aplant species endemic to Croatia. For the first time they identifiedragusinin, and hemistepsin A from this genus. The authorsfurther studied the mechanism underlining the ragusinin activityin cancer cells (Grienke et al. ).In their review article Kozlowska et al. summarize the herbalmedicines used in the Beskid mountain ranges, which are locatedsouth of Krakow and Lviv, two important medieval centers ofapothecary tradition in the area. In another interesting reviewKunnumakkara et al. summarize potential benefits, traditionaluses, chemistry, biological activities, and clinical trials of \"guggul\"from Commiphora and Boswellia.Berberine is an important phytoconstituent of plants utilizedin different traditional medicine systems, including the Chinesesystem of traditional medicine (Huang et al., 2011). In their work\"Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, ExtractionMethods, and Relevance in Cardiovascular, Metabolic, Hepatic,and Renal Disorders\" Neag et al. review diverse biomedicalinformation on berberine, including several chromatographictechniques for berberine extraction and quantification.There is great interest of the scientific community towardthe health benefits of food items used in the Mediterraneandiet, which has a variety of health benefits (Sofi et al., 2010).Wang et al. review recent studies on pomegranate, mainlyfocusing on vasculoprotective effects attributed to diversepomegranate phytoconstituents, including tannins, especiallyellagitannins, and ellagic acid, among other compounds.Lycopene is a carotenoid which is responsible for differentpigmentation in tomatoes, grapefruit, and watermelon, and itrepresents a compound with a potent antioxidant action (Horvitzet al., 2004). In their work, Mozos et al. review mechanismsof action of lycopene on the vascular system consideringsubstantial epidemiological and experimental data, andclinical studies.Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women andrepresents a global health burden both in the developed anddeveloping countries. Hong et al. study apigenin and luteolin tobetter understand their mechanism of action in the context ofbreast cancer intravasation of the lymphatic barrier. Both of thesenatural compounds were evaluated in a three-dimensional assaysystem containing MDA-MB231 breast cancer spheroids andimmortalized lymph endothelial cell monolayers (Hong et al. )Toiu et al. evaluated the chemical composition, antimicrobial,antioxidant, and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of variousextracts of the aerial parts of an important plant species withtraditional use in Romanian, Ajuga laxmannii (Murray) Benth.In their work, Shikov et al. review 70 wild plant species thatare referenced in the 11th edition of the State Pharmacopeia ofthe USSR and also discuss their health food value, mainly basedon published Russian literature.Marchelak et al. present a comprehensive study focusedon extracts of the flowers of Prunus spinosa L. The authorsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2019 | Volume 10 | Article 3417Tewari et al. Central and Eastern European Ethnopharmacologyprofiled the phenolic contents of the extracts throughUHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS3, and also studied several biologicaleffects with relevance in the context of cardiovascular disease(Marchelak et al. ).Chowdhury et al. explore the anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic potential of various extracts of the medicinal plantcolocynth. The authors have found that ethanol and acetoneextracts of colocynth fruit pulp exhibit promising activity indifferent cancer cell types, inhibiting viability, and cell migrationin association with the modulation of the expression of diverserelevant genes and cellular pathways (Chowdhury et al. ).Ononis natrix is a member of the Fabaceae family and is a less-explored plant species.

In several chromatographic steps,three flavonoids and three sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) were isolated and identifiedfrom the most active fractions of the ethanol extract. Two STLs, one for which wecreated the trivial name ragusinin, and hemistepsin A are here reported for the firsttime as constituents of the genus Centaurea. All six compounds were screened fortheir effect on several tumor and one normal cell lines. Among them, ragusinin showedthe best bioactivity and high specificity to affect tumor murine SCCVII, human HeLaand Caco-2 cell lines, but not the viability of normal V79 fibroblasts. Due to thesecharacteristics the action of ragusinin was investigated in more detail. Since DNA isthe primary target for many drugs with antibacterial and anticancer activity, we studiedits interaction with ragusinin. Rather moderate binding affinity to DNA excluded it asthe primary target of ragusinin. Due to the possibility of STL interaction with glutathione(GSH), the ubiquitous peptide that traps reactive compounds and other xenobiotics toprevent damage to vital proteins and nucleic acids, its role in deactivation of ragusininwas evaluated. Addition of the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine potentiated the viabilityof HeLa cells, while the addition of GSH inhibitor L-buthionine sulfoximine decreasedit."
