      "text": "The dry weight was quantifiedgravimetrically.Sample adjustment and analysis: Cultures were dried after three weeksof cultivation. Powdered material was extracted with 80% aqueousmethanol (2 x 10 ml) for 30 min. Chlorophyll and lipids were eliminatedby liquid - liquid extraction with petroleum ether. Samples were ana-lyzed by HPLC and content of two main flavonoids baicalin andbaicalein was determined.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONSThe effect of phytohormones: Addition of a-NAA (10mg/l) has the high-est positive effect on the growth and flavonoid content. On the otherside, BAP and kinetin decelerate growth and decrease the flavonoidcontent. Results correspond with those for flask suspension cultures. (4)The effect of precursors and elicitors: Flavonoid biosynthesis was stim-ulated by the addition of sodium cinnamate, but not so much like insuspension cultures growing in flasks. (2) The final biomass of 6 g/l andthe flavonoid production of 0.075 g/l were achieved. Methylene blue caused an increase in the content of baicalin andproved to be a suitable elicitor for S. baicalensis bioreactor cultures.The flavonoid content was 2 times higher than in the control culture.MgATP and the combination of MgATP and methylene blue did notcause any significant improvement in flavonoid production. It wasprobably due to lower stability of MgATP during the long term culti-vation in bioreactor.Acknowledgments: The research was supported by Research projectMSM 0021620822 and SVV-2010-261-002 grant.REFERENCES1.

Stepe450, 11221 Belgrade, Serbia, 3Natural History Museum, Njegoseva 51, 11000 Belgrade, SerbiaThe genus Heracleum L. (Umbelliferae) comprises about 125 species1predominantly distributed in the temperate Northern Hemisphere andsix of them occur in the flora of Serbia2,3. Endemic species Heracleumverticillatum Pancic is a biennial herbaceous plant with a basal rosetteand the whorled upper branches. It differs from close related H. spho-ndylium L. by having softly pubescent to villous young branches2. Thespecies is restricted to silicious mountain massives in Central Balkan(E. Serbia, W. and S. Bulgaria, N.E. Greece) and its natural populationsinhabit wet places along the springs in subalpine zone.Roots, herbs (leaves and flowers), and fruits of H. verticillatum werecollected in June 2010 on Mt Stara planina (E. Serbia). Air-dried, pow-dered plant material was hydrodistilled according to the procedure ofthe European Pharmacopoeia 6.0, using n-hexane as a collecting sol-vent. Composition of isolated essential oils was analyzed by GC andGC-MS. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilutionmethod4 against standard Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus,S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillussubtilis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneu-moniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast Candida albicans.Roots yielded 0.36% (w/w) of essential oil (sample 1), herbs (leaves andflowers) yielded 0.17% (w/w) of essential oil (sample 2), and fruits yiel-ded 1.44% (w/w) of essential oil (sample 3). The main compounds ofroot essential oil were b-pinene (34.3%), limonene (24.8%) and an oxy-genated sesquiterpene intermedeol (12.8%). In the herb essential oilthe most dominant were (E)-caryophyllene (18.5%), g-palmitolactone(18.4%) and hexadecanoic acid (11.7%). The essential oil from fruitswas mainly composed of aliphatic esters (88.1%) and among them themost dominant were octyl 2-methyl butanoate (38.3%), octyl acetate(17.7%) and octyl isobutyrate (15.5%). Essential oils from the roots and herbs exhibited activity against bothstrains of Candida albicans 10259 and 10231 (MICs 131.00 and 32.75mg/ml for sample 1, and 133.00 and 16.62 mg/ml for sample 2) andagainst Micrococcus luteus (MICs 32.75 and 33.25 mg/ml for sample 1and sample 2, respectively). Herb essential oil was also active againstBacillus subtilis (MIC 66.50 mg/ml). Samples 1 and 2 were not activeagainst other tested microorganisms (MICs > 262.00 mg/ml), as well assample 3 (fruit essential oil) against all tested microorganisms (MICs >242.50 mg/ml).REFERENCES1.

Stepe 450, 11221 Belgrade, SerbiaSeseli rigidum W. K., Apiaceae is herbaceous perennial plant native toBalkan Peninsula. It contains essential oil in all plant organs, especiallyin aerial parts [1]. Dominant compounds of essential oil of aerial partsare a-pinene (53.3%), limonene (10.0%), germacrene D (9.3%) andmyrcene (6.0%) [2], while a-pinene (48.5%), camphene (4.6%), b-pinene(4.2%) and limonene (4.1%) are major constituents of flower essential oil [3].The aim of this study was to determine the composition of essentialoil of underground parts of S. rigidum which was not previously inves-tigated. Plant material was collected from two localities in Serbia, Brd-janska gorge from serpentine soil and Moravica from calcareous soil.Essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation from dried, commin-uted roots of S. rigidum. GC and GC/MS were applied for analysis of es-sential oil composition [4].28 components were identified in essential oil from Brdjanska gorgeand 32 in oil from Moravica, representing 93.9% and 94.9% of the totaloil, respectively. In both samples saturated and unsaturated hydro-carbons were the most dominant compounds (80.9-90.4%). Polyaceti-lene falcarinol was major constituent, representing 76.9% in oil fromMoravica and 89.0% in oil from Brdjanska gorge. Falcarinol occurs incommon food plants of family Apiaceae, such as carrot, celery andparsley. It demonstrates antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-aggre-gatory and cytotoxic activity [5, 6].Serpentine soil is usually characterized by low calcium to magnesiumratio and lack of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium andphosphorus [7]. Essential oil from sample from serpentine soil con-tained higher content of hydrocarbons and lower amount of monoter-pene hydrocarbons (0.2%) and sesquiterpenes (1.0%) than oil fromsample from calcareous soil (4.0% and 7.6%, respectively). In essentialoil from calcareous terrain monoterpenes a-pinene, limonene, myrcene,camphene and sesquiterpenes a-gurjunene and E-caryophyllene werepresent in larger amounts. b-sesquiphellandrene, germacrene D andgermacrene B were absent from serpentine soil essential oil sample.Essential oil from S. rigidum root contained polyacetilene falcarinol asmajor compound. Differences in essential oil composition from serpen-tine and calcareous soil can be observed in higher saturated and un-saturated hydrocarbons content in oil from serpentine soil and largeramount of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in oil from calcareous soil.REFERENCESKuznjecova G.

In both cases, there is a preference forantioxidants from natural rather than from synthetic sources (1). Inorder to discover new antioxidant principles we evaluated the radicalscavenging activity and inhibition of lipid peroxidation of extractsfrom seven Carduus species: Carduus acanthoides L., C. acicularisBertol., C. crispus L., C. candicans Waldst.& Kit. ssp. globifer (Vel. )Kazmi, C. nutans L, C. kerneri Simonkai ssp. austro-orientalis, C. tho-ermeri Weinm.These species are members of the family Asteraceae, tribe Cynareaeand are commonly known as thistles (2). In previous phytochemicalstudies the presence of flavonoids, lignans, pentacyclic triterpenoids,isoquinoline alkaloids, phenolic acids, sesquiterpene lactones,phenylpropanoids, and saturated fatty acids has been established (2-7). No reports on the antilipoxygenase and antioxidant activities ofstudied species are presently available. Radical scavenging and antioxidant activity of aquatic and ethanol ex-tracts from Carduus species were examined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (8) and 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) di-ammonium salt (ABTS) (9) free radicals; ferric re-ducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay (10) and inhibition of lipid per-oxidation in linoleic acid system by the ferric thiocyanate method(FTC) (11). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and ascorbic acid were usedas positive controls. In addition, the quantification of tannins and fla-vanoids were determinate using Folin-Chiocalteu reagent and AlCl3,respectively (12). The amount of tannins was expressed as pyrogallolequivalent (PE) g/100 dry weight (dw), the total flavonoid content wasexpressed as g quercetin equivalent (QE) g/100 g dw. All tested ex-tracts demonstrate significant radical scavenging, antioxidant activ-ity and some of them strongly inhibit lipid peroxidation compared tothe control. These plants, rich in flavonoids and other phenolic compounds couldbe a good source of natural antioxidants. Therefore this investigationcould be helpful for completing knowledge about pharmacological ac-tivity of genera Carduus.REFERENCES:1. Abdalla, A.E. and Roozen, J.P.
