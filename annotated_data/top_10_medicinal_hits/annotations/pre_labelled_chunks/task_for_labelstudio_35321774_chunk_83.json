The informationon medicinal uses of the endemic plants was collected by interviewingnative people, mainly farmers, elderly people, local herbal drugs sellers,traditional herbal medicine practitioners, housewives. A total of 160inhabitants (average 65 years old) were interviewed. The plantscollected, indicated by the locals, have been identified according to\"Flora of Albania\". Voucher specimens of the collected plants are201Macedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANTSposter presentationsFIFTH CONGRESS OF PHARMACY OF MACEDONIA WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATIONpreserved in the herbarium of Department of Pharmacy. The plantsare arranged in alphabetical order of their botanical names followedby the family, vernacular name, plant parts used and a brief note on itsethno medicinal use, methods of preparation and application. Theethnobotanical information collected was analyzed to obtain thefollowing data: number of useful plants mentioned, number ofbotanical families and the most common plants, plants to which mostuses were attributed, parts of plants most frequently mentioned etc.The frequency of citations for each of the reported plants, was usedas a basis to identify and to calculate the most frequently medicinalplants occurring in the study area. A comparative analysis with specificethnobotanical literature was carried out in order to highlightparticularly interesting aspects or uses not previously described in thespecific ethnobotanical and ethnomedicinal literature.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONNinetysix medicinal species belonged to 43 families are listed in thisstudy. The families most frequently present are Liliaceae, Lamiaceae,Asteraceae, Solanaceae and Rosaceae. The uses of the recordedspecies relate to mild ailments, mainly those of skin, gastrointestinaldisorders, urinary apparatus diseases etc. The medicinal plant prepa-rations were applied through different routes of administration likeoral, topical or dermal, and nasal routes. However, oral application(over 70%) was the highest and most commonly used route of appli-cation followed by topical or dermal application. The main vegetalpart used in the preparation of the remedies was the leaf and the in-fusion was the main mode of preparation. Fourty plants as Hypericumperforatum L., Salvia officinalis L. Cichorium intybus L. Allium sativumL., Origanum vulgare L., Crataegus spp., Juniperus communis L. Teu-crium polium L. Laurus nobilis L., Ulmus campestris L. , Trifoliumpratense L. etc., were the most frequently ones in the study area.CONCLUSION Phytotherapy in central Albania is nowadays practiced by some eld-erly people who resort to medicinal plants only for mild complaints.The study also highlights the uses of some plants, not previously de-scribed in the specific ethnobotanical and ethnomedicinal literatureas example: Paliurus aculeatus L. as antidiarrheal; Cercis siliquastrumL. in respiratory system disorders; Ecballium elaterium Rich. in liverdiseases and jaundice; Alopecurus myosuroides Huds., Juncus acutusL. in urinary apparatus diseases; Physalis alkekengi L., Solanum nigrumL., Trigonella corniculata L. in skin diseases, etc. These plants deserveto be taken into consideration for further phytochemical investiga-tion.REFERENCES1.

EVALUATION OF SEVERAL METHODS FOR THE EXTRACTION OF SAPONINS FROM HEDERA HELIX LEAF COLLECTEDIN ALBANIARezarta Shkreli, Enkelejda GociKristal University, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Department ofPharmacy, Tirana, AlbaniaINTRODUCTIONHedera Helix is a climber evergreen plant from 3 to 50 meters highwhich grows in Western Europe and Asia and in USA. It is widespreadin Albania, found in rocks, on the walls and on the wood. It consists oftriterpenic saponins: Hederacoside B and C (3-5%), r and r hederin,oleanolic acid, flavonoids, phenolic acids. Hedera saponins areexpectorant compounds helping the liquefaction of bronchialsecretions. Parts of saponins exceed bronchial cell wall reaching thefluid of bronchial secretions. These compounds are bitter andirritating in the mouth causing a cough that helps removal of mucusfrom the lungs. According to the literature saponins can be extractedwith water, diluted alcohol from plant material. Less polar solvent suchas: ether, chloroform cause precipitation of the saponins from theirconcentrate extract. There are no results about saponins extractionmethods from Hedera Helix grown in Albania so it would be sointeresting to select several extraction methods and to evaluate theirconcentration in hederasaponins.OBJECTIVESThe aim of this study is to determine and to compare some methodsfor saponins extraction from Hedera Helix leaves collected in AlbaniaMETHODS Hedera leaves were collected in 2010 by \"Filipi.Co\"in the industrial areaof Kurbin, Albania specialized in collecting and preparing medicinalaromatic plants. Five different methods were performed for alcoholichederasaponins extraction: >> Maceration with diluted etilic alcool for 3 days in roomtemperature.>> Multiple Maceration with diluted ethylic alcool: first and secondmaceration for 3 days with half quantity of solvent. >> Percolation method: first maceration with small quantity ofsolvent and second maceration in percolator for 24 hours.>> Ultrasound method with solvent for 2 hours, and:>> Soxhlet extraction with diluted alcool in soxhlet apparatus.All five extract were filtered and evaporated until the same concentration.TLC method was used for their evaluation. Solvent system was:chloroform: glacial acetic acid: methanol: water 60:32:12:8. Detectionsolvent; vanillin; phosphoric acid reagent. (VIS)RESULTS The five methods were efficient in extraction os saponins from HederaHelix collected in Albania. Mixture of 2 ml extract with 2 ml water andfoam formation presented saponins. TLC method showed thebisdesmosidic triterpene glycoside, Hederacoside C as a dark grey-bluzone in the lower Rf range 0,15 - 0.2 for all five extracts. The zone wasdifferent and represent more ore less concentrations. Whereas themonodesmosides r and r hederin migrate up to Rf 0.7-0.8 only forpercolator and soxhlet extracts.202Makedonski farmatsevtski bilten 57 (dodatok), 2011MEDITsINSKI I AROMATIChNI RASTENIJA poster prezentatsiiPETTI KONGRES NA FARMATsIJATA SO MEGjUNARODNO UChESTVOCONCLUSIONSPercolator method represented good-result in saponins extraction,then was Soxhlet, duble-maceration, maceration and finally ultrasoundmethod.

The DNA analysis showed that this is a sub species of Gym-nospermum altaicum. The name Scipetarum was proposed by Alban-ian biologists but is not registered yet. Gymnospermum altaicum subs.scipetarum has been found recently in Albania in the regions of El-basani and Gjirokastra. This plant was first described in Albania from Paparisto & Qosja1 in1976. The name scipetarum was given by Mayer & Pulevi2, with thespelling G. scipetarum. There are reports that the same plant has beenfound in Montenegro, too3. The Gymnospermium plants of the west-ern Balkan Peninsula are best treated as a subspecies of the wide-ranging Gymnospermium altaicum, which is from the Altai Mountains.In our laboratory we were interested in screening the chemical com-position of tubers of this plant. In this paper we will present the pre-liminary results on the analysis of the tubers of this plant extractedwith methanol. The analysis and identification was made with GC-MS.MATERIALS AND METHODSThis is a perennial plant with tubers between 8-12cm. Steam is thinand tall up to 20 cm and has yellow flowers. The tubers of the plantwere collected during the month of November. Their diameter goesfrom 2cm up to 8 cm depending on the age of the plant. They werecleaned, chopped in small pieces, dried till constant weight at RT,grinded and then extracted with methanol. Methanol extraction wasperformed under reflux for 3 hours by adding 1% tartaric acid in orderto get also some nitrogen containing components. After evaporationof solvent water was added and several extractions with chloroform ofacidic and basic water phases were performed, the collected fractionswere analyzed with TLC, GC-MC, HPLC. GC's were done in a Varian in-strument equipped with a ZB-5 column, 30m long. The oven condi-tions were: the temperature was kept at 800C for 1 min, then agradient of 50C/min up to 2800C.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSFor the methanol extraction were taken 30.17gr of grinded plant whichwere dissolved in 300ml of ethanol. 3gr of tartaric acid was added andthe mixture was refluxed for 3 hours. After evaporation of solvent wegot 10.35gr of crude extract. This crude extract was then dissolved in200 ml of 1% HCl and extracted three times with 50ml of chloroform.After evaporation of chloroform we got 0.35gr of organics which cor-respond to a yield of 1.31% of the dried plant. Then the aqueous phasewas basified with ammonia to Ph=9 and extracted three times with50ml of chloroform to give 0.09gr of organics which corresponds to ayield of 0.29%. These two fractions were analyzed with TLC whichshowed that both fractions contain products of a very different po-larity. There are more non-polar compounds in the crude taken fromthe acid phase than in the basic one.In order to better analyze and identify the volatile compounds we per-formed a GC of those two fractions. The chromatograms were verycharged with peaks and the separation was not so easy. With the helpof MS detector we were able to identify more than 50 compounds onthese fractions. But in order to facilitate that separation of fractionsby flash chromatography is a must. At the time being we are workingon that. In order to identify some heavier components we are now per-forming analysis of these fractions on HPLC using a Shimadzu instru-ment equipped with DAD detector. These data are not available yetand they will be subject of another paper soon.As a conclusion we might say that extraction of tubers with methanolallows extraction of a large number of organic compounds with widerange of polarity. More than 50 volatile components are identified byGC-MS. In order to better identify the substances separation by col-umn chromatography is necessary.REFERENCES1.Paparisto, K. Qosja, Xh. 1976. Bul.

Olive and olive oil have an important nutritive and economicsignificance for Albania. Numerous studies have been conducted onolives and olive oil which testify the great nutritive benefits that oliveoil has. One of the most important efforts in improving its nutritivevalue is the addition of other substances coming from the extractionof medicinal plants. In order to better improve its food qualities wewere interested in studying its chemical composition after having ex-tracted some chemical components from Hypericum perforatum. Theso called Oleum Hyperici is well known and has been used mainly forskin treatment, but there are some exemples of use in treatment of ul-cers and other stomach diseases1. This oil has been prepared usingfresh plant and extracting it for 40 days in the sunlight2. Analysis fromOleum Hypericy bought from the market showed that its physical andnutritive parameters were deteriorated. Acidity was very high and sowas the peroxide number. Our goal was to find extraction condition inwhich the active components of Hypericum perforatum could pass into the oil, but not changing its nutritive qualities. MATERIALS AND METHODSThe olive oil was chosen from the olives collected from the region ofTirana. This is oil with parameters of extra virgin olive oil in accordancewith EU regulation3. The plant was taken from plant collectors and itexact origin is not well known. Different extraction conditions werechosen for that purpose. All extractions were performed at low tem-perature, not higher than 400C, in order not to deteriorate olive oilqualities. Different amount of plant, 1%, 3% and 5%, was used and dif-ferent extraction times, 1 week, 2 weeks and 1 month, were studied.Also the effect of the light in this process was studied. In order to bet-ter identify the components of the plant in the olive oil, the plant wasextracted separately with hexane in Soxhlet apparatus. This extractwas then analyzed with GC-MS. GC's were done in a Varian instrumentequipped with a ZB-5 column, 30m long. The oven conditions were:the temperature was kept at 800C for 1 min, then a gradient of 50C/minup to 2800C. All different extracts taken from different conditions wereanalyzed for their physical properties like: acidity and peroxide num-ber. These experiments were done in order to see if there were anychanges in the olive oil because of the components of Hypericum per-foratum. At the same time each experiment was analyzed with GC-MSin order to see its chemical profile of fatty acids and the componentsof Hypericum perforatum extracted from the oil..RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONSFrom the analysis of physical parameters was concluded that the bestconditions were those which used 1% of plant extracted for 1 monthin darkness. In such conditions acidity and peroxide number remainedunchanged. The experiments carried out under the sunlight showedan increase in the peroxide number. This might be explained of all thephotosensitive radical reactions that the sun light induces. For eachexperiment we did analyze the chemical profile of fatty acids and com-pared it with the original olive oil prior to extraction. In all cases we didnot see any changes on the chemical profile. Also we analyzed thechemical composition of the extraction of Hypericum perforatum withhexane under Soxhlet condition in order to better identify the peakscoming from the plant. From the taken chromatograms we were ableto see that in all experiments we do have components coming fromthe plant. Samples with a longer time of extraction showed a higherpercentage of plant components. Even after one week we could seethat there are some small peaks coming from the plant."
