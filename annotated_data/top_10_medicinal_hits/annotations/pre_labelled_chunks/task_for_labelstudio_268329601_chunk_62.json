Conversationis impossible, until the powder has slowly beenmoistened and packed with the tongue between thegums and the cheeks.

Coca powder has an initial bitter tastewhich puckers up the mouth. The first noticeableeffect is a slight anaesthetizing of the tongue andmouth; this is followed by a general stimulation....The stimulation and capacity for performance andendurance which coca affords the individual and itsability to suppress hunger pangs gives the drug therole of an indispensable vademecum in the more orless itinerant life of deprivation which many Indians ofthe northwest Amazon must undergo. \"[Richard Evans Schultes, Harvard ethnobotanist]\"Woe to you, my Princess, when I come, I will kiss youquite red and feed you to you are plump.

Mastication, from a Greekword meaning \"to gnash the teeth,\" is the technicalterm for the chewing of food or other material,thereby rendering it easier to digest. A fewpsychoactive plants are considered masticatoriesbecause we chew the tissues, typically withoutswallowing them. The process is critical because itbrings the enzymes in our saliva into contact with theactive principles in the plant. Leaves are harvested from two shrubs (Erythrox-ylumcoca and E. novogranatense) native to South America.In older literature, the generic name Erythroxylon wasused for these plants. A person who chews the cocaleaf is a coquero. The pouch used to carry leaves isa chuspa. The gourd that contains the powderedmaterial to stimulate salivation and the action of thealkaloid is an iscupuru; the powder itself is calledllipta.As Dominic Streatfeild (2001) put it, \"... in its heart,South America runs on Coca Time.\" Both distance andtime are measured in terms of the amount of coca leafconsumed. The standard unit is the cocada, one ofwhich is the amount needed to walk at a comfortablepace on level ground for about 45 minutes or 3 km.HISTORYCoca leaves have been chewed by the Andean Indiansfor centuries to enable them to work harder and towalk longer distances through the mountains. TheGreat Inca himself once controlled its use. The leavesmature in about three or four years. An average chewis not more than 2 oz. per day. Coca leaves are oftenchewed in conjunction with powdered lime or ashes,typically carried in a purse or gourd.Angelo Mariani, a Corsican chemist, was aware ofrecent research, particularly that of Paulo Mantegazza,on the benefits of the coca leaf. He determined earlyon that Europeans would not take well to the habit ofchewing coca leaves, but that they would drink it. Hesoaked coca leaves in a pint of Bordeaux wine. Itsflavor masked that of coca and the alcohol enhancedthe leaching of the alkaloids. He named his newconcoction Vin Mariani and offered it for sale in1863. To say that it was an instant success would bean understatement! Mariani was also skilled atadvertising his new coca leaf wine, especially atgetting endorsements from the rich and famous. Avery incomplete list would include Thomas Edison,Henrik Ibsen, Auguste Bartholdi (who built the Statueof Liberty), Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, President WilliamMcKinley, Pope Leo XIII, and General U. S. Grant.Vin Mariana was so successful that he created anentire line of coca leaf products, including a throatlozenge, a non-alcoholic tea, and Elixir Mariana, withadded alcohol.One of the major figures in the history of cocaine isSigmund Freud (1856-1939), the Austrian physicianwho developed the theory of psychoanalysis. Early onin his career, he began reading about coca leaves andhow they enabled Indians in South America to \"resistprivations and hardships.\" He started using ithimselfand was so pleased with the results that he notonly recommended cocaine to his friends andcolleagues, but he supplied them with it. One suchrecipient was Martha Bernay, his future wife. Freud,who had not seen Martha for over a year, wrote to herin 1864 of his upcoming visit:\"In my last serious depression I took cocaine againand a small dose lifted me to the heights in awonderful fashion. I am just now collecting theliterature for a song of praise to this magicalsubstance.\" His \"song of praise\" was Uber Coca, published in1884. Students of Freud's writings say that it was anunusual work for him, in that he wrote so warmlyabout the subject and that the paper was marred bya series of minor errors. He noted, \"The psychic effectof cocaine consists of exhilaration and lasting euphoria... which does not differ from the normal euphoria ofa healthy person.... Absolutely no craving for cocaineappears after the first, or repeated, taking of thedrug. \"In 1885, reports of the dangerous side effects ofcocaine use appeared in the scientific literature. Thisaspect of the drug became very personal for Freudwhen he saw it destroy the life of his close friend,Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow, who was himself a brilliantand successful physician. Unfortunately, as the resultof an accident and subsequent amputation of histhumb, Ernst developed an extremely painful nervecondition. Over a period of time, he becamecompletely addicted to morphine. After seeing hisfriend in such a terrible straight, Freud offered himcocaine, which had recently been shown to curemorphine addiction. And, it worked! A year or so later,Ernst was now completely dependent on cocaine,taking what Freud estimated to be the equivalent of agram of pure alkaloid each day. The effects wereterrifying. Freud would later spend what he describedas \"the most frightful night of my life\" caring for hisold friend. What Freud did not know was that Ernstwas not only hooked on cocaine, but that he had goneback to morphine, too. Freud estimated that Ernstwould live for only a few more months, but he hungon for six more years. Freud kept a photograph of hisfriend hanging above his desk for the rest of his life.MODE OF ACTIONCocaine, an alkaloid, can be extracted from the leaveswith almost any organic solvent. It is chemicallyrelated to atropine and the other belladonna alkaloids.Cocaine is a stimulant to all parts of the centralnervous system. It produces its effects by increasingthe concentration of dopamine in certain regions ofour brain, especially those that produce a feeling of-212-pleasure. Dopamine is a naturally occurringneurotransmitter, a category of chemicals that carrymessages between nerve cells or between nerve andmuscle cells. The intense euphoria that results fromthese higher concentrations of dopamine is the \"rush\"that coke users describe. It is followed by the \"crash\"that comes when cocaine is flushed out of our system.Even natural dopamine levels are reduced, whichmeans that you will feel worse after cocaine wears offthan you did before. So what do we do? We soon findourselves in a feedback loop.Cocaine was once widely used as a local anesthetic.When applied topically, it paralyzes sensory nerveendings. It can produce a profound feeling of well-being, alertness, increased self-confidence,magnification of normal pleasures, reduction in socialinhibitions, and an enhancement of emotions andsexual feelings. Abuse of cocaine, which has becomea major health problem in this country, ischaracterized by:' headaches' seizures' strokes (especially in young people)' severe complications in pregnancy and childbirth(abortions, fetal death, premature birth, smallbabies)' paranoia' loss of weight and appetite' pallor' insomnia, and' what amounts to an all-consuming focus on itsuse, to the exclusion of concerns about eating,sleeping, money, responsibilities, and loved ones.Mood swings may be dramatic -- from elation tomania and delusions. There is reasonably decentevidence that Robert Louis Stevenson wrote \"TheStrange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" while underthe influence of cocaine.Crack is a highly addictive form of smokable cocainehydrochloride. It is made by adding ammonia orsodium bicarbonate and water, and then heating themixture. When it cools to room temperature it formspebble-sized crystals. The term \"crack\" refers to thesound made when it is smoked. It takes only about 7-10 seconds for the active principles to reach the brainand heart.PEYOTE\"[There] is another herb, like native tunas [a prickly-pear cactus]; it is called peyotl; it is white; it grows inthe north region.... Those who eat or drink it seevisions either frightful or mirthful; the intoxicationlasts two or three day and then ceases. It is acommon food of the Chichimecas, for it sustains themand gives them courage to fight and not to feel hungernor thirst; and they say that it protects them from alldangers.\" [Bernardino de Sahagun. General History ofThings of New Spain]\"On Good Friday, I found myself entirely alone in thequiet rooms in the Temple which I occupy when inLondon and judged the occasion a fitting one for apersonal experiment. I made a decoction ... of threebuttons, the full physiological dose, and drank this atintervals between 2.30 and 4.30 p.m. The firstsymptom observed during the afternoon was a certainconsciousness of energy and intellectual power. Thispassed off, and about an hour after the final dose Ifelt faint and unsteady; the pulse was low, and I foundit pleasanter to lie down.... The appearance of visionswith closed eyes was very gradual. At first, there wasmerely a vague play of light and shade whichsuggested pictures, but never made them. Then thepictures became more definite, but too confused andcrowded to be described.... Then, in the course of theevening, they became distinct, but still undescribable-- mostly a vast field of golden jewels, studded withred and green stones, ever changing. This momentwas, perhaps, the most delightful of theexperience....\" [Havelock Ellis. 1898]\"A vase containing a rose, iris, and carnation...nothing more, and nothing less than they actuallywere, a transience that was yet eternal life, aperpetual perishing that was at the same time pureBeing, a bundle of minute particulars in which, bysome unspeakable and yet self-evident paradox, wasto be seen the divine source of all existence.\" [Aldous Huxley. 1954.

It grows in the desertsof the American Southwest and in adjacent Mexico. Itsnatural distribution is centered in the Valley of the RioGrande. Peyote is one of the most fantastic vision-inducing plants of the New World. Perhaps because ofthis and the associated belief in its therapeuticproperties, it is the most sacred hallucinogenic plantof this hemisphere.-213-The common name of the plant is derived from theNahautl word \"peyotl,\" meaning a silk cocoon orcaterpillar's cocoon, a reference to the hairs presenton the upper part of the plant. HISTORY. No one knows exactly how far back in thehistory of the New World the peyote use goes.Sahagun suggested that the plant was in use in 300B.C. The Spanish historians make numerousreferences to the plant. The missionaries tried tostamp out the peyote cults of Mexico with littlesuccess. After almost 400 years of both religious andgovernmental sanctions, peyote is still widely used. Inthe past one hundred years its use by AmericanIndians has dramatically increased.Early opposition to the plant was directed mostly atthe pagan connotations that it had, rather than anyphysical or mental harm that it might be doing to theIndians. In a religious manual of the late 1700'sentitled \"El Camino del Cielo\" the priest is instructedto ask prospective converts if they had eaten the fleshof man, eaten the peyotl, or sucked the blood ofothers. A \"yes\" answer to any of the above apparentlyeliminates one as a serious candidate. Even Indianswho were thought to be converted to the new religionstill retained remnants of their old ways. It was notuncommon for parents to tie small bags of peyotearound the necks of their children to keep themhealthy. Older Indians also bowed when passing aplant. Combinations of peyote cults and Christianityappear, as seen in such titles as \"El Nino de Peyotl,\"and \"El Santo de Jesus Peyotes. \"The earliest uses of peyote in the United States goback to about 1760 in the territory that would becomeTexas. The plant was in common use by Indiansduring the Civil War. The spread of knowledge ofpeyote may have involved the Plains Indians' raidingparties that went into the Mescalero Indian territory ofthe Southwest. They saw the plant being used andbrought the information back with them. In the late1800's the Kiowa and Comanche Indians hadformulated a ceremony that was to become the basisof the peyote cult in more than thirty tribes. Theyformed semiofficial groups, such as the \"PeyoteSociety,\" and finally organized into the legallyconstituted body known as the Native AmericanChurch. Present membership of this group isestimated at 250,000, including members fromessentially all states and some of the provinces ofCanada. At first the Native American Churchencountered difficulty from the U.S. governmentbecause of the use of peyote during religiousceremonies. In 1933 John Collier, the Head of theBureau of Indian Affairs, succeeded in getting aregulation passed that \"...prohibited absolutely anyinterference by the Indian Bureau with the religiouspractices of the Native American Church.\" In 1962,the State of California decided that peyote had noreligious significance and attempted to prosecute theIndians. The American Civil Liberties Union enteredthe case and the Indians were ultimately victorious.RITUAL USE. In northern Mexico, the peyoteceremony usually involves a long meeting with lots ofdancing. In the U.S., the Indians use a ratherstandardized ritual patterned after the Kiowa-Comanche ceremony of the late 19th century. Thereare, of course, certain tribal variations. Often specialclothing must be worn and certain taboos must beobserved."
