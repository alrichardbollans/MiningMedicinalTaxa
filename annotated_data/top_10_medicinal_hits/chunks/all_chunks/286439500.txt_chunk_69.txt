Its mechanism of action is suggestedto rely on interactions with spindle microtubules leading tocell cyle arrest and mitotic catastrophe, inhibition of ABCtransporters thus abolishing multidrug resistance and finallymodulation of gene transcription (telomerase, cell death-related,cell cycle-controlling). These properties combined with thestronger-acting intercalating alkaloids can make the wholealkaloid fraction a unique multifaceted agent targeting cancercells.For example, El-Readi et al. (2013) demonstrated complexinteraction of chelidonine [1] and alkaloid-rich extract withseveral signaling pathways, including those responsible for cellcycle, cell death, and proliferation. Using microarrays confirmedby RT-PCR data, it was shown that a set of genes associatedwith multidrug resistance (e.g., ABC transporters and CYP) weresignificantly downregulated (from 50% in case of CYP3A4 to99% in ABCG2). On the other hand, caspase-3 and 8 geneswere upregulated (up to 27-fold). These results explain thestrong augmenting of doxorubicin toxicity to resistant Caco-2 and CCRF/ADR5000 cells. Upon low-dose treatment withchelidonine [1] (20uM), the LC50 decreased from 3.67uM(Caco-2) and 32.16uM (CCRF/ADR5000) to 0.42 and 7.4uM,respectively. Similar results were obtained with an adequateconcentration of extract (5ug/ml) containing (in decreasingorder) chelidonine [1], coptisine [31], stylopine [33], andprotopine [37] as four major compounds and smaller amountsof other alkaloids. In the more resistant CCRF/ADR5000 cellsthe effect of extract was even stronger than pure chelidonine [1],suggesting that some of the other alkaloids are more efficient P-gp inhibitors. Induction of apoptosis was the major mechanismof cytotoxicity, also supported by increase of caspase activity andannexin staining.These results support the potential of chelidonine [1] (and atleast some other C. majus alkaloids) as ideal agents to overcomeMDR as targeting both transport proteins, metabolic enzymesand pro-apoptotic pathways.The interference of chelidonine [1] with the cell proliferationapparatus was also demonstrated using planarian stem cell model(Isolani et al., 2012) in which the gene expression of mcm2(essential DNA replication factor) or inx-11 (a gap-junctionprotein essential for regeneration) was decreased by 20uM ofthe alkaloid. The stem cells were affected but not differentiatedpopulations such as neuronal or intestinal.Quite a particular story pertains to the mentioned earlierpatented product referred to as a semisynthetic derivative ofalkaloids--a trimeric structure with thiophosphoric acid moietyconnecting alkaloid molecules. It has been mentioned in theliterature as NSC-631570 or Ukrain R(c). However, one of themajor doubts regarding this product is its chemical identity(Panzer et al., 2000; Habermehl et al., 2006; Jesionek et al.,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299183Zielin'ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majus2016). Despite the earlier manufacturer claims, it couldn't bepositively confirmed that it is indeed a thiophosphoric acidcomplex and at least in some batches, it appeared as a richmixture of native alkaloids, that have been identified usingreliable chromatographic and spectroscopic methods.Several papers additionally report cytotoxic activity ofUkrain R(c) on other cell lines such as prostate cancer (LNCaP,PC-3), glioblastoma (T60, T63, primary cancer line), pancreaticductal adenocarcinoma (HPAF-II, HPAC, PL45, renal clear cell orpapillary cell-derived lines (Caki-1, Caki-2, ACHN), melanoma(B16F10) and murine (TUBO, 4T1) or human (SKBR-3) breastcancer (see Table 2 for respective references).However, due to the conflicting data about the chemicalidentity of this product, the previous results would have to berepeated or reinterpreted. If indeed Ukrain R(c) is just a versionof alkaloid mix, all the research done using it as an activesubstance would extend the scope of anticancer properties ofC. majus native alkaloids. One of the early interesting findingsis radiosensitizing influence of Ukrain R(c) (Cordes et al., 2002,2003) and it should be verified using non-modified alkaloid-richextract and individual compounds to find out which of themor a combination would be responsible for this property. Also,other studies reporting UkrainR(c)as an active principle need re-evaluation with native alkaloids as probably constituting majorcomponent in the patented preparation. Moreover, Ukrain R(c)remains the only preparation from C. majus that has a vastliterature documenting its anti-cancer and also other propertiesin clinical (see the respective section in the present paper),pre-clinical and in vivo studies.Anti-inflammatory and ImmunomodulatingSome of the versatile traditional uses of C. majus can beexplained, as inmany other herbs, by anti-inflammatory potentialtargeting various pathways in the organism as well as modulationof immune response. Both have been confirmed in many studiesusing in vitro cellular models, as well as in vivo.The ability to inhibit inflammation or, in some cases, tostimulate immune response and mitigate excessive reactivenesscan contribute to the postulated anticancer properties andimprove symptoms of gastric disorders as well.Schneider et al. (2016) used human colon cell line (NCM460)to check anti-inflammatory action of composite preparationscontaining C. majusmarketed and popular in Europe and any ofthe individual components. C. majus extract was among the mostpotent in a couple of checked parameters, such as inhibition ofIL-8, MCP, and I-TAC secretion, thus contributing significantlyto the overall and apparently synergistic combination of activeprinciples. This activity was likely to influence the clinicaloutcome mentioned below (Abdel-Aziz et al., 2017).Mostly, the total extracts or isolated alkaloids were tested,but in our opinion, other components such as hydroxycinnamicderivatives, flavonoids and chelidonic acid are likely to contributesignificantly. Chelidonic acid [45] was efficient in mouse modelsof ovoalbumin-elicited allergic rhinitis (Oh et al., 2011) andulcerative colitis (Kim et al., 2012). This compound alsoattenuated inflammatory responses by reducing levels and geneexpression of several mediators and enzymes in colon tissues(COX-2, HIF1a, PGE2) and in allergic mice (IL-4, IL-1b, COX-2,caspase-1, and increase of IFN-g). In human mast cell lineHMC-1 stimulated for inflammatory response by the phorbolester (TPA) and calcium ionophore A23187, chelidonic acid [45]inhibited IL-6 expression by blocking NFkB (Shin et al., 2011).Stylopine [33] added to the cell culture of inlipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages wasinhibiting production of several proinflammatory moleculessuch as nitric oxide, PGE2, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 (Jang et al.,2004). Also, iNOS and COX-2 protein levels were lowered.However, the cyclooxygenase activity inhibition was notselective. Chelidonine [1] and 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine[14a] in the same model inhibited NO production and iNOSand COX-2 gene transcription (Park et al., 2011). Theseresults suggest the underlying inhibition of NFkB as potentialmechanism but it wasn't investigated in this study.
