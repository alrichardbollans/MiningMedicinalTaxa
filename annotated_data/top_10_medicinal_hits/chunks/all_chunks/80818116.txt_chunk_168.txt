Additionally, falsi-fied medicines undermine the credibility of the health care systems, leading to a reduction in patient trust in the le-gal supply chain of medicines and spend valuable human and financial resources. Innovative pharmaceutical com-panies invest in pharmaceutical development to assure the quality, safety, efficacy of their respective products order to provide maximal therapeutic effect with minimum side effects. In contrary, the main goal of the manufacturers of falsified medicines is easy money. Falsified medicines may also cause loss of the credibility and reputation of the phar-maceutical companies (Council of Europe, 2013a; WHO, 2008).The "life-cycle" of falsified product involves unau-thorized manufacturers, brokers, illegal/unregulated sup-plier, wholesalers, and unregulated internet. Patients re-ceive falsified medicines easily without them knowing that the product is not what it is declared to be, not being aware of the consequences, the effect of these products, the in-ternet, and the manufacturers are encouraged to enter this business because it is extremely profitable and in many countries unregulated (MHRA, 2012).Taking into the account the threat and the extent of the phenomenon with the falsified medicines, a serious multi-lateral approach is necessary which includes taking mea-sures to combat the falsification of medicines at both the national and global level. Legislation in EUThe European Union (EU) has a strong legal frame-work for the licensing, manufacturing and distribution of medicines, centered around the Directive on falsified med-icines for human use (21. 07. 2011 - EU Directive 2011/62 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/83/EC) as regards the prevention of the en-try into the legal supply chain of medicinal products which are falsified in relation to their identity, history or source, so that only licensed pharmacies and approved retailers are allowed to offer medicines for sale, including legiti-mate sale via the internet (Council of Europe, 2011). Ac-cording to EU Directive 2011/62, falsified medicine is de-fined as any medicinal product with a false representation of: its identity, including its packaging and labeling, its name or its composition as regards any of the ingredients including excipients and the strength of those ingredients; its source, including its manufacturer, its country of manu-facturing, its country of origin or its marketing authoriza-tion holder; or its history, including the records and docu-ments relating to the distribution channels used. This def-inition does not include unintentional quality defects and is without prejudice to infringements of intellectual prop-S8 PP 326682Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 681 - 682 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationserty rights. According to EMA and the Directive, there are going to be different penalties and allegations for falsify-ing and counterfeiting medicines. This Directive aims to prevent falsified medicines entering the legal supply chain and reaching patients. It introduces harmonized safety and strengthened control measures across Europe by applying new measures, which can be grouped into four main pil-lars: safety features of medicines, supply chain and good distribution practice, active substances and excipients and internet sales.The Medicrime convention is the tool which EMA uses to criminalize the falsification of medicines. It gives directions on strategic approach for development the le-gal framework in the field of medicinal products, both na-tionally and internationally in order to better protect pub-lic health and national healthcare systems, through coop-eration between sectors in public administration, measures for national control, preventative measures etc. (Council of Europe, 2013b). Legislation in USAEMAs equivalent in the USA is the FDA. It is a fed-eral agency and is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is responsible for taking care of the general health, among other things, and therefore pro-vides legislation about falsified medicines. What the DI-RECTIVE 2011/62 is for EU, FDASIA is for USA, Con-gress of USA (Title VII of the Food and Drug Administra-tion Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, 2012). In this act through so called "sections" are described the ways to pro-tect the distributive chain and criminalize the falsification of medicines.Legislation in the Republic of MacedoniaIn R. Macedonia there is no specific law concerning falsification of medicines. The problem with falsification of medicines is covered partially by the Criminal Code of R.M., the Law of Medicines and Medical Devices and the Law of Customs measures and Intellectual Property Rights.ConclusionFalsification of medicinal products is a crime carried out using deception and other techniques typical of orga-nized crime and represents a public health problem and a problem of the trade competition as an intellectual prop-erty right infringement. An essential starting point in the fight against falsified medicines in R. Macedonia is the es-tablishment of an adequate national legal framework and regulatory system, based on the EU and USA legislation concerning this issue. Additionally, development of mech-anisms for effective collaboration and communication be-tween health authorities, police, customs, the judiciary, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, health profession-als and patients on national and international level is nec-essary aspect that should be considered for the success in this fight.ReferencesAssembly of the Republic of Macedonia, 1996.
