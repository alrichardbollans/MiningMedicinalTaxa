SharifuddinChapter 3adenosine diphosphate to adenosine triphosphate. The addition of another reagent containing luciferase and luciferin, where the enzyme catalyses a light-generating reaction between ATP, oxygen and luciferin. Initially, 2ml of cell culture was centrifuged at 1500rpm for 5 minutes and lOOpl of cleared supernatant was transferred into a sterile 96-well plate. Subsequently, lOOjxl of MycoAlert(r) was added to the 96-well plate and left at room temperature for 10 minutes. The luminometer was programmed to take one second integrated reading and the first reading was taken (reading A). Then, 100pi of MycoAlert Substrate solution was added to the same plate and left at room temperature for another 10 minutes before a second reading was taken (reading B). Finally, a ratio between the two readings was calculated and a ratio of less than 1, indicates uninfected cell line as the concentration of ATP in the sample is proportionate to light intensity. None of the cell lines used in the experiments were found to be positive of mycoplasma contamination in the annual screening process.3.5.3 Introduction to AHH-1 and MCL-5 Cell Lines.The AHH-1 TK+/' is a human B lymphoblastoid cell line that is derived from the RPMI-1788 cell line isolated from a healthy male donor. This culture was spontaneously transformed probably by the Epstein-Barr virus (Gentest Corporation manual, 1994), and the AHH-1 cell line was subsequently derived. The cell line has stable aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, expressing mixed-function oxygenase (MFO) activity that is essential in oxidative xenobiotic metabolism. Mediated gene transfer of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes/cDNAs is a preferred method in the construction of metabolically competent cells (Crespi et al.,1990). AHH-1 is homogenous, clonal derivative designed to be constitutively expressing a relatively high level of CYP1A1 (Crespi & Thilly, 1984) which is an isoform of cytochrome P450 that is involved in the oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) hepatically in humans.The MCL-5 cell line is a derivative of AHH-1 which has been transfected with five cDNAs namely CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 as well as microsomal epoxide hydrolase that are carried on a vector (Crespi et al., 1991). MCL-5 has been demonstrated to be more sensitive than the parent AHH-1 cell line and had been used successfully inCopy 1 113Y. SharifuddinChapter 3detecting genotoxic properties of many pro-mutagens and pro-carcinogens (Crespi et al.,1991; Doherty et al., 1996).Human lymphoblastoid cell lines were chosen over rodent cell lines with metabolic activation (S9 liver extract) for several reasons. In comparison to rodent cells, human cells are known to be 1000 times more sensitive to some cytotoxic antibiotics, twice as sensitive to radiation and six times more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (Cox et al., 1977a; Cox et al., 1977b; Hoffman et al., 1984; Gupta & Prasad, 1992). AHH-1 and MCL-5 cell lines possess genetically enhanced levels of metabolising enzymes as stated before and they are known to be sensitive to chemically active agents and those which require metabolism to manifest their effects.These cell lines are heterozygous for p53 but undergoes normal DNA repair and apoptotic responses upon genotoxins exposure (Guest & Parry, 1999). Both lymphoblastoid cell line possess a modal chromosome number of 48 with isochromosomes i(3q) and i(9p) (Doepker et al., 1998; Corso & Parry 1999).Furthermore, both cell lines which were chosen for micronucleus assay are also applicable in forward mutation assays (HPRT locus) allowing better data comparisons and illuminating mechanistic information.3.5.4 Thawing Frozen AHH-1 and MCL-5 Cells.The cryovial containing the cells were removed from the liquid nitrogen freezer; thawed in a water bath at 37+-1degC for a few minutes and decontaminated by spraying with 70% ethanol.The growth medium used was RPMI-1640 that has been supplemented with 9% horse serum and 1% L-glutamine. The thawed cell suspensions were transferred to two 80cm2 plastic tissue culture flasks with 50ml of growth medium, which was pre-warmed at 37+-1degC for 40 minutes. The flasks were then gassed with 5% CO2 in air and incubated at 37+-1degC. After 24 hours, the flasks were examined under the Nikon TMS phase contrast microscope proceeding from low, then to higher magnification, observing the condition of the cell cultures and anyCopy 1 114Y. SharifuddinChapter 3sign of contamination. Sub-culturing procedure began approximately after four days of growth with 60-75% cell confluency.The same procedure was employed for MCL-5 cells except 200pg/ml hygromycin-B wastI added to 50ml of growth medium. Hygromycin-B is an aminoglycosidic antibiotic produced| by Streptomyces hygroscopicus and the recombinant vectors in MCL-5 are maintained as anextrachromosomal plasmids that confer resistance to hygromycin-B.i3.5.5 Sub-Culturing Procedure for AHH-1 and MCL-5 Cells.The 80cm tissue culture flasks were shaken to dissociate loose cell aggregates that were growing exponentially and the cell suspension were dispensed into centrifuge tubes. The cell cultures were centrifuged at 1500rpm for 8 minutes and a Neubauer haemocytometer was used to determine the number of cells. Cell density was maintained at 1.5xl05 cells per mland the cells were cultured for a maximum period of three weeks to ensure a stable karyotype (Doherty et al., 1996). Prior to treatment, the cell cultures were seeded into several 25cm tissue culture flasks to achieve a final concentration of 1.5xl05 cells per ml. The cells were then gassed with 5% CO2 in air and incubated at 37+-1degC for 24 hours.The same procedure was employed for MCL-5 cells except 200pg/ml hygromycin-B was added to the growth medium.3.5.6 Introduction to V-79 Cell Line.V-79 cells are an immortal cell line derived from male Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus) lung fibroblasts. It has a long history in its application for mutagenicity assays due to several properties. The cell line possesses a high cloning efficiency at 75-95%, able to grow rapidly from a small inoculum with a doubling time of 12 to 16 hours (Bradley et al.,1981). It also has short lag period. V-79 cells have a relatively stable karyotype with a modal chromosome number of 22+-1 that is relatively large, making this cell line suitable for aneuploidy studies (Bradley et al., 1981).Copy 1 115Y. SharifuddinChapter 3V-79 cells were first grown in 80cm flasks in a monolayer, with Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum. The cells were gassed with 5% CO2 in air and incubated at 37+-1 degC.Routine sub-culture of V-79 cells involved re-suspension of cells at lxl 05 cells/ml every 2- 3 days with fresh growth medium, depending on the culture confluency. Detachment of cells from culture flask surface was achieved using 3ml of 2.5% trypsin-EDTA followed by brief incubation at 37+-1 degC for one minute and gentle tapping.None of the cell lines used were cultured continuously for more than three weeks and cells from new cryovials were used for each replicate of experiments. Cells were sub-cultured routinely but not to exceed 10 passage numbers.3.5.7 Cell Doubling Time Determination.The cell doubling times for AHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79 were determined beforehand. Even though the doubling times for these cell lines can be found in the literature, the author conducted a short experiment to determine the cells doubling time. The cells were seeded atrthe initial concentration of 1.5x10 cells/ml in different 25cm culture flasks containing the necessary components to suitable growth media as stated previously. Each of the 25cm2 culture flasks were labelled to correspond to different time-points between 16 to 24 hours, where the cell number were determined using a Neubauer haemocytometer at the desired time- points. The result for this experiment was then used for subsequent experiments where the cell doubling time for V-79, AHH-1 and MCL-5 were established to be 18, 19 and 23 hours respectively and was considered to be comparable to those described in the literature (Gentest Technical Manual; Crofton-Sleigh et al., 1993). However, a treatment time of 24 hours for all cell lines were adopted instead. The experiments were conducted in three replicates and the raw data can be found in Table Al of the Appendix.Copy 1 116Y. SharifuddinChapter 33.5.8 Treatment with Andrographolide.Andrographolide (CAS no.5508-58-7; molecular weight 350.45) with 98% purity was stored in cool and dry place. Andrographolide to be used at various concentrations was prepared by dissolving the crystals with DMSO (CAS no.67-68-5, >99.5% purity) as solvent and administered to AHH-1/MCL-5/V-79 cell cultures within two hours of preparation. Fresh stocks were always prepared for each experiment replicates. Flasks containing healthy- looking, evenly distributed cells were selected and labelled according to doses. Less confluent flasks were allocated for negative control and low dose treatments while more confluent flasks were allocated for high dose treatments. After serial dilutions, the labelled 25cm2 flasks containing 10ml of cell cultures were treated with increasing doses andrographolide in DMSO to give 10-90pM final concentrations respectively. Two 25cm flasks were allocated for each dose and at the top dose of 90pM andrographolide, there was0.9% DMSO. Four 25cm2 flasks were assigned as untreated negative control. Subsequently,40pl of cytochalasin-B in DMSO was added to each flask giving a final concentration of 6pg/ml as suggested by Parry et al. (2002). The addition of cytochalasin-B was performed under subdued lighting as the compound is light sensitive. The final concentration of DMSO in the culture medium was less than 1 %.The cell cultures were then gassed with 5% CO2 in air for approximately 10 seconds and incubated at 37+-1degC for 24 hours. The possibility of andrographolide precipitation occurring in the growth medium pre- and post-incubation was determined earlier and at these concentrations, no precipitations were observed.Positive control slides were obtained by treating the AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells with 25jig/m 1 Mitomycin -C (CAS no.50-07-7). Mitomycin-C (MMC) is a known cross-linking agent in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation which had demonstrated to be genotoxic in all in vivo and in vitro test systems using mammalian cells, including the in vitro micronucleus test (Gupta & Singh, 1982; Ishidate et al., 1988; Mavoumin et al., 1990; Sofuni et al., 1996; Matsushima et al., 1999; von der Hude et al., 2000). The Ames test also showed that MMC is a genotoxicant (Quillard et al., 1985) and the compound was proven to be carcinogenicCopy 1 117Y. SharifuddinChapter 3(Ishidate et al., 1988). DMSO at 90jiM final concentration was also use as a second negative control since it was used as a vehicle for andrographolide.In the initial phase of the study, a dose-setting assay was conducted where AHH-1 cells were treated with andrographolide between 10 and lOOpM. However, the number of doses was later reduced.3.5.9 Cell Harvesting and Slides Preparation.After 24 hours, the cell suspensions were dispensed into correspondingly labelled 10ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 1500rpm for 8 minutes. The supernatant was safely disposed and the cell pellets were re-suspended into clean and clearly labelled centrifuge tubes containing 3ml PBS (pH 7.4); they were vortexed using a Whorlimixer for one minute to achieve a suspension of single cells. 120pl of the each treated cell suspension were added into the wells of the cytospin and spun at lOOOrpm for 5 minutes. Subsequently, slides were fixed in 90% ice-cold methanol for 10 minutes as described by Fenech (2000) and air-dried before storage at -20degC.3.5.10 Staining Techniques.Staining with Giemsa.The air-dried slides were immersed in 20% Giemsa solution for 8 minutes but the slides were examined after 6-7 minutes to ensure appropriate staining intensity, which is important for the scoring procedure. After 8 minutes, the slides were removed, rinsed twice in PBS (pH 6 .8) for 5 minutes and air-dried. Subsequently, the slides were briefly dipped in Xylene (99.99%) and coverslips were immediately but carefully placed over the cells mounted with DPX. Care was taken to avoid the formation of air bubbles underneath the coverslips. Slides were viewed using the Olympus BH-2 light microscope.Staining with Acridine orange.Prepared slides were also stained with acridine orange. Fixed slides were placed in coplin jar containing 1.25pg/ml acridine orange for 10 seconds. The slides were then placed in phosphate buffer (pH 6 .8) for 10 minutes and then transferred to fresh buffer and left for oneCopy I 118Y. SharijuddinChapter 3hour. The slides were air-dried in the dark and stored away from light. Olympus BH2-RCF fluorescence microscope with triple band-pass filter was used to view the slides, which involved placing a few drops of PBS (pH 7.4) onto the cytodots of the slides.3.5.11 Cell Scoring Procedures.The Giemsa-stained slides were coded and scored at 1000X magnification under oil immersion using an Olympus BH-2 light microscope. The scoring procedure was performed as described by Fenech et al. (2003) as shown in Figures 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 respectively. The cells were categorised into mono-, bi-, tri-, tetra-, and multinucleated cells. In this study, micronuclei were scored in at least 2000 binucleated cells per dose; micronuclei in other cells were not taken into account.As suggested by Fenech et al. (2003), the binucleated cells selected for scoring micronucleus frequency must possess the following characteristics.1. The cells should be binucleated.2. The presence of two nuclei with intact nuclear membranes and located within the same cytoplasmic boundary.3. The two nuclei in a binucleated cell should be approximately equal in size, staining pattern and intensity.4. The two main nuclei in a binucleated cell may touch but ideally should not overlap each other. A binucleated cell with two overlapping nuclei can only be scored if the nuclear boundaries of each nucleus are distinguishable.5. The presence of intact cytoplasmic boundary or cell membrane and clearly distinguishable from the membrane of neighbouring cells.The criteria adopted for classifying micronuclei in binucleated cells were as suggested by Fenech et al. (2003):1. Micronuclei are oval or round in shape.2. The diameter of micronuclei in human lymphocytes usually varies between 1/16th and l/3rd of the mean diameter of the main nuclei which, corresponds to 1/256* and 1/9* of the area of one of the main nuclei in a binucleated cell respectively.Copy 1 119Y. SharifuddinChapter 33. Micronuclei are not linked or connected to the main nuclei.4. Micronuclei may touch but must not overlap the main nuclei and the micronuclear boundary should be distinguishable from the nuclear boundary.5. Micronuclei usually have the same staining intensity as the main nuclei but occasionally staining may be more intense.6. Micronuclei are non-refractile and they can therefore be readily distinguishable from artefacts such as staining particles.Nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB) are sometimes observed in binucleated cells following exposure to clastogens and are believed to originate from rearranged chromosomes with more than one centromere, e.g. dicentric chromosomes. The criteria used for scoring nucleoplasmic bridges as suggested by Fenech et al. (2003):1. NPB are a continuous nucleoplasmic link between the nuclei in a binucleated cell.2. The width of a nucleoplasmic bridge may vary considerably but usually does not exceed lA of the diameter of the nuclei within the cell.3. NPB should have the same staining characteristics of the main nuclei.4. NPB are preferably scored in binucleated cells with clearly separated nuclei because it is usually difficult to observe an NPB when the nuclei are touching or overlapping.5.
