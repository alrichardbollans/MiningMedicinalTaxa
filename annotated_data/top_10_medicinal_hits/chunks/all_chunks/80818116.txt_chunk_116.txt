Functional food pro-vides the health advantages because of their physiologically active substances (Maskovicet al., 2015). Phenolics and fla-vonoids isolated from plants are one of the groups of func-tional ingredient which can enhance health, increase psychi-cal and mental well-being and scavenge free radicals (Men-rad, 2003). It is known that family Lamiaceae, where sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum, L.) belongs to, has a strong anti-oxidant activity because of great amount of phenolic and fla-vonoid components. Phenolic antioxidants prevent free rad-icals from the substrate by donating hydrogen atoms or elec-trons (Kaurinovic et al., 2011). Sweet basil is widely used plant which could be used in the form of teas, essential oils, liquid extracts, and as a spice and has an important appli-cation in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. It is mostly used in a treatment of inflammatory diseases, headaches, constipation, respiratory infections, flu, cough, insomnia and also as sedative and anticonvulsant. It is es-timated that about 60% of the total population of the world uses herbs and natural products and basil is recognized as important drug in their nutrition (Harvey, 2000). Materials and methodsDifferent extracts were obtained by various types of extraction: maceration with ethanol (30%, v/v) and dis-tilled water (30 minutes and 24 hours), infusion (10 min-utes), microwave (4 minutes) and ultrasound extraction (10 minutes). The amount of total phenolic compounds in the extracts was determined colorimetrically with the Fo-lin-Ciocalteu (FC) reagent (Bozin et al., 2008). The absor-bance of the resulting solution was measured at 760 nm on a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The concentration of to-tal phenolic compounds was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per g of dried extract (DE), using a stan-dard curve of gallic acid. Measurement of total flavonoid content in the investigated extracts was determined spec-trophotometrically, using a method based on the formation of Al-flavonoid complex with the absorbance maximum at 430 nm. The flavonoids content was expressed as l g of quercetin equivalents (QE) per g of dried extract (DE), by using a standard line. Antioxidant activity of extracts was determined using the DPPH method (Grujic et al., 2012). Absorbance was measured at 515 nm. The IC50 value, de-fined as the concentration of the test sample leading to 50% reduction of the free radical concentration, was calculated graphically and expressed as mg of the extract/mL of the fi-nal solution in measuring cell. Testing of the neutralization of peroxide and hydroxide radical were carried out. RSC value represents the percentage of neutralization of perox-ide or hydroxide radical. The IC50 value which defined as the concentration of the test sample leading to 50% reduc-tion of the radical was tested. Absorbance was measured at 515 and 562 nm. Lipid peroxidation intensity was also tested and absorbance was measured at 532 nm. The IC50 values represented the concentration of the tested extract are responsible for 50% inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Chemical characterization of basil extracts was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using UV/Vis and fluorescence detectors. S5 PP 229482Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 481 - 482 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsResults and discussionBasil extracts contained chlorogenic, p-hydroxyben-zoic, caffeic, ferulic, vanillic, rosmarinic and cinnamic acid, rutin, quercetin, naringenin i epicatechin. From phe-nolic acids, the most common in the extracts are rosmarin-ic and ferulic acid which is in agreement with similar re-search (Lee and Scael, 2009). Using a fluorescent (FAD) detector, epicatechin was identified. Based on these re-sults, it can be concluded that the FAD is sensitive for the determination of certain flavonoids (epicatechin) com-pared to UV/Vis detector which is in accordance with the literature (Donovan et al., 1999). Total phenolic content ranged from 0.53-118.19 mg GAE/g DE, and the highest yield was determined in extract obtained as infusion af-ter 10 minutes. Flavonoid content ranged from 0.42-2.84 mg KE/g, with peak in microwave extract after 4 minutes. IC50 values (concentration of analyzed sample that is re-quired for 50% inhibition) varied from 11.72-210.39 mg/mL for DPPH radical. The highest antioxidant capacity showed a sample obtained with 30% ethanol after 30 min-utes. Testing the neutralization of the hydroxyl radicals, re-sults showed that the IC50 values ranged from 11.44-57.86 mg/mL. The highest scavenging activity showed a sample obtained by ultrasound by extraction after 10 minutes. Ex-amination of antioxidant activity by neutralization hydro-gen peroxide indicates that the samples obtained by dif-ferent extraction methods have shown IC50 values ranging from 0.41-52.45 mg/mL. The highest antioxidant activity, showed sample obtained by extraction with 30% ethanol for 30 minutes. Results of examination of antioxidant ac-tivity by the ability of inhibition of lipid peroxidase are summarized and IC50 values ranged from 1.41-46.99 mg/mL. Lowest IC50 (the highest antioxidant potential) corre-sponded to the sample obtained by the extraction with wa-ter for 30 minutes. ConclusionBasil extracts showed significant antioxidant activity. Sweet basil is a rich source of antioxidants that could con-tribute to its disease-fighting potential. Extracts with the strongest antioxidant capacity were obtained by ethanol (30%, v/v) maceration during 30 minutes and infusion dur-ing 10 minutes. Fluorescence detector of HPLC showed higher sensitivity for epicatechin determination than UV/Vis detector.ReferencesBozin, B., Mimica-Dukic, N., Bogavac, M., Suvajdzic, Lj., Simin, N., Samojlik, I., Couladis, M., 2008.

They may be-long to food or medicinal plants. The research in last 10 years has concentrated efforts to identify molecular targets for these natural components. Several major cell-signal-ing pathways have been identified by which plant derived components influence carcinogenesis. Carcinogenesis may affect: transcription factors (nu-clear factor-kapa B (NF-kB), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3), anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X1), pro-apoptotic proteins (caspases), protein kinases (mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP)), cell cycle proteins (cy-clins), cell adhesion molecules, cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2), lipoxygenase (LOX) and growth factor pathway. A big variety of plants employs modulation of NF-kB activity as the main pathway for anticancer effect. NF-kB can be acti-vated by free radicals, inflammatory stimuli, cytokines, en-dotoxins, radiation etc. This paper presents natural occur-ring components for which evidence-based research identi-fied some molecular targets in cancer prevention and ther-apy (anethole capsaicin, curcumin, diosgenin, gambog-ic acid, gingerol, resveratrol, thymoquinone, ursolic acid, zerumbone) (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006; Aggarwal et al., 2008; Nobili, 2009; Rajput and Mandal, 2012).Selected plantsAnethole and derivatives (dithiolethione, eugenol, isoeugenol) present in fennel, anise, and camphor increase intracellular level of glutathione and glutathione S-trans-ferase. Eugenol and isoeugenol are antioxidants, affect lipid peroxidation and inhibit arachidonic acid - induced tromboxane B2, due to which these components are used in adenocarcinomas (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006). Ane-thole blocks NF-kB activation and affects inhibitory kappa B alpha kinase (IkBa). The suppression of carcinogenesis by anethole and derivatives is proposed to be by mediation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induced cellular respons-es (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006; Aggarwal et al., 2008).Capsaicin presents anticancer effects in culture cells (human tumor cells) and in animal models (skin, colon, lung, tongue and prostate cancer). Capsaicin lead to accu-mulation of cells in G1 phase induced apoptosis and in-hibited proliferation. The molecular mechanism included blocking TNF-mediated activation of NF-kB. In human multiple myeloma cells it also blocked the STAT3 activa-tion pathway (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006; Aggarwal et al., 2008). Active compound of curcumin is polyphenol diferu-loylmethane. It down regulates COX-2 and LOX expres-sion, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necro-sis factor (TNF), chemokines, cell surface adhesion mole-cules, growth factor receptors (epidermal growth factor re-ceptor - EGFR and human epidermal growth factor recep-tor - HER2) and inhibits protein kinases (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2006; Aggarwal et al., 2008).Diosgenin, as a steroid saponin, is common for many different plants. It inhibits proliferation and straightens apoptosis in cell cultures (human colon cancer, osteosar-coma, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis). The proposed mo-lecular mechanisms are disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, release of apoptosis-inducing factors, modulation of cas-pase-3, COX-2 and LOX activity, binding to chemokine receptor. It can suppress osteoclastogenesis through inhi-bition of TNF-mediated activation of NF-kB (Aggarwal et al., 2008).S5 PP 230484Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 483 - 484 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsGambogic acid derived from resin of Garcinia indi-ca inhibited gastric, hepatic breast and lung cancer. Some of the specific molecular mechanisms include inhibition of telomerase and telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA ex-pression and interaction with transferrin receptor. Since it inhibited the expression of gene products in apoptosis, pro-liferation and angiogenesis, which are all regulated by NF-kB it modulates on general level NF-kB pathway (Aggar-wal et al., 2008). Gingerol has been tested mostly in prostate, gastric and breast cancer. Topically applied it inhibited COX-2 ex-pression by suppression of NF-kB (Aggarwal and Shisho-dia, 2006).Resveratrol from grapes uses many different general molecular targets in apoptosis among which modulates ac-tivity of NF-kB and MAP kinases (Aggarwal and Shisho-dia, 2006).Thymoquinone, a quinone from black cumin, sup-presses proliferation of colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic and breast cancer, osteosarcoma, myeloblastic leukemia. It down regulates COX-2 and 5-LOX activity, iNOS, TNF and cyclin D1 which are all known to be regulated by NF-kB. Thymoquinone prevented tumor angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo (Aggarwal et al., 2008).Ursolic acid is a triterpenoid present in many plants in different amounts, but considerably in rosemary. It sup-presses expression of genes regulated by NF-kB, COX-2, LOX, iNOS, matrix metaloproteinase. It induces apoptosis by inhibition of DNA replication, inhibition of protein ty-rosine kinases, activation of caspases and induction of Ca2+ release (Aggarwal et al., 2008).Zerumbone, isolated from essential oil of wild ginger, has been effective in colon, breast and skin cancer. It inhib-its activation of NF-kB and NF-kB-regulated gene expres-sion. It also suppresses superoxide and nitric oxide gener-ation and down-regulates COX-2, interleukin (IL-1) and TNF (Aggarwal et al., 2008).Conclusion Plants known as spices, general food or medicinal plants have been investigated for anticancer activity. It was found that they target different molecules in carcinogene-sis. Therefore, the contribution to antitumor effect of a sin-gle plant may be due to synergic action of all active signal-ing pathways that the plant exert.
