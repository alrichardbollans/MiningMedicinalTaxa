Laws need to be enacted in a manner that allows Member States to truly trust the implementation with an impartial authority, and ultimately with the courts.After discussing the roles of European level regulatory agencies, we have to mention the important regulatory role of national regulatory agencies. By interpreting and explaining the European and national laws in various 'guidelines', the national food and medicine agencies also create European law. For example, the Finnish Food Agency has been active in explaining to entrepreneurs how they interpret food laws. The food agency has published, among others, the following 'guides': labelling guide, - food supplement guide, - additive guide, - health claim guide, - guide on microbiological hazards of food and drinking water, - legal guide on sports nutrition, - requirements related to food contact materials, - guide on sale of farm or household food, - guide on food sales outside. -These guides can be fairly extensive compared to actual laws. For example, the guide on food supplements, updated in July 2006, has 58 pages.177 In comparison, the European directive on food supplements 2002/46/EC has 7 pages, and the Finnish regulation implementing the directive has only a couple of pages. This means the rules are, from the business viewpoint, largely based on 'the guide'. The guide on food supplements is very detailed and important issues such as the division between foodstuff and medicine are addressed. This kind of detailed advice is, by regulation targets, understood as law. The above-discussed question of combining scientifi c independence with democratic accountability applies also to national agencies.The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) uses the following phrase to warn people about their unreliable soft law: "This MHRA guidance should not be taken as a complete or defi nitive statement of the law. It is not intended as a substitute for legal or other professional advice. The MHRA accepts no responsibility for any loss or damage caused, arising directly or indirectly, in connection with reliance on the contents of this guidance." This disclaimer is used for example in "A guide to what is a 176 Krapohl 2004, 520.177 The guide is available (in Finnish) at http://www.palvelu.fi /evi/fi les/55_519_331.pdf.-29-medicinal product"178 and "The Medicines Borderline Section and the Internet". In the latter, the Agency describes its interpretation on what kind of Internet information will make the product a medicine instead of food.Principles of democracy can, and must be, included in agency procedures. There is danger that an industry takes over a regulatory agency, which is called regulatory capture. This can happen when EU agencies or national agencies work close together with targets of the regulation, in this case food and medicine industries. As these industries are important both economically and from a human perspective, the companies and their representatives are very powerful. They are also eager to defend their own interests and demand legislation that helps make business profi table. The agencies must weigh these concerns with consumer and public health needs. Citizens need to trust that public health is kept as the guiding principle for authorities' actions.The basic issue of science vs. politics remains. The issue of whether food law should be based purely on science, or on "other legitimate concerns" has been debated in international arenas. Besides scientifi c risk assessment on threats to consumer's health, other concerns eligible for consideration in setting food standards are economic sustainability, technological feasibility, environmental risks, consumer concerns, animal health and welfare, and ethical/religious/cultural factors. The EC generally thinks these other concerns are essential in ensuring acceptance of food law. The US generally thinks the presumption of taking into account these other concerns means opening a Pandora's box.1792.2.3 Structure of European Food and Medicine LawAbove, we have discussed the roles of European legislators and regulatory agencies. In this chapter, we map out the outcome of their work: the framework of European law on foodstuffs and medicines. This does not include standards or self-regulation, which will be discussed below.2.2.3.1 FoodstuffsThe basic European regulation on foods is the General Food Regulation 178/2002/EC. It includes all the general principles of European food law such as the responsibility of food industry operators, scientifi c risk assessment, and the precautionary principle. The General Food Regulation is referred to in other food laws. A 31-page guidance document from 2004 specifi cally explains certain Articles of the Regulation that have been unclear to EU food chain operators and third country trading partners180.With regard to biological safety of foods, the most important legal tool is the Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs181. The hygiene rules take particular account of the HACCP (Hazard 178 MHRA Guidance Note No. 8 (previously MAL 8) April 2003.179 Poli 2004, 623-624.180 Guidance on the Implementation of Articles 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 of Regulation (EC) Ndeg 178/2002 on General Food Law.

Chemical safety is the goal of regulations on contaminants182, residues183, and food contact materials184. Proposed regulations on additives185, fl avourings186, and food enzymes187 will guarantee the safe use of these substances. Also on novel foods, a new Regulation is emerging188. A common procedure for evaluating additives, fl avourings, enzymes, and novel foods will be created189. GMO foods are regulated by the GMO food regulation190 and the traceability and labelling regulation191.Food supplements are regulated by their own directive192. It covers food supplements consisting of vitamins and minerals. Other supplements are under national law. Food fortifi cation with vitamins and minerals is likewise regulated at EU level193 and fortifi cation with other substances by national laws. Dietary foods (foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses) have to comply with their own rules194.Laws on food marketing are about to change as the Commission has proposed a new Regulation on providing food information to consumers. This regulation will replace the former food labelling and nutrition labelling directives. The long-awaited regulation on nutrition and health claims in food marketing195 came into force in 2007.The above-mentioned hard law norms on foodstuffs are supplemented by various soft law documents. For example on novel foods, there is the "Commission Recommendation concerning the scientifi c information and the safety assessment report required",196 and on health claims, the "Scientifi c and Technical Guidance for the Preparation and Presentation of the Application for Authorisation of a Health Claim" by the EFSA197.2.2.3.2 MedicinesThe European rules on medicinal products consist of hard law and soft law. It is almost impossible to differentiate between the two. Everything is included in "The Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union", published by the European Commission.198 These rules include the following ten volumes:182 The basic principles of EU legislation on contaminants in food are in Council Regulation 315/93/EEC. Maximum residues levels for certain contaminants in food are set in Regulation 1881/2006/EC.183 Maximum residue limits are set for veterinary medicinal products according to Regulation 2377/90/EC.184 The Framework Regulation 935/2004/EC sets up general requirements for all food contact materials.185 COM(2006) 428 fi nal.186 COM(2006) 427 fi nal.187 COM(2006) 425 fi nal.188 COM(2007) 872 fi nal.189 COM(2006) 423 fi nal.190 1829/2003/EC.191 1830/2003/EC.192 46/2002/EC.193 1925/2006/EC.194 Directive 89/398/EEC and specifi c Directives on specifi c dietary foods.195 1924/2006/EC.196 97/618/EC.197 SP/NDA/CLAIMS/WD/1, Rev 4-Final.198 This collection of rules is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/index.htm.-31-Volume 1 - Pharmaceutical Legislation.

Medicinal Products for human use in clinical trials (investigational medicinal products).Volume 1 includes directives and regulations on human medicines, which are clearly hard law, and enforceable by courts. The most important piece of law regarding human medicinal products is Directive 83/2001/EC199. The 65-page directive has 127 Articles and a 40-page Annex.The directive has fourteen Titles:Title I: Defi nitionsTitle II: ScopeTitle III: Placing on the Market Chapter 1: Marketing authorisation Chapter 2: Specifi c provisions applicable to homeopathic medicinal productsChapter 2a: Specifi c provisions applicable to traditional herbal medicinal productsChapter 3: Procedures relevant to the marketing authorisationChapter 4: Mutual recognition procedure and decentralised procedureTitle IV: Manufacture and importationTitle V: Labelling and package leafl etTitle VI: Classifi cation of medicinal products200Title VII: Wholesale distribution of medicinal productsTitle VIII: AdvertisingTitle VIIIa: Information and advertisingTitle IX: PharmacovigilanceTitle X: Special provisions on medicinal products derived from human blood and plasmaTitle XI: Supervision and sanctionsTitle XII: Standing committeeTitle XIII: General provisionsTitle XIV: Final provisions.199 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use (Offi cial Journal L 311, 28/11/2001 p. 67 - 128).200 This means classifi cation into prescription medicines and non-prescription medicines.-32-The Annex of the Directive gives the analytical, pharmaco-toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of medicinal products. The Annex refers to Commission and EMEA guidelines for further instructions.Besides Directive 83/2001/EC, another important piece of law is Regulation 726/2004/EC201, which includes rules of the centralised market authorisation procedure and the working rules of the EMEA.As stated above, the directive on medicinal products does not cover all the detailed requirements for medicinal products. Guidelines are needed to complement the hard law. The need for a new guideline may be triggered by frequently encountered problems with established products, by the development of new technologies, new practices or new therapeutic areas, or by international activities202. Guidelines are prepared by experts, and undergo input from academia and the industry during consultation. They are intended to be suffi ciently fl exible so as not to impede scientifi c progress.203With Volume 2 (Notice to Applicants), the binding nature of the rules is not as clear. The Commission describes the Notice as follows204: "This Notice to Applicants has been prepared by the European Commission, in consultation with the competent authorities of the Member States and the European Medicines Agency. This Notice has no legal force and does not necessarily represent the fi nal views of the Commission. In case of doubt, therefore, reference should be made to the appropriate Community Directives and Regulations. "The Notice to Applicants was fi rst published in 1986 and is regularly updated. It is presented in three parts: Volume 2A dealing with procedures for marketing authorisation;- Volume 2B dealing with the presentation and content of the application dossier; and- Volume 2C dealing with Regulatory Guidelines.- 205Regulatory guidelines in Volume 2C are related to procedural and regulatory requirements such as renewal procedures, dossier requirements, summary of product characteristics (SPC), package information, readability of the label and package leafl et requirements.206Volume 2B has particular status compared to other parts of the Notice to Applicants. Volume 2 B is referred to in the Annex of directive 2001/83/EC: "The particulars and documents accompanying an application for marketing authorisation ... shall be presented in accordance with the requirements set out in this Annex and shall follow the guidance published by the Commission in The rules governing medicinal products in the European Community, Volume 2 B, Notice to applicants, Medicinal products for human use, Presentation and content of the 201 Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency (Offi cial Journal L 136, 30/4/2004 p. 1 - 33).202 Procedure for European Union guidelines and related documents within the pharmaceutical legislative framework.

"207 The particulars and documents "shall be presented in strict accordance with the format".208The Annex of Directive 2001/83/EC refers also to other parts of Volumes 2 and 3. In assembling the dossier for application for marketing authorisation, applicants shall also take into account: the scientifi c guidelines relating to the quality, safety and effi cacy of medicinal products -for human use as adopted by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) and published by the European Medicine Evaluation Agency (EMEA) and the other pharmaceutical Community guidelines published by the Commission in -the different volumes of "The rules governing medicinal products in the European Community".Volume 3 gives guidelines for human medicines. As opposed to Commission regulatory guidelines, these are scientifi c guidelines by EMEA. Guidelines are produced by the EMEA Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) through its Working Parties or its membership of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH).209 The guidelines include: Introduction, - Quality Guidelines, - Biotechnology Guidelines, - Non-Clinical Guidelines - Clinical Effi cacy and Safety Guidelines, and - Multidisciplinary Guidelines. - 210EMEA prepares scientifi c guidelines in consultation with the competent authorities of the Member States. Guidelines exist to "help applicants prepare marketing-authorisation applications for medicinal products for human use". Guidelines are intended to "provide a basis for practical harmonisation of the manner in which the EU Member States and the EMEA interpret and apply the detailed requirements for the demonstration of quality, safety and effi cacy contained in the Community directives". They also "help to ensure that applications for marketing authorisation are prepared in a manner that will be recognised as valid by the EMEA".211The role of regulatory and scientifi c guidelines has been clarifi ed by "Procedure for European Union Guidelines and Related Documents within the Pharmaceutical Legislative Framework", drafted by the EMEA in 2005. Previously, guidelines have also been given under the name "note for guidance". The term "position paper" has been used on documents that refl ect on issues of scientifi c uncertainty. In future, only the term "guideline" will be used. 207 Annex of Directive 2001/83/EC, Introduction and general principles, point (1).208 Annex of Directive 2001/83/EC, Introduction and general principles, point (2).209 Shah - Griffi n 2003, 44.210 European Commission web page: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/eudralex/homev3.htm.211 EMEA introductory note on scientifi c guidelines. http://www.emea.europa.eu/htms/human/humanguidelines/background.htm.-34-Distinction with respect to limited experience and/or the need for ongoing revision will be outlined within the scope of the guideline.212Guidelines are defi ned as follows: "In the pharmaceutical legislative framework, a guideline is a Community document that is drafted either: to - fulfi l a legal obligation laid down in Community legislation, or to - provide advice to interested parties on the best or most appropriate way to fulfi l an obligation laid down by law. "Scientifi c guidelines "refl ect a harmonised EU approach and are based on the most up-to-date scientifi c knowledge as possible".213Guidelines are drafted via an agreed procedure including a concept paper, a draft guideline, consultation etc.214 Comments to guidelines are expected for example from other regulatory authorities (e.g. FDA and other ICH partners), European industry associations and European scientifi c and academic societies, patient or consumer groups and health care professionals215.Guidelines may have different purposes and legal status although the general rule is that guidelines do not have legal force216. The defi nitive legal requirements are those outlined in the EU Directives, Regulations, and Decisions, as well as national rules. However, guidelines are to be considered as a harmonised Community position. If they are followed by relevant parties such as the applicants, marketing authorisation holders, sponsors, manufacturers and regulators, it will facilitate assessment, approval and control of medicinal products in the EU. Nevertheless, alternative approaches may be taken, provided that these are appropriately justifi ed.217Scientifi c guidelines are referred to in the annex to Directive 2001/83/EC and listed in the annexes to the Notice to Applicants. In assembling the dossier for an application for a marketing authorisation, applicants shall take into account the scientifi c guidelines relating to the quality, safety and effi cacy of medicinal products. These guidelines are adopted by the scientifi c committees, such as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) and the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC), and published by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). These scientifi c guidelines aim to provide a basis for practical harmonisation of the manner in which Member States and EMEA interpret and apply the 212 Procedure for European Union guidelines and related documents within the pharmaceutical legislative framework.
