R. rosea extract has a stimulatingeffect on the CNS, suggesting potential benefits on cognitive functions, memory,learning, and attention. The reproducible efficacy and quality of preparations ofthe underground parts of R. rosea depend on the highly variable content of theactive markers, salidroside and rosavin, which affect the quality of HMP and dietarysupplements. However, it is not clear which analytical markers are important forassessing the efficacy of R. rosea preparations intended for use in aging-induced mildcognitive disorders, such as attenuated memory, attention, and learning. Furthermore,the activity of various commercial R. rosea extracts has not been correlated with theircontent. Here, the biological activities of salidroside, rosavin, and seven commercialextracts of underground parts of R. rosea were assessed using a synaptic model ofmemory: long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in hippocampus slices.A high degree of variation in the content of all active markers was observed. Oneextract from China lacked rosavin, and there was even variation in the extracts fromthe Altai geographic region. In vitro, rosavin, salidroside and all tested R. rosea extractspotentiated electric stimulation of an intra-hippocampal electric circuit, which resultedin higher responses of the pyramidal cells in isolated hippocampus slices. Rosavinwas more active at higher concentrations than salidroside; while, salidroside was moreeffective at lower concentrations. The highest content of both active markers wasfound in the extracts that were active at the lowest concentrations tested; while, someextracts contained some other compounds that presumably reduced the efficacy dueto antagonistic interactions.

Quality Control of Rhodiola Extracts by Bioassaythe quality control of herbal preparations containing R. rosea extracts, but insufficientfor assessment of their potential efficacy. Additional bioassays are needed to assure thereproducible pharmacological activity of R. rosea extracts; therefore, the LTP of synaptictransmission in hippocampus slices may serve as a validation tool for the quality controlof R. rosea extracts.Keywords: Rhodiola rosea, salidroside, rosavin, long-term potentiation, hippocampus, quality control, UPLCINTRODUCTIONRhodiola rosea L. [Crassulaceae, syn. Sedum rhodiola - DC. Sedumrosea - (L.) Scop cop, known as roseroot, rosenroot, goldenroot, arctic root, orpin rose, rhodiole rougeatre] (Currier andAmpong-Nyarko, 2015) has a long history as a valuable medicinalplant and has appeared in the Materia Medica of severalEuropean countries (Panossian et al., 2010). Rhodiola rosea L.roots and rhizome extracts are active ingredients in adaptogenicherbal medicinal products (HMP) and dietary supplements fortemporary relief of symptoms of stress, such as fatigue andweakness (Panossian and Wagner, 2005; Panossian and Wikman,2009, 2010, 2014; EFSA, 2010; Panossian et al., 2010; EuropeanMedicine Authority [EMA], 2011). A growing body of evidencehas indicated the extract's potential use in the prevention andtreatment of stress- and age-related impairments of cognitivefunctions and mental disorders (Panossian et al., 2010, 2014;Panossian, 2013; Panossian and Gerbarg, 2016; Amsterdam andPanossian, 2016; Nabavi et al., 2016). The stimulating effects ofR. rosea on the CNS were demonstrated long ago and suggestedthere were potential benefits on cognitive functions, memory,learning, and attention (Saratikov et al., 1965, 1978; Marina andAlekseeva, 1968; Kurkin and Zapesochnaya, 1986; Petkov et al.,1986; Marina et al., 1994; Saratikov and Krasnov, 2004). An activecompound, named rhodioloside was isolated and identified assalidroside (Aksenova et al., 1968; Saratikov et al., 1968). A pilotstudy of rhodioloside (syn. salidroside) in 46 healthy humanvolunteers showed that 2.5 mg salidroside increased attentionin cognitive tests 1 h after a single dose was administeredin 83% of subjects, compared with 54% of volunteers whowere administered placebo (Aksenova et al., 1968). Furtherstudies provided evidence that R. rosea and salidroside exhibitneuroprotective activity (Qu et al., 2009; Panossian et al., 2010,2012; Jacob et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013), suggesting they maybe effective in treating neurodegenerative disorders, such asAlzheimer's disease (Nabavi et al., 2016).Along with salidroside and its aglycone tyrosol (Figure 1),cinnamyl alcohol, glycosides, and rosavins (collective nameof rosavin, rosarin, and rosin) also exhibited stress-protective(Barnaulov et al., 1986), stimulating, and neurotropic activities inrodents; reduced sleep induced by barbital, hexanal, and chloralhydrate in mice (Sokolov et al., 1985, 1990); increased locomotoractivity in mice (Sokolov et al., 1990); and induced anti-depressant-like effects in animal models of depression (Panossianet al., 2008). Salidroside is common for all species of Rhodiola,while phenylpropanoids, rosavin, rosarin, and rosin are specificonly for R. rosea and R. sachalinensis (Kurkin et al., 1985;Nakamura et al., 2007; Booker et al., 2016b). Many publicationshave reported on the neuroprotective and neurotropic activityof salidroside (Sokolov et al., 1985, 1990; Barnaulov et al., 1986;Panossian et al., 2008; Cifani et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2013); while,there is limited evidence supporting the importance of rosavin,the major active marker (Sokolov et al., 1985, 1990; Panossianet al., 2008; Cifani et al., 2010; Marchev et al., 2017).
