Animal test requirements vary from no need for toxicological testing to four tiers of tests (tier I: acute toxicity; tier II: genetic toxicity; tier III: sub-chronic toxicity; tier IV: chronic toxicity).846The test requirements depend on the categories of the raw materials. If the product is made of common foods and Category I ingredients, and processing and consumption of the food are traditional, no tests are required on raw material of fi nished products. However, if the product is processed and consumed so that dosage is greater than normal, tests are needed on fi nal products. For foods made of category II ingredients, tests on the fi nal product are always needed. For those 842 See complete list by Huang - Lapsley 2005, 267-269.843 See complete list by Huang - Lapsley 2005, 269-272.844 See complete list by Huang - Lapsley 2005, 272-274.845 Ministry of Health: Technical Standards for Testing and Assessment of Health Food. Promulgation date 14 February 2003, effective 1 May 2003. 846 Huang - Lapsley 2005, 274-275.-151-other ingredients that are not common foods, or category I or II ingredients, tests are always needed both on the raw material and the fi nished product. The strictest requirements apply if the raw material has no historical human consumption data at all.847There is no specifi c legislation on food supplements in China and food supplements thus do not form a separate legal category. The pre-market authorisation requirements depend on whether the supplement contains vitamins, minerals, or something else, and whether or not health claims are presented on the product. As stated above, only health foods are allowed to bear health claims in China. This applies to foods in food form and food supplements.For those supplements that contain authorised vitamins or minerals, there is a special procedure under the Health Food Regulation. They need to obtain an "Approval Certifi cate for Health Food" prior to production, but clinical tests on safety and effi cacy of the vitamin or mineral are not required. The producer still needs to show hygiene, stability etc. Other supplements such as those containing dietary fi bres, proteins, or amino acids, are considered common foods where no pre-market control applies. For common foods, health claims are not allowed. If health claims are required, the supplement must undergo the whole health food process.8484.2.2.5 Safety of Novel Foods 4.2.2.5.1 Defi nition of Novel Food There is a new Regulation on novel foods in China849. The previous Regulation dates back to 1990. Everything that has appeared on the Chinese market since 1990 has been considered novel. The new Chinese defi nition of novel foods is the following850: Animals, plants and micro-organisms that are not traditionally consumed in China;(1) Raw food materials that are derived from animals, plants and micro-organisms and are (2) not traditionally consumed in China;New varieties of micro-organisms that are used during food processing;(3) Raw food materials the original composition or structures of which are changed by the (4) adoption of new techniques during production. According to the previous defi nition in the 1990 law, novel foods are newly manufactured, newly discovered and newly introduced materials, which people are not accustomed to eating or are accustomed to eating in very local places, and meet basic requirements as food. The concept of novel food includes raw materials and fi nal products.851 The Novel Food Regulation does not cover GMO food or additives, which are regulated separately. Novel foods must undergo a pre-market assessment by the Ministry of Health. Foods listed in Article 2 but not yet approved and published as novel foods by the Ministry of 847 Huang - Lapsley 2005, 275.848 Huang - Lapsley 2005, 266.849 Administrative Measures on Hygiene of Novel Foods. 2007.850 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 2.851 Novel Food Regulation 1990, Article 2.-152-Health shall not be manufactured, operated or used as food or raw food materials852. A producer must himself evaluate whether his food product is novel. The Ministry of Health will make the decision once it has received and reviewed a novel food application, and inform the applicant if the novel food is considered a regular food853. This means novel food evaluation starts by evaluating whether the food is in fact novel. The Ministry of Health will publish a list of products that have been considered regular foods854, and this list will help later applicants in determining whether an application is necessary. A consumer will recognise a novel food from labelling: "Novel foods or food products containing novel foods shall be labelled in compliance with relevant government regulations and names indicated in the labels shall be identical to that announced by the Ministry of Health. "855 As the new regulation came into force, there were some 340 novel foods on the market. These may be reviewed to comply with the new rules. An example of a novel food authorised according to the previous regulation is the sugar replacement Isomalt, made by Palatinit. It was the fi rst non-Chinese food to pass the Chinese Novel Food approval process set by the Ministry of Health in September 2006. The approval allows Isomalt to be labelled as a "New Resource Food" instead of just an "additive". The producer believes this will make the ingredient more attractive to food makers and that the novel food status will help to differentiate the ingredient from similar products on the market. Palatinit claims that most other polyols have been approved under the food additive standard. The novel food standard is perceived as more diffi cult but potentially more valuable.8564.2.2.5.2 Safety Requirements of a Novel FoodAccording to Article 5 of the Novel Food Regulation, "Novel food shall comply with the Food Hygiene Law of the People's Republic of China, pertinent regulations, rules and standards, and shall not cause any acute, sub acute, chronic or other latent health hazards". Food safety is the very goal of novel food legislation, and because the food is novel, safety of long-term use in particular is not easily determined. Food safety assessment of novel food shall follow the principles such as risk assessment and substantial equivalence857. Risk assessment refers to "scientifi c evaluations on known or potential negative effects of food borne hazards which human body exposes to upon human health, including four steps: hazard identifi cation, hazard characterisation, exposure assessment and risk characterisation"858. The doctrine of substantial equivalence means that to avoid unnecessary or duplicative research efforts, essential similarity to traditional or already authorised products is used as proof of safety. The Ministry of Health has an Expert Assessment Committee on Novel Foods that is responsible for safety assessment of novel food. The Assessment Committee is composed of experts in fi elds of food hygiene, toxicology, nutrition, micro organisms, processing 852 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 18.853 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 13.854 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 15.855 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 22.856 AP-foodtechnology.com. News 26/09/2006. 857 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 6.858 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 28.-153-techniques, chemistry, pharmacology, etc.859 The Assessment Committee shall exercise its safety assessment on the basis of the following materials and data:source of novel food, -traditional consumption history, -processing techniques, -quality standards, -main ingredients and contents, -estimated intake, -usage and scope of application, -toxicology, -biological features, -genetic stability, -pathogenicity and toxicity of strains of microbiological products, and -other scientifi c data. - 860 The Ministry of Health may reassess an approved novel food in any of the following circumstances:With the development of science and technology, recognition of food safety and (1) nutrition about approved novel food has changed;Challenges raised against food safety and nutritional quality of novel food;(2) As required by supervision and monitoring of novel food. (3) If the approved novel food fails to pass the reassessment, the Ministry of Health may announce prohibition on production, business operation and use of the food.861 The Chinese criteria for establishing novel food safety are similar to the European legislation. The nutritional aspect of safety is relevant in China in a manner similar to the European approach. Safety of a novel food is not regarded as such but rather as part of the diet where the novel food replaces another food. In addition to the Chinese Novel Food Regulation, there will be further, more precise, regulations on novel foods: "Ministry of Health formulates and promulgates safety assessment regulations, technical specifi cations and standards of novel food".862 One can expect a similar puzzle of regulations as with Health Foods. It would be simpler if regulation targets could read the novel food regulations in one piece of law. 4.2.2.5.3 Decisions or Regulations? According to the Chinese Novel Food Regulation, the Ministry of Health publishes the list of approved novel foods, which, based on characteristics of different novel foods, should cover contents such as: 859 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 7.860 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 8.861 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 9.862 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 6. -154- generic name (including Latin name), - species, - source, - biological characteristics, - adopted techniques, - main ingredients, - edible parts, - dosage level, - scope of application, - ethnical group of application, - intake amount, - and quality standards; - for micro organisms, their strain numbers - 863 shall also be indicated.864 According to Article 20 of the Novel Food Regulation, "Food manufacturers shall verify the Ministry of Health's announcement and make sure their products are substantially equivalent with the announced items before they start manufacturing or using the novel food." This means the list of approved novel foods will serve other operators as proof of established safety. The operators need not repeat the novel food application. Substantial equivalence is defi ned in Article 28 of the Regulation: "Substantial equivalence: means that if raw materials or food ingredients of a novel food are substantially equivalent to traditional food or food ingredients or approved novel food in terms of species, source, biological characteristics, main ingredients, edible parts, dosage level, scope of application and group of application, and their processing techniques and quality standards adopted are basically identical, the novel food is considered equally safe as the traditional counterpart and has substantial equivalence." This means that in China, a food is legally equivalent to traditional foods if a previously authorised substantially equivalent novel food exists. In Europe, the same situation at the moment calls for a notifi cation. For example Noni fruit was fi rst in Europe authorised as a novel food in 2002, after which it has been notifi ed dozens of times. As described above, discussions on the property nature of the novel food authorisation have been ongoing in Europe. It has been proposed that instead of decisions, novel food authorisations should be given as regulations applicable to all operators. The efforts of the applicant would in this case be rewarded by granting a period of exclusivity to the research data on safety. 863 According to freedictionary.com, strain means "a group of organisms of the same species, having distinctive characteristics but not usually considered a separate breed or variety". For example with probiotics, safety and functionality are strain dependent, and genus, species, and strain number are often given in labelling. Coueret et al. 2004.864 Novel Food Regulation 2007, Article 14.-155-4.2.2.6 Safety of Genetically Modifi ed Foods Chinese GMO legislation has existed since the early 1990s, and been developed since. However, a Regulation on the Hygiene of GMO Foodstuffs was not enacted until 2002865. GMO foods were regarded as normal food before 2002. According to Bian, Chinese legislation on GMOs foods has been practical and responded simply to the need for food. Increasing amounts of GMO food are imported into China, particularly soybeans, especially from the United States. Academia or the public have not been consulted in GM issues or their regulation.866There are fi ve major government agencies that oversee GMOs in China.867 This inevitably leads to a situation where the farm to table -approach is not fulfi lled, and overlap and confl ict is bound to happen. For agricultural GMOs that are intended for use as raw materials, importers must apply for an agricultural GMO safety certifi cate from the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry of Health is primarily responsible for regulating GMO food.868 Foreigners intending to export fi nished GMO food to China will need to apply for a safety certifi cate from the Ministry of Health. The application must include an assessment report on GM food safety and its nutritional quality, produced by a testing agency accredited by the Ministry of Health. In addition, the exporter must show documents to prove that the GMO food has been approved for use in the exporting country.869Under the GMO Food Regulation, all foods made from animals, plants or micro organisms, whose genome composition is modifi ed through biotechnology, need to undergo a safety assessment and approval process. The GMO Food Expert Committee established by the Ministry of Health carries out the safety assessment, within 6 months of receiving an application870. The 865 Administrative Measures on Hygiene of GMO Foodstuffs, Regulation No. 28 (2002) of the Ministry of Health, was issued on 8 April 2002. Other GMO regulation includes: - Regulations on Genetic Engineering Management, Regulation No. 17 (1993) of the State Commission of Science and Technology. - Regulations on Safety Control of Agricultural Genetically Modifi ed Organisms, Regulation No. 304 (2001) of the State Council. - Implementation Regulations on Safety Assessment of Agricultural Genetically Modifi ed Organisms, Regulation no. 8 (2002) of the Ministry of Agriculture, issued on 5 January 2002. - Implementation Regulations on Safety of Import of Agricultural Genetically Modifi ed Organisms, Regulation no. 9 (2002) of the Ministry of Agriculture, issued on 5 January 2002. - Implementation Regulations on Labelling of Agricultural Genetically Modifi ed Organisms, Regulation No. 10 (2002) of the Ministry of Agriculture, issued on 5 January 2002.866 Bian 2004. China imported 11.3 million tons of soy already in 2002, and imports were increasing.867 They are: the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health, the State Environmental Protection Administration, and the General Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine. MOST is responsible for national research and development of science and technology. It is the competent authority responsible for genetic engineering. Each process of genetic engineering (research and experimentation, fi eld testing, pre-market production testing etc.) is subject to safety assessment and safety control measures. The National Genetic Engineering Safety Committee supervises and coordinates these activities. Wanhua 2003, 99. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is in charge of agricultural GMO Regulation. Wanhua 2003, 100. SEPA is responsible for China's environmental protection and biodiversity conservation. Wanhua 2003, 100. AQSIQ is the Chinese customs offi ce. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) is also involved in formulating GMO regulations. Wanhua 2003, 101.868 Wanhua 2003, 100. 869 Wanhua 2003, 106.870 Wanhua 2003, 105.-156-safety assessment includes nutrition assessment. Also unanticipated effects must be taken into account. 871 The Ministry of Health administers the list of authorised GMO foods. GMO food must also be labelled as such, see chapter 5.Critics claim that China's control of GMO use in agriculture is poor. For example in 2005, it was discovered that illegal genetically modifi ed rice was being grown and sold in a Chinese province872. The GMO Food Regulation makes the Ministry of Health responsible for inspections, but does not specify how these control activities shall be carried out. Chinese GMO regulations are still under development, and China ratifi ed the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety873 in 2005. China's adherence to international agreements is important, as China is potentially the largest GMO producer and consumer874 in the world.875 4.3 Medicine Safety 4.3.1 EU: Different Categories of Medicinal Products In Europe, safety and effi cacy requirements for human medicines are governed by directive 83/2004/EC. Besides provisions applicable to all medicinal products, there are specifi c provisions for:herbal medicinal products, -traditional herbal medicinal products, -homeopathic medicinal products, -immunological medicinal products - 876,radiopharmaceuticals - 877, andmedicinal products based on human blood or human plasma. -Particular provisions on immunological medicinal products, radiopharmaceuticals, and medicinal products based on human blood or human plasma are not discussed here.871 Wanhua 2003, 100.872 China Internet Information Centre. http://service.china.org.cn/link/wcm/Show_Text?info_id=149812&p_qry=gmo.873 A global protocol that aims to regulate international trade of GMOs. The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is part of the Convention on Biological Diversity. http://www.cee-foodindustry.com/news/ng.asp?n=60140-gmo-issues-step.874 For example in 2006, China imported 28.27 million tons of soybeans, a historical high. Most of them were GM-soybeans. Soyatech web page: http://www.soyatech.com/news_story.php?id=1725.875 Wanhua 2003, 107-108.876 'Immunological medicinal product' means any medicinal product consisting of vaccines, toxins, serums or allergen products. Directive 83/2001/EC, Article 1.4.877 'Radiopharmaceutical' means any medicinal product which, when ready for use, contains one or more radionuclides (radioactive isotopes) included for a medicinal purpose. Directive 83/2001/EC, Article 1.6.-157-4.3.1.1 Modern Medicines878 Here we discuss the substantial safety criteria for medicines. The pre-market authorisation procedures for medicines were discussed above in chapter 2. According to Regulation 726/2004/EC879, "in the interest of public health, authorisation decisions under the centralised procedure should be taken on the basis of the objective scientifi c criteria of quality, safety and effi cacy of the medicinal product concerned, to the exclusion of economic and other considerations". However, Member States can exceptionally prohibit the use in their territory of medicinal products for human use, which "infringe objectively defi ned concepts of public policy and public morality".880.
