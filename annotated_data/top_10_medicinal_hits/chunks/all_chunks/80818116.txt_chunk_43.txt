All of them conflict with the men-tioned problem of peak symmetry of norfloxacin and this problem is differently eliminated with use of amines, gra-dient elutions, high column temperatures, expensive high quality columns employment etc.The aim of our study was to develop fast, simple ac-curate and robust HPLC method for determination of nor-floxacin in pharmaceutical dosage forms, yielding chro-matographic peak of norfloxacin with satisfying symme-try, without using gradient elution, high column tempera-tures and expensive high quality columns.Materials and methodsAmmonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4), 85% phosphoric acid and potassium hexafluorophos-phate (KPF6) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich, USA, whereas methanol, acetonitrile and 70 % perchloric acid (HClO4) were purchased from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. All the chemicals used were Ph.Eur. grade. The demineralized water was Stilman produced and had con-ductivity less than 1 uS.Common HPLC system was used, Varian Pro Star sys-tem with autosampler 410, Varian 325 dual-channel and Varian 335 photodiode-array detector, with ternary high pressure mixing pump, controlled by Galaxy software ver-sion 1.91.Following two chromatographic columns were tested: RP Select B 75 mm x 4 mm, 5 um and RP Select B 125 mm x 4 mm, 5 um, both products of Merck Darmstadt, Germany.Norfloxacin working standard and Norfloxacin film-coated tablets 400 mg were purchased from Replek Farm, Skopje, Macedonia.Test and standard solutions were prepared by dissolv-S2 PP 89196Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 195 - 196 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsing suitable content of the active substance or powdered film-coated tablets in solvent composed of 5% v/v aceto-nitrile and 95% v/v 0.1% v/v H3PO4, to concentration of 0.4 mg/ml.Results and discussionDuring development of appropriate chromatograph-ic method for quantification of norfloxacin with improved peak symmetry, we intended to investigate influence of participation of chaotropic salts in mobile phase constitu-tion. For this investigation we decided to use lower quality reversed HPLC column, RP Select B with two dimensions 75 mm x 4mm and 125 mm x 4 mm, with 5 um particles, manufactured by Merck Darmstadt, Germany. These col-umns have a matrix which is single end-capped and partial-ly base-deactivated silica particles with small, 60 nm wide pores. With these characteristics RP Select B is not appro-priate choice for column in chromatographic method for norfloxacin determination, but use of this column should better manifest the influence of appropriate mobile phase on peak symmetry.We performed two tests of same column matrix of RP Select B with different dimensions:1. Using RP Select B 75 mm x 4 mm with 5 um par-ticles, mobile phase flow rate of 1.1 ml/min, chromato-graphic column temperature of 32 degC, injection volume of 5 ul, UV detection at 277 nm, and mobile phase consisted of 30% v/v methanol and 70% v/v mixture of 0.13% w/v NH4H2PO4, 0.2% w/v KPF6 and 0.1% v/v HClO4 with pH value 2.39. The chromatogram obtained under these conditions showed norfloxacin peak with retention time ~2.9 minutes, height ~570 mAU and symmetry expressed as AsUSP ~1.25.2. Using RP Select B 125 mm x 4 mm with 5 um par-ticles, mobile phase flow rate of 1.0 ml/min chromato-graphic column temperature of 30 degC, injection volume of 5 ul, UV detection at 277 nm, and mobile phase consisted of 35% v/v methanol and 65% v/v mixture of 0.13% w/v NH4H2PO4, 0.2% w/v KPF6 and 0.1% v/v HClO4 with pH value 2.39.The chromatogram obtained under these conditions showed norfloxacin peak with retention time ~3.75 min-utes, height ~560 mAU and symmetry expressed as AsUSP ~ 1.2.With these results, the peak symmetry and retention correction features of potent chaotropes like KPF6 was confirmed as beneficial. In our case, peak retention was not a primary problem. The main problem was the peak sym-metry. According to theory and publication of Kazakievic and Lobrutto (2007), the beneficial features of the chaotrop KPF6 are more significant with use of acetonitrile instead of methanol. But in our case, use of KPF6 chaotrop showed much better peak symmetry correction benefit, than ex-tended peak retention. Other important thing to mention is that use of 0.1% v/v HClO4 contributes to peak symmetry too, since the ClO4- anions are also chaotropic, but in less-er extent than PF6- anions.Further improvements of peak symmetry and reten-tion can be achieved with increase of content of chaotropic agent KPF6, but it is not necessary to extent run time for insignificant increase of peak symmetry. Better peak sym-metry can be achieved with use of more expensive, new, high end-capped and well base-deactivated columns. Use of wider particle pore column is preferential when com-pared with 60 nm pores of RP Select B column.ConclusionNew approach in creating fast, simple, accurate and robust RP-HPLC method was developed, which is very useful in high-throughput analysis per day, in pharmaceu-tical quality control routine analysis of norfloxacin phar-maceutical dosage forms. Method can be further adjusted and adapted for other intents of analysis, bioequivalence testing, pharmacodynamic, forensic analysis and similar.ReferencesBera, K.A., De, K.A., Pal, B., 2014.

It is necessary to perform these studies in process of develop-ment the stability indicating method which can be applied latter for the analysis of samples generated from accelerat-ed and long term stability studies in proposed shelf life to ensure that all possible degradation products that may oc-cur in proposed shelf life in normal conditions of storage can be separated, detected and quantified (Djurdjevic et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2014; Sultana et al., 2011).Moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation antibiotic drug of the fluoroquinolone familly, with higher activity against Gram-positive pathogens including Streptococcus pneu-monie, than the other drugs from fluoroquinolone family (Dewania et al., 2011; Lalitha Devi and Chandrasekhar, 2009).The objective of the present study was to report the sta-bility of moxifloxacin in tablet formulations available on the local market, based on the information obtained from forced degradation studies, to develop and validate new stability-indicating HPLC method for quantitative analy-sis of moxifloxacin and its related substances in pharma-ceutical dosage form tablet and to develop LC-MS method for the characterization of new degradation products in ac-cordance with the information obtained from forced degra-dation studies. Materials and methodsThree different tablet formulations (Formulation A: MOXI film tablets 400 mg-ZADA Pharmaceuticals, For-mulation B: AVELOX film tablets 400 mg-Bayer, Formu-lation C: CENOMAR film tablets 400 mg-Hemofarm), purchased from the local market were tested. European Pharmacopoeia Reference Standards Moxifloxacin hy-drochloride CRS and Moxifloxacin for peak identification CRS were used. Analytically pure moxifloxacin was ob-tained from Nosch Laboratories Limited, India. All chemi-cals and reagents used were of HPLC-grade purity.A High Performance Liquid Chromatographic system (Thermo Surveyor HPLC) equipped with Finnigan Sur-veyor LC quaternary pump, Finnigan Surveyor Autosam-pler plus, Finnigan Surveyor PDA plus detector in isocrat-ic mode was used for the analysis.Experimental design was used to optimize experimen-tal conditions. The method was optimized by analysis of the samples generated during the forced degradation stud-ies. Experimental factors, independent variables, were se-lected as inputs and as dependent variables were study res-olution between typical peaks and retention factor of moxi-floxacin because latest eluted. To assess the impact of some experimental factors on the responses of the system it was applied central compos-ite design. The optimal chromatographic conditions were selected by calculating Desirability function.After optimizing the experimental conditions the sep-aration was conducted on a ZORBAX-SB Phenyl column (250x4.6 mm, 5 mm particle size) with mobile phase com-posed of methanol:buffer (0.5 g/L tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate, 1.0 g/L monobasic potassium dihydro-gen phosphate and 3.4 g/L phosphoric acid in water) in ra-tio 71:29, v/v; pumped at 1.5 ml/min flow rate. The column temperature was set at 50 degC and the detection at 293 nm using Diode Array Detector. LC-MS method was developed for characterization of degradation products using HYPERSIL GOLD PFP 150x4.6 mm, 5 mm column with mobile phase composed S2 PP 90198Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 197 - 198 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsof ammonium formate (20mM): acetonitril pH=4; (70:30, v/v ) pumped at 1 ml/min flow rate. The column tempera-ture was set at 25 degC and the detection at 295 nm using Di-ode Array Detector. The medicine was subjected to acid (4 mol/l HCl, 70 degC for 6 days) and base (4 mol/l NaOH, 50 degC for 6 days) hydrolysis, oxidative decomposition (3% H2O2), thermal and photolytic stress. Forced degradation studies were conducted on the ac-tive substance, placebo mixture and binary mixtures of moxifloxacin with the excipients from the tablet formula-tions, in the same stress conditions, to determine the origin of the formed degradation products.Results and discussionNew LC-MS compatible stability-indicating HPLC method for moxifloxacin was developed. Significant deg-radation was caused by acidic and basic conditions. The results were comparable in all tested tablet formulations. In the samples without stress impurities were not detected.Under basic conditions (4 mol/l NaOH, 50 degC for 6 days) two degradation products have been detected (RRT 0.5 min. and 0.6 min.) in all three tested tablet formulations. Under acidic conditions (4 mol/l HCl, 70 degC for 6 days) one degradation product (RRT 0.8 min.) was detect-ed with significant area in all three tablet formulations. In formulation B it one additional degradation product on RRT 1.3 min. was detected, while in formulation C two ad-ditional degradation products (RRT 0.4 min. and 1.3 min.) were detected.It was found that the degradation products formed in the presence of base are result of the interaction between moxifloxacin and excipients in the tablet formulation: lac-tose and cellulose, while the degradation products caused by acidic conditions are performed as a result of degrada-tion of the active substance moxifloxacin. Composition of formulation A and B included cellu-lose and lactose, while formulation C had only cellulose in its composition. All degradation products were identi-fied as unknown.ConclusionAn isocratic stability-indicating RP-HPLC method for quantification of moxifloxacin and its related substances in moxifloxacin tablets was optimized and validated. LC-MS method was found to be suitable for separation of deg-radation products formed under stress conditions. In all of the three tested tablet formulations unknown degradation products were found, which need to be identified.The developed LC-MS method can be used for fu-ture research which objective will be the identification of formed degradation products.ReferencesDewani, A.P., Barik, B.B., Kanungo, S.K., Wattyani, B.R.
