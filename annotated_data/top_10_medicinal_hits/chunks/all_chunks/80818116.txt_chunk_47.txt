Furthermore, it may not be evident to the public how a reduction in the funding of an OMCL (or the downsizing of an OMCL) may affect public and animal health protec-tion (PA/PH/OMCL (14) 123 R, 2015).Therefore, a common need for raising the national and wider awareness of the benefits of the OMCL and the GEON was acknowledged.Public relation effortsRecently, GEON began renewed efforts to strength-en its stakeholder-interaction strategies and its communi-cation activities so as to more effectively disseminate in-S2 PP 96210Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 209 - 210 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsformation on the benefits of having a strong OMCL Net-work in place for the independent surveillance of the qual-ity of medicines.Despite some earlier successes of GEON public rela-tion (PR) efforts towards the general public as well as in the relation with supranational bodies (PA/PH/OMCL (14) 123 R, 2015), it was envisaged that a new communications strategy is required for the GEON. There are various el-ements to this work, including the need to identify what key messages about OMCLs and the GEON need to be made and to what stakeholders. While the general public if of course a very important stakeholder, it is unclear at the present time exactly what PR activities should be directed towards the general public. It may be more beneficial to fo-cus communication strategies on those stakeholders direct-ly involved in regulatory, legal and funding activities.Best communication practicesIf a country is dedicated to strengthening Quality Man-agement (QM) & Quality Control (QC) systems, then each measure for developing the capacity of the national OM-CLs within national strategic programmes should be con-sidered. As the OMCLs are usually part of bigger organiza-tions, special efforts should be made to address the stake-holders that provide the OMCL directly with resources. This can be done by means of presenting data under-pinning the performance of OMCLs e.g. by highlight-ing particularities and/or added values. Each success sto-ry should be released to the public, so higher awareness amongst the concerned stakeholders is achieved.Each opportunity for joint national, bilateral and inter-national projects that facilitate recognition of the impor-tance of OMCLs and involvement in critical issues of the health care system should be utilized.Social network platforms should be populated with in-formation on regular OMCL activities and lessons learned on health hazardous issues, especially those affecting pa-tients directly (i.e. in case when medicine, medical devices or 'food supplements' are purchased from untrusted sourc-es, such as internet or teleshops).The best communication practices from each individu-al OMCL could help developing a common 'tool kit' on in-ternational level, which could in revert help OMCLs to bet-ter reposition themselves within their national competent authorities for the benefits of all. In this context the Euro-pean Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & Health-Care (EDQM), under the auspice of Council of Europe, has a central role in the process of strengthening the role of OMCLs and its Network, as it compiles the best com-munication practices from the GEON, and identifies key points to elaborate European wide strategy. Target partners in this respect would be: Co-ordination Group for Mutu-al Recognition and Decentralised procedures - Human and veterinary (CMDh and CMDv) within Head of the Medi-cine Agencies (HMAs), Committee for Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use (CHMP and CMVP) within European Medicine agency (EMA),etc.PerspectiveThe authors wish to highlight the importance of the work done by OMCLs within the national and international health systems, but also to point out that the role of OMCL is very often underestimated which as a consequence might result in negative impact on the global patient safety in par-ticular regarding the combat against substandard and falsi-fied medicines. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that other types of laboratories with comparable scope of activ-ities are experiencing similar pressure with respect to cost/resource cuttings. The aim of this paper is to motivate each OMCL and other quality control laboratories to consider activities which could help raising public awareness, and in particular the awareness of stakeholders which decide about and provide resources to these laboratories. The im-portance of investments to develop OMCL capacities in or-der to meet new analytical challenges against substandard and falsified medicines must become part of national strat-egies, as it would pronounce a benefit for the health system in a cost/effective way.ReferencesDirective 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, as amended (Article 19; Procedures relevant for marketing authorisation, Articles 111 and 114; Supervision and Sanctions) as amended.Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products, as amended (Article 23; Procedure for marketing authorisation, Articles 80 and 82; Supervision and Sanctions) as amended.PA/PH/OMCL (07) 89 14R, June 2015, GEON Terms of Reference - Annex 1: Definition, Role and Status of OMCLs of the GEON, GEON/EDQM - Council of Europe, Strasbourg.PA/PH/OMCL (14) 123R, March 2015, OMCL Public Relations Best Practices - Position Paper of the AdG GEON, AdG GEON/EDQM - Council of Europe, Strasbourg.Poster presentationsMacedonian pharmaceutical bulletin, 62 (suppl) 211 - 212 (2016)ISSN 1409 - 8695UDC: 615.015.4:519.87Short communicationMathematical modeling of drug dissolution from prolonged-release drug productBlagica Manchevska*, Packa Antovska, Irena Brashnarska, Sonja UgarkovicResearch and Development Institute, ALKALOID AD, Blv Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* bmanchevska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionThe process of dissolution is of fundamental impor-tance for the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of drug products. The process of drug release in an aque-ous body fluid includes different physical phenomena as wetting of the particle's surface, breakdown of solid state bonds, solvation, diffusion as well as convection in the sur-rounding bulk fluid. Drug release rate from modified re-lease drug products can be controlled by diffusion, deg-radation, swelling followed by diffusion and dissolution. Different mathematical models may be used as an instru-mental tool for understanding the drug release form dif-ferent drug delivery systems (Siepmann and Siepmann, 2013). Some of the models were used to explore and ex-plain the release mechanisms of prolonged-release drug product.Materials and methodsDissolution tests of prolonged-release tablets with BCS Class I have been performed, using basket appara-tus at 100 rpm, in 500 mL phosphate buffer with pH 6.8 at 37+-0.5 degC for 24 hours. Dissolution profiles were obtained by sampling 10 mL at 8 time points (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 hours). Quantification of the dissolved drug is performed with HPLC method with UV detection at 242 nm, mobile phase is solution of sodium edetate and acetic acid, meth-anol and acetonitrile (60:20:20 v/v/v), pump flow 2.0 mL/min, column temperature 40 degC and injection volume 100 mL. Mathematical modeling of the dissolution data was performed with DDSolver (Zhang et al., 2010). Three for-mulations with different rate-controlling excipients were evaluated. A number of mathematical models have been assessed for evaluation of drug release data: zero order, first-order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas, Hixon-Crowell, Hopfenberg, Peppas-Sahlin, Weibull and Gompertz.Results and discussionThe average values (in percentage) of the dissolu-tion profile of formulation 1 are: 7.78, 14.69, 26.87, 38.02, 48.22, 56.82, 64.87 and 97.71, formulation 2: 4.55, 8.71, 17.5, 27.88, 38.23, 50.64, 60.69 and 93.9 and formulation 3: 4.36, 8.84, 18.46, 26.94, 35.55, 45.12, 54.38 and 88.85.Concerning the model selection criteria, DDSolver provides a number of statistical criteria for evaluating the goodness of fit of a model, among which the most popular are adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adjusted), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Model Selection Criteri-on (MSC) (Zhang et al., 2010).The Adjusted Coefficient of Determination is an ad-justment for the Coefficient of Determination that takes into account the number of variables in a data set.AIC is a measure of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, rel-ative to each of the other models. When comparing mod-els with different numbers of parameters, the model with a lower AIC value can be considered to be the better model.MSC is a modified reciprocal form of the AIC and is independent of the scaling of the data points. When com-paring different models, the most appropriate model will be that with the largest MSC.Zero order kinetics describes the systems where the drug release rate is independent of its concentration and can be used to describe the dissolution of several types of modified release dosage forms and dissolution from dos-age forms that do not disaggregate and release the drug S2 PP 97212Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 211 - 212 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsslowly (assuming that area does not change and no equi-librium conditions are obtained) (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.91-0.98, AIC 46.85-61.05 and MSC 1.95-3.40.Dosage forms that follow first order dissolution pro-file, such as those containing water-soluble drugs in porous matrices, release the drug in a way that is proportional to the amount of drug remaining in its interior, in such way, that the amount of drug released by unit of time diminish-es (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.96-0.98, AIC 45.29-53.53 and MSC 2.82-3.70.Higuchi describes drug release as a diffusion process based in the Fick's law, square root time dependent and can describe drug dissolution from several types of mod-ified release dosage forms, such as some transdermal sys-tems and matrix tablets with water soluble drugs (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.87-0.94, AIC 56.84-63.97 and MSC 1.66-2.41.Korsmeyer-Peppas is exponential equation often used to describe the drug release from polymeric systems, when the release mechanism is not well known or when more than one type of release phenomena could be involved (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). The n-value from the Kors-meyer-Peppas model indicates (0.70-0.85) anomalous dif-fusion or nonfickian diffusion which refers to combination of both diffusion and erosion controlled rate release (Pep-pas 1985). R2adjusted is 0.98-0.99, AIC 35.76-46.04 and MSC 3.65-4.63.Hixon-Crowell model describes the release from sys-tems with a change in surface area and diameter of parti-cles or tablets. When this model is used, it is assumed that the release rate is limited by the drug particles dissolution rate and not by the diffusion that might occur through the polymeric matrix (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.98-1.00, AIC 28.81-46.03 and MSC 3.66-5.53.The release of drugs from surface-eroding devices with several geometries was analyzed by Hopfenberg who de-veloped a general mathematical equation describing drug release from slabs, spheres and infinite cylinders display-ing heterogeneous erosion (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001). R2adjusted is 0.99-1.00, AIC 19.69-37.60 and MSC 4.59-6.54.Peppas-Sahlin model (Zhang et al., 2010) demon-strates the following goodness of fit: R2adjusted 0.99-1.00, AIC 26.09-42.81 and MSC 4.01-5.83.Weibull model demonstrates the following goodness of fit: R2adjusted around 1.00, AIC -8.91 to 21.67 and MSC 6.36-9.72. This is an empiric model, not deducted from any kinetic fundament, therefore, could only describe, but does not adequately characterize, the dissolution kinetic proper-ties of the drug. This model is useful for characterization of release profiles of matrix type drug delivery (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001).The Gompertz model (Costa and Sousa Lobo, 2001) is suitable for characterization of release profiles of drugs having good solubility and intermediate release rates. R2ad-justed is 0.99-1.00, AIC 16.83-37.30 and MSC 4.63-6.86.ConclusionMathematical models are generally designed to devel-op new drug delivery systems based on the release charac-teristics, to predict the effect of design parameters on the resulting drug release rate, to optimize the release kinetics, to elucidate the underlying mass transport mechanisms, to accurately predict the drug release profile and improve the overall therapeutic efficacy and safety of these drugs.The mathematical models with better goodness of fit are Weibull, Gompertz, Hopfenberg, Peppas-Sahlin, Hix-on-Crowell and Korsmeyer-Peppas and they characterize the dissolution kinetic and help to better understand the underlying drug release mechanisms. Also the amount of drug release percent by each mechanism at each time can be also calculated.The drug release profiles from all formulations can be best expressed by Weibull's equation, as the plots showed highest goodness of fit. This is an empiric model that can describe the dissolution kinetic properties.The results from the mathematical modeling indicate that more than one type of release phenomena is involved. Hopfenberg model indicates that erosion is one of the re-lease mechanisms. Korsmeyer-Peppas model indicates that there is combination of both diffusion and erosion con-trolled rate release. Hixon-Crowell model includes disso-lution as one of the release mechanisms. When the pro-longed-release tablets come in contact with the dissolution medium, they take up water and swell, forming a gel lay-er around the matrix and simultaneously erosion occurs.ReferencesCosta, P., Sousa Lobo, J.M., 2001.

Exemestane is 6-methylenandrosta-1,4-di-ene-3,17-dione a newer steroidal aromatase inhibitor. It is an enzyme activated irreversible inhibitor of aromatase. It is orally available and highly selective for aromatase. Its structure reflects only minor structural modifications to the natural substrate, androstenedione. Plasma estrogen levels are reduced by 85% to 95% within 2 to 3 days, and ef-fects last 4 to 5 days. Exemestane does not inhibit any of the major cytochromes P450 and has essentially no interac-tion with steroid receptors, with only a very weak affinity for the AR. The 17-hydroxyexemestane reduction product, however, has much higher affinity for the AR than the par-ent (still several fold less than DHT, 0.28% for parent vs. 30% for metabolite).
