It is pharmacologically similar to gabapentin. Pregabalin is ap-proved for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neural-gia and for adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures. This drug has a specific chemical structure, without presence of any specific UV-chromophore, like, for exam-ple, cyclic structure with double bonds, absorptive group or bond in the molecule, which complicates its detection with UV absorbing detectors. Patil et al. (2015) have developed spectrophotometric method for determination of Pregabalin, based on conden-sation reaction of Pregabalin with p-dimethylaminobenz-aldehyde in an acidic medium, leading to formation of a complex that shows maximum absorbtion at 395.80 nm. There are also many HPLC methods with UV detec-tion. Some of them require precolumn chemical derivatiza-tion of Pregabalin, using 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as derivatiozation agent (Ahmadkhaniha et al., 2014). How-ever, their application for routine pharmaceutical quali-ty control of drug products is difficult and inappropriate. Among the other common HPLC/UV methods developed for this aim, the following deficiencies can be met: low ca-pacity peak (Kasawar and Farooqui, 2010), inappropriate UV absorbing mobile phase components having lowUV-cut off, such as ammonium acetate buffer (Balaji et al., 2014), highly asymmetric peaks (Ashu et al., 2011; Kanna-pan et al., 2010) and even not-acceptable declared sensitiv-ity (Saeed et al., 2014).The aim of this work was to overcome above men-tioned obstacles, and to develop HPLC method for Prega-balin determination in solid pharmaceutical dosage forms, for routine analysis, in quality control laboratories, in phar-maceutical industry. Materials and methodsAll the chemicals used were Ph.Eur grade. Acetoni-trile and sodium hydroxide were products of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, whereas potassium dihydrogen phos-phate and 37% hydrochloric acid was purchased from Sig-ma Aldrich, USA. The demineralized water was Stilman produced and had conductivity less than 1 uS. Pregabalin capsules and Pregabalin working standard were purchased from Replek Farm, Skopje, Macedonia.Analyzes were conducted on HPLC system Varian Prostar with ternary high pressure mixing pump, autosam-pler 410 with column oven and DAD 330 detector con-trolled by Varian Star software version 6.21 and UPLC sys-tem Shimadzu Nexera with low pressure mixing quaterna-ry pump, autosampler, column oven, controller and dual-channel UV-Vis detector, controlled by Lab Solutions soft-ware version 5.54. Following HPLC columns were used: - Hypersil C18 ODS 100 mm x 4 mm, 3 um (Thermo scientific, USA); - RP Select B 75 mm x 4 mm, 5 um (Merck Darmstadt, Germany);S2 PP 93204Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 203 - 204 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentations- Purospher C18e STAR 125 mm x 4 mm, 5 um (Merck Darmstadt, Germany);- Discovery C18 125 mm x 4,6 mm, 5 um (Su-pelco Bellefonte, USA).The final proposed chromatographic conditions are: Discovery C18 chromatographic column, mobile phase consisted of 7% v/v acetonitrile and 93% v/v of 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) with flow rate 1.0 mL/min, column tem-perature 30 oC and 20 uL injection volume.Test solution was prepared by dissolving 1 capsule in 500 mL volumetric flack and diluted with 0.1 M hydro-chloric acid to volume.Results and discussionThe choice of HPLC column had strong impact on Pre-gabalin peak height, shape and capacity. Therefore, during method development four different HPLC columns were tested: 3 um particle column Hypersil C18 ODS, RP Select B with 5 um, Purospher C18e STAR with 5 um and Dis-covery C18 with 5 um particles. Best results were achieved using Discovery C18 column matrix, which was somewhat expected from particles having 180 nm wide pores, well base deactivated (metal cations purified) and end-capped of free silanol groups of silica chromatographic matrix. Pu-rospher columns have highest purity (lowest quantity of metal cations) chromatographic matrix but the wide pore particles of Discovery yield higher and narrower peak of Pregabaline, which makes this column more appropriate for achieving good sensitivity of the method.Increasing the injection volume was another way to im-prove sensitivity, accompanied by creation of deeper base-line disturbances even when highly UV transparent mo-bile phase composition was used. Similarity between sam-ple solvent and mobile phase improved the chromatogram appearance, since the presence of water in sample always generates deep negative peaks when working at very low UV wavelength signal. It is essential to dissolve the sam-ple in mobile phase in aim to avoid negative peaks on the whole picture of chromatogram. Additionally, the method sensitivity could be decreased if the sample is additionally diluted with water or mobile phase. The use of UV-DAD detector enabled comparison of the increase of method sensitivity by lowering monitoring wave-length from 215 nm up to 200 nm. It was found out that sig-nal monitoring wavelength at 210 nm was adequate for most types of pharmaceutical analysis of Pregabalin in solid phar-maceuticals, i.e. for assay and dissolution determination. Pregabalin molecule has two pKa values, 4.2 and 10.6, corresponding to the carboxylic acid and the amine groups, respectively. Mobile phase buffer with pH = 7.0 was tested and yielded satisfying chromatohraphic peaks of the analyte with retention time ~ 2 - 5 minutes depending on the HPLC column characteristics and length and the exact ratio of the inorganic and organic part in the mobile phase composition. The optimal chromatographic conditions were ob-tained using Discovery C18 chromatographic column, mo-bile phase consisted of 7% v/v acetonitrile and 93% v/v of 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), and 20 uL injection volume. ConclusionThe method was found to be simple, fast and cost-ef-fective, thus suitable for high-throughput routine determi-nation of Pregabalin in solid dosage forms in pharmaceuti-cal quality control laboratories. The method could be fur-ther improved if needed for higher sensitivity and higher throughput of analysis per day. ReferencesAhmadkhaniza, R., Mottaghi, S., Zargarpoor, Souri, E., 2014.

Its chemical name is 5,6-dimeth-yl-benzimidazoyl cyanocobamide. It belongs to a group of cobalt-containing compounds, known as corrinoids (Eiten-miller et al., 2007; Hurst, 2002; NCBI). Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) functions as a coenzyme. It is involved in the red blood cells formation and nervous system functioning, in DNA synthesis and regulation, and also in fatty acid metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 is synthesized only by bacteria and it is pres-ent only in food bacterially fermented or obtained from an-imals that has this cobalamin from their gastrointestinal microflora (Institute of Medicine (US) Standing Commit-tee, 1998). Microbiological method is one of the oldest methods for measuring the concentration of Vitamin B12. Although this technique has developed through time, still it has sev-eral drawbacks such as: relatively low specificity, low pre-cision, it is time consuming and requires very well trained technicians. Several authors have developed different HPLC meth-ods for determination of Cyanocobalamin, alone, or in com-bination with other vitamins and/or active substances (Chen et al., 2010; Perveen et al., 2009; Radhika et al., 2012).Cyanocobalamin is the commercial form of Vitamin B12 and specifications are found in the Codex for usage as food, and in the USP and BP for pharmaceutical use. The official Pharmacopoeia monographs for Vitamin B12 pre-scribe UV-spectrophotometric assay determination, as an analytical procedure for quantification of our analyte of in-terest, at 361 nm.The aim of our work is to propose two different meth-ods for routine analysis of the active compound whether it is consisted in dietary supplement or pharmaceutical dos-age form, as an alternative to each other in quality control laboratories in pharmaceutical/chemical industry.Materials and methodsAll used chemicals were of Ph.Eur. quality and the demineralized water was Stilman produced and had con-ductivity less than 1 uS. Pottasium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4) and 85% phosphoric acid were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich, USA, whereas acetonitrile was purchased from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Cyanocobala-min working standard, the pharmaceutical dosage forms and dietary supplements were purchased from Replek Farm, Skopje, Macedonia.Spectrophotometric method includes "VARIAN Car-ry Win 50" UV-VIS-spectrophotometer, 1-cm quartz cell at wavelength range 190 - 750 nm, with resolution 0.5 nm and scan rate of 300 nm/min. The HPLC determination was performed on Vari-an Pro Star HPLC system, with autosampler 410, Varian 325 dual-channel and Varian 335 photodiode-array detec-tor, with ternary high pressure mixing pump, controlled by Galaxy software version 1.91. The test and standard solutions for both proposed methods were prepared by dissolving suitable amount of S2 PP 94206Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 205 - 206 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsthe active substance or powdered film-coated tablets in de-mineralized water, as solvent, to concentration of 0.02 mg/ml for spectrophotometric determination and 0.1 mg/ml for HPLC determination.Results and discussionCyanocobalamin is the most stable form of vitamin B12. It has optimum stability at pH range 4.0 - 4.5, and therefore the extraction is usually carried out in this range. Severe alkaline and acid conditions, ultraviolet (UV) or strong visible light, and oxidizing agents inactivate the vi-tamin (Eitenmiller et al., 2007; Hurst, 2002). Cyanocobalamin is water-soluble vitamin, therefore water is a good extraction solvent. In UV and visible spec-trophotometry, aqueous solutions of Cyanocobalamin ex-hibit maximums in UV and visible region at 278 nm, 361 nm, and 550 nm. The spectrophotometric method we pro-pose prescribes signal measurement at wavelength of 550 nm of aqueous solutions with concentration ~0.02 mg/ml. Spectrophotometric method for determination of Cyanoco-balamin has low cost and acceptable specificity in compar-ison with radio ligand assay. However, it is not suitable for complex samples, where the sensitivity is relatively low, so it is not used routinely for determination of Cyanocobala-min in combined pharmaceutical products.According to available literature, Vitamin B12 is a weak base that stays approximately neutral at pH from about 5 to 10. The pKa values reported are 3.3 and 9.3 (Trang, 2013). Since it is preferred to avoid use of mo-bile phase with pH in proximity of the pKa values of an-alytes, if possible up to at least +- 1 pH unit, we chose to use mobile phase containing buffer with pH ~2.5 and or-ganic constituent (acetonitrile) in variable amount, in or-der to achieve optimal retention of the analyte. The opti-mized chromatographic method uses mobile phase consist-ed of 13% v/v acetonitrile and 87% v/v (20 mM KH2PO4, buffer adjusted to pH = 2.5 with 85% phosphoric acid). The tests are performed on a LiChropher RP Select B chro-matographic column (125 x 4 mm with 5 um particles), with UV detection at 550 nm. Volume of injection used is 50 ul, with mobile phase flow rate of 1.5 ml/min.Cyanocobalamin peak elutes with retention time ~5 minutes, with symmetry expressed as AsUSP ~0.9.
