Macedonia* dijana.15623@student.ugd.edu.mkIntroductionDiabetes mellitus is a syndrome characterized by chronic hyperglycemia and disorder of the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fat associated with a relative or absolute lack of insulin secretion and insulin action. Diabe-tes is one of the most common endocrine disorders, with a tendency of increased growth. It is a consequence of mod-ern lifestyles and the increasing number of internal, genet-ically conditioned and external etiological triggers. Diabe-tes is not only medical but also economic and social prob-lem (Brunton, 2008).Diabetes mellitus - type 1 is a disease of the young people - children, adolescents and adults. Insulin is part of their daily treatment because without it the outcome is fa-tal (Haycox, 2004; Heise et al., 2004).Diabetes mellitus - type 2 covers 90% of all cases, 90% of insulin therapy, while the rest use the pill therapy. Average daily dose of insulin is about 40 IE (International Units) (Alberti and Zimmet, 1998).The optimal insulin therapy should induce physiolog-ical insulin secretion. Insulin analogues have different ab-sorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination in terms of human insulin. This enables the analogues to get approx-imately closer to the human insulin (Nathan et al., 2009).Insulin that are required for patients in the Munici-pality of Stip are obtained and issued by the hospital phar-macy at PHI Clinical Hospital Stip. Until 2012 year they were obtained under the Law on public procurement, through tenders organized by the hospital. Since 2012, in-sulins strips to measure blood sugar, insulin needles, pens and kits are obtained through centralized procurement by the Ministry of Health.The purpose of this paper is to realize the changes in the variety and number of consumed units of insulin PHI Clinical Hospital Stip given the type of mostly used insu-lin per producer, strips to measure blood sugar, insulin nee-dles, pens and whales in Stipdiabetes center in the period from 2011 to 2014.Materials and methodsThe research and evaluation of the spent insulin's is based on the data of the consumption of insulin in the peri-od from 2011 to 2014 received from the Hospital pharma-cy in PHI Clinical Hospital Stip.The data is arranged by type and origin of insulin prep-arations, summed by year and made a comparison of con-sumption and variety. The results are expressed in number of packages.Descriptive method was used in data processing.Results and discussionAccording to data from the Diabetes Centre in Stip, in-sulin's consumption in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 contin-ues to grow. The hospital has purchased various types of in-sulin, according to the events, and generics manufacturer.Insulin consumption in 2011 was 34932 insulins units from different manufacturers with different types of action, with 16 trade names. Over the coming years, the consump-tion increased. In 2012 was 36932 packages from 16 trade names, in 2013 increased to 41597 packages from 12 trade names, while in 2014 the consumption of insulin reaches up to 46460 from 11 trade names . The highest consumption in all four years has insulin NovoMix "30" / Flexpen 3 ml / 300, which is a generic Insulin aspart, and belongs to a group of S1 PP 3280Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 79 - 80 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsinsulin's with average-long acting and it is combined with long-acting insulin's. It's consumption in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was 9656, 13573, 18426 and 15950 respectively.Since 2013, there was reduced range of insulins used under the trade name and manufacturer, as a result of the centralized supply of insulin from the Ministry of Health. This measure is taken because of the steady rise in con-sumption of insulin, which is probably due to the increased number of patients with diabetes, early detection and time-ly same passage of patients with insulin dependent diabetes treated with insulin. With centralized procurement there is provided lower range of branded insulin, low prices, total costs and reliability in the supply of sufficient quantities to meet the increased needs.In the research there are processed the spending strips to measure blood sugar, needles and other accessories. In 2012 and 2013, we issued a number of different types of strips to measure blood sugar depending on the type of the glucometar. While in 2014 was issued only one type of strips for measuring blood sugar and it is called Trueressult. In 2012 there are issued 63600 boxes of strips to measure blood sugar, while in 2013 consumption increased by 29% and amounted to 89650. In 2014 there are issued 115620 strips to measure blood sugar levels from Trueressult and that consumption increased by 22%. The highest consump-tion of strips to measure blood sugar levels in 2012 are from Roche Accucheck Nano 1/50 and it was 28250.Consumption needle apparatus for measuring blood sugar in 2011 was 67711. In 2012 the use of the needles increased by 16.8% and amounted to 81391, in 2013 in-creased by 22.6% and amounted to 105178 needles. In 2014 we have reduced the use of needles by about 10% and it amounts to 94639 needles.The rising use of bands for measuring glucose in the blood and needle apparatus for measuring the sugar is part-ly due to the growing number of diabetics, and it is a part of a program of measures introduced by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia by introducing centralized pro-curement of insulin and stripes for measuring blood sugar.ConclusionConsumption of insulin in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 PHI Clinical Hospital Stip continues to grow. The highest consumption of fast-acting insulin, while the consumption of insulins intermediate - long action in the last two years completely replaced with insulins medium - long-acting combined with long-acting; Since 2013, decreased variety of insulins used un-der the trade name and the manufacturer, which is a re-sult of the centralized supply of insulin from the Minis-try of HealthIncreasing use of strips to measure blood sugar and needle apparatus for measuring glucose on blood level which is partly due to the growing number of diabetics, part of a program of measures introduced by the Govern-ment of the Republic of Macedonia by introducing central-ized procurement of insulin strips to measure blood sugar.By tracking the consumption of insulin improves the basics for quality procurement and reliable supply of qual-ity and reliable insulin.ReferencesAlberti, K.G., Zimmet, P.Z., 1998.

These types of failures may arise at any stage of the health care delivery process, and various policy documents have been published, stressing their frequency and impact. How-ever, despite the growing interest indecreasing the rate of medication errors, a low level of awareness and knowledge has been noticed among health care professionals. There-fore, this paper aims to provide a short review of the con-cept of medication errors, with a special attention given to their definitions, types and causes, as well as to the cur-rent regulatory requirements regarding their reporting and monitoring in the Republic of Serbia.Material and methodsA comprehensive search of available electronic data-bases Medline and Web of Science has been carried out from database inception to December 2014. A following combination of key words has been used: (medication er-rors OR adverse drug events) AND (definitions OR taxon-omy); (medication errors OR adverse drug events) AND (incidence OR frequency OR types OR causes OR classi-fication). Additionally, applicable laws and regulations of the Republic of Serbia related to the issue of errors' report-ing and monitoring have been examined.Results and discussionPatient safety and medication errors represent a significant part of the quality of health care, as a wider concept. A 1999 landmark report "To err is human" brought this issue to the forefront for both professional and general public, stating that "At least 44,000 people, and perhaps as many as 98,000 people, die in hospitals each year as a result of medication error that could have been prevented" (Kohn et al., 1999). In addition to such morbidity and mortality rates, it was estimated that medication errors resulted in considerable health expenditures as well. Various definitions of medication errors have been identified, such as the one from the National Coordinating Council for Medication Errors Reporting and Prevention (NCCMERP), stating that this type of failures represents "any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the health care professional, patient, or consumer" (NCCMERP, 1998). However, authors have identified heterogeneity of definitions and terminology in this area, which significantly hampers the synthesis of existing scientific knowledge and a comparison of the results. Therefore, it would be necessary to develop an international taxonomy, in order to facilitate errors' reporting and the synthesis of data obtained. Medication errors may occur at any stage of the medication delivery process, such as prescribing, dispensing and administration. Prescribing errors include prescribing faults, a type of failure which results in an irrational, inappropriate or ineffective prescribing, and prescription errors, as omissions in filling the prescription that results in erroneous specifying one or more data. The S1 PP 3382Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 81 - 82 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationssecond type of potential failures are dispensing errors, which could be defined as any discrepancy between the medication order and delivery made by pharmacists in a hospital or community pharmacy setting. According to the study results, these errors occur at a rate of 51.5 million out of 3 billion prescriptions filled annually in the United States i.e. 4 per day in a pharmacy filling 250 prescriptions daily, respectively (Bootman et al., 2006), whereas the commonest types are dispensing the wrong medicine, strength, form or quantity, as well as improper labeling. Lastly, administration errors include failures made by nurses during administration of medicines to hospitalized patients, as well as errors made by patients during the use of medicines. This is mostly caused by a low level of adherence, health illiteracy, inadequate way of drug storage and accidental medication mix-ups caused by visually/audio similar names and/or packages. Elderly patients are considered to be particularly vulnerable, owing to the polypharmacy, physical disability and cognitive limitations.Various critical system elements that may have an im-pact on medication errors occurrence have been identified, such as incomplete collection and use of demographic and clinical patient data; insufficient health care professionals' knowledge of medications; poor and ineffective commu-nication among health care providers and the absence of collaborative practice; sound-alike/look-alike medications and/or their improper labeling; inadequate working envi-ronment such as poor lighting, high noise levels, cluttered work space and work overload; inadequate and/or insuffi-cient health professionals'training about interventions for the safety improvement; the lack of adequate education of patients regarding their own health status and treatment; and finally, the lack of supportive strategies for reporting, analysis and reduction of medication errors in health care facilities (Cohen, 2007).Nowadays, the underreporting of medication errors has been recognized as a tremendously significant prob-lem. In the Republic of Serbia, this aspect of risk manage-ment has been regulated by the Rulebook on indicators of quality of health care (Official Gazette of RS, No 49/2010). All health care providers have been obliged to monitor and report defined indicators, including those related to the pa-tient safety, such as the rate of adverse drug reactions re-ported, the number of prescriptions with administrative and professional mistake (prescribing faults and prescrip-tion errors), as well as the rate of dispensing the wrong drug. However, a significant trend of missing data regard-ing the patient safety indicators has been noticed in annual reports on improving the quality of health care, due to in-adequate reporting. Owning to this fact, the same conclu-sion that our health care professionals do not realize the importance of failures' monitoring and reporting has been drawn for several years, emphasizing the necessity of rais-ing their awareness related to the significance of recording all failures incurred so as to prevent them from happening again. In addition, it is necessary to conduct research on the types and causes of medication errors, which has not yet been undertaken in Serbia. This may allow the proac-tive detection of systemic weaknesses and implementation of appropriate risk-reduction strategies.ConclusionRaising awareness of the issue of medication errors has resulted in an increase in the number of studies on in-cidence, types and causes of prescribing, dispensing and administration errors. However, the identified heterogene-ity of operational definitions disables the synthesis of ex-isting findings in this area. Furthermore, even though risk management phases, including monitoring and recording of medication errors, have been regulated in many coun-tries, experience from Serbia indicates the necessity of fur-ther health care providers' education regarding these activ-ities, since underreporting still remains one of the most sig-nificant barriers for the prospective risk management and errors prevention.ReferencesBootman, J.
