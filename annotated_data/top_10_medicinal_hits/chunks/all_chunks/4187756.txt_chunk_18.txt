Rather, what I argue is that herbal medicine in Vietnam, as it always has been, is under constant revision and it is currently being bio-politicised so as to contribute to the protection and promotion of the public health 74 It is important to underline that these requirements are still very new in Vietnam, and it is in no way the case that all industrially produced herbal remedies have been subject to them. The point is rather that in the past decade or so, clinical trials have become an increasingly important component of the government's traditional medicine strategy (see also Vietnam. Ministry of Health. 2003). 137 of both rural and urban populations. What I would not argue, however, is that such a transformation has to be explained in terms of some kind of an ontological de-authentication of 'real' Vietnamese traditional medicine, which as it happens emerged out of a specifically Chinese medicine, was consequently colonially challenged by a 'western' biomedicine, and is currently being reclaimed as a specifically Vietnamese medicine in alliance with modern medicine. Which of these three forms of medicine - an 'original' traditional Vietnamese medicine as developed out of Chinese medicine in the 15th to 18th centuries, a colonial biomedicine in the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, or a modernised Vietnamese medicine as developed in the past fifty years or so - is the 'safest', 'best' or 'most effective' is a question that is far removed from the scope of this dissertation not to mention my own competences, but what I have shown up to now is how the answer to exactly that question is socio-historically dependent as seen in the different practices, tactics and strategies that have historically emerged around this question over time. In the United Kingdom, indigenous herbal medicine is also described both in terms of a particular (or alternative) 'way of thinking' about health and healing (often described as "holistic"), as well as in terms of physiological effects in "certain organs or systems of the body" during the course of a treatment (NIMH 2004b). That is to say, the efficacy of herbal medicines is accounted for through both symbolic and physiological mechanisms of action. On the symbolic side, the patient's active participation in the healing process is often highlighted as crucial by herbalists, as is the notion of 'lifestyle'. Holistic herbal healing is far from being only about taking herbal remedies for different symptoms or conditions, but rather the healing process involves engaging patients and assisting them to understand that their lifestyle - including aspects of diet, stress, exercise, etc. - is the key to active maintenance of balance, harmony and thereby health. At a consultation, a herbalist will seek to identify the "underlying cause of the problem... which is [what is] treated, rather than the symptoms alone [as] treatment or suppression of symptoms will not rid the body of the disease itself" (NIMH 2004b). To do so "the Herbalist will take notes on the patient's medical history and begin to build a picture of the person as a whole being" (ibid.). Only then will treatment be recommended and, as described by the NIMH, herbal remedies are themselves 'merely': used to 'feed' and restore to health those parts which have become weakened... Treatment may [also] include advice about diet and lifestyle as 138 well as the herbal medicine. As the body is strengthened so is its power and ability to fight off disease and when balance and harmony are restored, health will be regained. [Hence], healing is a matter of teamwork with patient, practitioner and the prescribed treatment all working together to restore the body to health. (NIMH 2004b) In other words, the role of the Western herbalist is to facilitate the restoration of any imbalances or disharmonies (often seen as resulting from disobliging lifestyles), a process that it is imperative that the patient symbolically ascribes to as well. As put by NIMH herbalist Simon Mills in his Essential Book of Herbal Medicine, it is about offering patients "imagery and models of their illness that they can relate to", as well as forming a "common language allowing patient and physician to understand each other better" (1993: 21, 32). But again, to suggest that the efficacy of herbal medicine in the United Kingdom is confined to a symbolic realm, that restores cognitive order to a patient by allowing him or her to understand the underlying cause of imbalances and disharmonies, would be to neglect a central tenet of western herbal medicine, i.e. helping the body to help itself by strengthening its own vis medicatrix naturae. As put by Mills (1993: 150): the modern herbalist does not claim descent from the shaman... It is, of course, always the case that the therapist powerfully influences the therapy, but as in other crafts it is the nature of the material, the character of the remedies, that is the determining factor. There is a vast and growing body of research in the United Kingdom and Europe that in the past decades has begun documenting the extent of the "independent activity of the herbs themselves" through clinical trials and scientific research (Mills and Bone 1999: xviii). This aspect of western herbal medicine is increasingly referred to as 'rational phytotherapy',75 or the science of herbal medicine. From the previous chapter we can recall that as late as the 1980s, health authorities in the United Kingdom were slating herbalists "for clinging to outworn historical authority and for not assessing their drugs in terms of today's knowledge", and what many see as an increasing rationalisation of indigenous British herbal medicine could well be seen as a concrete response to this. The number of herbal medicines being clinically tested for efficacy is growing by the day, something not unrelated to what herbalist Andrew Chevallier has described as "justified... scepticism about claims for new 'wonder' treatments" (1999: 36), and the phytochemical search for the (multiple) active ingredients that might be responsible for any observed clinical effects 75 phyto being the Greek word for plant. 139 of medicinal herbs or remedy mixtures has become equally intensive, as we will see in the following chapter. Having said this, just as has been the case in the context of many developing countries such as China or Vietnam, this increasing rationalisation of the United Kingdom's traditional herbal medicine has generated much debate as to whether or not this is in fact stripping an authentic herbal tradition of its 'real' value. One of the fears that is often raised is that blind faith in randomised controlled trials, which rely on standardised treatments for standardised conditions, neglects the individualised and holistic herbal approach to treatment, as it is argued that "current medical research generally concerns itself only with measuring events and data divorced from the human being, ignoring the latter's immensely powerful forces for change and development in defiance of the clearest signs to the contrary" (Mills 1993: 237). Another fear, which will be addressed in detail in chapter 6, concerns the search for single active ingredients to account for pharmacologic action, which it is argued is in direct contrast to a herbalist's (as opposed to a rational phytotherapist) preference for using not only single whole plant extracts where a plant's many different active compounds act synergistically together, but also at times many different whole plant extracts together (so-called synergistic polypharmacy). I will now turn my attention to the rise of Heantos and St. John's Wort to prominence during the 1990s. Both cases provide ample entries to the liabilities and possibilities of what some regard as an ambivalent modernisation of traditional herbal medicine. Interestingly, in both cases, establishing clinical efficacy has been a priority and only once the first indications of positive clinical effects were 'confirmed' did focus shift towards identifying pre-clinical biological mechanisms-of-action. This priority of establishing efficacy 'once and for all' should partly be understood in terms of the legacy of superstition or "outworn historical authority" that herbal medicine has endured in both countries, but it must also be placed firmly within a context of growing pressures to establish clinical efficacy above and beyond placebo in general, whatever the therapy in question, which has become one of the mantras of 'evidence-based medicine' (see Willis and White 2004). 140 Thresholds of efficacy - Heantos and the accumulation of evidence in the treatment of drug addicts When the first trials with Heantos were authorised by the Ministry of Health in the early 1990s, it was probably not with the expectation that Tran Khuong Dan and his herbal brew against addiction would become global headline news.76 In fact, if the general scepticism of many biomedical doctors towards especially traditional Chinese medicine was anything to go by,77 then there was probably good reason to believe that any claims to efficacy made for Heantos would be dismissed as unserious outside of Asia. But all this was to change in 1994 when anecdotal news emerged of a trial on 110 morphine-addicted war invalids at the Hoang Long Rehabilitation Centre which suggested that following treatment with Heantos, up to 80% of these invalids had stopped picking up their free monthly rations of morphine provided to them by Vietnam's health authorities. Dr. Ha Anh, Head of the Institute of Orthopedics Science and Rehabilitation of Wounded Veterans and Invalids, who had followed the treatment of this group of invalids concluded in a report to the Ministry of Health that the "importance of Heantos is its ability to prevent re-addiction and to appease the patient's craving for drugs" (Vietnam. Institute of Orthopedics Science and Rehabilitation for Wounded Veterans and Invalids. 1996). This anecdotal indication of Heantos' efficacy in treating addiction was compelling enough for American scientists at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Chemical Dependence Unit to engage in initial discussions with Vietnamese scientists in January 1995. Having determined that samples of Heantos contained no substitute addictive substances, Johns Hopkins' scientists concluded that initial indications of Heantos' potential as an addiction treatment "warrant further study" (Jasinski 1997). Since then, the ongoing quest to validate the efficacy of Heantos in the treatment of addiction has pretty much read like concerted efforts to gradually notch up "levels of evidence" as endorsed by the WHO (2000b) (see Table 2), albeit not without numerous complications and contestations. In the past fifteen years or so, the most significant of efforts to validate the efficacy claims of Heantos in the treatment of addiction have included: a whole series of 'quasi- 76 News of Heantos broke internationally when the UN Development Programme and the government of Vietnam announced a joint project to fund trials in 1997 (see Boggan 1998; Graves 1997; Larimer 1997; The Washington Times 1997). 77 For example, while Traditional Chinese Medicine has without doubt received greater attention in recent years outside of the region, its 'alternative' philosophical base and diagnostic approach led it to be classified in the 'unscientific' Group 3 of the House of Lords Select Committee CAM report. 141 experimental' studies carried out on "thousands" of patients at various treatment centres in northern Vietnam (including the above-mentioned trial with 110 morphine-addicted war invalids), treatment of a number of non-Vietnamese addicts from Europe and America to secure anecdotal testimonials, a series of controlled studies carried out under the auspices of an official United Nations-funded "Re-evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of the Anti-drug Medication Heantos" initiated in 1997, a report by a "group of international experts" who visited Vietnam in 1999, and, most recently, preparation of a double-blind randomised controlled trial to be carried out at the University of Essen's Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy. The involvement of the United Nations to "serve as protective umbrella" and as "venture capitalist" in the scientific development of Heantos in 1996 was pivotal in securing the initial funds required for clinically testing and scientifically investigating Heantos both within Vietnam and internationally (Morey 1997; UNOPS 1998a: 17). Before that, Heantos had been preliminarily approved for use in a number of treatment centres throughout Vietnam, and according to government officials, in the first half of the 1990s, Heantos was "used in the treatment of about 4,000 addicted patients... In practically all cases, the medication proved successful in detoxifying the patients, eliminating their withdrawal symptoms and stopping their cravings after a treatment of 5 to 7 days" (Tran 1997). Yet, as American scientists were quick to point out, documentation of these early 'quasi-experimental' trials with Heantos did not comply with "internationally recognised" standards. Nevertheless, Dr. Donald Jasinski of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine justified UN investment in further research by arguing that "reports from Vietnam on the utility of Heantos cannot be dismissed because investigations did not meet U.S. standards" (Jasinski 1997). Upon signing a cost-sharing agreement with the United Nations, the government of Vietnam underlined that it was "convinced of the potential of Heantos as an anti-drug medication", and that "it expects that the efficacy of Heantos can be further substantiated" through international cooperation (Tran 1997). In light of such growing scientific interest in his herbal remedy, Tran Khuong Dan decided to join forces with phytochemists at Hanoi's Institute of Chemistry in June 1996, which has since been the central coordinating agency in the ongoing scientific development and clinical validation of Heantos. From this point onwards, Heantos has been subjected to an increasingly "rigorous" programme aimed at clinically validating its efficacy. It is possible to identify two parallel 142 strategies for this validation process - on the one hand, a national effort to re-evaluate Heantos according to raised Vietnamese testing standards, and on the other, targeted efforts to gain international recognition. On the national side, although Vietnamese health officials had already indicated that they were convinced of Heantos' efficacy based on their initial experiences with it in various treatment centres, the introduction of new safety and efficacy standards for industrially produced herbal remedies in 1996, as well as the increased international attention that Heantos was receiving, led the Ministry of Health to call for the formation of a scientific advisory committee comprised of traditional medicine experts, pharmacologists, psychiatrists, drug treatment clinicians and health officials to oversee an official re-evaluation of the safety and efficacy of Heantos in October 1997 (Vietnam. Ministry of Health. 1997). It was this committee that was responsible for the designing of protocols for the first controlled clinical trials with Heantos, which were carried out at Hanoi's Central Psychiatric Hospital on 28 patients in the fall of 1998 and on a further 58 patients in 1999 and 2000. Table 2: Levels of evidence78 Level Type of evidence Ia Evidence obtained from meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials Ib Evidence obtained from at least one randomized controlled trial IIa Evidence obtained from at least one well-designed controlled study without randomization IIb Evidence obtained from at least one other type of well-designed quasi-experimental study III Evidence obtained from well-designed non-experimental descriptive studies, such as comparative studies, correlation studies and case control studies IV Evidence obtained from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of respected authorities The objectives of these first two controlled trials were "to determine the appropriate dose of Heantos to alleviate withdrawal from drug addiction", "to preliminarily assess the efficacy of Heantos in stopping addiction" and finally "to compare the effect of Heantos to that of ATK [neuroleptic] therapy in stopping addiction" (Vietnam. Institute of Chemistry. 1999). 78 Taken from World Health Organization (2000b: 39) who in turn credit USA Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. This table is sometimes referred to as the 'Cochrane hierarchy'. 143 This was no short order, as the initiation of a formalised validation procedure inevitably entailed a number of definitional negotiations amongst committee members regarding the nature of the condition to be treated, diagnostic criteria for identifying potential trial subjects, as well as the clinical outcome measures that could confirm whether or not a patient was in the process of overcoming/had overcome the condition under scrutiny. In other words, the committee's task was to build up very practical templates of healing, which would indicate a measurable teleological chronology from pathological to normal, from an undesirable condition (toxicated and addicted) to a desirable state (detoxified and not craving). Such templates have become crucial for determining what role a particular healing intervention has in either speeding up a healing process or in making that process 'more comfortable'. The building up of standardised "clinical outcome measures" for all kinds of conditions has become a discipline in itself with the rise of randomised controlled trials and evidence-based medicine in the latter half of the 20th century. And, since drug addiction has become a key object of clinical study in recent decades (see Vrecko 2006), the business of developing and fine tuning diagnostic criteria for dependency on the one hand and templates of chemical non-dependency and non-craving on the other has proliferated. For example, ever since Himmelsbach proposed his pioneer withdrawal scale in 1942, a whole range of clinical rating scales and diagnostic criteria for substance dependence have emerged, including: DSM-IV criteria, ICD-10 criteria, Profile of Mood States (POMS), Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), Weak Opiate Withdrawal Scale (WOWS), Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS), Observed Opioid Withdrawal scores, Withdrawal Symptom Rating Scale, Craving Rating Scale, Addiction Severity Index, Wang Scale, and the Visual Analogue Scale to name a few. What is clear is that the scientific committee responsible for re-evaluating the efficacy of Heantos could not have carried out their mandate without such templates. The protocols designed by the committee included admission criteria based on International Classification of Diseases-10 and positive TLC urine tests, and a range of clinical outcome measures based on a modified Himmelsbach withdrawal scale, Beck and Zung psychological tests for depression, biological tests (renal function and liver blood enzyme), haematology tests as well as electroencephalograms. It was this assemblage of clinical outcome measures that made up the initial Heantos healing template - a set of quantifiable and measurable indicators that could be gleaned from clinical observations, biological tests as well as a series of standardised, solicited subjective accounts from trial participants throughout their 144 protocolled 10-day treatment. Himmelsbach withdrawal scores were calculated from the 'objectively' observable and 'subjectively' extractable manifestation of a set of 12 withdrawal symptoms including yawning, craving, diarrhoea, insomnia, goose flesh and paraesthesia (see Plate 1).
