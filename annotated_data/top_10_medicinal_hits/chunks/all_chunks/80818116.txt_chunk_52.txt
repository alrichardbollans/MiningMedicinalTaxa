Var-ious procedures have been developed for the synthesis of the drug during which different process-related impuri-ties are formed. Isolation and structural identification has been achieved for many of the synthesis-related impurities (Bayer, 2000; Kumar et al., 2004, Petersen, 2006). A num-ber of methods have been developed for the determination of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and its related substances, based on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatog-raphy (HPLC) (Dewani et al., 2011; Djurdjevic et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2014). Ultra high performance liquid chroma-tography (UPLC) is a relatively new technique which of-fers several advantages over conventional high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), especially substantially de-creased time of analysis and reduced solvent consumption while retaining chromatographic efficiency, resolution and sensitivity (Swartz, 2005). The aim of our study was to de-velop and optimize an UPLC method for determination of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and its related impurities.Materials and methodsMoxifloxacin hydrochloride and its five impurities: (1) 8-hydroxy quinolonic acid, (2) 8-methoxy quinolonic acid, (3) ethyl quinolonic ester, (4) 8-hydroxy moxifloxacin and (5) N-methyl piperazine were used for this study. Stock so-lutions were prepared in methanol at the concentration lev-el of 1 mg/ml for moxifloxacin and 0.1 mg/ml for each of the selected impurities. The resolution solution of moxi-floxacin and its related impurities was prepared by diluting the stock solutions in mobile phase A, to the final concen-tration of 0.4 mg/ml for each compound. The chromatographic analysis was conducted on Shi-madzu Nexera UPLC system equipped with PDA detector. The separation was performed on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18, 50 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mm chromatographic column, using gradient elution of mobile phase B (%): 0-2 min: 19%; 2-6 min: from 19% to 67%; 6-8 min: from 67% to 27%; 8-8.1: from 27% to 19%; 8.1-9 min: 19%. Mobile phase A was a mixture of aqueous phase pH=2.2 (containing 0.16 mol/L phosphoric acid and 1 ml/L trifluoroacetic acid, adjusted to pH 2.2 with triethylamine) and methanol (85:15 v/v). Mo-bile phase B consisted of a mixture of methanol and water (80:20 v/v). The column temperature was maintained at 50 @C and the flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. Injection volume was 5 mL and the total run time for analysis was 9 min. Moxi-floxacin and its impurities were recorded at 296 nm.Results and discussionOptimization of the method started by varying the composition and the pH of the mobile phase, using isocratic and gradient elution. Two aqueous mobile phases were ex-amined, one containing potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and the other containing phosphoric acid, at three pH values (2.2; 5.5; 6.0), maintaing the column temperature at 25 @C. The studied compounds were partially separated by isocrat-ic elution, therefore to achieve full separation, gradient elu-tion was used. The best separation and peak symmetry were observed with the aqueous phase containing phosphoric S2 PP 106230Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 229 - 230 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsacid at pH=2.2, therefore it was selected for further analy-sis. Under these conditions, 8-methoxyquinolonic acid and ethylquinolonic ester impurities were not resolved at all. In order to achieve their separation, column temperature was gradually increased. Satisfactory resolution was achieved at 50 @C. In order to obtain adequate sensitivity the injec-tion volume was also varied. Optimal results were obtained using injection volume of 5 mL. According to the litera-ture data, the wavelength was optimized in the range from 290-296 nm (Djurdjevic et al., 2009). The wavelength of maximum absorption was selected according to the record-ed UV spectrum of the moxifloxacin hydrochloride, which was 296 nm. Different diluents for preparation of the reso-lution solution were tested as well. The best peak shape of the studied compounds was observed using mobile phase A as diluent. The final step in the optimization process was the selection of the best conditions for gradient elution. There-fore, the ratio of mobile phase B, the flow rate and the gra-dient steps were optimized. Best peak shape and resolu-tion with optimal run time was acquired using gradient elu-tion of mobile phase B (%): 0-2 min: 19%; 2-6 min: from 19% to 67%; 6-8 min: from 67% to 27%; 8-8.1: from 27% to 19%; 8.1-9 min: 19%. Using the finally optimized chro-matographic conditions a critical resolution between 8-me-thoxy quinolonic acid and ethyl quinolonic ester of 1,8 was obtained. All the peaks of the studied compounds have a good symmetrical shape, with maximum tailing factor of 1.3 for the peak of 8-hydroxy moxifloxacin. The number of theoretical plates (tp) shows suitable column efficiency, with a minimum NTP of 1770 tp/column for the peak of N-methyl piperazine. The obtained values for signal to noise (minimal value of 11.9 for the peak of 8-hydroxy moxi-floxacin) confirmed the sensitivity of the method. All of the aforementioned parameters indicate on a satisfactory per-formance of the chromatographic system.ConclusionAn UPLC method for quantitative determination of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and its related impurities was developed and optimized. The method is simple and sen-sitive and the studied impurities were separated with ex-cellent resolution in only 9 minutes. The results from our study indicate that, after proper validation, the proposed method could be used for routine analysis of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and its related substances as an active ingre-dient and in pharmaceutical dosage forms as well.ReferencesBalfour, J.A., Wiseman, L.R., 1999.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* vpopovska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionFluoroquinolone as active compound belongs to a class of synthetic antimicrobial agents. Fluoroquinolones absorb radiation energy in the ultraviolet range. A loss of antibacterial activity was observed after UV exposure, as a result of changed colour, decreased assay and increased degradation products, suggesting photodegradation of the active substance. Regarding to this, selection of an appro-priate packaging to protect the drug product from light and a storage advice is necessary to be established.The photodegradation itself has not yet been docu-mented, as well as no information has been so far provided on the nature of the photoproducts. For some fluoroquino-lones, however, metabolites have been identified with re-duced antibacterial activity (Eva-Maria et al., 1993).In order to demonstrate that appropriate light expo-sure does not lead to unacceptable changes in dosage form, photostability testing was performed on the drug solution, as part of formal stability study ICH guideline Q1A (R2) (Blessy et al., 2014). Materials and methodsPhoto stability study was conducted according to ICH guideline Q1B "Photo stability Testing of New Drug Sub-stances and Products"- Option 1. Testing was performed on one batch of Alkaloid's drug product, solution packed in glass colorless ampoules as primary packaging and cardboard boxes as secondary packaging, using following methods:Determination of colour of solution: Ph.Eur 2.2.2 method and visual methodDetermination of assay and related and degradation compounds of the drug product: validated in-house HPLC methods.The formulation was examined at confirmatory stor-age conditions: exposure time in the visible range is 7.1 hours, which corresponds to an illumination of 1.2 million lux hours and in the UV range 2.9 hours, which corresponds to an integrated near ultraviolet energy of 200 Wh/m2.In first phase of photostabilty study, samples and pla-cebo, were exposed outside the immediate pack, placed in a quartz Erlenmeyer's with stoppers, alongside with pro-tected sample and placebo (solutions placed in amber glass volumetric flasks) used as a dark control to evaluate the contribution of thermally induced change.In the second phase, the samples and placebo were ex-posed in primary packaging to the same conditions.In the last, third phase, the samples and placebo were exposedin the secondary packaging as intended for mar-keting, also to the same conditions.After treatment, samples were examined for any changes in physical properties: i). colour of solution with visual meth-od; ii). determination of assay with HPLC method and iii). determination of degradation products with HPLC method.Results and discussionIn this study, photo stability of the drug product and degradation pathways of the active substance was fully de-terminate and understood. After the exposure for 2.9 hours to an integrated near ultraviolet energy of 200 Wh/m2, the assay of the active component was slightly decreased in both samples, the sam-S2 PP 107232Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 231 - 232 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsples outside of primary packing and samples in the prima-ry packaging. The decrease in the assay was followed with changed levels of impurity amount significantly for the specified impurity C, susceptible to light degradation (Hani et al., 2015; Mohammad and Zaynab, 2014; Ummeet al., 2013) which has increased to 0.43 and 0.47%, respectively.All samples have shown change in colour, compared with Ph.Eur. Reference standard solution GY4, used for determination of the colour.After the exposure for 7.1 hours to an illumination of 1.2 million lux hours in the visible range, the obtained re-sults from the opened samples and samples in the primary packaging were very similar. The assay of the active com-ponent was decreased to 97.82% and 97.50% respective to the increased amount of the specified impurity in the lev-el above the qualification threshold, 0.76% and 0.74%, re-spectively. Also, both samples have shown change in the colour of the drug product.No changes were noticed in the amount of the un-known impurities in all treated samples at end of exposure. Alongside with the drug product, placebo solution was also stressed in order to exclude those impurities that are not degradation products, which was found stable during the photo stability study.In the dark control samples and samples in the second-ary packaging, no changes have been observed at the end of exposure period.Data review of the tests on the exposed drug product outside the immediate packaging as well as in the primary packaging suggest that the drug product is sensitive to light and should be kept in the secondary packaging. The sec-ondary packaging, cardboard box, provides sufficient pro-tection, where the physical properties, assay and impurity levels are comparable to the untreated samples.ConclusionFrom the results for colour, assay and related and deg-radation products, obtained from conducted photo stabil-ity study on the drug product, it has been concluded that the drug product, containing fluoroquinolone, is suscepti-ble to photo degradation and loss of antibacterial activity. No photo degradation was observed at the third phase of performed study, confirming that product should be kept in its original package in order to be protected from light.With regard to data presented, the SmPC and label-ling sections for the drug product should be amended with a storage advice: 'Store in the original package to protect from light'.ReferencesBlessy, M., Ruchi, D.P., Prajesh, N., Prajapati, Y.K.A. 2014.
