DNA samples from 1524 clopidogrel-treated patients un-dergoing PCI were genotyped, ADP - induced platelet ag-gregation was assessed and the clinical impact of the ge-netic variant was investigated by comparison of genotype frequencies in a registry of 66 cases with definite drug - eluting stent thrombosis versus an ST-free control cohort (n = 1408). The aggregation did not differ across geno-type groups, and platelet aggregation values were simi-lar and numerically lower in homozygous T-allele carri-ers compared to the remaining patients. The genotype dis-tribution did not differ between case subjects and control subjects. Among the 66 ST case subjects, 19 were carri-ers of the ABCB1 3435TT genotype, which was not sig-nificantly different from the rate of TT carriers in the con-trol group (Jaitner et al., 2012). In contrast to the previ-ous, the Genetic Variants in ABCB1, CYP2C19 and Car-diovascular Outcomes Following Treatment with Clopido-grel and Prasugrel study showed that the C3435T genotype was significantly associated with risk of adverse cardio-vascular events. 2932 patients with an acute coronary syn-drome (ACS) in the TRITON-TIMI 38 treated with clopi-dogrel were genotyped. Among the ACS patients, ABCB1 C3435T genotype was significantly associated with risk of the primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke. TT homozygotes showed a 72% increased risk of the pri-mary endpoint as compared with CT/CC individuals when evaluated through 15 months. The rates of stent thrombo-sis did not differ between the TT homozygotes and CT/CC patients (Mega et al., 2010).ConclusionABCB1 C3435T SNP has been associated with an in-creased P-glycoprotein expression, which theoretically should lead to decreased absorption, lower platelet inhi-bition and an increased rate of ischemic event occurrence in patients treated with clopidogrel. However, controver-sy exists regarding whether the C3435T variant influenc-es clopidogrel associated clinical outcomes. The ongoing ABCB1 C3435T genotyping study of patients with coro-nary artery disease is expected to determine the influence of this variant on clopidogrel associated clinical outcome in R.

Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* slavkovski.andrej@gmail.comIntroductionAtorvastatin (ATS) is an important and efficacious member of the statins drug class in treating dyslipidemia and coronary heart disease. It works by inhibiting 3-hy-droxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reduc-tase that reduces hepatocyte cholesterol levels which in turn causes up-regulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and increased clearance of LDL-cholesterol from the plasma. ATS is a poorly water-soluble BCS class II drug, which is highly lipophilic (partition coefficient [log P (octanol/water)] of 6.36) in nature (Oliveira et al., 2013). Its low oral bioavailability (~12%) is attributed to its poor aqueous solubility, pre-systemic metabolism in GI mucosa and efflux by P-gp (Khan et al., 2016). To overcome these problems, various solubilization strategies have been proposed in the literature (Ali et al., 2013). One such more successful technique is formulation of spontaneous or self-emulsifying drug delivery system. Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems have been catego-rized as, self-microemulsifying (SMEDDS) and self-nano-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) depending upon the droplet size produced after dispersion. The SMEDDS are preconcentrates of microemulsion, which form a microemulsion upon contacting water. These are anhydrous homogeneous mixtures of oil, surfactant and/or cosurfactant, and drug which when come in contact with aqueous medium (GI fluids) form a o/w (oil-in-wa-ter) microemulsion with little agitation (provided by peri-staltic movement of GIT). This spontaneous formation of a fine emulsion in the GIT presents the drug in a solubilized form, and the small droplet size provides a large interfa-cial surface area for drug absorption (Kishore et al., 2015).In light of above said facts, the aim of the present study was to establish the solubility of ATS in aqueous systems using self-microemulsification technique. ATS containing SMEDDS were developed using olive oil as oil phase, PEG 400 as surfactant and Tween 20 as co-surfactant screened from the solubility studies. Mixture simplex lattice design was applied for determination of the optimal formulation where mean droplet size, size distribution and optical clar-ity were followed as responses. Materials and methodsMaterialsOlive oil was supplied from Fluka Analytical, Spain. Tween 20 (polysorbate 20) was purchased from Merck, Germany. PEG 400 (polyethylene glycol 400) was ob-tained from Merck, Germany. Atorvastatin calcium (ATS; Form VII, D50 1.4 um) was kindly donated by Alkaloid, Macedonia. All the other chemicals and reagents were of the highest purity grade commercially available and used as received. Solubility studiesThe solubility determination of ATS in various liquid lipids (olive oil, mineral oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, oleic acid, castor oil), surfactants (Tween 20, Tween 60, Tween 80, Span 20, Span 80) and co-surfactants (PEG 200, PEG 400, propylene glycol, ethanol, isopropanol) was per-formed by the test tube method. Excess ATS (250 mg) was added into 1 g of each vehicle followed by vortex mixing for 30 s. Mixtures were equilibrated for 72 h at 37 degC on a controlled shaker water bath (Haake SWB 20, Germa-ny). Afterwards, mixtures were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 45 min; Tehtnica, Centric 322B, Slovenia). Solubility of ATS in different vehicles was determined visually. Only sam-648Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 647 - 648 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessionples where ATS was completely dissolved were used for preparation of SMEDDS. The experiments were conduct-ed in triplicate.Preparation of SMEDDSBased on the results obtained from solubility stud-ies, olive oil, Tween 20 and PEG 400 were selected for preparation of ATS-SMEDDS (ATS 20 mg). Mixture sim-plex lattice design (Design-Expert V8 trial, Stat-Ease, Inc., Minneapolis, USA) was applied for determination of their optimal quantities. Mixture components in total of 100% (Smix = 0.5 g) were varied. Low and high levels of studied variables were: variable A, olive oil - 10 and 50%; variable B, Tween 20 - 10 and 50% and variable C, PEG 400 - 40 and 80%. A total of 13 experiments were carried out. Mean droplet size, size distribution and optical clarity were fol-lowed as responses. Optimization was carried out in terms of minimal values of followed responses. In brief, designed Smix`s with ATS were prepared in test tubes and stirred for 24 h (200 rpm, 37 degC; Variomag, USA). Afterwards, the prepared mixtures were added into 300 mL of 0.1 M HCl in a glass beakers maintained at 37 degC and stirred at 300 rpm until a transparent solution was formed.Characterization of SMEDDSMean droplet size (D50) and size distribution (ex-pressed as SPAN factor value) of the obtained SMEDDS were assessed by laser diffractometry using Mastersizer 2000, Hydro 2000S, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK.Samples of freshly prepared SMEDD formulations were investigated for optical clarity spectrophotometri-cally (400 nm; UV/vis spectrophotometer, Perkin Elmer, Lambda 16, USA). The lower absorbance indicated higher optical clarity of the systems. The ATS content present in prepared formulations was assessed by dissolving 1ml of the liquid SMEDD formu-lation in methanol. After suitable dilutions with methanol, drug content was assayed at 246 nm (UV/vis spectropho-tometer, Perkin Elmer, Lambda 16, USA).Results and discussionSolubility studies were carried out in order to identify the suitable vehicles for the formulation of SMEDDS. Ol-ive oil, Tween 20 and PEG 400 were selected as oil phase, surfactant and co-surfactant based on their highest solubil-ity towards ATS.Results from experimental design studies pointed that D50 was in range of 0.61 um to 1.212 um and SPAN factor from 1.072 to 2.958, with unimodal particle size distribu-tion. The absorbance related to optical clarity of the pre-pared formulations was in range of 0.119 to 0.455.A special cubic model for D50 and reduced cubic mod-el for SPAN factor and optical clarity was applied. Math-ematical models for influence of selected variables upon followed responses were created and significant variables were identified. Variables BC, AC, AB and ABC were sig-nificant for D50. For SPAN factor value and optical clarity, variables BC, AC, AB and AC*(A-C) and BC*(B-C) and AC*(A-C) were significant factors, respectively.Results from experimental design studies were used for determination of optimal formulation; sample prepared with 15.44% olive oil, 19.48% Tween 20 and 65.08% PEG 400 with predicted responses of 0.78 for D50, 1.14 for SPAN factor and 0.18 for absorbance with the desirabili-ty value of 0.831. Cross validation of the model was car-ried out and satisfactory results for percent of relative er-ror (less than 10%) of the predicted and experimental val-ues were obtained.The ATS content in prepared SMEDDS was found to be in the range of 94-99%. The data inferred good drug-loading with low standard deviation indicating the unifor-mity of drug content. Optimized liquid formulation of ATS was further spray-dried in order to obtain solid SMEDDS.ConclusionLiquid SMEDDS of ATS were composed according to the solubility of drug in mixtures of oil phase, surfactant and co-surfactant systems. Optimal formulation was se-lected based on results from the experimental design stud-ies. Further investigations will be focused on characteriza-tion of solid SMEDDS in order to confirm the potential of the designed system for solving the problem of formulat-ing drugs with low aqueous solubility and poor systemic bioavailability.

Cyril & Methodius" University,Majka Teresa 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* stanojkovskaradmila@yahoo.comIntroductionMultiple emulsions are complex polydispersed sys-tems where both oil in water (o/w) and water in oil (w/o) emulsion exists simultaneously in a single system, stabi-lized by lipophillic and hydrophilic surfactants, respective-ly. The ratio of these surfactants is critical factor for achiev-ing stable vesicular system (Kumar et al., 2012). Multiple emulsions have been formulated for controlled/sustained or targeted drug delivery, taste masking, enzyme immobili-zation, as well as cosmetic vehicles for skin care products. Water/oil/water (w/o/w) multiple emulsions consist of dispersed oil globules containing smaller aqueous droplets; each inner aqueous droplet is separated from the outer aque-ous phase by an oil phase layer which acts as a liquid mem-brane. Therefore, w/o/w multiple emulsions have many advantages over conventional emulsions such as: relative-ly high entrapment capacity for water-soluble agents, pro-tection of substances that may undergo degradation, abil-ity to introduce incompatible substances in two aqueous compartments of the same system and prolonged release rate of incorporated active agent (Mahmood and Akhtar, 2013). The release properties and stability of w/o/w mul-tiple emulsions are influenced by different factors, such as surfactants type and concentration, method of preparation, and some physical properties of the designed vesicular sys-tem (globule size, viscosity, conductivity, phase volume ra-tio, etc) (Vasiljevic et al., 2009).In our preliminary studies, different factors (surfac-tants concentration, phase volume ratio, preparation pro-cedure) were investigated, and optimized formulation and process parameters were selected for further development of w/o/w multiple emulsion system suitable for topical de-livery of resveratrol (RSV). RSV, an antioxidant polyphe-nol from red wine, has been the subject of intense interest in recent years due to a range of unique anti-aging proper-ties (Baxter, 2008).
