Pharmacol. 9:409.doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00409An Ethnobotanical Study ofMedicinal Plants in the Greek Islandsof North Aegean RegionEvangelos Axiotis, Maria Halabalaki* and Leandros A. SkaltsounisDepartment of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian Universityof Athens, Athens, GreeceGreek islands of the North Aegean Region are a group of nine inhabited islands (Lemnos,Agios Efstratios, Lesvos, Chios, Psara, Oinousses, Samos, Ikaria, and Fourni) located inthe northern part of the Aegean Sea, close to Asia Minor. Each island of this regioncan be considered autonomous in terms of culture and biodiversity. With this workwe try to evaluate the status of the traditional uses of medicinal plants in this region.Endemic and endangered species such as Sideritis sipylea Boiss., Origanum sipyleumL., Thymus sipyleus Boiss., Pistacia lentiscus L., Verbascum ikaricum Murb., are stillused by locals to treat different ailments. Moreover, the use of some species for thetreatment of specific diseases has been reported for the first time. We report about 109wild plants of medicinal importance, from 52 families, listing their uses for therapeuticpurposes and galenic preparations provided by local medical doctors and pharmacists.The information we include was derived from literature sources and additionally collectedthrough semi-structured interviews conducted on 200 informants (100 men and 100women). Additionally, informant consensus factor (FIC) and UV value were calculatedfor the medicinal plants in the current study in relation with the diseases treated. Thisresearch confirms the importance of the medicinal plants and the diffusion of theiruse in traditional medicine within this region. This ethnopharmacological survey is afundamental step for the preservation of the local knowledge both for further scientificresearch and for the protection of endangered and endemic medicinal plants.Keywords: ethnopharmacology, traditional medicine, Near East Greek islands, North Aegean Sea, ethnobotanyINTRODUCTIONGreece holds a unique position with respect to the number of plant species and subspeciescompared to other areas of the globe. This depends on the variety of habitats, as well as ongeological history, climate conditions, and geographical position within the Mediterranean. Thus,it is noted for its high plant species diversity (5800 species and 1893 subspecies) and endemism(22.2% of all species present with 1278 species and 452 subspecies) (Davis, 1965-1986; Tutin et al.,1968-1980; Strid, 1986; Strid and Tan, 1991, 1997, 2002; Georgiou and Delipetrou, 2010).The Northeast Aegean islands offer a unique ecosystem with significant "hotspots" for variousplant diversification responses and endemism. This depends on the fact that Aegean Sea isan archipelago of continental islands placed on the conjunction of Europe, Asia, and Africa(Gogou et al., 2016). The available "ecological space" with "environmental heterogeneity" inaddition with the "land-bridge system" with the continents determined a high floristic diversityFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 40999fphar-09-00409 May 19, 2018 Time: 14:41 # 2Axiotis et al. Ethnobotanical Study of North Aegeanand endemism (Kallimanis et al., 2011). Several botanical studieshave been conducted on these islands (Christodoulakis, 1986,1996; Panitsa et al., 1994, 2006; Panitsa and Tzanoudakis,1998, 2001; Snogerup et al., 2001; Bazos, 2005). However,there is limited information regarding the medicinal plants andtraditional plant remedies in this area.Nowadays the use of plants and traditional medicine playsan important role for the discovery of new pharmacologicalagents. Ethnopharmacology represents a multidimensionalapproach, shaped by tradition and science that can improveour knowledge of plant use and local meaning of health anddisease (World Health Organization [WHO], 2002). The aimof this study is threefold: to present a complete list of themedicinal plants used in traditional medicine in the islandsof Northeast Aegean Sea, preserve information about theiruse and, lastly, highlight the use in traditional medicine ofendemic and endangered plant species, in order to prevent theirextinction.MATERIALS AND METHODSStudy AreaThe current study was conducted on the islands and isletsof the northeast edge of the Aegean Sea and is dominatedby the islands of Lemnos, Agios Efstratios, Lesvos, Chios,Psara, Oinousses, Samos, Ikaria, and Fournoi (Figure 1). Thegeographical coordinates of the islands are represented inSupplementary Table 4. The region covers an area of 3835 km2and has approximately 2500 vascular plant species.The terrain of the islands is 33% mountainous, 35% hilly,and 32% flat. The surface area and the maximum elevationranged from 40 km2 for Psara and Fourni to 1633 km2for Lesvos and from 0 to 1433 m of height (Kerketea mt,Samos), respectively (Higgins and Higgins, 1996). The islandscan be grouped in two phytogeographical zones among the13 existing in Greece (Supplementary Figure 1); the zone ofthe Northern Aegean (NAe) with Lemnos and Agios Efstratiosand the zone of the Eastern Aegean (EAe) with Lesvos, Psara,Chios, Oinousses, Samos, Ikaria and Fournoi, with specificclimatic differences (Rauh, 1949). The palaeography and thegeological events that separated these islands from Anatolianmainland, certain environmental parameters (temperature andhumidity) and habitat diversity in well-defined fragmented areas,are among the causes of the high endemism, floral richnessand diversification in quantity and quality of many secondarymetabolites that characterize the pharmacological properties ofmany species of the study area (Panitsa et al., 2010).MethodologyThe information summarized in the present paper was compiledfrom 15 randomly selected villages from the islands of thesurveyed area (Figure 1). The methodology followed in thefield surveys is based on Fujita et al. (1995). The data wascollected through semi-structured interviews performed withlocal people (Martin, 1995). After explaining the purpose ofour research, a questionnaire in Greek was administered tothe informants including questions about their age, education,and interest in traditional medicine. A total of 200 peoplewas surveyed, 100 women and 100 men, with an average ageof 40. The informants with knowledge about medicinal plantswere questioned multiple times, and, during the interviews,local names of the plants, utilized parts, preparation methodsand traditional cultivation techniques were recorded. Themajority of these skillful informants were medical doctors,pharmacists, and farmers. All the results are summarized inSupplementary Table 1. The data acquired for each plant includesfamily, botanical name, local name in Greek, locality, vouchernumber, parts used and their preparation, therapeutic effect andailments treated. The plant families were listed in alphabeticalorder.Field trips were conducted with the interviewees to collectspecimens of the plants (with the exception of the endangeredones). A photographic archive of the observed species was createdto help the identification. The specimens were collected andherborized by the department's herbarium with a specific vouchernumber. Furthermore, we examined the therapeutic effect andpreparations of each plant based on the informants' feedback andon literature records.For the analysis of the use of the medicinal plants againstspecific diseases, we used informant consensus factor (FIC),summarized in Supplementary Table 3 (Trotter and Logan,1986; Heinrich, 2000). Moreover, the Use Value (UV) wascalculated to demonstrate the relative importance of the speciesknown locally, summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The plantspecies scientific names were verified according to the Plant Listand to the International Plant Name Index. Information thatwas not possible to confirm was not recorded.
