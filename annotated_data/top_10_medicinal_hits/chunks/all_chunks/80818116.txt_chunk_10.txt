In the EU, a similar exemption from a patent infringement exists in terms of Article 10(6) of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, as amended in 2004 (Barnden, 2008; De Stasio and McClay, 2004), although its scope is under dispute (Cohen and Peirson, 2013).Results and discussionThe public health argument considers the "Bolar clause" in terms of the right of access to drugs (Van Puymbroeck, 2010). One should, on the other hand, bear in mind the scope of the "Bolar clause" and its scope and possible limitations are dependent on national law. For example, the Court of Justice of the European Union is yet to reach a decision in case C-661/13 Astellas Pharma Inc. v Polpharma SA Pharmaceutical Works on whether EU law considers the research exemptions also in terms of acts by which a third party for purely commercial reasons offers or supplies to a manufacturer of generic medicinal products a patent-protected active substance which that generic pharmaceutical undertaking has planned to use for conducting studies or trials for a marketing authorization under medicinal product law (Ostrowska and Minde, 2014; Straus, 2014). Also, in a dispute before the WTO it was previously found that one may undertake acts generally reserved for the patent holder in terms of obtaining approval for placing on the market of drugs but one cannot undertake activities of stockpiling patented goods during a certain period before the patent expires (Canada - Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical Products, WT/DS 114/R, March 17, 2000).ConclusionA "Bolar clause"-like exception to patent infringement, as regulated by the IPL, can therefore be deemed as generally consistent with the TRIPS. On the other hand, one may also find that the wording of Article 91(2) of the IPL is broader than EU law, while also taking into account the ambiguities of the latter. The IPL, in those terms, seems to be enacted in the spirit of the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act as it expressly covers the acts of manufacture, offer for sale, export or import. Here one may even dispute the alignment with the TRIPS. Although this may prove to be inadequate when legal rules are concerned, the Macedonian pharmaceutical market will probably not be largely affected by it. Truth be told, the mainstream pharmaceutical sector will function notwithstanding the provisions of the IPL. In any case, intentionally or not, the wording of the "Bolar clause"-like exception of the IPL may be treated as an argument for the need of a clarified and more developed EU range rule, as the Republic of Macedonia is a candidate country for membership in the Union.ReferencesAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, 1994.World Trade Organization.Barnden, M., 2008.

Goce Delcev 9b, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* gkoevski@gmail.comIntroductionAs from beginning of 2012 a legal frame for parallel trade (imports) of medicines was introduced in the Repub-lic of Macedonia. Since this regulatory reform raised a lot of practical dilemmas our aim is to clarify some of them. Parallel imports are legitimate goods that are placed into circulation in one market and then imported into a second market without the authorization of the patent holder, but, at the same time, allow existence of competition for a drug which is still under patent protection (Religioni and Czerw, 2012). They are neither generic versions of a brand name drug, nor are pirated copies that form part of the "black market" (Brougher, 2014). They have the same active in-gredient, in the same amount and the same dosage form as the locally sourced drugs. The driving force for parallel trade is the price differ-ence between the source (exporting) and the destination (importing) country. This kind of arbitrage has been for de-cades legally practiced in the Europe Union (EU) under the common norms of the primary EU law, in particular Euro-pean competition law on free movement of goods (Articles 34, 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Eu-ropean Union - TFEU) and represent instrument for creat-ing competition for any medicine during its patent life (Mi-yase, 2011). Parallel trade in the European pharmaceutical sector is widespread. In its 2009 Final Report following its inqui-ry into the pharmaceuticals sector, the European Commis-sion (EC) noted that the turnover of parallel traders was be-tween EUR 3.5 billion and EUR 5 billion in Europe, that is, between 2% and 3% of the overall market (EC report, 2009). Drugs facing competition from parallel imports are found to have on average 17% to 21% lower prices than they would have had if they had never faced such competi-tion (Granlund and Miyase, 2011). There is a vast body of case law regarding competition law issues in parallel trade of medicines: The Istituto Chemioterapico Italiano S.p.A. and Commercial Solvents Corporation v Commission of the EC; The Bayer AG v Commission of the EC; Glaxo-SmithKline Services Unlimited v Commission of the EC; Syfait and others v GlaxoSmithKline; AstraZeneca v Com-mission of the EC; Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG v Com-mission of the EC; etc. (Jones and Sufrin, 2008).Parallel imports, nevertheless, might differ from local-ly-sourced drugs in color, taste or shape. Due to the dif-ferences in country-specific labelling requirements or stan-dard package sizes, parallel imports might thus be repack-aged or relabeled. The ECJ has also issued decisions re-lated to this issue: Bristol-Myers Squibb; Upjohn; Mer-ck Case; Boehringer Ingelheim I and II Cases. Two recent cases on the repackaging of pharmaceutical goods by par-allel importers reconsidered the exhaustion of rights prin-ciple in the context of free movement of pharmaceuticals: the Welcome Foundation Ltd v Paranova Pharmazeutika Handels GmbHand Orifarm and Paranova v Merck Sharp and Dohme (Armengod and Baudenbacher, 2009). Parallel imports are inevitably related to the pharmaceutical indus-try which itself is subject to rigorous patent system (Fol-land et al., 2013). Although territorial by nature, patent law is faced with the challenge of protecting and managing patent rights worldwide. Those rights are governed by two main or-ganizations: the World International Patent Organization (WIPO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). One of the agreements that countries must ratify upon joining the WTO is the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intel-lectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Parallel imports are al-lowed under Article 6 of the TRIPS Agreement (Brough-er, 2014). The legality of parallel imports steams from the S1 PP 2158Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 57 - 58 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsterritorial exhaustion of intellectual property rights (IPRs). Regional exhaustion applies in the EU, meaning that IPRs are exhausted upon first sale anywhere in the EU (Gran-lund and Miyase, 2011). On EU level there is continuous struggle between different associations representing inter-ests of various stakeholders. The European Association of Euro-Pharmaceuti-cal Companies (EAEPC) as professional and representa-tive voice of pharmaceutical parallel distribution in Eu-rope should be mentioned first. Its position is that the de-spite the specifics of the pharmaceutical market, parallel distribution of pharmaceuticals is a legitimate commer-cial practice and consistent with the goals of the EU sin-gle market (EAEPC, 2016). On the other hand, the Euro-pean Alliance for Access to Safe Medicines (EAASM) rep-resents the stance that the main academic and policy ar-guments should not be only driven by the economics of parallel imports, but rather many other issues of equal im-portance should be considered as well (EAASM, 2014). Hence, pharmaceutical companies should be permitted to implement practices responding to parallel trade as long as these measures are not contrary to the EU competition rules (Forrester and Dawes, 2008). For example, parallel imports may cause negative effects such as: drug shortage in the exporting countries; the drug quality may be dam-aged due to the transportation, inappropriate storage or re-packing; disruption of already established producer - ex-clusive distributor relations on a particular market; cuts in research and development investments and negative ef-fects in launching new medicines (Monti, 2007; Religio-ni and Czerw, 2012); consumers might consider parallel imports to be imperfect substitutes for the locally-sourced drugs, increased risks relating to the entry of counterfeit medicines into the legitimate supply chain, etc. (Hawkins, 2011). Thus, practices for gaining exclusivity extensions by pharmaceutical companies should be justified. Those practices are: non-patent exclusivities, combining two or more successful drugs into one tablet and marketing it as a new product, continuation application practice, strategic patenting, etc. (Brougher, 2014; Gupta et al., 2010). The case of the Republic of MacedoniaAs mentioned before the concept of parallel imports in Macedonia was introduced in 2012 by amending the 2007 Law on Drugs and Medical Devices. The parallel trade is not defined by the 2010 Law on Protection of Competi-tion. However, Macedonian competition legislation is ful-ly in line with the EU one, meaning that EU practices are fully effective in national context. Macedonia is member of WTO since April 2003. Up to December 2015, 186 ap-provals have been issued for parallel imports by the Drug Agency in Macedonia. Turkey emerges as an exclusive ex-porting country in all imports. Four drug wholesalers are engaged in parallel imports (MALMED, 2016). However, there is still no significant official evaluation as regards the economic effects of these imports on the Macedonian phar-maceutical market.ReferencesArmengod, H. and Baudenbacher, L.M., 2009.

Quality of life (QoL) has become a part of the evaluation criteria for can-cer therapy besides the classical biomedical criteria. It is the most frequently used outcome measures in oncology research (Lee et al., 2000). In Kosovo there is very little in-formation available about the QoL of cancer patients.The European Organization for Research and Treat-ment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a questionnaire to assess the quality of life in cancer patients. The QLQ-C30 questionnaire has been used worldwide (Aaronson et al., 1993). The Albanian QLQ-C30 version has been translated by EORTC, and to our knowledge this is the first evaluation of the question-naire.
