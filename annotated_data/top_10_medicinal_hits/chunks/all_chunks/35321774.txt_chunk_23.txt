Department of Druganalysis, Vojvode Stepe 450, 11 152 Belgrade, Serbia2University of Belgrade, Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy, Depart-ment of Analytical Chemistry, Karnegijeva 4, 11 000 Belgrade, SerbiaINTRODUCTIONInherent chemical stability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient(API) largely determines the stability of the final drug product (DP), andregulatory authorities require novel chemical entities to undergo ex-tensive chemical stability evaluation through stress testing (1,2).Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an immunosuppressive agent, whichis mostly used in solid organ transplant patients to prevent organ re-jection. MMF is pro drug that is rapidly absorbed and hydrolyzed toform free Mycophenolate mofetil (MPA), the active metabolite, whichis considered as impurity in the final DP (3).OBJECTIVESThe main objectives of this investigation were determination of theinfluence of oxidative stress agent on MMF stability and identificationof unknown key-degradation products, if any.MATERIALS AND METHODSMMF was purchased from Sigma. HPLC analysis was performed with anAgilent Technologies (Palo Alto, CA, USA) HP 1200 chromatographequipped with on-line degasser, binary pump, column oven, diode arraydetector, and Rheodyne 20-mL loop injector. Data was acquired bymeans of HP ChemStation software. Before HPLC performing,all mobile phases were degassed and vacuum filtered through 0.45 mmnylon membranes. The chromatographic conditions included Chro-molith RP-18e (100 mm x 4.6 mm, macropore size 2 mm, mesopore size13 nm) column, flow rate of the mobile phase of 1 mL min-1, the cho-sen temperature of the column of 40degC and composition of the mobilephase of acetonitrile - 0.015 M ammonium acetate (pH 4.4) (28:72, v/v).The pH of the water phase was adjusted to 4.4 with glacial acetic acid,and oxidation product was analyzed in the positive ionization (PI)mode, though MPA was detected in the negative ionization (NI) modewith the proposed mobile phase. The mass spectrometer operated infull scan mode and for all the experiments spray needle voltage was setat 4.5 kV. Nitrogen was used as a sheath and auxiliary gas, and values(a scale of arbitrary units in the 0-100 range defined by the LCQ Ad-vantage system) of their flow rate were 50 and 0, respectively. The cap-illary temperature was maintained at 290 oC and Helium was used asthe collision gas.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe influence of 3%, 10% and 15% H2O2, as oxidation agent, on MMFwas investigated in duration of 1h. Adding 10% H2O2 resulted in degra-dation of 17.90% of drug amount and MPA, first (DP I) and second ox-idation products (DP II) were formed.The importance of all degradation products was estimated consider-ing key-degradants rule (4). Therefore, the main degradation productwas DP II with 41.67% of total degradation followed by MPA with14.32% of total degradation and 34% of the largest degradant. On theother side, DP I appeared in 3% of total degradation and 7.09% of thelargest degradant. Considering these results DP II and MPA could benoted as key-degradants, whereas DP I is not significant. In order toidentify key-degradant denoted as DP II LC-MSn nalysis was performed. In full scan mode were observed positive ions m/z 434 correspondingto MMF, m/z 336 corresponding to DP I, m/z 450 corresponding to DPII and negative ion m/z 319 corresponding to MPA. Along with m/z 450adduct ions [M+Na]+ (m/z 472) and [M+K]+ (m/z 488) have been formed.DP II has m/z 450 and is 16 units higher than m/z 434 of MMF,indicating oxidation of MMF and arisen of its N-oxide. To confirm theidentity of DP II the MSn analysis of all analytes has been conducted.The MSn analysis was performed by infusing sample subjected to 15%H2O2 directly to the mass spectrometer, with the syringe pump at the5 ml min-1. Obtained fragments for mycophenolate mofetil,mycophenolic acid and DP II, all in positive ionization mode, togetherwith their relative abundances confirmed the structure of DP II. Theidentical fragmentation pattern for both MMF and DP II stronglyindicates the same main structure of these compounds.CONCLUSIONMycophenolate mofetil showed to be instable towards oxidationagents and tree degradation products have been formed. LC-MSnanalysis was used to resolve the structure of key-oxidation product N-oxide of MMF.REFERENCES1.

Poposka, M. Shishovska, K. Starkoska, Z. Arsova-SarafinovskaInstitute for Public Health of the Republic of Macedonia, 50 Divizija 6,1000 Skopje, Republic of MacedoniaINTRODUCTIONSildenafil is oral drug used primarily to treat male sexual functionproblems (impotence or erectile dysfunction) since becoming avail-able in 1998. It is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specificphosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, wherePDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP. Sildenafil has a peri-pheral site of action on erections. This substance has no direct re-laxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potentlyenhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue. However, there is no analytical method for determination of this ac-tive compound in pharmaceutical preparations in the current Euro-pean and US Pharmacopoeia. The aim of this study was to develop and validate HPLC method for sil-denafil analysis in pharmaceutical dosage forms.MATERIALS AND METHODSHPLC analysis was performed using a Schimadzu LC-2010chromatographic system (Schimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of a LC-20AT Prominence liquid chromatograph pump with DGU-20A5Prominence degasser, a SPD-M20A Prominence Diode Array Detector,RF 10AXI fluorescence detector and a SIL-20 AC Prominence autosampler. Data analyses were done using Class VP 7.3 Software. Theelution was carried out on a column Hypersil BDS-C18 (125 x 4 mmi.d., 5 mm), mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH2.8)-acetonitrile (71:29, V/V), flow rate 1.5 mL min-1, at controlled tem-perature (25oC) and autosamler temperature at 4oC. Detection of silde-nafil was carried out at 285 nm. Commercially available, film-coatedtablets, containing 50 mg sildenafil as sildenafil citrate, were used inthis study. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe method was fully validated according to the ICH (InternationalConference on Harmonization) guidelines by determination of linear-ity, precision, accuracy, limit of detection and limit of quantification. Linearity of the method was tested in the range of: 2 - 100 mg mL-1sildenafil (Fig. 1). Experimental data showed high level of linearitywhich was proved with the value for the correlation coefficient (R2 =0.9994).Limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the method weretested in the range of: 20 - 200 ng mL-1 sildenafil. The results were:0.23 ng and 0.68 ng for LOD and LOQ, respectively (9.2 ng mL-1 and27.2 ng mL-1 for LOD and LOQ, respectively, obtained with 25 mL in-jected).Selectivity of the method was proved with the chromatographic peakresolution obtained between sildenafil and tadalafil (Rs = 10, 5) (Fig. 2) and the characteristic UV-spectrum.Fig. 1.

Furthermore, this procedure isrelatively inexpensive and simple and is particularly suitable for routineanalyses when tandem mass spectrometric detection is not available.Additionally, it is important to mention that decreased consumptionof organic solvent considerably reduces the laboratory expenses.REFERENCES1.
