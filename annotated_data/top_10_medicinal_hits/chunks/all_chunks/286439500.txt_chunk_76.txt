However, in anin vitro study an aqueous extract of C. nobile was demonstratedto induce a vasorelaxant effect through the NO-cGMP pathway orpossibly through a combination of Ca2+ channel inhibition plusNO-modulating and phosphodiesterase inhibitory mechanisms.After the oral administration of RC aqueous extract, significanthypotensive effect was observed in an animal study onspontaneously hypertensive rats (Zeggwagh et al., 2009), whichmay be related to the flavonoid content of the plant (Jouad et al.,2001). The clinical efficacy of orally applied preparations has notbeen studied yet, only the effects of external application (Schraderet al., 1997) and aromatherapeutic use (Wilkinson et al., 1999)have been reported.The aim of the current study was to assess the effects ofa hydroethanolic RC extract, its fractions and essential oilon gastrointestinal and urogenital smooth muscles, includingpreparations of human jejunum, in order to clarify the rationalefor the use of this plant for smooth muscle relaxation.Experiments were carried out with an extract conforming to themonograph of the European Medicines Agency (see in section"Preparation of Herbal Extracts and Isolation of ReferenceStandards"), and also with the fractions of this extract and withthe essential oil of the plant.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant MaterialRoman chamomile flowers were purchased from Pal Bobvos(Hungary). The identity of the plant material was confirmedaccording to the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia.A voucher specimen is stored for verification purposes in theherbarium of the Department of Pharmacognosy, Universityof Szeged. RC essential oil was purchased from Aromax Ltd.(Hungary).ChemicalsFor the pharmacological experiments the following drugs wereused: atropine sulfate (Sigma), a,b-methylene ATP lithiumsalt (Tocris), capsaicin, histamine dihydrochloride, indo-methacin, isoprenaline hydrochloride, NG-nitro-L-arginine,papaverine hydrochloride, prostaglandin F2a (Sigma),methysergide (Sandoz), (+-)-propranolol hydrochloride(Sigma), pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acidtetrasodium salt (PPADS), tetrodotoxin (Tocris), 8-amino-7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxan-5-carboxylic acid,1'-butyl-4'-piperidinylmethyl ester (SB204070), N-(1-azabicycloFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 323194fphar-09-00323 April 4, 2018 Time: 18:30 # 3Sandor et al. Spasmolytic Effect of Roman Chamomile[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-6-chloro-4-methyl-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine-8-carboxamide hydrochloride (Y25130) (all fromTocris). For dissolving and diluting of these drugs the followingsolvents were used: 96% ethanol for capsaicin, indomethacin,and prostaglandin F2a, DMSO for SB204070 and isotonic NaClsolution for the rest of the drugs. Solutions in organic solventswere administered at a maximum of 1 ul/ml, aqueous solutionsat 1 or 3 ul/ml bathing solution.Millipore Direct-Q UV3 clarifier (Molsheim, France) was usedto produce purified water for the HPLC measurements. Methanoland ethanol (LiChrosolv R(c) HPLC grade) was obtained fromMerck (Darmstadt, Germany). For chromatographic separation,polyamide (ICN Polyamide for Column Chromatography),Sephadex LH-20 (25-100 um, Pharmacia Fine Chemicals), SiO2(Silica gel 60 G, 15 um, Merck), and SiO2 plates (20 cm x 20 cmSilica gel 60 F254, Merck) were used.Preparation of Herbal Extracts andIsolation of Reference StandardsFor the pharmacological experiments, RC crude extract wasprepared according to the description of the European MedicinesAgency monograph (EMA-HMPC, 2012). Ten grams of plantmaterial was extracted with 70% EtOH (3x 100 ml) via ultrasonicbath, evaporated in vacuum and lyophilized (yield, 3.169%). Partof the RC crude extract was fractionated to gain RC extractfractions with different compositions for further experiments.Vacuum liquid chromatography on polyamide with elution byMeOH-H2O (20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:20, 100:0) was used to gainfractions from the crude extract as follows: F20, F40, F60, F80,and F100.From the methanolic extract of 200 g RC flowers, four markercompounds (used as reference standards in further experiments)were isolated using medium pressure liquid chromatography(SiO2 as stationary phase), gel chromatography (SephadexLH-20), preparative HPLC (RP), and preparative TLC (SiO2).The purity and identity of these compounds were analyzedby NMR. NMR spectra were recorded in MeOD on a BrukerAvance DRX 500 spectrometer (Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland)at 500 MHz (1H) or 125 MHz (13C).HPLC ExperimentsHPLC experiments were carried out on a Shimadzu LC-20ADLiquid Chromatograph (SPD-M20A diode array detector,CBM-20A controller, SIL-20ACHT autosampler, DGU-20A5Rdegasser unit, CTO-20AC column oven) using a Kinetex 5 umC-18 100A (150 mm x 4.6 mm) with a gradient of 0,01%trifluoroacetic acid in H2O (A) and acetonitrile (B) as follows:0-5 min 25% B, 14 min 28% B, 15 min 70% B, 16 min70% B, 16.5 min 25% B, and 20 min 25% B. The flow was1.2 ml/min, column oven temperature was 55*C. Detection wascarried out within the range of 190-800 nm. For quantification,chromatograms were integrated at 344 nm. The referencestandards and the evaporated extracts were dissolved in MeOH,filtered through a PTFE syringe filter and injected in volumes of5 or 10 ul. Calibration curves were established for all the fourreference standards.GC and GC-MS ExperimentsThe GC analysis was carried out with an HP 5890 Series II gaschromatograph (FID), using a 30 m x 0.35 mm x 0.25 umHP-5 fused silica capillary column. The temperature programranged from 60*C to 210*C at 3*C min-1, and from 210*C to250*C (2 min hold) at 5*C min-1. The detector and injectortemperature was set to 250*C and the carrier gas was N2,with split sample introduction. Quantities of the individualcomponents of the essential oil were expressed as the percent ofthe peak area relative to the total peak area from the GC/FIDanalysis.The GC-MS analysis was performed with a Finninan GCQion trap bench-top mass spectrometer. All conditions wereas above except that the carrier gas was He at a linearvelocity of 31.9 cm s-1 and the capillary column was DB-5MS(30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 um). The positive ion electronionization mode was used, with ionization energy of 70 eV, andthe mass range of 40-400 amu.Identification of the compounds was based on comparisonswith published MS data (Adams, 2007) and with a computerlibrary search (the database was delivered together with theinstrument) and also by comparing their retention indiceswith literature values (Adams, 2007). Retention indices werecalculated against C8-C32 n-alkanes on a CB-5 MS column(Kovats, 1965). A mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons was injectedin hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) by usingthe same temperature program that was used for analyzing theessential oil.Guinea Pig and Rat PreparationsGuinea pigs (short-haired, colored, 350-450 g) or Wistar rats(220-300 g) of either sex were killed by a blow to the head andexsanguination. Three centimeter segments of the ileum or distalcolon were placed into the organ bath in a vertical position, undera constant tension of 7 mN. Longitudinal strip preparations(approximately 2-3 cm in length) of guinea pig urinary bladderor rat gastric fundus were fixed under a tension of 5 mN.This study was carried out in accordance with Universityguidelines. The protocol was approved by the Animal WelfareCommittee, University of Pecs (registration number, BA02/2000-1/2012) with the understanding that isolated organ studies afterstunning the animal cannot be regarded as animal experiments.Organ Bath ExperimentsSmooth muscle preparations were used in a traditional organbath arrangement. The preparations were suspended in Krebs-Henseleit solution of 5 or 7 ml, kept at 37*C, and aerated witha mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. The solution contained119 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.5 mMMgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, and 11 mM glucose(pH = 7.4). Movements of the preparations were recorded withisotonic transducers (Hugo Sachs Elektronik-Harvard Apparatus,March, Germany) on ink writers or stored online on a personalcomputer.The guinea pig ileum is a preparation of a low spontaneoustone.

Spasmolytic Effect of Roman Chamomileits fractions, essential oil, or flavonoids were studied at basaltone. All experiments commenced with determining the maximallongitudinal spasm by adding histamine (10 uM) to the organbath for 2 min. This response served as reference for determiningthe relative amplitude of any contractile effect that the samples tobe tested might have had.In another set of experiments the possible relaxant effect of thematerials was tested. For this reason, a tonic, approximately half-maximal contraction of the ileum was provoked by a moderateconcentration of histamine (0.5 uM, added for 15 min). Inpreliminary experiments, no pretreatment was used. In the bulkof the experiments, however, the muscarinic receptor antagonistatropine, as well as tetrodotoxin, an inhibitor of nerve axonalconduction (blocker of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels) wasadded prior to the histamine administration. This was done toavoid the interference with a possible contractile effect of thematerial to be examined, i.e., to create a methodologically clearsituation.All experiments commenced after an equilibration periodof 45 min. Relaxant effects were studied on pre-contractedpreparations (see below). Maximal spasm of the tissue was evokedto serve as a basis for the comparisons to evaluate the responsesobtained by our test materials. The materials examined wereadministered in a single concentration (i.e., in a non-cumulativemanner).Human Jejunal PreparationsMacroscopically intact segments of human jejunum, removedduring the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer were used.Strips of either longitudinal or circular orientation were prepared(the mucosa and submucosa were removed) and fixed asdescribed above, under a tension of 10 mN. Freeze-dried extractsof RC, as well as the essential oil of the plant were mixed in andfurther diluted with DMSO. The amounts of DMSO administeredto the jejunum preparations are indicated in the Section "Results".This study was carried out in accordance with the Declarationof Helsinki and the guidelines set by the Research EthicsCommittee, Scientific Council of the Ministry of Health,Hungary. This Committee agreed to the use of discardedhuman tissue for the experimental work. The protocol wasapproved by the ETT-TUKEB (Scientific Council of the Ministryof Health, Research Ethical Committee) [No. 17861-0/2010-1018EKU (749/PI/10)]. All subjects gave written informedconsent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.Statistical AnalysisResults of the pharmacological experiments are given asmean +- SEM, with N denoting the number of preparationsused for testing efficacy. At most 2 preparations from thesame animal were used for each type of experiment. Resultsare provided in relative values, where 100% contraction meansmaximal spasm of the preparations from the basal tone and, inpre-contracted preparations, 100% relaxation means relaxationof the preparation to the level before adding the precontractingagent. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for the comparisonsof two independent groups, more than two independent sampleswere compared by the Kruskal-Wallis test, and two dependentsamples were compared by the Wilcoxon test. The statisticalprogram GraphPad Prism 5 was used throughout. A probabilityof P < 0.05 or less indicated statistical significance.RESULTSChemical Characterization of RCExtractsIn the HPLC retention time range of 4-9 min, four characteristicpeaks were detected in the crude RC extract and its fractionsF40-F100. The corresponding components were isolated fromthe plant material and were identified as the flavonoidsapigenin, eupafolin, hispidulin, and luteolin by 1H and 13CNMR experiments (see Supplementary Figures S1-S6). Thesecompounds were further used as reference standards tocharacterize the RC extracts. The identification of referencecompounds in different extracts was based on matching theretention times and UV spectra. Retention times of luteolin,eupafolin, apigenin, and hispidulin were 4.5, 5.0, 7.5, and8.5 min, respectively (Figure 1). The baseline separation ofthese compounds allowed their reliable quantification in differentextracts.The crude RC extract contained eupafolin as the mainflavonoid, followed by luteolin, hispidulin, and apigenin(Table 1). The fractionation on polyamide resulted insubfractions F20-F100 with different compositions, asdemonstrated by the differences in their flavonoid content.In F20, the quantities of flavonoids were below the level ofquantification. The flavonoid content of the fractions increasedwith increasing MeOH content of the eluting solvent. Thehighest flavonoid levels were measured in F80, except for luteolinand apigenin, which were mainly concentrated in F100.Chemical Characterization of RCEssential OilBased on their retention times and mass spectrometric data,methallyl angelate, 3-methyl pentyl angelate, and 3-methylamylisobutyrate were identified as the major constituents of RCessential oil (19.0, 18.2, and 10.4%, respectively) (Table 2).The identified components comprised 97% of the essentialoil. Previous articles reported isobutyl angelate as the majorconstituent of RC essential oil (21.6-38.5%), followed by2-methylbutyl angelate (11.6-20.3%) (Antonelli and Fabbri, 1998;Farkas et al., 2003; Omidbaigi et al., 2003, 2004; Bail et al., 2009),and propyl tiglate (10.8-13.1%) (Omidbaigi et al., 2003, 2004)or isobutyl isobutyrate (3.3%) (Bail et al., 2009) or 2-butenylangelate (7.9-8.4%) (Antonelli and Fabbri, 1998) or 2-methyl-2-propenyl angelate (9.1%) (Farkas et al., 2003). However, severalcommercial samples have similar compositions to the sampleanalyzed by us, with methallyl angelate and 3-methyl pentylangelate as the major components.Effects on Guinea Pig IleumThe crude RC extract induced a transient longitudinalcontraction on guinea pig ileum preparations (Figure 2).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 323196fphar-09-00323 April 4, 2018 Time: 18:30 # 5Sandor et al.
