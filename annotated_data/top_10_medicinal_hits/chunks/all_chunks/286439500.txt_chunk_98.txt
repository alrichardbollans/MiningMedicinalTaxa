injections: groups I and II received 1 mL of a 0.9% salinesolution; groups III-V received 5 mL/kg BW of A. laxmanniiethanol extract diluted in distilled water to concentrationsof 25% (25 mg dw/mL), 50% (50 mg dw/mL) and 100%(100 mg dw/mL), respectively; group VI received 20 mg/kg BWdiclofenac (Araniciu et al., 2014).In previous studies on anti-inflammatory activity ofA. bracteosa, the evaluated dose was 200 mg/kg BW (Kayaniet al., 2016), therefore in this research the animals received400 mg/kg BW (100%), 200 mg/kg BW (50%), and 100 mg/kgBW (25%) of A. laxmannii ethanol extract.Twenty-four hours after the incubation of inflammation, therats were anesthetized using a combination of 50 mg/kg BWketamine and 20 mg/kg BW xylazine (Parvu et al., 2014), andblood was withdrawn by retro-orbital puncture. Blood collectedfor use in the phagocytosis test and for white blood cellscount (WBC) was collected on ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA), while blood collected for use in the nitro-oxidative stresstests was collected without anticoagulant. Coagulated blood wascentrifuged and the separated serum was stored in -80*C untiluse. The total nitrites and nitrates (NOx), total oxidative status(TOS), total antioxidant response (TAR) and oxidative stressindex (OSI) calculation was measured in the serum.The experiments were performed in triplicate. At the endof the experiments under anesthesia using a combinationof ketamine (60 mg/kg BW) and xylazine (15 mg/kg BW)(Francischi et al., 2017) animals were killed by cervicaldislocation.In Vitro Phagocytosis TestPhagocytic activity (PA) was determined as previously describedwith minor modifications (Moldovan et al., 2011). The bloodsamples that were harvested on EDTA were incubated with anE. coli suspension (4 x 106 bacteria/mL, in 0.9% saline solutionin the ratio of 0.2 mL of blood/20 uL E. coli suspension) in asilicon tube at 37*C for 30 min. May-Grunwald-Giemsa stainedsmears were then prepared and counted by light microscopyusing an Olympus microscope. We used two parameters toassess phagocytic capacity: the PA which was the number of theE. coli bacteria that were phagocytized by 100 leukocytes, and thephagocytic index (PI) which was the percentage of leukocytes thatphagocytized at least one bacterium.WBC CountFor the WBC count, a blood sample dilution 1:10 in Turksolution was prepared in a Potain leukocyte-dropper. The countwas performed with an optical microscope (Olympus), usinga Burcker-Turk counting chamber. The differential leukocytecount was expressed as a percentage and carried out on May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained smears.Oxidative Stress EvaluationFirst serum samples were passed through 10-kDd filters(Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany) and contaminant proteinswere removed by extraction with a 3:1 (v:v) solution ofmethanol/diethyl ether. The sample methanol/diethyl ether ratiowas 1:9 (v:v) (Harma et al., 2003). The Griess reaction was usedto indirectly determine NO synthesis (NOx). In brief, 100 uL of8 mg/mL VCl3 was added to 100 uL of filtered and extractedserum supernatant in order to reduce nitrate to nitrite, followedby the addition of the Griess reagents, 50 uL of SULF (2%)and 50 uL of NEDD (0.1%). After 30 min incubation at 37*C,the sample absorbance was read at 540 nm. The concentrationof serum NOx was determined using a sodium nitrite-basedcurve, and expressed as nitrite umol/L (Miranda et al., 2001).The TOS of the serum was measured using a colorimetric assay(Erel, 2005). This assay measures the oxidation of ferrous ionsto ferric ions in the presence of various reactive oxygen speciesin an acidic medium. The ferric ions are detected by reactionwith xylenol orange. Assay measurements were standardizedusing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the oxidative species, andthe obtained results were expressed in umol H2O2 equivalents/L.The TAR was measured in serum using a colorimetric assay (Erel,2004). In this assay, the rate of hydroxyl radical producion bythe Fenton reaction was monitored by following the changesin the absorbance of colored dianisidyl radicals. Upon additionof a serum sample, the hydroxyl radical initiated oxidativereactions are suppressed by antioxidant present in the serum.Inhibition of dianisidyl oxidation prevents the subsequent colorchange, thereby effectively measuring the total antioxidantcapacity of the serum. This assay is calibrated using troloxand results are expressed as micromol TE/L. The ratio ofthe TOS to the TAR represents the OSI, an indicator of thedegree of oxidative stress (Harma et al., 2003): OSI (ArbitraryUnit) = TOS (micromol H2O2 equivalents/L)/TAR (micromolTE/L).All of the spectroscopic measurements were performed using aJasco V-530 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Jasco International Co.,Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).Statistical AnalysisAll results were expressed as the mean +- SD. Otherwise,the median and first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3)were reported.

Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniigroups were performed using the Student's t-test (with equal andunequal variances, depending upon to the results of the F-test)for normally distributed data. Mann-Whitney's test was usedfor non-parametric data. Pearson and Spearman's correlationanalyses were used to calculate statistical relationships betweenparameters. A p-value < 0.05 was considered as statisticallysignificant. Analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 forWindows (SPSS Inc., United States).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONQuantitative Determinations of TotalBioactive CompoundsVarious studies showed that phenolic compounds are widelydistributed in the Ajuga species and these compounds couldcontribute to their antioxidant activity. In this part, a preliminarycomparative overview of the total phenolic, flavonoid and iridoidcontents of the different extracts of the A. laxmannii is presented.The TPC is presented in Table 1 and was 67.68 +- 1.57 mgGAE/g dw for ethanol extract, and 56.76 +- 0.92 mg GAE/g dwfor methanol extract. The TPC values of analyzed A. laxmanniiaerial parts extracts were higher than those obtained previouslyfor A. reptans flower extracts (20.86 +- 0.53 and 24.11 +- 0.57 mgGAE/g dw, for methanol and ethanol extracts, respectively) byToiu et al. (2017). Another study performed by Movahhedinet al. (2016) revealed that ethanol extract of Ajuga chamaecistussubsp. scoparia (Boiss.) Rech.f. aerial parts (6.5 g extract obtainedfrom 50 g plant material) had a TPC value of 20.32 +- 0.39 mgGAE/g extract (representing 2.64 mg GAE/g dw), and thewater extract had TPC values of 18.94 +- 0.13 mg GAEs/gextract, which is lower than both previously considered Ajugaspecies.The TFC for ethanol extract of A. laxmannii (36.14+- 0.53 mgRE/g dw), was lower than the one reported for the ethyl acetate,methanol and acetone extract of A. chamaepitys (L.) Schreb(91.76 +- 0.81, 63.87 +- 0.66, and 61.77 +- 0.51 mg RE/g,respectively), and considerably higher than the water extract fromsame species (9.32+- 0.33 mg RE/g) (Jakovljevic', 2015). However,a clear comparison between the results of the present study israther impossible, due to different extraction protocols and waysof expressing results.In previous studies, Toiu et al. (2017) found a TFC value of12.38 +- 0.22 mg RE/g dw for a methanol extract of A. reptansflowers.Concerning the TIC of different species of Ajuga, the availabledata is limited. In a former research on A. reptans flowers, ToiuTABLE 1 | TPC, TFC and TIC in A. laxmannii extracts (+-SD).Extract TPC(mg GAE/g dw)TFC(mg RE/g dw)TIC(mg AE/g dw)Methanol extract (ME) 56.76 +- 0.92 31.22 +- 0.39 15.37 +- 0.77Ethanol extract (EE) 67.68 +- 1.57 36.14 +- 0.53 16.28 +- 0.85Values are the mean +- SD (n = 3).et al. (2017) revealed that the methanol extract content in iridoidsis lower than ethanol extract from the same species (22.17+- 0.89vs. 27.49 +- 0.94 mg AE/g dw). The same trend was observedin this study for the A. laxmannii, the TIC being 15.37 +- 0.77and 16.28 +- 0.85 mg AE/g dw for methanol and ethanol extract,respectively.Identification and Quantification ofPolyphenolic CompoundsIn order to determine the polyphenolic compounds fromA. laxmannii extracts, an optimized HPLC/MS method forthe identification and quantification of 18 polyphenols wasemployed. The A. laxmannii extracts contain one caffeic acidderivative (chlorogenic acid), corresponding to peak 1, withm/z 353, three flavonoid glycosides (isoquercitrin, rutin, andquercitrin), corresponding to peaks 2, 3, and 4, with m/z 463, 609,and 447, respectively. Additionally, two free aglycones (luteolinand apigenin), with m/z 285 and 279, corresponding to peaks 5and 6 were identified.The HPLC chromatogram of A. laxmannii ethanol extract(Figure 1), and the amounts of polyphenols identified in theanalyzed extracts expressed as ug/g dw are presented (Table 2).Rutin, an important flavonoid glycoside, was the majorcompound found in a significant quantity, both in ethanol andmethanol extract (6883.48 +- 9.12 and 6721.49 +- 8.92 ug/gdw, respectively). Various studies showed the effectivenessof rutin in various diseases such as inflammatory boweldisease and Alzheimer's disease (Kim et al., 2005; Xuet al., 2014). Another flavonoid glycoside compoundwhich was found and quantified in ethanol and methanolA. laxmannii extracts was isoquercitrin, which is known tohave good anti-inflammatory effects (Rogerio et al., 2007).The quantities obtained are significant lower than thoseobtained for rutin, but still important (685.35 +- 5.72 and636.1 +- 5.44 ug/g dw), for ethanol and methanol extracts,respectively.Considering the correlation between the type of the extractand the quantity of a particular compound, with one exception,all extracts showed similar values. Only in case of luteolin, themethanol extract showed a lower value than the ethanol extract(88.24+- 1.09 vs. 122.27+- 1.14 ug/g dw).Identification and Quantification ofPhytosterolsUnder the proposed chromatographic conditions, retentiontimes of the five analyzed sterols were: 3.2 min for ergosterol,3.9 min for brassicasterol, 4.9 min for stigmasterol andcampesterol (co-elution) and 5.7 min for b-sitosterol. The ionsmonitorized in the MS method are presented in Table 3. Inthe ionization conditions all sterols have lost a water molecule,therefore the ions detected by the mass spectrometer are alwaysin the form [M-H2O+H]+.The pseudo-molecular ions of sterols (379 for ergosterol,381 for brassicasterol, 395 for stigmasterol, 383 for campesterol,and 397 for b-sitosterol) have been fragmented, and basedon their daughter ions from the MS spectrum the extractedFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7258fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 8Toiu et al.

Values are the mean +- SD (n = 3).chromatograms of each compound were constructed. Themethod can also be applied for quantitative determinationbecause the intensity of ions in the mass spectrum is proportionalto the concentration of the substance in the sample.In order to quantify the five sterols from A. laxmannii extracts(EE, PEE, CE), we have constructed the extracted chromatogramsfor each compound, taking into account the intensity of majorions in the mass spectrum (Table 3).Calibration curves were obtained from standard solutions atdifferent concentration levels, selected as representative of therange of concentration in the sample. Regression analysis ofvarious concentrations of standard solutions (0.08-8 ug/mL)gave good correlation coefficients for the calibration curvesof sterols. Concentrations of phytosterols in A. laxmanniiextracts are presented in Table 4.
