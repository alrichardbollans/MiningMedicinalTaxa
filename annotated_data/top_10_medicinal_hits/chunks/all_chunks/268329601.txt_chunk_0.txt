AN INTRODUCTION1.1 ! SCOPEUniversity courses in the United States that surveyuseful plants have been around for only a century orso. I suspect that the first class offered in the UnitedStates was at Harvard College in 1876. When I was anundergraduate, such courses were called "EconomicBotany" or "Economic Plants." When I joined thefaculty at Humboldt State in 1969, I was asked todevelop a course in Economic Botany. These titleswere rather simple and descriptive, or so theyseemed. Students were sometimes surprised todiscover that their professors were spending time onmore obscure food plants or discussing other plantswith little economic importance, such as arrowpoisons. The adjective "economic" could certainlysuggest that these plants would be those ofinternational commerce - the plants where significantsums of money could be made or lost.To address this problem, and frankly to come up withnames that had more sex appeal, colleges anduniversities now often use titles such as "Plants andCivilization" or "Ethnobotany." In both instances,however, some confusion and controversy remains.The first suggests emphasis on more highlydeveloped, modern civilizations. Some definitions ofethnobotany restrict it to so-called primitive oraboriginal plant uses.Here is a sample of how various authors haveattempted to define these terms.Economic plants "... are those plants utilized eitherdirectly or indirectly for the benefit of Man. Indirectusage includes the needs of Man's livestock and themaintenance of the environment; the benefits may bedomestic, commercial, environmental, or aesthetic." (Wickens, 1990)Aboriginal botany is the study of "... all forms of thevegetable world which the aborigines used formedicine, food, textile fabrics, ornamentals, etc." (Powers, 1874)Economic botany includes any area "... where plantscience impinges on the economic life of man.... [It]is the simple study and description of economic plants,their culture, products, preparation, uses,occurrences, and distribution." (Fosberg, 1948)"... emphasizes the uses of plants, their potential forincorporation into another (usually Western) culture,and that their benefactors have indirect contact withthe plants through their by-products. In the botanicaltradition ethnobotany is subsidiary to economicbotany...." (Ford, 1978)"... usually concerns such subjects as the production,distribution and consumption of plants useful topeople... [It] is ... a subdivision of ethnobotany thatis involved when money becomes an importantconsideration. "(Heiser, 1985)"...the study of plants either useful or harmful topeople." (M. Balick, 1985)"... the study of the identification, properties, uses,and distribution of economic plants." (Wickens, 1990)"... the study of human evaluation and manipulationof plant materials, substances, and phenomena,including relevant concepts, in primitive or unletteredsocieties." (Schultes & von Reis, 1995)Ethnobotany is the study of "... plants used byprimitive and aboriginal people. "(Attributed to Harshberger, 1895)"... is concerned with the totality of the place of plantsin a culture and the direct interaction by the peoplewith the plants." (Ford, 1978)"..."the study of the direct interrelations betweenhuman populations and their botanical environment." (Ford, 1981)"... the study of plants in relation to people. "(Heiser, 1985)is the subdivision of economic botany that involves "...the investigation of plants employed by peopleindigenous to a particular area."(M. Balick, 1985)"... Today, the term denotes the entire realm of usefulrelationships between plants and man." (Manilal, 1988)"... the study of useful plants prior to theircommercial exploitation and eventual domestication....Unfortunately the term ethnobotany can still contain,especially to the laymen, a slightly derogatory flavour,the implication of racially inferior societies." (Wickens, 1990)"...the study of the interactive relationships betweennonindustrial societies and their floral environment. "(Lipp, 1995)"... which concern the mutual relationship betweenplants and traditional peoples." (Cotton, 1996)"... the study of the interactions of plants and people,including the influence of plants on human culture....The field of study that analyzes the results ofindigenous manipulation of plant materials togetherwith the cultural context in which the plants are used. "(Balick & Cox, 1996)"The scientific study of the traditional classificationand uses of plants in different human societies." (Encarta World English Dictionary, 1999)RELATED FIELDS OF STUDYAbout a century ago, fields of study that had oncebeen subsumed under "botany" were carved out asseparate disciplines and given their own names,particularly those aspects of botany that had applied,-1-practical applications. Unfortunately, what remainedas "botany" then seemed very esoteric and remotefrom our everyday life.Because these fields deal with useful plants, they maybe seen as portions of the broader designation"Economic Botany." The second edition of the"Random House Dictionary of the English Language"offers the following definitions for related fields ofstudy:agriculture: the science, art, or occupationconcerned with cultivating land, raising crops, andfeeding, breeding, and raising livestock; farmingagronomy: the science of soil management and theproduction of field cropsforestry: the science of planting and taking care oftrees and forestshorticulture: the cultivation of a garden, orchard, ornursery; the cultivation of flowers, fruits, vegetables,or ornamental plantsHOW MANY USEFUL PLANTS?A good starting point might be to look at the numberof described species in each of the major groups ofplants and other organisms. In the older literature,algae and fungi were considered plants.Plants:Mosses/liverworts 16,500Fern relatives 1,300Ferns 10,000Gymnosperms 529Flowering plants (dicots) 170,000Flowering plants (monocots) 50,000Subtotal 248,329Others:Algae 26,900Fungi 47,000Bacteria 4,800Viruses 1,000Protozoa 30,800Insects 751,000Animals (all other) 281,000Total 1,390,829This summary suggests that botanists and zoologists have described about 1.4 million species. How manyundescribed ones are still out there? One estimate is5 million to 30 million, most of them insects!We have found some groups of the plant kingdom tobe rich sources of useful species, while others haveproven less so.' The vast majority of the plants that we haveexploited to date have been flowering plants. Thisis not too surprising since there are so many ofthem.' The conifers (gymnosperms) are the source of anumber of important timber trees and woodproducts.' The ferns and their relatives provide a few usefulplants.' We have found very few uses for mosses andliverworts.' There are a number of useful fungi and algae.Just how many economically important plants arethere? Surprisingly, there are few estimates that havebeen published. The following is based on a recentcompilation (Wiersema & Leon, 1999).Food (human) 1,049Food (additives) 382Food (animal: fodder) 269Food (animal: fForage) 466Bee Plants (honey) 134Medicinal 738Psychoactive (recreational) 39Gene sources 614Industrial 1,583Fuels 145Agroforestry 52Shade and shelter 188Toxic (vertebrates) 1,293Toxic (pesticides) 28Ornamentals 4,332Weeds 1,570Total 12,882HOW ARE THEY USED ?Several uses come immediately to mind, such asplants used for food, fiber for clothing, wood forconstruction, and a number of our medicines. But,there are many other uses that are perhaps lessobvious. Here is a much more comprehensivesummary:Sources of Nourishment' Directly as food' Fats and oils in cooking' Flavorings (sugars, herbs, spices)Beverages' Caffeinated beverages' Alcoholic beverages' Fruit drinks' Herbal teas-2-Food for Our Domesticated Animals' Grains' Fodder' SilageArticles of Clothing' Cover ourselves' Footwear (made from fibers and latex)' Masks' Hats (straw, Panama hats, pith helmets)Construction Materials' Dwellings (thatch, framework, etc.)' Interior walls' Furniture' Carpeting, linoleum, mats, etc.' Bridges' ScaffoldingIndustrial Uses' Gums' Resins' Sizings' Starches' Waxes' Polishes' Essential oils' Fixed oils' Paints' Plastics' Dyes' Tannins' Fermentation by micro-organismsMeans of Transportation' Canoes, boats, ships' Rubber tires' Engine lubricants' FuelsTreatment of Illness & Disorders' Treat specific illnesses' Pain killers' Sedatives and stimulants' Antibiotics' Increase or decrease fertilityCleansing' Soaps' ShampoosBeautification' Cosmetics' Lipsticks' Perfumes' Hair dyes and conditioners' Deodorants' Toothpastes, dental or chewing sticks' Ornamentation (body painting, etc. )Recreation and Entertainment' Paints and ink' Photography' Gardening' Sports (baseball and cricket bats)' Golf balls' Musical instrumentsPreserve/Transmit Our Heritage' Even today, paper remains the mediumSources of Beauty and Inspiration' Gardens' Wilderness, etc.' Florists' ParksObjects of Study' Botany' Horticulture' Agronomy' Forestry' AgricultureSpiritual Activities' Sacred plants as objects of worship' Myths' Magical powers (positive and negative)' Purification rites' Sanctification rites' Initiation ceremonies' Ordeal rituals' Alter our perception of the world' Commune with deities, etc.Abuse and Misuse' Destruction of natural environments' Enslavement to grow and process crops' Destruction of cultures' Political and economic instability' Population growth as a result ' Dependence on a few plants' Victims of poisonings and disease' Kill people with themAnd, plants are not just for our use ...' Air quality' Water quality' Soil maintenance' Climate' Food for wild animals' Habitat for wildlife and fishBASIC CONCEPTS OF PLANT USE' All animal life is dependent upon plants (directly orindirectly) because they convert solar energy tofood, replenish the oxygen supply, and provide thecaloric base for all food chains.' In addition to satisfying our basic needs for food,clothing, and shelter our interaction with plants hastouched almost every aspect of our life on earth.' We use only a few of the quarter of a million or soplant species that are potentially available.' We have found only one use for some plants, whileothers have several uses. A particular plant mayhave had several very different uses throughhistory.' Many plants are grown and used locally, and neverenter into international trade.' The vast majority of our economically importantplants are flowering plants, probably because oftheir number and relative commonness.-3-' Micro-organisms, especially bacteria and yeast,play critical roles even though we often fail toobserve their presence or activities.' The search for plants and our desire to control theirproduction and sale have been the cause of greatfeats of exploration, political intrigue, and wars.' The planting, tending, and processing of crops havebeen among our major preoccupations and wehave employed or have been willing to enslavemillions of our fellow humans to perform thesetasks.' While the plant kingdom is the source of aseemingly endless array of products, we appear tobe especially interested in starch, protein, sugar,alcohol, and alkaloids.' The process of "trial and error" has been critical indiscovering what is edible, toxic, medicinal, andpsychoactive.' The knowledge of indigenous peoples has oftenbeen an invaluable source of information aboutplant uses or it may be pure malarkey. The trick isto distinguish the two.' We have long believed (incorrectly anddangerously) that the general appearance of aplant provides us with clues as to its use, especiallyits curative powers.' Several of the most important families ofeconomically useful plants are easily recognizedand have been well-known for millennia.' Usefulness is a concept found in humans, pre-humans, and perhaps a few other animals. Someplants may never be useful to us. They are simplythere.1.2 !
