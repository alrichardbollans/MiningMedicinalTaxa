Thymol methyl ether was the second most important compo-nent in oil of cultivated plants in the pre-flowering stage (12.4%), flow-ering stage (16.6%) and full fruiting stage (23.6%). This component wasmissing in the oils of plants in the fruiting stage, which contained ahigh concentration of cis-sabinene hydrate. In the oil obtained fromplants in other stages, cis-sabinene hydrate varies between 0.7% and1.2%. Oils of plants from the natural populations were rich in thymol(37.6%), carvacrol (13.2%) and p-cymene (11.1%) in the pre-floweringstage. The amount of p-cymene rises sharply in the oil of plant in postfruiting stage (57.14%), while the amount of thymol and carvacroldrops significantly (1.3%; 0.4%). S. montana subsp. pisidica contained much more essential oil in thepre-flowering stage (0.8%) compared to the post-flowering stage (0.3%).The plants from the natural population were very rich in oil (1.2%). Inthe pre-flowering stage the oil obtained from cultivated plants con-tained mostly carvacrol (43.5%), g-terpinene (17.5%) and thymol(11.1%). In the post-flowering stage the concentration of these com-ponents decreases (19.3%; 5.6%; 5.2%), while p-cymene (30%) andlinalool (13.7%) emerge as dominant. In the oil of plants in the pre-flowering stage the p-cymene content amounted to 5.3%, while theconcentration of linalool was very low, 0.85%. Plants collected fromnatural habitat exhibited a domination of p-cymene (24.9%), cis-sabinene hydrate (15.4%) and thymol (11.1%). Cis-sabinene hydrate inoil of cultivated plants appeared in a 1% concentration in pre-flower-199Macedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANTSposter presentationsFIFTH CONGRESS OF PHARMACY OF MACEDONIA WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATIONing plants and 1.4% in plants in the post-flowering stage. The high degree of variation in the oil content, as well as qualitativeand quantitative composition of the volatile constituents, revealed astrong influence of environmental conditions and phenological stageson the nature of plant chemical composition that has an importantrole in plant adaptation.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTSThis work is supported by the Ministry of Science and TechnologicalDevelopment of the Republic of Serbia, through grant No. 173021 and173030.REFERENCES1.

Asllani31Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tirana,Albania.2Kosova Medicines Agency, Prishtina, Kosova.3R&D Department, Alb-Ducros, AlbaniaINTRODUCTION Salvia officinalis L. (Sage) is distributed all over Albania from 50-1200m, especially in calcareous formation. The extracts and essential oilsof sage are used as spice and for healing of different diseases. Its es-sential oils of various chemotypes (cis-thujone, 1,8-cineole, camphoretc.) exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, antimi-crobial and stimulant properties. Albania exports 1500-1700 tons of sage leaves annually, while theother 1500 tons of leaves are used for the production of the oil. About60% is exported to the USA. Sage is cultivated in few regions of Kosova, especially the last years. The variability of the composition of Salvia offficinalis L. essential oilsfrom different regions of Albania and Kosova was determinated in thisstudy. MATERIALS AND METHODS The plant materials for distillation were collected from wild growingpopulations of sage in different parts of Albania (Kukes, Dajti, Elbasan,Berat, Tepelena, Llogara) and from cultivated population of sage inthe region of Istog (Kosova), during the flowering period. The air-driedplant materials, were subjected to hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus according to standard procedures. The essential oils were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-14B (FID detec-tor) fitted with a fused silica column HP-5MS (60m x 0.25mm, filmthickness 0.25mm), split 1: 60, temperature programmed from 60deg-240degC at 2degC/min with helium as the carrier gas at the flow rate of 1.0ml/min, sample injection 2 ml. The injector and detector temperatureswere kept at 250oC and 270oC respectively. GC/MS analyses of the oilswere run on a Hewlett-Packard mass spectrometer HP 5970 B, ionsource 70 eV, coupled with a gas chromatograph HP 5890A with fusedsilica capillary column 50m x 0.21mm, film thickness 0.30mm, coatedwith SE-54 temperature programmed from 50deg-260degC at 2degC/min usingHelium as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The essentialoil of sample from Kosova was analyzed using a GC/MS Agilent 7890A,temperature programmed from 60deg-260degC at 5degC/min using Helium asthe carrier gas with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Identification of indi-vidual components was made by comparison of their retention timeswith those of analytical standards and by computer searching, match-ing mass spectral data with those held in Wiley / NBS library of Massspectra. For quantification purposes were used area percent reports,obtained by GC (FID). RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe essential oils yield of Albanian sage samples ranged from 1.8% -2.5% and 1.57% from Kosova sample. The GC and GC/MS results re-ported that the quantitative of major compounds in the essential oilsof Albanian sage samples ranged as follows: 1,8 cineole from 12.64%(Tepelena) to 23.38% (Berat); a-thujone from 13.12% (Berat) to 25.41%( Kukes); a-thujone from 2.10% (Llogara) to 6.67% (Kukes); camphorefrom 20.63% (Kukes) to 36.5% (Tepelena); borneol from 3.12% to 8.28%( Llogara); a-caryophyllene from 4.26% (Kukes) to 7.20% (Tepelene). Themajor compounds in the sage essential oil from Kosova sample were:1,8 cineole 12.68%; a-thujone 22.01%; a-thujone 3.03%; camphor10.75%; d-ledol 8.63%; a-caryophyllene 6.28%; a-humulene 5.68%.CONCLUSION The essential oils of the investigated Albania sage reveal a large vari-ability, containing different percentages of common compounds. Weconcluded that Albanian sage species could be grouped into chemo-types with 1,8 cineol and borneol; a-thujone and a-thujone chemo-type; camphor and sesquiterpene chemotypes. Close examination ofthe GC and GC/MS data reveals that sage oil from region of Kosovapossessed higher quantity of sesquiterpene and lower quantity of cam-phor in contrast with the oils from Albanian regions. Meanwhile, sim-ilar quantity of 1,8 cineole and a-thujone in essential oils from Kosovaand north/south regions of Albania are detected.

(Lamiaceae) is a small evergreen which growswild in most Mediterranean countries. It is cultivated in Albania and iswidespread in southern and central regions. Rosmarinus officinalis L.(Rosemary) is one of the most important aromatic plant exported fromAlbania. The therapeutic properties of rosemary oil are analgesic,carminative, cholagogue, digestive, diuretic, emmenagogue, nervine,rubifacient, stimulant, improving memory etc. The oil finds its mainuse in the perfumery industry and is frequently used in aromatherapy. The aim of the study is the determination of chemical composition ofessential oils from Albanian rosemary species, as a contribution to thecharacterization of their geographical and biochemical variability.MATERIALS AND METHODS Aerial parts of rosemary plants were collected, at full flowering, in dif-ferent parts of south (Fier, Vlora, Berat) and central Albania (Tirana,Durres) during years 2007-2009. Voucher specimens of population aredeposited at the Herbarium of Faculty of Science, University of Tirana.The air-dried plant materials, were subjected to hydrodistillation usinga Clevenger-type apparatus according to standard procedures. The essential oils were analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-14B (FID detec-tor) fitted with a fused silica column HP-5MS (60m x 0.25mm, filmthickness 0.25mm), split 1: 60, temperature programmed from 60deg-240degC at 2degC/min with helium as the carrier gas at the flow rate of 1.0mL/min, sample injection 2 mL. GC/MS analyses of the oils were run ona Hewlett-Packard mass spectrometer HP 5970 B, ion source 70 eV,coupled with a gas chromatograph HP 5890A with fused silica capillarycolumn 50m x 0.21mm, film thickness 0.30mm, coated with SE-54 tem-perature programmed from 50deg-260degC at 2degC/min using Helium as thecarrier gas with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min.Identification of individual components was made by comparison oftheir retention times with those of analytical standards and by com-puter searching, matching mass spectral data with those held in Wiley/ NBS library of Mass spectra. For quantification purposes were usedarea percent reports, obtained by FID. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe results reported that the quantitative yield of rosemary essentialoils, expressed in terms of percentage of dry matter, ranged from 1.2%(samples from Vlora) to 2% (samples from Durres). Over 25 compounds were detected in the oils, from which 20 could beidentified. The principal constituents identified were 1,8 cineole, cam-phor, verbenone, borneol, a-terpineol, linalool, terpinolene, limonene,a-pinene, ss-caryophyllene, a-humulene etc. Examinated of the quan-titative data reveals that the major components vary depending uponthe region. The ranges found for the main constituents were as fol-lows: 1,8 cineole from 12.04% (Vlora) to 16.67% (Tirana); camphor from9.91% (Vlora) to 16% (Fier); verbenone from 6.8% (Durres) to 12.59%(Fier); a-terpineol from 12.12% (Durres) to 20.88% (Fier); a-pinene 9.55%(Vlora) - 17.65% (Durres); borneol from 5.21% (Durres) to 9.8% (Fier) etc. The total of oxygenated constituents range from 44.13% (Durres) to66.07% (Fier) and the hydrocarbons compounds range from 13.34%(Vlora) to 27.22% (Tirana). CONCLUSION Rosemary plants cultivated in Albania have a high content of essentialoil.Compared with other rosemary oils, Albanian oils were more similarto those of Italian origin due to their 1.8 cineole, camphor, a-pinenecontents. Close examination of the GC and GC/MS data reveals thatrosemary oils from center regions of Albania possessed higher quan-tity of hydrocarbons, especially monoterpene hydrocarbons and lowerquantity of oxygenated constituents in contrast with the oils fromsouthern regions that possessed higher quantity of oxygenated com-ponents.
