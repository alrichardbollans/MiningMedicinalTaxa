Another study reported that the inhibitory activity ofNF-kB is due to the binding of GS to the RH domain of NF-kBprecursor protein p105 containing important sequences for DNAbinding and dimerization (Khan et al., 2013).B. serrata, commonly known as salai guggul, Indian olibanum,loban, or kundur, belongs to the Burseraceae family and is foundin dry mountainous regions of India, Northern Africa, and theMiddle East. Burseraceae family includes 17 genera and 600species of plants. The genus Boswellia has 25 different speciesdistributed throughout the tropical regions. B. serrata is one suchmedicinal plant which exhibits immense potential to combatvarious chronic disorders. The active pharmacological principleFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68656Kunnumakkara et al. Googling the Guggulof the oleo gum resin from the trees of different Boswelliaspecies is the BA (Buchele et al., 2003; Du et al., 2015; Royet al., 2016). The gum resin of the Boswellia species mainlyconsists of mucus, resin acids, and volatile oil with differentquantitative composition from species to species. The gum resinof salai guggul contains pentacyclic triterpenic acids, namelya-boswellic acids, b-boswellic acids, g-boswellic acid, acetyl-b-boswellic acid, 11-keto-b-boswellic acid (KBA), acetyl-11-keto-b-boswellic acid (AKBA), and tetracyclic triterpenic acids liketirucallic acids viz 3-oxotirucallic acid, 3-hydroxytirucallic acid,and 3-acetoxytirucallic acid (Figure 2B). Other oleo gum resincompounds which display biological activities are: betulinicacid, lupenoic acid, epi-lupeol, isoincensole, isoincensole acetateand 1-ursene-2-diketone-incensole acetate along with few otherterpenes that can be found in volatile oil (Du et al., 2015; Ammon,2016; Roy et al., 2016).MOLECULAR TARGETS OF COMMIPHORAAND BOSWELLIAGS suppresses the physiological action of the FXR which isa nuclear hormone receptor that controls the synthesis andtransport of bile acid (Sinal and Gonzalez, 2002; Urizar et al.,2002). However, it increases the transcription of bile salt exportpump (BSEP) which is majorly involved in hepatic bile acidtransport (Cui et al., 2003). Besides regulating transport of bileacid, GS is a potent anti-inflammatory agent which suppressesLPS-induced NO production (Meselhy, 2003). GS has also beenreported to inhibit the activation of NF-kB by suppressing thelevels of receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) (Ichikawaand Aggarwal, 2006). In 2004, Shishodia and group reportedthat GS suppressed the activation of NF-kB and IkB-a kinaseand exhibited antiproliferative activity by inhibiting c-Myc andcyclin D1. Furthermore, GS has also been found to exert anti-metastatic effect through reducing the levels of MMP-9, COX-2, and VEGF (Shishodia and Aggarwal, 2004). This group alsoreported that GS induced apoptosis bymodulating the expressionof anti-apoptotic genes, IAP1, XIAP, Bcl-2, cFLIP, Bfl-1/A1, andsurvivin (Shishodia and Aggarwal, 2004). Further, GS has alsobeen found to induce tumor cell apoptosis by activating theapoptotic genes, caspase-3,-8,-9, and inducing the release ofcytochrome c, cleavage of bid and PARP. This was controlled byactivated mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MKK4) mediatedupregulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and suppressionof Akt. The antiproliferative activity of GS was found to besupported by reduced levels of cyclin D1, cdc2, and simultaneousupregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27(Figure 3A; Shishodia et al., 2007).Boswellic acid is known to inhibit leukotriene synthesis byinhibiting 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) (Safayhi et al., 1992, 1995;Ammon et al., 1993). This 5-LOX inhibitor has also been foundto reduce the activity of human leukocyte elastase (HLE) in vitro(Safayhi et al., 1997). Suppression of these molecules contributesto anti-inflammatory action of Boswellia. Boswellia is also knownto induce apoptosis in cancer cells. In 2007, Bhushan and groupreported that a triterpenediol from B. serrata induced apoptosisin HL-60 cells through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways(Bhushan et al., 2007). In the first case, the triterpenediol wasfound to disturb the mitochondrial membrane potential, reduceBcl-2/Bax ratio and cause release of AIF, Smac/DIABLO, andcytochrome c from the mitochondria along with suppressionof survivin and upregulation of caspases-3,-8, and-9, therebyleading to the cleavage of ICAD and PARP while in the secondcase, the oxidative stress generated in the cells due to excessiveROS and NO production triggered the activation of TNF-R1and DR4 followed by activation of caspase-8. Another study inmultiple myeloma cells also suggested that BA acetate inducesapoptosis by upregulating death receptor proteins, DR4 and DR5which subsequently leads to the activation of caspase-8 followedby caspase-3 (Xia et al., 2005). The role of DR5-mediated pathwaywhich involves activation of CAAT/enhancer binding proteinhomologous protein (CHOP) was reported in AKBA-mediatedapoptosis of prostate cancer cells (Lu et al., 2008). Caspase-8activation has also been reported in other BA-induced apoptosisstudies (Liu et al., 2002a,b). In 2002, Park et al. hypothesized thatAKBA contributed in the process of proliferation and apoptosisof tumors by inhibiting platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK-1and ERK-2) (Park et al., 2002b). BA mediated apoptosis has alsobeen evident in cancer cells via activation of p21, an importantcell cycle regulator protein (Glaser et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2006).Apart from this, AKBA has been found to interfere with IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling via protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1subsequently causing downregulation of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and VEGF, thus impeding proliferation, survival andangiogenesis of multiple myeloma cells (Kunnumakkara et al.,2009). Moreover, BA has also been found to suppress metastaticgrowth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), chemokinereceptor; CXCR4 and angiogenic factor; VEGFR 2 (Singh et al.,2007; Pang et al., 2009; Park et al., 2011a). Further, in vivo studieshave unveiled that BA regulates proliferation and metastasis ofcancer cells by downregulating other targets like COX-2, c-Myc,cyclin D1, MMP-9, VEGF, ICAM-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, andcellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (IAP-1) (Park et al.,2011a,b; Yadav et al., 2012). Most of these genes are regulated bythe transcription factor, NF-kB which is also downregulated byBA (Syrovets et al., 2005a,b; Takada et al., 2006). Furthermore,BA has also been shown to regulate the activity of P-glycoprotein(Pgp) which is an important class of drug transporters (Weberet al., 2006). It is also an inhibitor of topoisomerases I and II incancer cells (Hoernlein et al., 1999; Syrovets et al., 2000; Zhaoet al., 2003). The anticancer activity of this potential compoundalso involves regulation of let-7 and miR-200 microRNA family(Figure 3B; Takahashi et al., 2012).THERAPEUTIC PROPERTIES OF GUGGULCongregate evidences show guggul to be profoundly effectiveagainst diverse chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,arthritis, cancer, pancreatitis, IBD, dermatitis, diabetes, infectiousdiseases, intestinal metaplasia, otitis media, respiratorydiseases, asthma, psoriasis, gingivitis etc. Besides, it alsoFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68657Kunnumakkara et al.

V. et al., 2007; Shah et al., 2012; Roy et al.,2016). GS induced apoptosis in cancer cells via inhibition ofNF-kB, activation of JNK and downregulation of Akt and anti-apoptotic proteins (Shishodia and Aggarwal, 2004; Shishodiaet al., 2007). Treatment with GS led to the inhibition of DNAsynthesis and proliferation of leukemia cells via downregulationof cyclin D1, cdc2, and upregulation of p21 and p27 (Samudioet al., 2005; Shishodia et al., 2007). In addition, B. serrata gumresin displayed cytostatic and apoptosis-inducing effect againstleukemia and brain tumor cells (Hostanska et al., 2002). Further,GS induced cell death in prostate cancer cells by reactive oxygenintermediate (ROI)-dependent activation of JNK, p38MAPK andalso activation of ERK1/2 (Singh S. V. et al., 2007; Xiao andSingh, 2008). Additionally, AKBA inhibited the proliferation andFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68658Kunnumakkara et al.
