Nucleoplasmic bridge is an indicator for the occurrence of dicentric chromosomes resulting from DNA mis-repair or telomere end-fusions (Haaf et al., 1999; Umegaki & Fenech, 2000). The incidence of micronucleated mononucleate counted in AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells also did not exhibit a statistically significant difference between the doses of andrographolide except at 90pM where the compound was clearly cytotoxic as shown in Table 3.6.Table 3.6.

The numbers in brackets represent the cell lines.Linear regression analysis on the incidence o f micronuclei revealed that the probability of dose-response relationship for the doses tested to be not significant, thus higher doses of andrographolide may not induce more micronuclei.The data obtained also demonstrated that these three cell lines exhibited different frequency of micronuclei indicating that the properties of these cell lines may be attributed to such incidence. Table 3.7 compares the micronuclei values for the cell lines tested where andrographolide at lOpM caused significant incremental increases of micronuclei frequency in AHH-1 and V-79, with the values registered for these cell lines were significantly lower than that observed in MCL-5, hence MCL-5 was capable of tolerating the presence of andrographolide at this dose. At 30pM of the phytochemical, there was significant difference between micronuclei induction in MCL-5 and V-79 but not between MCL-5 and AHH-1 norCopy 1 130Y. SharifuddinChapter 3those of AHH-1 and V-79. No difference was observed at 50pM of andrographolide. It can be proposed that MCL-5 superior metabolic capacity plays a role in this observation.The levels of andrographolide cytotoxicity were measured using different methods. Mean cytotoxicity percentages tabulated in Tables 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 were calculated using the equation (1) that measured cell replicative index (RI) and cytotoxicity values were derived from equation (2) as stated in Section 3.5.9. Andrographolide cytotoxicity in all cell lines tested upon, exhibited a steady increase in tandem with dose where 70 and 90jliM of the phytochemical caused cell death and reduced cell viability in more than 50% of cells.Apart from RI calculations on cytotoxicity, cell death was also measured via microscopical identification of necrotic and apoptotic cells. The results obtained were tabulated and the significant difference (p<0.05) against the negative controls for necrotic and apoptotic cells were shown in Tables 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 respectively. It was found that the trend witnessed in RI cytotoxicity calculations was mirrored in the incidence of necrotic and apoptotic cells in all cell lines. The data also revealed that the cells died primarily via necrosis compared to apoptosis. There was significant dose-dependent accruement of necrotic cells and comparable to the RI cytotoxicity values, the concentration of 70 and 90pM of andrographolide induced more than 50% of cell population to die via necrosis. The percentage of apoptotic cells in all cell lines increased with dose until 30pM but beginning from 50pM to the highest concentration of andrographolide tested, the values started to dwindle. None of the concentrations tested cause apoptosis more than 2% of the cell populations in the cell lines tested. However, 30 and 50jjM andrographolide produced higher number of apoptotic response in AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells relative to other concentrations and statistically significant against the negative controls. In V-79 cells, 30jnM of andrographolide produced 1.38% of apoptotic cells which is statistically significant compared to negative controls. More than 50% of AHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79 cells died via necrosis compared to less than 0.45% of apoptotic cells at the top doses of 70 and 90pM, a value that was generally less than those observed in negative control. Reduced cell number was also observed on the scored slides as the concentration of andrographolide increased.The dose of andrographolide that caused more than 1% of apoptotic cells were observed to be those that caused micronuclei induction, which were 30 and 50pM respectively.Copy I 131Y.

SharifuddinChapter 3Determination of the influence of treatment duration on andrographolide exposure was also conducted with the aim of determining the prevalent mode of cell death preformed using only MCL-5 cell line. As tabulated below in Table 3.11, MCL-5 cells incubated for 8 hours in the presence of andrographolide showed a similar trend to longer duration treatment of 24 hours.The data were presented graphically in Figure 3.16.Table 3.11.

A graph to show the induction o f necrotic and apoptotic cell death in MCL-5 cells exposed to andrographolide for 8 hours.The cells died mainly via necrosis as opposed to apoptosis. However, the percentage of necrotic cells was lower than those of apoptotic cells, particularly at 30 and 50juM which were also the dose that induced high micronuclei in MCL-5 cells. For example, in reference to Tables 3.9 and 3.11 at 30pM of andrographolide, 35.55% of cells were necrotic compared to 18.08% during 8 hours incubation but the value for apoptotic cells were not different from each other at 1.27%(24 hours) and 1.30%(8 hours) respectively. This data demonstrated thatCopy 11 3 4Y. SharifuddinChapter 3the induction of necrosis in MCL-5 cells was time-dependent apart from relying on the concentration of the compound administered whereas apoptotic response was not. The percentage of apoptotic cells was similar between short and longer treatment periods.Cellular viability was also assessed using the trypan-blue exclusion assay and three replicate experiments were performed on AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells whilst retaining the same dose range used in CBMA studies. The results are tabulated in Tables 3.12 and 3.13 for the two cell lines respectively. Correspondingly, cell count data revealed that cell growth was also reduced when the dose increased. MCL-5 cells exposed to andrographolide for one cell cycle also exhibited a same trend as observed in AHH-1. There was a reduction in both cell viability and cell growth. Figures 3.17 and 3.18 compares the values of non-viable cells and cell growth inhibition in AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells. Andrographolide seemed to have a relatively more profound effect (p<0.05) on MCL-5 cell growth than on AHH-1 cells evident from cell growth inhibition values at the same concentration of the phytochemical due to cytotoxicity as shown in Table 3.14.Therefore, cumulatively all the data generated on the cytotoxicity of andrographolide using RI calculation, microscopical identification and trypan-blue exclusion assay painted a similar picture where this diterpene lactone phytochemical affects cell growth and caused cell death primarily via necrosis in a dose-dependent manner. However, apoptotic response was observed to be highest at 30 and 50pM, which also elicit high micronuclei formation.Table 3.12.

A line graph comparing the effect o f increasing concentration o f andrographolide at various concentrations on the growth o f MCL-5 and AHH-1 cells exposed to the phytochemical for 24 hours.In order to elucidate the mechanism through which andrographolide induces micronuclei, kinetochore labelling utilising CREST anti-kinetochore antibodies was performed on treated MCL-5 cells. A total of 60 binucleates harbouring micronuclei were scored for the presence or absence of kinetochore within the micronuclei. Three replicates of experiment with new stocks of andrographolide were performed yielding a grand total of 180 micronuclei scored per dose. The data obtained were tabulated and graphically presented in Table 3.15 and Figure 3.19 respectively. Clearly, andrographolide possesses the propensity to cause the loss of whole chromosomes with increasing dose indicated by the increasing frequency of kinetochore positive micronuclei compared to untreated cells. Andrographolide induced 0.40% micronuclei in MCL-5 cells at 50pM, which was the highest value recorded and more than 70% of the micronuclei scored were positive indicating the presence of chromosomes with centromere. Thus, this phytochemical acts in aneugenic manner causing the loss of whole chromosomes that were later manifested as micronuclei. Figure 3.20 overleaf shows images of kinetochore-positive micronuclei and a kinetochore-negative micronucleus observed using the Olympus BH2-RCF fluorescent microscope.Copy I 137Y.

SharifuddinChapter 3| 3.7 DISCUSSION|ii|Realising the medical potential of Andrographispaniculata especially andrographolide based on previous publications and the paucity of genotoxicity information on the compound, determining the genotoxicity potential of the phytochemical was deemed to be imperative.As discussed previously, in silico assessment of a compound of interest utilising CSAR was very useful but insufficient in drawing a reliable conclusion. The author showed that toxicity assessment of andrographolide employing an expert knowledge-based system DEREK, which anticipated the compound to be capable of causing chromosome damage in vitro due to the presence of a-alkylidene y-butyrolactone moiety. Furthermore, the author also employed METEOR, another knowledge-based program harnessing QSAR concept to predict biotranformation routes of andrographolide and its possible metabolites.
