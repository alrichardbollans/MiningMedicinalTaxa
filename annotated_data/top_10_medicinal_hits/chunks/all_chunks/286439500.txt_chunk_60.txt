Active fraction F6(2.5 g) was subjected to further separation on a Sephadex LH-20 (Pharmacia) column (25 x 3 cm) with H2O-MeOH (50:50,v/v) to obtain 20 fractions of 50mL each, which were pooled into6 main fractions (F6_1-F6_6) based on their TLC and HPLCprofiles. From fraction F6_2 (235mg), compounds I (75mg; Rt= 11.3-12.3min.) and II (13mg; Rt = 13.4-13.9); from fractionF6_3 (633mg), compounds III (78mg; Rt = 8.3-8.9min) andIV (90mg; Rt = 11.9-12.7min), from fraction F6_4 (243mg),compounds V (5mg; Rt= 12.0-12.3min), VI (23mg; Rt= 15.4-16.0min) andVII (7mg; Rt= 19.0-19.5min) were isolated usingpreparative HPLC with a gradient of 0.1%HCOOH in H2O-0.1%HCOOH in MeCN (80:20- 40:60) over 60min.Preparation of Solutions of Extracts,Fractions, and Compounds for BioassayTested extracts were dissolved in PBS or HBSS (1 mg/mL).Fractions and compounds were dissolved in DMSO (10 mg/mLor 10mM stock solutions) and then diluted with RPMI 1640medium. The extracts were tested in a concentration range of25-100ug/mL. Compounds were tested at concentrations of10-50uM. The concentration of DMSO used (<0.1%) did notinfluence the assays.Isolation of Human NeutrophilsPeripheral venous blood was taken from healthy human donors(18-35 years old) in theWarsaw Blood Donation Centre. Donorsdid not smoke or take any medications. They were clinicallyrecognized to be healthy and a routine laboratory tests showedall values to be within the normal ranges. The study conformedto the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.Neutrophils were isolated by dextran sedimentation andcentrifugation in a Ficoll Hypaque gradient (Boyum, 1968) andthen re-suspended in HBSS buffer or RPMI 1640 medium.CytotoxicityCytotoxicity was determined by a standard flow cytometric probeusing propidium iodide (PI) staining. After 24 h of incubationwith extracts/compounds, the neutrophils were harvested andcentrifuged (1500 RPM; 10min; 4*C), washed once with coldPBS and re-suspended in 400 uL of PBS. Five microliters of PI(50ug/mL) solution was added to the cell suspensions. After15min of incubation at room temperature, cells were analyzedby flow cytometry, and 10,000 events were recorded per sample.Cells that displayed high permeability to PI were expressed as apercentage of PI(+) cells.ROS ProductionNeutrophils (3.5 x 105) were incubated in HBSS buffer with50 uL of the tested extracts and 50 uL of luminol (20mM) ina 96-well plate. ROS production was initiated by the additionof f-MLP (0.1ug/mL) to obtain a total volume of 200 uL/well.Chemiluminescence changes were measured over 40min atintervals of 2min in a microplate reader. The backgroundchemiluminescence produced by non-stimulated cells was alsodetermined. The percentage of inhibition was calculated bycomparison to the control without the tested extracts at themaximum luminescence.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 349151Woz'niak et al. Effects of Syringa Secoiridoids on Mediators of InflammationIL-8, MMP-9, MCP-1, and TNF-aProductionNeutrophils (2 x 106) were cultured in 24-well plates in RPMI1640 medium with 10% FBS, 10mM HEPES, and 2mM L-glutamine in the presence or absence of LPS (100 ng/mL) for24 h at 37*C with 5% CO2 in the presence or absence oftest extracts/fractions/compounds. After 24 h, the neutrophilswere harvested and centrifuged (2000 RPM; 10min; 4*C). Theamount of released cytokines was measured by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) following the manufacturer'sinstructions (BD Biosciences, USA). The effects on IL-8, MMP-9, MCP-1, and TNF-a production were calculated by comparingthe percentages of the released agents to the stimulated control,which lacked the test extracts/fractions/compounds.Western BlottingNeutrophils (4 x 106) were suspended in RPMI 1640 mediumand incubated for 40min at 37*C in the presence or absenceof LPS (100 ng/mL) and in the presence or absence of thetest compounds. They were then centrifuged at 1500 RPM for10min at 4*C. Cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer containingPBS, 5mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, phosphatase and proteaseinhibitors, and the resulting lysates were centrifuged at 8,000RPM for 15min at 4*C. The proteins were separated by 12%SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters andimmunoblotted with rabbit anti-p38MAPK, anti-ERK1/2, andanti-JNK at 1:1000 dilutions and a rabbit anti-actin polyclonalantibody at a 1:2000 dilution. Peroxidase-conjugated affinipuregoat anti-rabbit antibody was used as a secondary antibody ata dilution of 1:10000. Finally, the blots were incubated withchemiluminescent substrate for the detection of HRP (Thermo-Scientific, USA) for 10-15min. Western blots were quantifiedusing the ImageJ 1.38 software after densitometric scanning ofthe bands.Statistical AnalysisThe results were expressed as the mean +- SEM of threeindependent experiments performed at least in duplicate. Allanalyses were performed using Statistica 9 software. Thestatistical significance of the differences between means wasestablished by ANOVA with Dunnett's or Tukey's post hoc test.P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.RESULTSPhytochemical Characterization andComparison of S. vulgaris From Bark, Fruit,Flower and Leaf Infusions and EthanolicExtractsThe phytochemical analysis of S. vulgaris bark, fruit, flowerand leaf infusions and ethanolic extracts was performedusing a HPLC-DAD-MS/MS method, which allowed for theidentification or partial identification of 64 compounds (Table 1and Figure 1) from the following groups: phenylethanoids(compounds 27, 31, 36, 39, and 42), rare phenylethanoidsesterified with an oleoside 11-methyl ester (compounds 43, 49,50, and 61), flavonoids (compounds 32, 33, and 35), otherphenolic compounds (1-3, 5-14, 17, 18, and 24), lignans(compounds 21 and 37), iridoids (compounds 34 and 41),secoiridoids (compounds 4, 15, 16, 20, 26, 28-30, 38, 40, 44-46, 48, 51-57, 60, 62, and 63), together with eight unknowncompounds. Compounds 1, 2, 5, 7, 14-16, 27-29, 34, 36, 38,41, 43-46, 48-50, 52-54, 61 were previously isolated as purecompounds from S. vulgaris leaves, flowers, and bark (Kurkinet al., 1989, 1990; Damtoft et al., 1995; Kikuchi et al., 2010;Dudek et al., 2017). However, this is a first comprehensivephytochemical analysis of a broad range of compounds fromdifferent parts of the plant. Significant differences were observedin the phytochemical profiles of different plant parts (Table 1 andFigure 1). In bark extracts, themajor compounds were as follows:syringin (14; Rt = 16.9min, m/z 417 [M-H+HCOOH]-),demethyloleuropein (28; Rt = 28.2min, m/z 525 [M-H]-),forsythoside B (31; Rt = 30.0min, m/z 755 [M-H]-), acteoside(36; Rt = 31.4min, m/z 623 [M-H]-) and oleuropein (46;Rt = 38.3min, m/z 539 [M-H]-). In fruit extracts, the majorcompounds were as follows: nuzhenide (38; Rt = 33.0min, m/z685 [M-H]-) and an oleonuezhenide isomer (55; Rt = 43.3min,m/z 1071 [M-H]-). In flower extracts, the major compoundswere as follows: caffeoylglucaric acid (5; Rt= 10.1min, m/z 371[M-H]-), quercetin rutinoside (32; Rt = 30.1min, m/z 609 [M-H]-), acteoside (36; Rt= 31.4min,m/z 623 [M-H]-), oleuropein(46; Rt = 38.3min, m/z 539 [M-H]-), oleoacteoside (49; Rt= 40.1min, m/z 1009 [M-H]-) and oleonuezhenide (60; Rt= 45.4min, m/z 1071 [M-H]-). In leaf extracts, the majorcompounds were as follows: secologanoside (16; Rt= 17.3min,m/z 389 [M-H]-), quercetin rutinoside (32; Rt= 30.1min, m/z609 [M-H]-), syringalactone B (34; Rt = 30.5min, m/z 525 [M-H]-), oleuropein (46; Rt = 38.3min, m/z 539 [M-H]-), 2''-epi-frameroside (53; Rt= 42.6min,m/z 601 [M-H]-), and ligstroside(54; Rt = 43.1min, m/z 523 [M-H]-). The phytochemicalprofiles of the infusions and ethanolic extracts were similar, andonly quantitative differences were observed.Effect of Bark, Fruit, Flower and LeafInfusions and Ethanolic Extracts ofS. vulgaris on the Pro-inflammatoryFunction of Stimulated NeutrophilsIn all concentrations of the tested extracts, no significantreduction in membrane integrity was observed in comparisonto the control using a propidium iodide assay (Figures 2A,B).Activation of neutrophils by f-MLP results in degranulation anda significant release of ROS compared to the untreated control(Figures 2C,D). Additionally, stimulation with LPS resulted ina significant release of proteinase MMP-9, chemokine IL-8, andcytokine TNF-a (Figure 3). Incubation of stimulated neutrophilswith extracts at concentration ranges of 25-100ug/mL resultedin a statistically significant and dose dependent reduction of ROSproduction by all extracts over all tested concentrations. Therewas no statistically significant difference between infusions andethanolic extracts (Figures 2C,D).All infusions and extracts were able to inhibit the releaseof IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 3A,B).
