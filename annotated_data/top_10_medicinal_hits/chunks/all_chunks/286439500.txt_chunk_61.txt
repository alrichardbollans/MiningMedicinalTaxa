The effect on TNF-a production/release was less pronounced and was staticallysignificant only at the highest concentration of 100ug/mLfor bark and leaf ethanolic extracts and the flower infusion(Figures 3C,D). MMP-9 release was inhibited the most by barkand fruit ethanolic extracts (Figures 3E,F). In general, ethanolicextracts were slightly more active than infusions, and flowerand leaf preparations were more active than bark and fruitpreparations. In a previous study, we isolated 29 compoundsthat were hydroxycinnamoyl and secoiridoid derivatives (Dudeket al., 2017) from the flower extract with moderate anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we performed a bioassay-guided isolation of active compounds from the leaf extract.Bioassay-Guided Isolation of ActiveCompounds From Leaf ExtractThe crude alcoholic leaf extract was fractionated using aDiaion HP-20 and eluted with a 5-step H2O-MeOH gradient(100:0 - 0:100) to obtain six main fractions (F1-F6) basedon their TLC and HPLC profiles. The activities of thefractions were evaluated based on IL-8 inhibition and TNF-a release. Only fraction F6 inhibited the IL-8 release at aconcentration of 50ug/mL in a statistically significant manner(p < 0.001). Interestingly, fraction F2 stimulated TNF-aproduction, while fractions F5 and F6 decreased the productionof this cytokine (Figure 4). Fraction 5 was rich in oleuropein.Fraction 6, which contained several compounds, was subjectto further fractionation on a Sephadex LH-20 with H2O-MeOH (50:50) and then preparative chromatography was usedto isolate the following seven compounds: 2''-epiframeroside(I), oleonuezhenide (II), oleuropein (III), ligstroside (IV),neooleuropein (V), hydroxyframoside (VI), and framoside (VII)(Figure 4). The structures of these compounds (Figure 5) wereconfirmed based on their 1H and 13C NMR spectra, whichwere compared with reference data (Fukuyama et al., 1987;Damtoft et al., 1992; Kuwajima et al., 1992; Tanahashi et al., 1992;Iossifova et al., 1998; Konno et al., 1998; Takenaka et al., 2002).Analysis of the extracted ion intensity for single compounds ineach extract confirmed that 2''-epiframeroside (I), oleuropein(III), ligstroside (IV), neooleuropein (V), hydroxyframoside(VI), and framoside (VII) were the major compounds presentin leaf extract. Only oleonuezhenide (II) was present in a higherconcentration in the flower extract (Figure 2S).Effect on Cytokine/Chemokine Production,MAP Kinases and NF-kB ActivationLipopolysaccharide stimulation of human neutrophils resultedin the induction of the production/release of chemokines IL-8 (neutrophil chemotactic factor) and MCP-1 (monocytechemoattractant protein 1) along with cytokine TNF-ain comparison to cells that were not stimulated. Isolatedcompounds I, II, V, VI, and VII were tested at concentrationsof 10, 25, and 50uM, and their activity was compared witholeuropein and ligstroside, the characteristic compounds ofthe Oleacea family that were also isolated from active fractionF6, and with the positive control clarithromycin, a macrolideantibiotic which has been shown to inhibit the pro-inflammatoryfunction of neutrophils. At all concentrations of the testedcompounds, no significant reduction in membrane integrityFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 349156Woz'niak et al.

Neooleuropein was the most activecompound toward inhibiting IL-8 secretion (Figure 6B); atconcentrations of 25 and 50uM, the release was reduced to50.2% (p < 0.001) and 31.4% (p < 0.001) in comparison withLPS-stimulated cells (100% of release), respectively. The effectof neooleuropein at 50uM was more significant than the effectsof 2''-epiframeroside (p < 0.001), oleonuezhenide (p < 0.001),ligstroside (p < 0.001), and oleuropein (p < 0.001) at thesame concentration. Framoside and neooleuropein were themost active in reduction of TNF-a release at all concentrationstested (Figure 6C). The effect of framoside at 50uM was moresignificant than the effect of 2''-epiframeroside (p < 0.001),oleonuezhenide (p < 0.001), and ligstroside (p < 0.001) at thesame concentration. Additionally, neooleuropein was statisticallymore active than the positive control clarithromycin (p < 0.05).All isolated compounds except oleonuezhenide significantlyinhibited the release of MCP-1 from stimulated neutrophils(Figure 6D). However, only neooleuropein was active at allconcentrations tested (Figure 6D). The effect of neooleuropeinat 10uM was more significant than the effects of framoside(p < 0.05) and hydroxyframoside (p < 0.05); at 25uM, theeffect was more significant than the effects of framoside (p <0.01), hydroxyframoside (p < 0.01) and oleonuezhenide (p <0.01), while at 50uM, the effect was more significant than theeffect of oleonuezhenide (p < 0.001) and the positive controlclarithromycin (p < 0.01) at the same concentration. In general,neooleuropein was as effective or more effective in comparisonwith oleuropein and clarithromycin in reducing the release ofpro-inflammatory agents.The molecular mechanism of the observed effect was relatedto MAP kinases and NF-kB activation. Lipopolysaccharidestimulation of human neutrophils resulted in the rapidphosphorylation of proteins, including p38 MAPK, p42/44extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), as well as the translocation of NF-kB-p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.

The inhibition of the translocation ofNF-kB-p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was observedmost significantly for oleuropein; however, the activity ofneooleuropein was evident but more modest (Figure 7B).DISCUSSIONS. vulgaris preparations have been traditionally used in Europe totreat several ailments connected with inflammation and, togetherwith Asian Syringa sp., appear to be an interesting source ofdiverse bioactive structures (Su et al., 2015). The aim of thepresent study was to investigate the effects of phytochemicallycharacterized (HPLC-DAD-MSn) extracts that have been usedin traditional medicine (infusions and ethanolic extracts) fromdifferent parts of the common lilac (bark, fruits, leaves, andflowers) on the pro-inflammatory functions of neutrophils andto isolate the most active compounds using bioassay-guidedfractionation. Finally, we focused on the activity and molecularmechanisms of action of the isolated compounds able to regulateneutrophil inflammation.For the first time, we provided a comprehensivephytochemical analysis of common lilac and a comparisonof different parts such as bark, fruit, flower, and leafinfusions/extracts (Table 1, Figure 1). We were able to identifyor partially identify 64 compounds, and we also demonstratedsignificant differences in the phytochemical profiles of differentparts of the plant (Figure 1).
