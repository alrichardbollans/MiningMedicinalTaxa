Nerkar (2007) claims that nature has provided a pharmacy which people have recognised and taken advantage of. Many Western pharmaceuticals have been developed from natural sources and the search for new drug leads has often taken scientists back to traditional herbal medicines (Harvey, 2008). Herbal medicines (HMs) are still commonly used in many cultures (Williamson, 2002); despite this, there is limited documented ethnopharmacological evidence of the use of HMs in the United Kingdom (UK). The use of HMs is believed to be increasing as people use HMs to replace or complement Conventional Western Medicines (CWM), and seek natural ways to supplement a healthy lifestyle (Newall et al., 1996; Mintel, 2009). There is a common misconception that HMs are natural and therefore safe and free from harmful effects (Vickers, 2000; Ipsos MORI, 2008); however, there remains a lack of clinical evidence to support the safety and efficacy of HMs. There could be risks associated with the simultaneous consumption of HMs with CWM such as herb-drug interactions and adverse effects. To ensure patients are getting the best pharmaceutical care, Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) need to recognise that their patients may be using HMs in addition to CWM (Shaw et al., 2012). HCPs need to have sufficient training and knowledge of HMs to help patients make informed decisions about their health (Newall et al., 1996). Sandhu and Heinrich (2005) note that, ''in the past decades a significant immigration from outside Europe has influenced European societies in a multitude of ways'' and observe that immigrants have brought their own culture, culinary skills, and traditional herbal remedies with them. The ethnic diversity in the UK means there is a great wealth of knowledge of HMs and variety of HMs which may be used. The increasing migration of people from the Indian subcontinent countries of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh (South Asia) to the UK has created large South Asian (SA) populations in the UK (Khunti et al., 2009). Results from the 2001 census revealed that SA ethnic minorities formed 3.9% of the UK population; this increased to over 5.3% in the 2011 census (Office for National Statistics, 2012). The SA ethnic group is itself very diverse and comprised of different cultures and religions all with their own interpretations of traditional herbal medicine; and little is known about the current use of HMs by SA populations in the UK. This presents a unique opportunity to explore the use of HMs by SA ethnic populations. 2 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The import and increased use of HMs in the UK has introduced concerns over the quality, safety, and regulation of HMs (Vassou et al., 2015); hence, reliable and efficient methods of identification are needed. DNA-based techniques have been developed to authenticate medicinal plants used in HMs. These methods can be used to identify the plant species and any potential substitutes or adulterants; a relatively new technique which will be explored further in this research. This chapter will give an overview to the rationale for this study; detailing the aims, objectives, and background information to this research. A brief overview of the structure of the thesis will explain how the project evolved. 1.2 Research Aims The aim of this research is to explore the knowledge and use of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian communities and healthcare professionals in the UK; followed by the collection of specific medicinal plants of interest, which can be genetically tested to confirm their identity, using DNA-based techniques. 1.3 Objectives 1. Explore the knowledge and use of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian diasporic communities, in the UK; describe where the knowledge originates from. 2. Obtain insight into UK based healthcare professionals' knowledge and opinions of herbal medicines. 3. Use DNA barcoding techniques for the identification of herbal medicines and medicinal plants used in South Asian communities. 1.4 Background to This Research In order to gain perspective on the origins and current use of HMs some background information is provided in this section. It explores the origins of traditional HMs, HMs as drug leads, the use of HMs, some potential problems associated with HMs (i.e. contamination and adulteration), and the regulation of HMs in India and Europe.
