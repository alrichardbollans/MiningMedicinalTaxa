Materials and methodsAccess to analogues of buprenorphine in which the t-butyl group is replaced by alternative bulky groups was by the standard procedure of Grignard addition to ketone.Binding affinities of the new compounds, plus various standards, were determined in CHO cells transfected with human receptor cDNA, as previously described (Spagno-lo et al., 2008); the displaced selective radioligands were [3H]DAMGO, [3H]Cl-DPDPE, [3H]U69593 and [3H]N/OFQ for binding to MOP, delta opioid (DOP), kappa opi-oid (KOP) and NOP receptors respectively. The ligands were assessed for functional activity in the [35S]GTPgS-binding assay in human receptor transfected CHO cells (Spagnolo et al., 2008).BU08028 has been evaluated in vivo for attenuation of acute pain, using the tail flick assay and these results will be presented. To characterize the pharmacological profile of BU08028 as an analgesic in rhesus monkeys, acute ther-mal nociception and capsaicin-induced thermal allodynia assays were conducted.Results and discussionOf the analogues of buprenorphine with variation in the C20 substituents BU08028 having t-pentylgroup,has a Ki of less than 10 nM at each receptor in the opioid recep-tor family, making it the first universally high affinity opi-oid ligand. More importantly, even though the structure is very similar to that of buprenorphine, its affinity at NOP re-ceptor is almost 10 fold higher than that of buprenorphine itself.In vitro functional activity, as determined by [35S]GTPgS binding, indicated that BU08028 has virtually no efficacy at delta and kappa receptors. At mu receptors, the functional activity is very similar to buprenorphine, with only 21% stimulation relative to DAMGO. At NOP recep-tors, the EC50 is 43.5 nM, approximately 6 times more po-tent than buprenorphine, and has significantly higher ef-S6 OP 253532Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 531 - 532 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencesficacy showing but it is far more efficacious, having 44% stimulationrelative to N/OFQ, ascompared to buprenor-phine which has stimulation in the range of 15%.In the tail flick assay BU08028produced a dose-dependent increase in antinociception through MOP receptor activation.Systemic administration of BU08028 (0.001-0.01 mg/kg) in rhesus monkeys, dose-dependently produced antino-ciception against acute thermal nociception and capsaicin-induced thermal allodynia. Compared to buprenorphine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), the antinociceptive effect of BU08028 was more potent and much longer-lasting (i.e., more than 24 hours). BU08028-induced antinociception was attenu-ated equally by both mu opioid (MOP) receptor antagonist naltrexone (0.03 mg/kg) and NOP antagonist J-113397 (0.1 mg/kg), indicating that BU08028 is a bifunctional MOP/NOP agonist in primates. When administered alone in dos-es up to 0.01 mg/kg, BU08028 did not induce itch scratch-ing, a standard side-effect of opioids such as buprenor-phine.More importantly, BU08028 at antinociceptive dos-es did not compromise physiological functions including respiration and cardiovascular activities measured by the radio-telemetric probes. Compared to MOP agonists, bu-prenorphine and remifentanil, BU08028 did not produce reinforcing effects in monkeys under the progressive-ratio schedule of drug self-administration.ConclusionWe have discovered BU08028, and other compounds, having binding affinity at MOP receptors similar to that of buprenorphine and, as desired, higher affinity and consid-erably higher efficacy than buprenorphine at NOP recep-tors. In measures of hyperalgesia, both in rodents (rats) and non-human primates (rhesus monkey) BU08028was a potent, long-acting anti-hyperalgesic with both MOP and NOP components to its activityin the absence of common side effects associated with MOP agonists in primates.This study strongly supports the therapeutic potential of ligands with mixed MOP/NOP actions as innovative analgesics in humans.BU08028 therefore represents a potential analge-sic agent, with low side effect profile.This work was supported by NIDA grants DA020469 (SMH), DOD/Army W81XWH-13-2-0045, US-PHS grants DA-035359 and DA-032568 (M-ChKo) and DA023281 (LToll).ReferencesCami-Kobeci, G., Polgar, W.

The core com-petences of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis are medicinal chemistry and innovative drug discovery with outstanding expertise in molecular modelling, organic syn-thesis, medicinal chemistry and preclinical drug develop-ment for the treatment of infections, cancer, cardiovascu-lar diseases, and neuronal disorders. During the last decade several new drug candidate molecules have been discov-ered in the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis. From meldonium to new cardioprotective drug methyl-GBB Meldonium (mildronate; 3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazini-um) propionate) is a clinically used cardiometabolic drug. The mechanism of action of the drug includes lowering the L-carnitine and its metabolite contents in body tissues through inhibition of enzyme g-butyrobetaine hydroxy-lase and organic cation/carnitine transporter type 2 protein (Dambrova et al, 2002; Dambrova et al., 2016). After investigation of molecular mechanisms of mel-donium, we started screening program which resulted in the discovery of a novel compound, 4-[ethyl(dimethyl)am-monio]butanoate (methyl-GBB) (Tars et al., 2014). Meth-yl-GBB treatment decreased the acylcarnitine contents and lead to cardioprotective effects by limiting long-chain fatty acid oxidation and facilitating glucose metabolism. In vivo pretreatment with methyl-GBB attenuated the infarct size and significantly improved 24 h survival of rats (Liepinsh et al., 2015). In apolipoprotein E knockout mice, methyl-GBB treatment reduced the size of atherosclerotic plaques (Vilskersts et al., 2015). In the experimental models of di-abetes methyl-GBB administration improved insulin sen-sitivity and reduced blood glucose levels (Liepinsh et al, 2016). These results provide evidence that the pharmaco-logical decreasing of the acylcarnitine content may repre-sent a novel treatment strategy for cardiovascular diseases.ConclusionThe Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis hosts the innovative synergy of academic achievements in organic chemistry and pharmacology with competent applied re-search in medicinal chemistry to drive smart drug discov-ery projects.Acknowledgements Supported by the Latvian State Research Program BIOMEDICINE.

The high degree of conservation of these enzymes among prokaryotes and eukaryotes indicates an essential role in cell biology. Because its structure is a dou-ble helix, DNA is under tortional stress that results in mul-tiplex twisting of the molecule. To be processed for repli-cation or gene expression, the supercoiled DNA must be-come accessible to nucleic acid polymerases or compo-nents of the transcription machinery. This change requires relaxation and untangling of the intertwined DNA strands, which are the typical tasks of Topo (Hande, 2003). In humans, two classes of Topo are well characterized, type I and type II. Topo type II (Topo II) are useful as drug target, since they have an indispensable function in cell bi-ology and they lack biological redundancy. Inhibitors of these enzymes have become central parts of both prima-ry and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens in neoplastic dis-eases, and they probably will remain so for the foresee-able future.Classical Topo II inhibiting agents such as epipodo-phyllotoxins or anthracyclines interfere with the break-age-reunion reaction of Topo II by stabilizing this cleav-able complex. The stabilization of the cleavable complex and not the inhibition of the Topo II activity is supposed to play the decisive role in the cytotoxic effect of the classical Topo II interacting agents. Accordingly, resistance against classical Topo II-inhibiting agents can result from any pro-cess that leads to an altered binding of Topo II to drugs or DNA and a reduced formation of cleavable complexes. In-deed, it was demonstrated that decreased Topo II catalytic activity can mediate drug resistance to cancer cells (Beck et al., 2001). Because of Topo II is the target for some of the most active anticancer drugs such as etoposide, teniposide, and doxorubicin used in the treatment of human malignancies, detailed investigations of bi- and ter-benzimidazole deriva-tives revealed that these compounds constitute a new class of Topo I and II inhibitors. Work on such compounds indi-cates that a fused ring system in the structure is critical for the activity.In the past years, we synthesized several derivatives of benzazoles, such as benzoxazoles, benzimidazoles, ben-zothiazoles, and oxazolo(4,5-b)pyridines as isosteric fused heterocyclic compounds to investigate their eukaryotic DNA Topo II inhibitory activity (Pinar et al. 2004) and re-alized their three dimentional quantitative structure activi-ty relationships (3D-QSAR) analysis by using comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (COMSIA) method (Tekiner-Gulbas et al., 2006).A training set of 37 compounds of benzazoles, which are possessing benzoxazole, benzimidazole, benzothia-zole, and oxazolo(4,5-b)pyridine fused heterocylic nucle-us at their structure, were tested for their eukaryotic DNA Topo II inhibitor activity in cell-free system by using relax-ation assay. The relaxation assay utilises supercoiled plas-mid as substrate and has been used by many investigators to study the catalytic activity of Topo I and II types. In-hibitory activities were presented as micromolar concen-trations of the compounds that cause 50% inhibition per unit of enzyme (IC50), under the assay conditions. From the plots obtained with three different concentrations of the drugs, IC50 values were obtained and the results are the averages of two to three estimations. If no inhibition was obtained at 100 uM, the drug was assumed to have no in-hibitory activity on eukaryotic DNA Topo II (Pinar et al., 2004).For the 3D-QSAR studies performed by using CoM-SIA methods running the SYBYL program package with S6 OP 255536Maced. pharm.
