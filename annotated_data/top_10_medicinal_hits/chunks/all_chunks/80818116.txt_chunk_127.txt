Initially TDM was employed for the old generation of AEDs such as carbamazepine, valproic acid, phenytoin, and primidone, which are characterized by complex and variable pharmacokinetics. On the other hand, benefit of TDM for the new generation of AEDs including lamotrig-ine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, stiripentol, tiagabine, le-vetiracetam, and zonisamide, is often questioned as they have more favourable pharmacokinetics, wider therapeutic range and better tolerability in terms of interaction and ad-verse effects profile (Patsalos et al., 2008). Therefore, sub-stantial research is needed to better document the value of TDM of the new AEDs in clinical practice. The aim of the present report was to provide evidence of the usage of pop-ulation pharmacokinetic models as extensions of the ther-apeutic drug monitoring in patients with epilepsy treated with lamotrigine (LTG) or oxcarbazepine (OXC). Materials and methodsTwo prospective clinical studies were conducted on patients with confirmed epilepsy on stable OXC or LTG therapy at the University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slo-venia. Both studies were approved by the National Medi-cal Ethics Committee of the Republic of Slovenia and were carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. At least two blood samples per patient were drawn, approx-imating trough and peak steady-state concentrations. Plas-ma concentrations of OXC and its main metabolite were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spec-trometry method, developed and validated for the study purposes. For LTG plasma concentration measurements an adapted HPLC method with UV detection was used. Pa-tients enrolled in LTG study were genotyped for metabo-lizing enzymes (UGT1A4 and UGT2B7) by real-time PCR genotyping using TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assays on the ABI 7500 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA) and for transporters (ABCB1 and SLC22A1) using a fluorescence-based competitive allele-specific (KASPar) assays according to the manufactur-er's instructions (KBiosciences, Herts, UK). The popula-tion pharmacokinetic analysis was performed employing a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach using NON-MEM software (ver. 7.3, Icon Development Solutions, Ell-icott City, MD, USA.) (Bauer, 2011).Results and discussionA total of 100 pharmacokinetic profiles from adult pa-tients on stable LTG therapy were available for pharma-cokinetic analysis. The structural model used was a one-S6 OP 249524Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 523 - 524 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencescompartment model with first order absorption and elimi-nation. With a base model, absorption rate (inter-individu-al variability) was estimated at 1.96 h-1 (72.8%), oral clear-ance at 2.32 L/h (41.4%) and distribution volume at 77.6 L (30.2%). Residual variability was most adequately de-scribed using a proportional error model and was estimat-ed at 19.8%. LTG clearance was associated with UGT2B7 genetic polymorphism, patient's weight, renal function, smoking and co-treatment with enzyme inducing or inhib-iting drugs. This study showed that there is a significant variability in LTG pharmacokinetics and therefore TDM can be useful in various clinical settings for therapy indi-vidualization.A total of 84 plasma concentration measurements of OXC and its active metabolite 10-monohydroxyoxcar-bazepine (MHD) from 18 pediatric patients (age 6 months-3years) with epilepsy on stable OXC therapy were includ-ed into the study. The structural model was comprised of two-compartment model for the parent drug and one com-partment model for the disposition of the active metabo-lite. The estimated parameters were absorption rate con-stant (Ka), volume of the central and peripheral compart-ment of the parent drug (V1OXC and V2OXC), elimination and distribution clearance of the parent drug (CLOXC and QOXC), and clearance and distribution volume of the me-tabolite (CLMHD and V1MHD). Estimated parameters (inter-individual variability) of the base model were Ka 0.581 h-1 (90.9%); CLOXC 33.7 L/h (41.4%); V1OXC 21.3 L (152%); V2OXC 3299 L; QOXC 26.4 L; CLMHD 0.128 L/h (26.4%); V1MHD 3.13 L. Model that include allometric scaling of the clearance and distribution volume parameters and matura-tion function on OXC and MHD clearance was adopted as the final model. Developed model provided new insights into the developmental aspects of OXC and MHD disposi-tion in pediatric patients. Future studies are needed to con-firm those findings and to evaluate the developed pharma-cokinetic model as a tool for therapy optimization.ConclusionPerformed clinical studies demonstrated that there is a considerable variability in LTG and OXC pharmacoki-netics and the application of therapeutic drug monitoring can be useful for therapy optimization in patients with ep-ilepsy. Identification and quantification of the sources of variability among patients is essential for individualization of drug therapy, and it can be accomplished by employing population pharmacokinetic approach. Therefore, pharma-cokinetic modeling can serve as valuable extension of ther-apeutic drug monitoring and can be used for therapy opti-mization and individualization in routine clinical practice significantly contributing to more rational pharmacothera-py of antiepileptic drugs.ReferencesBauer, R.J., 2011.

Pharmacogenetics (PGx) aims at identifying genes and genetic variants that affect the clinical outcome of ther-apy, i.e. determination of inherited genetic differences and genetic mechanisms that condition or disposition efficacy and toxicity of drugs (Jones 2013). PGx prediction of the therapeutic outcome in each patient individually, is a chal-lenge and it's usage in clinical practice is still far from re-ality. The extensive research efforts undertaken over the past decade have identified several genetic markers that are strongly associated with outcomes of interest. Appraising the drug related function of CYP450 (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5 and AKR1D1) genetic variants is the core for efficient modeling of population specific, cost-ef-fective, PGx platform for individualization of drug thera-py (Cabaleiro et al., 2015; Holmes et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2015; Kapedanovska Nestorovska et al., 2014; Lopez-Ro-driguez et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2014; Rejon-Parrilla et al., 2014) . The objective of this study is to determine the differen-tial expression of polymorphic CYP450 genes and the cor-relation of mRNA levels in the liver and peripheral blood, to evaluate the clinical validity of the CYP450 phenotype in prediction of pharmacokinetic properties and therapeu-tic outcome of substrate drugs (CYP2D6 for risperidone, CYP2C19 for clopidogrel and CYP2C9 for ibuprofen) and to assess cost-effectiveness of PGx platform for individ-ualized treatment with risperidone and clopidogrel in our country. Materials and methodsThe studies included a total of 482 subjects, of which 230 healthy volunteers and 252 patients. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms is determined by using the Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction while the rel-ative mRNA level of the CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP3A5 and AKR1D1 genes, in the liver and peripheral blood, was determined by the method of qRT-PCR. Plas-ma and urinary concentrations of risperidone and 9-OH ris-peridon as well as of ibuprofen in healthy volunteers and patients with psychiatric disorders are determined using a validated HPLC-MS / MS and HPLC. Decision tree mod-el, including only direct drug related costs was used to evaluate the economic viability of the PGx application in individualization of Rispiridone and Clopidrogel therapy in our country. Results and discussionAccording to the results, the relative CYP450 mRNA levels and the degree of their mutual correlation in liver and peripheral blood indicate tissue specific, sexually di-morphic, cis /trans regulated gene expression and activi-ty. The CYP3A5 gene expression in blood can be used as a biomarker to study the physiological and pathological vari-ations of CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and AKR1D1 en-zymes. Association of CYP450 allele variants with drug pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome, (CYP2D6 for risperidone, CYP2C9 for ibuprofen and CYP2C19 for clopidogrel), confirm the genetic basis of variability in drug response in patients from R. Macedonia. Risperidone metabolic ratio is a useful therapeutic biomarker to rec-ommend CYP2D6 genetic testing to guide the present or future treatment of patients.The PGx defined Risperidone dose strategy (assuming 99% test accuracy) was associ-S6 OP 250526Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 525 - 526 (2016)Oral presentationsClinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular Sciencesated with EUR7.6 /month/patient increase in total treatment cost and health gain of 0,11 QALY, yielding an ICER of EUR69.32/ QALY, compared to the traditional approach. Re-duced PGx test accuracy (95% and 50%) augmented the ICER (EUR610.73/QALY and EUR2300.22/QALY, respectively), due to the EUR30.53/ month increase in the treatment for each incorrect genotyped patient. Total accumulated cost per pa-tient for the PGx guided clopidogrel therapy was EUR99.049 versus EUR 107.62 for the traditional treatment strategy while the mean drug-associated cost was e EUR21.09 and EUR9.68, re-spectively. The cost associated with and due to side events hospitalization was 1.5-fold less in PGx compared to the traditional treatment. Economic assessment of genetic screening testing for mutations that affect the level of ex-pression and functional activity of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes justifies the application of PGx individualized treat-ment with risperidone and clopidogrel in our country. ConclusionThe established association between the examined ge-netic variations, drug pharmacokinetics, clinically signifi-cant patient outcomes as well as the obtained pharmaco-economic evidence, highlighte the opportunities of imple-menting PGx guided drug treatment in R.
