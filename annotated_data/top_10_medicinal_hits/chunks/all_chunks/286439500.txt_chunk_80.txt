The conversion generates superoxideanion that may contribute to ROS-dependent induction ofapoptosis (Liu et al., 2006; Phang et al., 2008a,b). Severalstudies established the function of PRODH/POX as a tumorsuppressor gene. Therefore, the inhibition of its activity iscorrelated with a cancer progression. In several cancer cells, ascancer of kidney or cancers of digestive tract, the expressionof PRODH/POX is very low or not detected (Phang and Liu,2012).Proline can be also synthesized either from ornithine byornithine aminotransferase (OAT) or from glutamic acid byP5C synthase, then P5C might be converted to proline by P5Creductase (PYCR), leading to increase in proline concentration.These pathways are therefore considered in studied on proline-dependent responses of cancer cells.The squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the mostfrequent cancers of the oral cavity cancer [oral squamouscell carcinoma (OSCC)]. It is characterized as highly invasivewith the ability to give early and extensive lymph nodesmetastases (Carvalho et al., 2004). The cancer treatment isprimarily focused on the resection of a tumor. Afterward,the radiotherapy and the chemotherapy are followed. Upto date, therapeutic protocols do not offer to the patientswith advanced SCC, effective therapeutic options. Thelack of any advanced alternative pharmacotherapy of SCCis a problem of modern medicine (Pilch and Bouquot,2005).Several studies revealed the connection between theoverexpression of oral cancer overexpressed 1 protein(ORAOV1) and the occurrence of more aggressive tumorsin esophagus (Zhai et al., 2014). Additionally, ORAOV-1-overexpressed cell lines, among others CAL-27 cell line, aremarked with a higher intracellular proline concentration andstronger resistance on treatment (Jiang et al., 2008, 2010). Itwas confirmed that ORAOV1 influences PYCR activity. Hence,the increase in intracellular proline level was observed andconsequently the promotion of tumor progression (Togashiet al., 2014). Hence, the effect of chosen polyphenols on prolinemetabolism may be a relevant issue in the apoptosis induction(Phang et al., 2012).The purpose of the study was to identify mechanisms ofcytotoxic activity of selected propolis components consideringtheir effect on the proline metabolism in CAL-27 cell line.Previous analysis of the commercially available, standardizedpreparations of propolis allowed to identify a few of the mostabundant polyphenols as chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid,and ferulic acid (Maciejewicz et al., 2001; Markiewicz-Z.ukowskaet al., 2012; Czyz.ewska et al., 2015, 2016). The study revealedthe proapoptotic effect of these compounds on CAL-27 cell line(Czyz.ewska et al., 2016), however, its molecular mechanism stillremains unclear. In this report, we present their effect on theapoptosis in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (CAL-27) and themechanism of the activity.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureThe studies were performed on tongue squamous cell line (CAL-27). The cell line was purchased in ATCC (CRL-2095 TM,American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, United States).Cell culture was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle'smedium (Gibco, United States) with 10% fetal bovine serum(FBS) (Gibco, United States) and 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 ug/mLstreptomycin (Gibco, United States) and incubated at 37*C in5% CO2.Polyphenols SolutionsChrysin was purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany),p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid were purchasedfrom Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).

The final concentration of DMSOdid not exceed 0.1% in each well. The tested polyphenolswere used at the following concentrations: chrysin - 5, 25,50, 80 ug/mL; ferulic acid - 50, 100, 150 ug/mL, caffeicacid - 65, 130, 190 ug/mL; and p-coumaric acid - 70, 140,210 ug/mL. The concentrations correspond to the followingmolar concentrations: chrysin - 0.020, 0.098, 0.216, 0.315 mM;caffeic acid - 0.361, 0.722, 1.055 mM; ferulic acid - 0.257, 0.515,0.772 mM; and p-coumaric acid - 0.426, 0.853, 1.279 mM.Cisplatin (CDDP) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) (10 uM) was usedas a positive control. The selection of polyphenols concentrationwas made on the grounds of previously received data (Czyz.ewskaet al., 2016). Then followed the incubation for 24 h, then theliquid was removed and cells were washed with PBS. Afterward,50 uL of MTT solution (1.0 mg of MTT per 1 mL of PBS)was added to each well and incubated for 1 h. To dissolveformazan derivatives dimethyl sulfoxide was added after MTTsolution removing. The absorbance was measured at 570 nmwavelength using an Asys UVN 340 microplate reader (Biogenet,Jozefow, Poland). For the treated cells, amount of viable cells wasexpressed as the percentage of control.Proliferation AssayThe proliferation of studied cells was evaluated as [methyl-3H]thymidine (Hartman Analytic GmbH, Braunschweig,Germany) incorporation into DNA of cells treated with studiedpolyphenols. In 24-well tissue culture dishes, cells were platedat 1 x 105 cells/well, using 1 mL of growth medium in eachwell. Various concentrations of polyphenols were added to theculture wells. Cisplatin (10 uM) was used as a positive control.After incubation for 24 h at 37*C, 0.5 uCi/mL of [methyl-3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol) was added to the wells and cultureswere incubated at 37*C for 4 h.

The equal amounts of cellsupernatants (15 ug of protein) were analyzed. Semi-dryelectrotransfer was performed after electrophoresis. For thisprocedure, Multiphor II Electrophoresis System Multiphor (GEHealthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Sweden) was used. Subsequently,the sequence of incubation with primary and secondaryantibodies and were performed. Afterward, membranes wereincubated with Amersham ECL Western Blotting DetectionReagent (GE Healthcare Life Science, United Kingdom), andchemiluminescence was analyzed with BioSpectrum ImagingSystem UVP (UltraViolet Products, Ltd., United Kingdom). Thedensitometry of bands was quantified by ImageJ software.Intracellular Proline ConcentrationAfter 24 h incubation with chosen polyphenols, cells werescratched and suspended in a cold mixture of water and methanol(v/v 80:20). After then a cycle of frost and defrost followed.Lastly, the cell solution was sonicated and preserved at -80*Cuntil further analysis. The used method allowed to determineintracellular concentration of proline and to compare treated cellswith untreated ones.The intracellular level of proline was determined using HPLCsystem (Agilent Technologies, Germany) connected to QTOFmass spectrometry detector (Agilent Technologies, Germany).Electrospray ionization (ESI) was used as an ion source. Theanalysis was performed on a HILIC column (Luna HILIC,Phenomenex, United States). Samples were injected in a volumeof 2 uL. The procedure required maintenance at 40*C. Thesystem was operated in both positive and negative mode atflow rate 1 mL/min with solvent A - water with 10 mMammonium formate, and solvent B - acetonitrile/water (9:1,v:v) with 10 mM ammonium formate. A mobile phase was asfollows: 100% B during 1.5 min in isocratic mode, at 1.5 minthe gradient mode started from 100% B to 70% B in 5.5 min,then 40% B in 6.0 min, maintained 40% B during 1 minand returned to starting conditions in 0.5 min, keeping there-equilibration until 10 min. The detector operated in fullscan mode. During analyses, reference masses were deliveredcontinuously to obtain accurate mass measurements. Referencemasses were at m/z 121.0509 (protonated purine) and m/z922.0098 [HP-921]. Compound identification was performedmonitoring monoisotopic ions of proline and the internalstandard (Proline-d3, #791261, Sigma-Aldrich, United States).The concentration range of proline to which calibration curvewas registered was as followed: 6.32-101.12 [uM].

Obtained concentrations werenormalized to the internal standard and to the amount of proteinin a sample.Vitality AssayVitality assay describes changes in the intracellular level of(reduced) thiols such as glutathione which exists in twoforms: reduced - GSH and - oxidized state (GSSG). Thedecrease in GSH levels is an early signal of cell death causedeither by the direct GSH oxidation promoted by radicals orFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 336206fphar-09-00336 April 3, 2018 Time: 17:22 # 4Celin'ska-Janowicz et al. Propolis Polyphenols Induce PRODH/POX-Dependent Apoptosisby the export of GSH through an ATP-dependent plasmamembrane transport system. The assay was performed usingNucleoCounter R(c) NC-3000TM system (ChemoMetec, Denmark)according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells incubated withstudied concentrations of polyphenols were detached from theplates, washed and stained with Solution 5 (containing threevarious reagents: VitaBright-48, propidium iodide, and acridineorange). Cisplatin (10 uM) was used as a positive control.Thereafter, the intensity of fluorescence was measured usingNucleoCounter R(c) NC-3000TM.Determination of Prolidase ActivityThe activity of prolidase was determined according to themethod of Myara et al. (1982). It is colorimetric assayusing Chinard's reagent. To perform the assay cells weredetached and scraped off using Cell Lysis Buffer (CellSignaling, United States). N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-L-proline (Cbz-Pro) (Bachem, United States) (5 mM) was used as a positivecontrol. Then samples were sonicated for 3 s x 10 s at 0*Cand then centrifuged at 16000 x g for 15 min. Afterward, thecell pellet was discarded. Supernatants were used for proteindetermination according to Lowry method and evaluation ofprolidase activity. The activation of prolidase requires incubationof cell extract supernatant with Mn (II), due to this factthe 100 uL of each sample was mixed with 100 uL of50 mM HEPES (pH 7.8) containing MnCl2 to achieve thefinal concentration 1 mM of MnCl2. Incubation lasts for 24 hat 37*C then the prolidase reaction was initiated by adding100 uL of the activation mixture which was 94 mM glycyl-proline(Gly-Pro). After adding of Gly-Pro samples were incubatedfor 1 h at 37*C. The reaction was terminated by addition1 mL of 0.45 M trichloroacetic acid. Parallel blank tubescontained trichloroacetic acid was added at time "zero." Afterthe samples centrifugation (10.000 x g for 15 min) the amountof released proline was determined by adding trichloroaceticacid/supernatant to the mixture of glacial acetic acid: Chinard'sreagent. Then followed incubation for 10 min at 90*C. Thedetermination of proline was based on the measurement ofabsorbance at 515 nm. Prolidase activity was expressed asnanomoles of proline released per minute per milligram ofprotein.Collagen BiosynthesisCollagen biosynthesis was measured as the incorporation ofradioactive proline into proteins. CAL-27 were incubated withvarious concentrations of polyphenols and with the 5 uCi/mLof 5[3H]-proline (Hartman Analytic GmbH, Germany) for24 h. 2-Metoxyestradiol (MOE) (Sigma-Aldrich, United States)(10 uM) was used as a positive control.
