N. GetovMedical University - Sofia, Faculty of PharmacyintroDuctionIn 2001 Bill Gates called this new decade "The Digital Decade" and thisis a fact now. Online technologies and applications have enabledconsumers to communicate their personal experiences with companies'products and services to other consumers. Increased internet usageover the last years is clear sign that Pharma industry has to evolve.Improving public perception and exploring other communicationavenues is necessary if Pharma is to keep in touch with its customerbase.aimThe purpose of this study is to outline trends and the new routes toapproach doctors and patients by the pharmaceutical industry.material anD methoDsThe data is Delphi method to evaluate publications for the period2005-2011 on the topic of "Internet pharmaceutical market" and "e-Marketing". We also reviewed available related articles in Internet andanalyzed more than 70 studies, articles and scientific publication.The data and conclusions are included in the study.resultsOver the last 15 years Internet users has grown from 16 million (0.4%of the population) to 1.966 billion (29% of the total population).In 2009consumers spend 34% of their media time online. As a result, digitalmarketing spending has gone from $6.2 billion in 1999 to$25.6 billion,or 12% of all marketing costs in 2009.As health is one of the mostsearched topics in Internet, physicians have to keep up with the evermore informed patients. In US 86% of physicians use the Internet togather health, medical or prescription drug information. The share ofphysicians who use the Internet for health information is 92%. Mainpart of medical doctors access Internet from their office. Anotherpopular way of collecting professional information is by online videos.Nearly half of online active physicians in Western Europe watch onlinevideo for professional purposes, jumping from only 28% in 2006 to 46%in 2009.DiscussionPhysician's use of the Internet continues to surge. The Internet isreinventing medicine, healthcare delivery and physiciancommunication. This trend is a clear sign that Internet should be amajor pillar in the future marketing campaigns of any pharmaceuticalcompany. The target audience - physicians and patients are alreadythere, searching for information and ensure additional promotionalchannel for the marketers. Most of the pharmaceutical companiescame relatively late on the internet, but the last few years, show thatthis is changing, although not as fast as in other industries. AWashington Post article of June 16, 2009 reported that an increasingnumber of pharmaceutical companies are turning to social mediatools, such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and MySpace, to markettheir products. The pharmaceutical industry spent more than $1billion on Internet ads in 2008 and is projected to spend $1.7 billion onsuch marketing efforts in 2012, according to the Direct MarketingAssociation. The top 10 drug companies using social media are Pfizer,Johnson and Johnson, Novartis, Boehringer Ingelheim, AstraZenecaUS, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Aventis, Roche and Merck.conclusionThe online marketing is becoming an integral component of marketingstrategies for most big Pharma companies. Knowledge and insightsgained from on-line communication with physicians and patientscould be valuable for feedback and customer loyalty assessment. E-Marketing for pharmaceuticals is an area where national regulatorsare a few steps behind. The actual legislation and requirements arestill to be defined.referencesInternet growth statistics (2011) http://www.allaboutmarketresearch. com/ internet.htmWhat you can learn from consumers' digital decade, J.Bernoff,2009 http://forrester.typepad.com/groundswell/2009/12/what-you-can-learn-from-consumers-digital-ecade.htmleHealth for the Pharmaceutical Industry BFHC0747/Published 01/200786% of physicians use Internet to access health information, P.L.Dolan,2010http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2010/01/04/bisc0104.htmWebinar Deck, Connecting with Physicians Online http://www.fdasm.com/docs/Connecting%20with%20Physicians%20Online%20Webinar%20Deck--%20final.pdfReaching Doctors and Patients Through New Digital Media DMHC2368Google Trends (2007).

Target blood pressure (BP) value in patients with DMII is <130/80 mm Hg. The aim of this research was to investigate BPcontrol in patients with DM II, and the presense of risk factors thatmight affect the increase in BP such as smoking, body weight and in-creased lipid levels.methoDologyIn the research performed in Pharmacy ''Sabac'', 140 patients with DMII were randomly selected. Data was collected about drugs use and riskfactors for hypertension, as well as demographic data. BP was mea-sured and documented.resultsAverage age of patients was 65 years (24-84). Average systolic BP was146 mm Hg (100-200 mm Hg). Average diastolic BP was 87 mm Hg (70-120 mm Hg). Only 27,14% of patients achieved adequate control ofBP with prescribed therapy. 1,43% of patients did not have hyperten-sion. 5,72% of patients were without antihypertensive therapy alt-hough they had increased BP. 75,71% of patients had one risk factorthat significantly affected the increase in BP, 7,86% had 3 risk factors.18,57% were smokers, 49,26% were overweight and 50,71% had in-creased lipid levels. 30,44% had one drug in the treatment, 31,88% twodrugs and 37,68% three or more drugs.conclusionOur results indicate that overall, patients with DM II do not have sa-tisfactory BP control. The majority of patients had at least one riskfactor which could have contributed to the poor BP control. Moreover,the reasons for poor BP control may be inadequacy of treatmentand/or poor compliance. Since BP control is essential for lowering themortality rate of patients with DM II, they may benefit from pharma-cist-provided education on smoking cessation, body-weight and lipidlevel lowering. Moreover, understanding the influence of risk factorsand the need for BP control may influence patient's compliance totreatment. Therefore, pharmacists should pay particular attention tothe education of patients with DM II about BP control.referencesNational clinical practice guidelines for diabetes.2002.National clinical practise guidelines for arterial hypertension.2005.rational antibiotic therapy:what Do our patients know?Milica Pesic1, Roland Antonic2, Gorana Krstic1,Gordana Stanisavljevic1, Snezana Mitic11Community Pharmacy ,,Vranje", Vranje, Serbia2Community Pharmacy ,,Sabac", Sabac, SerbiaintroDuction anD aimIrrational use of antibiotics leads to the development of multi-resistant strains of bacteria and is a serious problem of globalimportance. The aim of this research was to examine how well patientsare informed about the importance of rational use of antibiotics.methoDologyIn the research performed at the Pharmacy ,,Vranje", and ,,Sabac" 103patients aged 19 to 72 were randomly selected. Data was collected byanswering a questionnaire.results77.7% of respondents use antibiotics without a doctor'srecommendation. 26.2% of them think that there is no need to go tothe doctor because they know which antibiotic will help them forcertain symptoms, while 73.8% take antibiotics self-initiatively whenthere is no time to go to the doctor. 72.5% of respondents useantibiotics without a doctor's recommendation less than 3 times ayear, 7.5% 3 to 5 times, 5% more than 5 times a year, 15% wheneverthey think it is necessary.3.9% of total number of respondents think that self-initiative usageof antibiotics is harmless, 64.1% that it represents danger to theindividual who uses antibiotics without recommendation and 17.5%know that irrational use of antibiotics is a threat to the whole society.17.5% of respondents think that the antibiotic that has helped thembefore would be as effective in any further cases when the samesymptoms occur.72.8% of respondents obey the recommended dosage regimen ofantibiotics, while 10.7% know that they should be compliant with thedosing regimen, although it isn't always the case.75.7% use antibiotics for as long as the doctor has advised them, while2,9% use antibiotics until they feel better and then they stop thetreatment.1.9% do not comply with physician's advice.conclusionPatients' knowledge about rational use of antibiotics is not satisfac-tory. They are not aware of the importance of respecting dose regimenand duration of antibiotic therapy for therapeutic results andpreventing development of resistant strains of bacteria. Pharmacistsas the most available health workers should take an active role ineducating patients about this health issue of global importance.referencesSelection and use of antibiotics in general practice / (Compiled by Task Forceforguide, leader Slobodan Jankovic). - 1 ed. - Belgrade: Medical Faculty; University ofBelgrade, CIBID, 2004121fifth congress of pharmacy of maceDonia with international participationMacedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011PHARMACOECONOMY / SOCIAL PHARMACY/ PHARMACOINFORMATICS poster presentationsiDentification of meDical neeDsfrom primary health care Databasesin albaniaN. Kellici1, M. Fida1, A. Dibra2, M. Miraci2, S. Kellici21Primary Health Care Service, Tirana, Albania2University of Tirana, Faculty of Medicine, Tirana, AlbaniaintroDuctionThe primary health care system in Albania started its reform since1991, date of the political system change. During all these years oflong and difficult transition this system performed a continuousmodification and actually we can say that it reached some stability.The primary health care unit nr 8 in Tirana offers health service todayto 59224 patients. Year by year the number of insured people isgrowing and their need for health services is changing, too. Thisimplies the need for performance improvement of the primary healthcare system.objectivesWe tried to investigate the trend of the patients' needs for health careservices based on our databases and our experience of the last 4 yearsof work.methoDsWe searched through our databases of the last four years and foundthe number of patients receiving health services, what kind of servicethey need, which are the pathologic changes in these years etc.resultsBy 59224 patients registered at primary health care unit nr. 8, 8592are patients suffering of chronic diseases and are in treatment forthese diseases.We noticed that year by year there is a significantly risisng in thenumber of chronic disesaes treated compared to the number of acuteconditions treated.The number of patients that requested health care service at ourcenter increased slowly each of these four years from 96651 visits in2007 to 118302 visits in 2010. This increase in the number of medicalvisits is not only dedicated to the greater number of registeredpatients, but espetially to the raise of awareness among patientsrelated to their medical needs. By this point of view we can say thatthe number of meetings of every single patients with his/her doctorwas increased significantly.The specialistic meetings increased as well especially these ofcardiology, laboratory tests, gynecology ecc. The most influencedamong the specialistic meetings was the number of cardiologicmeetings with an increase from 4060 visits in 2007 to 5619 visits in2010. The laboratory tests were increaed from 3900 tests in 2007 at7310 tests in 2010. There is a stability in the pediatric number of visitsin these years.conclusionsThere is an increased tendency of the Albanian patients to benefitfrom the primary health care services. The insured persons are risingin number and this is due to many factors: health care reform, moremedical needs, raising awareness on health care issues etc.The pathological spectrum is in continuous change due to a changedlife style, to the increase of the average age etc. Patients are moreoriented now to the laboratory findings than they were four years ago.The continuous monitoring of the number of patients, number ofmedical visits, type of visits (thus type of medical needs) will absolutelyhelp us to better understand the health status of our community andto better explain the factors that might have any eventual impact onit. For sure we must further investigate many other factors that caninfluence the health status of our patients (life style, smoke, ambientcontamination etc. ).These findings will help us and the health care decision makers tobetter orient the health education strategies and health promotioninterventions.referencesAlvaro Zerda et al; Health insurance systems and access to medicines; WashingtonD.C.
