Frankincense extract has been found toexhibit efficacy against gingivitis. A double blinded randomizedplacebo controlled trial was conducted among 75 female patientsaged between 15 and 18 years with moderate plaque-inducedgingivitis. Six groups were randomly formed based on theadministration of 0.1 g of frankincense extract, 0.2 g of itspowder, placebo, and whether the patients have undergonescaling and root planning (SRP) or not. Gingival index, plaqueindex, bleeding index, and probing pocket depth were measuredon the 0, 7th, and 14th days of the study. Detailed analysisof the data revealed that SRP along with the application ofFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 68665Kunnumakkara et al. Googling the Guggulfrankincense extract or powder might cause significant decreasein inflammatory indices in comparison to the groups withoutdrug therapy and SRP (Khosravi Samani et al., 2011).Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseDifferent clinical studies with guggul have shown its efficacyagainst IBDs which include colitis and Crohn's disease. Forinstance, the gum resin of B. serrata was found to be effectivein the treatment of chronic colitis with minimal side effects ina clinical study conducted by Gupta et al. In this study, thepatients with chronic colitis were treated with gum resin fromB. serrata at a dose of 900mg daily divided in three dosesfor 6 weeks. The treatment resulted in the improvement ofstool properties, hemoglobin, serum iron, calcium, phosphorus,proteins, total leukocytes, and eosinophils in the patients(Gupta et al., 2001). Further, a double-blind, placebo-controlled,randomized, parallel study on 82 patients with Crohn's diseasewas conducted where patients were given a new B. serrataextract; Boswelan. In this trial, remission was observed in 59.9%of the actively treated patients. Additionally, this study alsoconfirmed better tolerability of Boswelan in long-term treatmentof Crohn's disease (Holtmeier et al., 2011). Furthermore,leukotrienes play an important role in inflammation of thecolon in ulcerative colitis. Sallai guggul gum resin is knownto be specific, non-redox, and non-competitive inhibitors of5-LOX, a crucial enzyme of leukotriene biosynthesis. Patientswith grade II and III ulcerative colitis were treated with B.serrata gum resin at a dose of 350mg thrice daily for 6 weeks.Stool properties, histopathology, and scan microscopy of rectalbiopsies, blood parameters including hemoglobin, serum iron,calcium, phosphorus, proteins, total leukocytes, and eosinophilsshowed slightly better improvement in Boswellia treated patients(Gupta et al., 1997).Nodulocystic AcneGuggulipid is considered to be very effective in topical and oralcomplementary as well as an alternative medicine (CAM) forthe treatment of acne (Magin et al., 2006). In a clinical studyconducted by Thappa andDogra, patients with nodulocystic acnewere given guggulipid equivalent to 25mg GS for 3 months,which resulted in progressive reduction in lesions in majorityof patients. However, patients with oily faces displayed betterresponse to guggulipid (Thappa and Dogra, 1994).Thus, these clinical studies well evince the potential effectof Commiphora and Boswellia on different chronic diseases.However, more studies are inevitable to establish them as cuttingedge strategy for the treatment of diverse human diseases.CONCLUSIONSince ancient times, Commiphora and Boswellia are consideredas important traditional medicinal plants which are used for thetreatment of various ailments. Guggul isolated fromCommiphoraand Boswellia have immense therapeutic potential against severaldiseases and it has been well established by numerous in vitro,in vivo, and clinical studies. Guggul was used traditionallyfor the treatment of inflammation and hyperlipidemia, butwith the extensive studies on guggul and associated molecularmechanisms unveiled newer insights of its use for the treatmentof various other chronic diseases as well. Gum resin guggulpossesses multiple pharmacological activities especiallyhypolipidemic, antiobesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoreffects, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective,thyroid stimulatory effects etc. It effectively regulates differenttranscription factors, enzymes, cytokines, and anti-apoptoticproteins which are involved in inflammation, carcinogenesis, andother chronic diseases. Further, Commiphora in combinationwith other ayurvedic herbs is commercially available andmarketed for the treatment and cure of arthritis, obesity andassociated side effects of the disease. Many patents are alsofiled and approved to use guggul as a constituent of polyherbalformulations and cosmetics. Therefore, taking the medicinalimportance and commercial use of guggul into consideration,it can be advocated to possess substantial therapeutic potentialagainst diverse chronic disorders. However, more in vitro, invivo, and well-designed clinical studies are required to validatethe clinical usefulness of guggul and to obtain a potent herbalderived drug with enhanced efficacy, minimal side effects andstrong disease combating properties.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSBA and AK contributed to study design and writing of themanuscript.
