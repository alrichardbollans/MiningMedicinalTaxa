Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are an improved generation of lipid carriers that are pre-ferred over conventional lipid formulations and solid lip-id nanoparticles due to their enhanced properties for drug loading, modulation of the drug release profile and im-proved physical stability (Alam et al., 2015). Additional-ly, the small size, unique drug incorporation abilities, ste-ric propertiesand possibilities for surface modification of NLCs favour brain targeting and delivery.The presented study focuses on the formulation opti-misation of surface stabilised RPD loaded NLCs and their characterisation in terms of particle size, particle size dis-tribution and drug encapsulation efficiency.Materials and methodsMaterialsCutina(r) GMS V PH (GMS) was kindly donated by Cognis, Germany. Miglyol 812 and Phospholipon 90G (Ph 90G) were purchased from Sasol, Germany and Lipoid, Germany, respectively. Sodium glycocholate (SGH) and Tween 80 were obtained from NutriScience Innovations, LLC, USA and Merck, Germany, respectively. Poloxam-er 407, Poloxamer 188 and PEG 6000 were a generous gift from BASF, Germany. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Risperidone (RPD) was purchased from Teva-Tech, Israel. All the oth-er chemicals and reagents were of the highest purity grade commercially available and used as received.Preparation of NLCsDifferent formulations of blank NLCs were prepared using melt emulsification and rotor-stator homogenisation technique. Optimised formulation (sample 1) (central com-posite design: blocked cube star) composed of 2.5% GMS, 2.5% Miglyol812, 0.75% Ph 90G and 0.2% SGH was se-lected by minimising both responses, mean particle diame-ter (D50) and particle size distribution expressed in terms of SPAN factor. Briefly, the lipid phase was melted by heat-ing to ~80 degC and dispersed in an aqueous phase containing SGH, preheated at the same temperature, under high shear homogenisation (7 min, 24.000 rpm) using Ultra-Turrax(r) T25 (Ika-Werke, Germany). Subsequently, the dispersion was allowed to recrystallize at 5 degC for 1 h. In order to turn the hydrophobic NLC surface into a more hydrophilic one, sample 1 was further modified by incorporating different concentrations (4.0, 4.5, 5.0 and S8 OP 305640Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 639 - 640 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent session5.5% w/w) of Tween 80 (samples 1A1-4), Poloxamer 407 (sample 1B1-4), Poloxamer 188 (sample 1C1-4) or PEG 6000 (sample 1D1-4) in the aqueous phase, prior to the high-shear homogenisation. Sample 1A4, prepared with 5.5% Tween 80 was selected for preparation of RPD load-ed NLCs, based on the results obtained from in vitro pro-tein adsorption studies. Drug loaded NLCs were prepared using the same procedure as described above, by adding different concentrations of RPD (drug/lipid mass ratio 1, 10 and 20%; samples R1, R10 and R20, respectively) to the melted lipid phase prior to the high-shear homogenisation.Characterisation of NLCsThe objective of the protein adsorption studies was to determine the amount of adsorbed BSA on the surface of NLCs prepared with different types and concentrations of stabilisers. Briefly, 100 ul aliquots of the prepared sam-pleswere incubated with 2mg of BSA in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH=7.4) for 1 h on shaking water bath (37 degC, 75 rpm). After adsorption, the unbound protein was sepa-rated by centrifugal ultrafiltration through three washing cy-cles using Vivaspin 20, 1000 KDa (15 min, 4000 rpm; Het-tich, Rotofix 32, Germany). Afterwards, the volume of sam-ples was condensed to the initial volume of NLC dispersions. The adsorbed amount of BSA/mg lipid was calculated indi-rectly by determining the total amount of protein remaining in the filtrate by UV spectroscopy (595 nm; Bio-Rad's Mod-el 3550-UV Microplate Reader) after reaction with Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, USA), based on the method of Brad-ford (microtiter plate protocol) and subsequent subtraction from the initial BSA amount. The particle size (D50) and par-ticle size distribution (SPAN) of the prepared NLCs were de-termined by laser diffractometry (Mastersizer 2000, Hydro 2000S, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). In order to determine the drug content (mg RPD/g lipid) and encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of RPD in the NLCs, the particles in the suspension were separated by centrifugal ultrafiltration through three washing cycles using Vivaspin 20, 1000 KDa (15 min, 4000 rpm; Hettich, Rotofix 32, Ger-many) and brake-opened using methanol. The solution was then passed through a 0.45 um filter and analysed by re-verse-phased HPLC method (Agilent HPLC system, 1200 Series; column: Waters Spherisorb ODS-2; 150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 um). The used mobile phase was consisted of meth-anol, acetate buffer (0.05M, pH=4.6) and triethanolamine (60:40:0.02, v/v/v) with flow rate of 1 ml/min at 25.0+-0.5 degC. The injection volume was 50 ul and the detection was car-ried out at 280 nm. The EE% was calculated from the total amount of drug in the nanoparticle suspension and the quan-tity of RPD added initially during the preparation.Results and discussionIn the development of site-specific drug delivery sys-tems it is a prerequisite to identify the factors determining the carriers' in vivo behaviour and disposition. For effective brain targeting, NLCs should have a hydrophilic surface, reduced protein adsorption pattern and prolonged blood cir-culatory time in order to permit efficient and satisfied inter-actions and penetration in the brain endothelial cells.Considerable differences in BSA adsorption onto NLCs surface were detected for different stabilizers in a concentration-dependent manner and in all cases the to-tal protein adsorption was lower compared to unmodified NLCs (sample 1). NLCs prepared with Tween 80 (samples 1A1-4) resulted with lowest amount of adsorbed BSA (sur-factant concentrations: 4.0, 4.5, 5.0 and 5.5%; unbound BSA: 46.5, 65.4, 68.2 and 94.9%, respectively). The ob-tained results are in accordance with the literature data pointing that the presence of Tween 80 could minimise the interaction of the nanoparticles with serum albumin and prolong their half-life in the blood circulation (Goppert and Rainer, 2005), potentially giving NLCs best stealth charac-teristics compared to other formulations. Therefore, sam-ple 1A4, prepared with 5.5% of Tween 80 was selected for preparation of RPD loaded NLCs.The obtained unmodified NLCs (sample 1) had D50 of 107 nm and SPAN factor of 0.804 with unimodal narrow size distribution. There were no significant differences in D50 between unmodified and surface-modified particles. The D50 and SPAN of RPD loaded NLCs were 116 nm and 0.832 (sample R1), 127 nm and 0.959 (sample R10) and 123 nm and 1.012 (sample R20), respectively.The determined drug content in the prepared formula-tions was 8.8, 99.9 and 227.5 mg RPD/g lipid and the EE was 87.2, 89.9 and 91% for R1, R10 and R20, respectively. It is obvious that higher drug concentration used for prepar-ing the samples resulted with increased drug content, thus pointing that the drug/lipid ratio was a critical parameter for efficient RPD loading into the NLCs.ConclusionIn an attempt to realise the 'magic bullet' concept postulated by Ehrlich, the presented study indicates that Tween 80 stabilised NLCs could be suitable risperidone carriers with prolonged blood circulation time and site-specific brain delivery.ReferencesAlam, T., Pandit, J., Vohora, D., Aqil, M., Ali, A., Sultana, Y., 2015.

With the aging of the world population, brain-based disorders, especially neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are becoming one of the major health problems. However, brain is the most difficult organ for drug delivery and poses unique challenges. Specific anatomic and physiological features of the cerebrovasculature and cerebral tissue fluids result in barriers, i.e. blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the penetration of many molecules/substances including drugs to the central nervous system. Molecular characteristics, which are known to reduce the ability for partition/penetrance into the lipids of the cell membranes (through the BBB) are, a significant polarity, high potential for hydrogen bond formation, molecular weight of more than 500 kDa, as well as molecular structures which contain rotatable bonds and those that are highly branched (Haque et al., 2012; Mutlu et al., 2011). Accordingly, the development of brain drug-delivery systems is imperative. Among different particulate carri-er systems, liposomes have gained much attention because of their biocompatibility and structural similarity to that of cells. Liposomes can fuse with cells, facilitating the trans-port of drugs across biomembranes. Also, liposomes pos-sess excellent criteria as drug carriers, because they are closed vesicles composed of an internal aqueous compart-ment and an external lipophilic bilayer of phospholipids molecules. External surface of liposomes can be modified by polyethylene glycol (PEG) to produce stealth properties. Stealth liposomes are characterized by long circulation time in vivo and could be easily coupled to different targeting moieties in order to improve the site-specific drug delivery.Having in mind the limitations of currently available drugs for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, devel-opment of phytopharmaceutical based liposomes could be considered as an attractive alternative approach for effica-cious treatment of brain disorders. Natural polyphenols are well known organic compounds with antioxidative, free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory characteristics. In this connection, polyphenols are thought to be potential candidates in prevention and treatment of diseases caused by oxidative damage, such as neurodegenerative disorders (Mignet et al., 2013). However, they exhibit low bioavail-ability and poor solubility, which limits their use. Therefore, the aim of this study was design and formulation of PEGylated liposomes containing rosmarinic extract in order to enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of polyphenols in treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.Materials and methodsMaterials Soybean lecithin (SL) was purchased from Vitalia, Macedonia. LIPOID PE 18:0/18:0-PEG 2000 (PEG) was kindly donated from Lipoid, Germany. Cholesterol (CH) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). Rosmarin-ic extract (RA-E) was a generous gift from the Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Skopje, Macedonia. All the other chemicals and reagents were of the highest pu-rity grade commercially available and used as received.S8 OP 306642Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 641 - 642 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessionPreparation of liposomesDuring the preliminary studies, different formulations of liposomes were prepared in order to obtain vesicles with mean size of ~200 nm suitable for brain delivery (Gelden-huys et al., 2015). Optimized process parameters' were fur-ther used for formulation modification. Samples were pre-pared by the modified lipid film hydration technique. Brief-ly, required amounts of SL and CH (mass ratio=5:1, 10:1 and 20:1; samples 1, 2 and 3) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol mixture 4:1 (v/v). Afterwards, the organic sol-vents were removed by evaporation under vacuum using a rotavapor (25 degC, 50 rpm; Buchi 215, Switzerland). Thus obtained dried lipid film was hydrated with aqueous phase, phosphate buffer pH 7.4, under three hydration steps: ul-trasonication (50/60 Hz), vortexing and gentle shaking. Ev-ery step lasted 5 min and four cycles of hydration were per-formed. Obtained liposomes were submitted to high shear homogenization (24 000 rpm, 5 min; Ultra-Turrax T25, Ika-Werke, Germany) and were allowed to stand for 24 h at 4 oC. For preparation of RA-E loaded liposomes (200 mg initially added) two different approaches were performed, i). RA-E was dissolved in organic solvents mixture required for lip-id phase formation (samples 1a, 2a and 3a) and ii). RA-HE was dissolved in an aqueous phase (sample 1b, 2b and 3b).From results obtained from particle size analysis and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%), sample 2a was se-lected for preparation of PEGylated liposomes (sample P2a), where PEG was incorporated into the lipid phase (SL:CH:PEG mass ratio=10:1:0.5).Liposome characterizationPrepared liposomes were characterized in terms of mean particle size (D50) and particle size distribution (SPAN fac-tor) by laser diffractometry (Mastersizer 2000, Hydro 2000S, Malvern Instr. Ltd., UK). EE% was calculated on a basis of non-encapsulated portion of RA-E by HPLC. Analyses were performed on Merck Hitachi HPLC system (Darmstadt, Ger-many), equipped with Ellite LaChrom L-2200 autosampler, L-2130 pump and L-2450 diode array detector. The column used was Zorbax Eclipse XDB RP C-18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mm, Agilent, Germany). The used mobile phase was: A - 1% formic acid (pH 3.0) and B - acetonitrile (90:10 v/v). Chromatographic conditions were set according to the method described by Cvetkovikj et al. (2013) with small modifications. Quantification of rosmarinic acid was per-formed using UV/VIS DAD at 330 nm.Results and discussionObtained blank liposomes had D50 of 134, 129 and 130 nm (sample 1, 2 and 3, respectively) with unimodal nar-row size distribution (SPAN factor 1.905, 1.743 and 1.782, respectively). By incorporation of RA-E into the aqueous phase, no significant differences in particle size of the pre-pared samples were observed and drug EE was found to quiet low (~ 17%). On the other hand, incorporation of RA-E into the lipid film resulted with increase in lipo-somes size (D50 168, 136 and 161 nm for sample 1a, 2a and 3a, respectively), the particle distribution became broad-er and EE was 39.4-54.2%. From obtained data, it is possi-ble to come to a conclusion that procedure of RA-E load-ing into liposomes seemed to have a significant effect on D50 and EE. Also, the differences in drug EE between the two different approaches could be related to the nature and physicochemical properties of the used herbal extract.Therefore, sample 2a with D50 136 nm and EE of 54.2% was selected for preparation of PEGylated liposomes.
