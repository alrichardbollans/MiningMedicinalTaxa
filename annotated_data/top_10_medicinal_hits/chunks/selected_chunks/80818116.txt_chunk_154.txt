One approach that might be used for improvement of acne treatment efficacy and patient compliance is to incorporate API into drug delivery carriers (micro/nanoparticulated) thus enabling controlled drug release at the site of action. Having in mind previ-ous, our group is working on development of porous mic-roparticulated systems (microsponges) for topical delivery of propolis with certain physico-chemical and biopharma-ceutical properties favoring prolonged release, enhanced efficacy and patient compliance in acne treatment. In the previous work of Dodov et al. (2016) microsponges load-ed with 20% propolis ethanolic propylene glycolic extract were formulated. The current work is addressed to formu-lation and characterization of microsponges prepared with 25% propolis ethanolic extract using two different hydro-philic surfactants. Materials and methodsMaterialsEthylcellulose (EC) and Chitosan (CTS) (high vis-cous) were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich, USA. Tween 80 (T80), Tween 20 (T20), Span 80 (S80), Aceton (ACT), and Dichlormethane (DM) were obtained from Merck, Germany. Propolis ethanolic extract (PE) (25%) was sup-plied from Apimel, Macedonia. All other chemicals and re-agents were of analytical grade and used without any mod-ifications.Preparation of microsponges loaded with propolis extract The PE loaded microsponges (MPL) were prepared using previously optimized double emulsion solvent dif-fusion technique (Crcarevska et al., 2015; Dodov et al., 2016). This method involves preparation of a primary W/O emulsion, and a subsequent second emulsification result-ing in a W/O/W multiple emulsion. The primary W/O sys-tem was prepared by continuous dropwise addition of in-ternal water phase (CTS (0.8% (m/v) in 3% acetic acid (v/v)), water (W1) and ACT) to oil phase (EC, S80, DHM and PE) during a period of 4 min under continuous ro-tor-stator homogenization (Ultra-Turrax1 T-25, Dispers-ing element S25N-10G, IKA, Germany, 24000 rpm, ambi-ent conditions). After the addition of internal water phase was completed, mixing was continued for additional 1 min. Multiple W/O/W emulsion was prepared by dropwise ad-dition of primary W/O emulsion to outer water phase (wa-ter (W2) and T80 or T20 as surfactant), for time period of 10 minutes at the same conditions as for W/O prima-ry emulsion.The removal of ACT, DHM, ethanol and the solidifica-S8 OP 300630Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 629 - 630 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessiontion of MPLs was finalized under continuous mixing (24000 rpm, 40 degC, 30 min). The resulting MPL dispersion was cooled down to room temperature under magnetic stirring (200 rpm, 20 min, Variomag, Multipoint HP 15, Germany). Composition of the prepared formulations was as fol-lows: CTS (0.8%):W1:ACT (ml) = 1:0.67:5, S80/EC=0.33, T20/W2 or T80/W2 = 0.015. S80/DHM:PE/EC was 0.0039:0.5 (MPL1), 0.004:1 (MPL2), 0.0043:2 (MPL3) and 0.005:4 (MPL4). A total of 8 formulations were pre-pared. 4 formulations were prepared with T20 (MPL-T20) and 4 with T80 (MPL-T80) as hydrophilic surfactant.Nonencapsulated PE was separated and prepared MPLs were freeze dried (Freeze-dryer, Labconco, USA, 0,05 mBar, - 49 degC, 24h) in presence of cryoprotecting agent (20% trehalose/g EC)MPLs characterizationCharacterisation of particle size and particle size distribution of MPLs was done by laser diffractometry (Crcarevska et al., 2015). Particle size was expressed in micrometers (um) by volume diameter Dv50+-SD, while particle size distribution was expressed in term of SPAN factor+-SD.The non-encapsulated fraction of PE was separated from the MPLs, and the propolis content (PC) was deter-mined according to procedure described by Dodov et al. (2016). PC was expressed as dry PE (g)/EC (g)+-SD.MPL`s in vitro release studies were performed by non-membranic dissolution model (Dodov et al., 2016). In brief, accurately weighted amounts of freeze-dried MPLs with known and equal content of PE (0.002 g dry PE/ ml) were placed in closed glass tubes on thermostat water-bath hor-izontal shaker (4h, 32 degC, 40 rpm, (Unitronic OR, Selecta, Barcelona, Spain)). In appropriate time intervals the sam-ples were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 5 min) (Tehtnika Centric 322B, Slovenia) and 8 ml of the total volume of superna-tants were collected. This volume was replaced with 8 ml of distilled water (32 degC) and dissolution studies continued.Drug release data were fitted into zero order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas and Peppas and Sahlin model (DD-Solver 1.0 - Microsoft Excel menu-driven add-in program).Results and discussionDv50 for formulations prepared with T20 as hy-drophilic surfactant was 26.67+-2.15 um (MPL1-T20), 34.79+-6.46 um (MPL2-T20), 89.72+-5.64 um (MPL3-T20) and 157.05+-31.86 um (MPL4-T20), while for those pre-pared with T80, Dv50 was 31.56+-1.19 um (MPL1-T80), 75.56+-1.02 um (MPL2-T80), 96.15+-4.01 um (MPL3-T80) and 475.47+-17.24 um (MPL4-T80). Particle size for freeze dried MPLs was 9.14+-0.27 um (MPL1-T20), 20.41+-0.87 um (MPL2-T20), 36.25+-1.89 um (MPL3-T20), 117.68+-4.19 um (MPL4-T20), 25.26+-0.0.66 um (MPL1-T80), 22.87+-1.35 um (MPL2-T80), 33.50+-3.32 um (MPL3-T80) and 117.09+-11.51 um (MPL4-T80). Obtained results pointed that particle size increased with increment of PE/EC. When particle size of freeze dried MPLs was compared significant difference was determined in MPL1-T20/MPL1-T80 (one way ANOVA, Fischer LSD, p<0.05).PC expressed as dry PE (g)/EC (g) was 0.37+-0.07 in MPL1-T20, 0.74+-0.02 in MPL2-T20, 1.47+-0.04 in MPL3-T20 and 2.93+-0.1 at MPL4-T20, while in MPLs prepared with T80 as hydrophilic surfactant it was 0.33+-0.05 in MPL1-T80, 0.73+-0.12 in MPL2-T80, 1.41+-0.22 in MPL3-T80 and 3.35+-0.23 in MPL4-T80. It can be concluded that increment of PE/EC resulted with increased PC most likely due to the higher amount of PE available for encapsulation into MPLs. Significant difference was observed among all samples except MPL1-T20/MPL1-T80, MPL2-T20/MPL2-T80 and MPL3-T20/MPL3-T80 (one way ANOVA, Fisher's LSD, p<0.05). Dissolution studies pointed that release of PE from MPLs was continued for 3-4 hours, indicating prolonged release compared to PE alone (immediately dissolved). Dissolution profile comparison using pairwise procedure - f2 similarity factor, resulted with f2 values >50 in all tested formulations except MPL1-T20/MPL1-T80. It can be an-ticipated that lack of similarity is most likely related to the difference in their particle size.Drug release data best fitted to model of Peppas and Sahlin, a model accounted for the coupled effects of Ficki-an diffusion and case II transport. However, a negative K1 value indicated insignificant effect of Fickian diffusion on drug release.ConclusionMPLs loaded with 25% PE were prepared by dou-ble emulsion solvent diffusion technique. Influence of the amount of used propolis (PE/EC= 0.5, 1, 2 and 4) and type of hydrophilic surfactants (T20 and T80) on MPLs prop-erties was evaluated. By subsequent incorporation of pre-pared MPLs into gel system additional prolongation of PE release could be achieved, thus resulting with a topical dos-age form with appropriate controlled released properties in favor of efficient acne treatment.

Macedonia* veronika.stoilkovska@gmail.comIntroductionSt. John's Wort Oil (Hyperici Oleum) is a traditional herbal preparation which is prepared by fatty oil macera-tion of the flowering aerial parts of Hypericum perforatum Linn. (fam.Hypericaceae) in sunlight for several weeks (EMEA/HMPC/101303/2008). It is used mainly external-ly for the treatment of wounds, especially burn wounds, bruises and swellings. Internally, it is used to treat dyspep-sia (Kovar and Maisenbacher, 1992). In the Ph. Eur. official are St John's Wort (Hyperici herba) and St. John's Wort dry extract, quantified (Hyperici herba extractum siccum), but not St. John's Wort Oil (Hy-perici oleum) (Anyzewska et al., 2010). St. John's Wort Oil (Hyperici Oleum) is official according to the German Commission E and Swiss Pharmacopoeia. These pharma-copoeias suggest spectrophotometric determination where hypericin content is expressed as sum of all derivatives of hypericin like hypericin, pseudohypericin, protohyper-icin and isohypericin (Anyzewska et al., 2010, EMEA/HMPC/101303/2008).Hypericin which is naphtodiantrone, has specific pro-tonation and deprotonation behavior. The protonation be-havior of carbonyl groups is assigned to the pKa= -6, depro-tonation of OH groups in position 3 and 4 to the pKa= 2 and second deprotonation assigned to the pKa= 9, which gener-ates diphenolate ion by ionization of one of the OH groups in position 1, 6, 8 or 13. This indicates that hypericin is pres-ent as an anion under most circumstances due to its rather low pKa value of 2 (Wirz, 2000). Specific conditioning of Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) cartridges is crucial since it positively charges the stationary surface with which bond-ing of hypericin is enabled and separation from the vegeta-ble oil is possible, which is one of the main challenges. The aim of this study is to develop HPLC method for quantitative determination of hypericin in St John's Wort oil using solid phase extraction as sample preparation method and compare it to the official spectrophotometric pharmacopoeial method. Materials and methodsPlant material: Aerial flowering parts of wild H. per-foratum populations were collected from locality Stracin, R. Macedonia. Preparation of Hyperici Oleum: Herbal drug (crushed, fresh flowers and dry upper aerial part) and vegetable oil (sunflower oil) ratio was 1:4. The transparent glass jars containing the herbal drug and vegetable oil were left at sunny place for 6 weeks. Afterwards the herbal drug was pressed out and oil extracts were collected in dark, cylin-drical flasks (EMEA/HMPC/101303/2008). Primary reference standard hypericin was purchased from HWi Analytik GmbH, Rulzheim, Germany with 89.73% purity. Methanolic solution of the standard (0.006 mg/mL) was prepared (Hm). Solution of hypericin stan-dard in sunflower oil (0.006 mg/mL) was prepared (Ho). For SPE, n-hexane dilution of Ho was done (H1=0.006 mg/mL and H2=0.003 mg/mL). 2 mL of each, commercial St. John's Wort oil (B1) or St. John's Wort oil (crushed fresh flowers in sunflower oil) (B2) were diluted to 10 mL with n-hexane. For the spiked sample (B3), 1 ml Ho and 1 ml B1 were diluted to 5 mL with n-hexane. Sample preparation was done using solid-phase ami-nopropylsilica extraction cartridges (Sep-Pak(r), 6cc, 500 mg sorbent), which were conditioned sequentially with 10 mL each of 0.01 N NaOH, methanol, acetone and n-hex-ane (Kovar and Maisenbacher, 1992). Samples were load-ed on SPE-NH2 cartridges using vacuum manifold and S8 OP 301632Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 631 - 632 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessionthen the cartridge bed was rinsed with 12 mL of n-hex-ane. Elution was done with 4 mL 5 % (m/V) oxalic acid in acetone:methanol (1:1 V/V) (Eoa) or with mobile phase (Emp). For HPLC analysis the following eluates were ob-tained: EmpH1, EmpH2, EmpB1, EoaB1, EmpB2, EoaB2, EmpB3 and EoaB3.The chromatographic analyses were carried out using Agilent 1200 HPLC equipped with DAD G1315D, quater-nary pump G1311A, column thermostat G1316A and ther-mostatted autosampler G1329A. Separation was achieved using Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 mm). The isocratic mobile phase at a flow 1 mL/min con-sisted of 78 mL ethyl acetate, 82 mL sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution adjusted to pH 2 with phosphoric acid and 360 mL methanol. Injection volume was 20 mL and the wavelength of detection was 590 nm. The separation was performed at 40@C (Monograph of St. John's Wort dry ex-tract; Ph. Eur.8).For spectrophotometric measurements a Perkin- Elmer UV/ VIS spectrophotometer Lambda 16 was used. Results and discussionWith SPE procedure, the vegetable oil was successful-ly separated and the phytocomponents were clearly eluated into the eluates, with characteristic red colour.With HPLC analysis of EmpH1, EmpH2, EmpB3 and EoaB3 eluates a peak of hypericin was identified, with Rt and UV/ VIS spectrum corresponding to the results ob-tained by HPLC analysis of the methanolic solution of the hypericin standard (Hm). Relative peak intensity of the tar-get component- hypericin was higher in Emp eluates com-pared to Eoa eluates. By analysis of EmpH1, EmpH2, EmpB3 and EoaB3 satisfactory selectivity of the SPE pro-cedure and HPLC method for hypericin were proven. HPLC analysis of EmpB1, EoaB1, EmpB2, EoaB2 did not reveal any peak corresponding to hypericin, suggesting that target component may not be present in form of hyper-icin in St. John's Wort Oil.
