Collected packages for downloading corpora

# Filtering Summary

After the relevant datasets have been downloaded, we then filter them by sets of keywords.

Firstly, we get a set of manually created product-specific keywords e.g. 'medicine', 'drug'. These are extended by getting all varied word forms using
the Python nltk.corpus package. This generated list is then manually reviewed and any erroneous generated keywords are removed.

Secondly, we get a set of plant-specific keywords. These are manually generated and then extended with lifeform descriptions provided by WCVP. Again,
this is extended by getting all varied word forms using
the Python nltk.corpus package.

Finally, we get plant name keywords. These are generated by taking all genus and family names (including synonyms) given in the WCVP.

Given a downloaded paper, the paper is included in the output if any of the above keywords appear in the paper text.
