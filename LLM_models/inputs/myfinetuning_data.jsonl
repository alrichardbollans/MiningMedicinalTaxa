This means that a product license can be admitted based on scientifi c literature published on the substance. The literature must show that the substance has established medical use and that it has acknowledged effi ciency and acceptable safety.1353 According to directive 1999/83/EC1354, a medicinal product, also a herbal medicinal product, has a record of well-established medicinal use if it has been used as a medicine in the EU territory for at least 10 years. In practice, applications for authorisation of herbal medicines are often based on established medicinal use, not clinical tests and trials1355.If someone wants to market an herbal medicine that does not have established medicinal use in Europe, he must complete clinical trials similar to those for synthetic medicines. Under the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), there is a Committee on Herbal Medicines. The Committee was established in 2004, and it gives scientifi c opinions on herbal medicines. One of the basic guidelines concerning herbal medicines drafted by the EMEA committees is the 2006 Guideline on Quality of Herbal Medicinal Products and Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products1356.5.5.1.3 Traditional Herbal MedicinesTraditional herbal medicines are a new European regulatory category created by Directive 2004/24/EC. It is a tailor-made category for products on which there is not enough scientifi c literature to make them well established in a sense that they could be authorised in the primary procedure for medicines. Traditional herbal medicines can be registered in a simplifi ed procedure called 'traditional-use registration'.According to preamble 5) of the Directive 2004/24/EC, \"the long tradition of the medicinal product makes it possible to reduce the need for clinical trials, in so far as the effi cacy of the medicinal product is plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience\". According to Article 16(a)(e), the data on the traditional use of the medicinal product must be suffi cient, in particular:the product must prove not to be harmful in the specifi ed conditions of use, and -the - pharmacological effects or effi cacy of the medicinal product must be plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience.This means that products categorised as traditional herbal medicines, require no clinical data to show proof of effi cacy. The difference between a literature-based herbal medicine application and a traditional herbal medicine registration is that in the primary procedure, 10 years of established medicinal use is enough, and in the simplifi ed procedure, 30 years of traditional use is enough. Established use means scientifi cally established through adequate published 1353 Enkovaara 2002, 20.1354 Commission Directive 1999/83/EC of 8 September 1999 amending the Annex to Council Directive 75/318/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to analytical, pharmacotoxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of medicinal products.1355 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.nam.fi /laaketeollisuus/rohdosvalmiste/kasvirohdosvalmiste/index.html.1356 Available on EMEA web page at: http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/qwp/281900en.pdf.-245-data. The borderline between established use and traditional use still remains unclear, and EMEA guidelines are expected on the subject.Because effi cacy of traditional herbal medicines is not based on scientifi c trials, there is certain mandatory information that must be given to the consumer. There is an obligation to include in the labelling, the package leafl et and in any advertising the information that the product is a traditional herbal medicinal product and that the effi cacy has not been clinically proven but relies exclusively on long-term use and experience; and that the user should consult a doctor or a qualifi ed medical practitioner if the symptoms persist during the use of the medicinal product.Compared to chemical medicines, there is still a relative lack of rigorous clinical trials on herbals. The effi cacy of herbal medicines has been tested in hundreds of clinical trials, but this volume of data is still small considering the thousands of plants that are used as medicines. Studies have shown that herbal medicines might often have fewer serious side effects compared to pharmaceuticals. They might also offer just as effective remedies with lower cost. However, the evidence on these benefi ts is incomplete.1357 This is why the legislator has had to settle with the above- described approach, where the product can be marketed based on history of use, but the consumer has to be informed of the lack of evidence. The decision on whether to trust a traditional herbal medicinal product is on the consumer.The lack of trials is mostly due to the fact that the herbal industry is small and can rarely afford the considerable expense of a clinical trial. Public funds are not often dedicated to research of herbal medicines. The EU directive harmonising the registration of herbal medicines did not offer any incentives for companies to invest further into research. Research is needed to enable knowledge-based use of herbal medicine.1358 At the moment, a consumer must rely more on faith and less on facts when using herbals. The lack of complete evidence is possibly holding back the optimal use of herbals. There are arguments against 'history of use' as a ground for authorisation. Historically, there have been long-standing traditions of treatments later proven to be ineffective.5.5.1.4 Homeopathic MedicinesHomeopathic products can be approved either in the primary authorisation procedure for medicines according to Article 16(1) or their own simplifi ed registration procedure according to Article 14(1) of the Medicinal Products Directive 2001/83/EC. In practice, the simplifi ed registration scheme \"appears to be applicable to the majority of homeopathic medicinal products\"1359. The primary procedure is problematic as regards Mutual Recognition. In case of disagreement between Member States, referrals to the EMEA Committee on Human Medicinal Products do not apply to homeopathic medicinal products.1360According to Article 14(3) of the Medicinal Products Directive, proof of therapeutic effi cacy is not required of the homeopathic products registered according to the simplifi ed procedure. Correspondingly, the labelling of those products shall bear the following information: 1357 Ernst 2003.1358 Ernst 2003. 1359 Report on EMEA Workshop on Homeopathic Medicinal Products. London, 27th October 2006. Page 6.1360 Report on EMEA Workshop on Homeopathic Medicinal Products. London, 27th October 2006. Page 7.-246-\"homeopathic medicinal product without approved therapeutic indications\".1361 Article 15 lists the information needed in the simplifi ed procedure. This information includes bibliographical data concerning the product's homeopathic nature1362. This means homeopathic use of the product must be presented, for instance, on the basis of the literature.1363The rules of the simplifi ed procedure indicate that a consumer must get the product (s)he orders, but effi cacy is not guaranteed. A consumer may or may not believe that because the product has been used in homeopathy for condition X, it is effective for condition X. As discussed above in chapter 4, the Member States may or may not establish the simplifi ed procedure. This had led to an unharmonised state, which creates obstacles to practitioners of homeopathy. The dispute on whether homeopathy is actually effective goes on worldwide. The Lancet attacked homeopathy in 2005 stating that a review of 110 trials found no convincing evidence the treatment worked any better than a placebo1364.5.5.2 Chinese Rules on Medicinal ClaimsThe rules on effi cacy and marketing are basically the same for modern and traditional medicines in China. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains a recognised and valued source of treatment1365. The Chinese government has supported the development of both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in China. As described above in chapter 4, the Chinese intend to be a global leader in bringing herbal medicine into the 21st century by establishing modern standards.1361 If homeopathic medicinal products are placed on the market with therapeutic indications or in a form, which may present risks that must be balanced against the desired therapeutic effect, the usual rules governing the authorisation to market medicinal products are applied. This means that in these cases, the same market authorisation and labelling rules apply as to immunological medicinal products.1362 Article 15: \"An application for special, simplifi ed registration may cover a series of medicinal products derived from the same homeopathic stock or stocks. The following documents shall be included with the application in order to demonstrate, in particular, the pharmaceutical quality and the batch-to-batch homogeneity of the products concerned: - scientifi c name or other name given in a pharmacopoeia of the homeopathic stock or stocks, together with a statement of the various routes of administration, pharmaceutical forms and degree of dilution to be registered, - dossier describing how the homeopathic stock or stocks is/are obtained and controlled, and justifying its/their homeopathic nature, on the basis of an adequate bibliography, - manufacture and control fi le for each pharmaceutical form and a description of the method of dilution and potentisation, - manufacturing authorisation for the medicinal product concerned, - copies of any registrations or authorisations obtained for the same medicinal product in other Member States, - one or more specimens or mock-ups of the outer packaging and the immediate packaging of the medicinal products to be registered, - data concerning the stability of the medicinal product. \"1363 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.nam.fi /english/pharma_industry/herbal_remedy/homeopathic/index.html.1364 BBC News 26 August 2005.1365 China-Britain Business Council. China-Britain Business Review Archive. -247-According to the new Chinese Standards and Measures on medicine advertising (2007), claims on the curative effects of medicines in advertisements must be scientifi c and accurate and may not contain any of the following content:unscientifi c assertion or guarantee of effi cacy; -claims of curative rate or effi ciency; -comparison of effects and safety with other medicines; -explicit or implicit suggestion that the drug can heal all diseases and is good for all -symptoms in contravention of the rules of science;suggestion that the medicine is \"safe with no toxic side effect\" or has \"very little toxic -side effect\";for proprietary Chinese medicine, explicit or implicit suggestion that it is \"natural\" and -guaranteed safe;explicit or implicit suggestion that the medicine is essential for normal daily life and -for the treatment of diseases;explicit or implicit suggestion that the medicine can help one cope with the tension of -modern life, studies or examination, and can help boost academic performance, energy, competitiveness, height and intelligence;other unscientifi c terms or suggestions such as \"the latest technology\", \"state-of-the-art -science\" and \"the most advanced methods of preparation\".The rules on therapeutic claims are thus the same for modern and traditional medicines, with no special categories for medicines without proven therapeutic effi cacy. However, the scientifi c criteria for effi cacy are not yet established.5.6 Food and Medicine Marketing: ConclusionsAs with safety, there are no particular rules on the marketing of functional foods. Again, this is because there is no legal category of functional foods. General marketing rules apply to the marketing of functional foods. Marketing must be decent and truthful. In addition, food marketing or medicine marketing rules apply. As with safety, marketing rules of foodstuffs vs. medicines vary considerably. The main difference is that foods are allowed to bear health claims, and medicines are to have medicinal claims.General rules on food marketing are largely the same within the EU and in China. The mandatory ingredient list will advise the consumer on what is in the product, and misleading advertising is prohibited. China has recently introduced legislation on nutrition labelling and nutrition claims, which is comparable to its European counterpart. Guideline daily amounts (GDA) are used as a guide for consumer.Health claims are allowed both in the EU and in China. In China, a category of health foods has been created. Health foods are the only foods that can bear health claims, and no foods can bear medicinal claims. The category of health foods is suitable for all foods with health effects, including normal foods, fortifi ed foods and food supplements. In Europe, normal foods, dietetic foods and food supplements can bear health claims. The EFSA and the Commission have defi ned the borderlines of nutrition claims and the two separate types of health claims: -248-function claims and disease risk reduction claims. The separation between disease risk reduction and disease prevention is the separation between foodstuffs and medicines.The general rules on medicine marketing are also largely the same in the EU and China. The basic law guarantees that consumers receive enough information on the use of the medicine, on its therapeutic effects, side effects, precautions etc. The law also prohibits typically unethical marketing methods such as targeting children. The Chinese government has recently improved laws on medicine marketing to tackle the serious problems that have occurred.With regard to effi cacy, which is closely related to the medicinal claim, the required scientifi c proof varies according to the type of medicinal product. In Europe, legislators have created separate categories of traditional herbal medicines and homeopathic medicines, for which no scientifi c proof of effi cacy needs to be presented. On the other hand, no therapeutic claims can be presented for these products. This means the legislator has left it up to the consumer to decide whether to trust the product based on tradition only. For regular medicines, the requirements for scientifi c tests and clinical trials are very strict, and the EMEA evaluates the evidence on behalf of the consumer.In China, foods have always been used for medicinal purposes. Medicinal products are divided into two: traditional Chinese medicines and modern medicines. Compared to Europe, China is putting more emphasis on traditional medicines and developing them side-by-side with modern medicines. China is building a science-based approach and modern legislation on traditional medicines. In the future, effi cacy of traditional medicines will be evaluated according to special legislation.The laws on marketing of foodstuffs and medicines are often disobeyed both in China and in Europe. Illegal marketing practices are common regarding health foods, dietetic foods and food supplements. These are often marketed as medicines. In China, there have been serious cases of fake medicines. With health-related products, certain factors lead to misleading marketing: Consumers are ignorant compared to businesses, consumers cannot immediately determine if the product is effective or not, and health is so important to consumers that they are willing to pay for it even if the result is uncertain. This means there are lucrative earnings available for swindlers. It is a challenging job for legislators to make deception unprofi table. -249-6 CASE: THREE CHINESE BERRIES6.1 Case IntroductionIn this chapter, we draw conclusions on the European and Chinese legal systems from an entrepreneur's perspective. For this purpose, a case concerning fi ctional health-enhancing products and their legal status is presented. This means investigating how the legislation works in the situation of three Chinese plants aimed at fi ghting the metabolic syndrome.The chosen plants are:Hawthorn fruit (1) Crataegus pinnatifi da, Chinese hawthorn)Emblic leaffl ower fruit (2) Phyllanthus emblica), andChinese wolfberry fruit (3) Lycium barbarum L.).1) 2) 3) These berries have qualities that make them promising raw materials for functional foods. We are interested in how these plants are/would be legally evaluated in EU and in China. Our hypothetical goal is to produce functional foods utilising the health-enhancing properties of these three berries, and to legally sell the products to consumers.The important legal questions are:Which are the applicable rules?A) Is it possible to sell the products as foods and/or medicines?B) If foods, will the products be classifi ed as novel foods?C) If novel foods, which are the requirements for authorisation?D) Which will be the marketing claims available?E) Exotic fruits and berries have shot to popularity in the last couple of years, particularly because of their antioxidants and vitamin C. The food industry calls this the 'superfruit' trend. -250-Food and beverage manufacturers are developing products to reply to consumer demand for wolfberries, cranberries, noni, and blackberries for example.1366 6.2 Scientifi c Background6.2.1 Target DiseasesThe metabolic syndrome is a condition where a person is overweight and in risk of getting cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This means the person has high blood pressure, low level of (good) HDL cholesterol, high level of (bad) LDL cholesterol, insulin resistance and/or glucose intolerance. The condition is called metabolic syndrome, because the risk of contracting heart trouble and the risk of getting diabetes are often associated with the same persons. The lipid (fat) metabolism and the glucose (sugar) metabolism are closely connected, and both are connected to obesity. By treating metabolic syndrome it is possible to prevent type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Researchers link the rise in metabolic syndrome to growing affl uence, changing lifestyles and growing urbanisation1367. The syndrome is common in middle-aged and older persons. According to Hu et al., the overall prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in non-diabetic adult Europeans is 15%1368. The WHO estimates that metabolic syndrome is present in 7-36% of European men and 5-22% of women aged 40-55 years1369. According to a 2005 study, 13.7 % of Chinese adults has metabolic syndrome1370. According to He et al., the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is 46% in Beijing elderly people1371, 35% in men, 54 in women1372.1373These fi gures are important as they point out that the syndrome causes a lot of human suffering and huge economic losses. What is interesting to us is that obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are largely nutrition problems.1374 The metabolic syndrome can often be prevented and/or treated by diet, where functional foods can be one part of dietary therapy.Obesity is the basic culprit for many health problems. Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.1375 In Europe, around half of the adult population 1366 Nutraingredients.com Europe."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Crataegus pinnatifi da', 'medical_conditions': ['metabolic syndrome'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Phyllanthus emblica', 'medical_conditions': ['metabolic syndrome'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Lycium barbarum L.', 'medical_conditions': ['metabolic syndrome'], 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

Their correctbotanical provenance is an essential basis for understanding the ethnic cultures, aswell as for chemical identification of the novel bioactive molecules with therapeuticeffects. This work describes the use of herbal medicines in the Beskid mountain rangeslocated south of Krakow and Lviv, two influential medieval centers of apothecary traditionin the region. Local botanical remedies shared by Boyko, Lemko, and Gorale ethnicgroups were a part of the medieval European system of medicine, used according totheir Dioscoridean and Galenic qualities. Within the context of ethnic plant medicineand botanical classification, this review identified strong preferences for local use ofSt John's-wort (Hypericum perforatum L.), wormwood (Artemisia absinthium L.), garlic(Allium sativum L.), gentian (Gentiana lutea L.), lovage (Levisticum officinaleW.D.J. Koch),and lesser periwinkle (Vinca minor L.). While Ukrainian ethnic groups favored the use ofguilder-rose (Viburnum opulus L.) and yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), Polish inhabitantsespecially valued angelica (Angelica archangelica L.) and carline thistle (Carlina acaulisL.). The region also holds a strong potential for collection, cultivation, and manufactureof medicinal plants and plant-based natural specialty ingredients for the food, healthand cosmetic industries, in part due to high degree of biodiversity and ecologicalpreservation. Many of these products, including whole food nutritional supplements, willsoon complement conventional medicines in prevention and treatment of diseases, whileadding value to agriculture and local economies.Keywords: ethnobotany, traditional knowledge, herbal texts, bioactive compounds, functional foods, folkremediesINTRODUCTIONThe terms Beskids or Beskid Mountains (Beschad Alpes Poloniae) denote the Carpathian mountainranges that historically separated kingdoms of Poland from Ruthenia (Ukraine) and Hungary asdescribed in the 1269 Hungarian deed (Papee, 1891). The Beskids are approximately 600 km inlength stretching from Moravian Gate in the west (Czech Republic) to Vyshkovsky Pass in the216Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicineseast (Ukraine) along the modern Polish-Slovak border, but arerather narrow (50-70 km in width). Gorale, Lemko, Boyko, andRusyn ethnic groups of mixed Slavic, Vlah (Aromanian) andThraco-Celtic origins primarily populate these areas (Figure 1).During tenth-fourteenth centuries, Beskids formed a transborderregion of limited political and economic affiliation, defined bya line of defensive border settlements (La: ultra indagines, Ua:zasiky, Pl: bron) advancing slowly toward the mountain ridgesalong the Spis-Borzhava axis in the south and Myslenice-Sanok-Dolyna axis in the north (Halaga, 1961). Turka on the route toUzhok Pass and Wietrzno-Bobrka on the route to Dukla Passwere typical examples of such defensive hillforts (Ua: gorodysche,Pl: grodzisko). In the fourteenth century, continuous colonizationof the Beskids was described as of Ruthenus, Ruthenus-Valachus,Ruthenos seu Valachos, or Valachus origin (Hoshko, 1983).The ongoing debate whether these terms identified a properethnic affiliation of the migrants or their rustic (agricultural) vs.valachian (pastoral) background has not been settled (Stavrovsky,1967). The transborder status, however, combined with severegeographical and socioeconomic isolation, resulted in self-treatment as a primary choice of both medicinal and spiritualhealing. Even at the beginning of the twentieth century, onemedical doctor served on average 9,000-17,000 inhabitants(Otchet, 1915), and a doctor's reputation and recognition waswell below that of a local pharmacist or a traditional healer.The use of plants and their preparations in Europeanmedicine, drawing upon the traditions of both the classical andArab civilizations, was formalized by works of Hippocrates ofKos (Corpus Hippocraticum), Dioscorides (De Materia Medica),Pliny (Naturalis Historiae), Avicenna (Liber Canonis), andGalen of Pergamon (Hidden Drugs, survived only in Arabictranslation as Al-Adwiya al-Maktuma) as the science of usingfresh plants and dry herbs to improve human health (Cruse,1999). Prior to 900-1200 AD, however, no written recordsdescribed traditional herbal treatments used by Celtic, Slavic,and Germanic tribes that bordered the Roman Empire. Firstmedieval manuscripts that partially documented the use ofherbs in these areas were largely translations from earlierFIGURE 1 | Study area that includes Beskin ridges of the Carpathin Mountains: (A) Schematic map of the mountain region that serves as a border between Ukraine,Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania, and (B) Schematic mountain areas inhibited by Gorale, Lemko, Boyko, Rusyn, and Hutsul ethinc groups.Latin works that incorporated local variations in methods ofcollection, preparation, and use (Singer, 1927), including Bald'sLeechbook andOld English herbals (Anglo-Saxon, tenth-eleventhcentury), Regimen Sanitatis (Italian, tenth century), Physiciansof Myddvai (Welsh, fourteenth century), and various editionsof [H]ortus Sanitatis (1491) based on the German HerbariusMaguntie impressus of 1484 and Herbarius zu Teutsch of 1485.The latter monographs were intended to treat of cheap andhomely remedies for the use of the poor, as most herbs listed inthese books were native or garden plants, while very few exoticremedies were described in details.A glimpse of medieval Slavic herbal tradition could befound in the tenth-eleventh century manuscripts Izborniki(Anthologies, transcribed in 1073 and 1076 for PrinceSvyatoslav of Kyiv from manuscripts that had belonged toTsar Simeon of Bulgaria) that described medicinal uses ofseveral plants, including henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), hemlock(Conium maculatum), and wormwood (Artemisia absinthium).Subsequent herbal manuscripts (Ua: travnyk, zilejnyk, vertograd,Pl: zielnik) from sixteenth to eighteenth centuries often combinedtraditional herbal medicines with irrational magical applications.For example, while the seventeenth century vertograd describedmanagement of fever and pain with cabbage (Brassica oleracea)and beet (Beta vulgaris) leaves, and infection diseases with onion(Allium cepa) and garlic (Allium sativum), it also prescribed amixture of horse and goat manure to cure alopecia in 3 days(Krylov, 1985). Nonetheless, these manuscripts served duringthe late Middle Ages as veritable manuals of practical herbalmedicine. Their text and images were usually mechanicallytranscribed from earlier works of the most varied provenance,while the successive owners often enriched the contents withpersonal observations and experiences.OLDEST HERBALS PRINTED IN THECARPATHIAN FORELANDFoundation of Prague University in 1348 and Krakow Universityin 1364 provided diverse educational opportunities for wealthyFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 295217Kozlowska et al. Botanical Provenance of Carpathian Herbal Medicineslocal families of Polish and Ruthenian descent, and led to theexpansion of local medicinal and apothecary tradition. Krakow,and later Lviv, quickly developed into two influential medievalcenters of apothecary, with former also serving as an importantpublishing site of printed herbal texts.Here, six major monographs describing the use of medicinalplants were published between 1532 and 1613 (Table 1). Thefirst one was a Latin reprint of De Herbarum Virtutibus (Naples,1477) with plants names translated into Polish for the first timeby Simon de Lowicz in 1532. Its significance lies in the factthat it was the first document of such length to indicate arenewed interest on this subject and to reveal direct influenceof Dioscorides and Pliny. Even though there was no evidenceof experimentation, and whether or not the author actually everattempted to use any of the herbs of which he wrote, this herbalhad a tremendous influence on medical and botanical literaturefrom the early Middle Ages (Flood, 1976). One testimonialto the wider influence Macer had on subsequent medical andbotanical commentators was a large number of translations ofthe herbal into vernacular languages and dialects. Its popularitywas likely partially due to the selection of predominantly nativeEuropean plants (39) or medicinal herbs cultivated in thegardens (25) over the exotic plants (13) that were difficult toprocure.Stefan Falimirz (Falimir, a Ruthenian courtier to JanTenczynski, the Duke of Podola in Krasnik) compiled variousLatin [H]ortus Sanitatismanuscripts, translated them into Polish,and released a first popular encyclopedia of traditional medicinesentitled O ziolach i o mocy ich (On herbs and their power)in Krakow (1534). The subjects covered herbs and herbalmedicines (including the first use of Polish term wodkameaning\"little water\" to describe high proof spirit distilled from grain),medicinal properties of animals and minerals, obstetrics, surgery,and were profusely illustrated with over 550 mostly originalwoodcuts. Plants were described in a set of 261 articles onEuropean and 69 exotic herbal remedies. Descriptions of plantsand their use, however, were mostly translations from theprevious sources and likely unknown to the author (Elbanowski,2014). This became very clear when compared to other chaptersdescribing animals, where Stefan provided extensive and originaldetails on local fishes, a subject apparently of great familiarityto the author. Specifically, Stefan stated, \"Because we live inPoland, there is a need to know characteristics and use of Polishfishes, as we use them regularly. The ones that help, the ones thatharm, the good, the better, and the worst.\" This statement for thefirst time indicated the emerging perception of inadequacy ofcontemporary Latinmanuscripts that lacked local knowledge andtradition.HieronimSpiczynski ofWielun (a wealthy Polish councilmanin Krakow) attempted an adaptation of Stefan Falimirz's work bypublishing O ziolach tutecznych y zamorskich y o mocy ich (Onlocal and overseas herbs and their power, 1542) with improvedwoodcuts. The monograph contained similar and often identicaldescriptions of several medical guides to practical use of herbalremedies. The catalog of herbs was focused on local plants listedunder Polish and Latin names, with a shorter list of exotic plantsidentified only in Latin. Compared to other herbals, it containednarrower descriptions of plant species with no mention of theirorigin or occurrence.Marcin Siennik (Merten Heuwrecher, a wealthy merchantof German origin in Krakow) compiled another adaptation ofFalimirz's herbal 26 years later as Herbarz to jest ziol tutecznych,postronnych i zamorskich opisanie (Herbal as description oflocal, foreign and overseas plants, 1568). Quick comparisonamong these editions revealed minor changes in the order ofthe chapters, woodcuts, and plant names. Siennik held neither aprofessional title nor a degree, and seemingly edited books solelyto make income in accordance with publisher's instructions. Theonly freedom that he enjoyed was expanding the list of plantnicknames, to which he contributed many new names, howeverboth descriptions and uses of various remedies were transcribedintact, together with all previous errors and omissions.

Plants were listed in Latin alphabetical order and wereheavily influenced by independent translations from DioscoridesMateria medica and Fuchs Cometraii insignes. Among those,only 259 chapters described wild native plants characteristic ofthe Polish countryside. The woodcuts, however, were the sameones used in Siennik herbal to depict 240 local herbs-and forthis reason, the rest of the herbal remedies were illustratedby woodcuts that were repeated or omitted altogether. Theindividual reports lacked a particular order of presentation, withsome chapters organized by location, description and use, whileothers discussed herbal properties prior to their looks and origins(Rostafinski, 1888).Szymon Syrenius (Syreniusz, Syrenski) of Oswiencim, agraduate of Krakow and Padua Universities, moved to Lvivand established his medical office there in 1578."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Brassica oleracea', 'medical_conditions': ['fever', 'pain'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Beta vulgaris', 'medical_conditions': ['fever', 'pain'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Allium cepa', 'medical_conditions': ['infection diseases'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Allium sativum', 'medical_conditions': ['infection diseases'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Hypericum perforatum L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Artemisia absinthium L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Gentiana lutea L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Vinca minor L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Viburnum opulus L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Achillea millefolium L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Angelica archangelica L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Allium sativum L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Levisticum officinaleW.D.J.

PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS11.1 - AN OVERVIEW' The plant kingdom is the source of most of thesubstances that affect our mental processes,behavior, or that alter our perception of theuniverse around us.' We have become dependent upon a series ofplant products that provide these psychoactiveeffects.' Many of these plants are used by individuals;others are used more commonly in a ceremonialor ritual context where they have becomeimportant elements in our religions, myths, andmagic.' These plants contain one or more chemicals(often alkaloids) that stimulate, depress, producea sense of well-being, or cause us to hallucinate.' This category overlaps with medicinal plants(opiates, cocaine, marijuana), beverages (tea,coffee, cocoa, alcohol), spices (nutmeg), andrecreational ones (tobacco).' Only a few of these plants (tobacco, alcohol, tea,coffee, cacao, coca, marijuana, and opium) are ofeconomic significance. Most of the others areused locally.' Most of what we experience from psychoactiveplants can be explained by the toxic effects thatthey have on our central nervous system.' For some yet unexplained reason, the New Worldhas more psychoactive plants than the Old World.' Many psychoactive plants are not as dangerousas their critics suggest, nor are they as risk freeas their proponents believe them to be.' Terms such as psychoactive, hallucinogenic,addictive, and narcotic have reasonably precisedefinitions, but they are often lost in everydaydiscussions.' Recent research has brought into question thepsychoactive properties of several plants withlong standing reputations, such as the mescalbean.11.2 ! INTRODUCTION\"If human consciousness is the most wonderful thingon earth, the attempt to fathom the depths of thepsychophysiological action of narcotic and stimulatingdrugs makes this wonder seem greater still.... Sucheffects are brought about by chemical substances. Themost powerful of these are products of the vegetablekingdom, into whose silent growth and creativeabundance man has not yet fully penetrated. By theexercise of their powers on the brain, they releasemarvelous stores of latent energy. They relieve thementally tortured, assuage the racking pains of thesick, inspire with hope those doomed to death, endowthe overworked with new vitality and vigour such asno strength of will could attain, and replace for anhour the exhaustion and langour of the overworked bymental comfort and conten(tL. \"ouis Lewin, Phantastica)\"Experiences with plant drugs have puzzled andfascinated our species for millennia. They haverevealed substances powerful enough to heal or to kill.Yet, whether they help or hurt, these plants are alsopursued for their power to intoxicate with stimulating,inebriating, tranquilizing, or hallucinogenic properties.We search our planetary garden for these mind-altering delights with a passion so blinding that thegarden becomes a labyrinth, the search becomes thegoal, and our passion becomes addiction. \"(Ronald Siegel, Intoxication)\"Every kind of addiction is bad, no matter whether thedrug be alcohol, morphine or idealism.\" (Carl Jung)' ' ' ' 'There are about 250,000 different kinds of plants.Only a 150 or so have been used as sources ofpsychoactive substances in either primitive oradvanced societies. Siegel (1989) has suggested thatif we look at the history of our species we will discoverthat the use of these intoxicants is one our four basicdrives, along with hunger, thirst, and sex. Of theseplants, only tobacco, opium, coca, cacao, marijuana,coffee, tea, and alcohol are of any commercialimportance.WHAT TO CALL THEM?Scholars have found it difficult to come up with anacceptable collective name for this category of plants.Those that have been suggested include: deliriants,delusionegens, eidetics, entheogens, genussmittel,hallucinogens, misperceptinogens, mysticomimetics,phanerothymes, phantastica, phantasticants,psychedelics, psychodelics, psychotica, psychoticants,psychogens, psychosimetics, psychodysleptics,psychotaraxics, psychotogens, psychomimetics,psychotomimetics, psychotropic, and schizogens.WHY DO WE USE THEM?Various authors have suggested the following reasonsfor our use of these plants. They are not in anyparticular order of importance.' to alter moods' to explore self' to escape boredom and despair' to enhance sensory experiences and pleasure' to stimulate artistic creativity and performance' to improve physical performance' to treat disease' to rebel-197-' to go along with peers' to establish an identity' to aid in religious experiences.HOW DO WE USE THEM?We have discovered a variety of ways of introducingpsychoactive materials into our bodies. Eating,drinking, and smoking of plant materials come quicklyto mind. Less obvious methods include mastication(chewing on plant material without swallowing it),inhaling/snuffing, applying materials to the skin (oftenmixed with animal fat), putting finely ground powdersunder our eyelids, injecting via the hypodermic needle(a 19th century invention), and inserting material intothe nostrils, rectum, and vagina.These different approaches have something incommon. They are designed to bring the psychoactivesubstance into contact with capillary-rich tissues or tointroduce them directly into the circulatory system.This is their pathway to chemical binding sites in thecentral nervous system. Depending on the methodemployed and the chemicals involved, it can take onlya few seconds to a few minutes for these psychoactivesubstances to reach the brain.THEIR EFFECTSWe are dealing here with plant materials that haveprofound or significant effects on our mentalprocesses. They affect our mental activity, ourbehavior, and even our perceptions of the worldaround us. Many of these substances are intoxicantsthat either dull the senses or stimulate them. Othersare narcotics. In the popular sense, this term is usedfor any dangerous drug. In the narrower sense,narcotics are those materials that induce drowsiness,sleep, or anesthesia. Some of these plants canproduce addiction. You can become enslaved to itsuse. Addiction is characterized by craving for thematerial, developing a tolerance to it, and sufferingreasonably serious trauma when we attempt to ceaseusing it (withdrawal).The classification developed by Louis Lewin (1931)may be helpful in understanding the breadth of effectsof psychoactive plants. He recognized five classes:Excitantia. \"Their action, which extends to the brainand particularly to the cerebral cortex, is a purelyexciting or stimulating one, which, even if highlyconcentrated and intense, produces these effectswithout calling forth serious symptoms of fatigue orinhibition of the functions.\" Examples: tobacco,caffeinated beveragesInebriantia. \"A primary phase of cerebral excitationis followed by a state of depression which mayeventually extend to complete temporary suppressionof functions.\" Examples: alcoholic beveragesHypnotica. These are the sleep-producing agents.Example: kavaEuphorica. \"These substances diminish or evensuspend the functions of emotion and perception intheir widest sense, sometimes reducing orsuppressing, sometimes conserving consciousness,inducing in the person concerned a state of physicaland mental comfort.\" Examples: coca and opiumPhantastica. \"... I mean the action of chemicalsubstances capable of evoking such transitory stateswithout any physical inconvenience for a certain timein persons of perfectly normal mentality who arepartly or fully conscious of the action of the drug...These phenomena may be accompanied or followed byunconsciousness or other symptoms of alteredcerebral functioning.\" Examples: marijuana, fly agaric,sacred mush-rooms, nutmeg, Jimson weed, andpeyoteYou may be surprised to find coffee, tea, chocolate,and the various alcoholic beverages classed aspsychoactive. How could it be otherwise? These plantshave been discussed elsewhere and will not be treatedfurther here. The remaining three categoriesconstitute the subjects for this section. The last class,the Phantastica, is probably the most interesting.These plants, in particular, have been afforded a veryspecial place in both primitive and advanced societies.They are the plants that bring about hallucinations.We can perceive an external object or stimulus withany of our five senses. There are visual (sight),auditory (hearing), olfactory (smell), tactile (touch),and gustatory (taste) hallucinations.SOME CHEMICALCONSIDERATIONSThe chemical basis of the activity of the many plantsclassed as psychoactive is incompletely understood.Many species have had their active principles analyzedin great detail. Others remain completely unknown.The chemical nature of the Excitantia and Inebriantiahave been discussed elsewhere. Kava of the Hypnoticacontains methysticin and other components in a seriesof related substituted 5,6-dihydro-a-pyrones. Coca ofthe \"Euphorica\" contains about 25 alkaloids, of whichcocaine is the best known. The hallucinogens ofLewin's \"Phantastica\" contain a variety of activeprinciples, most of them containing nitrogen. A few ofthe hallucinogens are partly or wholly synthetic.Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), for instance, doesnot occur naturally in plants, although LSD-likesubstances are found.CHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHOACTIVESGroup: Plant Chemical GroupExcitantia:Tobacco Alkaloids (nicotine)Coffee Alkaloids (caffeine)Tea Alkaloids (caffeine)Chocolate Alkaloids (caffeine)Khat Alkaloids (d-norpseudoephedrine)Inebriantia:Alcoholic beverages Alcohol (ethanol)Hypnotica:Kava kava Dihydro-a-pyronesEuphorica:Coca leaf Alkaloids (cocaine)Opium Alkaloids (morphine codeine)Betel nut Alkaloids (arecoline)Phantastica (Hallucinogens):Ayahusaca Alkaloids (tryptamine carboline)Belladonna Alkaloids (tropane)Datura (Jimson weed) Alkaloids (tropane)Fly agaric Alkaloids (muscimol)Marijuana Resins (tetrahydrocanninols)-198-Mescal bean Alkaloids (quinolizidine)Nutmeg Phenylpropenes (myristicin)Ololiuqui Alkaloids (ergoline)Peyote Alkaloids (mescaline)Sacred mushrooms Alkaloids (tryptamine)Snuffs Alkaloids (tryptamine)P S Y C H O A C T I V E P L A N T SGroup: Family Scientific Name (Common Name) Part Used Where Used (Type)FUNGIAgaricaceae Amanita muscaria (fly agaric, soma) Sporocarp Eurasia (H)Agaricaceae Conocybe spp. (sacred mushroom) Sporocarp Mexico (H)Agaricaceae Panaeolus sphinctrinus (sacred mushroom) Sporocarp Mexico (H)Boletaceae Boletus spp. (kuma mushroom) Sporocarp New Guinea (H)Clavicepitaceae Claviceps purpurea (ergot) Sclerotium (beak) Widespread (H)Lycoperdaceae Lycoperdon mixtecorum (gi-i-wa) Sporocarp Mexico (H)Lycoperdaceae Lycoperdon marginatum (gi-i-sa-wa) Sporocarp Europe & N.

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Controlling blood glucose levels is one of the main goals of every therapeutic approach used to treat the disease in order to avoid complications that could result in premature death of T2D patients. In developing countries such as Mexico, diabetic patients consume infusions of medicinal plants to control this disease. In particular, the usage of the aerial parts of Eryngium cymosum F. Delaroche by locals of Tlanchinol and Huejutla de Reyes municipalities was detected in the Hidalgo state. Hence, we aimed to assess the hypoglycemic effect of its traditional extract and then it was evaluated on two of the main mechanisms responsible of fasting and post-prandial hyperglycemia: gluconeogenesis and carbohydrate breakdown by alpha-glucosidases. In addition, insulin was measured in the two conditions to stablish a link between the hypoglycemic effect and insulin-related mechanisms. The results showed that the E. cymosum extract exerted a significant hypoglycemic effect in STZ-NA rats that could be related to the inhibition of gluconeogenesis since the extract held a significant anti-hyperglycemic effect in pyruvate tolerance tests (AUC reduction of 38%). Moreover, it powerfully inhibited the activity of glucose-6-fosfatase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (91% and 96%, respectively). On the other hand, it was able to significantly decrease the post-prandial hyperglycemia in maltose tolerance tests (AUC reduction of 46%) regardless of a modest inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity (32%). Finally, insulin levels were unchanged after the administration of the extract indicating that its hypoglycemic effect is not associated to insulin-related mechanisms. In conclusion, the traditional consumed form of E. cymosum presents a hypoglycemic effect that is mainly related to its inhibitory capacity of gluconeogenesis, contributing to the reduction of fasting and post-prandial hyperglycemia.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org23420th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP122. Amelioration of insulin resistance and inhibition of gluconeogenic rate-limiting enzymes by 3 Mexican medicinal plants.G. Mata-Torres, A. Andrade-CettoLaboratory of Ethnopharmacology, School of Science, National Autonomous University of Mexico, MexicoType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease that affects the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins partially due to insulin resistance. The liver of a diabetic patient produces 35 g extra of glucose per day because of hepatic insulin resistance; therefore, inhibiting the hepatic glucose production is a good target for the control of high glucose levels. In traditional medicine, Ageratina petiolaris (Ap), Cecropia obtusifolia (Co) and Equisetum myriochaetum (Em) have been used by people in some communities of the Hidalgo State in Mexico for the treatment of T2D. In previous works we demonstrate their hypoglycemic effect as well as the effect over gluconeogenesis in a pyruvate tolerance tests in STZ-NA hyperglycemic rats. Therefore, the aim of this study was to stablish whether this effect was caused by allosteric inhibition of rate-limiting enzymes of the gluconeogenic pathway. Additionally, the effect of the extracts on insulin resistance was assessed in STZ-NA hyperglycemic rats. The results showed that, after 42 days of treatment, extracts of Ap, Co and Em reduced both glucose and triglyceride levels of the hyperglycemic rats. The extracts also improved glucose tolerance by reducing the AUC glucose vs the control. Furthermore, Ap and Co reduced HOMA-IR indices. The enzymatic assays showed that while the extracts of Ap and Co inhibited the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) (IC50 = 223 and 146 mg/ml, respectively), Em did not. Moreover, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (F-1,6-BisPase) was inhibited by the three extracts (IC50 = 41, 238 and 64 mg/ml, respectively). In conclusion, the inhibition of gluconeogenesis exerted by these plants could be explained by the reduction of the activity of either G-6-Pase or F-1,6-BisPase and additionally they decreased insulin resistance, which contribute to diminish the glucose levels.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 23520th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP123. Nerolidol induced apoptosis in blader carcinoma (TCC SUP cell line) by activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway.M. Radan1, M. Glumac2, V. Cikes Culic21 Faculty of Chemistry and Technology, University of Split, Croatia2 School of Medicine, University of Split, CroatiaNerolidol is a sesquiterpene alcohol occurring in many essential oils. In recent years it has been a subject of numerous studies showing many beneficial properties which could be used to treat broad range of health problems including viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections, inflammation and cancer. The aim of present work is to investigate the effect of nerolidol on human bladder carcinoma (TCC SUP cell line) and the pathway leading to apoptosis.In order to assess the pathway leading to apoptosis of TCC SUP cell line induced by nerolidol, series of tests were performed. Cell proliferation assay, conducted by means of MTT staining, was used to determine cytotoxicity of nerolidol on investigated cell line. As a reference, well known chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin was used. To find out the mode by which nerolidol is decreasing the number of the cells, apoptosis quantification using Annexin/PI staining was used. In order to provide additional information about apoptosis induced in the cell culture, impact of nerolidol on two signaling molecules (Ca2+ and cAMP) was determined. To further demonstrate that apoptosis is the main way involved in nerolidol-induced cell death, immunostaining of p38 MAPK proteins was done. Results suggest nerolidol induces apoptosis by activating p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Cell proliferation assay suggests nerolidol has a cytotoxic effect on tested cells in concentration and time dependent manner. Anexin/PI test done for nerolidol concentration of 0.05 mg/mL after 48-hour incubation, confirms that nerolidol induces apoptosis in TCC SUP cells. Immunostaining results show increase in active p38 enzyme forms suggesting inducement of apoptosis by this signaling pathway. Nerolidol induces a strong calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum after drug administration. Administration of nerolidol increases level of cAMP suggesting nerolidol activates adenylate cyclase.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org23620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP124.

ChaiModern Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, ChinaBawei Chenxiang Powder (BCP) is a traditional Tibetan folk medicine formula which has been used in clinic for more than 1300 years. It includes the resinous wood of Aquilaria sinensis, kernel of Myristica fragrans, fruit of Choerospondias axillaris, travertine, resin of Boswellia carterii or B. bhaw-dajiana, stem of Aucklandia lappa, fruit of Terminalia chebula (roasted), and flower of Gossampinus malabarica. BCP has the function of clearing heart heat, nourishing heart, tranquilizing mind, and inducing resuscitation in traditional medicine. Modern research shows that the chemical composition of BCP mainly contains terpenoids (sesquiterpenes, triterpenes), polyphenols (flavonoids, lignans), and tannins, which exert the pharmacological activities such as anti-myocardial ischemia, anti-cerebral ischemia, spatial learning and memory promotion. However, most chemical studies are the single herbs of BCP and lack of the overall analysis of this formula considering the cross-reaction of compound ingredients. Based on the multi-component, multi-path and multi-target effects, the modern technologies such as metabolomics, system pharmacology, system biology and others were used to investigate the material basis and mechanism of action of BCP. In short, as a typical representative of valuable resources of Chinese medicine, BCP is widely used in Tibetan and Mongolian traditional medicine that are worthy of further study and beneficial to the solution of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 23720th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP125.

Even though treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy are available, the percentage of adverse effects is light with low survival rate. In the era of new therapeutic drugs for various ailments, medicinal plants and natural compounds are promising alternatives for cancer treatment. Zaleya decandra is one such medicinal plant attracting researchers to explore the biomedical importance of the plant. Considering the pharmacological significance of Z. decandra, the current research work was put forth for the first time to validate the in vitro anti-proliferative activity of ethanolic root extract of Zaleya decandra (EEZD) against the human ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line (PA1). The preliminary phytochemical analysis showed the presence of alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, and sterols. The increase in the generation of ROS in Z. decandra treated cells indicate that the phyto-constituents present in the extract alone or in combination could have targeted this enzyme while exerting anti-proliferative effects. The mitochondrion membrane potential (MMP) in Z. decandra treated PA-1 cells using cationic fluorescent dyes displayed a drastic reduction in the rhodamine binding indicating reduced mitochondrial activity. ROS induced DNA damage by Z. decandra in ovarian cancer cell is evident as stained by AO/EtBr which could probably be mediated by ROS induced inhibition of PARP-1 by the constituents present in Z. decandra. Therefore the present study warrants extensive investigation using pre-clinical model system to substantiate the findings. Since the toxicological studies report the safety of Zaleya decandra, it promises to emerge as a possible alternative drug to treat ovarian cancer.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org23820th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP126. Evaluation and analysis of clinical value of phytotherapeutic potential of natural herbal medicines in the treatment of asthma.W.T. Liao1,2, C.C. Su31 Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan 2 Chinese medicine department, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan3 Post Baccalaureate Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, TaiwanAsthma is one of the most common chronic diseases with a multifactorial etiology that is characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Affecting approximately 358 million people worldwide. Over the past decades, the global prevalence, mortality, morbidity, and economic burden of asthma have increased. The treatment response for a particular patient may be difficult to predict due to the heterogeneous nature of asthma. For many decades, natural herbal medicines, polyherbal formulations and decoctions of plant-derived materials have widely been accepted as alternative complementary therapies for the treatment, cure or prevention of a wide range of chronic airway inflammation diseases including chronic sinusitis, chronic otitis media, chronic pharyngitis, chronic rhinitis, and chronic laryngitis and asthma. This review was aimed to summarize and critically discuss about the therapeutic viability and clinical applicability of natural herbal medicines for the treatment of asthma in human. The critical analysis of the literature revealed that oral and acupuncture application of natural herbal medicines exhibit remarkable potential for the treatment of asthma in adults. In this review, the clinical efficacy of various herbal formulations such as Chinese herbal formula therapies, single herb therapies, acupuncture and diet therapy for the treatment of asthma has been discussed. Conclusively, we recognized that natural herbal medicines demonstrate remarkable clinical efficacy when used alone or in conjunction with other complementary therapies for the treatment of asthma patients.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 23920th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP127. Insights into the distribution and diverse applications of southern African indigenous Kei-apple as a potential candidate for commercialization.A.O. AremuFood Security and Safety Niche Area, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, North West University, Mmabatho, North West Province, South AfricaIndigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) Centre, Faculty of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, North West University, Mmabatho, North West Province, South AfricaGlobally, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of indigenous plants in new product development. However, existing basic and fundamental information on interesting indigenous plants need to be critically examined in order to provide a foolproof pathway for commercialization. Kei-apple known as Dovyalis caffra L. is a member of the family Salicaceae. Presently, Kei-apple is found in many southern African countries such as South Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Furthermore, the plant is widely reported in most of the provinces in South Africa. An estimated 28 different genotypes from different parts of South Africa are currently maintained in a National facility (Agricultural Research Council farm, Friedenheim, Nelspruit, Mpumalanga Province; 25.4884deg S; 30.4028deg) in South Africa. Kei-apple is recognized as an underutilized wild fruit with great potential and high commercial prospect. In ethno-medicine, the value of different parts of Kei-apple for treating different disease conditions in humans and livestock is well-recognized. Kei-apple is used for producing jelly jam, nectars and fruit leather and home-made beverage. As a result of its durability and presence of thorn, it is highly preferred for fencing (forming an impenetrable hedge) gardens in rural communities. Sales of the fruit also serve as source of income in some parts of South Africa. These aforementioned diverse applications provide the basis for more focused and co-ordinated research to fully explore the commercial potential locked in Kei-apple. Thus, critical aspects especially detailed basic research in the botany for selection of genotype(s) with desired traits is paramount. In addition, effective propagation approach/protocol and efficient orchard management need to be devised in order to optimize fruit yields for the anticipated commercialization demands.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org24020th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP128.

Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra PhD February 2016 i Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Abstract Herbal medicines (HMs) have been used to supplement, maintain, and treat health conditions, and have inspired the development of many Western pharmaceuticals. Migrant South Asian (SA) communities in the UK have brought with them their own traditional forms of medicine, yet little is known about their current use of HMs in the UK. Consuming HMs alongside conventional Western medicines could affect pharmacological treatment and lead to herb-drug interactions; hence, healthcare professionals (HCPs) should be aware of their patients' use of HMs. The import of HMs to the UK raises concerns over the quality, safety and regulation of HMs. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) barcoding can be used to discriminate between different species, and identify contaminants and adulterants, thus can be used for the authentication of HMs. The South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) questionnaire explored the knowledge and use of HMs by diasporic SA communities in the UK. It uncovered a vast range of HMs which were used by participants, where ingredients were sourced from, the concurrent use of herbal and Western medicines, and how minor ailments were treated. An online survey designed to investigate UK based practitioners' views of HMs revealed that HCPs claimed to lack sufficient knowledge of HMs. HCPs said they needed more training on HMs to help them make better informed decisions. Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) was identified as a culturally and commercially valuable plant, which was used for molecular analysis. A variety of tulsi samples were collected for authentication: community samples from SA families in the UK, commercial samples, and referenced specimens. Both ITS and trnH-psbA regions were successfully used to distinguish between several Ocimum species, and identify a potential species substitution. This research represents the first time that DNA based methods have been used to authenticate medicinal plants species used by migrant SA communities living in the UK. The results of this multi-disciplinary study provide a unique contribution to the evolving discipline of ethnopharmacology. ii Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Acknowledgements Firstly, I would like to thank my parents (Hardev Singh and Kulwant Kaur) for their unconditional love and support throughout this journey; especially my mum from whom I have inherited this knowledge and passion for herbal remedies.

The cytotoxiceffect of the isolated compounds 1 to 6 was monitored with theCV test for 24 h at 5 and 10 uM on a panel of three murineand three human cancer cell lines. 5-Fluorouracil was used asa positive control at equimolar concentrations as the studiedcompounds (Figures 4, 5). The isolated flavonoids 1 and 2 didnot demonstrate cytotoxic activity against the majority of cancercell lines at the applied concentrations. Only compound 3 exerteda noticeable cytotoxic effect against HeLa cells (Figure 4). Amongthe isolated STLs, 5 showed the most prominent cytotoxicactivity. In particular, compound 5 reduced the cell survival ofSCCVII cells to 42% at 10 uM and 50% at 5 uM concentration(Figure 5). It also exhibited promising activity against Caco-2cells at 10 uM and HeLa cells at both concentrations applied(Figure 5). On the other hand, 5 had weak (cell survival was85% at 10 uM) or no activity (> 95% at 5 uM) againstnormal fibroblasts (V79). Moreover, while compound 4 did notshow significant cytotoxic effects on any cell line at the appliedconcentrations, compound 6 showed noticeable effects againstSCVII and FsaR cells at 10 uM.Cytotoxic Activity of Ragusinin (5) inHeLa Cell LineIn order to determine the biological effect of the most activecompound 5 (Figure 5) in more detail, we used MTT assay andHeLa cells as experimental model (Cimbora-Zovko et al., 2011).Ragusinin decreased cell survival of HeLa cells in aconcentration-dependent manner in comparison to untreatedcells (Figure 6). The dose that killed 50% of the cell population(IC50 value) after 72 h of continuous treatment with 5 wasbetween 1.8 and 2.3 uM (Figure 6).To better understand the mechanism underlying the cellgrowth impairment by 5, the cell cycle progression wasinvestigated. HeLa cells were treated with increasing doses of5 during 48 h. As shown in Figure 7A, compound 5 triggersthe accumulation of HeLa cells in the G2 phase of cell cycle.Moreover, a compound 5 induced dose-dependent increase ofcells in the Sub G1 population indicates a ragusinin-triggered celldeath (Figure 7A). The same was confirmed by treatment of cellswith 10 uM of 5 during 24-72 h. Time-dependent accumulationof HeLa cells in the G2 phase is detectable as well as time-increaseof cells in the Sub G1 phase of the cell cycle (Figure 7B).In order to determine the type of cell death triggered by 5,the cells were treated with increasing doses of the compoundand 48 h later, FACS-Annexin V/PI staining was performed.Our results show a ragusinin-induced dose-dependent apoptosis(Figure 7C). We then performed Western blot analysis of specificcell death markers, PARP and caspase-3 cleavage, followingtreatment with 1.25 and 2.5 uM of 5 for 24-72 h. Theobtained results were interesting since 5 did not induce PARP(Figure 7D) and caspase-3 cleavage (Figure 7E). The assumedcaspase-independent cell death triggered by 5 was in additionconfirmed by measuring the absence of caspase activity 3/7 byCaspase-Glo R(c) 3/7 Assay (data not shown). The occurrence ofcaspase and PARP cleavage independent cell death indicatessome alternative cell death pathway described in the literatureto be triggered by a different type of cell stressors (Kroemer andMartin, 2005; Tait and Green, 2008). This is the first example ofcaspase independent cell death described for compound 5.Role of Glutathione (GSH) in Protectionof Cells From Ragusinin (5)We were further interested in the possible role of GSH asa protector of cells in ragusinin-induced cell death. For thatpurpose, HeLa cells were either pre-treated with 5 mM NAC,the precursor for GSH synthesis, for 2 h prior to treatmentwith compound 5 or overnight with a specific inhibitor of GSHsynthesis, i.e., 0.001 mM BSO. The conditions used were testedpreviously to be effective (Brozovic et al., 2008; Brozovic et al.,2014). The obtained data showed that an increased level ofGSH protects HeLa cells from ragusinin's toxicity (Figure 8A).At the same time, depletion of GSH decreased cell survival ofHeLa cells compared to cells treated with compound 5 only(Figure 8B).Due to the fact that GSH instills several vital roles withina cell including antioxidation, maintenance of the redox state,modulation of the immune response, and detoxification ofxenobiotics (Balendiran et al., 2004), we discussed first its possiblerole as an antioxidant. It is known that the cytotoxicity of thesesquiterpenes helenalin and cynaropicrin can be affected viageneration of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Choet al., 2004; Jang et al., 2013). We examined that possibility forFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97217fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 10Grienke et al.

The cells were treated either with 2.5, 5, and10 uM of compound 5 for 48 h (A) or with 10 uM during 24-72 h (B). Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry upon cell staining with PI. Therepresentative data of three independent experiments which yielded similar results are shown. The cells were either non-treated or treated with 2.5, 5, and 10 uM of5.

Results showedthat antioxidants, as well as salubrinal (Brozovic et al., 2013), i.e.,an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum stress, had no impact onragusinin's toxicity (Supplementary Material, in SupplementaryFigure S6). Thus, we further explored the capability of 5 to reachfunctional protein targets in living cells without being deactivatedby reaction with GSH. The combination treatment of HeLa cellswith the well-known inhibitor of glutathione S-transferase (GST)ethacrynic acid (Osmak et al., 1998) (c = 5 ug/mL) decreased cellsurvival compared to cells treated with 5 only (Figure 9). The dataimply the enzymatically regulated formation of a detoxificationcomplex between GSH and 5.DISCUSSIONAmong the isolates (1 to 6) from the traditionally used herbalremedy C. ragusina L. leaves, we discovered an interestingpharmacological profile for the rare guajanolides ragusinin (5)and hemistepsin A (6).

Moore (Zdero et al., 1989) and is characterized byan isovalerate residue in position C-9a; compound 6 has beendescribed previously as a constituent from leaves and flowers ofHemisteptia lyrata Bunge (Jang et al., 1999).Whereas both natural compounds showed no antibacterialactivity against the Gram-negative A. baumannii, they exhibitedmoderate inhibitory activity against S. aureus ATTC 25923(MIC value of 31.3 ug/mL, Supplementary Material). Forcomparison, three STLs (13-acetylsolstitialin A, centaurepensin,and chlorojanerin) isolated from the aerial parts of Centaureasolstitialis L. ssp. solstitialis showed inhibitory activity againststandard S. aureus with MIC values of 16 ug/mL (Ozceliket al., 2009). In line with these findings, we focused on a moreprominent cytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds and theinvestigation of the mechanism of action of the most activecompound 5.We investigated the binding of isolated compounds to DNAsince studying the interactions of compounds with potential drugtargets and the knowledge of their antiproliferative activity canhelp in forming the hypothesis about the mechanism of action ofnovel compounds.The isolated flavonoids (1-3) exhibited only weak interactionswith DNA which may explain the absence of cytotoxic effectsagainst the majority of studied cell lines. The somewhat strongercytotoxic activity of flavonoids against HeLa cells can be ascribedto interactions with biological targets other than DNA (Chenet al., 2012). Compound 3 with the highest number of hydroxygroups on the flavonoid skeleton exhibited the most pronouncedcytotoxic activity. This finding is in agreement with literature data(Beutler et al., 1998; Jeong et al., 2007; Csupor-Loffler et al., 2009).While there are numerous reports on DNA binding affinitieswith flavonoids (Kanakis et al., 2005; Rusak et al., 2010), thereis little data on DNA binding interactions with sesquiterpenes(VujcVic' et al., 2007). Regarding the structure of 5 and literaturedata (Gates, 2009; Chadwick et al., 2013), the interactionwith DNA can be achieved via noncovalent binding todouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or by alkylation of DNAnucleophiles through reaction with the a-methylene-g-lactonegroup. Several studies on the reactivity of STLs toward OH-or N-nucleophiles (Atta-ur-Rahman, 2011) and CD changeswhich were not consistent with an alkylation effect (Agarwalet al., 2014) (Supplementary Figure S4) do not support thelatter possibility. In addition, the -SH group was found to bemuch more susceptible to alkylation by sesquiterpenes than othernucleophiles (Gewirtz et al., 2007). A reasonable explanationbased on our results from ITC and CD is noncovalent bindingof 5 most probably inside a hydrophobic interior of the DNAgroove. Due to its rather moderate binding affinity to ctDNA, itcan be concluded that the cellular DNA is not 5's primary targetin the living cell.Among the isolated STLs, compound 5 showed the strongestcytotoxic activity, especially on murine SCVII as well as humanCaco-2 and HeLa cell lines, while no cytotoxic effect on normalV79 fibroblasts was observed. Similar to the antibacterial activity,a correlation between the cytotoxic activity and the type andproperties of the substituents on the central ring in the vicinity ofthe a-methylene-g-lactone group was observed. In comparisonto less lipophilic substituents of sesquiterpenes, as observed forFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97219fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 12Grienke et al. Centaurea ragusina L. Isolates' BioactivityFIGURE 10 | A summary of the most significant results obtained in this study.6 and especially 4, the hydrophobic character of the isovalerateresidue of 5 most probably enables better penetration throughthe cell membrane and consequently better antibacterial andcytotoxic activity. In the literature, cytotoxic effects of variousSTLs have been explained by selective alkylation of growthregulatory macromolecules such as enzymes which control celldivision and thus a variety of cellular functions (Lyss et al., 1998;Rasul et al., 2012).Since compound 5 (ragusinin) showed the strongest activitycompared to other isolates and since the biological activityof 5 was not described before we decided to investigate themechanism of its toxicity in more details. The IC50 value ofragusinin was between 1.8 and 2.3 uM (Figure 6). This isconsistent with data from the literature, where compounds ofsimilar chemical structure, i.e., sesquiterpene lactones such ashelenalin (Gertsch et al., 2003), neoambrosin (Saeed et al.,2015), and damsin (Villagomez et al., 2013), are reported tobe cytotoxic against various cell lines in the micromolar range.Further analysis revealed time-dependent accumulation of HeLacells upon ragusinin treatment in the G2 phase and Sub G1phase of the cell cycle (Figure 7B). But, the occurrence ofcaspase and PARP cleavage independent cell death indicatessome alternative cell death pathway described in the literatureto be triggered by a different type of cell stressors (Kroemerand Martin, 2005; Tait and Green, 2008). The phenomenon isinteresting to follow up further, especially because it is knownthat helenalin, a STL isolated from Arnica montana, inducesthe same atypical form of cell death which does not includethe activation of classical mediators of apoptosis (caspases,AIF, Omi/HtrA2, and Apaf/apoptosome) (Hoffmann et al.,2011).In a series of noteworthy reports on the reactivity andkinetics of helenalin and helenanolide type STLs with GSH,it was demonstrated that at physiological pH helenalin reactswith GSH almost exclusively via its cyclopentenone structurewhile the a-methylene-g-lactone site is less reactive (Schmidtet al., 1999). Since the guajanolide 5 possesses one reactivesite, i.e., the a-methylene-g-lactone group that can reactwith GSH, we decided to investigate the role of GSH indeactivation of 5.From the literature is known that GSH is one of the majorendogenous antioxidants. In the cytoplasm, GSH is used as asubstrate for glutathione peroxidase in the reduction of H2O2and lipid hydroxyperoxides, a reaction that produces glutathionedisulfide, the so-called oxidative form of GSH. Glutathionedisulfide is rapidly reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase. Thisredox cycling of GSH plays a role in the maintenance of cellularredox homeostasis. GSH binds to endogenous and diversexenobiotic electrophilic compounds either catalytically, throughthe action of glutathione S-transferase, or non-catalytically(Townsend and Tew, 2003; Brozovic et al., 2014). The formedGSH conjugates can be exported from cells, resulting in the loss ofcellular GSH. Our data showed that variation of GSH amount inthe cell induced by a specific precursor in GSH synthesis, NAC ora specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis, BSO had an impact on HeLasurvival upon treatment with 5 (Figure 8). Similar results wereobtained in human colon tumor cells upon BSO and helenalintreatment (Jordan et al., 1987)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Centaurea ragusina L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['antibacterial']}, {'scientific_name': 'Hemisteptia lyrata Bunge', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['antibacterial']}, {'scientific_name': 'Centaureasolstitialis L. ssp. solstitialis', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['inhibitory activity againststandard S. aureus']}, {'scientific_name': 'C. ragusina L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Arnica montana', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

Therefore, the composition ofthis extract was studied in an activity-guided approach. Since no data on the secondarymetabolites of this plant were available, first phytochemical data were collected in thecourse of the fractionation of the extract. The study resulted in the identification of 14substances, among them very rare iridoids, such as scrovalentinoside or koelzioside,and several flavonoids (e.g., nepitrin and homoplantaginin). One of the latter group,2''-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin, is a new natural compound. In the most active fraction,the flavonoid hispidulin was identified as major component and the assay of thepure compound confirmed a contribution of hispidulin to the CCID-inhibitory effectsof S. lucida. The activity of the two major iridoids in this assay was less compared tohispidulin.Keywords: Scrophularia lucida L., iridoids, phenolic compounds, 2''-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin, hispidulin,intravasation, circular chemorepellent-induced defects (CCID) assayINTRODUCTIONSpecies of the genus Scrophularia have been applied for centuries in traditional medicine.The most important one among those, Scrophularia ningpoensis Hemsl., is widely used intraditional Chinese medicine for a broad spectrum of inflammatory diseases (De SantosGalindez et al., 2002; Tong et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009) and listed in the ChinesePharmacopeia against febrile diseases with excessive thirst or eruptions, constipation, coughdue to exhaustion, conjunctivits, skin disorders, and others (Stoger, 2017).

Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assaytreatment of inflammatory disorders, wound healing, skinailments, and health disturbances has been reported fornumerous species such as Scrophularia auriculata L. orScrophularia canina L. from the Mediterranean area (Giner et al.,2000; Guarrera and Lucia, 2007; Passalacqua et al., 2007) as well asfor Scrophularia variegata M. Bieb. and Scrophularia striata Boiss.in traditional Iranian medicine (Azadmehr et al., 2013, 2015).A traditional use as an antipyretic and anti-inflammatory agentwas described for Scrophularia oldhamii Oliv. and as a diuretic forScrophularia grossheimii Schischkin (De Santos Galindez et al.,2002). In Turkish traditional medicine, the species Scrophularianodosa L. is well-known as a diuretic, to treat hemorrhoids, andalso for wound healing, eruptive skin diseases, eczema, psoriasis,and pruritus (Baytop, 1999; Stevenson et al., 2002; Crisan et al.,2009). A use in these indications is also conveyed for the Turkishspecies Scrophularia depauperata Boiss., Scrophularia cryptophilaBoiss. et. Heldr. Boiss., and Scrophularia floribunda Boiss. et. Bal. (Ozbilgin et al., 2014).Recently, the activity of various extracts from severalScrophularia species has been studied in different cancer models:weak cytotoxic activity of an ethanolic extract from S. striatavia induction of apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest was shownin Jurkat human leukemia cells (Azadmehr et al., 2013). InWEHI 164 fibrosarcoma cells, a methanolic extract of this plantexhibited a significant and dose-dependent reduction of theactivity of matrix metalloproteinases (Hajiaghaee et al., 2007),which play a role in tissue remodeling and tumor invasion.An apolar fraction from a methanolic extract of Scrophulariaorientalis L. significantly reduced the viability of neuroblastomacells due to a loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity (Langeet al., 2016). In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, weak cytotoxicity of anethanolic extract from S. variegata was reported (Azadmehr et al.,2015). A dichloromethane extract from Scrophularia oxysepalacaused significant cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in MCF-7 cellsby influencing the expression of p53, caspase 3, and c-myc, andthe cleavage of PARP (Valiyari et al., 2013). The anti-tumoractivity of S. oxysepala in breast cancer was confirmed in vivo inan allograft model in mice inoculated with mammary carcinoma4T1 cells. Animals treated with 50 or 100 mg/kg of an ethanolicextract developed significantly smaller tumors in size and weight(Baradaran et al., 2017). In a study of five Scrophularia species,S. floribunda and Scrophularia lucida L. displayed the highestcytotoxic activity against HL-60 promyeloic leukemia cells. Theseextracts were also tested in a three-dimensional co-culture cellmodel consisting of MCF-7 breast cancer spheroids placed on topof telomerase-immortalized human lymph endothelial cell (LEC)monolayers. There, tumor spheroids cause the formation of largecell-free areas in the lymph endothelial barrier, so-called \"circularchemorepellent induced defects\" (CCIDs), through which tumorcells penetrate the vasculature. This assay mimics intravasationwhich is an early step within the metastatic cascade resemblingthe pathological situation in rodents and humans (Madleneret al., 2010; Vonach et al., 2011; Viola et al., 2013). A detannifiedmethanolic extract of S. lucida L. was the most active one insuppressing CCID formation (Giessrigl et al., 2012).The lack of any information about the chemical compositionof S. lucida prompted us to perform an activity-guided search forthe active principle of this species contributing to the inhibitoryeffect in the CCID assay.EXPERIMENTALGeneral Experimental ProceduresHispidulin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All otherflavonoids for dereplication were on stock at the Department ofPharmacognosy, University of Vienna.For TLC, silica gel plates or HPTLC plates RP-8 (Merck,Germany) and the mobile phases (1) CHCl3-CH3COOHconc.-MeOH-H2O (60:32:12:18), (2) EtOAc-HCOOHconc.-CH3COOHconc.-H2O (100:11:11:20), (3) EtOAc-MeOH-HCOOHconc.-H2O (75:15:4:4), or (4) MeOH-H2O (90:10)were used.A Shimadzu LC-20AD pump, an SPD M20A diode arraydetector, a CTO-20AC column oven, and a SIL 20AC HTauto-sampler (Kyoto, Japan) served for analytical HPLC on aLuna 5 u C-18 (250 mm x 4.6 mm) column (Phenomenex,United States) at 25*C and a flow rate of 1 mL/min.

Ethnopharmacological investigations of Vietnamese medicinal plants used for the treatment of inflammation and cancer.H. Thi Tran, T. Thanh Nguyen, N. Kretschmer, E.-M. Pferschy-Wenzig, R. BauerInstitute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Graz, AustriaVietnam is very rich in traditional medicinal knowledge and still 80% of the population is using it in the primary health care system. In our ongoing research on plants used for the treatment of inflammation and cancer, we have recently screened and investigated a series of Vietnamese plants with high activity.From Helicteres hirsuta we isolated the new natural product 4,4'- Sulfinyl - bis - (2-(tert-butyl)-5-methylphenol, as well as 7-O-methylisoscutellarein, 3b-O-acetylbetulinic acid, and simiarenol, which were found in Sterculiaceae for the first time. 4,4'- sulfinyl - bis - (2-(tert-butyl)-5-methylphenol and 3b-O-acetylbetulinic acid showed cytotoxicity in CCRE-CEM and HCT-116 cancer cells [1].From Enhydra fluctuans, the known sesquiterpene lactones enhydrin, fluctuanin, and fluctuadin showed significant cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines and a normal lung fibroblast cell line.Four sesquiterpene derivatives were also isolated from the rhizomes of Stahlianthus involucratus, including the two new natural products 5-hydroperoxylacorafuran and isoacotatarone C, plus the known tatarinowin B and tatarinowin C. Besides tatarinowin C, all showed cytotoxicity. Sphaeranthus africanus has been used in traditional Vietnamese medicine to treat sore throat, and to relieve pain and swelling. A series of carvotacetones from this plant that displayed cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines and showed anti-inflammatory effects. [2,3]. 3-angeloyloxy-5-angeloyloxy-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, 3-angeloyloxy-5-[2?,3?-epoxy-2?-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, 3-angeloyloxy-5-[3?-chloro-2?-hydroxy-2?-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, 3-tigloyloxy-5-angeloyloxy-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, 3-angeloyloxy-5-hydroxy-7-hydroxycarvotacetone were identified together with two diastereomeric carvotacetones (3-angeloyloxy-5-[2>>S,3>>R-dihydroxy-2>>-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone and 3-angeloyloxy-5-[2>>R,3>>R-dihydroxy-2>>-methyl-butanoyloxy]-7-hydroxycarvotacetone, asperglaucide, and chrysoplenol D. Some of them showed very potent anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects with IC50 values in the nM and low uM range.Our findings support the traditional medical application of these plants and their potential for drug lead discovery.

Reverse pharmacology and traditional medicine.B. GrazFoundation Antenna, Geneva, SwitzerlandIn the conventional process of discovering treatments that could be widely recommended, clinical studies are conducted after several years of preclinical research. There is however, a faster track: the approach called reverse pharmacology (or bedside-to-bench). For traditional medicines, population surveys on therapeutic activities and correlation with reported clinical outcome (Retrospective Treatment Outcome -- RTO) can help select treatments with good safety profile and indices of effectiveness, hence accelerate eventual clinical validation.The reverse pharmacology approach has four steps: After an RTO survey, the second step is a dose-response study with humans; the third step evaluates effectiveness through a clinical trial. The fourth step are laboratory studies, which in this case, and contrary to classical drug discovery, are thus post-clinical.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org4020th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL04. Innovative strategies for the efficient isolation of natural products and discovery of potential new leads.E.F. Queiroz, JL. WolfenderInstitut des Sciences Pharmaceutiques de Suisse Occidentale (ISPSO), Section des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Universite de Geneve, SwitzerlandNatural products (NPs) have been a source of inspiration for drug development throughout history. Nature continues to represent a rich source of new molecules with interesting pharmacological properties that could be used as lead compounds for the development of new drugs. Technological development in this field is constantly evolving. New high-throughput screening strategies have been introduced for rapid and efficient evaluation the biological and chemical potential of complex matrices, such as plant extracts. Significant advances in molecular biology afford now the development of more predictable in vitro and in vivo bioassays. The combination of metabolite profiling using molecular networks and bioassays gives the possibility to distinguish between already known bioactive compounds and new molecules directly in crude natural extracts (dereplication)[1] Thus, the targeted isolation of new bioactive products or constituents presenting novel or unusual spectroscopic features can be undertaken. The structural identification of new NPs requires only very small amounts of material (sub milligram) using such approaches. On the other hand, the extensive bioactivity profile characterization of a potential lead requires milligram or tens of milligram amounts. In this case, preparative chromatographic methods for the purification of NPs at large scale are mandatory. At this level, significant improvements for the efficient targeted isolation of given NPs through chromatographic gradient transfer methods have been made [2,3]. The applications, possibilities and limitations of these latest technologies applied to the study plant and fungal metabolites will be illustrated with recent investigations performed in our laboratory.

The Regulatory aspects and challenges for commercialisation of the Natural Products.N. LallPlant and Soil Sciences, University of Pretoria, South AfricaTraditional medicine is an important foundation upon which modern medicine has been built. In these traditional practices, plants have been a crucial resource, owing to their abundance since the dawn of mankind. In modern times, synthetic drugs have become a lucrative alternative; however, plants as a resource remain the indispensable resource from which even synthetic alternatives are derived. Recently, natural medicines have shown increased popularity, not surprisingly when considering the benefits. By combining the knowledge derived from traditional medicinal practices with modern science, the possibilities for drug discovery and use of plants in the treatment of a wide array of conditions seems endless.South Africa has a wealthy supply of plants (about 23 500 species of higher plants) together with a high degree of endemicity (36.6%) in the indigenous South African flora, of which 4000 plant taxa are ethnomedicinally used and approximately 500 species are used in traditional medicine by an estimated 70% South Africans on a regular basis. South Africa has huge potential for identifying novel compounds to treat many diseases. South African plants for various purposes such as infectious diseases, cancer, skin-hyperpigmentation problems, melasma, Periodontal diseases, and for acne problem have been scientifically investigated. Steady progress in evaluating potential medicinal plants for product development with potential in human medicine has been made. Once the medicinal products are developed, the dynamics of various ways for benefitting the people who have been using plants for centuries, will be discussed in the talk.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org4220th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL06. Exploration of Traditional Herbal Knowledge in the South Balkan and East Mediterranean region for the discovery of bioactive natural products.N. AligiannisDepartment of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, GreeceThe geographical and ecological characteristics of the Balkan Peninsula and Mediterranean Sea, along with the historical connection among ethnic groups living in the area, gave rise to the development of a distinct flora and to the uses of common medicinal plants against various ailments. Over the past twenty years, our research group obtain evidence on the importance of collecting, assessing and exploring ethnopharmacological data for the discovery of bioactive natural compounds. As examples, the study of Nicander's \"Theriaca\", verified the use of several plants to treat bite symptoms from venomous animals and information obtained from semi-structured interviews for the wound healing properties of Ficus carica preparations were verified by in-vivo mouse model applications. In parallel, the establishment of a validated analytical chemometrics approach through the elaboration of contemporary chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques (FCPC, HPTLC, LC-HRMS/MS, NMR) along with sophisticated statistical algorithms for the rapid and effective identification of bioactive compounds, prior to their isolation directed us to the development of PEGASUS platform.The aforementioned efforts led tOo join forces with Balkan countries and coordinate the European project EthnoHERBS (H2020-MSCA-RISE) for the sustainable and effective exploitation of SE European traditional knowledge and biodiversity for the development of innovative products based on natural ingredients. Within the scope of project, all ethnobotanical studies from Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Greece, Italia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia, Serbia, Turkey were assessed for archiving in a database herbal preparations used for skin ailments. The aim is to provide an overview of the ethnobotanical knowledge of medicinal plants and traditional medical practices for the treatment of skin disorders in the South Balkan and East Mediterranean region. Initially, the research was focused in Albania, Cyprus, Greece and Turkey. Literature study of ethnobotanical surveys showed that 948 taxa belonging to 417 different genera and 111 different families are used in the treatment of skin related problems. The majority of the plants belong to the families of Asteraceae (11.0%), Lamiaceae (8.5%), Rosaceae (7.1%), Plantaginaceae (4.5%) and Malvaceae (3.5%). Their usage is internal (decoction, infusion etc. ), or external (compress, poultice, ointment etc.) to treat skin related ailments such as wounds. In order to relate this ethnopharmacological knowledge and trace its expansion and diversification through centuries, a comparison of findings was made with the use of the medicinal species mentioned in Dioscorides' \"De Materia Medica\" for skin disorders. This work constitutes the first comparative study performed with ethnobotanical data for skin ailments gathered in the South Balkan and East Mediterranean area. Our findings confirm the primary hypothesis that people in Albania, Cyprus, Greece and Turkey are close related in terms of traditionally using folk medicinal practices. Nevertheless, more field studies conducted, especially in remote places of these regions, can help preserve the traditional medical knowledge, aiming at the discovery of new phytotherapeutics against dermatological diseases.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 4320th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL07. TCM needs TQM: New applications using NMR for standardizing botanical mixtures.R. CooperThe Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR ChinaThere is a need to improve and promote the scientific inquiry on the study and use of botanicals, natural products and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), in order to secure global acceptance. Although there is an enormous history of use of botanical medicines a better understanding of these preparations and formulae within the scientific and international community and a rigorous process is needed. The aim is to study select botanicals and natural products to provide scientific data used for standardization and substantiation of health claims using Total Quality Management (TQM). For example, active compounds found in the botanical extract of the Traditional Chinese Medicine, Sambucus williamsii Hance exhibit protective effects on trabecular bone mass and mechanical strength of cortical bone of ovariectomized rats. The main bioactive compounds were determined as lignan compounds. A novel approach was adapted to standardize and determine quantities of the lignan content in the aqueous alcoholic extract of Sambucus williamsii using spectroscopic methods and provide data to help meet the registration requirements. Using these data, the lignan amount in the extract was calculated. The application of this simple and reliable method can be used to estimate other compound families in complex mixtures or botanical extracts and herbal medicines.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org4420th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL08. Challenges and success in using plants to control internal parasites in animals.JN. EloffPhytomedicine Programme, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, South AfricaHaemonchus contortus is a nematode causing extensive losses in sheep production especially in tropical countries. Strong resistance has developed against current control agents. These agents are expensive or unavailable to poor rural farmers. Rural pastoralists have use many plant extracts to control this parasite. In contrast to external parasites where it is easy to see the efficacy of treatments, it is not easy to see the efficacy of plant extracts with internal parasites. It is possible to collect eggs of the parasite from faeces and keep it alive long enough to determine the treatment effect on egg hatching and on larval development. Because the biological assay is demanding it is not feasible to carry out random screening of large number of plants. It is also not easy to isolate the bioactive molecule(s). Using ethnoveterinary data is the only practical option. Much work has been done in this field. In some cases, the objective was to support traditional use and in other cases it was to find compounds that could be used as nematicidals. Benzimidazoles are active against fungi and nematodes. Some antifungal compounds may also be active against nematodes. It is relatively easy to screen plants for antifungal activity and isolate antifungal compounds that may be active against nematodes. The positive and negative results found with these two approaches will be discussed. The work eventually led to the isolation of agrimol G from Leucosidea sericea leaves with good activity against Haemonchus contortus. Based on electron microscopical studies it has a different mechanism of activity than ivermectin and albendazole, two commercially used nematicidals. The controversy around using ivermectin against the Corona virus will also be discussed.Adamu M, et al."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Enhydra fluctuans', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['cytotoxicity']}, {'scientific_name': 'Helicteres hirsuta', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['cytotoxicity', 'Cytotoxicity']}, {'scientific_name': 'Stahlianthus involucratus', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['cytotoxicity']}, {'scientific_name': 'Sphaeranthus africanus', 'medical_conditions': ['sore throat', 'relieve pain and swelling'], 'medicinal_effects': ['cytotoxicity', 'anti-inflammatory', 'antiproliferative', 'Antiproliferative', 'Anti-inflammatory']}, {'scientific_name': 'Ficus carica', 'medical_conditions': ['bite symptoms', 'wound'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Sambucus williamsii Hance', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['protective effects on trabecular bone mass', 'mechanical strength of cortical bone']}, {'scientific_name': 'Leucosidea sericea', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['activity against Haemonchus contortus']}]}"}]}

The majority of theseproducts have a long history of use, but non-harmonized trade and differences inregulatory policies between countries impact their value chains and lead to concernsover product efficacy, safety and quality. Veronica officinalis L. (common speedwell),a member of Plantaginaceae family, has a long history of use in European traditionalmedicine, mainly in central eastern Europe and the Balkans. However, no specifiedcontrol tests are available either to establish the quality of derived herbal products orfor the discrimination of its most common substitute, V. chamaedrys L. (germanderspeedwell). In this study, we use DNA metabarcoding and high performance liquidchromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to authenticate sixteenV. officinalis herbal products and compare the potential of the two approaches todetect substitution, adulteration and the use of unreported constituents. HPLC-MSshowed high resolution in detecting phytochemical target compounds, but did notenable detection of specific plant species in the products. DNA metabarcoding detectedV. officinalis in only 15% of the products, whereas it detected V. chamaedrys in 62% ofthe products. The results confirm that DNA metabarcoding can be used to test forthe presence of Veronica species, and detect substitution and/or admixture of otherVeronica species, as well as simultaneously detect all other species present. Our resultsconfirm that none of the herbal products contained exactly the species listed on thelabel, and all included substitutes, contaminants or fillers. This study highlights theneed for authentication of raw herbals along the value chain of these products. Anintegrative methodology can assess both the quality of herbal products in terms oftarget compound concentrations and species composition, as well as admixture andsubstitution with other chemical compounds and plants.Keywords: adulteration, DNA metabarcoding, herbal products, HPLC-MS, Veronica chamaedrys, VeronicaofficinalisFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378333fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 2Raclariu et al. DNA Metabarcoding for Authentication of Veronica officinalis ProductsINTRODUCTIONTraditional herbal medicines play an important role in meetinghealthcare needs around the world, and complementary andalternative medicines based on these are gaining in importance inmany industrialized countries as a perceived healthy alternativeto synthetic pharmaceuticals (World Health Organization, 2013).The commercialization of such products is undergoing atransition process from unregulated locally traded products tointernationally traded mass produced herbal pharmaceuticalsand food supplements (Heinrich, 2010; Leonti and Casu,2013). A challenge in ethnopharmacology is to study suchnovel herbal products and their value chains (Heinrich,2010; Atanasov et al., 2015), as these are impacted by non-harmonized regulatory and trade policies (Booker et al., 2012,2016).The regulation of herbal products varies globally andbetween EU member countries, these falling under specificlegislation depending on their intended use, for instance, as food,food supplements, herbal medicines, or homeopathic products.Similar to the United States and Canada, the EU currently doesnot have a centralized marketing authorization procedure forherbal products, but instead provides relevant methodologicalspecifications to guarantee manufacturing quality. The EU alsolacks a central public institution for pharmacovigilance of theherbal products, and the primary legal responsibility for safety ofthe marketed herbal products is delegated to the pharmaceuticalindustry, whereas national pharmacovigilance agencies monitordrug safety.A lack of standards for studies of medicinal plants has beenpreviously identified (cf. Rios and Recio, 2005; Gertsch, 2009)and several authors have advocated a stronger guidance of valuechains to mitigate this shortcoming (Rios et al., 1988; Cos et al.,2006; Verpoorte, 2008). Current quality assessment methods relymainly on morphology and analytical chemistry based methodsdetailed in national or EU pharmacopoeias (EDQM - Councilof Europe, 2014). However, the resolution of these methods ishighly influenced by factors such as the phenotypic plasticity,morphological cryptic taxa, species-specific chemical markers,growing conditions, harvesting process, storage condition, or theextraction procedure (Barnes, 2003; Bickford et al., 2007; Jianget al., 2010; Shaw et al., 2012).In addition to ensuring that herbal products contain theintended ingredients in the right quantities, an importantproblem is the use of substitutes and undeclared fillers (Coghlanet al., 2012, 2015; Newmaster et al., 2013). Misidentification(Saslis-Lagoudakis et al., 2015) or incongruences in thevernacular names of the raw material (Farah et al., 2006;Ouarghidi et al., 2012; Walker and Applequist, 2012; De Boeret al., 2015) can lead to accidental substitution, but rising pricesof raw materials and the high demand for such products alsoprovide an incentive for deliberate adulteration. The use ofunlabelled ingredients presents a serious safety challenge asadverse drug reactions cannot be associated to the product labeland ingredients (Heubl, 2010; Gilbert, 2011). Recent studies ofherbal medicine and herbal food supplement value chains using acombination of phytochemical and metabolomics analyses havefound that adulteration of these products often occurs in thefirst stages of their value chains (Booker et al., 2012, 2014,2016).Veronica officinalis L. (common speedwell) is a popularmedicinal plant in several European countries, especially incentral eastern Europe and the Balkans, and used in herbalmedicine both traditionally and increasingly in commercialherbal products. Veronica L. (Plantaginaceae) is a genusof about 450 species (Albach and Meudt, 2010) occurringover most of the Northern Hemisphere and in many partsof the Southern Hemisphere (Mabberley, 2008). Modernsystematic studies of the genus have focused on molecularphylogenies of several nuclear and plastid markers: the nuclearribosomal internal transcribed spacer, nrITS (Wagstaff andGarnock-Jones, 1998; Albach and Chase, 2001; Albach et al.,2004; Buhk et al., 2015), the plastid regions trnL-F (Albachet al., 2004, 2006; Buhk et al., 2015), ndhF-rpl32 (Sonibareet al., 2014; Albach and Al-Gharaibeh, 2015; Buhk et al.,2015), trnH-psbA (Sonibare et al., 2014; Albach and Al-Gharaibeh, 2015), rps16 intron (Albach and Chase, 2004),rps16-trnK (Sonibare et al., 2014; Albach and Al-Gharaibeh,2015).Ethnopharmacological Importance ofVeronica SpeciesSeveral Veronica species are used in European traditionalmedicine to treat respiratory affections, as an expectorant,an antiscorbutic, a diuretic, and for wound healing (Baytop,1984; Harput et al., 2002a). In Turkey, the aerial parts ofVeronica anagallis-aquatica L. are boiled in milk to obtaina poultice used to alleviate abdominal pain (Kupeli et al.,2005), or used as a bath cure to relieve rheumatic pain(Fujita et al., 1995). In the Valdesi valley of Italy, in thepoorer villages Veronica species are traditionally used as aninexpensive substitute for imported teas and this has beenposed as an explanation of the modern use of Veronicaspecies in recreational teas (Bellia and Pieroni, 2015). Intraditional Chinese medicine V. anagallis-aquatica is used forthe treatment of influenza, hemoptysis, laryngopharyngitis,and hernia (Su et al., 1999). In Europe, V. officinalis isthe best-known and most commonly used species (Table 1).The main ethnopharmacological indications for V. officinalisare inflammatory conditions, rheumatism, stomach ulcers,respiratory ailments (Scarlat et al., 1985; Mocan et al., 2015b), andnervous, cardiovascular and metabolism system disorders (Voglet al., 2013).Phytochemical and PharmacologicalStudiesVeronica species are rich in iridoid glucosides, mainly aucubin,catalpol and benzoic and cinnamic acid esters of catalpol, allcompounds that have previously been investigated for theirbioactivities (Harput et al., 2002a,b, 2014; Saracoglu et al., 2002).Saracoglu and Harput (2012) showed that some iridoid glucosidesof V. anagallis-aquatica, V. persica Poir, and V. thymoidesP.H.Davis subsp. pseudocinerea M.A.Fisch. exhibited cytostaticFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378334fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 3Raclariu et al.

(2002a) showed that V. cymbalaria Bodard,V. hederifolia L., V. pectinata L. var. glandulosa, V. persica andV. polita Fr. possess anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic and radicalscavenging activities. Vogl et al. (2013) showed for the firsttime in vitro anti-inflammatory activity of the extracts preparedfrom V. officinalis. Nikolova (2011) found that V. bellidioidesL., V. kellereri Degen & Urum., V. vindobonensis (M.A.Fisch. )M.A.Fisch., V. beccabunga L., V. rhodopea Degen ex Stoj.& Stef. and V. austriaca L. showed significant antioxidantproperties.Quality Issues of Veronica officinalisHerbal ProductsAs a folk remedy, V. officinalis is used mostly in traditionalmedicine, and no current national pharmacopeia monographsinclude standards for quality control or authentication ofVeronica herbal products. Identification tests currently availableto detect substitutes and adulterants rely on chromatographicmethods, usually as a combination of separate approaches (e.g.,HPLC with TLC-densitometry) or a combination of differentapproaches into a single procedure (e.g., HPLC-UV, HPLC-MSor GC-MC) (European Medicine Agency [EMA], 2006; EDQM -Council of Europe, 2014).All raw materials of V. officinalis used in the marketed herbalproducts are harvested from the spontaneous flora, and sourcedfrom several countries in central eastern Europe and the Balkans.Kathe et al. (2003) and Ichim et al. (2011) cite that the exploitationpressure of wild-harvesting could potentially threaten the species.The limited availability of V. officinalis is a likely driver behindthe widespread substitution with V. chamaedrys L. (germanderspeedwell), an abundant herb of grassland and forest edges,with no proven therapeutic uses Cris,an et al. (2007, 2011).Furthermore, even though their vegetative morphology is clearlydistinct, the flowers of V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys caneasily be confused (Leyel, 1937). Cris,an et al. (2001, 2011)report histological, anatomical and phytochemical charactersthat distinguish V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys and propose arapid differentiation method using thin-layer chromatography(TLC) of species-specific phenyl-propanoic compounds. Theseanalytical methods enable chemical identification of some targetcompounds, but cannot rule out that other Veronica species,or mixtures thereof, might be present in the investigatedproducts. Marketed herbal products are complex formulationsthat are usually highly processed and consist of numerousingredients.DNA Barcoding and MetabarcodingRapid advances in DNA sequencing have enabled cost-effectiveuse of DNA sequences for species identification. Hebert et al. (2003) coined the concept of DNA barcoding as a rapid andaccurate way of species-level identifications using short standardDNA regions. Different combinations of plastid markers (e.g.,rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA) and the nuclear ribosomal internaltranscribed spacer (nrITS) have been proposed as the primarybarcodes for plants, and the current core barcodes are rbcLand matK, supplemented by nrITS (Kress and Erickson, 2007;CBOL Plant Working Group, 2009; China Plant BOL Group,2011; Hollingsworth et al., 2011). Several studies have shownthat about 75-85%, and in some floras over 90%, of plantspecies can be identified to species level using DNA barcoding(Lahaye et al., 2008; Kress et al., 2009, 2010; Chen et al.,2010; Burgess et al., 2011). In taxonomically difficult plantgroups, where hybridization is frequent, or in lineages ofrelatively young age the use of traditional barcodes may notbe reliable (Kress and Erickson, 2007; Fazekas et al., 2009).In such groups the use of low-coverage shotgun sequencingof genomic DNA could resolve relationships and augmentcurrent plant barcodes (Coissac et al., 2016; Hollingsworth et al.,2016).Techen et al.

Box 162,1001 SkopjeGenotoxicity testing is performed to assess the potential ofcompounds to induce genotoxic effects which may cause heritabledamage or lead to cancer in humans. In silico modeling of genotoxic-ity is widely used because the developed models are less expensiveand time-consuming than in vivo and in vitro models [1].As a part of the ongoing research in our laboratory new methodology forclassification of compounds according to genotoxicity is proposed for seriesof thiophene derivatives. These compounds are selected due to their presencein pharmaceuticals and their potential for metabolic activation via CYP450. The modeling of the genotoxicity was performed on experimentallyobtained values for genotoxicity using SOS Chromotest for 150 thio-phenes [2,3]. For the modeling purposes of the compounds in the dataset we calculated a set of PubChem binary fingreprints [4]. The dataset consisting of 880 binary fingerprints was reduced down to 108 fin-gerprints according to their performances in classification of thedataset of analyzed compounds.Classification models were developed using nonlinear projectionalgorithm supervised self-organizing maps [5,6]. The selection of theoptimal parameters and most suitable fingerprints was performed onautomated manner using genetic algorithms [7]. Additionally, usinggenetic algorithms newly developed approach for adjustment of therelative importance of input variables was applied [8]. The quality ofthe models was determinate by the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity,with preference given to models that have greater sensitivity.Using the proposed approach we were able to develop suitable mod-els, with excellent generalization performances which were able tosuccessfully classify most of the samples in the independent test set.The model that accurately classify 78% of tested thiophenes havesensitivity of 60% and specificity of 86%."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Allium cepa', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Vicia faba', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Trifolium repens', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Phaseolus vul-garis', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Phaseolus vulgaris L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

In several chromatographic steps,three flavonoids and three sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) were isolated and identifiedfrom the most active fractions of the ethanol extract. Two STLs, one for which wecreated the trivial name ragusinin, and hemistepsin A are here reported for the firsttime as constituents of the genus Centaurea. All six compounds were screened fortheir effect on several tumor and one normal cell lines. Among them, ragusinin showedthe best bioactivity and high specificity to affect tumor murine SCCVII, human HeLaand Caco-2 cell lines, but not the viability of normal V79 fibroblasts. Due to thesecharacteristics the action of ragusinin was investigated in more detail. Since DNA isthe primary target for many drugs with antibacterial and anticancer activity, we studiedits interaction with ragusinin. Rather moderate binding affinity to DNA excluded it asthe primary target of ragusinin. Due to the possibility of STL interaction with glutathione(GSH), the ubiquitous peptide that traps reactive compounds and other xenobiotics toprevent damage to vital proteins and nucleic acids, its role in deactivation of ragusininwas evaluated. Addition of the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine potentiated the viabilityof HeLa cells, while the addition of GSH inhibitor L-buthionine sulfoximine decreasedit."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Hypericum', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['antifungal']}, {'scientific_name': 'H. hircinum subsp.majus', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['antifungal']}, {'scientific_name': 'Syringa vulgaris L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['pro-inflammatory']}, {'scientific_name': 'Centaurea ragusina L.', 'medical_conditions': ['cancer', 'gastrointestinal and urogenital disorders', 'tumor'], 'medicinal_effects': ['antibacterial']}, {'scientific_name': 'Ajuga laxmannii (Murray) Benth', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['antimicrobial', 'antioxidant', 'anti-inflammatory']}, {'scientific_name': 'Prunus spinosa L.', 'medical_conditions': ['cardiovascular disease'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Ononis natrix subsp. hispanica', 'medical_conditions': ['atherosclerosis'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Centaurea', 'medical_conditions': ['gastrointestinal and urogenital disorders', 'tumor'], 'medicinal_effects': ['antibacterial']}, {'scientific_name': 'Penicillium', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Candida', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Commiphora', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Boswellia', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Aspergillus', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Rhodiola roseaL.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Chelidonium majus L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Ononis natrix', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Veronica officinalis L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Scrophularia lucida L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "From infancy to puberty, serum creatinine concentration uniformly increases, depending on the skeletal muscle development.In the elderly, the kidney concentrating ability is decreased, which results in reduced creatinine clearance. This is due to a decreased urinary creatinine excretion as a result of reduced lean body mass rather than to renal dysfunction. Plasma urea concentration and urinary protein excretion increase with age. In addition to differences in gender specific hormones, differences also exist in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters. Plasma concentrations of amino acids, urea, uric acid and creatinine are higher in males than in females. Clinical chemistry analytes are greatly influenced by diet and drinking. A high-protein diet increases plasma urea, serum cholesterol, and phosphate concentrations. In contrast, starvation, fasting and malnutrition also induce clinically significant changes in analytes concentrations. Long-term starvation entails decreased concentrations of blood protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins, and urea. On the other hand, the concentrations of creatinine and uric acid increase. Urinary excretion of ammonia and creatinine is increased, whereas the excretion of urea, calcium and phosphate is reduced. Due to the decreased skeletal mass, serum concentrations of urea and creatinine as well as creatinine clearance are reduced. Hemolysis can cause an interference factor for the analysis of creatinine. Also, bilirubin can cause false positive results in creatinine determination.ConclusionFrom this data for creatinine, with the usage of the t-test, we can conclude that there are significant differences in results between different age groups and gender, but there is no significance in results for urea for participants with age of 50-65 in both male and female groups.The inter-individual variations for creatinine are 15,64% and for urea are 26,94%. The range of variability in serum creatinine between individuals in this study is between 61,57-100,4 umol/L for male participants and 50,9-82,66 umol/L for female, but according to the kit documentation creatinine levels should be 62-106 umol/L for male and 44-80 umol/L for female. For urea this range is between 2,08-7,64 mmol/L (2,6-6,5 mmol/L by the kit documentation).It is of great importance that physicians be aware of these factors, because the final interpretation of the analyses and decisions on therapeutic procedures based on this interpretation actually lead to the physician's final judgment. In this process, the laboratory should act as a reliable and consistent collaborator.ReferencesHosten, O.A., 1990.

Worldwide urine screening tests use for preliminary re-sults of opiate abuse for employees in the workplace, ath-letes in doping control and etc. (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Lum and Mushlin, 2004). However, existing problem in interpreting the results of opiate urine analysis arises be-cause immunoassays screening tests have high sensitivity but lower specificity because of cross-reactivity with sub-stances other than the drugs in question (Lum and Mush-lin, 2004). Therefore, it is well known that positive opi-ate results may be obtained during drugs of abuse screen-ing related to certain drugs and food intake (EFSA, 2011; Jankovicova et al., 2009; Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Lum and Mushlin, 2004). Seeds of the opium poppy plant are legally sold and widely consumed as food. Morphine and codeine are nat-urally occurring substituent of the poppy plant, Papa-ver somniferum. The opiate content of poppy seeds var-ies greatly and is dependent on the seed origin and meth-od processing (EFSA, 2011; Samano et al., 2015). Due to contamination during harvesting, the seeds can contain morphine and other opiate alkaloids (Lachenmeier et al., 2010). Literature data and our previous case study indi-cate that consummation of both, raw poppy seeds and bak-ing mixtures, induce positive immunoassay test for opiates (Dukic-Cosic et al. 2014; Jankovicova et al., 2009; Sama-no et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2014). However, the time pe-riod during which it is possible to obtain false positive opi-ates results is not yet sufficiently understood.The purpose of this case study was to determine time period of presence of opiates in urine after the consump-tion of product which contain poppy seed using immuno-assay test and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) technique. Materials and methodsFemale participant age between 20 and 25 years with-out previous known history of substance abuse provided written informed consent to participate in this case study. Participant consumed a piece of strudel with poppy seeds from a local bakery in the morning on the first day and collected ad libitum each urine sample during next three days. Urine samples (n=8) were collected 5, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours after strudel ingestion. Specimens were analyzed with the Opiates Test Card (MP Biomed-icals, LLC, California) immunoassay at 300 ng/mL cut-offs, and all positive samples were quantified for morphine and codeine by LC/MS. Urine specimen was prepared us-ing liquid/liquid extraction of opiate by mixture of chloro-form and isopropanol (9 : 1; v/v). Extracts were analyzed by LC/MS technique: separation column Waters Spheri-sorb 5 mm, ODS2, 4.6 x 100 mm; mobile phase: ammo-nium acetate:acetonitrile (80 : 20; v/v), mobile phase flow rate 0.3 mL/min; mass detection range: 100-400 m/z.S3 PP 154328Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 327 - 328 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe screening immunoassay test for opiates (cutoff 300 ng/mL) was positive for all investigated urine samples. These results in accordance with previous studies that pop-py-seed food products, such as poppy-seed strudels, may cause a true-positive immunoassay screening test for opi-ates due to the presence of low, but still detectible, levels of opium alkaloids (Lum and Mushlin, 2004). The morphine content in poppy seeds from around the world is variable (0.1-294 mg/g), and exposure concentrations depend on poppy seed origin, harvesting procedure and the method of poppy seed foodstuffs preparation (Samano et al., 2015; Thevis et al., 2003). Significant reductions in opiate con-tent have been documented after food preparative process-es, with decreased drug concentration shown after wash-ing, soaking, grinding and baking (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Samano et al., 2015). To minimize the number of positive opiate tests resulting from poppy seed consump-tion, cutoff concentration for morphine and codeine raised from 300 to 2,000 ng/mL (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Sa-mano et al., 2015). However, only screening immunoassay test for opiates with lower cutoff (300 ng/mL) are avail-able in our country. In all investigated urine samples, morphine and co-deine concentrations were determined by LC/MS. The following values were obtained for morphine: 0.25, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02, 0.01 and 0.01 mg/L, and codeine 0.07, 0.09, 0.06, 0.02, 0.009, 0.008, 0.001, 0.001 mg/L, re-spectively. The highest measured concentration of mor-phine and codeine was obtained at 5 and 12 hours, respec-tively. This is in agreement with literature data that peak concentrations of morphine and codeine appeared 4-12 hours after consumption of poppy seed (Lachenmeier et al., 2010). However, for interpreting urine opiate results need to know that measured concentrations of morphine and codeine after the consumption of products which con-tain poppy seed are noticeably lower then concentrations of opiates which can be measured in urine of opiate abus-ers. Furthermore, presence of heroin metabolite 6-mono-acetylmorphine can be detected in urine of opiate abusers using LC/MS or GC/MS techniques (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Samano et al., 2015). In contrast to results of this case, the most studies with intake of poppy seeds, raw and cakes, shows that urine samples were negative by 20 hours after consumption (Jankovicova et al., 2009; Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014). Present data show that, even 72 hours after the oral intake of strudel containing poppy seeds, the urinary level of opiate alkaloids can be detectible. Namely, approx-imate detection time of opiates of abuse in urine is up to three days and these data demonstrated that opiates can be detected in urine after consumption poppy seed stru-del during the same time period as in users of psychoactive substances. Thevis et al. (2003) also demonstrated positive opiate urine at 48 h after consumption a typical poppy seed cake with high morphine content (151.6 mg/kg). The con-sumption of poppy seed products in those out-of-competi-tion time spaces might be considered as non problematic, but the long length of stay of opiates in urine samples can lead to positive doping results in competition tests up to three days after oral intake of cakes with poppy seeds (The-vis et al., 2003; Lachenmeier et al., 2010). ConclusionThe results of the present case study support previous findings and confirm that opiates can be detected in urine after consumption popular poppy seed strudel. However, these data indicates that time period of presence of opiates in urine can be prolonged after consumption of this prod-uct. This finding should be taken into account in routine testing of employees in the workplace, members of the mil-itary, students in schools, as well as athletes.

Vitamin C which is contained in the cabbage has antioxidant effect, it protects the human body from stress, and it is a cofactor in several vital enzymat-ic reactions (Cauniietal, 2010). According to Gjorgjev et al. (2008), the content of Ca and P in cabbage is in pro-portion that contributes to a better use of these micronu-trients for growth and development of the organism. There are also the following elements: K, Na and Cl, and the trace elements: Cu, Zn, Co and Mn (Lambasa, 2006). Cab-bage contains a significant amount of aromatic substanc-es and organic acids, which give the typical taste and smell (Gjorgjev et al., 2008). Fresh cabbage has healing proper-ties when treating stomach ulcer, protects mucous mem-branes, strengthens the immune system against many dis-eases, increases hemoglobin in the blood and cures anemia, affect the normalization of blood pressure, cures rheuma-tism, reduces the risk of colon hose etc (Vlahovic, 1999).During the drying process on appropriate temperature, free water evaporates which preserves the stability of the product from microbiological and chemical aspect. The content of water in the dried vegetables ranges from 8 to 12%. At the same time, it the concentration of sugars and other ingredients is increased (Katalinic, 2006)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Papa-ver somniferum', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Brassica oleracea var.

Inspired by the \"signatura rerum\" principle and an apparent ancientfolk tradition, various indications were given, such as anti-jaundice and cholagogue,pain-relieving, and quite often mentioned--ophthalmological problems. Central andEastern European folk medicine has always been using this herb extensively. In thisregion, the plant is known under many unique vernacular names, especially in Slavoniclanguages, associated or not with old Greek relation to \"chelidon\"--the swallow. Typicallyfor Papaveroidae subfamily, yellow-colored latex is produced in abundance and leaksintensely upon injury. Major pharmacologically relevant components, most of which werefirst isolated over a century ago, are isoquinoline alkaloids--berberine, chelerythrine,chelidonine, coptisine, sanguinarine. Modern pharmacology took interest in this herbbut it has not ended up in gaining an officially approved and evidence-based herbalmedicine status. On the contrary, the number of relevant studies and publicationstended to drop. Recently, some controversial reports and sometimes insufficientlyproven studies appeared, suggesting anticancer properties. Anticancer potential wasin line with anecdotical knowledge spread in East European countries, however, in theabsence of directly-acting cytostatic compounds, some other mechanisms might beinvolved. Other properties that could boost the interest in this herb are antimicrobialand antiviral activities. Being a common synanthropic weed or ruderal plant, C. majusspreads in all temperate Eurasia and acclimates well to North America. Little is knownabout the natural variation of bioactive metabolites, including several aforementionedisoquinoline alkaloids. In this review, we put together older and recent literature dataon phytochemistry, pharmacology, and clinical studies on C. majus aiming at a criticalevaluation of state-of-the-art from the viewpoint of historical and folk indications.

Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majusINTRODUCTION\"No less extraordinary is the property of the herb Celandine;which, it is said, if any man shall have this herb, with the heartof a Mole, he shall overcome all his enemies, all matters in suit,and shall put away all debate,\" and \"if before named herb beput upon the head of a sick man, if he shall die, he shall singanon with a loud voice, if not, he shall weep\"; and \"it bringeththe business begun to an end,\" so wrote Albertus Magnus inthirteenth century A.D. (Best and Brightman, 1999). Nowadays,mankind would definitely benefit from such a miraculousremedy. Unfortunately, such claims about Chelidonium majusL.--the Greater Celandine, have not been verified according tothe modern evidence-based approach (but no data on rigoroustesting toward such properties actually exist in the literature).However, through years of investigations, many other propertiesascribed to this inconspicuous but characteristic plant have beenconfirmed or re-discovered. Several others could not be positivelyconfirmed. Despite the widespread use in folk medicine and inofficial phytotherapy, both in Europe and in Traditional ChineseMedicine, the celandine herb did not join themost popular herbalremedies such as chamomile, valerian, St. John's wort or ginseng.It has been listed in pharmacopeias and sold in pharmaciesin parallel to the spontaneous collection by people seekingdrugs against gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, infections, butespecially against warts and any skin protuberances. This wasthe reason to combine the available historical and ethnobotanicaldata with the state-of-the art in pharmacology of C. majus andits components in the present review (Supplementary Figure 1).To date, only a couple of papers have provided review ofpharmacological and phytochemical knowledge with the EMAassessment report from 2011 (European Medicines Agency,2011) and the review (Gilca et al., 2010), being the mostrecent and comprehensive ones. Biswas (2013) has publisheda short review with overview of selected bioactivities butonly covering a fraction of available literature and suggestingfuture directions of research. Similar approach to review theC. majus properties was used by Arora and Sharma (2013) whosummarized some activities based on selected literature andincluded pharmacognostic characteristics. Gilca et al. (2010) hasclassified the pharmacological evidence into the categories relatedto traditional usage, also from the viewpoint of the TCM, such asanti-infectious, spasmolytic, gastric and hepatic, and anticancer.They also listed traditional indications that had not beenconfirmed by modern research, such as diuretic, anti-edema,expectorant and antitussive, pulmonary, and ophthalmologicaldiseases. Some current information is also available in herbalbooks and compendia (Wichtl, 2004) or in the Internet. The lattersource is of course difficult to verify.Therefore, we chose to include a possibly high number ofavailable literature, by selecting records from database search(PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar) with the term \"chelidonium\"or \"celandine\" and manually eliminating papers pertaining tofield botany, ecology and other aspects not relevant to medicinaluse of this plant. Some references that have been reviewed earlier(e.g., in Colombo and Bosisio, 1996) were also not cited directlyif the information was redundant. Some information about thehistorical applications and folk medicine in Central and EasternEurope were obtained from sources available in local libraries. Inparticular, we describe the phytochemical composition of variousparts of the plant, the methods used for obtaining extracts andanalysis of the herbal material. Further, we critically summarizethe most credible research on bioactivity and clinical efficacy ofvarious products and substances from C. majus. In addition, thehighly debated and controversial issue of the patented, apparentlysemi-synthetic drug NSC-631570 (Ukrain R(c)) promotedmainly asa cancer cure was discussed (Ernst and Schmidt, 2005). With thisreview, we hope to encourage more research and attract interestto this quite common but not always adequately respected weed.BOTANICAL DESCRIPTIONC. majus L. (Papaveraceae1) is a short-lived hemicryptophyte. Ithas up to 1m high stem, branched and sparsely pubescent. Thealternately placed leaves are light bluish at the bottom and greenat the top. The basal leaves are long-petioled, with the obovatedin contour, pinnatosected leaflets with 5-7 lobed segments. Theapical leaves are short-petioled, with 3-lobed leaflet. From Aprilto October the plant produces umbellate inflorescences with 2-6 flowers, which have 4 bright yellow petals and two whitish,early dropping sepals. The fruit is an elongated (3 cm), pod-shaped, multiseeded capsule, dehiscent with two valves. Theseeds are shiny, ovate and dark brown or black, with elaiosomes.The underground part is a short tap root with numerous andelongated lateral roots. The whole plant contains yellow to orangelatex.C. majus grows in the lowlands and foothills in leafy forests,in brushwood, parks, gardens, on the roadsides and aroundbuildings. It prefers moist soils rich in nitrogen and organicmatter (Zarzycki et al., 2002).Distribution AreaC. majus is native in Europe, western and central part of Asiaand in northern Africa. It occurs from Portugal in the West, toCentral, Eastern to Northern Europe. The Asian range coversTurkey, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Caucasus, and Siberia. InNorth America it is an introduced plant.Taxonomy and NomenclatureUntil the mid-twentieth century the genus Chelidonium L.was monotypic with C. majus L. as the only species. In 1982Krahulcowa based on cytotaxonomic study of C. majus L.sensu lato, proposed to divide the genus into two microspecies.She proposed C. majus L. (2n = 12) distributed in Europe,Siberia, and China and a new species C. asiaticum (Hara)Krahulcova (2n = 10), an East Asian vicariant (Krahulcova,1982). Aside from the difference in chromosome numbers anddistribution area, C. asiaticum slightly differs morphologicallyfrom C. majus. It is more hairy, with narrower and sharper leaflobes. Within C. majus she distinguished European C. majus L.subsp. majus with more laciniate lobes of leaves, and C. majus.1The Plant List.

(Krahulcova, 1982) Name of the genus derives from Greek(khelidonion) with chelidon (khelidon) meaning swallow (a bird)for the plant usually blooms simultaneously with arrival of thesebirds. The specific epithetmajus in Latin means bigger.Common English name: Greater celandine.The name celandine originates from Medieval Latin wordcelidonia, a phonetic variant of Latin chelidonia, which wasrecorded by Pliny. Similarly, the German name, Schollkraut,comes from Schellkraut (Bauhin, 1651), which is derived fromLatin-Greek chelidonium (Waniakowa, 2015).Common and Folk Names in Some EuropeanLanguagesAlbanian--latrapeci, bar saraleku; Belarussian--padtynnik,barodaunik (wart herb); Bosnian--rosopas; Bulgarian--zmiyskomlako; Croatian--zmijino mlijeko, rosopas; Czech--vlastovicVnik, celadona, celduneV, cen dalie, dravnicovina,hadi mlicV, krkavnik; Dutch--stinkende gouwe; English--Tetterwort, devils's milk, rock poppy; French--grandechelidoine Eclair, herbe aux boucs, herbe a l'hirondelle;German--Schollkraut, Gilbkraut, Goldwurz, Schwalbenkraut,Warzenkraut; Italian--celidonia, cinerognola, Montenegrin--rusopas, rusa; Polish--glistnik jaskolcze-ziele, celidonia,cyndalia, cencylja, glistewnik, glis'nik, niebospad, zloty groszek,zlotnik, zolte ziele, zolte kwiatki, roztopas'c'; Ukrainian--hladyshnyk, hnystnyk, zhovtyi molochay, smetannyk, chystotil;Romanian: rostopascaV; Russian--chistotel; Rusyn--rostopast';Serbian--rusopas, rusa, rusomacVa; Spanish--Golondrinera,Hierba de las verrugas (wart herb).Chelidonium majus IN FOLK MEDICINEHistory of UsageC. majus has been known as medicinal species since the veryAntiquity. Medicinal properties of C. majus were describedby Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder in the first century AD.Dioscorides in De Materia Medica states that celandine beginsto blossom when the swallows arrive and withers when theydepart. He also refers to a lore saying that swallows restore sightto their blind nestlings with use of celandine (Osbaldeston andWood, 2000). Pliny the Elder repeats these accounts in NaturalisHistoriae (Jones, 1966).The foremost medicinal use of celandine, described since theancient times until the sixteenth century, was treating visualimpairment and eye diseases. For such conditions, Dioscoridesadvised to use herb juice, boiled with honey in a brass vessel.The juice could also be dried in the shade and the resulting smallpellets were ingredients of other medicinal products. Accordingto Dioscurides celandine soaked in wine together with anisefruits was helpful in treating jaundice and dermatologic disorderssuch as herpes. Besides, chewing on a root relieved toothache(Osbaldeston and Wood, 2000). Pliny advised a kind of eyelotion, which takes its name, chelidonia, from the name of theplant (Jones, 1966).Celandine was an admired medicinal plant during the MiddleAges, mostly used to cure eye diseases, for throat cleansing,treatment of ulcers and skin eczema as well as against colicand jaundice (Mayer et al., 2003). In 1080, French monkand physician Odo Magdunensis wrote De viribus herbarum,also known as Macer floridus, a botanical poem describingmedical effects of 77 plants. One of the chapters of M.floridus deals with medicinal application of celandine in \"visualimpairment as well as skin and liver conditions\" (Mayer et al.,2003). Hildegard of Bingen wrote about celandine in her workLiber subtilitatum diversarum naturarum creaturarum createdduring 1150-1160A.D. and finally published in 1533. Hildegardrecommended celandine juice to enhance sight and juice mixedwith tallow as a cure for skin ulcer (Mayer et al., 2003).Moreover, celandine would be a strong aphrodisiacum, butcausing infertility on ladies. Breathing the smell of the plant byspouses prevents arguments. Celandine was also recommendedby to treat jaundice and against hair overgrowth (Czekan'ski,2007).Since the sixteenth century, according to Paracelsus'ssignature doctrine, celandine was used to treat jaundice andliver diseases (Rostanski, 1997). C. majus was described incomprehensive botanical medical works of scholars such as:Joannes Minoritanus, Marcello Vergili, Hieronymus Bock,Leonhard Fuchs, Pierandrea Matthioli, and Adam Lonicer.The authors refer to antique sources and recommend usingcelandine to treat eye and skin conditions. According to Lonicer,to cure various dermatologic diseases, known in those days as\"leprosy,\" the juice of the root of celandine had to be applied onthe skin, conjointly with drinking the juice mixed with syrup ofcommon fumitory (Fumaria officinalis) twice a day for 9 days(Mayer et al., 2003). At the turn of the sixteenth and seventeenthcentury two large works on herbs and their applications werewritten in Poland. The first is Herbarz Polski by Marcin ofUrz ,edowo, printed in 1595 and the second is Herbal by SimonSyrenius, published in 1613. Marcin of Urz ,edowo described,based on works of Dioscorides, uses of celandine to treat eyediseases, jaundice, wounds, toothache, and colic. To cure sightimpairment, herb juice boiled with honey or pellets made ofjuice dried in shade should be used. Cataract, on the other hand,should be treated with juice draining from a broken stem orroot of the plant. In case of jaundice, root of celandine shouldbe boiled in white wine and the decoction should be drunk fora few days. The crashed root with wine was drunk to treat colicand applied on wounds. Applying a piece of root of celandine toan aching tooth, relieved the pain (Marcin of Urz ,edowo, 1595).Simon Syrenius, described celandine-based recipes used ineye diseases. The main ingredient of such medicines is freshcelandine juice. As one of the few authors, Syrenius consideredthe juice irritative and therefore recommended mixing it withsmall amounts of vinegar, milk, or rose water. He also adviseddrinking a decoction of celandine roots cooked in wine withanise or a mixture of powdered root with vinegar before bedtimeto treat jaundice, colic, and stomach ache. In case of toothachehe advised to rub teeth with powdered root with vinegar. Bodyulcers and scabs on the head skin can be cured with a salve ofpowdered rootmixedwith pork fat and vinegar.

R. rosea extract has a stimulatingeffect on the CNS, suggesting potential benefits on cognitive functions, memory,learning, and attention. The reproducible efficacy and quality of preparations ofthe underground parts of R. rosea depend on the highly variable content of theactive markers, salidroside and rosavin, which affect the quality of HMP and dietarysupplements. However, it is not clear which analytical markers are important forassessing the efficacy of R. rosea preparations intended for use in aging-induced mildcognitive disorders, such as attenuated memory, attention, and learning. Furthermore,the activity of various commercial R. rosea extracts has not been correlated with theircontent. Here, the biological activities of salidroside, rosavin, and seven commercialextracts of underground parts of R. rosea were assessed using a synaptic model ofmemory: long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in hippocampus slices.A high degree of variation in the content of all active markers was observed. Oneextract from China lacked rosavin, and there was even variation in the extracts fromthe Altai geographic region. In vitro, rosavin, salidroside and all tested R. rosea extractspotentiated electric stimulation of an intra-hippocampal electric circuit, which resultedin higher responses of the pyramidal cells in isolated hippocampus slices. Rosavinwas more active at higher concentrations than salidroside; while, salidroside was moreeffective at lower concentrations. The highest content of both active markers wasfound in the extracts that were active at the lowest concentrations tested; while, someextracts contained some other compounds that presumably reduced the efficacy dueto antagonistic interactions.

[Crassulaceae, syn. Sedum rhodiola - DC. Sedumrosea - (L.) Scop cop, known as roseroot, rosenroot, goldenroot, arctic root, orpin rose, rhodiole rougeatre] (Currier andAmpong-Nyarko, 2015) has a long history as a valuable medicinalplant and has appeared in the Materia Medica of severalEuropean countries (Panossian et al., 2010). Rhodiola rosea L.roots and rhizome extracts are active ingredients in adaptogenicherbal medicinal products (HMP) and dietary supplements fortemporary relief of symptoms of stress, such as fatigue andweakness (Panossian and Wagner, 2005; Panossian and Wikman,2009, 2010, 2014; EFSA, 2010; Panossian et al., 2010; EuropeanMedicine Authority [EMA], 2011). A growing body of evidencehas indicated the extract's potential use in the prevention andtreatment of stress- and age-related impairments of cognitivefunctions and mental disorders (Panossian et al., 2010, 2014;Panossian, 2013; Panossian and Gerbarg, 2016; Amsterdam andPanossian, 2016; Nabavi et al., 2016). The stimulating effects ofR. rosea on the CNS were demonstrated long ago and suggestedthere were potential benefits on cognitive functions, memory,learning, and attention (Saratikov et al., 1965, 1978; Marina andAlekseeva, 1968; Kurkin and Zapesochnaya, 1986; Petkov et al.,1986; Marina et al., 1994; Saratikov and Krasnov, 2004). An activecompound, named rhodioloside was isolated and identified assalidroside (Aksenova et al., 1968; Saratikov et al., 1968). A pilotstudy of rhodioloside (syn. salidroside) in 46 healthy humanvolunteers showed that 2.5 mg salidroside increased attentionin cognitive tests 1 h after a single dose was administeredin 83% of subjects, compared with 54% of volunteers whowere administered placebo (Aksenova et al., 1968). Furtherstudies provided evidence that R. rosea and salidroside exhibitneuroprotective activity (Qu et al., 2009; Panossian et al., 2010,2012; Jacob et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013), suggesting they maybe effective in treating neurodegenerative disorders, such asAlzheimer's disease (Nabavi et al., 2016).Along with salidroside and its aglycone tyrosol (Figure 1),cinnamyl alcohol, glycosides, and rosavins (collective nameof rosavin, rosarin, and rosin) also exhibited stress-protective(Barnaulov et al., 1986), stimulating, and neurotropic activities inrodents; reduced sleep induced by barbital, hexanal, and chloralhydrate in mice (Sokolov et al., 1985, 1990); increased locomotoractivity in mice (Sokolov et al., 1990); and induced anti-depressant-like effects in animal models of depression (Panossianet al., 2008). Salidroside is common for all species of Rhodiola,while phenylpropanoids, rosavin, rosarin, and rosin are specificonly for R. rosea and R. sachalinensis (Kurkin et al., 1985;Nakamura et al., 2007; Booker et al., 2016b). Many publicationshave reported on the neuroprotective and neurotropic activityof salidroside (Sokolov et al., 1985, 1990; Barnaulov et al., 1986;Panossian et al., 2008; Cifani et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2013); while,there is limited evidence supporting the importance of rosavin,the major active marker (Sokolov et al., 1985, 1990; Panossianet al., 2008; Cifani et al., 2010; Marchev et al., 2017)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Rhodiola rosea L.', 'medical_conditions': ['stress', 'fatigue', 'weakness', 'mental disorders', 'stress- and age-related impairments of cognitivefunctions'], 'medicinal_effects': ['adaptogenic']}, {'scientific_name': 'R. rosea', 'medical_conditions': ['aging-induced mildcognitive disorders', 'neurodegenerative disorders', \"Alzheimer's disease\"], 'medicinal_effects': ['stimulatingeffect on the CNS', 'cognitive functions, memory,learning, and attention', 'attenuated memory, attention, and learning', 'stimulating', 'CNS']}, {'scientific_name': 'Rhodiola rosea', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'B. serrata', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Commiphoramukul', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Commiphora wightii', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Rhodiolarosea L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Rhodiola', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Sedum rhodiola - DC.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Sedumrosea - (L.)

Thelargest genera are Gentiana (360 species), Gentianella (250 species),Swertia (135 species), Centaurium (50 species). At the same time thesegenera are pharmacgnostically most interesting.The Gentianaceae species are cosmopolitan and are distributedthroughout the world, mainly at the mountains of northern hemisp-here, in temperate and arctic region. Besides, they can be found athigh mountains of tropic regions and Ands, as well as in New Zeland,Tasmania, south Australia, and in Africa, although in these regions theyare not abundant.In European flora 9 genera belonging to family Gentianaceae are li-sted. As far as pharmacognosy and chemotaxonomy is concerned themost important genera are: Gentiana and Gentianella, containing 51species classified into 11 sections, Centaurium (12 species, 4 sections),as well as two members of genus Swertia.The area of central Balkans (Montenegro, Macedonia, Bulgaria and Ser-bia) is inhabited by 4 members of genus Centaurium classified in twosections, 23 species of Gentiana and Gentianella (seven sections) andtwo species of Swertia (one section).It is well known that these genera synthesize xanthones, secoiridoidsand flavone-C-glucosides. as main secondary metabolites The factthat xanthones are not widespread in plant world but are the mostabundant in Gentianaceae and Guttiferae families, gives them impor-tant role as chemotaxonomic markers (especially for these two fami-lies). Hitherto investigation of xantone distribution in Gentianaceaewas mostly focused on genera Centaurium, Gentiana, Gentianella andSwertia.The substitution pattern of xanthones and the types of substituents,are rather characteristics for particular genus. For example, xanthone-O-glycosides are chemotaxonomically important in genus Gentiana.The structure investigation of saccharide units bonded to xanthonesin Gentiana, Gentianella, Gentianopsis and Swertia pointed out somedifferences among the genera.The active principles of Gentianceae are xanthone, flavonoids and se-coiridoids, exhibiting various interesting biological activities whichmakes these family very important from pharmacognostic point of view.In this lecture the results of our investigations regarding secondarymetabolites of the species from central Balkans belonging to familyGentianceae will be presented.ApproAchesin phArMAcognosY reseArchGjose Stefkov, Svetlana KulevanovaInstitute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University\"Ss. Cyril and Methodius\", Skopje, R. MacedoniaPharmacognosy research areas are continuing to expand, and now inc-lude aspects of cell and molecular biology in relation to natural pro-ducts (NP), ethnobotany and phytotherapy, in addition to the moretraditional analytical method development and phytochemistry.The Institute of Pharmacognosy (IP), has undergone significant changein recent years and today represents a highly interdisciplinary educa-tional-scientific entity. The systematic scientific approach offers ourpharmacognosy group attractive and diverse areas of research, including:1. Phytochemistry, whereas the long experience in extraction techni-ques, excellent laboratory facilities equipped with preparative HPLCs,GC/FID/MS and LC-MS enables our research group an insight into thechemical composition of many wild growing domestic medicinal andaromatic plants (MAPs) with a focus on flavonoids, phenolic acid, phe-nil-ethanoids, triterpen saponosides, alkaloids, therpenoids and es-sential oils.2. The microscopic evaluation and species verification of MAPs are re-gularly conducted at IP, as well as microscopic research studies onMAPs (Sideritis spp. ; Eringium spp.) deficent in such data.3. Development and use of analytical methods for quality control ofNP from the marketplace (Tribulus terrestris, Poppy, Liquorice) is animportant part of our routine activities.4. The study of the medicinal properties of NP, for the purposes ofdrug discovery and understanding mechanism of action comprises se-veral steps. A typical protocol to isolate a pure chemical agent fromnatural origin is bioassay-guided fractionation, meaning step-by-stepseparation of extracted components based on differences in their phy-sicochemical properties, and assessing the biological activity. The end-goal of the work is to identify which one(s) of the scores or hundredsof compounds are responsible for the observed in vitro activity, isola-tion of a target substance and elucidation of its chemical structure. Invitro assays are therefore used to identify chemical components ofthe crude drug that may rationally be expected to have a given phar-macological effect in humans. Seven flavonoids were identified in themost bioactive fraction of the extract of Teucrium polium that showeda distinct insulinotropic effect on INS-1E cells (in vitro assay for as-sessing antidiabetic properties). The final effect of any extract can bea product of the interactions between the constituents and the ef-fect of each constituent on its own. To effectively study the existenceand affect of such interactions, scientific studies must examine the ef-fect that multiple constituents. All flavonoids from the Teucrium ex-tract were also studied separately and showed a less significantinsulinotropic effect on INS-1E cells. Additionally, different antimi-crobial and antioxidant (DPPH, radical scavenging) test are appliedwith purpose of assessing these activities in many aromatic plants andspices, especially in NP with potential use as food preservatives (ex-tracts from Pine, Juniper, Sage, Oregano, Mountain tea).In vitro activity does not necessarily translate to activity in humans orother living systems. Hepatoprotective and antidiabetic in vivo testingof characterized plant extracts (Teucrium spp., Vaccinium spp., Cen-taurium erythrea, Arctostaphylos uva ursi, ect) in normal and SZT dia-betic rats were conducted, revealing slightly different results thanthose obtained in vitro.177fifth congress of phArMAcY of MAcedoniA With internAtionAl pArticipAtionMacedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANTS oral presentations5. The assessment of the safety and toxicity of any extract, crude drugformulation or NP is obligation before approaching clinical trials onhumans. Within our in vivo experiments, evaluation of biochemicalmarkers (hepatic and renal enzymes) as well as the histomorphologicalexamination of the vital organs are performed, thus having an insightinto safety of the tested extract/NP.6. IP's phytotherapy research program lays its future focus on incor-porating NP into intelligent carriers as a part of its.7. The ethnopharmacology knowledge of the pharmacological quali-ties and use of traditional medicinal remedies, its holistic and syste-matic approach, can serve as an innovative and powerful discoveryengine for newer, safer and affordable medicines. Collecting ethnop-haramcological data from domestic folk's medicine, have been a con-tinuing project, carried out by IP together with Students ResearchAssociation. Another experience shows that utilizing the fact thatmany bitter herbs are traditionally applied as antidiabetics and com-bining this fact with the chemotaxonomy data, we have obtained ex-cellent choice of Centaurium erythrea (bitter plant withchemotaxonomical similarity with Swertia chiriata-traditionally usedantidiabetic herb in India and Japan).8. Molecular study and manipulation of genetic biosynthetic pathwaysfor the purpose of enhancing the production of natural compounds isin inclination. Chemical synthesis of NP can be extremely difficult andexpensive, and isolation from their natural sources is often low yiel-ding. Nowadays, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology offer analternative approach, as the tools for engineering microbes are furtherdeveloped. We have modified the existing ergosterol metabolic path-way into the genetically tractable host system Saccharomices cerevi-siae that showed high capacity for production of the endogenousisoprene precursors as well as different classes of terpenes from ine-xpensive sugar-based carbon starting materials. Using these strainswe expressed one monoterpene and one sesquiterpene synthase fromtwo Salvia species. Besides gene-mining and gene-mapping, employingmolecular research in many studies is inevitably nowadays. Molecularcharacterization of MAPs through molecular markers is important forresolving taxonomic problems (Sideritis raeseri/ S.scardica/ S.syriaca),and is integral part of the data needed in the Genebank conservationprogram (Origanum vulgare, Salvia off.) as well as guide through bree-ding program (Papaver somniferum).9. Enhanced practices and breeding programs for specific agriculturalpurposes and production of NP. There is ongoing long-term project fo-cused on poppy alkaloids enclosing a breeding program based on bo-tanical, phytochemical and molecular markers;10. The world is facing extend species extinction due to habitat lossand overharvesting. Along with the species, traditional knowledge ofmedicinal practices is fast disappearing as well. In the domain of pro-tection/conservation of biodiversity, IP is having one of the crucialroles in founding the National Gene Bank, maintaining and managingthe ex situ MAPs collection. As species face loss of habitat or over-harvesting, there have been new issues to deal with in sourcing crudedrugs. These include developing sustainable collection practices (Vac-cinium spp., Sideritis spp. ), developing farming practices (Sideritis rae-seri, Poppy). Promoting organic harvesting has been enduringoccupation of IP, encompasing mapping and resource assessment ofMAPs (Osogovo Mtn. Blueberries study) as well as MAPs chemical cha-racterization as additional qualities in this value added system. Also IPhas a long-standing commitment for chemical characterization of allendemic plants of R.M.ISTRAzhUVAChKI PRISTAPIVO FARMAKOGNOzIJATAGjoshe Stefkov, Svetlana KulevanovaInstitut za Farmakognozija, Farmatsevtski Fakultet, Univerzitet,,Sv.

Thedistinction between the two is rather simple andarbitrary: fats are more or less solid at roomtemperate, while oils are liquids. A fat on a summerday in Humboldt County may be an oil in Redding.An important chemical consideration in vegetable oilsis the degree of saturation of chemical bonds in thefatty acids. The more double bonds, the more likely itis that the oil will dry to a waterproof film. Less doublebonding means that the oil will remain a liquid for along period of time after exposure to air. The ability ofa fixed oil to absorb iodine correlates directly with itsdrying properties. The higher the number of iodineions incorporated into the positions of double bondsalong the fatty acid chain, the more likely it is that theoil will oxidize to an elastic film. This index is knownas the iodine number. It is the number of grams ofiodine absorbed by 100 grams of fat. The range iniodine numbers is about 7 to 200+.IODINE NUMBERS OF FIXED OILSFixed Oil Iodine NumberLinseed oil 165-204Tung oil 160-175Soybean oil 137-143Safflower oil 140-150Sunflower oil 119-135Corn oil 111-135Cottonseed oil 108-110Canola oil 94-105Sesame oil 103-108Rapeseed oil 94-102Peanut oil 84-100Caster oil 81-89Olive oil 78-88Palm oil 51-77Cacao butter 32-41Palm kernel oil 13-17Coconut oil 7-10Source: Schery (1972) and Simpson & Ogorzaly (1995)DRYING CAPACITY OF FIXED OILSNondrying oils have little or no linoleic or linolenicacid and a low iodine number (less than 100).Examples include: palm oil, peanut oil, olive oil, castoroil, rapeseed oil, almond oil, avocado oil, cacao butter,cashew oil.Semi-drying oils lack appreciable amounts oflinolenic acid, often are rich in linoleic acid, and haveintermediate iodine numbers (100-130). Examplesinclude: cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil,croton oil, corn oil.Drying oils are high in both linoleic and linolenicacids and have high iodine numbers (over 130).Examples include: linseed oil, soybean oil, tung nutoil, hemp seed oil, poppy seed oil, safflower oil, perillaoil, Para rubber oil.Source: Schery (1972) and Simpson & Ogorzaly (1995)SATURATION OF EDIBLE OILSThis feature of the degree to which vegetable oils aresaturated carries over into dietary concerns. Saturatedfats and oils have a hydrogen atom bonded to eachcarbon atom of its molecule. If there is one unbondedsite, the fat or oil is mono-unsaturated; if there areseveral, it is poly-unsaturated. Saturated fats/oilscome mostly from consuming animal products (meat,milk, butter, and cheese), but they also come fromthe \"tropical oils,\" such as coconut, cocoa, and palm.Common examples of monounsaturated oils includeolive, avocado, peanut, and canola. Polyunsaturatedfats and oils may be further subdivided into omega-3'sthat come from flax, seafood, and lean meat; andomega-6's that come primarily from various fruits andseeds.EXTRACTION AND PROCESSINGA variety of both tropical and temperate plants yieldfixed oils. While vegetable oils are found present invarious plant organs, most of the important ones arefound in seeds. They are extracted in much the sameway that we get essential oils out of a plant. The seedcoat is removed and the interior reduced to a finemeal. The oil is removed by a solvent or by expressingit under pressure. It is then filtered and often purifiedfurther. Higher grades of fixed oils go into foodproducts; the lower grades have a variety of industrialuses. The oils may also be bleached and deodorized.SURVEY OF FIXED OIL PLANTSSoybean oil (Glycine max). The soybean, native toeastern Asia, is one of our most ancient oil sources. Itwas one of the five \"sacred grains\" of China. The oilcontent is 13-25%. Soybean oil is used in margarine,shortening, salad oils, whipped toppings, and icings.Its industrial uses include paint, linoleum, printing ink,soap, candles, insecticides, disinfectants, cosmetics,and plastics.Coconut oil (Cocos nucifera). The oil is expressedfrom copra, the dried coconut flesh. The oil content ishigh, 65-70%. The refined oil is used in foods,especially margarines. Lower grades are found insoaps, cosmetics, salves, shaving creams, shampoos,and as an illuminant.Oil palms. Two other palms are also importantsources of fixed oils. The African oil palm (Elaeisguineensis) bears fruit after about 4 or 5 years. Theyare cut from or knocked off the tree and thenprocessed quickly to keep naturally occurring enzymesfrom destroying the oil. The fleshy meso-carp yields45-55% oil used in margarine, cooking fats, soaps,and candles. Taxi cabs in some tropical cities run onpalm oil. A different fixed oil is found in theendosperm of the seed (palm kernel oil). It ischemically similar to coconut oil and is used in icecreams, mayonnaise, toilet soaps, and detergents.The endosperm is about 50% oil. The cake thatremains after expressing the palm oils is used inlivestock food. This plant has the highest yield of oil ofany crop (3475 kg per hectare per year).The American oil palm (Elaeis oleifera) appears to benative to Central and South America. It is closelyrelated to the African oil palm and the two hybridizefreely. It is not as important a source of fixed oil.Canola oil (Brassica spp.). There is no canola plantgrowing out there. The name derives from theCanadian Oil Low Acid research project that developedit in the 1960's from rapeseed oil. Some cultivars arehigh in toxic erucic acid. These oils are used inindustry, often as lubricants. The strains that are lowin erucic acid were approved by the United StatesFood and Drug Administration in 1985 as a food.Canola low has a long shelf life.-147-Meadowfoam oil (Limnanthes spp.). Variousspecies of meadowfoam are native to valleygrasslands and vernal pools in California and Oregon.It is a current subject of much research. It can becultivated as an annual crop and perhaps grown in ricefields. The plan is to use the oil as a substitute forsperm whale oil. The U. S. once imported about 50million pounds per year.Castor oil (Ricinus communis). The ornamentalcastor bean plant is also the source of an importantindustrial oil. The United States is the largestimporter. The oil content of the seed varies from 35-55%. Castor oil is found in soap, synthetic rubber,linoleum, inks, nylons, and as a lubricant in airplaneand rocket engines. About 1% of the production goesinto a more refined version that is used in medicine,where it is called \"oleum ricini.\" It is a very effectivepurgative, an agent that causes evacuation of thebowels.Olive oil (Olea europea). The olive tree, native towestern Asia, is another of our most ancient plants. Itis probably the most important of the non-drying oils.The oil is not extracted from the seed itself, but fromthe fruit pulp that surrounds it. Two to four pressingsare often involved, the first of which yields thegreenish-yellow \"virgin\" oil. If the fruits were from thehighest quality trees, processed in a particular way(mechanical vs. chemical extraction), meet certainaesthetic standards, and have less than 1% free oleicacid, then the product can be called \"extra virgin\"olive oil. Use of the term is regulated by theInternational Olive Oil Council (IOOC). The U. S. is nota member, but California producers have formed theCOOC. Olive oil has a prominent role as a salad andcooking oil. It has a long shelf life. Hippies andYuppies have been known to get all misty-eyed whendiscussing the virtues of olive oil. Later pressings findtheir way into soap, lubricants, and medicines.Linseed oil (Linum usitatissimum). We grow somecultivars of flax for their fibers and others for the oilcontent in their seeds (32-43%). Linseed oil is used inpaint, oilcloth, soft soaps, varnish, ink, linoleum, andto seal various surfaces, including concrete highways.Safflower oil (Carthamus tinctorius). This memberof the sunflower family is known only in cultivation.The ancient Egyptians appear to be the first to haveused it. The oil content of the seeds is about 40%. Ithas the highest percentage of linoleic acid. Saffloweroil has become a very popular cooking oil because itis low in cholesterol. It is also used in shortening,margarine, salad oils, and mayonnaise.Peanut oil (Arachis hypogaea). The peanut isnative to South America, perhaps to Brazil. It hasbecome a major crop in the United States, especiallyin the South. The seeds have oil content of 30-45%.The higher grades of peanut oil are used in margarineand shortening, and to pack sardines. The inferiorgrades end up in soap, lubricants, and illuminants.Corn oil (Zea mays). The oil content is about 50%.Corn oil is used in cooking and salads (Mazola oil), andto make margarine. It smokes when heated to hightemperatures. Industrial uses include soap, paints,and in rubber substitutes.Cottonseed oil (Gossypium spp.). Cotton seedscontain about 35% oil. Refined oils are used incooking and salad oils, margarine, and shortening.Processing inactivates gossypol, a toxin found inglands within the seed. Inferior grades end up insoaps. Cottonseed oil is the most important of thesemi-drying oils.FIXED (NON-AROMATIC) OIL PLANTSFixed Oil Scientific Name FamilyMAJOR OIL CROPS:African palm oil Elaeis guineensis palmAmerican palm oil Elaeis oleifera palmcastor oil Ricinus communis spurgecoconut oil Cocos nucifera palmcorn oil Zea mays grasscotton seed oil Gossypium spp. mallowlinseed oil Linum usitatissimum flaxolive oil Olea europaea olivepeanut oil Arachis hypogaea beanrapeseed (rape) oil Brassica spp. mustardsesame oil Sesamum indicum pedaliumsoybean oil Glycine max beansunflower oil Helianthus annuus sunflowerMINOR OIL CROPS:babassu oil Orbignya phalerata palmben oil Moringa pterygosperma moringaBrazil nut oil Bertholletia excelsa Brazil nutbuffalo gourd oil Cucurbita foetidissima squashcajeput oil Melaleuca leucadendron myrtlecandlenut oil Aleurites moluccana spurgecanola oil Brassica napus, B. campestris mustardcarapa oil Carapa guianensis mahoganycashew nut oil Anacardium occidentale cashewchaulmoogra oil Hydnocarpus kurzii flacourtia-148-China wood oil Aleurites fordii spurgecocoa butter oil Theobroma cacao sterculiacohune oil Orbignya cohune palmcolza oil Brassica napus mustardcroton oil Croton tiglium spurgeeng oil Dipterocarpus tuberculatus dipterocarpgorli oil Oncoba echinata flacourtiagurgum (gurjun) oil Dipterocarpus spp. dipterocarphempseed oil Cannabis sativa hempillipe nut oil Shorea macrophylla dipterocarpjojoba oil Simmondsia chinensis simmondsiakapok seed oil Ceiba pentandra bombaxlicuri oil Syagrus coronata palmmacassar oil Schleichera oleosa soapberrymeadowfoam Limnanthes spp. meadowfoammurumuru oil Astrocaryum murumuru palmmustard oil Sinapis spp. and Brassica spp. mustardNiger seed oil Guizotia abyssinica sunfloweroiticica oil Licania rigida coco plumpeach oil Prunus persica roseperilla oil Perilla frutescens mintpistachio oil Pistacia vera cashewpoppy seed oil Papaver somniferum poppysafflower oil Carthamus tinctorius sunflowertung oil Aleurites fordii spurgewalnut oil Juglans regia walnut -149-8.9 ! TANNINS AND DYESTannins and dyes are secretion products found almostuniversally in plants. They are usually notconcentrated enough to make extractions worthwhile.Tannins and dyes are combinations of carbon,hydrogen, and oxygen. Nitrogen is present in somecases. Dyes, in particular, have been largely replacedby synthetic derivatives of coal tars. Only about 10%of our currently used dyes are of natural origins.TANNINSThis term is applied to a wide variety of astringentsubstances. Generally speaking, they are metabolicbreakdown products of sugars. Tannins are watersoluble and are chemical reducing agents. Thefunction of tannins within the plant body is obscure.Perhaps they play a protective role. They are usuallyfound in out of the way places, such as heartwood orthe cork, rather than sites of active growth ormovement of materials.The principal use of tannins is in the tanning industry.They combine with proteins in animal skin to yieldleather, which is resistant to water, air, temperaturechanges, and bacterial attack. During the tanningprocess, the animal skin is soaked in a tanninextraction for a period of time ranging from just a fewhours to several months. The leather can then befurther treated with oils to restore some pliability anddyed.Tannins also combine with iron salts to form the basisof several inks. Tannins have some medical uses, suchas antidotes to alkaloid and heavy metal poisoning,and in reducing gastric bleeding and diarrhea.SURVEY OF TANNIN PLANTSChestnut (Castanea dentata). Tannins are extractedfrom the wood. This source has practicallydisappeared in the U.S. because of excessive loggingand the chestnut blight.Tanner's dock or canaigre (Rumex hymeno-sepalus). An annual species of the south-western U.S.The roots contain 25-35% tannins.Sumac (Rhus coriaria). The species is native to Sicily.The leaves contain about 35% tannins. Our nativespecies of Rhus also have tannins in them, but theyare inferior in their tanning ability.Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). This coniferous treelargely replaced the chestnut, but now it is alsodisappearing. The bark contains 8-14% tannins. T.heterophylla of the western U.S. has become moreimportant as a tannin source since the decline of theeastern hemlock.Quebracho (Schinopsis lorentzii). This plant is theforemost source of natural tannins. The tree is nativeto Argentina and Paraguay. The wood contains about22% tannins. The U.S. imports great quantities ofquebracho tannins each year.Mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). The bark contains55-58% tannins after concentration. This is one of thecheapest tannin sources. The U.S. is the chiefimporter.Wattle (Acacia spp.). These trees are usually nativeto Australia. They are now widely planted. The barkcontains about 50% tannins.Gambier (Uncaria gambir). This species is native tothe East Indies. A resin in the leaves contains 35-40%tannins.DYESWhether natural or synthetic, dyes are chemicallyrelatively straightforward. Fustic, for example, has theempirical formula C13H10O6. As with tannins, thefunction that the dye performs in plants is not wellunderstood.Dyes have been in use for thousands of years. No oneknows how many different dyes there are, but aconservative estimate is at least 2000.When dyes were first used to color and decorate cloth,they were impermanent and faded rather quickly. Thecolors would also change with time. It was necessaryto fix and bind the dye with the fibers of the cloth.This was done by using a mordant. Most of themordants are salts of metals. By using a differentmordant with a specific dye, the color value of the dyemay be changed.SURVEY OF DYE PLANTSWoad (Isatis tinctoria). This plant is perhaps native tosouthern Russia. Its use spread rapidly, however. Theleaves contain a glucoside, indican. The leaves arecrushed by rollers to extract a pulpy material. This isrolled into a ball and dried. The balls are laterpulverized, wetted, and fermented. The woad is thendried once more and may be stored in this form.When it is to be used, fermentation is once morerequired. Two uses of woad are of some historicalinterest. When the Romans invaded Briton, they foundthe inhabitants using woad to decorate their bodies.Later in English history, woad and a yellow dye weremixed to yield the \"Saxon Green\" dye worn by RobinHood and his Merry Men.Indigo (Indigofera tinctoria). This is one of the bestknown dyes. It is a brilliant blue. Oxidation is requiredbefore the color develops."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Glycine max', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None},

Scarcely had I accomplished thisfeat when a large cigar, 2 feet long and a thick as thewrist, was put lighted into my hand, and etiquettedemanded that I should take a few whiffs of it -- Iwho had never in my life smoked a cigar or a pipe oftobacco. Above all this, I must drink a large cup ofpalm-wine, and it will readily be understood that theeffect of such a complex dose was a strong inclinationto vomit, which was only overcome by lying down ina hammock and drinking a cup of coffee which thefriend who accompanied me had taken the precautionto prepare beforehand. \"\"In two minutes or less after drinking it, its effectsbegin to be apparent.

A period of abnormal lassitudethen set in during which colours increased in intensity.Sooner or later a deep sleep interrupted by dream-likesequences began. The only uncomfortable after-effectnoted was intestinal upset and diarrhoea on thefollowing day. At no time was movement of limbsadversely affected. In fact, amongst many AmazonianIndians, dancing forms part of the caapi-ritual.\" [Richard Evans Schultes]' ' ' ' 'Ayahuasca, also called caapi and yaje, is apsychoactive drink made by the Indians of thewestern Amazon region. One of the earliest writtenaccounts of the use of ayahuasca is that ofVillavicencio. He reported that the drink helped theIndians to decipher enemy war plans, to formulatereplies to ambassadors in matters of war and peace,to interpret illness, and to help young men endure thephysical pain associated with certain initiations intomanhood.Ayahuasca is the bark of Banisteriopsis caapi and B.inebrians, sometimes fortified with the bark of B.rusbyana. These plants belong to Malpighiaceae, afamily little known to us in North America. As with somany of the South American preparations, variousadditives are often included. These confuse theethnobotanist and chemist and delay a trueunderstanding of the formulae used.The effects of caapi are an early feeling ofnervousness and giddiness, sometimes nausea andvomiting, profuse perspiration, and flashes of lightbefore the eyes. There follows a deep sleep withhallucinations. Early chemical work by Fischer-Cardenas isolated an alkaloid called telepathine. Morerecent work shows the active principle to be anotheralkaloid, harmine, and perhaps harmaline.OLOLIUQUIThe early Spanish historians reported the use ofhallucinogenic seeds by Aztec priests who used themas an analgesic. They were commonly employedbefore making sacrifices on mountain tops and whencommunication with the gods was required. Todaythese morning glory seeds may be the most widelyused hallucinogen of the Mexican Indians. Untilrecently, their use was relatively unknown outsideethnobotanical circles.The identity of ololiuqui remained in doubt for about400 years. Crude drawings and descriptions gave thestrong impression that the plant was a member of themorning glory family. Other experts suggested that itmight be the \"sacred datura,\" Datura inoxia. InMexico, botanists and anthropologists working on theproblem believed that the plant was Rivea corymbosa(now called Turbina corymbosa). In 1939, RichardSchultes found it growing next to the doorway of aZapotec witch-doctor in Oaxaca. This was notaccepted as sufficient proof of the identity of ololiuqui-217-until Albert Hofmann (the discoverer of LSD-25)isolated lysergic acid derivatives from the seeds.Since that time, McDougall discovered the use ofIpomoea violacea in conjunction with or as asubstitute for Rivea. This has helped to clear up someof the botanical confusion.-218-SECTION 12 ! ETHNOBOTANICAL STUDIES12.1 ! AN OVERVIEW' Many of the early ethnobotanical studies weresimple in concept. Which plants did a particularpeople use and how did they use them?' The techniques and methodology used in modernstudies are much more sophisticated, showingvery clearly their dependence on other disciplinesin the natural and social sciences.' Controversy continues as to the focus ofethnobotanical research. Is it just the study of\"primitive\" peoples?' To what extent do intellectual property rightsextend to the fruits of ethnobotanical research?' What is a fair compensation to a people whoseknowledge translates into a multi-million dollarproduct, such as a new medicine?' More than ever, there is a sense of urgency.Everyone has heard of endangered species. Whatabout \"endangered knowledge?\"12.2 ! GOALS &TECHNIQUES\"The best ethnobotanist would be a member of anethnic minority who, trained in both botany andanthropology, would study ... the traditionalknowledge, cultural significance, and the managementand uses of the flora. And it would be even better --for him and his people -- if his study could result ineconomic and cultural benefits for his owncommunity.\" (A. Barrera)\"Our challenge is to salvage some of the native ... lorebefore it becomes forever entombed with the culturesthat gave it birth.\" (Richard Evans Schultes)' ' ' ' 'We have looked at the scope of economic botany orethnobotany, its history, the domestication of plants,exploration for useful ones, and the plantsthemselves, grouped by how they are used. Thepurpose of this section is to introduce you to howethnobotanical studies are carried out and in the\"Selected References\" section to show a reasonablycomprehensive list of the published results of thisresearch.RELATED DISCIPLINESTo a considerable degree, ethnobotany is not a standalone discipline. In other words, much of theinformation that it uses, and the analyticalapproaches that it employs are those of otherscientific disciplines. They include traditional botany(especially taxonomy), pharmacology, anthropology,archeology, ecology, economics, and linguistics.GOALS OF RESEARCHThe early studies were rather straightforward: how dothe people of tribe X use plant Y for purpose Z. Thosecarrying out the studies tended to be from Europe orNorth America; those studied were often located inremote, poorly known parts of the world. They werecharacterized as primitive, unlettered, non-industrialized, and non-urbanized.The earlier procedure of simply preparing a list or acatalogue of useful plants no longer satisfiesethnobotanical enquiry. Current research ischaracterized by the diversity of its research stylesand its objectives. \"Contemporary ethnobotany examines the dynamicinterdependencies between humans and plants,recognizing that plants permeate materially,symbolically, and metaphorically every aspect ofculture and that nature is by no means passive tohuman actions. The subject matter of ethnobotanyencompasses traditional primitives and prehistoricpeople as well as literate societies, acknowledging thatwe have much to learn about our society's folk botanyquite apart from the economic botany of modernindustry and agrobusiness.... Thus, ethnobotany ismore than simply an examination of plants useful tonon-Western people, for it is devoted tounderstanding the limitations and behavioralconsequences of human actions on their botanicalenvironment.\" (Ford, 1981)QUESTIONS THAT NEED ASKINGAlcorn (1995) suggested the following:' Which plants are available?' Why are they available?' What factors cause a plant to be viewed as aresource?' How is knowledge distributed in the population?' What do the people think about plants?' How do they differentiate and classify elements intheir environment?' From which resource zone(s) are plantsharvested?' How are they used?' What economic/financial benefits are derived?-219-' How are the plant populations managed?' What is the effect of this management on the localvegetation and on local institutions?' How have human activities influenced theevolution of local plants?KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMSIn carrying out ethnobotanical research, it is importantto realize that although all cultures have studied thenatural world around them, they have done so usingdifferent values and approaches. The followingcomparison of knowledge systems is based on thework of Johnson (1992). While useful in drawing apoint by point contrast between two world views, Isuspect that our scientific methods of conductingethnobotanical research have been modified in recentyears as the result of a better understanding of howtraditional knowledge of plants and their uses isgenerated.TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS' All parts of natural world regarded as animate; alllife forms as interdependent' Knowledge transmitted largely through oral media' Knowledge developed and acquired throughobservation and practical experience' Knowledge is holistic, intuitive, qualitative, andpractical' Knowledge generated by resource users on a long-term time scale' Nature and status of particular knowledgeinfluenced by sociocultural factors, such asspiritual beliefs, and communally held' Explanations behind perceived phenomena oftenspiritually-based and subjective' Knowledge used to make suitable decisions undervariable conditionsWESTERN SCIENTIFIC SYSTEMS' Human life generally regarded as superior, withmoral right to control other life forms' Knowledge transmitted largely through writtenword' Knowledge generally learned in situation remotefrom its applied context' Knowledge essentially reductionist, quantitative,analytical, and theoretical' Knowledge generated largely by specialists on ashort term time scale' Nature and status of particular knowledgeinfluenced by peer review, and held by individuals' Explanations behind perceived phenomenaessentially rational and objective' Knowledge used to put forward hypotheses and toverify underlying laws or constants.-220-SECTION 13 ! PLANTS BY GROUP/FAMILYThis list began as a updating and expansion of oneprepared by Albert F. Hill (1952) for his introductorytextbook in economic botany... and, I'm afraid it justgot out of hand! I also thought it would be useful toadd a brief description of how the plant is used andwhat part yields the product. There are a number ofmore or less encyclopedic references on this subject.The number of plants and the details of their uses aresimply overwhelming. In the list below, I haveattempted to focus on plants that are of directeconomic importance to us, and to present them bygroups or families. I have not included ornamentals,weeds, and toxic plants (unless we knowingly usethem to kill something or someone). The variousdictionaries of economic plants also include, on a hit-and-miss basis, plants that are sometimes eaten onlylocally or that have been used medicinally in somefashion. I have included only those food plants thatenjoy wider use and those medicinal plants that havedemonstrated properties. There is an emphasis onplants of the New World.The listing of nonvascular plants, ferns, and their alliesis short enough to scan quickly to find a particularplant. The much more extensive coverage of floweringplants is arranged by plant family.If you are not familiar with their technical names, lookat the end of this section for assistance.

How can we manage dairy animal health and welfare?M. CaropreseDepartment of Agriculture, Food, Natural Resources, and Engineering (DAFNE), University of Foggia, ItalyConsumers constantly require healthy food from healthy animals and are aware that milk quality has important impacts on human health. In the last few years, there is a growing concern about livestock health and welfare in relation to the spread of antimicrobial resistance caused by the misuse of antibiotics, highlighting the interest of new alternatives to antibiotics in veterinary medicine practices. As an alternative to the use of antibiotics, there is a considerable interest in the use of feed supplementation, such as oily seeds, and additives, such as compounds or mixtures, added in animal feed to improve health status, growth rate, productivity, and performance of dairy animals. Feed supplementations and additives can be used as growth promoters, antimicrobials, immunostimulators, and antioxidants, having a particular role for the livestock health, and thus satisfying the increasing consumer demand for natural foods with functional properties. On the other hands, meeting the increasing demand for animal-based food for the increasing human population is a major sustainability challenge. A possible approach could be an increase in total efficiency and the reduction of the impact of livestock by feeding livestock recycling biomass from agro-food systems unsuitable as food. The use of by-products from the agro-food system could reduce feed-food competition and, therefore, the utilization of croplands for feed production. Moreover, the use of agricultural by-products in animal feeding represents a circular economy model to guarantee the production of healthy and affordable food by reducing the livestock system impact from an environmental and societal point of view and minimizing waste outputs. The effects on the use of feed supplementation or additives, also deriving from of agro-industrial by-products, will be presented and analysed in terms of milk quality and dairy animal health and welfare.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org4620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL10. Evaluation of sesquiterpenes as permeation enhancers for transdermal delivery.D. FatourosSchool of Pharmacy, Aristotle university of Thessaloniki, GreeceChemical permeation enhancers (sulfoxides, pyrrolidones, fatty acids, alcohols and glycols, surfactants, urea and its derivatives, essential oils, terpenes and their derivatives, phospholipids) have been used extensively to promote the transport of actives across human skin. Among them active compounds derived from essential oils (terpenes) have been widely used as permeation enhancers for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Terpenes can interact with intracellular lipids in the SC to increase the diffusion of the drugs. Beyond the relatively small monoterpenes, larger terpene molecules (sesquiterpenes) have also been evaluated as enhancers for molecules permeating human skin membranes. Recent work from our team demonstrated the effect of sesquiterpenes as chemical enhancers for the transdermal delivery of a model macromolecular compound across human skin in vitro.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 4720th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL11. Archaeoethnopharmacological studies in South America: back to the roots of ethnopharmacology?J. EcheverriaDepartamento de Ciencias el Ambiente Facultad de Quimica y Biologia, Universidad de Santiago de ChileSince the term Ethnopharmacology was defined in 1967, this scientific discipline was closely linked to the study of psychoactive plants. This is demonstrated by the pioneering studies of hallucinogenic snuffs from South America (Bo Holmstedt), alkaloids from cacti collected in the Mexican desert (Jan G Bruhn), and tryptamines/beta-carbolines from ayahuasca samples collected in the Amazon (Laurent Rivier). With time, this discipline has evolved to other themes, topics, and interests, losing - to a great extent - its original essence.Recent archaeological investigations in archaeological materials found in various archaeological sites in South America have focused their interest on the chemical and botanical study of the material evidence of the consumption of psychoactive plants by the first inhabitants of the continent, to understand and interpret the cultural complexity of these practices in prehistory.At present, is fascinating and captivating to recognize that very distant and different disciplines such as archaeology and ethnopharmacology, have merged into common scientific interests. The most important convergence points are the context of the study material, psychoactive plants; the analytical, botanical/chemical/pharmacological approach; as well as the geographic context, South America. It is neither illogical nor unrealistic to propose the emergence of a new discipline, Archaeoethnopharmacology. This conference will reveal the close relationship between the origins of ethnopharmacology and recent chemical and botanical studies of archaeological materials associated with the use of psychoactive substances in the prehistory of South America. The main plant species and their most important management practices will be reviewed. These antecedents will seek to answer the following question: Are we facing a return to the roots of ethnopharmacology?www.ethnopharmacology2021.org4820th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL12.

How can the results of ethnopharmacological field studies be reported so that researchers with different backgrounds can draw on the results and develop new research questions and projects? And how should these field data be presented to get accepted in a scientific journal such as JEP?We focus on conducting and reporting ethnopharmacological field studies on medicinal plants or materia medica and associated knowledge of a specific people or region.We highlight the most frequent problems encountered in literature, own fieldwork and insights gained from peer-reviewing of field studies [1].Research needs to be ethical and legal and follow local and national regulations. Primary ethnopharmacological field data need to be collected and presented in a transparent and comprehensible way. In short this includes: 1) Relevant and concise research questions, 2) Thorough literature study encompassing all available information on the study site from different disciplines, 3) Appropriate methods to answer the research questions, 4) Proper plant use documentation, unambiguously linked to voucher specimens, and 5) Qualitative and quantitative analyses of the collected data, the latter relying on use-reports as basic units.

Pharmacopeias for Indian herbal drugsP. K. Mukherjee1,2, A. Kar1, S. Banerjee21Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development, Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, Imphal, Manipur2School of Natural Product Studies, Dept of Pharmaceutical Technology, Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India Among Indian systems of medicines, herbs/herbal formulations occupy a prominent place. The quality control of these herbal formulations is important for maintaining their safety, efficacy and export potential to other countries. Indian systems of medicine use pharmacopoeias for the quality control and standardization herbs and formulations. Various pharmacopoeias are published in India stating the quality control specification. Major among them is Indian Pharmacopoeia (IP) which contains 168 specific monographs of herbs. Herbal Products and Phytopharmaceuticals Monograph Development Subcommittee of IPC, is developing the Phytopharmaceutical Ingredient (PPI) category monograph with the support of stakeholders. AYUSH is working on promotion of Indian traditional medicine (ITM) and developing pharmacoepial specifications for drugs used in Indian medicine (IM). Ministry of AYUSH, Govt of India and Pharmacopoeia commission for Indian medicine & homoeopathy Ghaziabad publishes Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API). API cover monographs of 645 plant derived drugs. Monographs for 191 herbal formulations are published in Ayurvedic formulary of India. Other than API, Siddha Pharmacopoeia of India part I consists of monographs of 139 plant derived drugs. It consists of a brief introduction, synonym, description (macroscopic, microscopic, powder), foreign matter, total ash, acid insoluble ash, alcohol soluble extractive, water soluble extractive, liquid chromatography assay with reference standard, thin layer chromatography for fingerprinting, chemical constituents, properties and actions, important formulations, therapeutic uses and dose. Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of India consists of monographs of 1117 plant derived drugs. Unani Pharmacopoeia of India cover 298 herbal drugs and 150 herbal formulations. Quality standards of Indian Medicinal plants by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) are a non pharmacopoeial reference guide on standards of Indian herbs. Monographs on 449 plants are included in this guide. Indian Herbal Pharmacopoeia published by Indian Drugs Manufacturers Association (IDMA) containing 40 monographs of medicinal plants. The inclusions of herbs/herbal formulations in Pharmacopoeia have helped develop quality standards of these herbal medicines. This would ensure use of quality herbs/herbal products and improve its export potential through maintaining internationally accepted standards for quality thus promoting Indian herbal drug industry.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org5020th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL14. Traditional Herbal Resources and Herbal Pharmacopoeia: the contribution of the Taiwanese flora.C.-H. LinSchool of Chinese Medicine, College of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University.Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, China Medical University HospitalTaichung, TaiwanIn Taiwan, more than 30% of Taiwanese utilize Chinese medicine. However, 80% of the raw herbal materials come from abroad. Geographically, Taiwan has diverse terrains and mountains surrounded by the sea, and different climates across tropical, temperate and frigid zones. Therefore, it creates an enriched ecological environment for medicinal plants in Taiwan. Breeding more than 4000 kinds of vascular plants.There are many indigenous peoples in Taiwan who rely on fishing, hunting, gathering and planting for their livelihoods. Therefore, natural medicinal resources have been used for many years to reduce or treat diseases, which is a valuable source for the development of pharmacy. Thanks to the assistance of the Japanese in hundreds of years ago, they began to systematically sort out the medicinal herbs in Taiwan, with more than 300 species in total. Because Taiwan is a humid and sultry environment, most of medicinal plants are the effects of clearing away heat, detoxifying, and promoting blood circulation. In Taiwan, in addition to the private use of medicinal plants, the government is also actively including native medicinal plants in the pharmacopoeia.The first edition of the Taiwan Herbal Pharmacopoeia was published in 2004, which was revised and a third edition was published in 2018. The Taiwan Herbal Pharmacopoeia regulates the quality of Chinese medicinal materials, containing 357 items, including 329 plants, 13 animals, 6 fungi, 3 insects and 4 minerals. In addition, Taiwan's native species Dendrobium tosaense, Bletilla formosana, Orthosiphon aristatus, Pteris multifda, Litsea cubeba and Uncaria lanosa var. appendiculata are added.The government also actively supports the development of local herb in the research of active ingredients and pharmacology. For example, the Agriculture and Food Agency and Taiwan Seed Improvement and Propagation Station have also invested in Chinese herbal medicine for many years. Some school research center uses traditional pharmacy knowledge to integrate database and literature as the basis for scientific and systematic sound quality control and application, to promote the internationalization of Taiwan's traditional Chinese medicine and the development of the traditional Chinese medicine industry.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 5120th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL15. Evaluating Greek honey-bees' products (Honey, Propolis, Royal Jelly) through centuries, as vehicle of high value chemical and pharmacological potential.I. ChinouLaboratory of Pharmacognosy and Chemistry of Natural Products, Dept. of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, GreeceHoney-bees (Apis mellifera) have played an important role through centuries. Famous Greek honey has observed an increasing interest in its use in traditional Mediterranean food. Propolis, a resinous material by bees, derived from the Greek \"pro\", in front of, at the entrance to, and \"polis\" the city/community; a substance that is in defense of the city/hive. It has been used in folk medicine, cosmetology and in food industry for health foods, and nutrition supplements. The chemistry of propolis is highly depended on the flora of the geographic region from which it is collected. The rich flora of Greece contributes a lot to a distinguished chemical profile of proposed as \"Mediterranean type of propolis\", well accepted after our investigations. Royal jelly is secreted by the hypopharyngeal gland of young worker (nurse) bees, to feed young larvae and the adult queen bee. It has been harvested in very small quantities and also is so expensive. Some Hundreds of samples of Greek/Mediterranean bee keeping products till now, have been chemically analysed and several isolated compounds have been structurally determined by modern spectral means. Furthermore, they were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Gram (+) bacteria and fungi. Their anti-oxidative activity has been also assayed together with cytotoxicities. RJ samples, were further subjected i) in a clinical study at postmenopausal healthy women, showing a significant decrease in LDL and increase in HDL- cholesterol ii) in an in vivo study on Wistar male rats in Water-maze test, where RJ exerted an improvement of the spatial memory while iii) strong immunomodulatory influence. All these bioactivities, therefore, have considerable commercial appeal, ranging from the pharmaceutical and food industries up to cosmetic ones.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org5220th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES IL16.

Multidirectional pharma-toxicological investigations on Harpagophytum procumbens DC. ex Meisn. : focus on water extract activity.G. OrlandoDepartment of Pharmacy, University <<G. d'Annunzio>> of Chieti-Pescara, ItalyInflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic, relapsing and multifactorial disorders of the colonic mucosa, which show increased and unbalanced intestinal immune response to external stimuli. Plant-derived extracts were described to possess the capability in contrasting IBDs related oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways. In the present study, we investigated the water extract of Harpagophytum procumbens DC. ex Meisn. in an experimental model of IBDs. Additionally, a microbiological investigation was carried out to discriminate the efficacy against bacterial and fungal strains involved in IBD. Finally, an untargeted proteomic analysis was conducted on more than 100 colon proteins involved in tissue morphology and metabolism. The extract blunted the level of selected biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, including serotonin, prostaglandins, cytokines and transcription factors. Additionally, the extract inhibited the growth of Candida albicans and C. tropicalis. The extract was also able to exert a pro-homeostatic effect on the levels of multiple colon proteins, thus corroborating protective effects against the burden of inflammation and oxidative stress. On the other hand, the supraphysiological downregulation of cytoskeletal-related proteins involved in tissue morphology and antimicrobial barrier function, namely ezrin, actin, plastin-1, smoothelin and defensins, was observed, as well.

All parts of the plant seem to contain the latex,but the leaves lack the alkaloids that are the activeprinciple. The seeds are essentially devoid of alkaloidsas well, so poppy seed rolls may be eaten without fearof addiction.A few days after the delicate petals have fallen fromthe poppy flowers, workers enter the fields and makeincisions in the fruits. These cuts are not deep and donot pierce the seed chamber. The incisions bleed alatex that hardens in about a day. The latex is thenscraped from the fruits, removing some of theepidermis as well. This crude dried exudate is opium.Externally opium is a pale olive-brown or gray, with acoarse surface. It is often covered with poppy leavesor the plant parts from other packing material. Insideit is reddish-brown and granular. It has a very bittertaste. The use of crude opium has declined greatly inrecent years, although the tincture and camphoratedtincture of opium are still popular.THE ACTIVE PRINCIPLESOpium contains about 25 alkaloids. Morphine andcodeine are probably the best known. Their relativepercentages vary. Opium may be 5-15% morphineand 0.1-2% codeine. The function of these alkaloids inthe plant is uncertain. It has been suggested that thebitter latex may protect the plants against insects orthat the alkaloids provide a nitrogen reserve formaking proteins.Morphine is the chief narcotic principle in opium. Thereare various ways of separating it and purifying it. Inone of these, macerated opium is mixed with waterand the morphine precipitated by ammonia. Thecrystals are then purified. A similar process involvesammonia and sulfuric acid. Morphine was first isolatedin 1803. The effects of the alkaloid are a state ofpleasant drowsiness and muscular relaxation. There isa freedom from anxiety, a shortening of the sense oftime, an increased ability to discriminate, a decreasedability to concentrate, a lessening of physical activity,dimness of vision, and lethargy. Finally the subjectdrifts into a restful sleep. The advantages to medicineof such an alkaloid are immediately apparent.Morphine became one of the chief pain killers,permitting surgery under greatly improved conditions.Unfortunately, morphine exhibits both physiologicaland psychological dependence. The subject becomestolerant of it so that increased dosages are required toachieve desired results, and the withdrawal frommorphine is especially painful.Codeine is generally like morphine, but much milder.The effects of codeine are approximately 1/6 to 1/10those of morphine. Codeine is a common ingredient incough preparations. It is a narcotic and produces bothphysical and psychological dependence. Withdrawalsymptoms are present, but they are much milder thanthose associated with morphine. Tolerance to codeinealso develops.THE SYNTHETIC DERIVATIVESHeroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine. Itis not, therefore, a naturally occurring alkaloid. Heroinis made by adding acetic anhydride or acetylchlorideto morphine. The result is a white, odorless,crystalline powder that is very bitter. It is soluble inwater. Heroin was developed in Germany in 1898 asan analgesic more powerful than morphine. Ananalgesic is a painkiller that does not render thepatient unconscious, unless it is administered in largedoses. Heroin is three or four times stronger thanmorphine. Strangely enough, it was widely used tohelp morphine addicts through their difficultwithdrawal periods and was hailed as a cure formorphine addiction. Several years passed before itbecame apparent that heroin was itself addictive.Today heroin plays no significant role in medicine. Itis under strict government supervision. Heroin addictseither inject the material, as with morphine, or theymay inhale it. Heroin is the only opiate that has aneffect on the mucous membranes of the nose.Methadone is to heroin what heroin was oncethought to be to morphine. Methadone is a syntheticdrug used to break addiction to heroin. It is slightlymore potent than morphine and it is nearly aseffective taken orally as it is by injection. Methadoneis both physically and psychologically addictive.Former heroin addicts who are using methadone mustcontinue to use methadone in its place.THE EFFECTS OF THE OPIATESThe naturally occurring and synthetic derivatives havethe following effects in humans:' pleasant drowsiness' muscular relaxation' freedom from anxiety' shortens sense of passage of time' increased ability to discriminate' decreased ability to concentrate' lessened physical activity' contracted pupils' dimness of vision' lethargy' slowed respiration' sleep' delays in emptying of stomach' slows peristalsis in small and large intestines' stimulates, then depresses the central nervoussystem' pain-killing, hypnotic, and narcotic effectsADDICTION & WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMSA number of studies have focused on the long termeffects of addiction to opiates.

Marijuana does very well indisturbed, nitrogen-rich wastelands near humans. Theplant has been used for about 12,000 years as thesource of fibers, oils, food, medicine, and it remainsone of the most widely used psychoactive plants.Historical references to the use of marijuana aboundin the literature. One of the more interesting tales,perhaps an apocryphal one, concerns Hassan-Ibn-Al-Sabbah, the 12th century leader of a band ofmountain raiders who swooped down on unsuspectingcaravans and Crusaders. According to legend, Hassanused to instill courage and the ability to endure painby having his men take one of the strongerpreparations from the hemp plant. The group becameknown as Hashishins, from which our modern wordassassin is derived.CLASSIFICATIONHemp was named by Linnaeus. He recognized onlyone species, Cannabis sativa, a view that is still widelyheld. Other competent experts in the field of plantsystematics argue that there are at least three speciesof: C. sativa, a taller plant of the northern latitudes;C. indica, a low-growing plant of more southerndistribution; and C. ruderalis, a small, unbranchedplant native to Russia and Europe. At various times,Cannabis has been placed in the mulberry family(Moraceae), the nettle family (Urticaceae), and in itsown family (Cannabaceae). The last opinion hasprevailed and now most botanists put marijuana inCannabaceae, along with hops (Humulus lupulus).The plants are large perennials, with male and femaleflowers occurring on separate plants. The active-204-principle is concentrated in the bracts associated withthe female flowers, although the leaves and stemsalso contain the resinous material.PREPARATIONSThe marijuana cigarette is the only form known tomost users in this country. The leaves, flowering tops,and sometimes the stems are often mixed withtobacco and then smoked. In the Old World, however,where Cannabis has been in use for thousands ofyears, several different preparations and modes of useare employed.Hasheesh or hashish, derived from the resin ofrecently fertilized female flowers, is popular amongthe Muslim peoples of northern Africa and westernAsia where it is smoked (often through a water pipe),eaten, or drunk.In India, Cannabis is used in a variety of ways. Threepreparations are commonly encountered.Bhang, is prepared from uncultivated plants. Thedried parts are powdered and then mixed with wateror milk. It is smoked or drunk. It is the weakestpreparation.Ganja or ganjah is prepared by gathering theflowering tops of very carefully selected female plants.It is usually smoked with tobacco, but it may be eatenor drunk like bhang. It is considered superior to bhangin its psychoactive effects.Charas is prepared from pure resinous materialcollected from especially cultivated female plants. It isnormally smoked, but it may be eaten. It isconsidered the most potent preparation, in that itcontains the highest percentage of active resins.ACTIVE PRINCIPLESThe resin contains a series of active and inactive non-nitrogenous compounds derived from terpenes. Theyinclude cannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabigerol,cannabichromene, cannabidiolic acid, tetra-h y d r o c a n n a b i n o l - c a r b o x y l i c a c i d ,tetrahydrocannabinol, and its various stereo-isomers.The latter group is collectively calledtetrahydrocanninols or THC. Delta-9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol appears to be the activeprinciple responsible for producing euphoria. It is alsoavailable medically to control the nausea associatedwith cancer chemotherapy. Some forms have beensynthesized recently and are now available for clinicalstudy. Common cultivars average about 1.0-1.5%THC; some of the very potent sinsemilla (Spanish forseedless) and various hybrids now reach 12-13%. \"BCBuds\" from Vancouver, British Columbia contain 25-30% THC!PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS' Dizziness, vertigo, and light-headedness' Increased heart beat' Slight rise in blood pressure (sometimes)' Dryness of mouth and throat' Impaired coordination (ataxis)' Hunger and/or craving for sweets' Nausea and vomiting (sometimes)' Burning of the eyes' Ringing or pressure in the ears' Urge to urinate and defecate (sometimes)PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS' Vague dread/anxiety (among inexperienced)' Disorientation of thinking' Disturbance to memory' Euphoria, giggling, hilarity' Desire to speak more freely' Depersonalization' Spatial/temporal distortions' Floating sensation' Detachment' Drowsiness' Stimulation or depression or both' Heightened perception of colors, music, etc.The effects of a single, inhaled marijuana cigaretteappear to reach their maximum intensity within about30 minutes, to be diminished after about 1 hour, andto be dissipated after about 3 hours according to Weil,Zinberg, and Nelson (1968).EFFECTS FROM CHRONIC USEThere have been numerous studies looking at the longterm effects of Cannabis on the human body."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Papaver somniferum', 'medical_conditions': ['anxiety', 'pain'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Cannabis sativa', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Cannabis indica', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'C. sativa', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'C. indica', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'C. ruderalis', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Cannabis', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Humulus lupulus', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

Plants such as kawakawa (Piper excelsum), manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), and koromiko (Hebe salicifolia), for example, were among 31 those listed, the last being noted as a treatment for diarrhoea. There was no recognition in these pages of the wider spiritual context of rongoa Maori as a whole system of healing, which is much more complex than herbal medicines alone (Ahuriri-Driscoll, 2014). . The persistence of home remedies into the mid-20th century The home remedies and self-help therapies mentioned in the Colonists' Guide may sound quaint and outdated today, but many of them were still current until at least the early 1970s. My own memories stretch back to my early childhood in the 1950s when pharmacists stocked a wide range of components for making up home remedies. They could be purchased by members of the public in small quantities or made up in the pharmacy on request (Combes, 1981). Home remedies in widespread use at the time included Bonnington's Irish Moss cough mixture, different brands of indigestion tablets, California syrup of figs (a laxative), gripe water for babies, and the patent medicines brought round by the Rawleigh's man.6 Our local chemist made up his 'own brand' range of basic products in brown glass bottles, labelled with his credentials. Diarrhoea and vomiting (sometimes known euphemistically as 'summer sickness') were subject to a range of recommendations for home remedies that were supposed to 'settle the stomach' including grated apple, dry toast, a Rawleigh's product known as Pleasant Relief, flat lemonade, and even ice cream. Basic products and the patent medicines along with aspirin, beef tea, and bed rest were used as supportive care in the days before vaccinations were available for measles7, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. All children were expected to contract them at some stage and my siblings and I were no exception. Non-ingested products such as antiphlogistine for boils, hydrogen peroxide and antiseptic dyes for skin abrasions, thrush and tinea, salt water gargles for sore throats, and camomile lotion for bites and skin rashes were also common. From my own experience, the remedies used were largely limited to treating an illness or skin infection; it was not usual to take a product for prevention apart from patent medicine 'tonics' that were available. Vitamin C tablets appeared in our household for the first time during the mid-1960s as a protection from winter colds and bronchitis, and during the late 1960s large fizzy 6 Rawleighs: a Australasian company that sold patent medicines and cooking essences door to door. It still exists today though the method of sale and the range of products have changed, see https://www.rawleighs.com/ 7 The first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 (Bloch et al 1985), with the others following. 32 tablets containing 1000mg doses of Vitamin C became a remedy for hangovers after student parties among some of the young men I knew. Developments in medical care that offered more treatments with prescribed antibiotics, anti- fungals and anti-histamines beginning in the 1940s became more widely available during the 1950s (Gaynes, 2017). In the following couple of decades, the advent of mass production of pre- packaged medicines saw many of the home remedies become outdated or the substances needed to make them no longer readily available. Compounding by community pharmacists was less necessary except in specialised cases, and is now likely to be less than one percent of prescriptions according to Krochmal (2009). Moreover, pharmacists were reluctant to stock ingredients for which there was only minor demand and which had to be discarded before their expiry date (Louise Kennedy pharmacist, personal communication). 'Own brand' basics and ingredients for home remedies were gradually replaced by commercially produced products that could be bought off the shelf or ordered independently in an increasingly globalised market. These were sometimes simply older remedies in a new guise. Garlic, for example, which has been recognised as having medicinal properties since ancient times (Rivlin, 2001), no longer needs to be peeled, crushed and ingested in its raw state but can be bought in a pharmacy or health food store as a prepackaged concentrated and odourless extract known as Kyolic(r) (Balamash et al., 2012). So while the 'natural health' products on pharmacy and health store shelves may appear to be a new phenomenon, they would seem, rather, to be part of a long continuum of obtaining substances to treat illness or maintain health that is connected to the history of humanity from earliest times. The difference is that the physical substances formerly used in home remedies and self-care have been reimagined, repackaged and marketed in a way that resonates with the contemporary citizen and can be obtained over-the-counter in a convenient ready-made form. 33 Chapter 3: Methodology and methods Introduction The key focus of my research was to gain an insight into the perspectives of people who used supplements regularly. I wanted to find out why they first started to take supplements, how they decided what to take, and what kind of effects they reported on their health and wellbeing. I was also interested in their sources of information about supplements, how they chose where to buy them and what their general relationship was with the orthodox health system. In addition I was interested in investigating whether people who used supplements were influenced by social attitudes and discourses that were evident in popular and academic publications and how these related to contemporary and historical ideas and expectations of health, illness and wellbeing throughout the life course. When I started out on the study, I had thought that building a greater understanding of the reasons people chose to use supplements might give a greater insight into the criticism that supplement use attracts in orthodox health care and perhaps go some way to reconciling the disparate views between users and critics. As the study progressed, however, I discovered that it was more important to examine supplement use as a practice in its own right rather than attempting to compare it to or reconcile it with other views. Epistemological approach A fundamental consideration in qualitative research is the ontological and epistemological position of the researcher; that is, their beliefs about what it is possible to find, and how to go about finding it (Giacomini, 2010). The individual researcher's beliefs about the nature of reality shape his or her view of the world; they affect how they approach the topic, how they generate and analyse the data and how they view the topic within the broader social and political context (Giacomini, 2010; Green & Thorogood, 2009). Realist assumptions assume that facts are stable and independent of values, and that researchers can and must distance themselves from the data and take an objective stance (Green & Thorogood, 2009: 13). Constructionists on the other hand, consider that reality is shaped by human processes that influence how the material world is experienced and interpreted and that one person's reality will differ from another's. Extreme constructionists take the view that all reality is relative and depends entirely on how it is constructed by human processes (Green and Thorogood 2009). An individual researcher may sit anywhere along this spectrum from positivist assumptions that reality is fixed at the one end, to 34 extreme constructionist view that nothing has independent reality and everything is relative at the other end. This study started from a constructionist standpoint in which I took the view that while reality exists, human beliefs and attitudes have a major influence on how people perceive and engage with it. Moreover that each individual will construct these influences in different ways and that their beliefs will change over time according to new experiences that they have, and new ideas they come across, as well as their own stage in life (Tulloch & Lupton, 2003). People's constructions of the world are developed as the result of an interaction between their own private, cognitive processes and their exposure to the publicly shared discourses and social norms of the age they live in (Giacomini, 2010). My study aimed to understand more about the phenomenon of supplements and their use by investigating perspectives and subjective experiences of the individual participants by talking to them and so gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding from their point of view (Kelly, 2010; Liamputtong, 2013). As the study progressed, however, it became obvious that the role of the supplement products themselves needed to be included as an important part of the study. This led me to consider a post-humanist element in the overall approach so that these products could be given due consideration. Post-humanism or materialist thinking, encompasses a diverse range of ideas (Bennett, 2010, 2012; Braidotti, 2006; Coole & Frost, 2010; Law, 1999), but they are all consistent in contesting the binary opposition that sees matter as simply inert and passive until humans take an interest in it (MacLure, 2015: 96). This way of thinking disturbs the privileged position of human agency and the primary importance it accords to human \"language, discourse, culture and values\" (Coole & Frost, 2010: 3). It acknowledges that material factors are influential in what happens both in individual lives and more generally within society. Matter is seen as having agency of its own, and that it can be \"...active ... productive, unpredictable\" (Coole & Frost, 2010: 9). Bringing matter back into consideration does not mean excluding the human, but rather restoring materiality to its place and recognising that matter and discourse come together \"...in complex and shifting arrangements from which the world emerges\" (MacLure, 2015:96). To write about both the human and non-human in the context of this study, I have chosen to use the term 'actants'. Actants is a neutral term which simply describes the many and various elements that come together in a phenomenon and avoids the limitations of language that always categorises people and things as being essentially different in their capacities. An actant 35 can be any entity, whether human or non-human, that \"modifies a state of affairs by making a difference\" (Latour, 2005: 71); people, material things, discourses, practices, relationships, or concepts. Using materiality thinking to examine supplements and supplement practices made it possible to incorporate any actants which proved to be important in the study and allowed a greater range of insights than would have been possible by focusing on human discourse alone. Venturing into a post-humanist approach and combining it with the study's original constructionist intention created a number of tensions in bringing these potentially divergent approaches together. Nevertheless there were compelling reason for including both. Much of the data entailed participants' perceptions about what was natural, holistic and safe about supplement practices. I believed that constructionist analysis was the most fitting way to do justice to these data, which had been generated through talking to participants, and was the dominant mode of investigation throughout the study. On the other hand, I considered it equally important not to leave aside the unexpected demonstrations that had occurred during the interviews about the role that the material products played in their lives. This dual approach was a direct result of being confident enough to stay with one of the core strengths of qualitative research, that is, the researcher needs to remain open to being surprised by developments that come to light in the course of their investigation and not set them aside if they do not fit with prior intentions or assumptions (Green & Thorogood, 2009). A number of authors have listed criteria against which qualitative research should be measured, citing characteristics such as validity, reliability and transferability (Pope & Mays, 2006) or credibility, authenticity, dependability and confirmability (Liamputtong, 2013). Lists of desirable qualities, however, tend to raise more questions than they answer. These terms are \"quite loose and imprecise as far as criteria go...and are themselves subject to interpretation...and seem resistant to ever being translated into relatively stable and general standards\" (Smith, 1990: 185- 186). I found that a more helpful approach was Liamputtong's general comment that \"validity lies more in a subjective, human estimation of what it means to have done something well, to have made an effort that is worthy of trust and to have written it up convincingly\" (2013: 43) This was the guidance I attempted to follow in being clear about the evolving process that resulted in moving between a constructionist and a post-humanist approach in different parts of the thesis. 36 Reflexivity One measure of being trustworthy as a researcher working within a constructionist frame is to acknowledge that they do not sit outside the data as an authority who creates categories that interpret and explain the subjects of the research. Rather they need to consider how their own experience, context and broader world view may influence what is found (Green & Thorogood, 2009: 23; Liamputtong, 2013: 29-30; Potvin et al., 2010: 447). They need to reflect critically on the preconceptions and values that they bring to the topic and subject them to the same analysis that they use with the data (Green and Thorogood, 2009). Essentially the researcher needs to acknowledge that a completely objective and value-free stance is not possible, and that their findings from research will inevitably be coloured by their own views and experience. Malterud (2001:484) defines this as \"the knower's mirror: an attitude of attending to the context of knowledge construction, especially to the effect of the researcher, at every step of the research process.\" That means researchers need to examine how their own assumptions and background have influenced their choice of topic, their research methods, and the analyses, interpretations, and writing methods that contribute to the final result (Bourke, 2014; Moser, 2008; Wiederhold, 2015). Rather than this being a disadvantage, explicit acknowledgement of personal and intellectual preconceptions enhances rather than detracts from the credibility of the research findings as the different ways that each researcher approaches the same subject help to generate a more complex understanding of the phenomenon in question (Malterud, 2001). In the following paragraphs, I set out my reflections on my own prior experience and assumptions I brought into the research. As a mature student with a wide range of life experience over more than six decades, I believed that I came to the topic with the advantage of having witnessed many changes in social thinking that had come about over this time. I had lived through major changes in technology and communications, advances in treatment and prevention of health and disease, the globalisation of trade and dissemination of goods, and an increasing diversity of the New Zealand population through immigration. Another important difference from my early years had been the change over the last 60 years from beliefs that nature was there to be used by humans for their purposes and benefit, to the belief that the natural environment must be protected from exploitation and sustained for generations to come. These changes had brought new ideas, discourses, and practices that were widely different from the homogeneous society of my childhood in the 1950s and I believed they had all played some part in contemporary notions of health and illness and had an influence on the use of supplements. 37 On a personal front, I was also well aware that I had led a secure and relatively privileged life compared to many others. I had the advantage of a stable upbringing and had enjoyed access to a wide variety of educational and occupational experiences across a variety of fields. I had studied and worked in the humanities, then in health sciences information, and over the last several decades in public health and primary health care research. I was conscious of the fact that this experience would have inevitably influenced how I thought about supplements and their users, and that I would need to guard against a potential tendency on my part to privilege the accounts of people who were more like me, and perhaps to place less credibility on those reporting attitudes and behaviour in relation to supplement use that was beyond what I would be comfortable with. Yet I was also aware that participants whose views were framed by a different world view from mine (that is, without the same longstanding exposure to the academic and health world), would be the most likely to contribute new and unknown information that would enrich my study. Although I used supplements myself from time to time, particularly to ward off respiratory infections, it was not something I had given much thought to or felt strongly about before the piece of previous research which had aroused my interest. I also believed I had a relatively neutral position towards the orthodox health system, seeing its practitioners as necessary and valuable, particularly in acute care. At the outset of my study, I believed I had no fixed opinion either for or against supplement use and believed I had a good grasp of the main issues. Just how superficial this turned out to be became apparent as I progressed through the study and heard the diverse views of the participants. It was oddly reassuring, however, as it confirmed that the topic I had chosen was worthwhile investigating in depth. The contact with the participants, the settings in which we met, the data itself and the reading and theory I examined opened up a whole new range of ideas about supplements and insights about their place in people's lives and at a more complex level than I had considered previously. Jackson and Mazzei (2012:6) have remarked on the way a researcher's memory of the interviews and their interactions with the participants, their personal and professional knowledge and their \"shifty selves as researchers\", inevitably has an effect on the way they think. This very much reflected what happened to me during the course of the study where my own thinking evolved in unexpected directions as a result of my experiences in conducting the research and becoming immersed in the theory and data. I note in the following chapters the instances where this happened. 38 Methods I chose in-depth interviews as being the most suitable method of generating data for this study as they work well with an inductive approach when new and unknown information is being sought to fill a gap in knowledge about a topic (Pope & Mays, 2006; Rice & Ezzy, 1999). A key advantage of in-depth interviews is that they allow time for the perspective of one individual to be explored in detail, so producing new knowledge through the interaction between the interviewer and interviewee (Kvale 2007 cited in Liamputtong, 2013: 52). They also avoid a participant being interrupted or dominated by the ideas of another person as can sometimes happen in focus groups."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Piper excelsum', 'medical_conditions': ['diarrhoea'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Leptospermum scoparium', 'medical_conditions': ['diarrhoea'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Hebe salicifolia', 'medical_conditions': ['diarrhoea'], 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

The sacred plants of Dionysus.Ch. Brakatselos, F. Delis, P. Lekkas, M.Z. Asprogerakas, K. Antoniou, M. MarselosDepartment of Pharmacology, Medical Faculty, School of Health Sciences, University of Ioannina, GreeceIn antique pottery pictures depicting the celebrations for Dionysus, apart from vine plants (Vitis vinifera) and flasks of wine, there are also ivy wreaths (Hedera helix) -including ivy berries- that adorned the heads of god and his worshipers, usually bacchae and satyrs. In addition, most figures hold long sticks, originating from the flowering stem of the plant giant fennel (Ferula communis), with a pine on top of them (Pinus sylvestris). Euripides, in the tragedy Bacchae, mentions smilax (Smilax aspera) as another plant of the decorative wreaths. Ivy and smilax are climbing evergreen shrubs, which have been considered as symbols of the power of Dionysus to revitalize nature every spring. Nevertheless, the furious rituals pertaining to these ceremonial orgies, with wild dances in the rhythm of drums and flutes, impose the question whether the faithful followers of Dionysus were using inebriating herbs together with wine. We have put ivy, smilax and giant fennel under bibliographical scrutiny, in order to trace any possible role in the formation of \"medicinal\" wines. Of these plants, only ivy seems to fulfill such criteria. In some preliminary experiments of our lab, a water extract of homogenized ivy berries was administered orally to rats, either alone or in combination with a single ethanol dose (2,5 mg/kg). The observed behavioral profile revealed that the animals were affected in terms of motor response, exploratory activity and anxiety state.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 16520th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP057. Chemical analysis of essential oil and phenolic compounds isolated from ethyl acetate extract of Drama's Propolis (Macedonia, Greece).O. St. Tsiftsoglou, M. Koromili, T. Papagrigoriou, S. Klinaki, D. LazariAristotle University of Thessaloniki, Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, GreecePropolis has been used in folk medicine since ancient times. Nowadays, almost all bees products, such as honey and propolis, use as \"bio\"-cosmetics and as functional foods. Meanwhile, commercial interest to propolis is growing continuously. There is not a high concentration of volatile compounds in propolis, although their aroma and versatile biological activity and characteristic pleasant aroma make them important. Chemical composition of propolis depends on the local flora, geographic location and the site of collection. Hydrodistillation of propolis collected in Drama (2014) afforded yellowish essential oils. GC-MS analysis indicated that the predominant components of this essential oil were: g-cadinene (19.82%), a-eudesmol (12.03%), a-muurolene (9.25%), epi-a-muurolol (8.71%) and g-muurolene (8.48%). Moreover, a phytochemical study of the propoli's ethyl acetate extract led to the isolation of five known natural products: two flavonoids: chrysin (1) and pinobanksin (2) and three esters of caffeic acids: caffeic acid phenethyl ester (3), caffeic acid benzyl ester (4) and cinnamylcaffaete (5). The chemical structures of the isolated compounds were established by 1D and 2D NMR analysis (1H, 13C, gDQCOSY, gHSQCAD, gHMBCAD), and through comparison with the literature.Acknowledgements: The authors are grateful to Mr. PantelisVasilas who provides us with the sample of propolis.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org16620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP058.

This genus includes more than 150 species worldwide, among which 16 different species and subspecies are native to Greece (including 10 perennials and 5 local Greek endemics) [1]. Sideritis spp. are of great interest due to their pharmacological properties, such as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity [3]. According to previous phytochemical studies, Sideritis spp. are rich in secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, iridoids, phenylethanoid glucosides and diterpenes [2,3]. In this study, we collected the aerial parts of four species and/or subspecies from different areas of Greece: Sideritis euboea, S. clandestina subsp. peloponnesiaca and S. raeseri subsp. attica (local Greek endemics) and S. scardica (near threatened local Balkan endemic). The phytochemical profile of hydroalcoholic extracts was monitored using NMR spectroscopy. According to the spectra obtained, the main compounds of the examined extracts were phenolics (flavonoids and phenylethanoid glucoside). All the extracts were also tested for their biological activity using three in vitro techniques: the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, the inhibition of lipid peroxidation (AAPH), testing both the antioxidant activity, and the inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX), testing the anti-inflammatory activity. All the extracts showed strong antioxidant activity (>74.8%) with the DPPH method, compared to the reference substance NDGA. Moreover, there was not observed a reduction on the levels through the 60 min of this method. The extracts with the lipid peroxidation method and the inhibition of lipoxygenase showed no or low activity. [1] Dimopoulos et al. Englerra 31, 2013; Willdenowia, 2016, 46(3), 301-347. [2] F.

Leave samples from Cistus creticus were collected monthly from February to July 2018. The dried leaves were hydrodistilled in a Clevenger apparatus. The first fraction of the essential oil, collected after one hour, contained most of the volatile ingredients. The distillation was continued for 24 hours to yield the rest of components. To our surprise, the essential oil of the February sample yielded (1) with purity above 99% and was completely void of (2) and any other volatile substances. The same procedure was followed for the samples of the following months, and a mixture containing only (1) and (2) was isolated. Over time, Manoyl oxide increased by up to 40% of the total mixture. Due to the structural similarity of the two molecules it was not possible to separate them by any of the common analytical techniques. Separation was finally achieved by column chromatography using a mixture of neutral alumina-silver nitrate as filler material. All compounds were identified by 1- and 2D NMR, GC/MS, and optical rotation measurements.

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "3 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 1.4.1 The Origins of Traditional Herbal Medicines Human beings have evolved alongside plants, which have been used as food and medicine for millennia (Chevallier, 2007). People learnt by trial and error which plants, seeds, berries and fruits were good to eat; as a consequence they became aware of the potential health benefits. Hatfield (2007) suggests the precise origins of HMs are unclear, but it is likely to have occurred as a by-product of the use of plants in other ways; for example, chewing the leaves of a particular plant may have caused the mouth to feel anaesthetised, leading to the plant being used for toothache, or a plant rubbed on the skin to wipe a wound may have helped it heal establishing its use in wound healing. The knowledge of which plants are medicinally beneficial comes from their use as food and traditional cultural backgrounds (Chevallier, 2007). Folk practice of medicine, using plants to treat and prevent diseases, began as an oral tradition and has been passed down generations, long before written records were created (Hatfield, 2007). Around the world there are many different cultures which have created their own system of traditional medicine to diagnose, prevent and treat illnesses (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011). Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medical system, is believed to be more than five-thousand years old, and is said to be one of the oldest medical systems known; it is a holistic approach to managing health and preventing disease (Williamson, 2002; Sharma et al., 2007). Ancient Chinese traditions dating back to the Stone Age claim that man gradually learnt to recognise the properties of plants, and then used them as medicine (Hong, 2004). Egyptian papyrus scripts as early as 3000 BC found preserved, contained hundreds of hieroglyphics detailing specific medical conditions and herbal treatments (Ehrlich, 2011). Pedanius Dioscordes the famous Greek physician published the first European herbal pharmacopoeia, around 65 AD, called De Materia Medica. Dioscordes organised all the plants in a systematic manner, grouping plants with similar pharmacological actions together (Isely, 1994). More recently Saslis-Lagoudakis et al. (2011) demonstrated the applications of phylogeny in mapping the pharmacological properties of ethnomedicinal plants and bioscreening. Their phylogenetic study comparing cross cultural uses of ethnomedicinal plants uncovered that similar traditional uses were found in different areas where the related species were available. Throughout history and across the globe plants have been used as the primary source of medicine (Hatfield, 2007). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2003), \"Traditional medicine refers to health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses or maintain well-4 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra being\". WHO (2008) clarifies that the terms complementary/ alternative/ non-conventional medicines are used interchangeably when referring to traditional medicines, and the terms allopathic/ conventional are used to refer to Western medicines. Herbal medicines form an integral part of Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM), which is a broad term used to describe hundreds of therapies including: massage, nourishment, exercise, and HMs (Kayne, 2002). For the purpose of this study the terms herbal medicine(s), traditional herbal medicine(s), herbal remedy/remedies, and traditional herbal remedy/remedies will be used interchangeably. 1.4.2 Herbal Medicines as Drug Leads Approximately 25% of drugs prescribed worldwide are derived from plants (Sahoo et al., 2010); for example, aspirin based on the chemicals found in willow bark (Salix spp.) is used for pain relief and anti-platelet effects, and digoxin from the foxglove plant (Digitalis lanata Ehrh.) is used for cardiac disease (Hartmann, 2007; Li and Vederas, 2009). Metformin, an oral anti-diabetic drug, often the first line treatment for type 2 diabetics is also derived from plants. It originates from French lilac or Goat's rue (Galega officinalis L.) a plant used in traditional medicine for centuries, with the first references documented in 1500 BC by Egyptian physicians (Witters, 2001). The use of papaverine from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) as a vasodilator led to the development of verapamil for hypertension. More commonly known are the opioid analgesics codeine and morphine for pain relief which are also derivatives of the opium poppy (Cragg and Newman, 2013). In 1820 French pharmacists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Caventou isolated and purified quinine from the bark of the cinchona tree (Cinchona officinalis L.) which was used to treat malaria. The traditional use of quinine for treating fever and infectious disease dates back to the 1600s (Achan et al., 2011). Since then quinine has formed the basis of the development of other anti-malarial drugs such as cholorquine and mefloquine. More than 60% of cancer drugs on the market or being researched are based on natural products (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011); including the vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine isolated from the Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus L.) (Cragg and Newman, 2013). Over the past hundred years developments in technology have revolutionised health care across most parts of the world, where once HMs were the only source of medication (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011). Plants have the ability to synthesise a variety of chemical compounds which can be consumed by humans for maintaining health, treatment and prevention of disease. Advances in chemistry have made it possible to extract, isolate, and 5 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra synthesise compounds from natural products. This has been a contributory factor to the decline in use of plants for primary care and a rise in the use of synthetic drugs (Sahoo et al., 2010; Dias et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the search for potential therapeutic agents continues, with nearly half of the small molecules approved in this decade having originated from natural products (Kong et al., 2009; Pandikumar et al., 2011). As the process of drug discovery is becoming more expensive, reverting back to traditional remedies may provide a cheaper alternative for pharmaceutical companies (Patwardhan and Khambholja, 2011). Patwardhan and Mashelkar (2009) claim that as natural products have been used for a long time, there is more information available on tolerance and safety compared with the development of novel synthetic drugs which have never been used before. However, most of this traditional knowledge is still not documented or supported by clinical trials. Patwardhan and Mashelkar (2009) propose a \"reverse pharmacology approach\" whereby products traditionally known to have clinical effects are scientifically tested; they go on to say, \"The novelty of this approach is the combination of living traditional knowledge such as Ayurveda and the application of modern technology and processes to provide better and safer leads.\" Natural resources which have been traditionally used by indigenous people have been commercially exploited by corporations; this is known as biopiracy (Robinson, 2010). Several high profile cases of biopiracy including basmati, neem and turmeric have led to the development of guidelines to protect indigenous knowledge and resources (Robinson, 2010). In 1995 two scientists in America got a patent for the use of turmeric in wound healing. The patent was revoked in 1997 after a complaint was filed by India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, who highlighted that turmeric had traditionally been used in wound healing for thousands of years (Nobel, 2014). Since then a database (Traditional Knowledge Digital Library) to document traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and ancient formulations has been developed by the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) to protect traditional knowledge from being exploited by biopiracy (Gupta, 2011). Patenting laws to protect indigenous species have been introduced in several countries including China, India, Peru and the Philippines (Robinson, 2010). Scientists are continuously exploring the benefits natural products offer in anticipation of discovering new drug leads and developing novel drugs. Ayyanar and Ignacimuthu (2011) suggest further ethnopharmacological studies are required for discovering potential new drugs. 6 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 1.4.3 The Use of Herbal Medicines Hatfield (2007) declares that the use of medicinal plants is part of our heritage, but fears this valuable knowledge is on the brink of extinction. Despite this, it is estimated that in some developing countries more than 80% of the population depend on HMs for primary health care (WHO, 2008). Up to 90% of the population in Africa and 70% in India depend on traditional medicine to meet their healthcare needs (WHO, 2005). This could be due to poverty, a lack of access to or knowledge of modern medicine (Ayyanar and Ignacimuthu, 2011). In India the HMs market is immense; 960 medicinal plants have been widely incorporated into the HMs industry, of which 178 have been identified as high volume due to popularity and demand (Sahoo et al., 2010). However, the use of HMs is not limited to developing countries; over the past few decades interest in HMs in developed countries has been rising (Ernst and White, 2000; Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). In Europe, Germany and France are leading in over-the-counter (OTC) sales of HMs, which are readily available even in conventional pharmacies (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011). The WHO (2003) factsheet on traditional medicines claims that in Germany 90% of the population have used a natural remedy at some time in their life. The HMs market value is steadily growing; the annual expenditure on CAM in Australia, Canada and the UK, was estimated to be worth US$ 80 million, US$ 2400 million, and US$ 2300 million respectively (WHO, 2002a). In the United States of America (USA) the use of CAM has been steadily increasing since the 1950s (Kessler et al., 2001); in 2011 the annual retail sales value of HMs in the USA was estimated to be over US$5.2 billion (Blumenthal, 2012). According to market research conducted by Mintel (2009), complementary therapies including Ayurvedic medicines, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and homeopathic remedies are becoming more popular in the UK. The report titled 'Complementary medicines- UK, December 2009,' (Mintel, 2009) identified that the number of people trying complementary medicines was increasing, with over twelve-million people reported to have used them in the UK in a single year. In 2009 the UK's complementary medicines market was worth PS213 million, and a 20% growth was predicted for the next two years (Mintel, 2009). A survey to explore the publics' perceptions of HMs in the UK in 2008 was commissioned by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The results uncovered that 35% of the population surveyed claimed to have used HMs (Ipsos MORI, 2008). In 2013 a review of ten surveys based on UK patients and HMs consumers indicated that on average 37% of the population used HMs (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2014). The UK HMs market is relatively strong, especially with a diverse ethnic population that is interested in non-Western alternatives (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2014). Wachtel-Galor and Benzie (2011) suggest some of the reasons people use HMs include: cost (i.e. 7 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra more affordable than conventional therapies), part of traditional background, HMs perceived to have less adverse effects than chemical alternatives, to replace or supplement CWM, and the notion of natural medicines being safer. 1.4.4 Potential Problems with Herbal Medicines Destruction of Natural Resources There may be important implications for the sustainability of natural resources; as the increasing demand for HMs could lead to overharvesting of endangered species and destruction of natural resources (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011; Booker et al., 2012). Alam and Belt (2009) claim, \"Medicinal plant species are depleting at a rapid pace due to large-scale, unsustainable collection from their natural habitats.\" According to one estimate over four thousand economically important species are threatened with extinction due to commercial over-harvesting to meet manufacturers demands (Schippmann et al., 2002). There are approximately 29,000 plant species protected by the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) (Hollingsworth et al., 2011); for instance, American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is native to the USA and can only be legally harvested in nineteen states with special restrictions controlling the growth, harvesting, sales, and export (US Fish and Wildlife Services International Affairs, 2015). In Europe there are several plant species which are listed as European Protected Species (EPS) under the European Habitats Directive, including shore dock (Rumex rupestris Le Gall), traditionally used as an astringent, and marsh saxifrage (Saxifraga hirculus L.) (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2014). The conservation of medicinal plants is of paramount importance as they remain an important source for natural ingredients for HMs, and there are potentially many more active compounds yet to be screened (Alam and Belt, 2009). Standardisation of Herbal Medicines Due to natural variance in the chemical composition of plants it can be difficult to standardise HMs (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011). Factors such as the climate, soil, genotype, parts of the plants used, time the plants are harvested, storage, drying, and manufacturing process can all affect the chemical composition of medicinal plants (Shaw et al., 2012); making it difficult to ensure the reproducibility of HMs (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). Manufacturers of HMs are required to standardise and quantify the active constituents 8 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra in formulations according to Pharmacopoeia standards (Waimer and Schwabe, 2011); however, if the raw plant material is consumed or unregulated formulations are used it is difficult to ascertain the chemical composition of the herbal remedy. HMs used in the UK come from all over the world, from a range of traditional medical systems including TCM and Ayurveda; therefore, problems with nomenclature and standardisation of names can occur (Shaw et al., 2012). In the USA and Europe the Latin binomials names are used as the official way of referring to plants; however, traditional names may be different and could lead to confusion when selecting the plant species. For example, in the Philippines ginseng was popular for its use as a male aphrodisiac but this \"ginseng\" was not the same as the ginseng which belongs to the genus Panax; instead it was Jatropha podagrica Hook. commonly known as the Buddha belly plant (Begg and Gaskin, 1994; Bareja, 2010). It remains unclear how the Buddha belly plant was used instead of ginseng; it may have occurred as the plants looked similar, or due to the commercial value of ginseng whereby the Buddha belly plant was a cheaper alternative. When the traditional and binomials names of species are different it increases the risk of species substitution and adulteration, which may be accidental or deliberate. The Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, has created a database called the 'Medicinal Plants Names Service' which is a resource for searching information about medicinal plant names. As different names may be used for the same plant (i.e. in different countries, communities, and languages) and even the Latin binomials themselves change; this database has collated all the relevant published information about medicinal plant names enabling more accurate communication and identification of medicinal plants (Medicinal Plants Names Service, 2015). Species Substitution and Adulteration Reports of commercially valuable species being substituted for cheaper alternatives have been documented (Vassou et al., 2015). Ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.Mey) has numerous health benefits; it has been used for fatigue, enhancement of mental and physical performance, and as a male stimulant (Chevailler, 2007). The rising demand for ginseng has led to an increased commercial value and a decline in natural resources. Dharmananda (2002) identified several cheaper and more abundant species which were used as substitutes for ginseng in TCM including: Codonopsis pilosula Nannf. (also known as dang shen or poor mans' ginseng) which is unrelated to ginseng but believed to have a similar action, Rumex madaio Makino and Talinum paniculatum (Jacq.) Gaertn. which look similar to ginseng roots. 9 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra A Chinese slimming aid in which Stephania tetrandra S.Moore had been substituted by Aristolochia fangchi Y.C.Wu ex L.D.Chow & S.M.Hwang caused renal damage in over one hundred patients in Belgium (Vanherweghem, 1998). Stephania tetrandra is traditionally referred to as 'Fangchi' or 'Fangji', while Aristolochia fangchi is referred to as 'Mu Fangchi' or 'Mu Fangji'; the similar traditional names may explain how the confusion of the species occurred (Sim et al., 2013). The chemical composition of the two species is very different; aristolochic acids found in Aristolochia species have been known to be nephrotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. The use of Aristolochia species has since been restricted and prohibited in several countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK (Vanherweghem, 1998; Michl et al., 2014)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Salix spp.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['pain relief', 'anti-platelet effects']}, {'scientific_name': 'Digitalis lanata Ehrh.', 'medical_conditions': ['cardiac disease'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Galega officinalis L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['anti-diabetic']}, {'scientific_name': 'Papaver somniferum L.', 'medical_conditions': ['hypertension'], 'medicinal_effects': ['vasodilator', 'pain relief']}, {'scientific_name': 'Cinchona officinalis L.', 'medical_conditions': ['malaria', 'fever', 'infectious disease'], 'medicinal_effects': ['anti-malarial']}, {'scientific_name': 'Catharanthus roseus L.', 'medical_conditions': ['cancer'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Rumex rupestris Le Gall', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['astringent']}, {'scientific_name': 'Panax ginseng C.A.Mey', 'medical_conditions': ['fatigue'], 'medicinal_effects': [' enhancement of mental and physical performance', 'male stimulant']}, {'scientific_name': 'Panax quinquefolius L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Saxifraga hirculus L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Panax', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Jatropha podagrica Hook.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Codonopsis pilosula Nannf.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Rumex madaio Makino', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Talinum paniculatum (Jacq.)

Centaurea ragusina L. Isolates' BioactivityCONCLUSIONIn this study, the most active compound has shown tobe a sesquiterpene lactone, ragusinin (compound 5) whosebiological activity has not been investigated so far. Currently, ourknowledge about the mechanism of action of STLs is still limited.Several of them reached clinical trials due to their ability to triggercell death in tumor but not in normal cells (Zhou and Zhang,2008; Kawasaki et al., 2009; Crespo-Ortiz and Wei, 2012).Here we are showing for the first time the biological activity ofcompound 5, ragusinin. Although ITC and CD results suggestedthat the cellular DNA is not the primary target of ragusinin in theliving cell, these data represent valuable information since, to thebest of found knowledge, STL-DNA interactions have not beencommunicated before.The variation of the amount of GSH in the cell by using aspecific precursor in GSH synthesis (NAC) or a specific inhibitorof GSH synthesis (BSO) showed the importance of GSH in thecell's response to 5. Moreover, it was shown that formation ofGSH-ragusinin conjugates increased cell survival what impliesthe role in GSH detoxification rather than in stabilization ofthe cell redox system. Ragusinin induced G2 arrest followed bycaspase-independent cell death.Though the actual protein targets remain unclear at thisstage of the investigation, we can confirm that compound 5 isdeactivated by GSH resulting in a diminished cytotoxic effect.A summary of the most significant results obtained in thisstudy by using specified techniques is presented in Figure 10.In future studies, it will be interesting to investigate whetherragusinin-GSH conjugates have a biological activity or whetherthey are ejected from cells through so-called GSH pumps such asMRP1 and MRP2 (Homolya et al., 2003).AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSUG and JR isolated and characterized compounds, analyzed thedata, and wrote a part of the manuscript.

PURPOSEFUL USE OFTOXIC PLANTS\"We did not escape without damage because [theIndians] killed another companion of ours ... and intruth, the arrow did not penetrate half a finger, but asit had poison on it, he gave up his soul to our Lord. \"(Francisco de Orellana, 1541)We have knowingly used poisonous plants asinstruments of punishment, torture, murder, andsuicide. As interesting as some of these episodesmight be, they are not the subject of this section. Iwant to concentrate instead on our use of plant toxinsin arrow poisons, in the little-known ritual known asthe \"ordeal,\" and on their use to kill fish, insects, androdents.ARROW & DART POISONSPeoples of both the Old World and the New Worldhave used many different plants in the preparation ofthese poisons. Native Americans on this continentused relatively few arrow poisons from plant sources,relying instead on rattlesnake venom and the juices ofthe black widow spider. The Indians of South Americaand the tribesmen of Africa used arrow poisons bothto hunt wild game and in wars against their enemies.CURARE. This is probably the most famous arrowpoison. The name is a phonetic rendering of an Indianphrase meaning, \"He, to whom it comes, falls.\" Otherspellings used in the literature are urari, woorari,woorali, and wourali. Curare is the name for a wholegroup of arrow poisons used in South America. Thefact that the ingredients and their relative proportionsvary from one location to the next hindered any realunderstanding of the botanical and chemical nature ofthe poison.The Baron Alexander von Humboldt was probably thefirst European to witness the preparation of curare. Hewrote that the Indians shredded bark of certain treesand made an infusion from it. This was furtherconcentrated by boiling it. Several other plantmaterials were added to the mixture.The Indians have several different ways of assayingthe strength of curare. One is to wound a frog with apoisoned arrow or dart. If it can jump more than eighttimes without the curare taking effect, then the potionis deemed too weak. Another test involves a monkeyjumping from tree to tree. When the curare is at itsproper strength, an animal should not be able to jumpto more than one tree before the toxin takes effect.And, a final test is that since the honor of preparingcurare often falls to the old women of the tribe, if theyare not half intoxicated by the fumes of the boilingmixture, the brew is not yet ready.The exact botanical nature of curare is still in somedoubt. The two principal toxic ingredients areStrychnos spp. (often S. toxifera) of the Logan-iaceaeand Chondrodendron tomentosum of the moonseedfamily (Menispermaceae).Three basic groups or kinds of curare are oftenrecognized, based upon the physical form in whichthey are prepared. Tubocurare, also known as tubecurare or bamboo curare, is cylindrical, having beenpacked in hollow bamboo stems. The two other kindsare gourd or calabash curare and pot curare.Chondrodendron is the principal ingredient in tubecurare; it is also used in pot curare. Strychnos is usedin both calabash and pot curare.The active ingredient is d-tubocurarine chloride ortubocurarine chloride, a whitish, odorless powder.Poisoning manifests itself in muscular relaxation byblocking of impulses between the nerve and themuscle fiber activated by it. Symptoms include:' impaired vision' bilateral drooping of lips' heaviness of face' relaxation of jaw' weakness of head muscles' inability to raise head' paralysis of spinal muscles, legs, & arms' slowed respiration, and' death.Curare is rapidly destroyed and excreted. Its actionusually lasts for about 15-20 minutes, during whichthe victim dies. The flesh of animals killed by curaremay be eaten.There are also medicinal uses for curare. Because it isa muscle relaxant, it may be used in the treatment ofconvulsive mental patients and in certain types ofsurgery. Curare is also used to diagnose myastheniagravis, a muscular disorder characterized by an overalldeterioration of muscle tone.KOMBI. The action of this African arrow poison wasfirst described in detail by Dr. David Livingstone, themissionary to Africa of \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume\"fame. He observed people preparing a poison from thefruits of Strophanthus, a member of Apocynaceae, thedogbane family. The action of kombi is much like thatof curare. The wounded animal rarely runs more thanabout a hundred yards before it falls. Kombi containsstrophanthin, a glycoside with digitalis-like effects. Itmust get into the blood stream, which means that theflesh of kombi victims is edible.Strophanthin also finds limited uses in medicine. It isused on heart attack victims when time is of theutmost importance. It takes effect much faster thandigitalis, but it is such a violent poison that thedosages must be carefully controlled.UPAS. This is an arrow poison used by the natives ofJava. The chief ingredient is Antiaris toxicaria ofMoraceae, the mulberry family.OUABAIN. The natives of tropical Africa prepare anarrow poison from Strophanthus gratus. A somewhatinferior brand can be made from Acokantheraschimperi and A. deflexa. Ouabain is the most rapidlyacting heart-glycoside known.-172-NEW WORLD ARROW & DART POISONSScientific Name (Family) Area of UseAconitum spp. (Buttercup) North AmericaAnemone spp. (Buttercup) North AmericaAnomospermum spp. (Moonseed) South AmericaCapsicum annuum (Nightshade) South AmericaCocculus spp. (Moonseed) South AmericaColliguaja odorifera (Spurge) South AmericaChondrodendron spp. (Moonseed) South AmericaConium maculatum (Parsley) North AmericaCynanchum macrophyllum (Milkweed) N.

The technique is notcomplex. It typically involves putting the required partof a particular plant in a still body of water. The planttoxin is released into the water, numbing the fish sothat it comes floating to the surface.The California buckeye (Aesculus californica) was usedby several tribes of Native Americans. Seeds,sometimes leaves or young stems, were crushed andmade into a mash that was floated on the surface ofthe water. The stupefied fish were then gathered byhand or in nets. The fish poison tree (Piscidia piscipula) of the beanfamily occurs in Texas, Florida, Mexico, the WestIndies, and South America. Its leaves, stems, and rootbark are macerated with a rum distillation residue orlime water. The material is then placed in baskets andfloated in the water until the stupefied fish surface.The plant contains piscidin, a mixture of two toxicglycosides.FISH POISONSScientific & Common Name Where Used ?Aesculus californica (California buckeye) CaliforniaChlorogalum pomeridianum (soaproot) CaliforniaClibadium spp. (Cunambi) AmazonConium maculatum (wasia) MexicoCroton setigerus (turkey mullein) CaliforniaDerris elliptica (tuba-root) AsiaEchinocystis fabacea (manroot) CaliforniaErythrina piscipula South AmericaHura crepitans (oassucu) South AmericaLomatium dissectum CaliforniaLonchocarpus spp. (barbasco) Tropical AmericaLycopus spp. (horehound) CaliforniaManihot esculenta (cassava) GuianaPatinoa sphaerocarpa AmazonPaullinia spp. (timbo) South AmericaPhyllanthus spp. South AmericaSapindus saponarius (amolli) MexicoSerjania spp. (timbo) South AmericaSmilacina sessilifolia (Solomon seal) CaliforniaTephrosia piscatoria South AmericaThevetia peruviana (jorro-jorro) BrazilTrichstema lanceolatum (blue curls) CaliforniaUmbellularia californica (pepperwood) CaliforniaWikstroemia spp. Hawai'iINSECTICIDESIn addition to the more exotic arrow and ordealpoisons, the plant kingdom yields useful poisons forthe control of insects. About 1200 different specieshave been used in this context, although onlyrotenone, pyrethrum, and nicotine are of any realcommercial value. One of these, rotenone, was usedfor centuries as a fish poison in South America beforeits use as an insecticide.Rotenone is a very popular insecticide derived fromthe roots of Derris and Lonchocarpus, both membersof the bean family. The former is native to the OldWorld tropics, while the latter is New World in itsdistribution. Rotenone was first isolated from Derris in1902. It is a colorless, crystalline compound extractedfrom the dried roots. Rotenone is insoluble in water,but soluble in oil. It is about fifteen times more toxicthan nicotine. The toxic principle has no effect onwarm blooded animals. Rotenone was isolated fromthe roots of Lonchocarpus in 1926. Its roots are richerin the toxin than those of Derris.Pyrethrum is the name given to the dried flowerheads of three species of Chrysanthemum. They yieldvolatile oils that paralyze insects. This came as nosurprise to horticulturists who knew that these plantswere rarely attacked by insects. Depending upon thespecies, the pyrethrum is often called \"Dalmatianinsect powder,\" \"Caucasian insect powder,\" or\"Persian insect powder.\" Pyrethrum has been usedsuccessfully in the control of flies, fleas, malarialmosquitos, and body lice.INSECTICIDES FROM PLANTSScientific Name (Common Name) CommentAnabasis ioaphylla Used in Near EastAnnona cherimola (cherimoya) Used against liceChrysanthemum cinerariifolium PyrethrumCroton texensis (croton) Used in New MexicoCymbopogon nardus (lemon grass) Citronella oilDelphinium spp. (larkspur) Seeds usedDerris spp. (tuba-root) Root source of rotenoneDolichos pseudopachyrrhizus Tropical Africa-173-Duboisia hopwoodii Leaves contain nornicotineEupatorium spp. (boneset) Eastern N.

Therefore, they are sometimes calledraticides. They are effective in small quantities, andappear to taste just fine.Squill or sea-onion (Drimia maritima) is aMediterranean member of the lily family. Since ancienttimes, its bulbs and extracts of the bulbs have beenused to kill rodents. If you or I eat this material, it willmake us sick and we will vomit, thereby ridding thesystem of the toxin. Rodents, on the other hand, haveno \"vomit control center\" in their brains so that anyplant parts consumed will remain in the stomach andbe absorbed. The sea-onion contains a series of toxinsthat affect the heart. They are called cardiacglycosides and they are chemically similar to thosefound in the foxglove plants. The sea-onion toxins,given by injection in moderation, have medicinal usesas diuretics, emetics, and expectorants.Sweet clover. One of the most pleasant smells ofrural areas is freshly mown pastures.

Cyril and Methodius\", Mother Theresa 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* j_klopcevska@yahoo.comIntroductionThe pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) which belongs to the genus Capsicum is a widely cultivated and distribut-ed vegetable crop (Huq and Arshad, 2010). It is consist-ed of carbohydrates, proteins, carboxylic acids, miner-als, vitamins, and other biologically active compounds. The green, yellow, orange, and red pepper colour is de-pendent on a carotenoid pigment profile. Capsaicin as the main capsaicinoid compound determined the pungency in the red hot pepper (Kumar et al., 2011). Although the pep-per is produced seasonally, it is consumed throughout the year in either various specialties or spices and oleoresin extracts (Huq and Arshad, 2010; Kumar et al., 2011). The pepper is not only popular spice, but it could also be used in plant based insecticide formulations (Huq and Arshad, 2010). The Capsicum annuum L. could be differed from shape, pungency level, colour, and content of biochemi-cal compound. The colour could be evaluated from sur-face and extractable colour aspects (Malacara, 2011). The red colour intensity is considered as the main quality attri-bute of the red pepper and oleoresins, since it influences on both consumer acceptance and commercial value. The surface colour is dependent on pepper species and condi-tions during growing, storage, and processing (Belovic et al., 2014). Many factors affect pepper colour loss such as photolytic and thermal conditions, as well as the oxidative degradation of carotenoid pigments (Belovic et al., 2014). Several different methods for the pepper colour evaluation, based on the surface colour measurement and profiling of the carotenoids are reported in the literature (Belovic et al., 2014). Surface colour measuring is the method for de-scribing colour changes closest to sensory visual percep-tion (Malacara, 2011). In this work the influence of the par-ticle size at extraction of pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk of red hot pepper of Macedonian origin was studied by the determination of the extract yield and surface CIE Lab co-lour values. Materials and methodsThe red hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L., spp. mi-crocarpum longum conoides, convar. Horgoshka) was grown in the locality Markova Cheshma, Prilep, Republic of Macedonia. Dried fruits of the red hot pepper were cut manually longitudinally with a knife. Pericarp was separat-ed from the seed, placenta, and stalk. Analytical grade pe-troleum ether (40-60 degC) was supplied from Merck (Ger-many). An analytical balance Mettler Toledo (Switzerland) was used for the sample weighing with 0.1 mg accuracy. The samples were ground using a Retsch ZM1 mill (Ger-many). The extraction of the red hot pepper (10 g +- 0.1 mg) was carried out with Soxhlet procedure using petro-leum ether (40-60 degC). After 420 min extraction, the sol-vent was removed at 40 degC, 200 mPa using a rotary evap-orator (Devarot Elektromedicina, Slovenia). The steps of S4 PP 187396Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 395 - 396 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsdrying, cooling, and weighing were repeated until the dif-ference between two consecutive weights was smaller than 2 mg. The yield of the extract was calculated based on the dry matter weight of the red hot pepper sample used. The extraction procedure was performed in duplicate under the same operating conditions. Visual colour of the samples investigated was evaluated measuring the CIE Lab coor-dinates L* (lightness-darkness), a* (red-green), b* (yel-low-blue), chroma (C), and Hue (hdeg) using Dr. LANGE spectra colorimeter (Chelmsford, UK). Colour difference (DE) was calculated from a*, b*, and L* parameters, using Hunter-Scotfield's equation (Ergunes and Tarhan, 2006). Results and discussionAt extraction with petroleum ether (40-60 degC), 6.42% extract yield was obtained from pericarp with 0.25 mm particle size. Increasing the pericarp particle size from 0.5 to 1 mm, the extract quantity decreased, from 4.60 to 2.68%, respectively. The extract yield from red hot pep-per placenta with 0.5 mm particle size was 7.05%. The dif-ference in the extract quantity obtained from the placenta with 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm particle size was 1.49%. At seed extraction, the highest quantity of the extract was obtained in comparison to pericarp, placenta, and stalk. The highest extract yield of 22.32% was determined at seed extraction with 0.5 mm particle size. The obtained stalk extract quan-tity was the lowest, 3.70, 2.98, and 1.98% with particles size of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mm, respectively. The empirical models tested showed a good agreement between experi-mental and calculated data for the extract yield (R2> 0.90). The values of colour parameters varied between the sam-ples of pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk of red hot pepper. According to the L* values, seed samples were character-ized by the brightest (72.28), while pericarp samples by the darkest colour (54.26). The determined values of the co-lour parameter L* for placenta and seed were close to each other (65.59). High values of redness, a* (32.11) and satu-ration, C (41.94) were measured for the pericarp samples. The estimated value of a*/b* ratio in seed was the low-est. Hue (hdeg) values were linear correlated (R2 = 0.9793) with the values for the ratio of red (a*) and yellow colour (b*). The values of the L*, a*, b*, and C decreased with increasing the sample particle size (p< 0.05). The sample with 0.25 mm particle size was whiter, vivid, and deep red in colour than samples with particle size of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm. The highest colour difference before and after extrac-tion with petroleum ether (40-60 degC) was determined for the pericarp with 0.25 mm particle size (DE = 27.12). In-creasing the particle size from 0.5 to 1.0 mm, DE for peri-carp was decreased from 22.72 to 14.78. The influence of the particle size during extraction of placenta is insignifi-cant. For placenta with 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm particle size, estimated DE values were 19.28 and 18.67, respectively. The lowest DE values were determined during stalk extrac-tion. The values of colour parameters for obtained extracts from pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk at extraction with petroleum ether (40-60 degC) correlated with the determined colour values of the samples before and after extraction. The colour of red pepper is controlled by carotenoids. Cap-santhin, capsorubin, and xanthophylls are responsible for the red, while b-carotene and zeaxanthin for the yellow-orange colour. The red colour of different spices of pep-per is mainly due to the biosynthesis of keto-carotenoids such as capsanthin and capsorubin (Ergunes and Tarhan, 2006). The published data for the surface colour were relat-ed to the pericarp as an edible part of the pepper fruits. The differences in the pepper varieties, the maturity degree of the pepper, as well as the influence of drying and process-ing conditions were studied using characteristics of the sur-face colour (Belovic et al., 2014; Zaki et al., 2013). Results for the visual colour samples of pericarp are in agreement with those reported in the literature (Belovic et al., 2014; Ergunes and Tarhan, 2006; Zaki et al., 2013).ConclusionThe extraction of pericarp, placenta, seed, and stalk of red hot pepper was carried out with petroleum ether (40-60 degC). The bigger particle size enabled to obtain less extract yield. The highest quantities were extracted from seed, while the lowest quantities from stalk. The colour differ-ences increased with decreasing the particle size. The high-est colour differences were estimated at extraction of peri-carp.

The most com-mon known essential oils are those from lemongrass, oreg-ano, peppermint, rosemary, thyme, cinnamon, and clove. A variety of volatile compounds such as terpenoids, phe-nol-derived aromatic and aliphatic compounds were deter-mined in the essential oil composition. The essential oils are recognized for their medicinal value such as analge-sic, sedative, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, and locally anaesthetic remedies. As a powerful natural products with bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal, antiparasitical, and in-secticidal properties, the essential oils take a significant place in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and food industry, as well as in agriculture (Husnu Can Baser and Buchbauer, 2010). Concerning the complex chemical composition, the essential oils could be easily decomposed. Oxidative and photolytic conditions resulted in a quality loss and reduc-ing of the biological activity (Bilia et al., 2014). In order to protect and to use in drug delivery systems, nanoencap-sulation of the essential oils was proposed due to their ca-pability of improving the solubility, stability, and effica-cy of essential oil-based formulation. Nanoemulsion is dis-persion of two immiscible liquids with droplet size ranging from 20 to 200 nm (Sole and Solans, 2013). Low and high energy methods are used in the development of nanoemul-sion formulation. The high energy method required the me-chanical energy such as an ultrasonic procedure and a high pressure homogenization. On the other hand, surfactants as emulsifiers either in aqueous phase titration or in sponta-neous emulsification low energy method are used (Schuh et al., 2014).The objective of this study was to develop stable nano-emulsions of wild oregano essential oil using low energy emulsification methods.Materials and methodsSurfactants: Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan mo-nooleate, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), Tween 20 (polyoxy-ethylene sorbitan monolaurate, Merck, Germany), and Span 80 (sorbitan monooleate, Fluka, Germany) were used. Propylene glycol (PG) was supplied from Aldrich (Germany). Wild oregano essential oil (Origanum minu-tiflorum) produced in Turkey was purchased from Inter Connection Group DOOEL (Republic of Macedonia). Mil-liQ PURElab Classic system (ELGA, USA) supplied ultra-pure water.. An analytical balance Mettler Toledo (Switzer-land) was used for the sample weighing with 0.1 mg accu-racy. A magnetic stirrer (type MM-530 Tehnika Zelezniki, Slovenia) and a vortex (EV-102 Tehnika Zelezniki, Slove-nia) were used in the preparation of the wild oregano na-S4 PP 188398Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 397 - 398 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsnoemulsion formulations.

Macedonia,2Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, R.Macedonia,3Faculty of Agriculture, Goce Delcev University, Stip, R. MacedoniaWith fast economic development and industrialization, a vast rangeof genotoxic chemicals were produced, and distributed in the envi-ronment. These chemicals adversely affect living organisms, and oftenlead to serious diseases to human being. Due to the highly conservedstructure of the genetic material, it is possible to use a broad varietyof species including bacteria, yeasts, animals and plants in genotoxi-city tests. Higher plants provide a useful genetic system for screeningand monitoring environmental pollutants. Recently, advances in mo-lecular biology have led to the development of a number of selectiveand sensitive assays for DNA analysis in eco-genotoxicology [Theodor-akis and Bickham 2004]. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)of these techniques can be used to detect genotoxicity and differ-ences in RAPD profiles and can clearly be shown when comparing DNAfingerprints from untreated and treated individuals to genotoxicagents [Atienzar et al. 2002; Enan 2006; Cenkci et al. 2009].The aim of the present study was to evaluate the DNA changes in-duced by toxic chemicals containing different metals (Cu, Mn, Pb, Ni,Cd and Zn) using RAPD technique in the plant model system treatedwith two selected concentrations and to investigate if plant bioassayscan effectively detect the genotoxic effects of toxic metals and mightbe useful for biomonitoring.The common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabaceae) was used as plantmaterial. This plant is exposed to heavy metals in his natural environ-ment as a result of various human activities. Plant seedlings weregrowth in sterile vitro containers containing liquid medium (untreatedcontrol treatment) [Murashige and Skoog 1962] or supplemented withCuSO4:5H2O, MnSO4:H2O, Pb(NO3)2, NiSO4, Cd(NO3)2 andZnSO4:7H2O as treatment solutions. The seedlings were treated withthe sollution of toxic chemicals at the concentrations of 150 mg L-1and 350 mg L-1 for 7 days in a growth chamber with a 16 h photoperiod,with light intensity of uE m-2 s-1. DNA extractions were performed usingREDExtract-N-Amp Seed PCR Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Amplifications wereperformed in a DNA thermocycler (Mastercycler personal, Eppendorf)using 5 steps PCR-protocol [Enan MR, 2006].The marked changes observed in RAPD profiles (disappearance and/orappearance of bands in comparison with untreated control samples)were evaluated. Numerical analysis based on banding pattern obtainedfrom treated samples was compared with the untreated sample (con-trol) via hierarchical cluster analysis using NTSYSps (Numerical Taxon-omy and Multivariate Analysis System) program with SAHN module[Rohlf 1994]. RAPD profiles generated by treated samples were differ-ent from those obtained using control DNA. The samples treated with350 mgL-1 of toxic metals yielded a large number of new fragments(total 11) compared with total number of new fragments (total 5) at150 mgL-1. Similarly, the total number of disappeared fragments was7 at 350 mgL-1, whereas at 150 mgL-1, the number of disappearedbands was 5. The highest number of missing bands was observed insamples treated with zinc (total 4 bands) and nickel (total 4 bands) atboth concentrations. The highest number of appearance of new frag-ments (total 3) is recorded in DNA samples treated with copper at con-centration 350 mgL-1. In our study, the number of lost bands was foundhigher than that of extra bands. The disappearance of normal bandsmay be related to the DNA damage (e.g. single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks, modified or oxidized bases, bulky adduct), point muta-tions and/or complex chromosomal rearrangements induced bygenotoxic chemicals [Atienzar and Jha 2006].The presence in the DNA \"fingerprint\" of any variable RAPD profilescan be evidence for genotoxicity and used for hazard identification ofenvironmental pollutants like xenobiotics. Plant bioassays can effec-tively detect the genotoxic effects and might be useful tool for bio-monitoring.referencesAtienzar FA, Venier P, Jha AN, Depledge MH (2002) Evaluation of the random ampli-fied polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay for the detection of DNA damage and mutations.Mutat Res 521: 151-163Atienzar FA, Jha AN (2006) The random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assay andrelated techniques applied to genotoxicity and carcinogenesis studies: a critical re-view.
