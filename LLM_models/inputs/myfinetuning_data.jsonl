Thereis much confusion as to their common names.ARROWROOTSThere are several unrelated Old World and New Worldroot crops that are collectively known as arrowroots.They are important starch sources that we use as foodin the tropics and for a variety of other purposes. Thestarch is deposited in tubers or rhizomes.THE ARROWROOTSMaranta arundinacea arrowroot, W. Indian a.Tacca leontopetaloides Tahiti a., African a.Curcuma angustifolia Bombay arrowrootZamia pumila Florida arrowrootManihot esculenta Brazilian arrowroot, Para a.Canna indica Queensland arrowrootArrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) is the best knownmember of the group. Its rhizomes are cleaned,peeled, crushed, grated, and then washed to free thestarch. The resulting liquid is then centrifuged orpoured on to a flat surface to allow the starch to settleout. The air-dried starch lumps are pulverized to yielda very fine, small-grained starch. The highly-digestiblestarch is a favorite in foods for infants and invalids. Itis also used in various jellies and pastes. The starch isalso applied externally as a face powder and to treatwounds, ulcers, insect bites, and snake bites. Mostarrowroot comes from St. Vincent, in the West Indies.The United States is the chief importer.Tahiti arrowroot is a favorite starch crop of the SouthPacific. Its tubers are treated to remove taccalin, abitter chemical. Besides being a food plant, the starchis also processed to make the coating used on carbon-less computer paper. Tahiti arrowroot leaves are usedto make hats.-63-TABLE BEET AND SUGAR BEETThe many cultivars of Beta vulgaris that we now useare presumably derived from B. maritima of northernEurope. Close relatives include chard (edible leaves)and the mangelwurzel, all of which freely interbreed.Our own production of the sugar beet increaseddramatically in the early 1960's, after we boycottedcane sugar from Cuba. The sugar in sugar beets isidentical to that of cane sugar. The main ingredient inborsch, a Russian soup, is a puree of beets. Beetrootwine is a popular homemade wine.CARROTDaucus carota var. sativa is another of our ancientfood plants. It is perhaps native to the Afghanistanarea. It was highly prized by Europeans and wasbrought to America by the early colonists. The carrotis a biennial, although the plant is mature after thefirst year. There are many kinds of carrots, some withenormous root systems three feet long. The carrot isrich in vitamin A and sugar. At first it was considereda medicinal plant, its seeds used as a stimulant and asa diuretic. After many centuries it was considered afood plant. Eating carrots raw is a very recent habit.The early cultivars were purple. The orange onesbecame popular when they were exported fromHolland in the 17th and 18th centuries.PARSNIPPastinaca sativa, a carrot relative, has been cultivatedas a food plant since the days of the ancient Romans.However, the development of fleshy roots did notcome until the Middle Ages. The parsnip is high insugars and starch. We also make parsnip wine.JERUSALEM ARTICHOKEHelianthus tuberosus is a close relative of our nativeNorth American sunflower. The common name wouldcertainly suggest otherwise. According to oneexplanation, \"Jerusalem\" is a corruption of the Italianword for sunflower. The plants produce tubers that aresomewhat like the potato in appearance. Althoughnative to the New World, the Jerusalem artichoke isbetter appreciated in Europe and China. In the UnitedStates it is most often used as a food for hogs. Wheneaten by humans it is usually boiled or baked. TheJerusalem artichoke contains inulin, a sugar that maybe used by diabetics.THE BRASSICA ROOT CROPSSeveral different root crops are derived from thegenus Brassica, a member of the mustard family. Theturnip is a combination of edible stem and roottissue. There is considerable variation in the size,shape, and flesh color in different cultivars. The turniphas been used since prehistoric times. The rutabagais of recent origin, the result of hybridization betweenthe turnip and the cabbage sometime in the 17thcentury. The kohlrabi is a leafy stem base. It can getto be about the size of an orange when fully grown,but it is best eaten before it gets that large.THREE S. AMERICAN ROOT CROPSThere are several South American root crops that arein wide use there, but which are almost completelyunknown to us in this country. Chief among them isoca (Oxalis tuberosa), a relative of our local redwoodsorrel or sour-grass. It is used primarily in Peru,Ecuador, and Bolivia. The tubers are acid when fresh.They are usually dried in the sun so that they getmore floury and less acid. If dried for several weeks,oca takes on the flavor of dried figs.Two other crops of note are the anu (Tropaeolumtuberosum), a relative of the garden nasturtium, andullucu (Ullucus tuberosus), an important Andean foodplant with no well known relatives in North America.-64-SURVEY OF ROOT CROPSCommon Name (Scientific Name) Plant Family Commentanu (Tropaeolum tuberosum) Nasturtium South American tuberarracacha (Arracacia xanthorrhiza) Carrot Used in Peruvian regionarrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) Prayer plant Starchy rhizomesarrowroot, African (Tacca leotopetaloides) Tacca Starch sourcearrowroot, Indian (Curcuma angustifolia) Ginger Starch sourcearrowroot, Queensland (Canna edulis) Canna Starchy rhizomeartichoke, Chinese (Stachys floridana) Mint See crosneartichoke, Japanese (Stachys floridana) Mint See crosneartichoke, Jerusalem (Helianthus tuberosus) Sunflower Native to North Americabeet (Beta vulgaris) Goosefoot Relative of sugar beetcarrot (Daucus carota) Carrot Native to Near Eastcassava (Manihot esculenta) Spurge Important pantropical foodceleriac (Apium graveolens) Carrot Used in soups and stewschavar (Hitchenia caulina) Ginger Used like arrowroot; Indomalaysiachicory (Cichorium intybus) Sunflower Coffee flavoring/substitutechufa (Cyperus esculentus) Sedge Tubers rich in starch, sugar, oil; pantropicalcrosne (Stachys floridana) Mint Edible tubers; popular in Europe, esp.

The flower clusters are often so immature thatyou may not realize what you are eating.ONIONS AND THEIR ALLIESThe edible portion of various Allium spp. is the bulb,a modified stem system bearing a series ofoverlapping, fleshy leaves. The outer leaves are oftendry and papery. The stem itself is reduced and is oftendiscarded before the rest of the bulb is eaten.Chives A. schoenoprasumEgyptian onion A. cepa var. proliferumGarlic A. sativumGarlic chives A. tuberosumKurrats A. ampeloprasumLeeks A. ampeloprasumOnion A. cepaPotato onion A. cepa var. aggregatumRakkyo A. chinenseRocambole A. ampeloprasumShallots A. cepa var. aggregatumTree onion A. cepa var. proliferumWelsh onion A. fistulosumONION. The onion (Allium cepa) is of uncertainorigin. The common name derives from the Latin(unio), the French (oignon), and the Anglo-Saxon(onyon). It was in use by the Egyptians in 3000 B. C.It was a common food in Europe in the Middle Ages.Long ago, the onion had another reputation. It \"...serves no other thing but to provoke and stirre folksto the act of carnal copulation. \"There are numerous cultivars. Yellow onions oftenhave golden-brown skins; red or Italian onions haveruby-red skins; white onions are white. The famoussweet and juicy Vidalia onion is named after the cityin Georgia.Why do we get all teary-eyed when we slice an onion?The cause is propanethial-S-oxide, a volatile sulfurcompound. It changes quickly to sulfuric acid, whichirritates our eyes and causes the tears. Put the onionunder water when slicing it to reduce the effect.GARLIC. This onion relative is another ancient plant.We have Egyptian inscriptions from 3200 BCE. Inthose days, garlic had a number of ceremonial uses.The Greeks and Romans ascribed magical propertiesto the plant. It was offered to the gods. Warriors ateit for added strength. It was also tied around babiesnecks to ward off evil spirits. Its medicinal uses alsodate to ancient times. Garlic was used to treateczema, toothaches, and snake bites.SHALLOTS. Shallots are not simply baby onions. Theyare a type of slender onion with a long neck andcopper skins. They have a more delicate flavor andthey dissolve more easily in liquids during cooking.LEEKS. This plant was also used by the ancientGreeks, Romans, and Egyptians. It is sometimescalled the \"King of the soup onions.\" CABBAGE AND ITS ALLIESWe have been eating Brassica oleracea for thousandsof years. It was a favorite of the Greeks and Romans.The Emperor Claudius once asked the Senate of Rometo confirm that corned beef and cabbage was indeedthe best dinner dish. Its wild ancestor may still befound along the coasts of Great Britain and Europe.Today cabbages are cultivated in almost everycountry, from the Arctic to the subtropics. This singlespecies is the source of an amazing variety of leaf,stem, and root crops. Some yield edible leaves, as inkale and collards; kohlrabi is an aerial stem;broccoli and cauliflower are edible leafy buds andimmature flower clusters, respectively. Headcabbage is essentially a large bud made up ofnumerous broad leaves. It is about 91% water, alongwith some lime salts and proteins. Slaw is merelyuncooked cabbage. In this form it is not too easilydigested and it is often boiled or steamed. We also eatpartially decomposed cabbage leaves in the form ofsauerkraut.Cabbage has a characteristic odor when cooked. Atabout the point when the leaves begin to soften, theygive off hydrogen sulfide. This is the smell that weassociate with rotten eggs and sewer gases. -66-OTHER EDIBLE LEAVESARUGULA. Also known as rocket, Eruca sativa is amember of the mustard family. It is native to Eurasia.I have added it to the syllabus because arugula isshowing up in our markets, especially in the fancysalad mixes. For a long time, its bitter, peppery flavorwas not that popular with Americans. The ancientGreeks and Romans enjoyed arugula. They ate it asan aphrodisiac, to balance the \"dampening\" effect oflettuce. Arugula adorned statues of Priapus, son ofAphrodite and Dionysus, and himself the Greek god offertility. He was also the protector of gardens andherbs.LETTUCE. Lactuca sativa, a member of the sunflowerfamily, is derived from the weedy wild lettuce (L.serriola) that is native to southern Europe and Asia.As in the cabbages, lettuce is another ancient plant.Early on it was used for a variety of medicinalpurposes. The leaves contain alcohols that have asoporific effect. Lettuce is 95% water; it has littlefood value. Several hundred cultivars are now in use.RHUBARB. Rheum rhabarbaratum is native to Asia.It is one of the very few food plants in which we eatthe leaf stalk (petiole) and throw everything elseaway. Many people mistakenly believe that the edibleportion is the stem and that the leaf is poisonous. It isthe leaf stalk that is edible and the leaf blade thatmust be discarded. The petiole is about 95% water,along with citric and malic acids. The blade containsoxalic acids, soluble oxalates, and other toxicsubstances in high enough concentrations to causepoisoning and even death in humans.CELERY. Apium graveolens, a member of the carrotfamily, is native to coastal marshes in Eurasia. Itsearly history is that of a medicinal plant, touted as acure for impotence, hangovers, constipation, and forits diuretic effects. Plants contain a family of chemicalscalled psoralens, that can cause severe allergicreactions in sensitive individuals."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Maranta

ROOT CROPSThis category of food plants includes those with edibleroots, underground root-like stems, subterranean leafbases, and combinations of these tissues. In otherwords, root crops are not limited to just those foodplants that have edible roots, as the name might wellimply. In general, root crops are:' mostly water;' high in starches and/or sugars;' low in proteins and oils;' not easily stored, transported, or marketed;' not the basis of a balanced diet;' sometimes consumed raw, but often requireheating or some other processing to destroytoxins.The annual tonnage of the major root crops is almostas great as the cereal production. They exceed themajor cereals in their nutritional yield in terms ofmillions of calories per acre: potato = 4.84; rice =2.77; maize = 2.55; wheat = 1.61.THE IRISH POTATO\"Two things are too serious to talk about - marriageand potatoes.\" [Old Irish saying]\"... a scarcely innocent underground stem. \"[John Ruskin, 1869]Also known as the Irish or white potato, Solanumtuberosum probably originated in the AndeanMountains of Bolivia and Peru. It has been in usethere since at least A.D. 200 and it is still in commonuse. The potato is a tuber, a starchy, underground-61-stem. The eyes are buds; leaf scars are also evidenton the surface. The tuber is about 70-80% water, 8-28% starch, and 1-4% protein. The food value variesgreatly with cultivar, growth conditions, storage, andhandling. In Solanum tuberosum, x = 12 and there are diploids,tetraploids, and hexaploids. The Tuberosum Group, towhich our cultivars belong, is tetraploid (2n= 4x =48).TIMELINE: IRISH POTATOBCE:11,000 First archaeological remains (Chile)5,000 Alkaloid-free diploids evolve5,000 Domesticated ? ?CE:1533 First seen by Europeans (Pizzaro)1553 First European reference (\"Chronica del Peru\")1570 Introduced into Spain1585 Introduced into Italy1586 Introduced into England1588 Introduced into Ireland1590 Jose de Acosta describes chuno making1597 First printed illustration (Gerard's \"Herball\")1601 \"It springs from a bulb\" (Clusius)1619 Gaspard Bauhin names it Solanumtuberosum esculentum1622 Governor of Bermuda sends them to Governorof Virginia1625 Now a food staple in Ireland1651 German Grand Elector forces their planting andconsumption1662 Royal Society considers planting throughoutEngland1664 John Forster publishes \"England's HappinessIncreased...\"1697 Introduced into Russia by Peter the Great1719 Introduced to U.

The potato was brought to Europe in themid-1500's and was planted extensively in NorthAmerica by about 1700. The plant was not animmediate success, for a variety of reasons. It wasseen to be a member of the nightshade family(Solanaceae), a group of plants long known for theirtoxic properties. There were also cultural and religiousbiases against the potato. Later its reputation changedand it became very popular. Often its planting was theresult of a royal edict. The potato became a dominantfood in the diet of the Irish. The \"late blight of potato,\"caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans, wipedout the Irish crops two consecutive years (1845-1847). It is estimated that 1.5 million died as a resultof the famine and that perhaps another millionIrishmen immigrated to the U.S.TOXICITY. When exposed to sunlight, potato tubersmake chlorophyll and turn green. They also increaseproduction of a toxin called solanine. It has causedsickness and death in domesticated animals that eatgreen tubers, but it rarely causes problems in humansbecause we destroy the toxin during the cookingprocess.USES.The potato is not just a food plant for us and forsome of our domesticated animals. Its starch is usedin textiles, paper, confections, and adhesives, and tomake industrial alcohol. Chicha is a South Americanbeer made from fermented potatoes. Schnapps is alsomade from potatoes.SWEET POTATOIpomoea batatas, a relative of the ornamentalmorning glory and the weedy bindweeds, is a trailingvine of tropical lowlands. The plants are vegetativelypropagated; many strains rarely flower. Its origin isstill a matter of controversy. It was probably used inboth the Old World and New World before Columbus.Current thinking appears to favor New World tropicallowlands as the sweet potato's ancestral home. Notethe similarities in common names:kumar * Quechua Indians (Andes)kumara * Polynesian islandsumara * Tahitiumala * Samoauwala * Hawai'iThe plant is very popular in the southern U.S., whereit is often called a yam. The true yams are entirelydifferent species and are rarely seen in this country.China is the leading producer of sweet potatoes. It has50% more calories than the Irish potato, usually lessprotein (1.5-2.0%), and is a good source of Vitamin A.The sweet potato is a polyploid (2n = 4x = 60 and 6x= 90).Henry VIII loved sweet potato pie. He thought that itwas good for his love life, a common belief of thetime. William Shakespear makes reference to thiswhen he has Falstaff hoping that the sky would rainpotatoes.CASSAVAManihot esculenta has a number of common names,including manioc and yuca (not to be confused withyucca, an entirely unrelated plant). Cassava is amember of the spurge family, known for its manytoxic species. It is a shrubby perennial of the tropicallowlands. It was originally from South America,perhaps eastern Brazil. In Africa and in the WestIndies, cassava is cooked and then pounded into adough to make fufu, a traditional African pudding.The plant is not widely known outside of the tropics,-62-although there it is a very important plant. While youmay not know a cassava when you see it, you doknow a product made from its roots - tapioca. Thestarch from cassava and maize were used to makepostage stamp glue.The edible part is a series of swollen roots. With littlecare the plants will yield 10 tons of roots/acre. Theroots contain a poisonous glycoside that will yield HCN(hydrogen cyanide or Prussic acid) when it breaksdown. We have learned by trial and error that theroots must be heated to drive off this toxic gas. Theroots are consumed whole after boiling, or pulverizedand dried to a meal called farinha. The juices are alsoused to make alcoholic beverages and as a componentin meat sauces (West Indian pepper pot).YAMSFirst, please note that yams and sweet potatoes arenot the same thing, and that while all of the sweetpotatoes belong to a single species, there are severalspecies of yams. Dioscorea spp. are perennial climbingvines of the tropics. Three \"Groups\" are oftenrecognized: Asian, African, and America. Only one, thecush-cush yam, is native to the New World. The vineshave large storage tubers that can weigh up to severalhundred pounds. The plants may have aerial tubers aswell. The yam is a very important food in the WestIndies, much of South America, in Asia, and the SouthSea Islands. It is baked, boiled, or ground into flour.The yam is mostly starch. Several million tons areproduced each year.In addition to being an important root crop, the yamhas ritual and medicinal uses. I will tell you about thatlater in the semester.THE TRUE YAMS (DIOSCOREA)New World:D. trifida Cush-cush yam, ajam, yampiAfrica:D. abyssinica RikuaD. cayenensis Yellow Guinea yamD. dumetorum Bitter yam, 3-leaved yamD. bulbifera Potato-yam, air-potatoD. elephantipes Elephant's footD. rotundata White yam, Guinea yamAsia:D. alata Greater yam, water yamD. bulbifera Potato-yam, air-potatoD. esculenta Lesser yam, Asiatic y., Chinese y.D. hispida Intoxicating yam, namiD. japonica Japanese yamD. nummularia KerungD. opposita Chinese yamD. pentaphylla Sand yam, buck yamD. praehensilis Bush yam, forest yamPacific Islands:D. papuanD. spinosa Spiny yamTARO\"One man's meal is another man's poi, son. \"(Restauranteur in Honolulu Polynesian bistro)' ' ' ' 'Colocasia esculenta, a member of the philodendronfamily, is very widely used by the peoples ofSoutheast Asia and the Pacific Islands.

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "One of the most important recasts that I have described has been the challenging of an evolutionary anthropology, which had its heyday in the 19th century, by a social and cultural anthropology in the early 20th century. The effect of this challenge was to flatten racist civilisational hierarchies through an insistence that we are all human subjects, regardless of cultural, social or geographical origin. We may well ascribe to different worldviews, adopt different cultural practices in efforts to, for example, heal ourselves, or enjoy different forms of food, but we are nonetheless all subjects whose practices are informed by worldviews, cultural values and social norms, as different as they may be. Indeed, it is exactly in its effort to map out these different worldviews, collective cognitive frameworks, and social norms that anthropology and sociology have reinforced this universally human subject. If anything, I would argue that Vietnamese regulators, herbal practitioners, doctors and community workers are well 'ahead' of their British counterparts when it comes to modernising, rationalising and industrialising the production, practice and use of herbal medicine. While distinctions between western and Vietnamese medicine certainly persist to this day, there has been a consistent call to \"unify\" and \"collaborate\" - reflected in the ways in which public health delivery is organised. Vietnamese chemists, botanists and pharmacologists have been travelling the countryside since the 1960s to collect folk remedies, and to collaborate with apprentice-trained practitioners in identifying medicinal plants and in modernising traditional remedies. In the United Kingdom, the Ethnomedica-research group with a similar mandate was set up as recently as 1999. Moreover, while practices of self-regulation by British herbalists date back to the mid 19th century, it was not until 2001 that a Herbal Medicine Working Group was set up to investigate the possibility of statutory recognition for herbal practitioners. In Vietnam, as we saw, traditional herbal practitioners have been actively recruited into the public health delivery system since the late 1950s. Now, to suggest that Vietnamese herbal practitioners, scientists and government officials have been somehow duped into modernising, rationalising and industrialising their herbal medicines by a hegemony of 'western rationalities' is in my view to completely miss the point, if not outright condescending. As already emphasised, whether herbal medicine in Vietnam is better or worse off following six decades of modernising, rationalising and industrialising or whether it could have been done better are questions that cannot be concluded on the basis of my analysis. What I can say without hesitation is that these 233 processes have been robustly and actively pursued by herbalists, doctors and government officials alike - not without disagreement or debate, but pursued nonetheless as described in my analysis. Histories of the present and their limitations In chapter 2, I made a point of distinguishing a history of the present approach to investigating the revival of herbal medicine in Vietnam and the United Kingdom from those of a sociology of health and illness, a sociology of professions, and a sociology of knowledge. In doing so, I wanted to emphasise that I would be asking a different type of question than would have been posed had I chosen one of these latter approaches. I also argued that the critical contribution my study would make would be one of troubling self-evidences and historicising practices rather than exposing shams or identifying shortcomings. As a direct consequence, there are of course many aspects of traditional herbal medicine in these two countries that have not been covered in the preceding chapters. I have not, for example, provided a detailed analysis of the regulatory and policy frameworks and processes within which herbal medicine has been mobilised in each of the countries. This would have entailed mapping out and following the processes of policy formulation, implementation and review. I could have spent many more hours speaking to Ministry of Health officials, and sifting through many more pages of legislation and policy proposals than I have. I could also have written an entire dissertation on recent efforts to professionalise and organise local district level associations of traditional practitioners in Vietnam or on ongoing efforts to unify herbal practitioners (whether Western, Chinese, Tibetan or Ayurvedic) in the United Kingdom under one umbrella professional association. Neither can I claim to be at this time an erudite expert in the teachings and texts of either Sino-Vietnamese medicine or western herbal medicine. I could certainly have committed myself to a much more in-depth immersion in the conceptual universes of Vietnamese and British herbal medicine and the medical texts upon which they have been built up. This would have entailed many more exchanges with herbal practitioners, and perhaps even concerted efforts to begin training myself in the art of herbalism. In the same way, I could also have concentrated my entire fieldwork on the phytochemical laboratories in which pharmacological work to understand the workings of herbal medicines and pharmaceutical work to improve extraction and production procedures are taking place. I could have followed the trials, errors and successes of the scientists and herbalists in the laboratories in 234 a much more detailed way, attempting to understand how they arrive at the findings they do, errors made along the way, and new challenges arising from their work. And finally, without having carried out ethnographic field observations and interviews I have of course not been able to provide a \"patient's eye view\" of herbal medicine use, its cultural meanings, the innovative ways in which people use herbal medicine in their day-to-day healthcare activities, or the functions it fulfils in generating individual coping strategies. It would have been fascinating, for example, to have identified a rural village in Vietnam where the \"Doctor at Home\" programme has been introduced and spent time looking at the everyday ways in which such programmes are adopted and/or rejected. Similarly I have not spent sufficient time with herbal practitioners in their practices observing the ways in which they interact with their patients, the challenges they face when working with biomedical doctors, or the microphysics of the power relationships that are emerging out of ongoing professionalisation efforts, to be able to provide a \"practitioner's view\" on herbal medicine in the two countries in question. With so much happening in terms of the professionalisation of British herbal medicine, it would undoubtedly have been rewarding to spend more time delving into the practicalities of this process, as well as the ways in which it is being received and debated. As I have already highlighted, the point to be made is that each of these limitations that have arisen on the back of the methodological choices I made to begin with, suggest fields of study which merit monographs in themselves - and indeed there are plenty of researchers who in fact are carrying out such studies. As such, a more pertinent point to reflect on when discussing the limitations of my approach regards the analytical findings and conclusions that I have summarised above. What is it that my study can tell us about British and Vietnamese herbal medicine and just as importantly what is it unable to conclude? My aim has been to establish the contours of the conditions of possibility that can help us to explain ongoing efforts to mobilise and revive British and Vietnamese herbal medicine. How have these efforts become possible? At the same time, I have also aimed to demonstrate that these efforts inevitably entail liabilities as well, and that one of the self-reflexive components of these efforts has been exactly to try and offset some of these liabilities by insisting on humanised and holistic processes of modernisation. This is a very different critical task than that which is perhaps characteristic of the sub-disciplines of medical anthropology and medical sociology, which have often explicitly worked to 235 demonstrate the shortcomings of a particular form of medicine (usually biomedicine) while advocating more 'holistic' or 'socio-culturally grounded' forms of medical intervention. The links between medical sociology and medical activism, as I have noted, are intimate. Nevertheless, it is of course standard fare to be asked of and held accountable for the normative contributions that academic endeavours like this current study deliver. And to answer this, I would highlight the conceptual moves proposed in the preceding chapters much more than any kind of practical reforms or improvements of regulatory or healing interventions that concern British and Vietnamese herbal medicine. As I demonstrated in the beginning of this dissertation, incommensurability between the modern and the traditional, biomedicine and alternative medicine, or holism and reductionism have permeated much of the research and policy work done in this field. If anything, this study has shown that, first of all, incommensurability becomes increasingly difficult to discern the further you delve into the microphysics of traditional herbal medicine. And, second of all, to the extent that there are incommensurabilities, these are increasingly being tackled and addressed as technical hurdles to be overcome. Perhaps this point would not have been as accentuated as it has been in my study had I chosen crystallography in the United Kingdom and traditional healing in Vietnam as my empirical sites rather than herbal medicine, or had I chosen to seek out those 'dissident' voices who resist all efforts to \"combine\" modern and traditional medicine in Vietnam, or to \"professionalise\" herbal medicine in the UK. Nevertheless, it should certainly be clear from my analysis that that which is celebrated as 'holistic' and 'human' has objectifying effects in the same way that a 'reductionist' and 'mechanistic' biomedicine is seen to have objectifying effects. And similarly, while traditional and alternative medicine are often highlighted for their subject-centred approaches to healing, biomedicine and the various theories of life that it encompasses without question also have subjectifying effects. And so, while one of the crucial limitations of a history of the present is its inability to provide concrete and stable proposals for reforming, improving or mainstreaming that which it studies (not least because any such proposals would be instantly open to genealogical and archaeological scrutiny), one of its most important contributions is the kind of 'attitude' that it brings to the critical task. It is not about breaking down or exposing the insidious effects of various power-knowledge constellations and the ontologies they engender, rather it is to bring a certain humility and deference to these assemblages, 236 whether they derive from a 'hegemonic' biomedicine or a 'subjugated' alternative medicine. Deference, because these assemblages of power-knowledge relations will always have their side effects. 237 References Ackerknecht, E.

Proper function-ing and performance of software and computer systems play a major role in obtaining consistency, reliability and accuracy of data. Therefore, computer system validation (CSV) should be part of any good development and manufacturing practice. It is also requested by EU and FDA regulations and guidelines through the overall requirement that \"equipment must be suit-able for its intended use\".Specific requirements for computers can be found in sec-tion 211.68 of the US cGMP regulations (USC, 2008). * Automatic, mechanical, or electronic equipment or other types of equipment, including computers, or related systems that will perform a function satis-factorily, may be used in the manufacture, process-ing, packing, and holding of a drug product. If such equipment is so used, it shall be routinely calibrat-ed, inspected, or checked according to a written pro-gram designed to assure proper performance. Writ-ten records of those calibration checks and inspec-tions shall be maintained. * Appropriate controls shall be exercised over comput-er or related systems to assure that changes in master production and control records or other records are instituted only by authorized personnel. * Input to and output from the computer or related system of formulas or other records or data shall be checked for accuracy. * The degree and frequency of input/output verifica-tion shall be based on the complexity and reliability of the computer or related system. * A backup file of data entered into the computer or re-lated system shall be maintained except where cer-tain data, such as calculations performed in connec-tion with laboratory analysis, are eliminated by com-puterization or other automated processes. In such instances a written record of the program shall be maintained along with appropriate validation data. * Hard copy or alternative systems, such as duplicates, tapes, or microfilm, shall be designed to assure that backup data are exact and complete and that it is se-cure from alteration, inadvertent erasures, or loss shall be maintained.Specific requirements for computers and electronic re-cords and signatures are also defined in FDA's regulations 21 CFR Part 11 on electronic Records and Signatures (USC, 1997).The Good Automated Manufacturing Practices Forum (GAMP) has developed guidelines for computer validation. All these guidelines and publications follow a couple of prin-ciples:* Validation of computer systems is not a onetime event. It starts with the definition of the product or project and setting user requirement specifications and cover the vendor selection process, installation, initial operation, going use, and change control and system retirement. * All publications refer to some kind of life cycle mod-el with a formal change control procedure being an important part of the whole process. * There are no detailed instructions on what should be tested. All guidelines refer to risk assessment for the extent of validation.Validation of computer systems is not a once off event. Annex 11 of the European GMP directive is very clear about this: Validation should be considered as part of the complete life cycle of a computer system. This cycle includes the stag-es of planning, specification, programming, testing, commis-sioning, documentation, operation, monitoring and modify-ing\" (EC, 2010).Scope The scope of this work is to present the validation of ERP SAP computer system used in Alkaloid AD Skopje known as AlkaSAP system.S2 PP 110238Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 237 - 238 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsBackgroundAlkaSAP system was implemented in Alkaloid AD Sko-pje in 2007. Within AlkaSAP there are several 'modules', each of which contains transactions in order to perform nec-essary tasks to complete business processes. Several of these tasks and processes are considered critical or have regulatory implications to Alkaloid. The SAP implemented modules in Alkaloid AD Skopje in 2007 were: 1. Sales & Distribution (SD)2. Production Planning (PP)3. Quality Management (QM)4. Materials Management (MM)5. Financial Accounting (FI)6. Controlling (CO)During 2014 additional SAP module concerning human capital management (HCM) was implemented. Validation of the AlkaSAPValidation of the AlkaSAP system was made in accor-dance with GAMP 4. All validation activities were defined in Validation Master Plan (VMP). The validation programme was divided into phases according to the validation life cy-cle. Each phase was divided into tasks and for every task there were actions, responsibilities and associated procedures. Specification / Design PhaseDuring this phase the following documents were created:Validation Master Plan (VMP); User Requirement Spec-ification (URS); Functional Specification (FS); Risk Assess-ment (RsA); Hardware Design Specification (HDS); Software Design Specification (SDS); Code Review (CR);Testing phaseBoth hardware and software elements were tested as part of the AlkaSAP implementation.Hardware Acceptance TestingHardware Acceptance Testing (including Infrastructure) was conducted successfully on all servers.Document reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP HATSSoftware Acceptance TestingAll bespoke and functional application software identi-fied in the Functional Specification or Software Design Speci-fication was tested against the Software Acceptance test Spec-ification.Document Reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP SATSSoftware Performance Test SpecificationAll software identified in the Functional Specification or Software Design Specification was given a risk priority and was tested against the Software Performance Test Specifica-tion:Document Reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP SPTSIn accordance with risk priority given in the Risk Assess-ment tests were executed as Detailed Functional Tests; User Acceptance Tests; Business ScenariosValidation ReportThe Validation Report has been issued as a phased report for the purpose of 'go-live' for the AlkaSAP and summarizes the validation programme activities.Document Reference: CSV VMR AlkaSAPOngoing Operation and EvaluationIn order to control and maintain the validation status of the AlkaSAP system, the following procedures are established and written:Policies and Procedures for Security and Access to serv-ersPolicies and Procedures for Back Up, Restore and Ar-chiveProcedures for Training and Operating of the systemPeriodic reviewPeriodic Reviews of the System is covered by Alkaloid Guideline ensuring SOPs, validation documentation and re-cords are audited on a regular basis to evaluate the effective-ness of controlling procedures.SummaryAlkaloid AD Skopje started 'go-live' with the validated AlkaSAP computer system.

There are 400 - 500 compounds that have been identified in its extracts, and among them approximately 70 are C21 terpenophenols, members of a group known as cannabinoids, specific for this plant (ElSohly and Slade, 2005; Fischedick, et al., 2009; Turn-er, et al., 1980). The constituent of Cannabis sativa L., D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9THC), is the primary psychoac-tive cannabinoid. Given that the main pharmacological and psychoactive effects have been attributed to this com-pound, the most of the studies have been focused on its ef-fects (Costa, 2007). The effects of Cannabis sativa L. are not solely due to 9THC because cannabidiol (CBD) was found to cause pharmacological effects (Russo and Guy, 2006). It was shown that CBD and other cannabinoids achieve synergy with 9THC causing potentiation of ben-efits, antagonism of adverse effects, summation, pharma-cokinetic advantages, and metabolism (Russo and Guy, 2006). Many countries became more liberal towards medici-nal use of Cannabis sativa L. (Baker et al., 2003). Recent-ly there has been an increasing interest in development of cannabinoids and Cannabis sativa L. preparations as legiti-mate medicines for a variety of medical applications. Some of them include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, glaucoma, asthma and cardiovascular condi-tions, and as an antiemetic (Williamson and Evans, 2000). Cannabidoids are very potent compounds and their control in Cannabis sativa L. preparations is very important, espe-cially because their potential users are patients which al-ready have serious health problems. The aim of this study was to apply our in-house HPLC/DAD method on the Cannabis sativa L. preparations pres-ent in the European market and to control their quality.Materials and methodsThe samples of Cannabis sativa L. preparations were purchased from the European market, produced by Endoca (Pharmaceutical Company, Denmark). The standard sub-stances were obtained from Lipomed AG (Switzerland). The samples of standard substances were: 9-THC (3-pen-tyl-6,6,9-trimethyl-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-dibenzo(b,d)pyran-1-ol), delivered as 1 mL ampule solution (5 mg/ mL prepared in ethanol, with purity 98.52%, m/m) and CBD ((-)-trans-2-p-mentha-1,8-dien-3-yl-5-pentylresorcinol) as the solid substance (99.73%, m/m). The solvents used dur-ing the analysis were with HPLC grade. For the chromatographic analysis Agilent Technolo-gies HPLC system 1200 series (Germany) was used. The analysis was performed on HPLC-column: Purospher(r) Star RP18e (150 mm x 4.6 mm ID, 5 um) from Merck KGaA (Germany) using mobile phase composed of ace-tonitrile and water in gradient mode with acetonitrile from 50%, V/V, to 80%, V/V, at flow rate 1.5 mL/min, tempera-ture 30 degC, detection at 220 nm, injection 10 uL, in 31 min run time. The working solutions of standard substance CBD were prepared in methanol in two concentration ranges: S2 PP 111240Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 239 - 240 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentations95.48 ug/mL - 286.43 ug/mL and 103.13 ug/mL - 309.40 ug/mL. The 9THC working solutions were prepared in methanol in concentration range: 9.81 ug/mL - 19.63 ug/mL. The sample solutions were prepared by liquid/liquid extraction technique using a mixture of methanol and chlo-roform (9:1). When the layers were clearly separated, the sample from the methanolic layer was applied in HPLC/DAD system. Results and discussionFive different Cannabis sativa L. preparations pur-chased from the European market were analyzed. All were prepared from hemp oil with various amounts of CBD as active compound and naturally contains 9-THC, as an im-purity. According to the certificates the amount of CBD was: 3%; 5%; 10 %; 15% and 30%, m/m, and expected im-purity as 9THC was limited at maximum of 0.20%, m/m.For preparation of the samples we used the recom-mended United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime meth-od (UNODC Manual, 2009). For identification and quan-tification of cannabinoids we used our in-house chromato-graphic gradient method which we have proposed for hemp seed oil analysis (Shishovska et al., 2014) because of the similarity of samples in origin and form. In the analyzed samples of hemp oil preparations can-nabidiol and 9THC were identified and quantified. Iden-tifications were done by comparing of the retention times and UV spectra of standard compounds with retention times of peaks at the chromatograms of samples and their UV spectra. The retention times of CBD and 9THC peaks were 15.9 min and 21.0 min, respectively.For the quantification, data obtained from the chro-matograms were calculated using the method of the cal-ibration curve (constructed as concentration, c (ug/ml), versus peak area, A (mAU)). The analyzed working solu-tions of the active compound CBD and the trace compound 9THC showed high linearity in the working ranges. The estimated coefficient of the linearity for CBD working so-lutions at concentration range: 95.48 ug/mL - 286.43 ug/mL was 1.000 (A = 23688 c + 16.188); while for the CBD working solutions at concentration range: 103.13 ug/mL - 309.40 ug/mL it was 0.9998 (A = 39613 c + 31.129), and for the working solutions of standard substance 9THC at concentration range: 9.81 ug/mL - 19.63 ug/mL it was 0.9997 (A = 25269 c - 7.0738).It was found that content of cannabidiol in analyzed samples is from 109.7% to 125.4%, m/m of the declared values. The assays of 9THC traces at the samples vary according the concentration of the active compound. As quantities of CBD at samples were lower (3 - 5%), the as-say of 9THC is under the allowed maximum limit (0.02% - 0.14%), but at samples with higher concentrations of CBD (10 - 30%) the 9THC traces are above the allowed maximum limit (0.45% - 1.14%).ConclusionThe satisfactory chromatographic data proved that our in-house gradient HPLC/DAD method can be successful-ly used for determination of the active substance CBD and traces of 9THC in Cannabis sativa L. preparations. The results obtained for the analyzed samples of Cannabis sati-va L. preparations showed higher amounts of CBD than de-clared value in the certificate (differences range from 9.7% m/m to 25.4%, m/m). In two samples, the amount of 9THC found was under allowed maximum limit of 0.20%, while in three samples the amount was above that value."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Cannabis sativa L.,', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['pharmacological', 'psychoactive', 'psychoac-tive']}, {'scientific_name': 'Cannabis sativa L.', 'medical_conditions': ['multiple sclerosis', 'chronic pain', 'glaucoma', 'asthma', 'cardiovascular condi-tions'], 'medicinal_effects': ['pharmacological', 'antiemetic']}, {'scientific_name': 'Cannabis sati-va L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

Co-creation plays an important role for novel products' development. Rrepresentatives of the food industry, chefs and restaurant owners, food researchers, nutritionists, conservationists and people involved with health and quality control of food products co-created a novel soup based on various vegetables and medicinal-aromatic plants (MAPs), enriched with aromatic oils, extra virgin olive oil, extractions of herbal teas and others (>30 traditional Greek food ingredients).To increase the product's functionality, encapsulated probiotics were added for stability throughout processing and storage time. High-pressure (HP) technology was used to cold-pasteurize the final product, preserving its functional-nutritional characteristics.The product formulation was based on the high nutritional value of the ingredients used and their superior organoleptic characteristics compared to conventional products readily available. Lactic acid bacteria were used for adding functionality to the final product. The bacteria were encapsulated in a solution of sodium alginate and pectin to maintain their viability after pasteurization. The final product-soup was pasteurized using thermal (75-90degC for 5-20min) or High-Pressure technology (HP at 400-600 MPa, 25degC, for 5-15min). The results showed that encapsulated bacteria could not survive from thermal treatment, while HP treatment maintained 30-80% of their viability, depending on the conditions used. For the finally treated product at 400MP-25degC-5min, a shelf-life test was performed at storage temperatures 0-15degC, measuring the dominant deterioration factors. The optimum shelf-life was estimated to 2 months after storage at 4degC, with 65% retention of bacteria viability (total bacteria population>106CFU/g) and >90% retention of ingredients' nutritional value.The results indicated that a superior functional vegetable- and MAP-based product can be produced using appropriate ingredients and novel technology for stabilization as an alternative to thermal treatment.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org124Aromatic and medicinal plants of the Mediterranean basin as food and dietary supplementsPosters20th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSAromatic and medicinal plants of the Mediterranean basin as food and dietary supplementsP021. Comparison of total phenolic content of Cretan wild edible herbs (horta).V. Klontza, E.-F. Varvouni, K. Graikou, I. ChinouDivision of Pharmacognosy and Chemistry of Natural Products, Dept. of Pharmacy, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece The Greek island of Crete is well known for its traditional cuisine, which is depending exclusively on the local agricultural products and is dating all the way back to the ancient times. Medical studies revealed that Cretan diet, milestone of the Mediterranean diet, contributes to the highest longevity and low mortality rate of the Cretans. High consumption of olive oil, vegetables, herbs, fruits, fish, wine are the main principles of this diet. Moreover, wild edible green herbs, which grow in all regions of Crete, are an integral part of the traditional gastronomy. They are mainly consumed boiled or stir fried but also raw in salads. Nowadays, there is a growing interest on these plants, mainly due to their high nutritional value and their potential therapeutic properties (Camara et al., 2016; Goncalves et al., 2018). In the present work, eight wildly grown edible green herbs, so called \"horta\", were collected from East Crete: aerial parts of Dioscorea communis (L.) Caddick & Wilkin, Echium italicum L., Erodium cicutarium (L.) L'Her, Glebionis segetum (L.)

Different extracts of all eight studied plants were evaluated for their total phenolic content (TPC) using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The aqueous and methanol extracts of Erodium cicutarium (201 mg GAE/g and 149 mg GAE/g) and Verbena officinalis (136 mg GAE/g, 140 mg GAE/g) showed the highest TPC among the tested samples, confirming their valuable nutritional importance in Crete, while their phenolic chemical profiles, are also in accordance to the expressed TPC as rich sources in flavonoids (flavonol and flavon derivatives) and phenolic acids (rosmarinic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric acids).

In our days, the plant has been widely used as a bioenergy crop. The shifting from conventional crops to artichoke cultivation has brought economical and environmental advantage according to the literature (Danalatos, 2008). In this particular study, the seeds of a certain established Greek cultivar of C. cardunculus hybrid, that has been cultivated in the experimental field and used as biofuel, have been investigated. The main purpose of our study was to evaluate the chemical profile, the total phenolic content and the nutritional value characterization of its seeds, not previously studied and till now just wasted as a bioproduct. The non-polar cyclohexanic extract was saponificated, esterificated and subjected to GC/MS analyses, where to our results appeared as a rich source in o-6 and other fatty acids (linoleic, palmitic, oleic and arachidonic acid). Several secondary metabolites have been further isolated and structurally elucidated by NMR from the methanol extract (arctiin, cynarinine, tracheloside, caffeoyl derivatives) and the dichloromethane one (arctigenin, trachylogenin, fatty acids and aryl ester derivatives). Moreover, the methanolic extract displayed the highest content of total phenolic content (142.83 mg GAE/g) followed by aqueous (88.87 mg GAE/g) and dichloromethane extract (64.32 mg GAE/g). Furthermore, the raw seeds have been shown remarkably high nutritional value (fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants etc) compared to the famous for their nutritional value sesame- and flax-seeds.

The adventurous trip of Origanum vulgare smells along a transect from its southernmost (Crete) to the northernmost (Norway) native range in Europe.D. Mertzanidis1,3, A. Assimopoulou2,3, S. Kokkini1,31 Laboratory of Systematic Botany and Phytogeography, School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece2 Organic Chemistry Laboratory, School of Chemical Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece3 CIRI- AUTH Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Innovation - Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GreeceOriganum vulgare L. is found as a native plant almost all over Europe. It is a very popular herb widely used in food flavoring, tea infusions, and dietary supplements. It is also used as an ornament in house gardens. Several therapeutic properties are attributed to the plants of that species, mainly related to the variety of their organoleptically distinct smells [1]. Through a review of scientific publications [2][3] of the last 26 years, we attempt to find out the O. vulgare \"smell identity\" along a transect of Europe, from the southernmost (island of Crete) to the northernmost part of its native range (Norway). Published information on essential oils (EO) responsible for the plant smells, were recorded in respect to their total content (intensity of smell) and their main constituents (type of smell). Plants of O. vulgare are highly variable in respect to their EO content, with the lowest value recorded in Bulgaria (Rhodopi Mountains, 0,03 mL 100g-1 dry weight) and the highest on the island of Crete, Greece (8,8%). The different types of plant smells are related to the dominant compounds of their total EO composition and can be described under the following four groups: (i) Plants with an oregano smell (EOs rich in carvacrol, up to 93,8% in Greece), (ii) thyme smell (rich in thymol up to 90,2%, in Greece), (iii) lavender smell (rich in linalool up to 57,9% in Austria), and (iv) marjoram smell (characterized by sabinene and isomers of sabinene hydrate, up to 28,7% in Norway). The results so far indicate that along their adventurous trip of approx. 3200Km, the native plants of the species O. vulgare give arise to four commercially valuable chemical \"species\" distinct by their smell profile.

Herbal teas in Thessaloniki: From the old tradition to the modern lifestyle.T. Pallia1, M. Keki2, D. Mertzanidis2,3, S. Kokkini2,31 Postgraduate Studies Program \"Conservation of Biodiversity and Sustainable Exploitation of Native Plants\", School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece2 Laboratory of Systematic Botany and Phytogeography, School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece3 CIRI- AUTH Center for Interdisciplinary Research and Innovation - Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GreeceThe use of herbs in Greece has its roots in ancient times [1]. Herbal teas, particularly infusions, with both medicinal and nutritional value have a long history of traditional use among cultures and regions of Greece. Until today, several aromatic and medicinal plants are consumed because of their flavor and a long-time traditional knowledge for their therapeutic activities [2][3]. In the frame of a wider project about the most common herbs and spices used in Thessaloniki (North Greece), the plant species used for the preparation of herbal teas have been explored. Thessaloniki is a multi-cultural city populated, besides Greeks, by several ethnic communities throughout its history, with a long tradition in the herbal trade [1]. In this study, three central open markets were visited and citizens from different ages and origins were interviewed about their customs and preferences in flavors of teas, using a questionnaire. The results so far indicate that a high number of taxa is used for herbal teas and infusions, plain or mixed, most of them native in Greece and Mediterranean area. The best represented families are Asteraceae (chiefly represented by the genus Matricaria), Lamiaceae (mainly taxa of the genera Mentha, Origanum, Thymus and Sideritis), and Tiliaceae (species of the genus Tilia). According to citizens, the majority of the herbs are collected from the wild of the surroundings of the city areas. Besides there is a remarkable number of plant taxa are imported from the Old and New World countries. Finally, it appears that the preference of citizens is largely based on their traditional knowledge and they choose their herbal tea according to their origin, while their age is a decisive factor to whether the herbs are collected from the wild or purchased from herbal markets.

Thereare about 25-30 species and subspecies in cultivation.The banana of commerce is Musa x paradisiaca. About300 cultivars are now planted.THE BANANA AND ITS ALLIESMusa acuminata Cavendish, dwarf, ChineseMusa balbisianaMusa corniculata horse bananaMusa discolorMusa erransMusa nana dwarf bananaMusa oleracea banana poreteMusa x paradisiaca banana, plantain, platanoMusa superba wild plantainMusa troglodytarum fe'iMusa textilis Manila hempEnsete ventricosum Abyssinian bananaA banana \"tree\" is actually a large, tree-like herb. Itcan reach a height of 25 ft. The trunk of a bananaplant is a series of overlapping leaf bases, hiding asmall central shoot that will later give rise to theflower cluster. The bulk of the stem system is a large,fleshy rhizome that lies underground. The leaves maybe 10-12 ft long. They are simple, but often appearpinnately compound because of the fraying of theblade that results from wind damage. The flowercluster is large and drooping, with the growing tip atthe bottom end of the inverted cluster. The femaleflowers, which will eventually produce the fruits, areborne toward the base of the cluster. The male flowersare toward the tip. These unisexual flowers, althoughconspicuous and attractive, are sterile. A plant willbegin to bear fruit in about 8-14 months. A maturefruiting cluster can weigh up to 140 lbs. Individualbananas occur in small bunches, known in theindustry as \"hands. \"By the way, if banana flowers are sterile, where didthose fruits come from? Review the brief discussion ofparthenocarpy in the introductory section.Bananas are harvested while green. They are soperishable that if they were picked after maturing,they would spoil before reaching the markets. After aplant has borne fruit, it usually dies back or is cutdown. Bananas are loaded on air-conditioned ships fortransport to world markets. The hold is usually kept atabout 14E C to prevent premature ripening. Thetemperature will later be raised to begin thematuration process. At that stage, the bananas turnfrom green to yellow and starch begins to change tosugar.Many different cultivars are now available, but we seeonly a few of them in our temperate markets. Ourlocal stores are carrying more than they once did.Until a few years ago, the most common cultivar was\"Gros Michel\" or \"Big Mike.\" It was wiped out by thedreaded Panama disease. Big Mike has been replacedby \"Valery\" and \"Lacatan. \"Modern bananas and their relatives contain fivegenomes (A, B, E, F, and T). All edible bananas-90-contain either the A (Acuminata) or B (Balbisiana)chromosome sets (AAA, AAB, ABB, BBB). The industryis based upon an AAA triploid [2n = 3x = 33]. Bananafruits are seedless, and therefore sterile, because ofthe genetic complications that arise from having threeidentical sets (AAA) of chromosomes competing withone another as they go through meiosis. Bananas arepropagated vegetatively by cuttings taken from themother plant.A close relative of the banana is the plantain, alsoknown as the platano or cooking banana. It is verywidely used in tropical countries as a food plant, butwas rarely seen in our markets until recent years. Theplantain must be cooked before use because it storescarbohydrates in the form of starch, rather thansugar. The cooking process converts starch to sugar.The only other economically important species is Musatextilis, the Manila hemp. It is not grown for its ediblefruits, but for its fibers. They are used in heavy ropesand in very delicate tea bags.A less known relative is Ensete ventricosum, theensete or Abyssinian banana. It is grown in Africa forfiber and for food - not from nice fleshy fruits. Theedible portions are the young shoots, leaf bases,flowers, and seeds.CITRUS FRUITSThe various citrus fruits, excluding the grapefruit andnumerous hybrids, all appear to be native toSoutheast Asia. The plants are shrubs or small treeswith compound leaves reduced to a single leaflet. Theplants have a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi inthe soil. Citrus plants are said to lack root hairs andthis relationship is probably explained on this basis. Allof the species are diploids [2n = 2x = 18].Most citrus production is in the New World, in bothtemperate and tropical areas. More oranges are grownthan any other citrus fruit. Annual production is about56 million metric tons; Brazil is the leading producer.Next comes the tangerine, at about 10 million metrictons, mostly from Japan. About 13 million metric tonsof lemons, limes, grapefruits, and pomelos areproduced each year. The United States is the leadingproducer.Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C, just as you havealways been told. The rind contains numerous oilglands, the basis of a famous parlor trick that I will tellyou about in lecture. The part of the fruit that we eatis a series of thick, juicy hairs that line the paperyseptations within the fruit. Look very closely nexttime!Some citrus fruits, such as the orange and thegrapefruit, are allowed to ripen on the tree. Others,such a lemons and limes, are harvested green. Manyoranges are artificially colored or treated with gases orother chemicals to destroy the green chlorophylls inthe flesh of the fruit to give it a better appearance onthe market shelf.The more familiar citrus fruits are the orange, lemon,lime, mandarin orange, tangerine, kumquat, citron,pomelo, shaddock, and sour orange. The grapefruitappears to be a spontaneous, recent hybrid betweenthe orange and the pomelo. All of them are variousspecies of Citrus, except for the kumquat. It belongsto the genus Fortunella.SUMMARY OF THE GENUS CITRUSSubgenus: Scientific/Common Name.

C (ascorbic acid) from fresh vegetablesand fruits. Tens of thousands of sailors died fromscurvy, especially from the 15th to the 18th centuries.One of the earliest scientific investigations was that ofDr. James Lind, who published \"A Treatise on Scurvy\"in 1753. He concluded that various citrus fruits werevery effective in the prevention and treatment ofscurvy. It would take almost a century for the Lords ofthe Admiralty to approve the use of lime juice onBritish naval vessels. Now you know why Britishsailors are called limeys.Here are typical symptoms of the disease:' Longing for land, greenery, home' Uncontrollable weeping' Depression' Weakening of capillaries' Subcutaneous bleeding' Anemia' Skin \"black as ink\"' Ulcers on legs' Loose teeth' Gums protruding from mouth' Really bad breath!' Stiffness/soreness of joints' Slow healing of wounds' Difficult breathing' Overwhelmed by stimuli' Death-91-COCONUT\"He who plants a coconut tree, plants food and drink,vessels and clothing, a habitation for himself, and aheritage for his children. \"(Polynesian traditional saying)' ' ' ' 'As inhabitants of the temperate zone, it is all butimpossible for us to appreciate Cocos nucifera, whichhas been called \"one of Nature's greatest gifts toMan,\" the \"tree of life,\" the \"tree of heaven,\" and\"Mankind's greatest provider in the tropics.\" There itprovides food, drink, oil, medicine, fiber, timber,thatch, mats, fuel, and domestic utensils. In additionto these utilitarian aspects, the coconut has alsoplayed a prominent role in the customs and beliefs oftropical peoples.The home of the coconut remains controversial. Itappears to have been present in both the Old Worldand the Americas before 1492. The fruit is able tofloat for a hundred days or more in salt water; thebest ocean currents are from Asia to the New World.It was probably first domesticated in the Indo-Pacificregion. There are no reproductive or geneticdifficulties here. 2n = 2x = 32.The coconut is a kind of palm. The trees can produce50-100, to as many as 500 fruits per year. The firstcrop typically comes on in about 6-8 years. The fruitis single-seeded. The fruit wall is clearly differentiatedinto an outer layer (exocarp) that is woody; a middlelayer (mesocarp) that is fibrous; and an inner, bonylayer (endocarp) that is more or less fused to the seedcoat. When we see coconuts in our markets, theexocarp and mesocarp have been removed duringprocessing. The coconut \"seed\" is the true seed, plusthe innermost layer of the fruit wall, the endocarp.After harvesting, the fruits are cut in half and thecoconut meat is gouged out. It will be cured in the sunor in kilns to yield copra. It contains about 60-68%oil. Coconut oil is about 90% saturated and it is one ofthe \"tropical oils\" that manufacturers are increasinglyproud to say they are no longer using in their foods.Once the oil has been removed from copra, theresidue (coconut cake) is used for cattle feed. It is arich source of protein and carbohydrates. Curiously, itis rarely eaten by humans, even in areas whereprotein is otherwise deficient.The middle portion of the fruit wall, the fibrousportion, is the source of coir. This fiber, sometimessold under the name coco fiber, is used for mats,rugs, filters, stuffing, and rope. Various plant partsyield sennit fiber used to make ropes, hats, andother items.DATE PALM\"Honor your maternal aunt, the palm, for it wascreated from the clay left over after the creation ofAdam (on whom be peace and the blessings of God!\" (The Prophet Muhammad)' ' ' ' 'We have been cultivating Phoenix dactylifera for 6000-8000 years. According to Muslim tradition, the firstdate palms arose from the dust left over from thecreation of Adam. This explains one of the plantscommon names, the \"tree of life.\" Wild populationswith small, inedible fruits may still be found in SaudiArabia and the Sahara. Today the domesticated formsare found on the fringes of African and Asian deserts.The date palm was introduced into California in 1765at Mission San Ignacio. This state and Arizona areleading producers in the U. S. The palm trees on theArcata plaza are Ph. canariensis, a relative of the datepalm native to the Canary Islands.The leaves of the date palm are used for thatchingand matting, and its trunks for building materials. Thefruit is a drupe, with a brown skin (exocarp), a sweetjuicy pulp (mesocarp), and a thin, bony layer(endocarp) surrounding a single seed. The fruits havea high sugar content. They may be consumed fresh,dried, or pounded into a paste. In the Arab world,they are often eaten with milk. If properly dried, theywill last indefinitely. A single tree can produce about100 lbs. of dates each year. Trees may continue tobear fruit for 100-200 years. Maturing fruits are oftenbagged to protect them from birds and insects. Weharvest dates the same way that we did in ancienttimes -- by hand, with a sharp knife.The Hebrews and Babylonians carried out a ritualceremony to ensure that a good crop of dates wouldbe produced. Even though the concept of sexuality inplants would not be discovered until the close of the17th century, they had found that it was necessary tobring pollen-bearing flowers into the oases where thedate palms grew. The cultivated date palm is a femaleplant and it must be fertilized with pollen from a maledate palm tree if it is to produce fruit. For thousandsof years, we have maintained a few, isolated maletrees wherever we cultivate the date palm for thispurpose. Although its seeds are fertile, we usually cutoff sucker shoots at the base of the trunk to grow newdate palms.We also discovered that we could ferment the sap ofthe date palm and produce arrak, which one sixteenthcentury traveler called \"the strongest and mostdreadful drink ever invented. \"PINEAPPLEAnanas comosus, native to the New World, wasunknown to Europeans until it was first seen byColumbus in 1493 on Guadaloupe Island. By thattime, the inhabitants of tropical America had alreadyselected seedless varieties for their use. Their wildcounterparts with numerous seeds could still be seengrowing in the vicinity of villages. When the pineapplewas introduced to Europe, it was considered aninteresting oddity, but certainly not an edible fruit.Leading growers include Costa Rica, the United States(principally in Hawaii), Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, andSouth Africa.The pineapple plant is an herb with a basal clump ofstiff, sword-shaped leaves. Many of the cultivars havesharp teeth on the leaf margins. The widely usedCayenne cultivar does not. The flowers are borne atthe center of the rosette of leaves. At first, the flowersare separate from one another, but as the plant setsfruit, the individual fruits from adjacent flowers fusewith one another to form a false fruit, the familiarpineapple. The hole in the center of canned pineapplerepresents the area once occupied by the central axisof the fruiting cluster. A plant can bear fruit in aboutone year. After the first pineapple has been cut fromthe plant, the growing point divides and the next cropwill be two, smaller pineapples per plant. After these-92-are harvested, the growing point divides once again,and four even smaller pineapples are produced. Theseare often used to make pineapple juice. After the 4-pineapple stage, replanting occurs. Except forhandpicking, the pineapple industry is now almostcompletely automated.Modern cultivars are also seedless. Unlike the banana,however, there are no genetic difficulties that preventsexual reproduction from occurring. We see to that byexcluding the pollinators needed for cross-polination.The fruits contain about 15% sugar, some organicacids, minerals, and a proteolytic enzyme calledbromelain. Because it can digest animal tissue,workers in the pineapple fields and processing plantsmust wear protective clothing. Test the power ofbromelain yourself by allowing the juice of areasonably fresh pineapple to remain on your lips.Note the tingling sensation as the enzyme begins todissolve the delicate tissue of your buccal orifice!FIGThe ancestral home of Ficus carica is probablysouthern Arabia. It spread quickly to theMediterranean. There are now several kinds of figs incultivation, notably the common fig, the Capri fig, andthe Smyrna fig.

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The creation of an identity and a group of like-minded contacts built around the material 'things' (the products) draws on an assemblage of entrepreneurialism, social capital (Lin, 2007), brand commitment and loyalty (Hur et al., 2011), while also being inspired by the idea of helping (or saving) others whose health is affected. The implicit promise is not only of health and happiness, but also prosperity for those who are prepared to place their trust in the company and its products. Pratt (2000: 456) interprets this strategy as a necessary one to 'win the hearts and minds' of those who work for a network marketing organisation in the absence of regular hours, work colleagues, a physical location, and the psychological contract of job security provided in the traditional workplace. 137 Part of the identity creation appears to be the implicit invitation to the distributor to model themselves on the inspirational life story of the company founder which, as Cardwell (1998:17) describes, commonly follows a nearly identical trajectory in all companies: ...the guru as head of the company [who] ...was told by conventional medicine that he ... had only six weeks/months/hours to live. Fortunately they found one or more 'natural' plant based products that cured their cancer ... and now they have a fundamental and evangelistic desire to sell their amazing product to the world. This was indeed closely paralleled by four stories that were related to me by different participants about four different brands of products. Each time it was presented as a type of hero's journey (Campbell, 1973); the quest of the company founder to overcome a health threat to themselves or a close family member; the breakthrough discovery after a period of isolation or intense study; the struggle to overcome others' disbelief; and their subsequent dedication to sharing their discovery for the betterment of the world and making a fortune in the process. Here is just one of them: The history behind it was a guy from South Korea [who] was a billionaire. He was an industrialist and the story is that he got stomach cancer. So he went and lived up in the mountains somewhere and started eating an aloe plant, and basically lived off an aloe vera plant for quite a long time and then went back down and got tested and his stomach cancer was gone. So he took all his money and basically sold all his assets from his steel and invested it in this technology for aloe vera plants and then built these big farms and then started a system where you buy in, you sell it to your friends and you get a profit. .... they would give this big seminar to everyone and tell them how this special herbal - medicine I guess - has changed their life. Everything from people's stomach cramps to all these different types of healing, almost like miracles that they've experienced with this. (Duncan) These narratives with their tales of the quest, seclusion from the world, and return with \"the goods of salvation\" (Rey, 2004: 331), had unmistakable overtones that resonated with the myths, legends, and religious figures that were described in the background chapter. Albertson (2011: 127) draws attention to the implicit appeal of religious language in societies where \"...religion has old roots in the lives of many ... people carry emotional and cognitive residue from their pasts that are at work in their current political attitudes and choices.\" Even for those without these religious echoes from their past, the narratives in fairy tales abound with the 138 same elements of quest and salvation. These generic tales or \"ur-narratives ...contain the seeds of many genres\" (Berger 2016: 71); in them the heroes are often aided by magic objects or 'things' through which they manage to find the inner strength to prevail over difficulties. The universal appeal of the hero(ine) winning the battle against the odds would seem to be not only deeply rooted in the ancient myths of humanity's distant past but to be always evolving, rearranging itself to any context without losing its intrinsic qualities. Rey (2004: 333) has drawn attention to the way these ur-narratives are echoed in economic success stories of this sort, when the company founder, the 'charismatic prophet' produces symbolic goods for benefit of the people. Even in network marketing the reworking of these themes with their origins in the distant past demonstrates that \"mythology shows itself to be as amenable as life itself to the obsessions and requirements of the individual, the race, the age\" (Campbell 1973: 330). All the companies named by study participants were based in the United States, where there is a lengthy history of network marketing companies being investigated by the US Food and Drug Administration for deceptive marketing practices or conducting illegal pyramid selling schemes focused around the material products (Anonymous, 2003; Berg, 1994; Herbig & Yelkurm, 1997). One controversial area has been the evangelistic nature of network company distributors in their efforts to recruit others. The fascination and fear associated with such companies has led to them being described as cults (Bhattacharya & Mehta, 2000; Krzywirzeka, 2013) who use \"mind control\" (Pratt, 2000: 456) to exert overly strong attachments among their adherents. Certainly those participants who were currently distributors for network marketing companies at the time I spoke to them were fulsome and evangelistic in the way they spoke about the products (the 'things'). They demonstrated high levels of commitment, enthusiasm, and a sense of making a worthwhile contribution by making the company products available to people who needed help. While they at no time appeared to be in the grip of a cult, I gained the impression that too much confidence in the company's products could lead to potentially overblown claims about what their 'things' could achieve. One network marketer gave an account of stepping in to help an acquaintance who was awaiting an amputation in hospital because of diabetic complications: So it is a very simple programme getting rid of diabetes and our shake just puts your blood sugar right straight away. ... Well! The next day he is sitting up in bed and he is coming to life already. Each day they said, Oh, he's getting stronger by the day. Well, when they got him back [to hospital], his blood sugar was exactly right ... Everything was coming right after four days and then the surgeon looked at his leg and said, \"I must have made a mistake. He doesn't need his leg off!\" (Clara) 139 Clara here represents the 'shake' that she gave to her acquaintance as being the 'goods of salvation' mentioned above, that saved his leg. Molly, however, was much more reserved about what she claimed to do herself, noting that she would never give more than generic advice but would always refer to other sources in her company: There's certain things you can and can't do. So if you are not a qualified nutritionist you can't give nutrition advice. .... You've just got to be really careful and that's fair enough because if you are not qualified I don't feel you should do it anyway. (Molly) Another major criticism of network marketing has highlighted the high rates of turnover among disillusioned distributors, with some said to be filled with hatred for the companies they formerly belonged to (Pratt, 2000; Mswelli and Sargeant, 2001). There were a few study participants who were ex-network marketers, but they were neutral about the companies they had been involved with. It seemed that they had mostly been drawn in to oblige a friend or relative but and had never fully 'bought in' emotionally to the assemblage of discourses that hinged on the 'thing power' of the products that the companies sold. Moreover, the expense of the products deterred younger people who were not yet well established financially and they found the commitment more than they could maintain on their limited budget: I think it was about $60 ... I remember I got a discount I think of 20%. That was still a lot for me anyway. I think they would expect you to get a new one [pack] every one or two months. I can't really afford that. (Iris) Duncan also had a history of being both a user and distributor and although he had extricated himself from the company without great difficulty, he admitted that the entanglement of personal and business relationships had made it awkward. He too had found it an expensive exercise: It's a community; you make friends, you get involved and it almost turns into a community group. You know, you go to meetings together and you make friends... And then they would say, well you know, you purchase this. The thing was that a bottle like this [indicating size] was about $90 so it would last you a month. (Duncan) Network marketing proved to be an interesting way of examining the assemblage of actants around supplements from a different angle. It encompassed the same levers of supply and demand, and the same discourses of naturalness and risk. However, it differed in that it drew directly on personal commitment to a particular company and appealed more intensely to 140 emotional engagement with 'things' which not only had value as supplements but also symbolised the underlying narrative of altruism and salvation more overtly entangled with the economic values of entrepreneurialism and personal profit (Berger, 2016: 71), in a way that was absent from those participants who sold products in health stores and pharmacies. Conclusion In concluding this chapter, it is useful to return to Bennett's words quoted at the beginning of the chapter, framing non-human matter as: ...an actant inside and alongside intention-forming, morality-(dis)obeying, language using, reflexivity wielding and culture making human beings and as an inducer-producer of salient, public effects (Bennett, 2010: 39). Assemblages of ingested matter, whether supplements, pharmaceuticals or ordinary foods, whether helpful or harmful, have been analysed from countless medical, public health, commercial, and sociological perspectives but human behaviour has almost always been at the centre of these analyses (Flegal et al., 2012; Gotay et al., 2013; Mayes, 2015; Mitchell, 2001; Wang & Lim, 2012). Here, in contrast, non-human things have been brought into the foreground as vital matter that acted as an important catalyst in the participants' lives. What may have begun as a minor or random decision to take a supplement 'thing' appeared to have had the power to generate physical, mental and spiritual effects in their lives and given them hope for the future, even if their basic conditions were still troublesome. They had developed a personal story around their supplement use that resulted from a maze of connections in which the material products - the things - had a central role in making their story what it was. The meaning was what mattered; the precise mechanism by which the 'thing' mattered, appeared to be irrelevant. Humans organize their experiences into temporarily meaningful episodes. Narrative is both a mode of reasoning and a mode of representation. People can \"apprehend\" the world narratively and people can \"tell\" about the world narratively. ... Explanation in the narrative mode is contextually embedded, whereas the logico-scientific explanation is extracted from spatial and temporal events. Both modes are rational ways of making meaning (Richardson, 1990: 118). Moreover, the meaning they drew from their products was not static but always in process, constantly forming and reforming as it evolved and changed. The participants were part of this 141 dynamic evolution, contributing to its onward movement through the effects of their actions to research, purchase and consume supplements to look after their health. These activities were also changing the participants themselves as they gained experience and expertise as 'supplement users'. The effect of their interaction with the 'thing power' of the supplements appeared to have given them a sense of control over their health care options and to be an important influence in their decision making not only for themselves but in their interactions with orthodox health care options. The next chapter moves on to tackle the issue of power and expertise over health and to look at the part supplements played in identity building for participants in their ongoing life journey. 142 Chapter 6: Supplements: through responsibility and expertise to power Introduction The previous chapter ended by looking forward to the sense of control that the participants experienced through making independent decisions around supplements and health. This chapter examines the assemblage of ideas that had come together to build that sense of control. Primarily, these focused around two prominent themes that were raised by the participants: being responsible about their health, and developing expertise in doing so. The participants clearly saw themselves as responsible people who were taking every care to look after their health, yet they were quite well aware that supplement use was not endorsed as a responsible practice by health experts. They did not see this as a conflict, however, but viewed their supplements as something extra that they could do over and above following the recommended precepts about living a healthy life. Moreover, they explained, they were becoming their own experts about supplements and their uses, searching out information from a wide range of sources and putting their new knowledge into practice as they learned more about them. For those participants who also sold supplements, this included building expertise in how to advise others in their use. To examine these issues relating to the tension between authorised advice and independent decisions that deviate from it, this chapter draws from Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality as they are manifested in the modern neoliberal state. As Foucault described it, biopower is the guiding and shaping of citizens to be \"eminently governable\" neoliberal subjects (Lorenzini, 2018: 155). Biopower operates through what Foucault termed the 'conduct of conduct' (Burchell et al., 1991; Foucault, 1988; Lemke, 2002), that is, the provision of guidance by officially authorised experts so that people internalise the approved way to behave and do so freely, but in a way which also serves the interests of the state (Danaher et al., 2000; Petersen & Lupton, 1996). In the sphere of health, governmentality works by encouraging people to take responsibility for looking after themselves according to the advice of medical professionals and public health experts who are credentialed and sanctioned by the state. They are seen as the repository of expert knowledge which is deployed in \"shaping the thoughts and actions of subjects in order to make them more useful and 'governable'\"(Petersen & Lupton, 1996: 14). Choosing to follow the advice and make 'correct' choices, they reduce their likelihood of becoming unwell and therefore creating a burden for themselves and for the state to look 143 after. Responsible citizens who have internalised this advice and willingly submit to this 'conduct of conduct', have the greatest likelihood of being considered well-ordered and healthy, thereby contributing to the productivity of the state as a whole. While individuals are not forced to conform to these norms, they are encouraged to see them as being in their own interests. Nevertheless, many people do resist being 'conducted' according to recommended advice. They may continue to smoke, drink too much alcohol or keep on with 'unhealthy eating' that makes them overweight, even though they know quite well that these are not considered responsible health practices. Yet all these behaviours are quite legal and the products that enable them are easily available, often heavily advertised with special offers and discounting that make them even more attractive. Viewed from an economic perspective, the buying and selling of such things is generally seen as uncontroversial, for they fit with the modern neoliberal state's focus on ensuring that the freedom of the market is maintained, that consumers keep spending, and that the economy continues to grow. The interests of the market, therefore, frequently run directly counter to expert advice on health and take precedence over policies which would be likely to constrain commercial activity and inhibit growth. Instead, the onus is placed on individuals to be 'responsible' and refrain from indulging in behaviours which are not approved (Herrick, 2011). Clearly, supplements are in a different category from these overtly harmful products, but they too are frowned on by health experts, albeit for different reasons. There are continuing calls for more restrictions on their availability or to bring them under the control of health professionals. Yet the importance of the commercial activity these products generate (Grand View Research, 2019) appears to outweigh the voices of health experts when it comes to policy making and regulations. By resisting authorised health advice and instead turning to the market for their products, however, it may be that individuals who wish to use or sell supplements are merely exchanging one form of being conducted for another, that is, the subtle and less overtly stated form of control that commercial interests exercise over people who buy their products (Kasabov, 2004). Foucault's concept of governmentality has been taken up and applied to this viewpoint as well, showing that the ever increasing use of digital surveillance is continually and relentlessly gathering and analysing the personal details and habits of those who buy, whether they shop online or in person (Ganesh, 2016). This digital surveillance has been likened to an \"electronic super-Panopticon\" (Zwick & Knott, 2009: 227) that constructs consumers as passive commodities to be manipulated by personalised advertising (Couldry & Turow, 2014). They are seen as being induced to spend money on products that merely enrich commercial companies 144 and their shareholders and that do nothing to benefit the people that buy them (Boyd & Crawford, 2012; Brayne, 2017; Ganesh, 2016). This construction, however, would seem to underestimate the power of ordinary citizens. The tensions between the two competing forces - that is, the conduct of citizens by expert health advice and the machinations of the market to control them - create areas of \"fragility and blindspots\" where the modern neoliberal state is at cross purposes with itself (Lorenzini, 2018: 157). Individuals such as the participants may engage in what Foucault termed \"strategic games between liberties\" (Foucault 1988 cited in Lemke 2002: 53), that is, they may use their freedom creatively to exploit those tensions and resist being 'conducted' quite so much (Lorenzini, 2018). In effect, this response by individuals is another example of the far reaching interconnections that are possible in the rhizomatic network of actants that are interconnected in a moving assemblage around a particular issue. By exploring and experimenting with ways to benefit from all the options that are available from both orthodox health advice and the commercial market, and resisting and avoiding those aspects they dislike, they may develop expertise in using both to maximum advantage for themselves, thereby gaining a sense of control and independence from both. This chapter has three sections that discuss these issues in the light of the participants' reports. The first focuses on the participants' construction of themselves as responsible and morally 'good' people who took great care to look after their health."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'aloe vera', 'medical_conditions': ['stomach cancer', 'stomach cramps'], 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

PURPOSEFUL USE OFTOXIC PLANTS\"We did not escape without damage because [theIndians] killed another companion of ours ... and intruth, the arrow did not penetrate half a finger, but asit had poison on it, he gave up his soul to our Lord. \"(Francisco de Orellana, 1541)We have knowingly used poisonous plants asinstruments of punishment, torture, murder, andsuicide. As interesting as some of these episodesmight be, they are not the subject of this section. Iwant to concentrate instead on our use of plant toxinsin arrow poisons, in the little-known ritual known asthe \"ordeal,\" and on their use to kill fish, insects, androdents.ARROW & DART POISONSPeoples of both the Old World and the New Worldhave used many different plants in the preparation ofthese poisons. Native Americans on this continentused relatively few arrow poisons from plant sources,relying instead on rattlesnake venom and the juices ofthe black widow spider. The Indians of South Americaand the tribesmen of Africa used arrow poisons bothto hunt wild game and in wars against their enemies.CURARE. This is probably the most famous arrowpoison. The name is a phonetic rendering of an Indianphrase meaning, \"He, to whom it comes, falls.\" Otherspellings used in the literature are urari, woorari,woorali, and wourali. Curare is the name for a wholegroup of arrow poisons used in South America. Thefact that the ingredients and their relative proportionsvary from one location to the next hindered any realunderstanding of the botanical and chemical nature ofthe poison.The Baron Alexander von Humboldt was probably thefirst European to witness the preparation of curare. Hewrote that the Indians shredded bark of certain treesand made an infusion from it. This was furtherconcentrated by boiling it. Several other plantmaterials were added to the mixture.The Indians have several different ways of assayingthe strength of curare. One is to wound a frog with apoisoned arrow or dart. If it can jump more than eighttimes without the curare taking effect, then the potionis deemed too weak. Another test involves a monkeyjumping from tree to tree. When the curare is at itsproper strength, an animal should not be able to jumpto more than one tree before the toxin takes effect.And, a final test is that since the honor of preparingcurare often falls to the old women of the tribe, if theyare not half intoxicated by the fumes of the boilingmixture, the brew is not yet ready.The exact botanical nature of curare is still in somedoubt. The two principal toxic ingredients areStrychnos spp. (often S. toxifera) of the Logan-iaceaeand Chondrodendron tomentosum of the moonseedfamily (Menispermaceae).Three basic groups or kinds of curare are oftenrecognized, based upon the physical form in whichthey are prepared. Tubocurare, also known as tubecurare or bamboo curare, is cylindrical, having beenpacked in hollow bamboo stems. The two other kindsare gourd or calabash curare and pot curare.Chondrodendron is the principal ingredient in tubecurare; it is also used in pot curare. Strychnos is usedin both calabash and pot curare.The active ingredient is d-tubocurarine chloride ortubocurarine chloride, a whitish, odorless powder.Poisoning manifests itself in muscular relaxation byblocking of impulses between the nerve and themuscle fiber activated by it. Symptoms include:' impaired vision' bilateral drooping of lips' heaviness of face' relaxation of jaw' weakness of head muscles' inability to raise head' paralysis of spinal muscles, legs, & arms' slowed respiration, and' death.Curare is rapidly destroyed and excreted. Its actionusually lasts for about 15-20 minutes, during whichthe victim dies. The flesh of animals killed by curaremay be eaten.There are also medicinal uses for curare. Because it isa muscle relaxant, it may be used in the treatment ofconvulsive mental patients and in certain types ofsurgery. Curare is also used to diagnose myastheniagravis, a muscular disorder characterized by an overalldeterioration of muscle tone.KOMBI. The action of this African arrow poison wasfirst described in detail by Dr. David Livingstone, themissionary to Africa of \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume\"fame. He observed people preparing a poison from thefruits of Strophanthus, a member of Apocynaceae, thedogbane family. The action of kombi is much like thatof curare. The wounded animal rarely runs more thanabout a hundred yards before it falls. Kombi containsstrophanthin, a glycoside with digitalis-like effects. Itmust get into the blood stream, which means that theflesh of kombi victims is edible.Strophanthin also finds limited uses in medicine. It isused on heart attack victims when time is of theutmost importance. It takes effect much faster thandigitalis, but it is such a violent poison that thedosages must be carefully controlled.UPAS. This is an arrow poison used by the natives ofJava. The chief ingredient is Antiaris toxicaria ofMoraceae, the mulberry family.OUABAIN. The natives of tropical Africa prepare anarrow poison from Strophanthus gratus. A somewhatinferior brand can be made from Acokantheraschimperi and A. deflexa.

The technique is notcomplex. It typically involves putting the required partof a particular plant in a still body of water. The planttoxin is released into the water, numbing the fish sothat it comes floating to the surface.The California buckeye (Aesculus californica) was usedby several tribes of Native Americans. Seeds,sometimes leaves or young stems, were crushed andmade into a mash that was floated on the surface ofthe water. The stupefied fish were then gathered byhand or in nets. The fish poison tree (Piscidia piscipula) of the beanfamily occurs in Texas, Florida, Mexico, the WestIndies, and South America. Its leaves, stems, and rootbark are macerated with a rum distillation residue orlime water. The material is then placed in baskets andfloated in the water until the stupefied fish surface.The plant contains piscidin, a mixture of two toxicglycosides.FISH POISONSScientific & Common Name Where Used ?Aesculus californica (California buckeye) CaliforniaChlorogalum pomeridianum (soaproot) CaliforniaClibadium spp. (Cunambi) AmazonConium maculatum (wasia) MexicoCroton setigerus (turkey mullein) CaliforniaDerris elliptica (tuba-root) AsiaEchinocystis fabacea (manroot) CaliforniaErythrina piscipula South AmericaHura crepitans (oassucu) South AmericaLomatium dissectum CaliforniaLonchocarpus spp. (barbasco) Tropical AmericaLycopus spp. (horehound) CaliforniaManihot esculenta (cassava) GuianaPatinoa sphaerocarpa AmazonPaullinia spp. (timbo) South AmericaPhyllanthus spp. South AmericaSapindus saponarius (amolli) MexicoSerjania spp. (timbo) South AmericaSmilacina sessilifolia (Solomon seal) CaliforniaTephrosia piscatoria South AmericaThevetia peruviana (jorro-jorro) BrazilTrichstema lanceolatum (blue curls) CaliforniaUmbellularia californica (pepperwood) CaliforniaWikstroemia spp. Hawai'iINSECTICIDESIn addition to the more exotic arrow and ordealpoisons, the plant kingdom yields useful poisons forthe control of insects. About 1200 different specieshave been used in this context, although onlyrotenone, pyrethrum, and nicotine are of any realcommercial value. One of these, rotenone, was usedfor centuries as a fish poison in South America beforeits use as an insecticide.Rotenone is a very popular insecticide derived fromthe roots of Derris and Lonchocarpus, both membersof the bean family. The former is native to the OldWorld tropics, while the latter is New World in itsdistribution. Rotenone was first isolated from Derris in1902. It is a colorless, crystalline compound extractedfrom the dried roots. Rotenone is insoluble in water,but soluble in oil. It is about fifteen times more toxicthan nicotine. The toxic principle has no effect onwarm blooded animals. Rotenone was isolated fromthe roots of Lonchocarpus in 1926. Its roots are richerin the toxin than those of Derris.Pyrethrum is the name given to the dried flowerheads of three species of Chrysanthemum. They yieldvolatile oils that paralyze insects. This came as nosurprise to horticulturists who knew that these plantswere rarely attacked by insects. Depending upon thespecies, the pyrethrum is often called \"Dalmatianinsect powder,\" \"Caucasian insect powder,\" or\"Persian insect powder.\" Pyrethrum has been usedsuccessfully in the control of flies, fleas, malarialmosquitos, and body lice.INSECTICIDES FROM PLANTSScientific Name (Common Name) CommentAnabasis ioaphylla Used in Near EastAnnona cherimola (cherimoya) Used against liceChrysanthemum cinerariifolium PyrethrumCroton texensis (croton) Used in New MexicoCymbopogon nardus (lemon grass) Citronella oilDelphinium spp. (larkspur) Seeds usedDerris spp. (tuba-root) Root source of rotenoneDolichos pseudopachyrrhizus Tropical Africa-173-Duboisia hopwoodii Leaves contain nornicotineEupatorium spp. (boneset) Eastern N.

Therefore, they are sometimes calledraticides. They are effective in small quantities, andappear to taste just fine.Squill or sea-onion (Drimia maritima) is aMediterranean member of the lily family. Since ancienttimes, its bulbs and extracts of the bulbs have beenused to kill rodents. If you or I eat this material, it willmake us sick and we will vomit, thereby ridding thesystem of the toxin. Rodents, on the other hand, haveno \"vomit control center\" in their brains so that anyplant parts consumed will remain in the stomach andbe absorbed. The sea-onion contains a series of toxinsthat affect the heart. They are called cardiacglycosides and they are chemically similar to thosefound in the foxglove plants. The sea-onion toxins,given by injection in moderation, have medicinal usesas diuretics, emetics, and expectorants.Sweet clover. One of the most pleasant smells ofrural areas is freshly mown pastures.

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) has emphasised the need to control the quality of HMs by using modern control techniques and standards (WHO, 1998). The application of molecular techniques in identifying substitute and adulterant species in HMs has been widely investigated; hence, DNA-based techniques have been used to accurately recognise plant species in HMs (Howard, 2010). Vassou et al. (2015) highlight the problems of species substitution and adulteration in their study of Indian country mallow also known as 'Bala' in Ayurveda (Sida cordifolia L.). They bought 25 market samples of raw material from thirteen states in India. They used DNA barcoding techniques to identify the species of the samples collected, and found that none of the samples were Sida cordifolia; instead, 76% were identified as other Sida species and the remaining 24% were from other genera. Several of the samples were identified as Sida acuta Burm.f. which has six times more ephedrine in comparison to Sida cordifolia; this may be associated with adverse effects. The research by Vassou et al. (2015) signifies the importance of species authentication of HMs and the applications of DNA barcoding for this purpose. Contamination of Herbal Medicines Substitution of ingredients or species, and contamination with toxic substances may be a particular concern especially when HMs are not regulated (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). On several occasions Ayurvedic formulations have been found to contain heavy metals such as iron, mercury, and arsenic which can release toxic compounds in the body altering normal metabolic pathways, and can cause systemic toxicity (Ernst, 1998; Egbuna and Bose, 2005). Saper et al. (2008) found nearly two hundred Ayurvedic preparations bought over the internet had detectable levels of heavy metals which were not stated on the label. A British poison information centre, in the West Midlands, identified five cases of heavy metal contamination within seven years; the products contained lead, zinc, mercury, arsenic, 10 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra aluminium, and tin. The individuals who had consumed the contaminated HMs had concentrations of heavy metals 2-10 times the upper limit of normal physiological values, resulting in harmful effects and morbidities (Bayly et al., 1995). Contamination with undeclared prescription medicines, mefenamic acid and diazepam, was identified in some Chinese HMs; they caused severe adverse effects including gastrointestinal bleeding and renal failure (Gertner et al., 1994). HMs contaminated with microbes due to poor manufacturing, harvesting, and storage conditions have also been documented (Zhang et al., 2012). This identifies that stringent controls need to be reinforced over the manufacture, sales and supply of high quality and safe HMs. Interactions between Herbal and Conventional Medicines Herbal medicines have been used long before written records were created; despite this there is still limited clinical evidence to support the safety and efficacy of most HMs (Ernst, 1998). The incidence of herb-drug interactions are still not fully known, and there is no reliable body of information to assess the potential problems (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011; Williamson et al., 2013). An interaction is believed to occur when the effects of a drug are changed by the presence of another substance (Baxter, 2008). The effects of the drug may be mimicked or opposed by the herbal medicine; which in turn may alter the efficacy of the drug. For example, St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is known to be an enzyme inducer, affecting the Cytochrome P450 enzymes; it has been associated with reducing levels of ciclosporin leading to transplant rejection as the efficacy of the drug was reduced (Graham et al., 2008; Williamson et al., 2013). There is an increased risk of toxicity if a drug's metabolism and clearance is inhibited, especially for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range such as digoxin, lithium, or theophylline (Colalto, 2010). Due to the lack of controlled research it is difficult to ascertain the prevalence of herb-drug interactions. This has been explored further in Chapter 3, section 3.4.4.1 (p91). Adverse Effects of Herbal Medicines There may be many side-effects associated with HMs which are not acknowledged; Ravindran et al. (2009) believe, ''traditional medicines are generally free of the deleterious side effects.'' In contrary Balaji (2010) expresses concerns of toxicity in using raw plant material / extracts by stating, ''laboratory findings suggest that turmeric extracts can be 11 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra toxic to the liver when taken in high doses, or for a prolonged period of time.'' There are several well-known Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) caused by the consumption of HMs including: burning sensation and skin irritation caused by chillies (Capsicum spp.) or Aloe vera L., allergic reactions to celery or nuts, blood disorders associated with garlic, and aristolochic acid induced nephrotoxicity (Chevallier, 2007; Michl et al., 2014). The Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) collates information on ADRs from over one hundred countries and in 2010 it found 12, 679 reports of ADRs linked to HMs (UMC, 2011). Adverse effects linked to HMs reported included: anaphylaxis, anxiety, dermatitis, chest pain, toxicity and death; due to heavy metal and microbial contamination, pesticide residues, and also the wrong species of plant used in preparation of the medicine (Sahoo et al., 2010). In the UK, the MHRA established the 'Yellow Card Scheme' (YCS) to monitor the safety of healthcare products including HMs; it was designed to enable HCPs and the public to report side-effects and ADRs caused by drugs and HMs (MHRA, 2014a). The reporting of herbal ADRs remains low, just 51 reports of herbal ADRs were received by the MHRA in 2014 (MHRA, 2014b; MHRA, 2014c). 1.4.5 Regulation of Herbal Medicines In response to some of the quality issues identified with HMs, the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) was established by the Department of Indian Systems of Medicines and Homoeopathy (ISM&H) in 2003 to regulate HMs in India. AYUSH proposed to regulate Ayurvedic formulations made in India that are often distributed worldwide, by focusing on research, quality control, and education relating to HMs. The Indian government declared that traditional herbal remedies needed scientific validation to promote national and international use of HMs which have been used for centuries (Sharma, 2000). The responsibility for ensuring the safety and standards of Ayurvedic preparations lies with AYUSH. The labelling requirements are clearly stated in AYUSH guidelines (Section III, Annex A). The scope of the AYUSH regulation covers, \"the product requirements, good manufacturing practices, requirements for competence of personnel and testing of AYUSH products included in the active pharmaceutical ingredient,\" (AYUSH, n.d.). An investigation by Saper et al. (2008) found nearly two hundred Ayurvedic preparations bought over the internet had detectable levels of heavy metals, which were not stated on the label. This highlights that products failing to comply with the guidelines are still readily available. There are concerns about the quality and safety of HMs bought online as it is difficult to regulate what is being sold via the internet (The Pharmaceutical Journal, 2002). 12 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra In Europe, the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive (THMPD) was passed in 2004 by the European Parliament and Council of Europe to set out guidelines to regulate the use of HMs (Directive 2004/24/EC). Previously HMs could be marketed without an official Marketing Authorisation (MA), as long as the unlicensed products were of high quality and safe for consumption, as decided by each country on a national level. The 2004/24/EC directive led to the development of Traditional Herbal Medicine Registration Scheme (THMRS) in the UK, which meant over-the-counter HMs which made a medicinal claim, would require a Traditional Herbal Medicine Registration (THR) or a MA, by May 2011. The legislation required herbal medicinal products to have at least 30 years of evidence of their traditional use in the EU; or 15 years within the EU and 15 years elsewhere for products from other countries (European Parliament, 2004). In addition, it required safety data to be provided and the manufacturer was obliged to guarantee the quality of the product with regards to Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) and European Pharmacopoeia standards. Manufacturers were also expected to ensure pharmacovigilance procedures were in place to monitor ADRs (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). The idea was to regulate high quality and safe HMs, in addition to giving consumers the confidence in the products they were using. As of the 30th April 2011 no unlicensed herbal medicinal product could be sold in the EU unless they held a product license. Products on the market before this date were given a three year period to sell through, until 30th April 2014. The Directive 2004/24/EC defines herbal medicinal products as, \"Any medicinal product, exclusively containing as active ingredients one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations, or one or more such herbal substances in combination with one or more such herbal preparations.\" It also defines: - Herbal substances as, \"All mainly whole, fragmented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi, lichen in an unprocessed, usually dried, form, but sometimes fresh. Certain exudates that have not been subjected to a specific treatment are also considered to be herbal substances. Herbal substances are precisely defined by the plant part used and the botanical name according to the binomial system (genus, species, variety and author),\" - Herbal preparations as, \"Preparations obtained by subjecting herbal substances to treatments such as extraction, distillation, expression, fractionation, purification, concentration or fermentation. These include comminuted or powdered herbal substances, tinctures, extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and processed exudates.\" 13 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 1.5 Overview of the Research Project The initial purpose of this research was to explore the use of HMs amongst diasporic SA communities in the UK, followed by the identification of plant species in HMs using molecular techniques (Appendix 1). As DNA-based identification techniques are a relatively new way of authenticating plant species, the research team was interested in studying this phenomenon further; with the prospect of developing a specific, fast, and reliable identification tool for a selected plant species. The first phase of this study was called the South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) Project (Chapter 2); whereby, the primary aim of investigating the current use of HMs by SA communities in the UK was explored. During the development of the SATMED project a questionnaire was designed to explore whether participants were using HMs, what they were using, where ingredients were sourced from, and where their knowledge of HMs originated. One of the key themes involved exploring whether or not participants shared the information about their use of HMs with their Western HCPs. After exploring a 'patients' perspective of HMs the researcher was intrigued to understand what HCPs thought of HMs. As there is very limited research which has looked at UK HCPs knowledge and views of HMs, it was anticipated that the results would provide an original contribution to the gap in the existing literature. An online survey to explore HCPs personal and professional experiences with HMs was created and distributed using social media (Chapter 3). From the results of the SATMED questionnaire a medicinal plant or herbal remedy which could be used for molecular analysis was identified. Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) was selected as the medicinal plant for a case study of the application of DNA analysis for confirmation of genetic identity, as tulsi was identified as a culturally and commercially valuable plant during the research period (Chapter 4). The cultural, religious and medicinal uses of tulsi were investigated during interviews with participants. Tulsi samples from participants, commercial sources, and authenticated specimen were collected for DNA analysis. This phase of the research was called the 'Tulsi Project'. All three aspects of the research overlap as the concepts are a continuation from each other (Figure 1-1). The Venn diagram in Figure 1-1 represents some of the key ideas explored within each section and some of the common themes which emerged through this research. Ethical approval from the De Montfort University Ethics Committee for each phase of the research was obtained separately (Appendix 1 & 2); further details can be found in each chapter (Chapter 2, 3, and 4). 14 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra A detailed introduction in each chapter explains the aims, objectives, and rationale for the section. As the methodology was tailored to each phase it is detailed within the specific chapter; followed by a detailed analysis of the results and a discussion. The final discussion chapter (Chapter 5) summarises the key findings of this research and illustrates how the three strands of this investigation integrate and support each other; furthermore, it highlights the implications of this research and further work which could be conducted. Figure 1-1 Venn Diagram to Illustrate the Integration of the Three Phases of the Research The Venn diagram shows how the SATMED Project, HCPs survey and the Tulsi Project interlink to explore the aims and objectives of this study. 15 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.0 South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) Project 2.1 Introduction The migration of South Asians (SAs) to the United Kingdom (UK) has created an ethnically diverse population; with SAs forming 5.3% of the total UK population as uncovered by the 2011 Census (Office for National Statistics, 2012). With the migration of people to the UK they have brought with them their own herbal remedies which they may still be using; however, there is little documented evidence to support the current use of herbal medicines (HMs) by SAs in the UK (Etkin and Elisabetsky, 2005; Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Pieroni and Torry, 2007). This raises several interesting questions such as where the knowledge originates from, how it is transmitted through generations, where ingredients for traditional remedies are obtained from, and if HMs are used in conjunction with conventional Western medicines (CWM) are Western healthcare professionals (HCPs) aware. The South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) project was designed to be an exploratory survey to establish the current use of HMs by South Asian (SA) communities in the UK. This chapter will summarise the aim and objectives of this research, followed by some background information to support the need to conduct this investigation. The methodology will describe the research methods used for the SATMED project and the results section will give a detailed analysis of the findings of this study. The terms herbal remedies, traditional herbal medicines (THM), and herbal medicines (HMs) will be used interchangeably throughout this research. 2.2 Aim of the SATMED Project The aim of the SATMED project is to explore the origins, use, and transmission of knowledge of traditional herbal medicines used amongst South Asian diasporic communities in the UK. 2.3 Objectives of the SATMED Project 1. Explore the knowledge and use of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian diasporic communities; describe where the knowledge originates from and how it is transmitted. 2. Investigate where ingredients for herbal medicines are sourced from. 16 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3. Obtain insight into the relationship between South Asian people who use herbal medicines and their healthcare professionals. 4. Summarise the types of herbal medicines and plants used within South Asian communities; to establish which plant species would be suitable candidates for DNA authentication. 2.4 Background Research In order to establish why focusing on SA populations for this research is important, the background of how migration to the UK first started will be considered. Then the types of HMs and traditional medical systems used by SAs will be established to determine the origins of HMs, and evidence to support the use of HMs will be explored. 2.4.1 South Asians in the UK The Formation of South Asia The first British men went to India as traders as part of the East Indian Company (EIC) in search of spices, silk, cotton, ivory and tea. The Indian subcontinent was rich in natural resources which Europeans wanted (Kaul, 2011). The EIC began to rule areas of India and developed its own armies. After almost a century of oppressive control in India by the EIC the Indians rebelled and the British Government rule was established in 1858 (Lambert, 2014). The two hundred years of British rule in India came to an end in 1947 after which India, which was once bigger than Europe, was partitioned into independent states. The main body was left as India while the eastern and western wings were called Pakistan (Figure 2-1). In 1971 East Pakistan was renamed as Bangladesh. After this the three states and Sri Lanka collectively formed South Asia, and its people were referred to as South Asians (Healy and Aslam, 1989; Clarke et al., 1990; Brown, 2006). Figure 2-1 Map of India Pre and Post Partitioning (adapted from Brown, 2006) 17 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Migration of South Asians to the UK Migration from South Asia started early in the 19th century when SAs first moved to countries such as Mauritius, British Guiana, and Trinidad (Clarke et al., 1990). By the late 20th century SAs had become widely spread across Europe, Africa, Asia, America, and the Middle East (Brown, 2006). Reasons for migration may have been forced (e.g. contracts of indenture or refugees), or free willed - the migration of traders, entrepreneurs, labourers, and professionals. Service in the British army took men from India across the world and as transport links improved, migration became easier so people emigrated to seek new opportunities. During the partitioning of India in 1947 there was large-scale immigration to the UK from India and Pakistan due to the violence and unrest. This first mass migration can be broadly divided into religious groups as Sikhs from India and Muslims from East and West Pakistan."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Sida cordifolia', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Sida cordifolia L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Sida', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Sida acuta Burm.f.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Hypericum perforatum L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Capsicum spp.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Aloe vera L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Ocimum tenuiflorum L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

This means medicinal plants can be used as food. They will not be classifi ed as medicines requiring a product licence just because they contain a medicinal substance. The same plant can be used as nutrition for healthy people and as medicine for sick people. 4.2.2.3 Biological and Chemical Safety Issues In China, besides the former Food Hygiene Law or the current Food Safety Law, there are a number of lower level decrees on particular biological safety issues on different types of products. These are, for example, separate regulations giving specifi c hygiene rules on food irradiation, meat and meat products, milk and milk products, eggs and egg products, aquatic products, condiments, sugar, alcohol, grain, edible vegetable oil, tea, edible mushrooms, street food, student food etc.819.Chinese food safety efforts at the farm level are primarily concerned with chemical residues in spite of the fact that food poisonings and deaths from microbial contamination exceed those from farm chemical exposure. China is developing good agricultural practice guidelines, ChinaGAPs, which will address minimising the risk of microbial contamination.820The Ministry of Agriculture is the lead agency promoting food safety at farm level. The ministry has created standards intended to guarantee that foods are free of contaminants. The \"pollution-free programme\" and the \"green food programme\" have standards specifying tolerances for harmful materials in soil, water, and air.821 They also regulate the use of fertilisers and pesticides, and set maximum residue levels. The programs include certifi ed production areas and trademarked symbols for use on consumer products. Packaged products carry information on the fi rm, which is a step towards a traceability system. Compliance is enforced by regular testing of soil, water, and air, and random testing of fi nal products for residues.822The above-mentioned programs are voluntary, and not yet commonly followed. In 2005, about 6 percent of the volume of agricultural production met the pollution free standard, and 1 percent the green standard, which is stricter.823 The decision to produce green or pollution-free food is usually made by local offi cials or agribusiness enterprises, not the individual farmers824. The trend is inevitably towards green food, though. This is because exports require 819 Kan - Zhang 2002.820 Calvin et al. 2006, 20-21.821 More specifi cally, the green food program defi nes two categories of green food. AA green food is equal to organic food, and A green food is between normal food and organic food. A green food is more realistic in China, as Chinese land is already heavily polluted. GMOs can be used in A but not AA green food.822 Calvin et al. 2006, 20. 823 Calvin et al. 2006, 20.824 Calvin et al. 2006, 21.-147-adherence to rather strict rules, and also because Chinese consumers are becoming more aware and cautious. Bian sees green food as a suitable compromise between organic food and normal food, particularly for developing countries. Following the green food standard does not make food too expensive, but use of fertilisers and pesticides is still heavily restricted.Besides regulations on contaminants and residues, chemical safety is the goal of regulations on food additives825 and food contact materials826. In Chinese law, \"food additive\" refers to any synthetic compound or natural substance put into food to improve its quality, colour, fragrance or taste, or for the sake of preservation or processing. \"Nutrition fortifi er\" refers to any natural or artifi cial food additive belonging to the category of natural nutrients that is put into food to increase its nutritive value.827According to Article 11 of the Food Hygiene Law, the production, marketing and use of food additives must conform to the hygiene standards for use of food additives and the hygiene control regulations. Food additives that do not conform to the hygiene standards and the hygiene control regulations may not be marketed and used. Specifi c standards on additives are given by the 2002 \"Administrative Provisions for Food Additive Hygiene\"828.In 2005, Chinese government organisations announced that food additives constitute the greatest threat to food safety in China. To address this problem, authorities promised to increase the number of quality specifi cations of food additives in line with global standards. In 2005, less than a quarter of all state quality specifi cations for food additives can be compared with international standards. The government promised to increase this ratio to at least a half by 2007.829Food contact materials were regulated by Articles 12 and 13 of the Food Hygiene Law: \"Containers, packaging, utensils and equipment used for food must conform to the hygiene standards and the hygiene control regulations. The raw materials for making containers, packaging, utensils and equipment used for food must meet hygiene requirements. The fi nished products should be easy to clean and disinfect. According to AP-Foodtechnology.com, the new Food Safety Law has alerady boosted food packaging business in China. The law has created demand for \"coated materials with barriers designed to keep bacteria out and freshness in the package\"830.4.2.2.4 Safety of Health Foods: Raw Materials Functional foods, fortifi ed foods, and vitamin and mineral supplements are in China regulated as health foods. Health foods are foods which have a specifi c health function, are suitable for a certain group of people, and which are not for therapeutic purposes. Requirements on health food safety and effi cacy are here discussed separately, even though these two aspects are in China evaluated in a single procedure. Health food effi cacy and claims are discussed in chapter 825 In 2002, 431 varieties of food additives and 1040 varieties of spices had been approved by the Ministry of Health.

China News. 830 News article at ap-foodtechnology.com, by Rory Harringon 20 October 2009.-148-5. Procedural rules on health foods (concerning the pre-market authorisation procedure) were discussed above in chapter 2. The legal basis for Chinese health food regulations was formerly in Articles 22 and 23 of the Chinese Food Hygiene Law. In Article 22 of the Chinese Food Hygiene Law, it refers to specifi c rules on health foods: \"With regard to food indicated to have specifi c health functions, the product and its description must be submitted to the administrative department of public health under the State Council for examination and approval. Hygiene standards and control measures for the production and marketing of the product are then formulated by the authority.\" According to Article 23 of the Food Hygiene Law, the food claiming to have specifi c health functions may not be harmful for human health. The content of the product manual shall be accurate and truthful while the functions and ingredients of the product shall be identical with the marketing claims.831 The new Food Safety Law states the same rules on health foods in its Article 51. It is fi rst stated, \"the state executes strict regulations on health foods\". Health foods may not pose acute, sub-acute or chronic hazard to the human body. Labels and instructions may not refer to disease treatment or prevention, all information and claims must be truthful, and the product must comply with the information. The Health Food Regulation of 1996832 and its subsequent amendments give more precise rules on health foods. The Health Food Regulation was enacted to strengthen the administration and supervision of health foods, ensuring the quality of health foods according to the Food Hygiene Law833. The regulations focus on evaluation and approval of health foods, and are as such directed more at authorities than at entrepreneurs. However, there are also sections regulating production and marketing of health foods.The regulations establish minimum safety and effi cacy requirements for health foods as follows:raw materials and fi nal products must comply with food hygiene requirements and shall -not cause any acute, sub chronic, or chronic harm to human body,necessary animal and/or human tests must have confi rmed a clear and stable health effect, -formulation and dosage must be based on scientifi c evidence (the functional ingredient -should be identifi ed but when that is impossible, at least the raw materials that cause the effect shall be listed),therapeutic effects shall not be claimed in labelling or advertising. - 834In addition to general hygiene rules, safety of health foods is controlled via controlling the choice of raw materials. A separate Notifi cation from 2002835 governs the raw materials of health foods. First of all, the Notifi cation aims to clear the situation of overlapping pieces of legislation. Novel foods are considered a separate issue from health foods. If a health food has novel ingredients, the Novel Food Regulation shall be followed. Further, if the health 831 Article 23 of the Chinese Food Hygiene Law.832 Ministry of Health: Administrative Regulations on Health Food, Order No. 46 (Promulgation Date: 1996-03-15; Effective Date: 1996-06-01. )833 Article 1.834 Health Food Regulation, Article 4.

Additionally, there are particular rules on fungal health foods836, probiotic health foods837, and nuclei acid type of health foods838. These products should follow these procedures respectively.839If health foods involve protected wild animals or plants, they should be applied according to Notifi cation of Restraining the Produce of Health Food using Wild Animal and Plants as Raw Materials of Ministry of Public Health of the Notifi cation of 5th July 2001 restraining the use of certain single materials840 that have anti-desert function in the wild.841 Other health food raw materials are regulated by three lists given by the Annexes of the Health Food Raw Material Regulation: List I includes materials that can be used either as foods or medicines. -List II includes materials that can be used as health food materials. -List III includes materials that are prohibited as health food materials. -The more complicated rules are given by point 5 of the Raw Material Notifi cation: First of all, if health foods involve products (or materials) of animals or plants, the -number of products (or materials) of animals or plants can not exceed 14.If health foods use products (or materials) that are not listed in the List of Materials -which are used as either Foods or Medicines, the number of products or materials of animals or plants cannot exceed 4.836 Regulation on Evaluation and Examination of Fungal Health Foods, valid from March 23rd 2001. Fungal health food means food with specifi c health function, which uses edible macro-fungi and carpophores and fi laments or fi lament macro-fungi. Fungal health food must be safe and dependable, i.e. safe for eating, non-toxic and not harmful. The strains used in production must have clear and stable characteristics of biology, genetics and functionality. Article 3. Only certain fungus species are permitted as health food ingredients. The permitted fungus species are the following: Saccharomyces cerevisae, Candida atilis, Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, Paecilomyces hepiali Chen et Dai, sp. Nov, Hirsutella hepiali Chen et Shen, Ganoderma lucidum, Ganoderma sinensis, Ganoderma tsugae, Monacus anka, Monacus purpures. Huang - Lapsley 2005, 266. If an entrepreneur wants a fungus to be added on the list, an application to the SFDA has to be made.837 Regulation on Evaluation and Examination of Probiotic Health Foods, valid from March 23rd 2001. Probiotic health food means preparation which promotes ecological balance of bacterial colony in the intestine and is benefi cial to human health. Article 2. The probiotic strains must belong to one of the normal bacterial colonies in human body. It is allowed to use live or dead bacteria and bacterial metabolites. The probiotic health food must be safe and dependable, i.e. safe for eating with no adverse reactions. The strains used in production must have clear and stable characteristics of biology, genetics and functionality. Only certain probiotic bacteria are allowed as health food raw materials. The permitted probiotics are the following: Bifi dobacterium bifi dum, Bifi dobacterium infantis, Bifi dobacterium longum, Bifi dobacterium breve, Bifi dobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus bulgarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobasillus casei subsp. Casei, Streptococcus thermophilus. Huang - Lapsley 2005, 266. If an entrepreneur wants a probiotic to be added on the list, an application to the SFDA has to be made.838 This means health foods using DNA or RNA as raw material. The purity of DNA or RNA must be above 80 percent, and the recommended dosage for nuclei health foods should be 0,6g-1,2g per day.

There is no English word for the latter two.841 Point 4 of the Notifi cation.-150-If health foods use products (or materials) of animals or plants not listed in the List of -Materials, which are used as either Foods or Medicines and neither in List of Materials, which can be used in Health Foods, the number of products (or materials) of animals or plants can not exceed 1. This product (or material) of animal or plant should go through safety and toxicology evaluation according to the Novel Food Regulation. If you want to use a material outside both lists, you can only use one which cannot be on the third list of forbidden materials. If you wish to use materials on the fi rst and the second list or merely on the second list, you can use four materials altogether. If you can settle with the materials listed in the fi rst list, then you can have 14 materials. Normal food materials are not included in this number, only materials with health effects. Category I includes approximately 90 materials, for example Hawthorn fruit (Fructus Crataegi), Barbary wolfberry fruit (Fructus Lycii), Lotus leaf (Folium Nelumbilis), Lotus seed (Semen Nelumbilis), Hemp seed (Fructus Cannabis), Ginkgo seed (Semen Ginkgo), Oyster Shell (Concha Ostreae), Honey (Apis Melifera), Peppermint (Herba Menthae), Peach seed (Semen Persicae), and Tangerine peel (Citrus Reticulata).842Some of the products containing these materials will be classifi ed as traditional medicines. Whether a product is a health food or a traditional medicine will depend on functions and marketing claims of the product. See the separation of foodstuffs and medicines above in section 3.Category II includes approximately 110 materials, for example Ginseng root, leaf and fruit (Radix Ginseng, Folium Ginseng, Fructus Ginseng), Deer embryo (Fetus Cervi), Deer bone (Fel Cervi), White peony root (Radix Paeoniae alba), Red peony root (Radix Paeoniae rubra), Aloe vera (Herba aloe), Magnolia fl ower (Flos magnoliae), Tortoise shell (Carapax et Plastrum testudinis), and Ginkgo leaf (Folium Ginkgo).843Category III includes approximately 60 materials, for example Poppy capsule (Pericarpium Papaveris), Quicksilver (Mercury), Chinese azalea fl ower (Flos Rhododendri mollis), Lily of the valley grass (Herba Convallariae majalis), Mung bean blister beetle (Lytta Caraganae pallas), and Blowfi sh (Globefi sh, Tetraodontiforms syn.

To each well of a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-one, Cellstar 650185, Kremsmunster, Austria), 150 uL of the cellsuspension was transferred for spheroid formation within 48 h.Then, MCF-7 spheroids were washed in PBS and transferred toCellTrackerTM green (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Karlsruhe,Germany) stained LEC monolayers that had been seeded into24-well plates (Costar 3524, Sigma) in 2 mL EGM2 MV medium(Vonach et al., 2011).Circular Chemorepellent-Induced Defect(CCID) AssayAfter 4 h of incubation of the co-cultures of MCF-7 spheroids(3,000 cells/spheroid) and the LEC monolayer, the size ofCCIDs in the LEC monolayer underneath the MCF-7 spheroidswas photographed with an Axiovert (Zeiss, Jena, Germany)fluorescence microscope to visualize CellTrackerTM (green)stained LECs underneath the spheroids (Madlener et al., 2010).CCID areas were calculated with the Axiovision Re. 4.5 software(Zeiss, Jena, Germany). MCF-7 spheroids were treated withsolvent (ethanol) as negative control. The CCID areas of at least15 spheroids per experiment were measured.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFrom the methanolic extract of the aerial parts from S. lucida,apolar compounds were depleted by extraction with petroleumether. After subsequent partition with chloroform and ethylacetate, the two organic fractions and the residue of the aqueousphase were tested in the CCID assay. The crude methanol extractsignificantly and linearly inhibited CCID formation betweenconcentrations of 0.25-1 mg/mL (Figure 1). At a concentrationof 0.25 mg/mL, the CF seemed to be even more effective than0.25 mg/mL of the methanol extract; however, this differencewas not significant. The EF was only active at 1 mg/mL and theAF was inactive at the tested concentrations.

Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assaywas chosen for further separation by CC on silica and five ofthe resulting sub-fractions (A-E) were active in the CCID assaywith sub-fraction A exhibiting the strongest inhibition (Figure 2).The EF was separated by size exclusion chromatography followedby solid phase extraction or another subsequent size exclusionchromatography. Due to the lower activity of the EF in theCCID assay, these sub-fractions were submitted to chemicalinvestigations only.The processes resulted in the elucidation of 14 compounds,one of which is a new natural product (Figure 3). The 13known compounds were identified by chromatographic, massspectrometric and/or spectroscopic dereplication with authenticsamples or data from literature. This led to the elucidation ofseven flavonoids. The widespread natural compounds astragalin(1), luteolin-7-O-glucoside (8), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (6),and rutin (7) were confirmed by TLC- and LC-DAD comparisonwith the authentic substances. To the best of our knowledge,only the two latter have been reported in the genus Scrophulariauntil now, namely, in Scrophularia ilwensis C. Koch (Calis et al.,1993). Two further, less prevalent flavonoids, nepitrin (4) andhomoplantaginin (2), had been isolated from S. ningpoensis (Liet al., 2009) and nepitrin also from S. striata (Monsef-Esfahaniet al., 2010) before. 1H-NMR- and 13C-NMR data of 2 correlatedexcellently with the data published earlier for homoplantaginin(Wang et al., 1998; Dawa et al., 2009). Hispidulin (9) was detectedfor the first time in a Scrophularia species and elucidated byLC-DAD comparison and LC-MS data.A new flavonoid (3) was identified by thorough MS and NMRexperiments: a molecular formula of C24H24O12 was determinedfrom the HRESIMS data. Fragmentation of the [M+H]+ ionat m/z 505.0 showed the loss of a 204 Da to yield a Y0 ionat m/z 301.3, which again lost a CH*3 in MS3, typical for amethoxy group bound to an aromatic system. The MS2, MS3, andMS4 spectra were nearly identical to those of homoplantaginin.Fragmentation of the [M-H]- ion at m/z 503.0 confirmed thisinformation. In addition, the loss of 60 Da (CH3COOH) inMS2 indicated acetylation of the glucose of homoplantaginin.The signals of 3 in the 1H-NMR spectrum excellently correlatedwith those of compound 2 (Table 1), despite a large downfieldshift of the proton at C-2'' in the sugar for 1.55 ppm. Thesignals of the protons at C-1'' and C-3'' were shifted downfieldfor 0.24 and 0.22 ppm, respectively, as well. Additionally, fromthe singlet at d = 2.038 ppm, linkage of an acetyl group wasdeduced. The connection of an additional acetyl group in position2'' of homoplantaginin was confirmed by the 13C-NMR data.The signals of C-1'' and C-3'' were shifted upfield for 2.28 andTABLE 1 | 1H NMR and 13C NMR data of compounds 2 and 3 in DMSO-d6.Compound 2 Compound 3Position 1H (ppm) JH.H (Hz) 13C (ppm) 1H (ppm) JH.H (Hz) 13C (ppm)2 C - - 164.3 - - 164.43 CH 6.86 s 102.7 6.87 s 102.74 C - - 182.3 - - 182.34a C - - 105.7 - - 106.15 C - - 152.5 - - 152.6OH 12.96 s - 12.97 s -6 C - - 132.5 - - 132.5CH3 3.77 s 60.3 3.65 s 60.27 C - - 156.5 - - 155.98 CH 7.02 94.3 7.03 s 94.78a C - - 152.1 - - 152.01' C - - 121.0 - - 120.92'/6' CH 7.95 d 8.8 128.6 7.94 d 8.9 128.63'/5' CH 6.94 d 8.8 116.0 6.94 d 8.9 116.04' C - - 161.4 - - 161.51'' CH 5.11 d 7.1 100.2 5.35 d 8.1 97.92'' CH 3.34 dd 7.1/9.6 73.2 4.89 dd 8.1/9.6 73.3C - - - - 169.3CH3 - - 2.04 s 20.83'' CH 3.32 dd 9.6/9.2 76.7 3.54 dd 9.6/9.1 73.84'' CH 3.21 dd 9.2/9.6 69.5 3.31 dd 9.1/9.7 69.65'' CH 3.47 ddd 9.6/ 6.0/2.1 77.3 3.58 ddd 9.7/6.0/2.1 77.56''a CH2 3.73 dd 2.1/11.6 60.6 3.77 dd 2.1/11.8 60.4b 3.49 dd 6.0/11.6 3.53 dd 6.0/11.8Further OH signals 10.405.435.124.6310.435.394.77Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 304238fphar-09-00304 March 28, 2018 Time: 17:7 # 7Lewenhofer et al. Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assay2.95 ppm, respectively. Signals of an acetyl group occurred atd = 169.26 ppm (quarternary C) and d = 20.82 ppm (methyl C).An HMBC crosspeak from the CH3 protons to the C-2'' finallyproofed the connectivity. Thus, compound 3 was unambiguouslyidentified as 2''-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin.The phenylpropanoid verbascoside, which had been detectedin many species of the Scrophulariaceae family (see, e.g., Zhanget al., 2013; Pasdaran et al., 2016, 2017; Venditti et al., 2016), wasisolated from S. lucida as well and identified by HPLC-DAD andMS.The genus is well-known for synthesizing a broad rangeof iridoids (De Santos Galindez et al., 2002) and two suchcompounds were isolated from and two further ones tentativelyidentified in the CF.The major iridoid was scrovalentinoside (14). The compoundwas elucidated by MS and NMR experiments (see SupplementaryMaterial). The spectroscopic data were in excellent accordancewith those published after isolation of the compound fromS. auriculata L. ssp. pseudoauriculata (Senn.) Bolos et Vigo(Giner et al., 1998) and from S. nodosa L. (Miyase and Mimatsu,1999).

The RTG calculation depends on cell number. As stated previously, during the 14-day phenotypic expression period the cells were sub-cultured routinely on alternate days but the author inadvertently did not record the figures, since sub-culturing was performed primarily to maintain a low cell number and cell viability will be determined after another 14-days (equation 2). However, based on visual observation made by the author, the cell number showed a dose-response relationship between sub-culturing procedures and the author believes that should the Relative Total Growth were calculated for cytotoxicity, the outcome would have be the same as that observed in Figure 5.6, where the phytochemical exerted a increasing cytotoxicity with increasing concentrations. Thus, the author recommends the inclusion of Relative Total Growth (RTG) calculation as part of | cytotoxicity assessment in this assay for a more accurate measurement since cell death during the long expression period was excluded in the cell viability calculation. This may lead to underestimation of cytotoxicity.This study showed that andrographolide is able to elicit point mutations in mammalian AHH-1 cells in vitro at a concentration as low as 5pM with the highest frequency of mutants recorded at 30pM. The biological significance of this finding remains to be seen.Copy1 2126CHAPTER 6GENERAL DISCUSSIONY. SharifuddinChapter 6CHAPTER 6 GENERAL DISCUSSIONi6.1. The Objectives of the StudiesThe studies discussed in this thesis were performed to investigate the potential genotoxicity and toxicity of andrographolide, an active phytochemical found in various parts of the annual herb Andrographis paniculata.Herbal products containing phytochemicals have long been an important part and parcel of traditional medicines, that were handed down from one generation of practitioners to another over hundreds of years. The plants to be used and its applications were carefully described in various older traditional healthcare systems such in China and Ayurveda in India, which are philosophically-based and regarded to be holistic in principle, which aim to treat the patient as a whole rather than singling the disease suffered by the patient. They have much in common with traditional medical herbalism as it was and still is practised in Europe and North America.In Part 1, Chapter 1 of this thesis, various factors involved in the revival of interest in phytomedicines, current UK and EU regulations in place regarding phytomedicines, the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines were discussed in length. Furthermore, the importance of phytochemicals in drug discovery and renewed interests exhibited by the | pharmaceutical industry in concordant with the emergence of new technologies, allowing new approaches in research and development of new chemical entities isolated from plants. However, this increased interests in harnessing the hidden knowledge described in ancient medical manuscripts or those trapped within the memory of its practitioners, are not always welcome by the developing countries who claimed that they are being subjected to biopiracy. These countries have various reasons to believe so due to their rich biodiversity, local socio-economic status and the high percentage of the local population that still trust and rely on traditional herbal medications. Brazil and Malaysia for example, armed themselves with strict legislation regarding the sample collection and exports of flora fromCopy 1 213Y. SharifuddinChapter 6the rainforests. India on the other hand had embarked on an expensively ambitious project,jchristened the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library with the objective of compiling a 30- million-page electronic encyclopaedia of ancient Indian medical systems of ayurveda, unani and siddha which date back thousands of years. This initiative is perfectly understandable in ensuring such knowledge remained in public hands rather than corporate patents, as the Indian government has been embroiled in many high-profile patent litigation cases challenging individuals and companies alike in the US and European Patent Offices.\\\\\\| Part 1 of the first chapter also detailing the importance of safety assessment of phytomedicines and phytochemicals for the benefit of both the general public and the industry. Introduction to the compound of interest, andrographolide and previous studies on the potential toxicity and genotoxicity of this phytochemical was also discussed.As elaborated previously, the increased consumption of traditional herbal products by the general public in conjunction with the perception that such products are entirely safe due to its 'natural' status and the paucity of reliable scientific data on their safety as well as their efficacy, should be immediately addressed. The author also believes that such opinions and attitudes by the public towards herbal products consumption would continue as the trend of leading a natural and 'green' lifestyle is currently in vogue. Data are lacking on various aspects of herbal medicines including subtle detrimental effects such as mutations, their impact on biotransformation as well as possible drug-herb interactions.Computer-assisted structure activity relationship programmes based on expert knowledge, namely DEREK and METEOR were employed to provide semi-qualitative predictions on the toxicity and possible metabolites of andrographolide. The in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMA) was used to investigate the potential of andrographolide to induce micronuclei, a reliable genotoxic biomarker in metabolically competent cell lines, i The assay was also combined with kinetochore labelling using CREST antibodies toI elucidate the mechanisms responsible in micronuclei induction (see Chapter 3).Cytotoxicity of andrographolide was also examined using microscopical identification of necrotic and apoptotic cells as well as trypan-blue exclusion assay. After andrographolide was found to act primarily in an aneugenic manner as opposed to being a clastogen, assessment of the compound's capacity to disrupt mitotic machinery and causing chromosome aberrations were assessed (see Chapter 4). In relation to disruption to mitoticCopy 1 214Y. SharifuddinChapter 6apparatus, mitotic outcome and cellular recovery after andrographolide exposure were also looked into. The data obtained on these studies assisted in providing better comprehension | of andrographolide's possible mode of action. It is generally accepted that aneugenic compounds possess a threshold of genotoxicity (COM, 2002), thus the underlying mode of action would also show a threshold of activity. HPRT forward mutation assay was chosen because it was suitably robust for qualitative and quantitative determination of genotoxic potential (see Chapter 5).|[i| In Silico Screening of Toxicity and Prediction of Andrographolide BiotransformationThe existence of high number of phytochemicals with wide structural diversity and the paucity of data on their various properties are some of the factors that is slowing down the research & development including safety assessment procedures. Computer-assisted structure activity relationship (CSAR) assessment allows semi-qualitative assessment and priority setting for testing strategies on high number of compounds before embarking on laboratory-based experiments. Two expert-knowledge-based programmes namely DEREK and METEOR were used to predict in silico the toxicity and biotransformation of andrographolide respectively. The results obtained using DEREK showed that andrographolide is capable of causing nephropathy in rodents as well as skin sensitisation and chromosome damage in mammals in vitro, where the latter is attributed to the presence a-alkylidene y-butyrolactone moiety detected as a, p-unsaturated ester or thioester by DEREK. Indeed, this particular part of the chemical structure among others was supported by experimental data to be responsible for the phytochemical's cytotoxic activity in vitro (Nanduri et al, 2004). It is worth pointing out that DEREK regarded the cytotoxic and | genotoxic potential of andrographolide to be plausible in vitro because the programme is examining the chemical structure of andrographolide whereas in vivo, the compound would | be subjected to biotransformation where the metabolites can either be more reactive or vice-versa. Thus METEOR was utilised to providing possible Phase I and II biotransformation routes of andrographolide. The various possible metabolites anticipated by METEOR exhibited similar outcome compared to those obtained experimentally. Previous studies involving rodents and small sample of human volunteers showed a variety of metabolites and all of these were anticipated by METEOR. However, the programme was not capable of determining whether these possible metabolites are more or less reactiveCopy 1 215Y. SharifuddinChapter 6than the parent compound. As discussed previously, CSAR programmes are useful in certain aspects but they can only complement but not overrule experimental findings.DEREK, METEOR or any other expert-knowledge-based programme can also be useful in priority setting for testing strategies, for example the European Union adopted a legislative|| proposal for a new chemical management system known as REACH that for one aspect, requires thousands of chemicals in cosmetics to be tested against skin irritation and yet the EU also warrants that testing of chemicals for cosmetic products in animals to end by 2009.6.2 Elucidating the Genotoxic Potential of Andrographolide In VitroThe results obtained using the CSAR programmes provided a sketch on andrographolide's toxicity portrait. The in vitro cytokinesis-block mironucleus assay (CBMA) in combination with anti-kinetochore labelling using CREST antibodies was used to paint a better picture of the portrait and it was revealed that andrographolide induced statistically significant micronuclei frequency at the lower concentrations tested, primarily in an aneugenic manner in V-79, AHH-1 and MCL-5 cell lines. There was significant difference in the frequency of micronuclei induction between the three cell lines tested and this may be attributed to the difference in metabolic capacity. Although V-79 cells are not metabolically competent, attributing the higher micronuclei frequency observed mainly due to biotransformation deficit might not be flawless. Ideally, data comparison between andrographolide-treated V- 79 cells supplemented with S9-liver extract and those that are not might provide a better picture on the effect metabolic enzymes upon andrographolide genotoxicity potential.1| However, the presence of external metabolic capacity such as S9 poses disadvantages of its own since the low levels of certain P450 cytochromes and high levels of others, does not j necessarily represent normal animal or human biotransformation process (Tweats et al 2007). Nonetheless, these data provided valuable insights into andrographolide biotransformation in human cell lines that also augment the in silico predictions derived from DEREK and METEOR. The V-79 cell line is deficient in p53 activity whereas AHH- 1 and MCL-5 cells are capable of undergoing normal DNA repair process and judging by available data on the frequency of micronuclei induction, the cells' p53 status were considered to be not of significant influence in cellular response towards andrographolide. Rajagopal et al. (2003) reported that the p53 status of cancer cells exposed toY. SharifuddinChapter 6andrographolide did not account for the anti-proliferative properties exerted by the compound.Andrographolide was also found to cause cell death in a dose-dependent fashion mainly via | necrosis rather than apoptosis. Different methods were employed to assess the cytotoxicityof the phytochemical of interest and the trend observed was similar. Cellular toxicity exerted by andrographolide was demonstrated to be dependent on dose and incubation time. When MCL-5 cells were treated with andrographolide for 8 hours, the frequency of apoptotic cells was most prominent at 30 and 50pM but was still not as high as cells that suffered necrosis. Prolonging the treatment period from 8 to 24 hours caused even more cells to undergo necrotic cell death whereas neither increment nor reduction was recorded for apoptotic cells and the value still lingered less than 2% of the cell population scored.Cell death induced by andrographolide was recently suggested to be independent of cellular caspase activities (Li et al., 2007). As discussed previously, andrographolide's influence on apoptosis is still not clear. There were reports of anti-apoptotic properties (Burgos et al.,2004; Chen et al., 2004) as well as pro-apoptotic effects in cells (Cheung et al., 2005; Kim & Milner, 2005) treated with andrographolide. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of these effects remained largely unexplored and it is still to be determined whether andrographolide impose its anti/pro-apoptotic effects via direct or indirect action on cellular target(s).The concentrations of andrographolide at 30 and 50pM administered to cells that elicited relatively high apoptotic response also educed comparatively high micronuclei incidence, suggesting a possible link between these doses, micronucleation and apoptotic responses. Decordier et al., (2005) proposed that increased caspase-3 activity has a direct role in | micronuclei formation. Indeed, caspase-3 activity, which is a distinguishing factor in| apoptosis execution, was observed to be up-regulated in the presence of andrographolidei(Li et al., 2007). It may be possible that this phytochemical only exert micronucleation at these concentrations after the cellular defense mechanisms has been overwhelmed or sufficient cellular target(s) has been damaged leading limited apoptotic reaction since cells die mainly via necrosis. Damage to cytoskeleton and other mitotic machinery may also initiate apoptosis (Decordier et al., 2002).Copy 1 217Y. SharifuddinChapter 6The phytochemical was demonstrated to inhibit cell growth and elicit cell death primarily via necrosis as the dose increased. Apoptosis was found to be a minor form of cell demise. Andrographolide exerts it cellular toxicity in time- and dose-dependent manner, where necrotic response was witnessed to be increased between 8 and 24 hours, in contrast to apoptosis which remained fairly stagnant during the same period. It seemed andrographolide has higher propensity to incite necrosis than the programmed cell death. Necrosis results from damage to a number of cellular constituents, including the plasma membrane. Several mechanisms alone or in combination can trigger and promote necrosis.These include plasma membrane permeability changes, which lead to a collapse of ion homeostasis, followed by cell and organelle swelling, and culminating in rupture of the cell membrane. For a given xenobiotic, the exact mechanisms leading to necrosis are not always known because the sequence of events is complex and many of these molecular events are causally interrelated with other mechanisms. Cause and effect cannot always be dissected from each other. Whether andrographolide inhibit apoptosis thus forcing damaged cells to die via necrosis, or various cellular targets were damaged by the compound and lead to necrosis, or a combination of both, is still not entirely clear.Although the genotoxicity portrait of this main phytochemical from Andrographis paniculata is clearer than before, it is still lacking refined colours. Since andrographolide act primarily in an aneugenic manner when inducing micronuclei, it may not directly acting on the DNA itself but exert its genotoxic influence indirectly by targeting various other cellular targets including but not limited to the mitotic machinery. The study on Chinese hamster lung fibroblast V-79 cells showed that andrographolide caused the numerical amplification of the microtubule organising centres (MTOCs) with corresponding aberration in chromosome segregation, which supported the data on micronuclei induction observed in V-79 cells as well as those in AHH-1 and MCL-5. This concentration- dependent effect also caused accruement of cells experiencing mitotic arrest. As the cells challenged with andrographolide harbours abnormal polarity during mitosis, it was deemed an interesting venture to see if such anomaly would give rise to cells with more than one nuclei. MCL-5 and V-79 cells were exposed to andrographolide for one and two cell cycles, subsequently cell fate and cell death frequency were determined microscopically.The presence of multiple MTOCs promoted aberrant mitoses. MCL-5 cells were also exposed to andrographolide for a longer period of 5 cell cycles in order to compare the mitotic outcome and cytotoxicity levels with cells challenged with the phytochemical in aCopy 1 218Y. SharifuddinChapter 6shorter treatment period. The data showed that longer treatment period elicit mitotic aberration, cell death and reduction in cell number. As andrographolide was shown to induce damage in aneugenic manner and aneugens are known to involve threshold of damage, the possibility of cells to recover after andrographolide exposure was also examined and the data revealed that the effect generally persisted.IiThe visual determination of MTOCs number is not hard and most studies rely on antibody- labelling followed by fluorescent microscopy. Although currently this is the preferred method, data has to be interpreted cautiously. Factors to be taken into account include antibody quality, the orientation of the centrosome relative to viewing and the fact that not every particle staining with anti-PCM antibodies necessarily represents a complete centrosome.The author believes that andrographolide may exerts it influence on mammalian cells as a parent compound and metabolism of the aglycone may reduced its genotoxicity, as shown by the observed differences in micronuclei induction between the cell lines adopted in these studies and various past publications cited in this thesis point to the same conclusion. However, it is inappropriate to speculate further until genotoxic experiments involving the possible metabolites of the compound can be performed and it is also remain to be seen if extensive metabolism (Phase I and II) would have an impact on the cytotoxicity of the compound without diminishing its reported medical properties.Andrographolide was shown to cause reduced sperm count, giant multinucleated cells formation and necrotic cell death in male rats (Akbarsha & Murugaian, 2000) and the author decided to elucidate the compounds possible mechanism of action(s) as part of the genotoxicity assessment. Furthermore, the phytochemical was previously demonstrated to be able to halt the growth of various cancer cells (Siripong et al., 1992; Rajagopal et al.,!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Andrographis paniculata', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['anti-apoptotic', 'anti/pro-apoptotic']}]}"}]}

Sometimes the search for useful or preciousplants was the principal justification for a voyage;at other times they were incidental.' The early voyages were not well-documented.Those of Columbus marked a turning point.' Sometimes the expeditions were paid for withprivate funds; mostly they were sponsored bymonarchs or government agencies.' Especially since the 1700's, naturalists and artistswere often part of the expedition.' These voyages brought back tens of thousands ofscientific specimens, principally to the greatbotanical research centers in Europe and theUnited States.' The explorers also brought back criticalethnographic data; the first knowledge thatEuropeans had of many of the world's peoples.' Exploration continues!3.2 ! THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE\"I simply do not know where to go next. I never tirefrom looking at such luxurious vegetation, which is sodifferent from ours. I believe there are many plantsand many trees that could be worth a lot in Spain foruse as dyes, spices, and medicines; but to my greatsorrow I do not recognize them.... I am the saddestman in the world for not knowing what kind of thingsthese are because I am very sure that they arevaluable. I am bringing a sample of everything I can. \"(Christopher Columbus)' ' ' ' 'Christopher Columbus was not the first person inhistory to be involved in some aspect of botanicalexploration. Hatshepsut [1495-1475 B. C. E.], Queenof Egypt, is often cited as the individual behind thefirst botanical expedition. She ordered a military partyto the Land of Punt to bring back myrrh and otheraromatic resins used in religious ceremonies. TheVenetian, Marco Polo [1254-1324], explored Asia from1271 to 1295. His memoirs contain many referencesto pepper, sesame oil, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, andcassia, and to the production of these spices. He alsowrote of how people used various plants, such asflavoring wine with rice and spices.A little over 500 years ago, Christopher Columbus and80 or so companions left on a long ocean voyage, andthe world has not been the same since. Why did heundertake this great adventure? It was not to provethat the earth was a globe. That had been acceptedfact for quite some time. Columbus told his potentialsponsors that his voyage had three goals:(1) to find a water route to the Indies;(2) to bring back precious materials, including thewealth of the Indies themselves (black pepper,cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, etc. ); and(3) to bring the message of Christianity to theheathen.Somewhat more privately, he suggested that some ofthis new found wealth could be used to freeJerusalem.If we look at how well he accomplished his statedgoals, we would have to conclude that Columbus wasa failure. He did not find the Indies, although hebelieved that he had until the day he died. He was notable to bring back caravels filled with precious spices.He did not succeed in bringing the message of hisreligion to the Indians.Perhaps we are being too harsh. Was he not the firstEuropean to travel to the New World? No! Norsemenvisited coastal North America in A. D. 900-1000. Theremay well have been Polynesian voyages to the Pacificside of South America centuries before Columbus.If he was not the first, at least he did discover a newworld. While it was new to him and to his companions,it was not new to the 60-70 million people who wereliving there at the time. It had been their home for10,000-60,000 years. They had built great cities in theAmericas when London and Paris were little more thandirty little villages.Why then do we make so much of a failed mission?The voyage of Columbus was the first documentedcontact. He kept diaries that we can still consult. Sofar as we know, he was also the first to return to theNew World, a second, third, and fourth time. He wasalso the first person to lay claim to what he hadfound. He became \"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" and theViceroy and Governor General of various lands.The true significance of the voyages of Columbus isthat he brought two existing worlds into contact withone another. He initiated communication andexchange -- a two-way movement of people, usefulplants and animals, harmful ones, ideas, prejudices,and diseases. This commerce has been called \"TheColumbian Exchange.\" His voyages and those whocame after him did create a New World.The log of the Santa Maria for 13 October 1492 givesus the first European reference to tobacco. \"In themiddle of the gulf ... I found a man in a canoecarrying a little piece of bread ... a gourd of water ...and some dry leaves which must be a thing very muchappreciated among them.\" Other major New World discoveries included maize(corn), the potato, many new kinds of beans, thepeanut, vanilla orchid, chocolate, pineapple, horse,-46-and turkey. The Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations cites four principal plants that feedour species: wheat, rice, maize, and the potato --three cereals and a root crop. Two are of New Worldorigin.A more complete listing of the two-way traffic thatconstitutes the Columbian Exchange follows:FROM THE NEW WORLD TO THE OLDCereals:Maize, wild-riceRoot Crops:Potato, sweet potato, Jerusalem artichoke, cassavaVegetables:Beans (lima, scarlet), squash, pumpkinsSpices/Flavorings:Peppers, vanilla, pimento, allspice, coriander(cilantro), chocolateFruits/Nuts:Pecan, black walnut, blueberry, cranberry,strawberry, persimmon, cashew, pineapple, guava,papaya, avocado, sunflowerBeverages:Cacao (chocolate)Medicinal/Psychoactive:Quinine, coca, tobaccoMiscellaneous:Rubber, sugar maple, turkey, slaves, syphilis (? )FROM THE OLD WORLD TO THE NEWCereals:Wheat, barley, rice, oats, millets (a group of small-grained cereals)Vegetables:Cabbage, lettuce, onions, watermelon, soybean,peas, lentilsSpices/Flavorings:Black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, apple, pear, citrusfruits, olive, bananaBeverages:Coffee, teaMedicinal/Psychoactive:Foxglove, opium, marijuanaMiscellaneous:Sugar cane, sugar beet, horse, cow, pig, chicken,honeybee, slaves, missionaries, smallpox,diphtheria, measles3.3 ! THE POLYNESIANEXCHANGEWhile much has been made, and justifiably so, of thevoyages of Columbus and their consequences, lessattention is often paid to the cultural and biologicalimportance of the earlier oceanic explorations madeby Asians who traveled to the far outposts of what wenow call Polynesia. The spread of these Proto-Polynesians and their plants and animals acrossthousands of miles and taking thousands of years tocomplete is one of the great events in human history.THE POLYNESIAN EXPANSIONB.

In many cases, the leader of theexpedition had no particular training or interest inbotany or natural history. However, the exploringparty often included specialists in various areas.Charles Darwin served on the H. M. S.

Nikolic, J.V. Zivkovic, A.M. Veselinovic, D.Atanaskovic, D. VlajinUniversity of Nis, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Chemistry,Bulevar dr Zorana Dindica 81, 18000 Nis, SerbiaINTRODUCTIONParacetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-p-aminophenol) is one of themost widely used analgesic and antipyretic drugs. Since misuse ofparacetamol may lead to serious toxic effects (eg. hepatic necrosis)its determination in various samples is of great importance (1).Numerous methods for paracetamol determination include the liquid-liquid extraction step during the sample preparation for the analysisand diethyl ether is often used for such purpose (2). However, as in thecase of some other phenolic compounds paracetamol is poorlyextracted with ethers and one way to overcame this problem is salting-out (3).The aim of this work was to study salting-out effects in the extractionof paracetamol with diethyl and diisopropyl ether from aqueous solu-tions containing inorganic salts.MATERIALS AND METHODSMATERIALSAll the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade purity andhave been used without further purification. Stock solutions of parac-etamol (0.01 mol dm-3) and inorganic salts were prepared by dissolvingexactly weighted mass of pure substances in doubly distilled waterand 0.01 mol dm-3 solution of HCl was added to adjust the pH valueof paracetamol solution to ~2. Just before each series of extractionsstock solution of paracetamol was diluted 100 times with doubly dis-tilled water or aqueous salt solutions. Extraction was performed by theshake-flask method for each aqueous phase composition in triplicate.MEASUREMENTS AND CALCULATIONSEvolution 60 UV/Vis scanning spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,USA) was used for absorbance measurements. The absorbance ofaqueous phases were measured at 243 nm and the distribution ratio(D) of paracetamol was calculated by using the equationwhere A0 and A were absorbances of the aqueous phases before andafter extraction, and Vaq and Vorg were the volumes of aqueous and or-ganic phase, respectively.Salting-out effect in the extraction of paracetamol was quantified bycalculating the salting coefficient, ks, according to the equation analo-gous to that given by Setschenow (4)log (D/D0) = ks'Cswhere D0 and D represented distribution ratios obtained in the extractionof paracetamol from pure aqueous solution and solution containing inor-ganic salt, respectively, and Cs was the concentration of salt in solution.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe dependence of log(D/D0) on the salt concentration for the parac-etamol extraction by diethyl ether is shown in Fig.1.Fig. 1: Dependence of log(D/D0) on the salt concentration in the aque-ous solution for the paracetamol extraction by diethyl ether.The values of salting-out constants for the extraction of paracetamolwith diethyl and diisopropyl ether from aqueous solutions of salts in-vestigated in this study are given in Table. 1.Table 1. Salting-out constants for the extraction of paracetamol withdiethyl and diisopropyl ether from aqueous salt solutions.For booth ethers used in this study we found that salting-out con-stants for the paracetamol extraction decreased in the orderks(NaCl) > ks(KCl) > ks(NH4Cl)the same order which was found for the extraction of catechol with di-ethyl ether (4) and extraction of 1-naphtol with carbon tetrachloride (5).Although salting-out constant for a particular substance/salt combi-nation is expected to be independent of the organic solvent appliedfor the extraction we obtained higher values for all three salts investi-gated in the case of diisopropyl ether. Some variability of ks(NaCl) val-ues was also observed for the 1-naphtol when different organicsolvents have been used for the extraction (5). In our case possible rea-son for higher ks values in the case of diisopropyl ether may be that itis much less soluble in water than diethyl ether. When comparingks(NaCl) values for different substances the value for paracetamol ob-tained in this study was much lower than the value for 1-naphtol (be-tween 0.195 and 0.218 for four different organic solvents) probablybecause of the more polar nature of paracetamol.Our results indicated that salts investigated in this study exhibited sig-nificant effect on the extraction efficiency of paracetamol with etherswhich could be used for improving sensitivity of analytical methodsusing liquid-liquid extraction for sample treatment as in the case ofcatechol and hydroquinone (3). Also these results may be used for bet-ter understanding of salting-out phenomenon and its dependence onthe chemical structure of various substances. 41PHARMACEUTICAL ANALYSIS / QUALITY ASSURANCE / REGULATORY AFFAIRS poster presentationsFIFTH CONGRESS OF PHARMACY OF MACEDONIA WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATIONMacedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011SaltSalting-out constantDiethyl ether Diisopropyl etherNaCl 0.118 0.162KCl 0.106 0.127NH4Cl 0.058 0.080ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science ofthe Republic of Serbia under the Project No. 172044.REFERENCES1.

Not onlysaliva can be obtained easily with minimal discomfort to the patient,but more importantly, salivary AED concentrations are assumed to re-flect their free levels in tissue and therefore may have greater clinical rel-evance than measurements of AED concentrations in serum/plasma (1).Carbamazepine and valproic acid, in view of their broad therapeuticspectrum and proven efficacy, are important and commonly useddrugs in the treatment of epilepsy (2, 3).The purpose of this study was to establish the reliable SPE-HPLCmethods for the determination of CBZ and VPA in saliva samples ob-tained from the epileptic patients undergoing chronic CBZ and VPAtherapy, in order to investigate the possibility to use saliva as analternative matrix for TDM of these AEDs.MATERIALS AND METHODSCHEMICALS AND REAGENTSCBZ, nitrazepam (IS), valproic acid sodium salt and octanoic acid (IS)were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Methanol and acetonitrile(HPLC grade), potassium dihydrogen phosphate and phosphoric acid(analytical grade) were obtained from Merck, Germany. For all analysis,HPLC grade water was used. OASIS HLB cartridges and SampliQ OPTcartridges used for sample preparation were supplied by Waters, USAand Agilent Technologies, USA, respectively. SALIVA SAMPLESSaliva was collected from healthy volunteers and from the epilepticpatients under oral chronic CBZ and VPA therapy. The saliva sampleswere frozen at -20oC until the analysis. The principles embodied in theHelsinki Declaration were adhered to and the Ethics Committee atthe Faculty of Pharmacy and the Faculty of Medicine, Ss.Cyril andMethodius University - Skopje, approved the research protocol for thisstudy.The extraction of the analytes from saliva samples was performed bymeans of a solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure using OASIS HLBcartridges for CBZ and SampliQ OPT cartridges for VPA determina-tion. CHROMATOGRAPHIC CONDITIONSThe separations were performed on Agilent 1100 HPLC system with:- CBZ: Zorbax Extend C18 column using isocratic elution with AcN andwater (35:65, v/v) as a mobile phase.

HCPs are at the forefront of primary care and need to be well equipped with the correct knowledge and training on HMs. It is not feasible for HCPs to advise patients about HMs if the background knowledge is lacking (Pokladnikova and Lie, 2008). 3.4.4 Taking Herbal Medicines alongside Western Medicines There may be several reasons why people try or use HMs in addition to CWM, including: the traditional use of HMs passed through generations, dissatisfaction with CWM, a desire to take control of their own health by making their own decisions, and curiosity to try natural and holistic therapies (Doel and Segrott 2003; Clarke et al., 2004). Furthermore, people may use HMs when CWM do not appear to be working, or to treat and manage the side effects of CWM; this is commonly seen in cancer patients having chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Sawyer et al., 1994; Ernst and Cassileth, 1998). In developing countries the high cost of pharmaceutical medicines, hospitals and medical facilities means the use of HMs is popular, as they may be a cheaper alternative (WHO, 2000). However, in the UK where medicines and treatment is often free on the National Health Service (NHS) taking HMs may actually be more expensive. During the SATMED questionnaires distribution there were mixed views about taking HMs with regards to the financial cost; some participants said they were not interested in using HMs as they had to pay for them but got their prescription medicines for free. While others mentioned it was expensive to buy ingredients for HMs in the UK but it was cheaper to bring them back from countries like India and Pakistan. The import of HMs from foreign countries leads to further risks such as contamination, adulteration, and misidentification of species (Chapter 4). HCPs views of combining THM with CWM are more likely to be determined by evidence based research and clinical guidelines, rather than the test of time (Heinrich, 2015). Awodele et al. (2012) disclosed that 41% (n = 123) of respondents in their survey to explore doctors view of THM, thought THM were effective for treating chronic conditions; although, none 91 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra of the doctors believed that THM alone could treat a patient. A comparison of UK and German general practitioners (GPs) attitudes towards CAM was done by Schmidt et al. (2002); they found GPs from both countries generally had a positive attitude towards CAM, although the Germans were more positive. GPs from the UK commonly referred patients for acupuncture, osteopathy and chiropractic treatment; while, significantly more German GPs referred their patients to herbal medicines. In the UK there is limited research to explore what HCPs think about combining HMs with CWM; this is an area which needs to be investigated further. There is a growing concern of serious interactions occurring between HMs and prescribed or over-the-counter CWM (Vickers et al., 2006). Smallwood (2005) says there is a risk of people not taking their CWM correctly or as prescribed if they use HMs. Vickers et al. (2006) found participants did not think it was important to tell their doctors about their use of HMs as they did not think they interacted or affected one another. The Ipsos MORI report (2008) revealed that 66% of participants thought it was safe to take HMs at the same time as CWM. The notion that HMs are natural and therefore safe misleads people to think HMs are safe and free from deleterious effects (Howells, 1996; Staines, 2011). Eisenberg et al. (1998) claim 60-70% of CAM users do not discuss it with their doctors, meaning patients will not get the opportunity to learn about the potential risks and interactions of combining HMs and CWM (Schmidt et al., 2002; Graham et al., 2008). If HCPs are not aware that their patients are taking HMs alongside CWM they will not be able to intervene, or identify potential adverse effects and interactions (Heinrich, 2015). Furthermore, it may affect the appropriate pharmaceutical care plan from being implemented which may cause further complications to the patients' health (Ramsay et al., 2005). Potential Herb-Drug Interactions Polypharmacy is the term used to describe the simultaneous consumption of several medicines by one person (Duerden et al., 2013). Multiple medicines may need to be taken to control or treat health problems, in which case there is always the possibility for drug interactions to occur. The definition of a drug interaction is, \"when the effects of one drug are changed by the presence of another drug, herbal medicine, food, drink or by some environmental chemical agent,\" (Baxter, 2008). Dureden et al. (2013) highlights that polypharmacy can be harmful due to the increased risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and impaired medication adherence if prescribed too many medicines. For CWM before any drug is licensed for use it undergoes rigorous testing, providing evidence for its clinical use. Details of potential drug interactions are also documented in several sources such as the 92 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra British National Formulary (BNF) and Stockley's Drug Interactions, which HCPs have access to. Various studies have found between 20-33% of the population use some form of CAM either alone or in addition to CWM (Freymann et al., 2006). Polypharmacy with CWM alone can be hazardous; but, by adding HMs it could further complicate the consequences. A herb-drug interaction is when the effect of a drug is altered by herbal products. Herb-drug interactions are based on the same principles of pharmacokinetics (i.e. affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination) and pharmacodynamics (i.e. drugs effects are mimicked or antagonised) as with conventional drug interactions (Chavez et al., 2006). Cytochrome (CYP) P450 are a group of enzymes which metabolise a variety of substrates and have an important role in drug metabolism. Enzyme-inducing herbals render drugs ineffective at sub-therapeutic levels as they are metabolised too fast. Alternatively when herbal products inhibit or reduce the rate of enzyme activity drugs will be metabolised slower than anticipated; this can cause the drug to accumulate and cause toxicity. Drug accumulation can be a serious problem especially for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, such as digoxin (Colalto, 2010). One of the most well-known herbal products which affects the CYP 3A4 isoenzyme, is St John's Wort (SJW) (Hypericum perforatum L.); it acts as an enzyme inducer which reduces the plasma concentration of certain drugs including carbamazepine (anti-epileptic), ciclosporin (immunosuppressant), statins and oral contraceptives (Komoroski et al., 2005; Graham et al., 2008). Hyperforin one of the active constituents in SJW induces P-glycoproteins in the intestinal wall reduces drug absorption. Furthermore, if taken with Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) a type of antidepressant such as citalopram or sertraline, it can cause serotonin syndrome; where the levels of serotonin become so high in the body that it can have fatal consequences (Chavez et al., 2006; Williamson et al., 2013). Fugh-Berman and Ernst, (2001) conducted a systematic review to explore the interactions between herbs and conventional drugs. They found that warfarin, a coumarin anti-coagulant, had the most interactions. Products such as garlic, gingko, ginseng, and even excessive consumption of green leafy vegetables can alter the anti-coagulant effects of warfarin (Chevallier, 2007). The mechanisms of how such interactions occur are not always understood or clinically significant; sometimes isolated reports of an interaction are the only indication of a potential interaction (Williamson et al., 2013). Warfarin is commonly initiated in patients who may have an increased risk of blood clotting, a history of a heart attack or stroke, or with prosthetic heart valves. It prevents the blood from clotting by inhibiting the conversion of hepatic vitamin K-dependent factors which reduce the amount of prothrombin produced; thus, reduces the rate of coagulation (Chavez et al., 2006). Foods which are high in vitamin K such as: cranberry juice, raisins, kiwi fruit, soya beans, 93 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra blackberries, blueberries, broccoli, and kale should be avoided by people taking warfarin (Fay, 2009). Despite being part of a healthy diet such products could affect the dose of warfarin required to have a therapeutic effect. It is very difficult to establish interactions between HMs and CWM as they are not frequently reported (Chavez et al., 2006). This may be because people who use HMs and HCPs lack the knowledge of herb-drug interactions (Vickers et al., 2006; Staines, 2011). In addition, if HCPs are not aware of patients taking HMs they cannot intervene or identify potential interactions (Heinrich, 2015). Communication between patients and their HCPs about HMs is vital to be able to identify potential herb-drug interactions and adverse effects from HMs (Vickers et al., 2006). The incidence of interactions between HMs and CWM is not fully known, and currently there is no way of establishing potential problems or clinical outcomes (Williamson et al., 2013). The main way of monitoring the safety of HMs is via the MHRA, which set up the yellow card scheme (Barnes, 2003; MHRA, 2014a). Publications such as Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions (Williamson et al., 2013) and Phytopharmacy - An Evidence Based Guide To Herbal Medicinal Products (Edwards et al., 2015) could be essential in educating HCPs about potential herb-drug interactions; however, unlike the BNF and Stockley's Drug Interactions such texts are not readily available for HCPs to access. 3.4.5 Using Social Media to Conduct Scientific Research The internet was made available to the public in 1991 with the introduction of the World Wide Web (WWW), which revolutionised how people learn, share information, and communicate (Vance et al., 2009). In the year 2000 just 26.8% of the UK population had access to the internet, in 2014 this had increased to 89.9% (Internet Live Stats, n.d). The launch of social media websites and applications such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube have increased the ease and speed of communication; social media may be used for social, leisure, or professional communications. An Ofcom report in 2013 estimated that 82% of the UK population aged over 16 had access to the internet, of which 53% used social media websites (Ofcom, 2013). For researchers this presents exciting opportunities to conduct research as it can be used as a valuable tool to identify and recruit participants (Beninger et al., 2014); which can lead to a snowball sample for exploratory work (Bhutta, 2012). With the rise in popularity and access to social media, Murphy et al. (2013) claim that researchers should look into new ways to engage respondents and capitalise on this evolving phenomenon. 94 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra State public health departments have also adopted the use of social media to share information and health promotion updates with the public (Thakeray et al., 2012), they have used Facebook and Twitter as a way of communicating with the general public and YouTube channels to help promote health awareness. The NHS UK has over 87 thousand followers on Twitter, while the Department of Health UK have over 161 thousand followers (Twitter, 2015); the followers were comprised of a mixture of HCPs and the general public. A study by Valdez et al. (2014) explored the benefits and challenges of recruiting for research studies related to consumer health information technology using Facebook. The study was composed of two phases which aimed to recruit specific populations: the first targeted a particular ethnic group (Filipino-American) and the second focused on type two diabetics. They posted messages on target groups and pages, and also sent private messages to administrators and people within the groups to recruit them for their research. They found that using social media structures such as Facebook was good for small samples providing qualitative data; but not so good for large samples for quantitative research. On the other hand, Bhutta (2012) used her personal Facebook networks and obtained over 4000 completed surveys for her research within one month. Valdez et al. (2014) highlight the importance of creating trust and transparency to successfully recruit participants. There are several advantages of conducting research using social media; it is a fast and efficient way of spreading a message, and getting instant feedback and replies (Sutton, 2010). Traditional methods of recruiting a sample can be time consuming and costly (Valdez et al., 2014). By using social media a large research sample can be recruited from different regions and even countries, allowing cross-cultural perspectives to be explored (Woodfield et al., 2013). It provides anonymity for participants who may not wish to disclose their personal details or identity, as they do not necessarily have to have any contact with the researchers (Beninger et al., 2014). In addition, as there is no facilitator present it eliminates the effects of researcher bias and may also give participants the freedom to express their views more open and honestly. It is cheaper than traditional research methods which may require printing and postage costs; in some cases it may even be free to set up an online survey. Once the research method, e.g. survey or focus group, is established it is easy to distribute the link to the survey and data can be collected quickly (Vance et al., 2009). There is an increasing number of people who have remote access to social media via multiple channels, e.g. smart mobile phones, netbooks, laptops, and tablets (Ofcom, 2013); therefore, online surveys can be completed quickly and instantly whilst on the go. Finally, as the data is collected electronically it reduces the risks of data input errors and is easier to analyse and store (Woodfield et al., 2013). 95 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra In spite of all the benefits of using social media to conduct research, there are also some disadvantages including: poor response rate, incomplete surveys, and the lack of control of the research population (i.e. cannot be sure of who is participating). This could be a particular problem if a specific research population is required but people who do not fall within the inclusion criteria participate. As the research is conducted without any face-to-face contact it may be difficult to keep participants engaged throughout the entire process. If participants do not understand a question there is no way of clarifying it, which may lead to unanswered questions or participants dropping out. The initial cost of some online research tools may be expensive, for example the basic survey on SurveyMonkey, an online survey development software, is free; however, this only enables a maximum of ten multiple choice questions and one hundred responses. In order to create a full survey where respondents can also write comments and unlimited responses can be collected it can cost from PS229 per year (SurveyMonkey, 2014). Considering that just over 50% of British adults use social media it would mean a significant portion of potential participants are not included in the research (Woodfield et al., 2013). One of the main drawbacks of this type of research is that because it is a fairly new concept it is difficult to apply traditional ethical principles to (Beninger et al., 2014). The Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (DTB) conducted some research to explore what HCPs knew about HMs using online surveys. They emailed 1,157 subscribers to the DTB and had a response rate of 14.2% (n=164). The limitations of this research were that they had a low response rate, it only targeted HCPs who had subscribed to the DTB, and was limited to mainly doctors and clinicians rather than a variety of HCPs; thus, limiting the generalisability of the results. Despite this they did uncover some interesting results (DTB, 2010). Using social media to conduct research provides a unique opportunity to engage a diverse range of people from around the world in a study, quickly and efficiently. Enabling researchers the freedom to explore concepts in an innovative way and people to share their thoughts and perspectives on a subject they are interested in (Woodfield et al., 2013). Traditional research methods have been tried and tested; their long standing use has been refined and guidelines to conduct ethical, safe, reliable and valid data are widely available. Conversely, the use of social media for conducting scientific research is a relatively new phenomenon; any new research done this was will help to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of this research method. Scientists should be willing to move with advances in technology instead of sticking to traditional methods (Murphy et al., 2013). 96 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.5 Methodology The following section details the research methods used to conduct this study; describing the design of the questionnaire, the participant inclusion criteria, how the survey was distributed, the ethical approval process, and how anonymity and confidentiality were maintained. 3.5.1 Questionnaire Design In order to explore HCPs opinions and knowledge of HMs a questionnaire to meet the aims and objectives of this investigation was constructed (Appendix 6); with a combination of open and closed questions to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data. It was designed to be an online, self-completion questionnaire, giving participants the flexibility to complete the survey in their own time (Moore, 2000). An introductory statement was created to advise participants on the purpose of the research and inclusion criteria (Appendix 7). Brent (2014) claims the more questions you ask the less time participants spend on each question. It was important to keep the questionnaire concise as it was anticipated that participants may be deterred from a lengthy survey."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Hypericum perforatum L.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'gingko', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

Four sets of experiment replicates using freshly prepared new stocks of andrographolide were used with five plates per dose in order for suitable statistical analysis to be performed. Only 60 out of 96 wells were examined for colony formations as the periphery wells around the 96-well plates were not suitable for scoring. The concentrations of andrographolide used in this study were changed and are slightly different where the higher doses of 70 and 90pM of the phytochemical were discarded because of previous cell viability studies demonstrated that more than 50% of the cells subjected to these doses died primarily due to necrosis. Instead, 1 and 5pM of andrographolide were used to examine the effect of the compound at lower concentrations while retaining other doses used previously.Table 5.1.

SharifuddinChapter 55.5 DISCUSSION| The HPRT mammalian forward mutation assay was employed to examine the potential;| mutagenicity of andrographolide, a phytochemical derived from the annual herb!Andrographis paniculata. To the best of the author's knowledge, there were no previous! publications to this date that attempted to elucidating the phytochemical's ability to elicitj point mutations using mammalian cell line.|| The AHH-1 cell line was chosen for this assay due to a proven track-record in its utilisationin genotoxicity testing. This lymphoblastoid cell line was chosen over rodent cell lines since human cells are known to be 1000 times more sensitive to some cytotoxic antibiotics at least six times more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and twice as sensitive to radiation (Cox et al., 1977a; Cox et al., 1977b; Hoffman et al., 1984; Gupta & Prasad, 1992). The HPRT forward mutation assay had been used successfully in the past in evaluating genotoxic potencies of mutagens (Crespi et al., 1985; Furth et al., 1981; Doak et al., 2007).The extract of the aerial parts of Andrographis paniculata with high andrographolide content was reported to be not mutagenic in vitro using the Ames test (Liu et al., 1990). As mentioned previously in the section 1.10 of Chapter 1, the use of aqueous extract of A. paniculata may hamper the bioavailability of the compound to cellular targets (Gupta et al., 1990; 1993; O'Neil et al., 2001) and the anti-bacterial property of andrographolide (Singha et al., 2003) may affect the Salmonella typhimurium bacteria used for the Ames test.The data generated from this study contradicted the findings made by Liu et al. (1990)j since andrographolide was shown to be capable of inducing mutation of the HPRT locus inAHH-1 cells in vitro. Andrographolide caused statistically significant (p<0.05) increases of HPRT mutations in a dose-related fashion between 5 to 30pM followed by the reduction in HPRT mutants frequency at the top dose of 50pM, where the value is still significantly (p<0.05) different against untreated cells. This mutagenic potential exerted by andrographolide on AHH-1 cells in vitro supported the DEREK report that this phytochemical can cause chromosome damage in mammals in vitro. The highest incidence of HPRT mutants was observed at 30p.M of andrographolide and as demonstrated earlier, the highest frequency of micronuclei was also registered at this particular concentration in AHH-1 cells.Ic degpyl 210Y SharifuddinChapter 5Although andrographolide was found to be mutagenic to AHH-1 cells in vitro, it also|\\ caused a consistent decrement in cell viability. Apart from the lowest dose tested which| was ljxM, all other doses exhibited significant (p<0.05) reduction in cell viability against\\ the negative controls. At the top dose tested, the phytochemical caused almost 50%reduction of viable cells, which was close to the 60% cytotoxicity mark. !|| Earlier, andrographolide was demonstrated to cause cytotoxicity in a dose- and time-[| dependent manner in V-79, AHH-1 and MCL-5 using different methods of assessment.I There were concerns that the measurements of cell viability immediately after exposure totoxic agents may underestimate or generate inaccurate cellular toxicity data (Greenwood et al., 2004; Fellows & O'Donovan, 2007). In this study, andrographolide-treated AHH-1 cells were subsequently allowed to grow for the next 14 days in the absence of the phytochemical and selective agent during the mutant expression period, registered a steady and statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in cell viability, measured as cloning efficiency. This finding provided additional support to the results obtained earlier that andrographolide caused a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity. Furthermore, it is now clear that this phytochemical might have a delayed effect on cytotoxicity even after its removal from the growth medium as demonstrated previously.Even though this is the first finding to exhibit the potential mutagenicity of this phytochemical, the mutagenic mode of action is not really known due to the paucity of data in the literature. It cannot be ascertain whether andrographolide is acting directly orI indirectly in causing mutations. Furthermore, as the treatment dose increased, so did cell|viability. Hence, mutations may not be passed efficiently since many of the cells will die.The author believes that further studies, including independent verification are warranted to elucidate the biological significance of this mutagenic potential and whether this in vitro effect can be translated in vivo. Data derived from in silico predictions using DEREK and this assay employing AHH-1 cell line did not take into account the influence of a more profound metabolic process in vivo. MCL-5 cell line that has superior metabolic ability than AHH-1 was found to be able to withstand andrographolide at 10pM and high micronuclei incidence was observed at 50pM compared to 30pM in AHH-1. Attempts to use MCL-5 cell line in this assay were not successful due to inconsistencies in plating efficiency values.Copy 1 211Y. SharifuddinChapter 5MCL-5 cell line only has limited Phase I biotransformation capacity and predictions made using METEOR with concordance to previous published studies, revealed various I biotransformation routes. Currently, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on andrographolide is still lacking and the serum concentration has not been determined. As a conclusion, andrographolide was shown to educe mutations in AHH-1 cells in vitro and further study is needed to determine the biological significance of this finding. However, the absence of initial experiments to determine the optimum expression period meant that AHH-1 cells harbouring larger intragenic mutations might have been lost before scoring can be performed, since andrographolide was shown to elicit chromosome damage."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'A. paniculata', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['anti-bacterial']}, {'scientific_name': 'Andrographis paniculata', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

This means that a product license can be admitted based on scientifi c literature published on the substance. The literature must show that the substance has established medical use and that it has acknowledged effi ciency and acceptable safety.1353 According to directive 1999/83/EC1354, a medicinal product, also a herbal medicinal product, has a record of well-established medicinal use if it has been used as a medicine in the EU territory for at least 10 years. In practice, applications for authorisation of herbal medicines are often based on established medicinal use, not clinical tests and trials1355.If someone wants to market an herbal medicine that does not have established medicinal use in Europe, he must complete clinical trials similar to those for synthetic medicines. Under the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), there is a Committee on Herbal Medicines. The Committee was established in 2004, and it gives scientifi c opinions on herbal medicines. One of the basic guidelines concerning herbal medicines drafted by the EMEA committees is the 2006 Guideline on Quality of Herbal Medicinal Products and Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products1356.5.5.1.3 Traditional Herbal MedicinesTraditional herbal medicines are a new European regulatory category created by Directive 2004/24/EC. It is a tailor-made category for products on which there is not enough scientifi c literature to make them well established in a sense that they could be authorised in the primary procedure for medicines. Traditional herbal medicines can be registered in a simplifi ed procedure called 'traditional-use registration'.According to preamble 5) of the Directive 2004/24/EC, \"the long tradition of the medicinal product makes it possible to reduce the need for clinical trials, in so far as the effi cacy of the medicinal product is plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience\". According to Article 16(a)(e), the data on the traditional use of the medicinal product must be suffi cient, in particular:the product must prove not to be harmful in the specifi ed conditions of use, and -the - pharmacological effects or effi cacy of the medicinal product must be plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience.This means that products categorised as traditional herbal medicines, require no clinical data to show proof of effi cacy. The difference between a literature-based herbal medicine application and a traditional herbal medicine registration is that in the primary procedure, 10 years of established medicinal use is enough, and in the simplifi ed procedure, 30 years of traditional use is enough. Established use means scientifi cally established through adequate published 1353 Enkovaara 2002, 20.1354 Commission Directive 1999/83/EC of 8 September 1999 amending the Annex to Council Directive 75/318/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to analytical, pharmacotoxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of medicinal products.1355 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.nam.fi /laaketeollisuus/rohdosvalmiste/kasvirohdosvalmiste/index.html.1356 Available on EMEA web page at: http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/qwp/281900en.pdf.-245-data. The borderline between established use and traditional use still remains unclear, and EMEA guidelines are expected on the subject.Because effi cacy of traditional herbal medicines is not based on scientifi c trials, there is certain mandatory information that must be given to the consumer. There is an obligation to include in the labelling, the package leafl et and in any advertising the information that the product is a traditional herbal medicinal product and that the effi cacy has not been clinically proven but relies exclusively on long-term use and experience; and that the user should consult a doctor or a qualifi ed medical practitioner if the symptoms persist during the use of the medicinal product.Compared to chemical medicines, there is still a relative lack of rigorous clinical trials on herbals. The effi cacy of herbal medicines has been tested in hundreds of clinical trials, but this volume of data is still small considering the thousands of plants that are used as medicines. Studies have shown that herbal medicines might often have fewer serious side effects compared to pharmaceuticals. They might also offer just as effective remedies with lower cost. However, the evidence on these benefi ts is incomplete.1357 This is why the legislator has had to settle with the above- described approach, where the product can be marketed based on history of use, but the consumer has to be informed of the lack of evidence. The decision on whether to trust a traditional herbal medicinal product is on the consumer.The lack of trials is mostly due to the fact that the herbal industry is small and can rarely afford the considerable expense of a clinical trial. Public funds are not often dedicated to research of herbal medicines. The EU directive harmonising the registration of herbal medicines did not offer any incentives for companies to invest further into research. Research is needed to enable knowledge-based use of herbal medicine.1358 At the moment, a consumer must rely more on faith and less on facts when using herbals. The lack of complete evidence is possibly holding back the optimal use of herbals. There are arguments against 'history of use' as a ground for authorisation. Historically, there have been long-standing traditions of treatments later proven to be ineffective.5.5.1.4 Homeopathic MedicinesHomeopathic products can be approved either in the primary authorisation procedure for medicines according to Article 16(1) or their own simplifi ed registration procedure according to Article 14(1) of the Medicinal Products Directive 2001/83/EC. In practice, the simplifi ed registration scheme \"appears to be applicable to the majority of homeopathic medicinal products\"1359. The primary procedure is problematic as regards Mutual Recognition. In case of disagreement between Member States, referrals to the EMEA Committee on Human Medicinal Products do not apply to homeopathic medicinal products.1360According to Article 14(3) of the Medicinal Products Directive, proof of therapeutic effi cacy is not required of the homeopathic products registered according to the simplifi ed procedure. Correspondingly, the labelling of those products shall bear the following information: 1357 Ernst 2003.1358 Ernst 2003. 1359 Report on EMEA Workshop on Homeopathic Medicinal Products. London, 27th October 2006. Page 6.1360 Report on EMEA Workshop on Homeopathic Medicinal Products. London, 27th October 2006. Page 7.-246-\"homeopathic medicinal product without approved therapeutic indications\".1361 Article 15 lists the information needed in the simplifi ed procedure. This information includes bibliographical data concerning the product's homeopathic nature1362. This means homeopathic use of the product must be presented, for instance, on the basis of the literature.1363The rules of the simplifi ed procedure indicate that a consumer must get the product (s)he orders, but effi cacy is not guaranteed. A consumer may or may not believe that because the product has been used in homeopathy for condition X, it is effective for condition X. As discussed above in chapter 4, the Member States may or may not establish the simplifi ed procedure. This had led to an unharmonised state, which creates obstacles to practitioners of homeopathy. The dispute on whether homeopathy is actually effective goes on worldwide. The Lancet attacked homeopathy in 2005 stating that a review of 110 trials found no convincing evidence the treatment worked any better than a placebo1364.5.5.2 Chinese Rules on Medicinal ClaimsThe rules on effi cacy and marketing are basically the same for modern and traditional medicines in China. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains a recognised and valued source of treatment1365. The Chinese government has supported the development of both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in China. As described above in chapter 4, the Chinese intend to be a global leader in bringing herbal medicine into the 21st century by establishing modern standards.1361 If homeopathic medicinal products are placed on the market with therapeutic indications or in a form, which may present risks that must be balanced against the desired therapeutic effect, the usual rules governing the authorisation to market medicinal products are applied. This means that in these cases, the same market authorisation and labelling rules apply as to immunological medicinal products.1362 Article 15: \"An application for special, simplifi ed registration may cover a series of medicinal products derived from the same homeopathic stock or stocks. The following documents shall be included with the application in order to demonstrate, in particular, the pharmaceutical quality and the batch-to-batch homogeneity of the products concerned: - scientifi c name or other name given in a pharmacopoeia of the homeopathic stock or stocks, together with a statement of the various routes of administration, pharmaceutical forms and degree of dilution to be registered, - dossier describing how the homeopathic stock or stocks is/are obtained and controlled, and justifying its/their homeopathic nature, on the basis of an adequate bibliography, - manufacture and control fi le for each pharmaceutical form and a description of the method of dilution and potentisation, - manufacturing authorisation for the medicinal product concerned, - copies of any registrations or authorisations obtained for the same medicinal product in other Member States, - one or more specimens or mock-ups of the outer packaging and the immediate packaging of the medicinal products to be registered, - data concerning the stability of the medicinal product. \"1363 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.nam.fi /english/pharma_industry/herbal_remedy/homeopathic/index.html.1364 BBC News 26 August 2005.1365 China-Britain Business Council. China-Britain Business Review Archive. -247-According to the new Chinese Standards and Measures on medicine advertising (2007), claims on the curative effects of medicines in advertisements must be scientifi c and accurate and may not contain any of the following content:unscientifi c assertion or guarantee of effi cacy; -claims of curative rate or effi ciency; -comparison of effects and safety with other medicines; -explicit or implicit suggestion that the drug can heal all diseases and is good for all -symptoms in contravention of the rules of science;suggestion that the medicine is \"safe with no toxic side effect\" or has \"very little toxic -side effect\";for proprietary Chinese medicine, explicit or implicit suggestion that it is \"natural\" and -guaranteed safe;explicit or implicit suggestion that the medicine is essential for normal daily life and -for the treatment of diseases;explicit or implicit suggestion that the medicine can help one cope with the tension of -modern life, studies or examination, and can help boost academic performance, energy, competitiveness, height and intelligence;other unscientifi c terms or suggestions such as \"the latest technology\", \"state-of-the-art -science\" and \"the most advanced methods of preparation\".The rules on therapeutic claims are thus the same for modern and traditional medicines, with no special categories for medicines without proven therapeutic effi cacy. However, the scientifi c criteria for effi cacy are not yet established.5.6 Food and Medicine Marketing: ConclusionsAs with safety, there are no particular rules on the marketing of functional foods. Again, this is because there is no legal category of functional foods. General marketing rules apply to the marketing of functional foods. Marketing must be decent and truthful. In addition, food marketing or medicine marketing rules apply. As with safety, marketing rules of foodstuffs vs. medicines vary considerably. The main difference is that foods are allowed to bear health claims, and medicines are to have medicinal claims.General rules on food marketing are largely the same within the EU and in China. The mandatory ingredient list will advise the consumer on what is in the product, and misleading advertising is prohibited. China has recently introduced legislation on nutrition labelling and nutrition claims, which is comparable to its European counterpart. Guideline daily amounts (GDA) are used as a guide for consumer.Health claims are allowed both in the EU and in China. In China, a category of health foods has been created. Health foods are the only foods that can bear health claims, and no foods can bear medicinal claims. The category of health foods is suitable for all foods with health effects, including normal foods, fortifi ed foods and food supplements. In Europe, normal foods, dietetic foods and food supplements can bear health claims. The EFSA and the Commission have defi ned the borderlines of nutrition claims and the two separate types of health claims: -248-function claims and disease risk reduction claims. The separation between disease risk reduction and disease prevention is the separation between foodstuffs and medicines.The general rules on medicine marketing are also largely the same in the EU and China. The basic law guarantees that consumers receive enough information on the use of the medicine, on its therapeutic effects, side effects, precautions etc. The law also prohibits typically unethical marketing methods such as targeting children. The Chinese government has recently improved laws on medicine marketing to tackle the serious problems that have occurred.With regard to effi cacy, which is closely related to the medicinal claim, the required scientifi c proof varies according to the type of medicinal product. In Europe, legislators have created separate categories of traditional herbal medicines and homeopathic medicines, for which no scientifi c proof of effi cacy needs to be presented. On the other hand, no therapeutic claims can be presented for these products. This means the legislator has left it up to the consumer to decide whether to trust the product based on tradition only. For regular medicines, the requirements for scientifi c tests and clinical trials are very strict, and the EMEA evaluates the evidence on behalf of the consumer.In China, foods have always been used for medicinal purposes. Medicinal products are divided into two: traditional Chinese medicines and modern medicines. Compared to Europe, China is putting more emphasis on traditional medicines and developing them side-by-side with modern medicines. China is building a science-based approach and modern legislation on traditional medicines. In the future, effi cacy of traditional medicines will be evaluated according to special legislation.The laws on marketing of foodstuffs and medicines are often disobeyed both in China and in Europe. Illegal marketing practices are common regarding health foods, dietetic foods and food supplements. These are often marketed as medicines. In China, there have been serious cases of fake medicines. With health-related products, certain factors lead to misleading marketing: Consumers are ignorant compared to businesses, consumers cannot immediately determine if the product is effective or not, and health is so important to consumers that they are willing to pay for it even if the result is uncertain. This means there are lucrative earnings available for swindlers. It is a challenging job for legislators to make deception unprofi table. -249-6 CASE: THREE CHINESE BERRIES6.1 Case IntroductionIn this chapter, we draw conclusions on the European and Chinese legal systems from an entrepreneur's perspective. For this purpose, a case concerning fi ctional health-enhancing products and their legal status is presented. This means investigating how the legislation works in the situation of three Chinese plants aimed at fi ghting the metabolic syndrome.The chosen plants are:Hawthorn fruit (1) Crataegus pinnatifi da, Chinese hawthorn)Emblic leaffl ower fruit (2) Phyllanthus emblica), andChinese wolfberry fruit (3) Lycium barbarum L.).1) 2) 3) These berries have qualities that make them promising raw materials for functional foods. We are interested in how these plants are/would be legally evaluated in EU and in China. Our hypothetical goal is to produce functional foods utilising the health-enhancing properties of these three berries, and to legally sell the products to consumers.The important legal questions are:Which are the applicable rules?A) Is it possible to sell the products as foods and/or medicines?B) If foods, will the products be classifi ed as novel foods?C) If novel foods, which are the requirements for authorisation?D) Which will be the marketing claims available?E) Exotic fruits and berries have shot to popularity in the last couple of years, particularly because of their antioxidants and vitamin C. The food industry calls this the 'superfruit' trend. -250-Food and beverage manufacturers are developing products to reply to consumer demand for wolfberries, cranberries, noni, and blackberries for example.1366 6.2 Scientifi c Background6.2.1 Target DiseasesThe metabolic syndrome is a condition where a person is overweight and in risk of getting cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This means the person has high blood pressure, low level of (good) HDL cholesterol, high level of (bad) LDL cholesterol, insulin resistance and/or glucose intolerance. The condition is called metabolic syndrome, because the risk of contracting heart trouble and the risk of getting diabetes are often associated with the same persons. The lipid (fat) metabolism and the glucose (sugar) metabolism are closely connected, and both are connected to obesity. By treating metabolic syndrome it is possible to prevent type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Researchers link the rise in metabolic syndrome to growing affl uence, changing lifestyles and growing urbanisation1367. The syndrome is common in middle-aged and older persons. According to Hu et al., the overall prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in non-diabetic adult Europeans is 15%1368. The WHO estimates that metabolic syndrome is present in 7-36% of European men and 5-22% of women aged 40-55 years1369. According to a 2005 study, 13.7 % of Chinese adults has metabolic syndrome1370. According to He et al., the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is 46% in Beijing elderly people1371, 35% in men, 54 in women1372.1373These fi gures are important as they point out that the syndrome causes a lot of human suffering and huge economic losses. What is interesting to us is that obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are largely nutrition problems.1374 The metabolic syndrome can often be prevented and/or treated by diet, where functional foods can be one part of dietary therapy.Obesity is the basic culprit for many health problems. Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.1375 In Europe, around half of the adult population 1366 Nutraingredients.com Europe."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Crataegus pinnatifi da', 'medical_conditions': ['metabolic syndrome'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Phyllanthus emblica', 'medical_conditions': ['metabolic syndrome'], 'medicinal_effects': None}, {'scientific_name': 'Lycium barbarum L.', 'medical_conditions': ['metabolic syndrome'], 'medicinal_effects': None}]}"}]}

WOOD, ITSBYPRODUCTS, & CORKANATOMICAL STRUCTUREWhen we first attempt to describe or identify a plant,we often note whether it is an herb, a shrub, or a tree.This classification has served us well since prehistorictimes. While useful, it is misleading in the sense thatherbs, shrubs, and trees are structurally quite similarto one another. They are composed of the same planttissues. Beginning at the outside and working our wayto the center they are the epidermis, cortex, pericycle,phloem, cambium, xylem, and pith. The differencebetween an herbaceous and a woody plant is notwhether one or more of these tissues is present orabsent, but the degree to which particular tissuescontinue to be produced year after year. In a woodyplant, the incremental growth of the outer four tissues(epidermis, cortex, pericyle, and phloem) constitutethe bark, a tough, protective outer layer. Herbs mayhave a light covering of bark on their stems andbranches, but not to the degree that we encounter inshrubs and trees. These tissues are, for the most part,dead at maturity. Beneath the bark lies the cambium, a living tissue thatcontinues to undergo repeated cell divisions during thelife of the plant. It will produce some additionalphloem tissue to the outside and significant additionalxylem tissue toward the inside. Plant anatomists referto these as the secondary phloem and secondaryxylem, respectively. Xylem and phloem are theplumbing system of a plant. They are the tissuesthrough which water and nutrients flow. Most of thesetissues will also be dead at maturity. The chiefdifference between an herbaceous plant and a woodyone is that the latter continue to build layer upon layerof secondary xylem in annual increments (annualrings). In other words, most of what we call wood issecondary xylem. Also note that when you look at aperfectly healthy, mature tree most of its stem system(the trunk and branches) are composed of dead cells.In fact, xylem tissue will not be fully functional as thewater plumbing system of the stem until it is dead andits cell contents (cytoplasm) have dissolved. Theportion of the xylem tissue that conducts water iscalled sapwood; the portion that is no longerfunctional is the heartwood.Forestry and lumber industry people recognize twomajor categories of woody plants -- hardwoods andsoftwoods. The terms are confusing, because theysuggest some feature of the wood itself; somemeasure of its density or hardness. Instead, they tellus whether the wood comes from a conifer (softwood)or from a flowering plant (hardwood). While it is truethat there are fundamental anatomical differencesbetween the xylem tissues of most conifers and mostflowering plants, they do not lead to a soft wood inone group and a hard wood in the other.CHEMICAL STRUCTUREFrom a chemical viewpoint, wood is primarilycellulose and lignins. Cellulose is a carbohydratepolymer -- a long molecule made of many glucoseresides (C6H10O5) linked to one another. You know ofglucose, a monosaccharide sugar (C6H12O6). Theorganization of these glucose residues becomes quitecomplex. The structure of glucose remains an activesubject of research. Cellulose is found in other partsof the plant, as well. Grass leaves are high incellulose. One of the reasons that we havedomesticated certain animals is that their digestivesystems are able to deal with these molecules,because ours lack the enzymes needed to break downcellulose. Lignin is the other main constituent of wood.A typical wood sample will contain about half as muchlignin as cellulose. It is also a high polymer ofrepeating phenylpropanoid molecules. I do not havethe slightest idea what phenylpropanoid moleculesare. Lignin breaks down even less easily thancellulose. By the way, much of the foul smellassociated with paper pulping mills comes from thelignin residue that is a byproduct of paper making.CHARACTERISTICS OF WOODColor. Woods come in a variety of colors, includingyellow, black, red, white, green, purple, and variousstriped combinations. These result from pigments inthe xylem.Porosity refers to the number, size, and distributionof larger cells (vessels) in the wood. It will determinehow readily a kind of wood takes paint or is resistantto decay. Some trees, such as maple and basswood,have their vessels scattered through the wood(diffuse-porous). Other woods, such as those fromoaks, walnuts, elms, and ashes have vessels that areparallel to the annual rings (ring-porous).Grain is the technical term for the alignment of cellsthat make up the xylem tissue. All of them can beparallel to the vertical axis of the tree, such that across-section cuts neatly through all of them. Some liethat angles so that an oblique cut is produced. Othersare arranged spirally. Grain is a major feature indetermining the aesthetic appeal of a particular wood.Density of a wood is its weight divided by its volume.-132-The industry standard calls for measuring an oven-dried cube of wood 1 cm on each side. Because 1 cm3of water weighs 1 gram, any wood that has a densityof less than 1.0 will float in water; those with adensity of greater than 1.0 will sink. Balsa wood isprobably the lightest, with a density of 0.13grams/cm3. You have probably seen balsa woodwithout knowing it. Think about the thin, light woodused to make model airplanes. At the other end of thescale are lignum vitae and quebracho with densities ofabout 1.25 grams/cm3. Densities for woods fromvarious North American trees include: incense cedar,0.35; Douglas-fir, 0.45; redwood, 0.41; ponderosapine, 0.38; white ash, 0.55; black cherry, 0.47;American elm, 0.46; white oak, 0.60; sycamore, 0.46;and black walnut, 0.51.Durability. Woods vary greatly in the kinds ofchemicals, such as phenolic and terpenoidcompounds, that they deposit in their heartwood. Thisdetermines the durability of the wood. In some trees,such as redwood and bald-cypress, the deposition ofvarious compounds retards the growth of fungi andbacteria that would otherwise decompose the woodover a period of time. On the other hand, basswoodand poplar (usually misspelled and mispronounced\"popular\") decay comparatively rapidly. Because mostwoods will last much longer if they are kept dry, wehave developed a series of preservatives, such aspaints, varnishes, creosotes, and tar oils that we applyto their surfaces.Moisture content. The amount of moisture in woodranges from about 70% to 7%, with the sapwoodhaving a higher water content than the heartwood. Inmost instances, woods with a lower water content arepreferable to those with more moisture.Mechanical Properties. Cleavability is an index ofhow easily wood can be split. When we want to chopfirewood, we want a wood that cleaves easily. Whenwe are constructing something that requires us to usenails or screws in the wood, we want low cleavability.In addition, there are a number of mechanicalproperties of wood that must be taken into account.They include stiffness, tensile strength, shearstrength, crushing strength, and cross-breakingstrength. The particular use intended for the wood willdetermine which of these features is critical.THE USES OF WOODFUEL. Until the development of alternate energysources, such as coal, oil, gasoline, electricity, andnuclear materials, we burned wood. Even today, about1 billion m3 of wood is consumed by burning it as fuel.In North America, only about 10% of our annualtimber harvest goes for fuel, but in Latin Americanand Africa that figure is much closer to 90%. In thiscountry, wood is a primary fuel in some of the morerural areas. Woods vary considerably in the way thatthey burn. This is a function of their physical andchemical structure. Obviously the density and drynessof the wood are important factors. Most woods willyield about 4 calories of heat for each gram burned.When we burn a piece of wood, the first phaseinvolves evaporation of water. This requires heat.Then comes the vaporization of volatile materials inthe wood at we observe as the flame of the fire. Manyconifers are a problem in this regard because theirwood is impregnated with resins that will formflammable deposits on the interior of stove pipes andchimneys."}, {"role": "assistant", "content":

"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Turmeric (Curcuma longa L., Indian name: haldi) is commonly known as a spice, colorant and food preservative, which has several proposed medicinal benefits. It is said to have antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects (Colalto, 2010). Curcumin, identified as the yellow pigment in turmeric, is a compound found in the rhizome of the plant; which is a therapeutically active component in turmeric responsible for its versatile medicinal properties (Sikora et al., 2010). Chemotherapeutic agents inhibit the hyperproliferation of cells, which develop into cancer. Synthetic drugs are often expensive, difficult to synthesise and have multiple side effects. On the other hand, curcumin extracted from turmeric is cheap, widely available, and is believed to kill tumour cells as it interferes with several cell signalling pathways that cause cell death by apoptosis and necrosis (Ravindran, et al., 2009; Sikora et al., 2010). Garlic (Allium sativum L., Indian name: lasan) is another popular ingredient used in many herbal formulations; which is believed to have antibacterial, anti-platelet, and anti-hypertensive effects. The therapeutically active components recognised in garlic are allicin and alliin (Colalto, 2010; Garodia, 2006). A review by Tovar and Petzel (2009) analysed the efficacy of garlic for treating dyslipidaemia, and its action in reducing high cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis; 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase. Garlic is effective at reducing low density lipids and triglycerides which contribute to high cholesterol; accordingly the benefits of reduced cholesterol correlate to reduced risk of stroke and heart disease. The antibacterial action of garlic was also observed in the West by the renowned scientist Louis Pasteur in 1858, who noted that bacteria died when they were exposed to garlic; crushed garlic juice was also used during the Second World War in wounds to prevent infections (Taylor, 2007; Arora and Kaur, 1999; Williamson, 2002). The mode of action is believed to be due to the active molecules, allicin 25 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra and alliin which interfere with thiol groups on bacterial and fungal enzymes, affecting essential metabolism leading to cell death, thus eradicating the organism (Williamson, 2002). There are numerous HMs which are getting recognition for their pharmacological effects in the Western world. Dentists commonly recommend cloves (Eugenia caryophylatta Thunb., Indian name: long) to their patients for toothaches. The dried flower buds have powerful anaesthetic, analgesic, antiseptic, antimicrobial and anti-emetic effects (Chevallier, 2007). Eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) has been identified as the active substance responsible for many of the medicinal benefits of cloves. The culinary use of cloves is not only to add a spicy aromatic flavour, but traditionally it was added to prevent food spoilage and to aid digestion (Trajano et al., 2010). Another product which is being recognised for its cosmetic value is neem (Azadirachta indica A.Juss. ); commercial soaps, shampoos, face washes, creams and lotions are now readily available. The neem tree is native to South Asia, and can grow up to thirty five meters tall; all parts of the tree can be used including the seeds, leaves and bark. It has been described as a pharmacy in its own right due to the many health benefits associated with it (Chevallier, 2007), including: antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, antipruritic, anti-cancer and a blood purifying properties (Kumar et al., 2006; Boursier et al., 2011; Pandikumar et al., 2011). The Foundation for Revitalisation of Local Health Traditions (FRLHT) in Bangalore, India, has established various projects across India to document the use of traditional HMs. One of the key priorities is to build a bridge between the traditional use and knowledge of HMs and modern scientific advances. By engaging in clinical research the FRLHT aims to establish clinical theories to support traditional use of HMs. By working with local communities, farmers, traditional healers, schools and educational institutes they have tried to preserve cultural heritage, cultivate sustainable resources, and provide an evidence base for traditional Ayurvedic practices (FRLHT, 2015). 2.4.4 Ethnopharmacological Research in the UK Ethnopharmacology is \"the scientific study of ethnic groups and their use of drugs\" (Johnson and Sargent, 1996). Ethnopharmacological research involves a multi-disciplinary approach whereby botany, chemistry, pharmacognosy, pharmacology and other disciplines are considered to document traditional knowledge and use of medicinal plants (King, 1992; Patwardhan, 2005; Heinrich et al., 2006). The research methods used are diverse and tailored to the objectives of the investigation (Elisabetsky and Etkin, 2009). Plant material may be collected, identified and examined by botanists and other scientists while social science 26 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra inquires may be conducted to explore the medicinal ethnography (Elisabetsky and Etkin, 2009; Mukherjee et al., 2010). By combining methodologies from several disciplines such as social and natural science the objective of ethnopharmacological research which sets out to explore and understand traditional systems of medicine can be attained (Elisabetsky and Etkin, 2009). There is a vast amount of ethnopharmacological research which has explored the use of traditional HMs by people around the world (Chhetri, 1994; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Malla and Chhetri, 2009; Kunwar et al., 2010; Ayyanar and Ignacimuthu, 2011; Bhatia et al., 2014). Pieroni et al. (2010) claims that most ethnobotanical research is conducted in exotic places and that a gradual shift towards exploring what is going on in 'back yards and urban environments' will occur. They go on to say that ethnobotanists began to explore the use of plants by migrant populations in the late 1990s in North America; this was driven by an increasing interest in the use and perception of traditional HMs. In the UK, surveys to explore the use of HMs have been conducted (Ipsos MORI, 2008; Mintel, 2009); however, there is limited research into the use of HMs by SA communities in the UK (Bhopal, 1986a; Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Pieroni and Torry, 2007; Pieroni et al., 2010). Bhopal (1986a) conducted interviews with 65 Asian participants in Glasgow to explore the role of TM in an Asian community. He discovered that the knowledge of HMs amongst participants was high, but HMs only had a modest role in participants' healthcare. Participants did not feel it was necessary to disclose information about their use of HMs to their HCPs; so Bhopal explored HCPs views of HMs too. He offered general practitioners (n=33) and healthcare workers (n=10) the opportunity to complete a questionnaire about Asian patients' use of HMs. The results revealed that HCPs awareness of Asian HMs was 'extremely low' and HCPs were unaware of their patients' use of HMs. As the research was conducted on a small Asian community in Glasgow the results are not representative of SAs in the UK; in addition, as the research was conducted in 1986 the results are now dated. Sandhu and Heinrich (2005) explored the knowledge and use of HMs amongst a Sikh Punjabi community in London, by conducting semi-structured interviews with 84 participants. They documented the use of numerous HMs by the research participants and uncovered how participants managed minor ailments. As this research was focused on a specific religious (Sikh) and cultural group (Punjabi) the results are not representative of SAs; the authors do highlight that there is an urgent need to investigate the use of HMs amongst other ethnic groups in the UK. The study by Pieroni and Torry (2007) focused specifically on Kashmiri, Gujarati, and English participants medical perception of five 'herbal drugs' (cinnamon, cloves, garlic, 27 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra ginger, and mint). A questionnaire was completed by 274 participants who were asked to state the perceived medicinal properties and uses of the products listed. They found a difference in traditional knowledge amongst the ethnic groups; whereby, Kashmiri participants had widespread knowledge of the herbal drugs listed while it was less prevalent amongst Gujarati and especially English participants. Pieroni et al. (2010) conducted interviews (n=37) and focus groups (n=42) with Bengalis in Bradford to explore their use of traditional HMs. They recorded approximately 150 herbal preparations recalled by participants, and identified that many of them were still commonly used in the UK. Pieroni et al. (2010) found that middle-aged and older participants were more accurately able to recall HMs than younger participants; moreover, younger generations seemed to prefer CWM over traditional HMs. The results of this research indicate that HMs are still commonly used by Bangladeshi migrant communities in the UK. The current research on SA communities' use of HMs in the UK is limited; but, it has provided a basis for conducting this research. Some of the concepts explored by other researchers will be further investigated in this study, to help gain a better understanding about the current use of HMs by SAs in the UK. 28 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.5 Methodology 2.5.1 Questionnaire Design A questionnaire to meet the aims and objectives of the SATMED project was designed; to explore the current use of HMs amongst SA diasporic communities in the UK. Several draft copies of the questionnaire were piloted; Malhotra and Birks (2006) refer to pilot studies as, ''testing the questionnaire on a small sample of respondents for the purpose of improving the questionnaire by identifying and eliminating potential problems.'' Amendments made to the questionnaire included: reducing the length of the survey without compromising the quality of the data, removing a question which used images of HMs which was ambiguous, and rewording some questions (Appendix 1). After which a more refined and tailored questionnaire was produced to meet the objectives of the research (Appendix 3). A participant information leaflet (PIL) was provided to participants to inform them about the purpose of the research (Appendix 4). Initially the questionnaire was designed for participants to complete themselves; however, after conducting a pilot study the researcher believed it was more appropriate to administer the questionnaire personally. Several reasons for changing the way the questionnaire was conducted included: incomplete questionnaires, participants dropping out part-way, illegible handwriting, and feedback from participants who stated the survey was too long to write answers to despite having great knowledge of HMs. To ensure no bias was introduced from the researcher when asking the questions, thorough training from Professor Mark Johnson was attained; the training enabled the researcher to develop skills to keep participants engaged and affirmed how to ask the questions. Although this process was time consuming for the researcher the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. Advantages of the researcher administering the questionnaires included: the chance to build rapport with the participants - gaining trust and better responses to questions, a higher response rate, more complete questionnaires returned, and clarification of questions therefore less invalid responses (Dornyei and Taguchi 2010). Furthermore, as the researcher was fluent in Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu it was easier to engage participants who could not understand, read or write English. A mixture of open and closed (quantitative and qualitative) questions were used in this survey. One of the reasons for using quantitative questions was so the data obtained could be statistically analysed; enabling the quantification of data and comparisons to be made. While the qualitative questions obtained richer, more in-depth knowledge of the individual participants' perception regarding the objectives of the study (Levin et al., 2008). The questionnaire took on average ten to twenty minutes to complete. 29 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.5.2 The Target Research Population The participant inclusion criteria for this research stated participants must be over eighteen years of age (so they could consent for their own participation without the need for parental consent), and from a South Asian (SA) background (i.e. Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi) (Office for National Statistics, 2012). There is no existing database which permits randomised or systematic identification of a suitable population of SA origin (i.e. the sampling frame); therefore, an opportunity sampling technique was used. For this reason there was no pre-defined target of gender or age group to survey. Malhotra and Birks (2006) say opportunity sampling involves, ''being in the right place at the right time.'' The sampling method used followed established practice in other similar studies whereby the target research population was directly approached in anticipation of recruiting more participants (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Pieroni et al., 2010). Participants were reassured that all responses would remain anonymous (as no personal identifiable data was taken), and confidential. All the responses were kept in the possession of the primary researcher with no unauthorised access. A unique aspect of this study was that it focused on SA populations as a whole; whereas, most other studies focused on single ethnic or religious groups (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Jennings, 2014; Pieroni et al., 2010). 2.5.3 Ethical Approval De Montfort University (DMU) ethical approval was obtained before the questionnaires were distributed (Appendix 1). The questionnaire and PIL (Appendix 3 & 4) were reviewed by the DMU ethics committee, who gave feedback and some minor suggestions. Instead of using the phrase 'side-effects' they recommended using a more neutral statement such as 'unwanted' or 'unexpected' effects. The ethics committee also commented on the length of the survey, which after the first pilot study was shortened; as some questions were removed or merged together. 2.5.4 Questionnaire Distribution In total two hundred questionnaires were conducted across several locations in Birmingham and Leicester (one hundred in each city); two cities the primary researcher knew well (Table 2-1). The Census statistics suggested that Birmingham and Leicester would provide a reliable base for the field work as 7% of the population of England are now of SA origin; hence, the data would have wider applicability (Office for National Statistics, 2012). 30 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Statistics revealed that over 30% of the residents in Birmingham are from an ethnic minority group. The SA communities of interest in Birmingham have increased from 17.9% in 2001 to 22.5% in 2011 (Office for National Statistics, 2012).The demographic profile of Leicester, in 2007, revealed that approximately 40% of Leicester's population were from an ethnic minority background (Leicester City Council, 2007). The 2011 Census suggests that the minority population of Leicester has risen to 54.9%, 35.8% of SA background (Office for National Statistics, 2012).

SPSS has multiple advantages over other analytical software including: the range of statistical techniques which enable exploration of relationships between variables (e.g. T-tests and analysis of variance test). In addition, significant differences between variables can be tested and cross-tabulations can also be created (Pallant, 2007). The software enables data to be coded; thus, allowing both quantitative and qualitative responses to be analysed. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to create the graphical representations. The number (n) of participants or responses will be referenced throughout the results. 31 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.6 Results and Discussion This section will summarise the results of the SATMED questionnaire. The survey was split into four segments: the first section explored participants' demographics, the second looked at the use of traditional herbal remedies, the third at the use of prescription medication, and finally the treatment of minor ailments. Although, two hundred surveys were conducted across several locations in Birmingham and Leicester, eight were discarded as they were either incomplete or the participants did not come under the SA inclusion criteria, leaving a total of one hundred and ninety two surveys for analysis. 2.6.1 Sample Description This section was designed to determine participants' age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and occupation. In addition, participants were asked where they currently lived, were born, and where their parents were born to establish migration patterns and links between their knowledge of herbal medicines (HMs) and their heritage. A total of 192 questionnaires were used in this analysis. Gender and Age Profile of Participants The sample was comprised of 69% (n=132) female and 31% (n=60) male participants. As an opportunity sampling technique was employed, there was no method of screening or selecting the research sample to ensure an equal number of female and male participants were selected. One of the reasons for having more female respondents was due to the locations where the research was conducted; in the community and day centres visited in both Birmingham and Leicester it was observed that there was always a disproportionately larger number of females in comparison to males."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'taxa': [{'scientific_name': 'Curcuma longa L.', 'medical_conditions': ['cancer'], 'medicinal_effects': ['antimicrobial', 'anti-inflammatory', 'antioxidant', 'anticancer', 'kill tumour cells']}, {'scientific_name': 'Allium sativum L.', 'medical_conditions': ['dyslipidaemia', 'high cholesterol', 'stroke', 'heart disease', 'infections'], 'medicinal_effects': ['antibacterial', 'anti-platelet', 'anti-hypertensive', 'reducing low density lipids and triglycerides']}, {'scientific_name': 'Eugenia caryophylatta Thunb.', 'medical_conditions': ['toothaches'], 'medicinal_effects': ['anaesthetic', 'analgesic', 'antiseptic', 'antimicrobial', 'anti-emetic', 'aid digestion']}, {'scientific_name': 'Azadirachta indica A.Juss.', 'medical_conditions': None, 'medicinal_effects': ['antibacterial', 'antifungal', 'anti-inflammatory', 'anti-diabetic', 'antipruritic', 'anti-cancer', 'blood purifying']}]}"}]}
