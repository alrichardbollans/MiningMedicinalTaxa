      "text": "We do not have to choose between unity and multiplicity ...you see, pure unity or pure multiplicity - when there is only totality or unity and when there is only multiplicity or disassociation - is a synonym of death....A culture is different from itself; language is different from itself; the person is different from itself. Once you take into account this inner and other difference then you pay attention to the other (Derrida, 1997: 13-14). Derrida rejected the criticism of his theory of deconstruction as being a negative concept and emphasised that it was a productive process, that used \"the tension between memory, fidelity, the preservation of something that has been given to us, and at the same time, heterogeneity, something absolutely new, and a break\" (Derrida, 1997: 6). For this study, deconstructing the concepts of naturalness, holistic health and safety from risk meant carefully examining the participants' remarks on these qualities of supplements to see how they unsettled the dominant interpretations about them as being concepts that 'everyone' understood in the same way (Jackson & Mazzei, 2012). It meant being alert to the wide spectrum of views that were expressed in the discussions with the participants, as well as paying attention to the nuances that were implied but less directly stated. It meant noticing that some participants implicitly engaged in their own form of deconstruction, offering both complementary and competing explanations about the qualities of supplements in the course of their remarks. It did not mean undermining or negating what any of them said or treating some remarks as insignificant, but opening up the ideas around the qualities of supplements to show how they were evolving. 53 Using deconstruction within the wider framework of Deleuze and Guattari's rhizomatic assemblage that underpins this study overall allows it to act as a force that diversifies the assemblage of actants. Rather than competing ideas participants put forward about naturalness, for example, being put aside as outliers because they were inconsistent with one another, all interpretations had their place among the heterogeneous components of the assemblage. This diversification resulted in an exponentially greater capacity for connections to be made between the components, which in turn could be seen to be changing the way that the supplement assemblage was spreading out in different directions as it evolved. According to Bearn (2000, 2013), the crucial difference between Derrida and Deleuze is that Derrida sees deconstruction within a framework of success or failure. Opening up to the 'other', according to Derrida (1997: 6), \"this newness, this novelty is a risk ... it is guaranteed by no previous rules.\" Deleuze, in contrast, moves right outside the framework of winning or losing in the 'game of existence' and \"the point of the game floats away, leaving us just playing\" (Bearn, 2013: 53-54). Using both Derrida and Deleuze to think about supplements, then, is a way of looking at supplements as ongoing health practices, comprised of multiple components, that are undertaken in the course of individual lives, not focused on any particular end point, and which are always in process, \"in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo\" (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987:26). This approach avoids deciding whether deconstructing the discourses around supplements 'succeeds' or not. Instead, it shows the variety of interpretations around the common discourses about supplements to be unique interconnections that individuals make between the many components in the assemblage, mobilizing them according to what they do in their everyday life, the \"plastic habits ... dynamics and ruptures ... that affect bodily states, modes of attention, and ways of experiencing time and space\" (Dewsbury, 2011: 149, 150). The chapter has three major sections which deconstruct in turn the discourses of naturalness, holistic health, and safety from risk. In each of the three sections I have firstly examined the participants' comments to show the way they unsettled the assumed meaning of each of these qualities and showed up the \"absent present...which has been ignored in an attempt to preserve the illusion of truth as a perfectly self-contained and self-sufficient present\" (Jackson and Mazzei, 2012: 18). I then look at the evolving assemblage of actants that surrounded the idea of supplements as natural, holistic and safe: the products themselves, what the participants said about them, what they said about their own background, relationships, attitudes and experiences of health and life, their reference to discourses in wider society, and their use of information. I show that there were both commonalities and differences in the way the 54 participants thought about the natural, holistic and safe qualities of their supplements, drawing from the past but moving and changing as the participants themselves moved on with their lives, being influenced by new experiences and new social discourses. To conclude, the chapter looks at the three assemblages as part of a greater and even more tangled assemblage where all these connections are intimately linked in shifting arrangements that are always changing, a process which Bearn (2013: 53) terms \"the liquid time of becoming.\" This resonated not only with the study participants as individuals who were striving to pursue a healthy life, but also with the idea of the life quest, where individuals evolve in themselves through the 'becomings' that take place on the journey. Nature and naturalness That supplements and herbal medicines are 'natural' is arguably the most dominant discourse around these products and one which formed a frequent topic in the discussions with the participants. Many of them expressed straightforward views that constructed natural products as being simpler and better for them. I just liked the more natural kind of things rather than getting too carried away with pills and potions. I like them to be a bit more natural. ... I went to a herbalist ... and they would recommend things if I had something wrong ... if you had a sore throat they would recommend this might actually be better for you rather than having something that's got chemicals in it. I guess if I was given the option I would rather something that was natural. (Johnny) Johnny here seems to assume that there is a standard meaning of what is natural and that the two of us who are discussing the issue share an understanding about the positive benefits that it brings to mind. Johnny is not unusual in contemporary times in the way he talks about naturalness, as others have also remarked (Devcich et al., 2007; Li & Chapman, 2012; Rozin et al., 2012; Rozin et al., 2004). Amos et al (2014: 268) suggest that labelling a product as natural evokes \"sentimental pastoral associations\" for consumers that they transfer to the product itself, crediting it with being free of contamination and offering health benefits. All kinds of products - fabrics, foods, construction materials - as well as supplements, draw on naturalness in promoting their benefits to consumers (Childs & Poryzees, 1998; Lahteenmaki, 2013; Rozin et al., 2004). The closer one looks at what is 'natural', however, the more it demonstrates Derrida's notion that there are \"tensions, contradictions, heterogeneity\" (1997: 9) within what appears on the surface to be a single understanding. Deconstructing the 'natural' reveals that it is deeply 55 imbued with complex economic, cultural, social and political currents (Pawson & Brooking, 2013), with many contested meanings, all of which depend to a greater or lesser extent on the contrast between nature and humanity (Kellert, 1993; Rozin et al., 2004; Soper, 1998; Van Koppen, 2000). Nature has never been a neutral, value-free concept (Kearns & Gesler, 1998); it has been associated with sacredness, beauty and peace, as well as fear and destruction. So while nature is beautiful and beneficent it is also terrifying (Kellert, 1993). Awe and worship of the natural environment are considered the most ancient form of religious belief (Shibley, 2011; Snodgrass & Tiedje, 2008). Many modern customs, too, both secular and religious, have their roots in ancient rites associated with natural features such as springs, hills and rocks (Gesler, 1996: 102; Strang, 2004: 111). Yet nature also brings horror and death through cyclones, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires and floods. So in spite of the positive associations that labelling of food products and supplements draws on, for example, nature has many layers of meaning that have differed across historical eras and varied between individuals according to their experience and attitudes to the world (Heintzman, 2009; Lee, 2010; Soper, 1995, 1998). Until relatively recently, mastering, and improving on nature was seen as a universal 'good' for the human race because it increased the chance of survival in an unpredictable world where no one, however wealthy or important, was exempt from sudden death through disease or the vagaries of natural events (Rozin et al., 2004). During the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, however, major advances in engineering, science and food safety saw these fears moderate as life became less uncertain (Stanziani, 2008). Longevity improved and confidence increased in \"Western models of progress\" (Soper, 1998: 5) which would improve on the natural world through science and technology. By the second half of the 20th century, however, it became clear that conquering nature was not an unalloyed good and that human disregard for the importance of the natural eco-system had created a range of disastrous consequences (Beck, 2000; Chapman et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2016; Meffe, 1992). Environmental and human disasters such as the dust bowl in the US in the 1930s (Romm, 2011), the Bhopal chemical explosion (Varma & Varma, 2005), and the nuclear accident at Chernobyl (Bouville et al., 2005; Moller & Mousseau, 2006) to name just a few, saw a realisation that exploiting and damaging the natural environment would ultimately rebound on humanity. More recently, the series of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2019), and the linking of extreme weather events to human-induced climate change rather than to exclusively natural causes (Mann et al., 2017; Stott et al., 2016), have added even more 56 compellingly to the acknowledgement that the natural environment needs to be respected and cared for and that damage done will eventually have to be addressed. There has been a widespread societal change in attitudes to environmental protection, encompassing several strands of interwoven ideas. Firstly, that natural resources need to be preserved for sustainable use for future generations (Hansen et al., 2013; Holden et al., 2014); secondly, that human health and global environmental health are intimately linked (Rabinowitz & Conti, 2013; Stephenson et al., 2013) and thirdly, that the natural environment and non-human species have an intrinsic value that humans have a moral responsibility to preserve (Batavia & Nelson, 2017; Chan et al., 2016; Piccolo, 2017). These dominant, though not uncontested, social discourses appear to underpin the attitude to nature and natural things as pure, simple and superior to the non-natural (Amos, 2014; Li & Chapman, 2012; Rozin et al., 2012). One particular way that preference for natural things manifests itself is in relation to substances that are ingested as food, drink and medicines (Aprile et al., 2016; Li & Chapman, 2012; Saher et al., 2006; Thompson, 2003). Johnny, in the excerpt above, demonstrates this attitude in his comments, yet he also implicitly acknowledges that there are gradations within naturalness. He does not explain, for example, what he means by 'a bit more natural' and he constructs the herbalist's products as different from 'pills and potions' because they do not have 'chemicals' even though he may well take them, too, in the form of pills or potions. Many participants also seemed to see it as self-evident that 'natural products' and pharmaceuticals were on separate sides of a divide in medicinal products and had their own idea of where the boundary between them should be drawn. Prescribed medicines, constructed as 'drugs' were on the other side of that boundary for most of them and not thought of as natural products: Certainly with the things I use for my family, I think I'm doing the right thing. It's quite empowering in a way. Because it's shown to be natural you feel like you're doing something - you're not pumping drugs into your body. (Vonnie) It is noticeable that Vonnie's use of the expression 'pumping drugs' calls to mind syringes and hospitals, which emphasise the sharp contrast she is making between the two constructs; one draws on the idea of treating oneself with a simple product from nature, while the other draws on concepts of interventionist medicine over which the individual has limited control. Olivia 57 brought this out even more directly in her account of treating her child's eczema with a paste made from chickweed (Stellaria media) from her own garden: In a couple of days it had gone. You know, nothing else - we were trying all those remedies - we had gone to get those lipid creams, steroid stuff and then it would go and then come back. With this, a few days - a week and it was gone until maybe the next season and we would try it again. We did that a few seasons and it never came back again. (Olivia) Olivia makes her point by pointing to the clear contrast between the (natural) home-made herbal remedy and the (non-natural) 'steroid stuff' of the prescribed medicines. Yet a large number of prescription drugs are either directly plant-based or a chemically modified version of compounds from plants, so that the difference between a natural health product and a pharmaceutical medicine can be very small (Holt & MacDonald, 2008: 22-23). A number of participants, however, without any prompting, commented on the indeterminate line between what was natural and what was not. I did not specifically ask them to articulate what they meant by 'natural' but it is possible that participating in the study led them to think more critically about their practices than before. Whether or not this was the case, they engaged in their own form of deconstruction, reflecting on the competing meanings that existed, including in their own practices. How natural is 'natural'? Participants' comments ranged from the sceptical to the pragmatic and the (relatively) idealistic. Some of them acknowledged that thinking of supplements as natural required a certain amount of willing suspension of disbelief, an awareness that the 'natural' label on a product was not something that stood up to investigation and could simply be a marketing tool. Iris, for example, indicated that she chose not to think too deeply about the substances she took which were \"meant to be all natural but it's in a powder so you have to wonder how natural that is\". Bryony shared Iris's scepticism about the products available for sale. She noted that though she bought so-called 'natural medicines' for herself and her family, they were usually powdered extracts in capsules bought from a shop, and quite possibly made in a factory by the same company that made pharmaceuticals: Just because it is on a shelf and is labelled as natural doesn't mean it doesn't have an effect on your whole body balance. ...natural to me would be if I went and picked 58 something and I could see all the bits of dried leaves and twigs and dried berries and made some kind of something out of it and drink it. To me that's natural. (Bryony) However, she acknowledged that this artisan ideal was unrealistic for her and most others, as they would have neither the ingredients nor the desire to formulate their own products. Her compromise was to get products that were \"just as close to natural as I can get in the form of medicine that you get from a health food store or from a pharmacy.\" As Bryony indicates here, if the original substances are going to be sold in shops, they need to be packaged into a stable format that can be shipped to different destinations and still retain their active properties, but in doing so they lose their completely 'natural' qualities. Almost all participants relied on commercially sold products and even for those few who made some of their own, it was only as a complement to other products that they bought. The standardisation needed to produce and market herbal medicines on a large scale so that they are consistently the same quality is another contested area which unsettles the idea of 'true' naturalness. The commercial marketing of supplements has been seen as distancing herbal traditions from their craft-based origins in order to turn them into a globalised industry. Some have interpreted standardisation as being politically and economically motivated by \"seemingly inevitable biomedical hegemony\" (Singer & Fisher, 2007: 25) that wants to force traditional healing modalities to \"play the evidence game\" (Barry, 2006: 2650) and be brought within the \"structurally dominant scientific paradigm\" (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003: 321). The contrasting view is that 'natural' (that is, alternative) and orthodox medical approaches have much to offer each other and that they can and should work together for mutual benefit. Wahlberg (2008) for example, supports the standardisation of plant extracts as being an avenue through which they may be accepted as potential treatments available either within orthodox medicine or as an additional support to what has been prescribed. One of the pharmacist participants voiced a similar view; his experience was that an integrated approach provided a greater range of options and ultimately benefited his customers: [the customer] would come with a prescription and say, well I don't know about this but anyway I was sort of thinking about another alternative, what is there? And so you would still support the doctor who prescribed it but on the other hand you could say, well there are other options, maybe as a helper for what you have been given ...So in a sense it helps that person. Or they will come in and say I've heard that ginko biloba is really good for the brain, what do you think about that? (Lou) 59 Participants generally seemed to agree in principle with this practical, open approach."
