      "text": "One of the most important recasts that I have described has been the challenging of an evolutionary anthropology, which had its heyday in the 19th century, by a social and cultural anthropology in the early 20th century. The effect of this challenge was to flatten racist civilisational hierarchies through an insistence that we are all human subjects, regardless of cultural, social or geographical origin. We may well ascribe to different worldviews, adopt different cultural practices in efforts to, for example, heal ourselves, or enjoy different forms of food, but we are nonetheless all subjects whose practices are informed by worldviews, cultural values and social norms, as different as they may be. Indeed, it is exactly in its effort to map out these different worldviews, collective cognitive frameworks, and social norms that anthropology and sociology have reinforced this universally human subject. If anything, I would argue that Vietnamese regulators, herbal practitioners, doctors and community workers are well 'ahead' of their British counterparts when it comes to modernising, rationalising and industrialising the production, practice and use of herbal medicine. While distinctions between western and Vietnamese medicine certainly persist to this day, there has been a consistent call to \"unify\" and \"collaborate\" - reflected in the ways in which public health delivery is organised. Vietnamese chemists, botanists and pharmacologists have been travelling the countryside since the 1960s to collect folk remedies, and to collaborate with apprentice-trained practitioners in identifying medicinal plants and in modernising traditional remedies. In the United Kingdom, the Ethnomedica-research group with a similar mandate was set up as recently as 1999. Moreover, while practices of self-regulation by British herbalists date back to the mid 19th century, it was not until 2001 that a Herbal Medicine Working Group was set up to investigate the possibility of statutory recognition for herbal practitioners. In Vietnam, as we saw, traditional herbal practitioners have been actively recruited into the public health delivery system since the late 1950s. Now, to suggest that Vietnamese herbal practitioners, scientists and government officials have been somehow duped into modernising, rationalising and industrialising their herbal medicines by a hegemony of 'western rationalities' is in my view to completely miss the point, if not outright condescending. As already emphasised, whether herbal medicine in Vietnam is better or worse off following six decades of modernising, rationalising and industrialising or whether it could have been done better are questions that cannot be concluded on the basis of my analysis. What I can say without hesitation is that these 233 processes have been robustly and actively pursued by herbalists, doctors and government officials alike - not without disagreement or debate, but pursued nonetheless as described in my analysis. Histories of the present and their limitations In chapter 2, I made a point of distinguishing a history of the present approach to investigating the revival of herbal medicine in Vietnam and the United Kingdom from those of a sociology of health and illness, a sociology of professions, and a sociology of knowledge. In doing so, I wanted to emphasise that I would be asking a different type of question than would have been posed had I chosen one of these latter approaches. I also argued that the critical contribution my study would make would be one of troubling self-evidences and historicising practices rather than exposing shams or identifying shortcomings. As a direct consequence, there are of course many aspects of traditional herbal medicine in these two countries that have not been covered in the preceding chapters. I have not, for example, provided a detailed analysis of the regulatory and policy frameworks and processes within which herbal medicine has been mobilised in each of the countries. This would have entailed mapping out and following the processes of policy formulation, implementation and review. I could have spent many more hours speaking to Ministry of Health officials, and sifting through many more pages of legislation and policy proposals than I have. I could also have written an entire dissertation on recent efforts to professionalise and organise local district level associations of traditional practitioners in Vietnam or on ongoing efforts to unify herbal practitioners (whether Western, Chinese, Tibetan or Ayurvedic) in the United Kingdom under one umbrella professional association. Neither can I claim to be at this time an erudite expert in the teachings and texts of either Sino-Vietnamese medicine or western herbal medicine. I could certainly have committed myself to a much more in-depth immersion in the conceptual universes of Vietnamese and British herbal medicine and the medical texts upon which they have been built up. This would have entailed many more exchanges with herbal practitioners, and perhaps even concerted efforts to begin training myself in the art of herbalism. In the same way, I could also have concentrated my entire fieldwork on the phytochemical laboratories in which pharmacological work to understand the workings of herbal medicines and pharmaceutical work to improve extraction and production procedures are taking place. I could have followed the trials, errors and successes of the scientists and herbalists in the laboratories in 234 a much more detailed way, attempting to understand how they arrive at the findings they do, errors made along the way, and new challenges arising from their work. And finally, without having carried out ethnographic field observations and interviews I have of course not been able to provide a \"patient's eye view\" of herbal medicine use, its cultural meanings, the innovative ways in which people use herbal medicine in their day-to-day healthcare activities, or the functions it fulfils in generating individual coping strategies. It would have been fascinating, for example, to have identified a rural village in Vietnam where the \"Doctor at Home\" programme has been introduced and spent time looking at the everyday ways in which such programmes are adopted and/or rejected. Similarly I have not spent sufficient time with herbal practitioners in their practices observing the ways in which they interact with their patients, the challenges they face when working with biomedical doctors, or the microphysics of the power relationships that are emerging out of ongoing professionalisation efforts, to be able to provide a \"practitioner's view\" on herbal medicine in the two countries in question. With so much happening in terms of the professionalisation of British herbal medicine, it would undoubtedly have been rewarding to spend more time delving into the practicalities of this process, as well as the ways in which it is being received and debated. As I have already highlighted, the point to be made is that each of these limitations that have arisen on the back of the methodological choices I made to begin with, suggest fields of study which merit monographs in themselves - and indeed there are plenty of researchers who in fact are carrying out such studies. As such, a more pertinent point to reflect on when discussing the limitations of my approach regards the analytical findings and conclusions that I have summarised above. What is it that my study can tell us about British and Vietnamese herbal medicine and just as importantly what is it unable to conclude? My aim has been to establish the contours of the conditions of possibility that can help us to explain ongoing efforts to mobilise and revive British and Vietnamese herbal medicine. How have these efforts become possible? At the same time, I have also aimed to demonstrate that these efforts inevitably entail liabilities as well, and that one of the self-reflexive components of these efforts has been exactly to try and offset some of these liabilities by insisting on humanised and holistic processes of modernisation. This is a very different critical task than that which is perhaps characteristic of the sub-disciplines of medical anthropology and medical sociology, which have often explicitly worked to 235 demonstrate the shortcomings of a particular form of medicine (usually biomedicine) while advocating more 'holistic' or 'socio-culturally grounded' forms of medical intervention. The links between medical sociology and medical activism, as I have noted, are intimate. Nevertheless, it is of course standard fare to be asked of and held accountable for the normative contributions that academic endeavours like this current study deliver. And to answer this, I would highlight the conceptual moves proposed in the preceding chapters much more than any kind of practical reforms or improvements of regulatory or healing interventions that concern British and Vietnamese herbal medicine. As I demonstrated in the beginning of this dissertation, incommensurability between the modern and the traditional, biomedicine and alternative medicine, or holism and reductionism have permeated much of the research and policy work done in this field. If anything, this study has shown that, first of all, incommensurability becomes increasingly difficult to discern the further you delve into the microphysics of traditional herbal medicine. And, second of all, to the extent that there are incommensurabilities, these are increasingly being tackled and addressed as technical hurdles to be overcome. Perhaps this point would not have been as accentuated as it has been in my study had I chosen crystallography in the United Kingdom and traditional healing in Vietnam as my empirical sites rather than herbal medicine, or had I chosen to seek out those 'dissident' voices who resist all efforts to \"combine\" modern and traditional medicine in Vietnam, or to \"professionalise\" herbal medicine in the UK. Nevertheless, it should certainly be clear from my analysis that that which is celebrated as 'holistic' and 'human' has objectifying effects in the same way that a 'reductionist' and 'mechanistic' biomedicine is seen to have objectifying effects. And similarly, while traditional and alternative medicine are often highlighted for their subject-centred approaches to healing, biomedicine and the various theories of life that it encompasses without question also have subjectifying effects. And so, while one of the crucial limitations of a history of the present is its inability to provide concrete and stable proposals for reforming, improving or mainstreaming that which it studies (not least because any such proposals would be instantly open to genealogical and archaeological scrutiny), one of its most important contributions is the kind of 'attitude' that it brings to the critical task. It is not about breaking down or exposing the insidious effects of various power-knowledge constellations and the ontologies they engender, rather it is to bring a certain humility and deference to these assemblages, 236 whether they derive from a 'hegemonic' biomedicine or a 'subjugated' alternative medicine. Deference, because these assemblages of power-knowledge relations will always have their side effects. 237 References Ackerknecht, E.
