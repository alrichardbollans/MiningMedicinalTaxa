      "text": "Thisis unfortunate, since much of the poisoning occurs inthe early spring before plants come into flower.Several toxic alkaloids have been isolated fromlarkspurs, the most important being delphinine.Toxicity varies from one species to the next, with theage of the plant, with the part ingested, and with thekind and vigor of the animal involved. Symptoms arealso variable. Livestock suffer from falling, kicking,severe constipation, vomiting, bloating, and paralysisof the respiratory centers. Most cases of poisoninginvolve cattle that have been put out to pasture beforeit is ready, so that the animals have little to eat otherthan young larkspur plants.FALSE HELLEBOREVeratrum californicum, a native member of the lilyfamily, is found in mountain meadows, often on wettersites. The robust plants have broad leaves withprominent veins and branched clusters of dull whiteflowers. The toxic principles are alkaloids that mayoccur singly or in combination with other classes oftoxins. Poisoning in humans is rare and it involvesgastrointestinal distress with severe vomiting anddiarrhea. There is also impairment of motor functions.Cardiovascular involvement is typical, with theheartbeat being noticeably slowed.Toxicity in pregnant ewes is dramatic. If they feed onfalse hellebore, the effect of the veratrum alkaloidson embryological development is severe and leads toa malformation in lambs called \"monkey-face\" or\"cyclops.\" The face is shortened, the forehead and jawprotrude, the nose is reduced so that the face isflattened. In cycloptic animals, there may be a singlecentral eye, two eyeballs in the same socket, or twoeyes partially fused.OLEANDERNerium oleander, a Mediterranean shrub, is a favoriteornamental in many of the warmer parts of the UnitedStates, because of its attractive flowers andpenetrating fragrance. It was once believed that theheavy fumes were, in fact, toxic if allowed to-158-accumulate in a closed, poorly ventilated room. Whilethis particular story has no basis, oleander's generalreputation for toxicity is well-founded. Cattle andhumans have both been killed by this plant. Childrenhave been poisoned by eating the leaves and bysucking nectar from the flowers. Cases of poisoningfrom eating meat that had been skewered on oleanderstems are also in the literature.All parts of the plant are poisonous. Several cardiacglycosides are present. Symptoms of toxicity inhumans include dizziness, drowsiness, irregular andweak heart-beat, coma, and death. Smoke fromburning plants is also dangerous.POISON HEMLOCKThe carrot family (Umbelliferae) is an excellentexample of a common and easily recognizable plantfamily that contains both toxic and edible plants. Mostof them vaguely look like, smell like, and even tastelike carrots. The species are difficult to tell from oneanother. Most of the botanical features reside inmicroscopic features of the fruits. It is mistakenidentity that leads most people to eat the poisonhemlock (Conium maculatum), thinking that it isperhaps a wild carrot of some sort. Plants are commonroadside weeds over much of the United States. Theyhave delicate, fern-like foliage and white flowerclusters. The best diagnostic feature is purpleblotching on the stems and leaf stalks.Poison hemlock contains a series of nicotine-likealkaloids, the best known of them being coniine.Alkaloid concentration is highest in the seeds andlowest in the roots. Their effect is on the centralnervous system. The victim experiences progressivedepression of vital functions. The tips of the fingersand toes become insensitive; movement of the armsand legs is then impaired. They are finally paralyzed.The heart is weakened and slowed. Death comes asthe result of paralysis of the diaphragm andsubsequent respiratory failure.Circumstantial evidence suggests that one of poisonhemlock's most famous victims was Socrates. Thereremains some uncertainty as to the identity of thehemlock used in ancient Greece to dispatch enemiesof the state, but the symptoms reported by Plato inPhaedo are consistent with much of what we knowabout the plant. \"The boy went out, and after spending a long time,came in with the man who was to give the poisoncarrying it ground ready in a cup. Socrates caughtsight of the man and said, 'Here, my good man, youknow about these things; what must I do? 'Just drink it,' he said, 'and walk about till your legsget heavy, then lie down. In that way the drug will actof itself.'... he put the cup to his lips and, quite easy andcontented, drank it up.He walked about, and when he said that his legs werefeeling heavy, he lay down on his back, as the mantold him to do; at the same time the one who gavehim the potion felt him, and after a while examinedhis feet and legs; then pinching a foot hard, he askedif he felt anything; he said no.After this, again, he pressed the shins; and, movingup like this, he showed us that he was growing coldand stiff. Again, he felt him, and told us that when itcame to his heart, he would be gone. Already the coldhad come nearly as far as the abdomen, whenSocrates threw off the covering from his face - for hehad covered it over - and said, the last words uttered,'Criton,' he said, 'we owe a cock to Asclepios; pay itwithout fail.'... after a little time, he stirred, and the manuncovered him, and his eyes were still. Criton, seeingthis, closed the mouth and eyelids.This was the end of our comrade...\"[Phaedo, Plato]It has been suggested, however, that Plato knowinglyomitted some of the more unpleasant aspects of whatoccurred in an attempt to make the death of Socratesseem more dignified and heroic.WATER HEMLOCKIf we had to select the most violently poisonous plantin North America, it would probably be water hemlock.The various species of Cicuta occur over much of thecontinent. Their most unmistakable diagnostic featureis found in the root-like stems, at or below the surfaceof the ground. When cut lengthwise, the rootstocksreveal cross-partitioning that divides them into smallcompartments. This is the most toxic part of the plant.One rootstock is sufficient to kill any large animal,including humans.The toxic principle is cicutoxin, an unsaturatedalcohol. It is a violent convulsant to the centralnervous system. Symptoms appear within 15 minutesto one hour after ingestion. At first, there is excessivesalivation, followed by tremors and convulsions. Theseizures alternate with periods of relaxation. Thetetanic convulsions become more frequent and moreviolent. In many victims there is an uncontrollablechewing movement that makes it difficult toadminister treatment. The tongue may be shreddedand teeth forced from their sockets. The poisoning isso traumatic in humans, that survivors often have norecollection of the event.Here is perhaps the earliest account in English ofwater hemlock poisoning. \"When about the end of March, 1670, the cattle werebeing led from the village to water at the spring, intreading the river banks they exposed the roots of thisCicuta [water hemlock], whose stems and leaf budswere now coming forth. A that time two boys and sixgirls, a little before noon, ran out of the spring and themeadow through which the river flows, and seeing aroot and thinking that it was a golden parsnip, notthrough the bidding of any evil appetite, but at thebehest of wayward frolicsomeness, ate greedily of it,and certain of the girls among them commended theroot to the others for its sweetness and pleasantness,wherefore the boys, especially, ate quite abundantlyof it and joyfully hastened home; and one the girlstearfully complained to her mother that she had beensupplied too meagerly by her comrades, with the root.Jacob Maeder, a boy of six years, possessed of whitelocks, and delicate though active, returned homehappy and smiling, as if things had gone well. A littlewhile afterwards he complained of pain in hisabdomen, and scarcely uttering a word, fell prostrateon the ground, and urinated with great violence to the-159-heighth of a man. Presently he was a terrible sight tosee, being seized with convulsions, with the loss of allhis senses. His mouth was shut most tightly so that itcould not be opened by any means. He grated histeeth; he twisted his eyes about strangely and bloodflowed from his ears.... He frequently hiccupped; attimes he seemed to be about to vomit, but he couldforce nothing from his mouth, which was most tightlyclosed. He tossed his limbs about marvelously andtwisted them; frequently his head was drawnbackward and his whole back was curved in the forma bow, so that a small child could have crept beneathhim the space between his back and the bed withouttouching him.When the convulsions ceased momentarily, heimplored the assistance of his mother. Presently,when they returned with equal violence, he could bearoused by no pinching, by not talking, or by no othermeans, until his strength failed and he grew pale; andwhen a hand was placed on his breast he breathed hislast.These symptoms continued scarcely beyond a halfhour. After his death, his abdomen and face swelledwithout lividness except that a little was noticeableabout the eyes. From the mouth of the corpse even tothe hour of his burial green froth flowed veryabundantly, and although it was wiped awayfrequently by his grieving father, nevertheless newfroth soon took its place.DUMBCANEThis popular ornamental (Dieffenbachia picta), nativeto the American tropics, may well be the most toxicmember of the philodendron or aroid family(Araceae). The traditional explanation of toxicity inthis group is relatively straightforward -- microscopic,needle-like crystals of calcium oxalate (raphides)become imbedded in the soft tissues of the mouth andthroat. The result is an intense burning sensation,abundant salivation, and a swelling of the lips, tongue,and mouth. There may be impairment of breathingand swallowing. Speech may become unintelligible orlost; hence the common name of the plant. There mayalso be corrosive effects on the esophagus andstomach. Sap can be very irritating to the eyes, aswell.In recent years, the role calcium oxalate in dumbcanetoxicity has been increasingly questioned. One recentstudy suggests that the raphides do not play a majorrole in the toxic effects of Dieffenbachia. Variousresearchers have implicated a proteolytic enzyme,histamines, and kinins.MISTLETOEMistletoes are parasitic shrubs that live on woodyplants, especially oaks. The European mistletoe[Viscum spp.] has a long history of medicinal uses,including to induce abortions. It is known in NorthAmerica only from introductions in California. TheAmerican mistletoe [Phoradendron spp.] has enjoyeda reputation for being highly poisonous, with only oneor two berries or leaves supposedly being fatal.Extracts from it have been used in herbal teas and itsleaves and berries incorporated into Christmasdecorations.Recent studies demonstrate that mistletoe toxicity hasbeen overstated. Ingestion of 1 to 3 berries or leavesappears unlikely to produce adverse reactions.However, herbal tea preparations do put a person atrisk and symptoms of poisoning may be severe.POINSETTIAEuphorbia pulcherrima, the poinsettia, is named afterJoel Poinsett, an American ambassador to Mexico inthe 19th century. It is one of this country's mostpopular ornamentals. Because literally millions ofthem are raised each year, especially at the Christmasseason, the question arises as to the plant's toxicity.It is widely held that the milky latex in the plant cancause irritation to the eyes and blistering of the skin.Ingestion of any portion is commonly thought toproduce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, loss ofconsciousness, and even death. As with mistletoe, it now appears that the poisonousproperties of the poinsettia have been exaggerated.While many standard references on toxic plants havemore or less the same litany of deleterious effects,documentation has been meager. The only fatalitycited appears to be that of a two-year-old child inHawaii who died in 1919 after eating a single leaf. Thecase is now considered hearsay. Recent studiessuggest that the latex has a mildly irritating effect onthe skin of laboratory rabbits and that it also inducesphotosensitivity. Rats fed 25 gm/kg body weight of apoinsettia suspension showed no significant toxiceffects. Assuming a 50 lb child would react similarly,he or she would have to consume 500-600 leaves tosurpass that experimental dose.ERGOTI want to end this survey of toxic plants with the ergotfungus because it provides such a fine example of aplant that is toxic, one that has important medicinaluses, and is also well known for its psychoactiveproperties. The focus in this section will be on itspoisonous aspect. For thousands of years we havesuffered from a debilitating disease known as St.Antony's Fire or Ignis Sacre. Its victims werehorribly disfigured because of the loss of ears,portions of the nose, fingers, toes, hands, feet, oreven the lower portions of arms and legs.Domesticated animals were similarly poisoned. Forcenturies the cause was assumed to be evil spirits oreven God's punishment for wickedness.We now know that these symptoms are caused byalkaloids produced by the ergot fungus (Clavicepspurpurea and other species). Poisoning occurs whenwe consume contaminated food, often bread madefrom a cereal host of the fungus. The alkaloids causeconstriction of blood vessels, leading to the death oftissue and loss of body parts. Extremities of the bodyare the most likely targets because they are mostdistant from the heart. This syndrome of poisoning,known as chronic ergotism, occurs when the victimconsumes relatively small amounts of the ergotalkaloids over a long period of time. If the local milleris really sloppy and large doses of toxin enter thebody, the effect is not on the circulatory system, buton the central nervous system. The result isconvulsive ergotism, which produces a syndrome ofbizarre behavior that mimics mental illness. I will tellyou more about that subject when we get to medicinalplants.-160-POISONOUS PLANTS OF NORTH AMERICAScientific Name [Common Name] Toxic Part Toxic Principle.
