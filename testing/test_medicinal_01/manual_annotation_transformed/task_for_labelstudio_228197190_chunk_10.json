      "text": "The 45% (n=86) of participants who said they did not take any prescription medication were asked to move on to question 13 as the following questions were specifically for those who did take prescription medication. The following questions in this section represent the responses for 106 participants who took prescription medication. Figure 2-22 illustrates the age profile of participants who took regular prescribed medication; it identifies that more than half (n=57) of the 106 participants who took prescribed medication were in the 61 years plus age group. Despite this, participants from all of the other age groups also took prescription medicines. Participants were asked to list their medication, if they did not want to disclose this information they were asked to move on to the next question.

Table 2-7 summarises the medical conditions and medicines listed by participants. The results revealed that participants were taking medication for a vast range of health conditions; the most common conditions mentioned were hypertension (n=47), diabetes (n=36), and high cholesterol (n=25). Other common health problems included thyroid disorders, asthma, and allergies. The types of CWM taken can be categorised by age groups; medicines such as the contraceptive pill, acne treatments, and iron supplements were common in younger females (aged less than 20 to 30 years). The few young males who said they took regular prescribed medication used inhalers for asthma. Medicines for arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions were generally mentioned by the latter half of the middle aged group (51-60 years) and elderly age group (61 years plus). Vitamins, topical preparations for skin conditions, thyroid disorder medication, and asthma treatments were mentioned by both genders and all age ranges.

The simultaneous use of HMs and CWM can have serious consequences; by asking participants what HMs and prescription medicines they took, the information could be used to identify any potential interactions. At the time of conducting the surveys the researcher 63 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra did not intend on identifying interactions and making participants aware; there was a disclaimer to inform participants to speak to their HCPs if they had any queries about their medication, which the DMU ethics committee advised the researcher to include. By looking at the list of CWM and HMs participants consumed, a range of adverse effects and potential interactions can be identified. Fugh-Berman (2000) says, ''concurrent use of herbs may mimic, magnify, or oppose the effect of drugs.'' Williamson et al. (2013) identifies an interaction when the effect of a drug is changed by the presence of another substance; this includes herbal medicines and food. HMs can alter the drugs pharmacokinetics by affecting the drugs absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. Cytochrome (CYP) P450 are a group of enzymes which metabolise a variety of substrates and have an important role in drug metabolism; the rate of enzyme activity can be affected by numerous herbal products. Some products may increase the rate of metabolism (enzyme inducers), rendering the drug ineffective at sub-therapeutic levels if metabolised too fast; alternatively if the drug is metabolised slower than anticipated, it can accumulate and cause toxicity. Tovar and Petzel (2009) claim, ''Garlic is safe when used in dietary amounts''; however, consumption at higher doses and stronger concentrations for medicinal purposes may be associated with underlying risks especially if used simultaneously with other drugs. Garlic has an enzyme inducing effect; therefore, it can reduce the effectiveness of drugs metabolised by CYP 3A4 (Spurgeon, 2000; Foster et al., 2001). Ponnusankar et al. (2011) investigated the effects of Triphala, a popular Ayurvedic mixture with multiple health benefits, on the CYP 450 enzyme; they found the three components of Triphala (amla, beleric and harad) caused inhibition of the enzyme; thus, reducing drug metabolism. Other interactions can be caused by HMs if they affect the drugs pharmacodynamics by imitating or inhibiting a drugs mode of action (Chavez et al., 2006). One of the most frequently mentioned herbal ingredients was ginger, cited 179 times during the surveys. Its use as an anti-emetic, digestive aid, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and for coughs and colds was commonly identified by participants. Ginger can have hypoglycaemic effects; hence, if consumed with other anti-diabetic medicines the risks associated with low blood glucose (BG) levels may be fatal (Newall et al., 1996). Fenugreek, karela, garlic, turmeric, tulsi and aloe vera were also identified by participants as being used in diabetes to lower BG. Researchers who have explored the hypoglycaemic properties of fenugreek have found it to be a very powerful anti-diabetic agent due to the actives: gonelline, nicotinic acid and coumarin found in the defatted portion of the seed (Pandey et al., 2011). A significant reduction in BG levels caused by taking HMs could lead to poor diabetic control, interactions with medication, and serious health risks for the patient (Sethi et al., 2004). 64 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Cloves have been traditionally used as digestive aids and for toothache, due to their carminative and analgesic effects. With a high eugonel content, which inhibits platelet aggregation, interactions between conventional anti-platelets (aspirin and clopidogrel) and anti-coagulants (warfarin) have been identified (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). This is also true for many other herbals including: garlic, ginger, hing, fenugreek and turmeric which can increase blood clotting time (Newall et al., 1996; Spurgeon, 2000). People are at an increased risk of haemorrhage due to the dual blood thinning effect of combining CWM with HMs (Heck et al., 2005). Liquorice was often used by participants to treat coughs and upper respiratory tract congestion. Large quantities and long term ingestion has been associated with hypokalaemia and hypertension (Lin et al., 2003; Chevallier, 2007). Due to its stimulant and fluid retention properties liquorice has been known to increase blood pressure, rendering anti-hypertensive medicines less effective (Williamson et al., 2013). If taken with prescription diuretics (e.g. Bendroflumethiazide or Furosemide), which are known to be associated with hypokalaemia, potassium levels may fall below optimum levels. Hypokalaemia is usually asymptomatic so people may not be aware of the consequences; however, sometimes it may present as symptoms of weakness, muscle cramp, constipation and palpitations (Lederer and Batuman, 2014). Without the correct knowledge, this may not be identified or treated appropriately. The incidence of interaction with CWM and HMs is not fully known; Williamson et al. (2013) highlight that despite this many HCPs openly admit they lack knowledge in this area. The insufficient reporting of interactions and adverse effects may be due to inadequate training or a lack of knowledge of how to report them. Interactions between HMs and CWM may exist; but, if people do not tell their doctors and pharmacists they will not be able to intervene. Alternatively, people may not be aware there is an interaction or adverse effect as they do not always present with symptoms. 65 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 11: Do you tell your (a) doctor and (b) pharmacist what herbal remedies you use? Figure 2-23 illustrates the responses of whether or not the participants who took regular prescribed medication told their doctor and/or pharmacist about their use of HMs. Of the 106 participants who did take regular prescribed medication, 13% of participants (n=14) did not consume any HMs, so they answered 'not applicable'. Just 18% of participants (n=19) said they did tell their doctor, and only 5% (n=5) told their pharmacist about herbal remedies they took alongside their prescription medicines. A significant proportion of participants (69%, n=73) revealed they did not tell their doctor and even more (82%, n=87) declared they did not tell their pharmacist. Similar findings were illustrated by a study conducted by Bhopal (1986a), who found participants did not tell their doctor about herbal remedies as they felt it was a separate matter. Results from the Ipsos MORI report (2008) revealed that 20% of respondents in their survey did not think there was any need to inform their general practitioner (GP) about HMs they used; while 56% felt it was important to tell their GP. Table 2-8 summarises the reasons why participants in this study did not tell their doctor or pharmacist about their use of HMs. 0102030405060708090Doctor PharmacistNumber of participantsDo Participants Tell Their Doctor or Pharmacist About Their Use of Herbal Medicines?YesNoNot applicableFigure 2-23 Do Participants Tell Their Doctor or Pharmacist about Their Use of Herbal Medicines? 66 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 2-8 Participants Reasons for Not Telling Healthcare Professionals about Their Personal Use of Herbal Medicines Participant Number: Reasons For Not Telling Healthcare Professionals About Personal Use of Herbal Medicines: 67 ''I do not tell the doctor about herbal medicines as doctors do not believe you if you tell them they are good.'' 73 ''I do not tell the doctor or pharmacist about herbal remedies as the doctor says why are you coming to us if you want to try different medicines.'' 77 ''I do not tell the doctor about herbal remedies taken as he is not bothered.'' 105 ''My doctor has said she would not advise mixing herbal medicines.'' 109 ''I do not tell my pharmacist as I never see one.'' 111 \"I do not tell the GP about herbal medicines I take as he might say do not take it.\" 113 ''The doctors do not believe in herbal remedies so why should I tell them what I use!'' 117 ''Doctor refuses the use of herbal medicines and says do not take them without our guidance.'' 124 ''Too scared to tell the doctor about any herbal medicines taken.'' 138 ''I rarely get to see my GP and do not ever see or speak to a pharmacist when I go to collect my medicines.'' 156 ''I do not tell my doctor or pharmacist about herbal medicines used as they do not recommend it.'' Several crucial reasons for not telling the doctor or pharmacist about personal use of HMs were identified. From the participants' responses (Table 2-8) it appears that participants thought HCPs lacked interest in HMs and were not concerned if they were consumed, as stated by participants 67, 77, and 113. If HCPs are not interested in their patients' use of HMs, then patients will feel reluctant to share this information with them (Staines, 2011). HCPs need to be broad-minded and approachable so that patients feel comfortable talking to them about their use of HMs (Newall et al., 1996; Vickers, 2000). Participants in this study claimed they would be advised to stop using HMs if they told their HCPs, as exemplified by the comments from participants 73, 117, and 156. An example of how taking HMs can affect patients' compliance with CWM and why HCPs may tell patients not to take HMs was demonstrated by Vohra (2015) who detailed the conversation between a pharmacist and a SA patient during a Medicines Use Review (MUR). During the MUR the patient explained to the pharmacist that he wanted to stop taking his antidepressant as he was taking a traditional Ayurvedic remedy instead; the pharmacist said, 'Conventional medicine has been clinically trialled and is proven to be effective; Ayurvedic preparations are unstandardised and have not gone through rigorous patient trials. They also have the potential to interact and potentially reduce the effectiveness of prescribed medicines.'' There are several reasons why 67 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra HCPs may tell their patients to stop taking HMs including: the risk of herb-drug interactions, adverse effects, reduced compliance with conventional therapy if patients take HMs, and most importantly the lack of scientific evidence to support the safety and efficacy of HMs (Fugh-Berman and Ernst, 2001; Edwards et al., 2012); this concept has been explored further in chapter 3. Evidently there was a fear of telling HCPs about HMs consumed as they may be regarded as inferior to CWM; as exemplified by participant 124 who said she was, ''Too scared to tell the doctor about any herbal medicines taken.'' Also participant 39 claimed, \"My son is a doctor and will not let me take anything herbal, as he says they are all rubbish, even if I know it is good for me.\" Dash and Kashyap (1980) documented that traditional medicine was considered to be substandard in comparison to Western medicine. Participants in this study revealed their anxiety of being treated differently or not treated at all if they exposed their use of HMs to their HCPs. While conducting the questionnaire with participant 2 she said, \"The doctor might refuse my treatment if he knew I was taking herbal medicines!\" Similarly participant 73 said, \"The doctor says why are you coming to us if you want to try different medicines.\" Language and cultural barriers which prevented participants from sharing information about their use of HMs with the HCPs were also identified by participants. Participant 122 was diagnosed with end stage liver cancer, and she revealed how the terrible effects of chemotherapy were relieved by the consumption of HMs, but she did not tell her consultants as she could not speak any English. Some concepts may be difficult to explain to Western HCPs; for example, there is no translation for bhye in English and so it is very difficult to explain this condition to Western HCPs. In turn, this may make people feel like HCPs do not understand their healthcare requirements. This was also reported by participants in the study conducted by Pieroni et al. (2010), which revealed that communication problems between Bangladeshis and HCPs in the UK prevented patients from using CWM appropriately. An interesting point raised by participants 109 and 138 was that they hardly saw their doctor or pharmacist and that is why they did not tell them about their use of HMs; they went on to say if they did see their HCPs, they would mention it. Participants mentioned that they got their prescriptions delivered so did not have any contact with their doctor or pharmacist. The increased popularity of repeat prescription services which are designed to save time for the patient, doctors surgeries, and pharmacies may not be entirely beneficial to patients if it means they do not get to see their HCPs. Ultimately, healthcare is a complex issue especially when combining different cultures and traditions. The results from this question have provided clear examples of why people do not tell their HCPs about the simultaneous use of HMs with CWM. Newall et al., (1996) claim that HMs are becoming more popular and 68 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra therefore HCPs should be aware of alternative therapies; in addition, patients should feel comfortable speaking to their HCPs about their use of HMs without feeling like they are being judged. Question 12 A: Do you notice any unwanted effects from your prescription medicines? 12 B: If Yes, what do you normally do to relieve the symptoms? From the 106 participants who took prescription medication, 43% (n=46) disclosed they had experienced unwanted effects from their medicines (Figure 2-24). Participant 85 claimed, ''Doctors tablets always give me side-effects.'' This was supported by participant 87 who said, ''When you take Western medicines expect more side-effects and tablets to follow.'' Effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, indigestion, cramp, insomnia and back pain were reported by participants; more serious problems such as diabetes and hypertension induced by medication were also noted (Table 2-9). For the relief of the side-effects the majority of participants (54%, n=57) revealed they would go back to see their doctor. Participant 29 stated, ''For side-effects from a tablet the doctor just gives another tablet.'' 31% (n=33) of participants who experienced unwanted effects said they would do nothing, while 15% (n=16) would try a herbal remedy. There was some mention of CWM being 'garam' thus causing many of the side-effects associated."
