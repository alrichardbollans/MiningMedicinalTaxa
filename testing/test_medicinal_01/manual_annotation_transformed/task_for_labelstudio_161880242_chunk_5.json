Depending on subsequent reactions, a simple precursor geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate can produce diverse biologically active polycyclic compound. Taxol is a well known anticancer compound, ginkgolide B is an active component from Ginkgo biloba and abietic acid is the primary irritant in pine wood and resin o f coniferous trees. (Diagram obtained from the Sloan-Kettering Institute official website accessible via www.mskcc.org).High purity andrographolide which is easily obtained commercially was chosen for this study rather than extract from the plant itself. Furthermore, of all phytochemical components identified from A. paniculata, andrographolide was shown to be the most active (Kumar et al., 2004; Nanduri et al., 2004)It is estimated that 40% of plants extracts lack reproducibility of activity (Cordell, 2000) and this is one of the primary obstacles in incorporating flora in pharmaceutical discovery process, despite the diversity o f phytochemicals available. The data generated often do not replicate when sampling and extraction procedures were repeated. Different locations, climates, micro-environments, chemical stimuli and physical stresses, known as elicitors, will affect the content of phytochemicals in quantitative and qualitative manner since the biochemical pathways involved in the biosynthesis o f these bioactive compounds are highly inducible. This is especially true for terpenoids, where levels usually increase up to three orders of magnitude following elicitation (Turlings & Tumlinson, 1992; Trapp & Croteau, 2001). Recently, Bhan et al. (2006) showed the production of andrographolide, neo- andrographolide and 14-deoxy andrographolide from 10 different accessions was susceptibleCopy I2 7Y. Sharifuddin| Chapter 1\\\\| to intrinsic factors such as genotype and ontogeny as well as external factors (elicitors),I which supported previous finding by Pholphana et al. (2004). Other compounds that often ! exhibit the same propensity are phenylpropanoids and alkaloids. Furthermore, the presence I of polyphenols and pigments in complex plant extracts can interfere with the activity of j bioactive compounds.Another important factor is the lack of rapid and efficient methods in isolating and characterising phytochemicals, particularly if they are only present in trace amounts. It usually requires almost 6 months isolating and characterising compounds from a plant extract. This does not include the production of standardised extracts. Cultivation and harvesting times will also affect total yield of andrographolide (Polphana et al., 2004; BhaniI et al., 2006) and the fact that A. paniculata is an annual herb must also be taken into account.| Furthermore, only a standardised extract is ideal for experiments. Thus, employing extracts | for experiments within the time limit for this PhD was not feasible.Other argument that can be put forward is that by studying one potentially beneficial phytochemical at a time, in this case andrographolide, more understanding can be gained on | many aspects of that particular bioactive compound, in contrast to working with standardised | extract where the level of qualitative understanding can be limited. Taxol (paclitaxel), anS important diterpene isolated from Taxus (T. bacata and T. brevifolia) which exhibited anti-!| tumour activity, is a good example. The main impediment to its wide clinical use is the ! sourcing of the compound. To obtain 2.5kg of taxol, approximately 12,000 of T. brevifolia ; must be cut down (Wall & Wani, 1996). Thus, an alternative source must be sought, either from hemi-synthetic production or an analogue from other Taxus species. This task would be both scientifically inappropriate and economically unfeasible if the whole extract is examined rather than potentially beneficial individual compounds.On the other side of the coin, isolating an active compound may exclude other pharmacologically relevant phytochemicals. This is particularly true when pharmacological activity is a result of pharmacokinetic influences and/or pharmacodynamic synergism of more than one bioactive compound. Ginkgolides A, B, C, and M from Ginkgo biloba is a good example.Copy 1 28Y. Sharifuddin| Chapter 1| 1.10 Genotoxicity Information on A. paniculata extracts and AndrographolideIi| Realising the medical potential of A. paniculata, particularly androrapholide which is the I major active compound, genotoxicity testing is crucial. There are no existing genotoxicity | studies published, to the best of the author's knowledge at the time of study, especially | recommended tests for genotoxic potential such as in vitro cytokinesis block micronucleus assay (CBMA). Furthermore, the toxic effects of this plant are not well known.| However, Liu et al. (1990) suggested that the extract of the aerial parts are not mutagenic in vitro. This suggestion is questionable since water extract was used instead of alcohol-based j extract. Most of the experimental pharmacological studies mentioned previously utilised | either alcohol-based or dried extract of the aerial parts or purified andrographolide. Gupta etj| al. (1990,1993) demonstrated that the aqueous extract of the aerial parts was not active iniexerting anti-diarrhoeal activity. Yin et al. (1991) tested the aqueous extract of A. paniculata with the Ames test utilising Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 as well as chromosomal aberration assays in mice did not find a positive result on genotoxicity. However, it must be pointed out that even with plant extracts that yielded positive results, there was noticeable discrepancy in results obtained from the mammalian chromosomal aberration and micronucleus assay with those from the Ames test. Usually, the results obtained from mammalian in vivo tests will outweigh those derived from bacterial test system in vitro. In the study conducted, the coherence between the two was low (Yin et al.,2001). Furthermore, Yin et al. (1991) justified the extraction method employed in the study as to simulate the traditional practice conducted in preparing extract for oral medication. As | has been pointed earlier, aqueous extract of A. paniculata are not ideal for experiment ; because the diterpene lactones such as andrographolide, are sparingly soluble in water compared to methanol or chloroform (O'Neil et al., 2001) therefore reducing the bioavailability of the compound to the target in this case DNA. Thus, aqueous extract of j andrographolide is unable to provide an accurate picture of genotoxicity. Another important | aspect that needs to be considered is the suitability of using bacterial test system such as the Ames test, since the extract of A. paniculata appeared to have antibacterial activity (Singha et j a/., 2003).A standardised dried extract of A. paniculata did not produce reproductive toxicity in male | Sprague-Dawley rats. There was no sign of testicular toxicity with the treatment of 20, 200II Copy1 29| Y. Sharifuddin| Chapter 1\\and lOOOmg/kg body weight for 60 days as evaluated by testicular histology, testosterone levels, reproductive organ weight and ultrastructural analysis of Leydig cells (Burgos et al.,1997). However, the paper mainly concentrated on histological evaluation and no observation was made on the possibilities of genotoxicological effects of the compound examined. Furthermore, it is known that testicular histology is subjective and not quantitative in testicular toxicity evaluation. Akbarsha and Murugaian (2000) demonstrated that the treatment of andrographolide to male Wistar albino rats at 25mg and 50mg/kg body weight for 48 days resulted in decreased sperm counts, immotile spermatozoa with several of them possessing abnormalities, limited number of fully differentiated spermatozoa, the disruption of the seminiferous tubules and seminiferous epithelium as well as vacuolated Sertoli cells.The Leydig cells did not show any pathological change and supported the finding made by Burgos et al. (1997) but there were spermatotoxic effects observed and possible disruption(s) to spermatogenesis.Andrographolide extract did not cause significant reduction in progesterone concentration in pregnant rats and at therapeutic dose, is incapable of inducing progesterone-mediated termination of pregnancy (Panossian et al., 1999). However, the extract of A. paniculata should not be used during pregnancy or lactation due to potential antagonism with endogenous progesterone (Panossian et al., 1999). To the best of the author's knowledge, the teratogenicity effect of the herb has not been evaluated to this date.As a brief summary, Figure 1.11 overleaf illustrated the factors that are involved in the revival of interest in phytomedicines and the imperative needs for more information on their safety and efficacy.Copy I 30Y.

SharifuddinChapter 1CHAPTER 1PART 2: INTRODUCTION TO THE GENETIC TOXICOLOGY IN MAMMALIAN CELLS AND ITS IMPORTANCE1.11 Brief Introduction to Genetic ToxicologyParacelsus first described the 'wasting disease of miners' in 1567 based on his observations in Austrian and other several European mines in the Middle Ages. He later suggested that the exposure to realgar (arsenic sulphide) and other natural ores might have been the culprit in causing this condition, which is today known as cancer. Although this type of cancer was eventually attributed to radioactivity emitted from decay products of radon gas rather than arsenic, Paracelsus was among the first to consider chemical compounds as potential carcinogens.The study of chemical mutagenesis began in the early 1940s when Charlotte Auerbach and colleagues discovered that mustard gas, a chemical warfare agent used against soldiers in trenches during the First World War was capable of causing genetic mutation in fruit fly, Drosophila (reviewed by Beale, 1993). Since then and for the next three decades, most experiments were performed on mice or flies to study chemically-induced mutation. Eventually, better test systems based on yeast and bacteria were developed where data can be obtained cheaper and quicker than using flies or mice. Furthermore, the inclusion of liver extracts and cofactors allowed the detection of more mutagenic agents and highlight the importance of biotransformation in mutagenesis studies. Then, in 1973 Bruce Ames successfully showed that various chemical carcinogens induced mutation in the genetically- engineered Salmonella typhimurium bacteria (Ames et al., 1973), known today as the Ames test which has been widely used to screen potential cancer-causing agents.Genotoxic agents are rather ubiquitous in the environment whether they are man-made products or found naturally. Many synthetic chemicals employed in manufacturing industry,X-rays developed for medical diagnosis and carcinogenic hydrocarbons in coal tar or smelters are examples of genotoxic compounds of man-made in origin. Even the way of howCopy 1 32Y. SharifuddinChapter 1food is being prepared such as grilling red meat at high temperatures are known to yield potent mutagens. Naturally occurring agents include aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus | that grows on nuts and isothiocyanates, the mutagenic phytochemicals found in cruciferousivegetables. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals that are endogenously produced as a result of cellular metabolism are also known to be genotoxic. Figure 1.12 shows the mechanisms of actions of DNA and non-DNA reactive genotoxicants.Genetic toxicology is a broader term than chemical mutagenesis, dedicated to the study of genetic damage, the physical and chemical agents that are responsible, the mechanism involved for it as well as the cellular and organisms' responses to this injury. Since the potential consequences of genetic damage include birth defects and cancer, the elucidation of novel substances' potential to elicit DNA damage and genome instability is an important step in the development of new medicines and other products intended for human use. Various endpoints can be employed in assessing genotoxic damage and they are shown in Figure 1.13.1.12 Biotransformation of XenobioticsAll organisms are constantly exposed to foreign chemicals and these can be man-made (drugs, industrial chemicals) or naturally occurring compounds from the environment.Uptake is usually via ingestion, however inhalation and transdermal routes are also possible.Due to the lipophilicity of many chemicals that facilitate their uptake via these routes, organisms have evolved mechanisms to increase their hydrophilicity for rapid excretion via bile and urine. Otherwise, the accumulation of these xenobiotics will overwhelm defense mechanisms and disrupt systemic homeostasis. This process is known as biotransformation and is catalysed by various enzymes primarily in the liver of higher organisms but are also present in other organs such as the gut, kidneys and lungs.Plants have been known to be one of the reasons for the evolution of biotransformation in animals. Most animals are plant-eaters and customarily being bombarded by various secondary metabolites which play a role in plants' defence mechanisms. However, many chemicals can also be transformed into more reactive metabolites. In pharmacology for example, the metabolites of some parent drugs impose the desired therapeutic effect but inCopy 1 33(r)c<N.5&V. ?s>3d) DOJ) F*Irt al Mo *-- eofi ww) PS~o Of)5b \"35 <u<--* O e i^3 OJ0> csM'7*>>l r. jClJ ^ c<3Z EO C3 w -Os <&*Z << Qr 00<< .S PS 2 * 3<teftsflBIn esVfi.O#*-<w,15 r- ^*\" O *-# ~ CJ-C -- '*#5 >, oO #PS o<L>Y.

Different compounds will possess varying effects due to the length of time they remain in the organism. A compound that is toxicologically very active but is extremely hydrophilic will be easily excreted from the body without the possibility of inducing severe damage in contrast to relatively low activity compound that is hydrophobic but lingers longer in the body and could potentially be more harmful. Biotransformation will be discussed in greater length in Part 2 of the second Chapter in this thesis.I| Various pro-mutagenic and pro-carcinogenic compounds require metabolic activation before| they can exert their effect and typical cell culture techniques do not often maintain the[ metabolic capacity of the liver. Accordingly, the addition of S9-fraction of liver homogenateinto cell cultures in vitro was intended to provide an external metabolic capability. The creation of cell lines for genotoxicology applications, which have been genetically engineered to be metabolically competent such as AHH-1 and MCL-5 serve as an alternative ! to the addition of S9-fraction, thus permitting the assessment of xenobiotics that needjbioactivation.1.13 The Cycle of Cell DivisionCells proliferate in response to extracellular growth factors, passing through a repeated sequence of events known as the cell cycle. This has four major phases: Gi, then S, G2 and lastly the mitotic or M-phase. This is followed by division of the cytoplasm and plasma membrane to produce two daughter cells. Gi, S and G2 together constitute interphase, which is the majority of the cell cycle. During interphase, the cytoplasm increase in volume, the DNA is uncoiled then diffuse within the nucleus and is a stage of general growth where ribosomes, mitochondria and other cellular proteins are synthesise. The chromosomes are replicated during the DNA synthetic or S-phase. Most somatic cells in the body are not actively dividing and are arrested at Go within Gi. Figure 1.14 shows the assorted phases of the cell cycle.Copy 1 35Y. Sharifuddin. 2008C/0#r <utransformation of the cells' physiology and morphology for example, from normal to malignant form.
