      "text": "Turmeric (Curcuma longa L., Indian name: haldi) is commonly known as a spice, colorant and food preservative, which has several proposed medicinal benefits. It is said to have antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects (Colalto, 2010). Curcumin, identified as the yellow pigment in turmeric, is a compound found in the rhizome of the plant; which is a therapeutically active component in turmeric responsible for its versatile medicinal properties (Sikora et al., 2010). Chemotherapeutic agents inhibit the hyperproliferation of cells, which develop into cancer. Synthetic drugs are often expensive, difficult to synthesise and have multiple side effects. On the other hand, curcumin extracted from turmeric is cheap, widely available, and is believed to kill tumour cells as it interferes with several cell signalling pathways that cause cell death by apoptosis and necrosis (Ravindran, et al., 2009; Sikora et al., 2010). Garlic (Allium sativum L., Indian name: lasan) is another popular ingredient used in many herbal formulations; which is believed to have antibacterial, anti-platelet, and anti-hypertensive effects. The therapeutically active components recognised in garlic are allicin and alliin (Colalto, 2010; Garodia, 2006). A review by Tovar and Petzel (2009) analysed the efficacy of garlic for treating dyslipidaemia, and its action in reducing high cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis; 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase. Garlic is effective at reducing low density lipids and triglycerides which contribute to high cholesterol; accordingly the benefits of reduced cholesterol correlate to reduced risk of stroke and heart disease. The antibacterial action of garlic was also observed in the West by the renowned scientist Louis Pasteur in 1858, who noted that bacteria died when they were exposed to garlic; crushed garlic juice was also used during the Second World War in wounds to prevent infections (Taylor, 2007; Arora and Kaur, 1999; Williamson, 2002). The mode of action is believed to be due to the active molecules, allicin 25 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra and alliin which interfere with thiol groups on bacterial and fungal enzymes, affecting essential metabolism leading to cell death, thus eradicating the organism (Williamson, 2002). There are numerous HMs which are getting recognition for their pharmacological effects in the Western world. Dentists commonly recommend cloves (Eugenia caryophylatta Thunb., Indian name: long) to their patients for toothaches. The dried flower buds have powerful anaesthetic, analgesic, antiseptic, antimicrobial and anti-emetic effects (Chevallier, 2007). Eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) has been identified as the active substance responsible for many of the medicinal benefits of cloves. The culinary use of cloves is not only to add a spicy aromatic flavour, but traditionally it was added to prevent food spoilage and to aid digestion (Trajano et al., 2010). Another product which is being recognised for its cosmetic value is neem (Azadirachta indica A.Juss. ); commercial soaps, shampoos, face washes, creams and lotions are now readily available. The neem tree is native to South Asia, and can grow up to thirty five meters tall; all parts of the tree can be used including the seeds, leaves and bark. It has been described as a pharmacy in its own right due to the many health benefits associated with it (Chevallier, 2007), including: antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, antipruritic, anti-cancer and a blood purifying properties (Kumar et al., 2006; Boursier et al., 2011; Pandikumar et al., 2011). The Foundation for Revitalisation of Local Health Traditions (FRLHT) in Bangalore, India, has established various projects across India to document the use of traditional HMs. One of the key priorities is to build a bridge between the traditional use and knowledge of HMs and modern scientific advances. By engaging in clinical research the FRLHT aims to establish clinical theories to support traditional use of HMs. By working with local communities, farmers, traditional healers, schools and educational institutes they have tried to preserve cultural heritage, cultivate sustainable resources, and provide an evidence base for traditional Ayurvedic practices (FRLHT, 2015). 2.4.4 Ethnopharmacological Research in the UK Ethnopharmacology is \"the scientific study of ethnic groups and their use of drugs\" (Johnson and Sargent, 1996). Ethnopharmacological research involves a multi-disciplinary approach whereby botany, chemistry, pharmacognosy, pharmacology and other disciplines are considered to document traditional knowledge and use of medicinal plants (King, 1992; Patwardhan, 2005; Heinrich et al., 2006). The research methods used are diverse and tailored to the objectives of the investigation (Elisabetsky and Etkin, 2009). Plant material may be collected, identified and examined by botanists and other scientists while social science 26 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra inquires may be conducted to explore the medicinal ethnography (Elisabetsky and Etkin, 2009; Mukherjee et al., 2010). By combining methodologies from several disciplines such as social and natural science the objective of ethnopharmacological research which sets out to explore and understand traditional systems of medicine can be attained (Elisabetsky and Etkin, 2009). There is a vast amount of ethnopharmacological research which has explored the use of traditional HMs by people around the world (Chhetri, 1994; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Malla and Chhetri, 2009; Kunwar et al., 2010; Ayyanar and Ignacimuthu, 2011; Bhatia et al., 2014). Pieroni et al. (2010) claims that most ethnobotanical research is conducted in exotic places and that a gradual shift towards exploring what is going on in 'back yards and urban environments' will occur. They go on to say that ethnobotanists began to explore the use of plants by migrant populations in the late 1990s in North America; this was driven by an increasing interest in the use and perception of traditional HMs. In the UK, surveys to explore the use of HMs have been conducted (Ipsos MORI, 2008; Mintel, 2009); however, there is limited research into the use of HMs by SA communities in the UK (Bhopal, 1986a; Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Pieroni and Torry, 2007; Pieroni et al., 2010). Bhopal (1986a) conducted interviews with 65 Asian participants in Glasgow to explore the role of TM in an Asian community. He discovered that the knowledge of HMs amongst participants was high, but HMs only had a modest role in participants' healthcare. Participants did not feel it was necessary to disclose information about their use of HMs to their HCPs; so Bhopal explored HCPs views of HMs too. He offered general practitioners (n=33) and healthcare workers (n=10) the opportunity to complete a questionnaire about Asian patients' use of HMs. The results revealed that HCPs awareness of Asian HMs was 'extremely low' and HCPs were unaware of their patients' use of HMs. As the research was conducted on a small Asian community in Glasgow the results are not representative of SAs in the UK; in addition, as the research was conducted in 1986 the results are now dated. Sandhu and Heinrich (2005) explored the knowledge and use of HMs amongst a Sikh Punjabi community in London, by conducting semi-structured interviews with 84 participants. They documented the use of numerous HMs by the research participants and uncovered how participants managed minor ailments. As this research was focused on a specific religious (Sikh) and cultural group (Punjabi) the results are not representative of SAs; the authors do highlight that there is an urgent need to investigate the use of HMs amongst other ethnic groups in the UK. The study by Pieroni and Torry (2007) focused specifically on Kashmiri, Gujarati, and English participants medical perception of five 'herbal drugs' (cinnamon, cloves, garlic, 27 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra ginger, and mint). A questionnaire was completed by 274 participants who were asked to state the perceived medicinal properties and uses of the products listed. They found a difference in traditional knowledge amongst the ethnic groups; whereby, Kashmiri participants had widespread knowledge of the herbal drugs listed while it was less prevalent amongst Gujarati and especially English participants. Pieroni et al. (2010) conducted interviews (n=37) and focus groups (n=42) with Bengalis in Bradford to explore their use of traditional HMs. They recorded approximately 150 herbal preparations recalled by participants, and identified that many of them were still commonly used in the UK. Pieroni et al. (2010) found that middle-aged and older participants were more accurately able to recall HMs than younger participants; moreover, younger generations seemed to prefer CWM over traditional HMs. The results of this research indicate that HMs are still commonly used by Bangladeshi migrant communities in the UK. The current research on SA communities' use of HMs in the UK is limited; but, it has provided a basis for conducting this research. Some of the concepts explored by other researchers will be further investigated in this study, to help gain a better understanding about the current use of HMs by SAs in the UK. 28 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.5 Methodology 2.5.1 Questionnaire Design A questionnaire to meet the aims and objectives of the SATMED project was designed; to explore the current use of HMs amongst SA diasporic communities in the UK. Several draft copies of the questionnaire were piloted; Malhotra and Birks (2006) refer to pilot studies as, ''testing the questionnaire on a small sample of respondents for the purpose of improving the questionnaire by identifying and eliminating potential problems.'' Amendments made to the questionnaire included: reducing the length of the survey without compromising the quality of the data, removing a question which used images of HMs which was ambiguous, and rewording some questions (Appendix 1). After which a more refined and tailored questionnaire was produced to meet the objectives of the research (Appendix 3). A participant information leaflet (PIL) was provided to participants to inform them about the purpose of the research (Appendix 4). Initially the questionnaire was designed for participants to complete themselves; however, after conducting a pilot study the researcher believed it was more appropriate to administer the questionnaire personally. Several reasons for changing the way the questionnaire was conducted included: incomplete questionnaires, participants dropping out part-way, illegible handwriting, and feedback from participants who stated the survey was too long to write answers to despite having great knowledge of HMs. To ensure no bias was introduced from the researcher when asking the questions, thorough training from Professor Mark Johnson was attained; the training enabled the researcher to develop skills to keep participants engaged and affirmed how to ask the questions. Although this process was time consuming for the researcher the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. Advantages of the researcher administering the questionnaires included: the chance to build rapport with the participants - gaining trust and better responses to questions, a higher response rate, more complete questionnaires returned, and clarification of questions therefore less invalid responses (Dornyei and Taguchi 2010). Furthermore, as the researcher was fluent in Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu it was easier to engage participants who could not understand, read or write English. A mixture of open and closed (quantitative and qualitative) questions were used in this survey. One of the reasons for using quantitative questions was so the data obtained could be statistically analysed; enabling the quantification of data and comparisons to be made. While the qualitative questions obtained richer, more in-depth knowledge of the individual participants' perception regarding the objectives of the study (Levin et al., 2008). The questionnaire took on average ten to twenty minutes to complete. 29 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.5.2 The Target Research Population The participant inclusion criteria for this research stated participants must be over eighteen years of age (so they could consent for their own participation without the need for parental consent), and from a South Asian (SA) background (i.e. Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi) (Office for National Statistics, 2012). There is no existing database which permits randomised or systematic identification of a suitable population of SA origin (i.e. the sampling frame); therefore, an opportunity sampling technique was used. For this reason there was no pre-defined target of gender or age group to survey. Malhotra and Birks (2006) say opportunity sampling involves, ''being in the right place at the right time.'' The sampling method used followed established practice in other similar studies whereby the target research population was directly approached in anticipation of recruiting more participants (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Pieroni et al., 2010). Participants were reassured that all responses would remain anonymous (as no personal identifiable data was taken), and confidential. All the responses were kept in the possession of the primary researcher with no unauthorised access. A unique aspect of this study was that it focused on SA populations as a whole; whereas, most other studies focused on single ethnic or religious groups (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Jennings, 2014; Pieroni et al., 2010). 2.5.3 Ethical Approval De Montfort University (DMU) ethical approval was obtained before the questionnaires were distributed (Appendix 1). The questionnaire and PIL (Appendix 3 & 4) were reviewed by the DMU ethics committee, who gave feedback and some minor suggestions. Instead of using the phrase 'side-effects' they recommended using a more neutral statement such as 'unwanted' or 'unexpected' effects. The ethics committee also commented on the length of the survey, which after the first pilot study was shortened; as some questions were removed or merged together. 2.5.4 Questionnaire Distribution In total two hundred questionnaires were conducted across several locations in Birmingham and Leicester (one hundred in each city); two cities the primary researcher knew well (Table 2-1). The Census statistics suggested that Birmingham and Leicester would provide a reliable base for the field work as 7% of the population of England are now of SA origin; hence, the data would have wider applicability (Office for National Statistics, 2012). 30 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Statistics revealed that over 30% of the residents in Birmingham are from an ethnic minority group. The SA communities of interest in Birmingham have increased from 17.9% in 2001 to 22.5% in 2011 (Office for National Statistics, 2012).The demographic profile of Leicester, in 2007, revealed that approximately 40% of Leicester's population were from an ethnic minority background (Leicester City Council, 2007). The 2011 Census suggests that the minority population of Leicester has risen to 54.9%, 35.8% of SA background (Office for National Statistics, 2012).

SPSS has multiple advantages over other analytical software including: the range of statistical techniques which enable exploration of relationships between variables (e.g. T-tests and analysis of variance test). In addition, significant differences between variables can be tested and cross-tabulations can also be created (Pallant, 2007). The software enables data to be coded; thus, allowing both quantitative and qualitative responses to be analysed. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to create the graphical representations. The number (n) of participants or responses will be referenced throughout the results. 31 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.6 Results and Discussion This section will summarise the results of the SATMED questionnaire. The survey was split into four segments: the first section explored participants' demographics, the second looked at the use of traditional herbal remedies, the third at the use of prescription medication, and finally the treatment of minor ailments. Although, two hundred surveys were conducted across several locations in Birmingham and Leicester, eight were discarded as they were either incomplete or the participants did not come under the SA inclusion criteria, leaving a total of one hundred and ninety two surveys for analysis. 2.6.1 Sample Description This section was designed to determine participants' age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and occupation. In addition, participants were asked where they currently lived, were born, and where their parents were born to establish migration patterns and links between their knowledge of herbal medicines (HMs) and their heritage. A total of 192 questionnaires were used in this analysis. Gender and Age Profile of Participants The sample was comprised of 69% (n=132) female and 31% (n=60) male participants. As an opportunity sampling technique was employed, there was no method of screening or selecting the research sample to ensure an equal number of female and male participants were selected. One of the reasons for having more female respondents was due to the locations where the research was conducted; in the community and day centres visited in both Birmingham and Leicester it was observed that there was always a disproportionately larger number of females in comparison to males."
