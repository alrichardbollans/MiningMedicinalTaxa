      "text": "The creation of an identity and a group of like-minded contacts built around the material 'things' (the products) draws on an assemblage of entrepreneurialism, social capital (Lin, 2007), brand commitment and loyalty (Hur et al., 2011), while also being inspired by the idea of helping (or saving) others whose health is affected. The implicit promise is not only of health and happiness, but also prosperity for those who are prepared to place their trust in the company and its products. Pratt (2000: 456) interprets this strategy as a necessary one to 'win the hearts and minds' of those who work for a network marketing organisation in the absence of regular hours, work colleagues, a physical location, and the psychological contract of job security provided in the traditional workplace. 137 Part of the identity creation appears to be the implicit invitation to the distributor to model themselves on the inspirational life story of the company founder which, as Cardwell (1998:17) describes, commonly follows a nearly identical trajectory in all companies: ...the guru as head of the company [who] ...was told by conventional medicine that he ... had only six weeks/months/hours to live. Fortunately they found one or more 'natural' plant based products that cured their cancer ... and now they have a fundamental and evangelistic desire to sell their amazing product to the world. This was indeed closely paralleled by four stories that were related to me by different participants about four different brands of products. Each time it was presented as a type of hero's journey (Campbell, 1973); the quest of the company founder to overcome a health threat to themselves or a close family member; the breakthrough discovery after a period of isolation or intense study; the struggle to overcome others' disbelief; and their subsequent dedication to sharing their discovery for the betterment of the world and making a fortune in the process. Here is just one of them: The history behind it was a guy from South Korea [who] was a billionaire. He was an industrialist and the story is that he got stomach cancer. So he went and lived up in the mountains somewhere and started eating an aloe plant, and basically lived off an aloe vera plant for quite a long time and then went back down and got tested and his stomach cancer was gone. So he took all his money and basically sold all his assets from his steel and invested it in this technology for aloe vera plants and then built these big farms and then started a system where you buy in, you sell it to your friends and you get a profit. .... they would give this big seminar to everyone and tell them how this special herbal - medicine I guess - has changed their life. Everything from people's stomach cramps to all these different types of healing, almost like miracles that they've experienced with this. (Duncan) These narratives with their tales of the quest, seclusion from the world, and return with \"the goods of salvation\" (Rey, 2004: 331), had unmistakable overtones that resonated with the myths, legends, and religious figures that were described in the background chapter. Albertson (2011: 127) draws attention to the implicit appeal of religious language in societies where \"...religion has old roots in the lives of many ... people carry emotional and cognitive residue from their pasts that are at work in their current political attitudes and choices.\" Even for those without these religious echoes from their past, the narratives in fairy tales abound with the 138 same elements of quest and salvation. These generic tales or \"ur-narratives ...contain the seeds of many genres\" (Berger 2016: 71); in them the heroes are often aided by magic objects or 'things' through which they manage to find the inner strength to prevail over difficulties. The universal appeal of the hero(ine) winning the battle against the odds would seem to be not only deeply rooted in the ancient myths of humanity's distant past but to be always evolving, rearranging itself to any context without losing its intrinsic qualities. Rey (2004: 333) has drawn attention to the way these ur-narratives are echoed in economic success stories of this sort, when the company founder, the 'charismatic prophet' produces symbolic goods for benefit of the people. Even in network marketing the reworking of these themes with their origins in the distant past demonstrates that \"mythology shows itself to be as amenable as life itself to the obsessions and requirements of the individual, the race, the age\" (Campbell 1973: 330). All the companies named by study participants were based in the United States, where there is a lengthy history of network marketing companies being investigated by the US Food and Drug Administration for deceptive marketing practices or conducting illegal pyramid selling schemes focused around the material products (Anonymous, 2003; Berg, 1994; Herbig & Yelkurm, 1997). One controversial area has been the evangelistic nature of network company distributors in their efforts to recruit others. The fascination and fear associated with such companies has led to them being described as cults (Bhattacharya & Mehta, 2000; Krzywirzeka, 2013) who use \"mind control\" (Pratt, 2000: 456) to exert overly strong attachments among their adherents. Certainly those participants who were currently distributors for network marketing companies at the time I spoke to them were fulsome and evangelistic in the way they spoke about the products (the 'things'). They demonstrated high levels of commitment, enthusiasm, and a sense of making a worthwhile contribution by making the company products available to people who needed help. While they at no time appeared to be in the grip of a cult, I gained the impression that too much confidence in the company's products could lead to potentially overblown claims about what their 'things' could achieve. One network marketer gave an account of stepping in to help an acquaintance who was awaiting an amputation in hospital because of diabetic complications: So it is a very simple programme getting rid of diabetes and our shake just puts your blood sugar right straight away. ... Well! The next day he is sitting up in bed and he is coming to life already. Each day they said, Oh, he's getting stronger by the day. Well, when they got him back [to hospital], his blood sugar was exactly right ... Everything was coming right after four days and then the surgeon looked at his leg and said, \"I must have made a mistake. He doesn't need his leg off!\" (Clara) 139 Clara here represents the 'shake' that she gave to her acquaintance as being the 'goods of salvation' mentioned above, that saved his leg. Molly, however, was much more reserved about what she claimed to do herself, noting that she would never give more than generic advice but would always refer to other sources in her company: There's certain things you can and can't do. So if you are not a qualified nutritionist you can't give nutrition advice. .... You've just got to be really careful and that's fair enough because if you are not qualified I don't feel you should do it anyway. (Molly) Another major criticism of network marketing has highlighted the high rates of turnover among disillusioned distributors, with some said to be filled with hatred for the companies they formerly belonged to (Pratt, 2000; Mswelli and Sargeant, 2001). There were a few study participants who were ex-network marketers, but they were neutral about the companies they had been involved with. It seemed that they had mostly been drawn in to oblige a friend or relative but and had never fully 'bought in' emotionally to the assemblage of discourses that hinged on the 'thing power' of the products that the companies sold. Moreover, the expense of the products deterred younger people who were not yet well established financially and they found the commitment more than they could maintain on their limited budget: I think it was about $60 ... I remember I got a discount I think of 20%. That was still a lot for me anyway. I think they would expect you to get a new one [pack] every one or two months. I can't really afford that. (Iris) Duncan also had a history of being both a user and distributor and although he had extricated himself from the company without great difficulty, he admitted that the entanglement of personal and business relationships had made it awkward. He too had found it an expensive exercise: It's a community; you make friends, you get involved and it almost turns into a community group. You know, you go to meetings together and you make friends... And then they would say, well you know, you purchase this. The thing was that a bottle like this [indicating size] was about $90 so it would last you a month. (Duncan) Network marketing proved to be an interesting way of examining the assemblage of actants around supplements from a different angle. It encompassed the same levers of supply and demand, and the same discourses of naturalness and risk. However, it differed in that it drew directly on personal commitment to a particular company and appealed more intensely to 140 emotional engagement with 'things' which not only had value as supplements but also symbolised the underlying narrative of altruism and salvation more overtly entangled with the economic values of entrepreneurialism and personal profit (Berger, 2016: 71), in a way that was absent from those participants who sold products in health stores and pharmacies. Conclusion In concluding this chapter, it is useful to return to Bennett's words quoted at the beginning of the chapter, framing non-human matter as: ...an actant inside and alongside intention-forming, morality-(dis)obeying, language using, reflexivity wielding and culture making human beings and as an inducer-producer of salient, public effects (Bennett, 2010: 39). Assemblages of ingested matter, whether supplements, pharmaceuticals or ordinary foods, whether helpful or harmful, have been analysed from countless medical, public health, commercial, and sociological perspectives but human behaviour has almost always been at the centre of these analyses (Flegal et al., 2012; Gotay et al., 2013; Mayes, 2015; Mitchell, 2001; Wang & Lim, 2012). Here, in contrast, non-human things have been brought into the foreground as vital matter that acted as an important catalyst in the participants' lives. What may have begun as a minor or random decision to take a supplement 'thing' appeared to have had the power to generate physical, mental and spiritual effects in their lives and given them hope for the future, even if their basic conditions were still troublesome. They had developed a personal story around their supplement use that resulted from a maze of connections in which the material products - the things - had a central role in making their story what it was. The meaning was what mattered; the precise mechanism by which the 'thing' mattered, appeared to be irrelevant. Humans organize their experiences into temporarily meaningful episodes. Narrative is both a mode of reasoning and a mode of representation. People can \"apprehend\" the world narratively and people can \"tell\" about the world narratively. ... Explanation in the narrative mode is contextually embedded, whereas the logico-scientific explanation is extracted from spatial and temporal events. Both modes are rational ways of making meaning (Richardson, 1990: 118). Moreover, the meaning they drew from their products was not static but always in process, constantly forming and reforming as it evolved and changed. The participants were part of this 141 dynamic evolution, contributing to its onward movement through the effects of their actions to research, purchase and consume supplements to look after their health. These activities were also changing the participants themselves as they gained experience and expertise as 'supplement users'. The effect of their interaction with the 'thing power' of the supplements appeared to have given them a sense of control over their health care options and to be an important influence in their decision making not only for themselves but in their interactions with orthodox health care options. The next chapter moves on to tackle the issue of power and expertise over health and to look at the part supplements played in identity building for participants in their ongoing life journey. 142 Chapter 6: Supplements: through responsibility and expertise to power Introduction The previous chapter ended by looking forward to the sense of control that the participants experienced through making independent decisions around supplements and health. This chapter examines the assemblage of ideas that had come together to build that sense of control. Primarily, these focused around two prominent themes that were raised by the participants: being responsible about their health, and developing expertise in doing so. The participants clearly saw themselves as responsible people who were taking every care to look after their health, yet they were quite well aware that supplement use was not endorsed as a responsible practice by health experts. They did not see this as a conflict, however, but viewed their supplements as something extra that they could do over and above following the recommended precepts about living a healthy life. Moreover, they explained, they were becoming their own experts about supplements and their uses, searching out information from a wide range of sources and putting their new knowledge into practice as they learned more about them. For those participants who also sold supplements, this included building expertise in how to advise others in their use. To examine these issues relating to the tension between authorised advice and independent decisions that deviate from it, this chapter draws from Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality as they are manifested in the modern neoliberal state. As Foucault described it, biopower is the guiding and shaping of citizens to be \"eminently governable\" neoliberal subjects (Lorenzini, 2018: 155). Biopower operates through what Foucault termed the 'conduct of conduct' (Burchell et al., 1991; Foucault, 1988; Lemke, 2002), that is, the provision of guidance by officially authorised experts so that people internalise the approved way to behave and do so freely, but in a way which also serves the interests of the state (Danaher et al., 2000; Petersen & Lupton, 1996). In the sphere of health, governmentality works by encouraging people to take responsibility for looking after themselves according to the advice of medical professionals and public health experts who are credentialed and sanctioned by the state. They are seen as the repository of expert knowledge which is deployed in \"shaping the thoughts and actions of subjects in order to make them more useful and 'governable'\"(Petersen & Lupton, 1996: 14). Choosing to follow the advice and make 'correct' choices, they reduce their likelihood of becoming unwell and therefore creating a burden for themselves and for the state to look 143 after. Responsible citizens who have internalised this advice and willingly submit to this 'conduct of conduct', have the greatest likelihood of being considered well-ordered and healthy, thereby contributing to the productivity of the state as a whole. While individuals are not forced to conform to these norms, they are encouraged to see them as being in their own interests. Nevertheless, many people do resist being 'conducted' according to recommended advice. They may continue to smoke, drink too much alcohol or keep on with 'unhealthy eating' that makes them overweight, even though they know quite well that these are not considered responsible health practices. Yet all these behaviours are quite legal and the products that enable them are easily available, often heavily advertised with special offers and discounting that make them even more attractive. Viewed from an economic perspective, the buying and selling of such things is generally seen as uncontroversial, for they fit with the modern neoliberal state's focus on ensuring that the freedom of the market is maintained, that consumers keep spending, and that the economy continues to grow. The interests of the market, therefore, frequently run directly counter to expert advice on health and take precedence over policies which would be likely to constrain commercial activity and inhibit growth. Instead, the onus is placed on individuals to be 'responsible' and refrain from indulging in behaviours which are not approved (Herrick, 2011). Clearly, supplements are in a different category from these overtly harmful products, but they too are frowned on by health experts, albeit for different reasons. There are continuing calls for more restrictions on their availability or to bring them under the control of health professionals. Yet the importance of the commercial activity these products generate (Grand View Research, 2019) appears to outweigh the voices of health experts when it comes to policy making and regulations. By resisting authorised health advice and instead turning to the market for their products, however, it may be that individuals who wish to use or sell supplements are merely exchanging one form of being conducted for another, that is, the subtle and less overtly stated form of control that commercial interests exercise over people who buy their products (Kasabov, 2004). Foucault's concept of governmentality has been taken up and applied to this viewpoint as well, showing that the ever increasing use of digital surveillance is continually and relentlessly gathering and analysing the personal details and habits of those who buy, whether they shop online or in person (Ganesh, 2016). This digital surveillance has been likened to an \"electronic super-Panopticon\" (Zwick & Knott, 2009: 227) that constructs consumers as passive commodities to be manipulated by personalised advertising (Couldry & Turow, 2014). They are seen as being induced to spend money on products that merely enrich commercial companies 144 and their shareholders and that do nothing to benefit the people that buy them (Boyd & Crawford, 2012; Brayne, 2017; Ganesh, 2016). This construction, however, would seem to underestimate the power of ordinary citizens. The tensions between the two competing forces - that is, the conduct of citizens by expert health advice and the machinations of the market to control them - create areas of \"fragility and blindspots\" where the modern neoliberal state is at cross purposes with itself (Lorenzini, 2018: 157). Individuals such as the participants may engage in what Foucault termed \"strategic games between liberties\" (Foucault 1988 cited in Lemke 2002: 53), that is, they may use their freedom creatively to exploit those tensions and resist being 'conducted' quite so much (Lorenzini, 2018). In effect, this response by individuals is another example of the far reaching interconnections that are possible in the rhizomatic network of actants that are interconnected in a moving assemblage around a particular issue. By exploring and experimenting with ways to benefit from all the options that are available from both orthodox health advice and the commercial market, and resisting and avoiding those aspects they dislike, they may develop expertise in using both to maximum advantage for themselves, thereby gaining a sense of control and independence from both. This chapter has three sections that discuss these issues in the light of the participants' reports. The first focuses on the participants' construction of themselves as responsible and morally 'good' people who took great care to look after their health."
