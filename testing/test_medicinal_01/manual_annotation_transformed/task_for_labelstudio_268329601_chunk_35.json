      "text": "A carbohydrate source (adjunct), such as rice, corn,wheat, or potatoes, is added to the malt. The mixtureoften consists of about 65% malt and 35% adjunct.This combination is called the mash. The liquidportion of the mash is the wort. After it is drawn off,the barley grains are collected, dried, and used ascattle feed.Most American beers are not only malted, but alsohopped, which means that the wort is boiled with hopsfor two or three hours. Hops is made from the bractssurrounding the female flowers of Humulus lupulus, avine in the hemp family (Cannabaceae). California isone of the main producers of hops in the U. S. Itimparts the characteristic bitter flavor to beer andhelps to clarify it. Clarification is the coagulation ofnitrogen-containing materials in the wort. Most of ourbeers do not have a high hops content; Europeanversions are usually much higher.The cooled wort is now placed in large tanks where itis inoculated with a select strain of Saccharomycescerevisiae, a yeast. It will act on the wort to producecarbon dioxide, ethyl alcohol, and minor organicconstituents. At this stage, the fermented beer iscalled green beer. After a couple of days of initialfermentation, the green beer is transferred to lageringvats where a secondary fermentation occurs. Duringthis several day process, various organic materialscoagulate as scum. The beer is then aged for a periodlasting from a few weeks to a few months. Young beermay be added just before bottling to bring thecarbonation to a desired level or carbon dioxide maybe artificially added. The beer is then filtered andusually pastuerized. Draft beer is not pastuerized. Thefinal product is about 5% ethyl alcohol (ethanol), 90%water, along with maltose (a sugar), gums, dextrins,and various nitrogenous substances.THE BREWING PROCESSBarley soaked and germinatedLSteeped in warm water 2-3 daysLPartly germinated grain (malt) heated and driedLStore 20-30 daysLMalt + warm water (mashing)LSweet, brown liquid (wort)LAdd adjuncts (cereal, potato, etc. )LFilterLAdd hopsLBoil (2+ hours)LCoolLCentrifugeLAdd cultured yeastLFerment(8-11 days for beer)(5-6 days for ale)LSkim to remove yeastLGreen beerLAdd yeast, sugar, or fresh wortLFermentLClarifyLBottle or canLPasteurize (keg)orUnpasteurized (draft beer)[After McGee, 1984]TYPES OF BEERMALTED BEERSAle has a higher hops concentration and a higheralcohol content (4-7%). It is brewed at a highertemperature and it is made by yeasts floating on thesurface of the wort, rather than those on the bottomof the tank.Bock is a potent dark beer. It is often made from thefirst hops and malt of the season.Porter is a dark, sweet, bock-like ale. It is usuallyaged for six to eight weeks. It is often made from aninferior malt and then colored with caramel or licorice.Stout is a porter-like beer of high alcohol content andwith a strong hop flavor. It is heavier than porterbeers and it is usually aged for about a year.Kvass or quass is a Russian beer made from barleyand rye and flavored with peppermint.Pombe or bousa is an African beer made from milletgrains.Weiss is a light, malty ale made mostly from wheat.UNMALTED BEERSChicha is a very popular South American beer that ispractically unknown in the U. S. It can be made froma variety of carbohydrate sources, including maize,potatoes, manioc, plantain, and palms. The enzymesneeded for fermentation to occur are provided byhuman saliva using the ancient \"chew and spit\"process.Ginger beer is produced by allowing a sugar solutioncontaining ginger rhizomes to be acted upon by yeastand bacteria.Hard cider is based upon the fact that many kinds offruits, especially the apple, ferment quickly. A largeproportion of the apple cider that we make is allowedto undergo acetic acid fermentation that will yieldcommercial vinegar.Mead is made with fermented honey. It is soconcentrated that fungi and bacteria cannot live easily-121-in it, which explains its long shelf life. It played animportant role in the 30 day wedding ceremonies, the\"honeymoon,\" of the Scandi-navians.Pulque is a favorite Mexican beer made from the sapof several different century plants (Agave spp. ).Root beer is made from herbs, barks, roots, sugar,and yeast. Sarsaparilla, ginger, and wintergreen areoften used. There is, of course, the non-alcoholicversion sold by Hires, and others.Sake (also spelled saki) is a Chinese and Japanesefavorite made by fermenting steamed rice.Fermentation is accomplished by Aspergillus oryzae,rather than Saccharomyces. The alcohol content ishigher than that of typical wine or beer. Sake issometimes treated as a kind of wine.WINE\"Wine is the most healthful and hygienic ofbeverages.\" [Louis Pasteur]' ' ' ' 'Wine-making is one of our most ancient enterprises.We read in Genesis that the first thing that Noah didafter the waters of the Great Flood had receded wasto plant a vineyard. We know, with perhaps morecertainty, that the ancient Mesopotamians made winethousands of years ago. The Greeks and Romans werewell-versed in the subject. Their wines were stored for15-25 years in a two-handled, earthenware vesselcalled an amphora. They also used amphorae to storeoils.By the Middle Ages, amphorae had been replaced bywooden casks. The habit at that time was not to fillthe casks completely. Contact with air in the barrelmade the wines turn to vinegar rather quickly, somost of these wines had to be drunk within a year orso. In 1690, Dom Pierre Perignon rediscovered the useof the cork and began storing champagne in newlydeveloped strong, glass bottles.The European colonists established vineyards aroundthe world. By the mid-1600's, the Spanish had plantedgrapes in Mexico, Chile, and Argentina. South Africahad vineyards a century later. California and Australiawere planted in the later part of the 18th century;New Zealand followed a few decades later.In 1863, the vineyards of the Rhone Valley in Francewere attacked by a root louse (Phylloxera vastatrix),imported accidently from the United States. Thisinsect caused the grape vines to loose their leaves andit eventually killed them. The European cultivars werehighly susceptible and the plague spread through thevineyards with appalling speed. Many treatments wereattempted, but the one that proved to be mostsuccessful involved grafting European cultivars ontoAmerican strains that were resistant to Phylloxera.The insect has never been eradicated from thevineyards. Almost all of today's wines are made fromgrafted vines.Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Chile, France,Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Soviet Union, Spain, andthe United States are the leading wine-producingcountries. France, Italy, and Spain are the top three,usually in that order.There are many species of grapes known throughoutthe world, but only one of them, the European Vitisvinifera meets all of the requirements for making anexcellent wine. Its fruit contains enough of the rightkinds of sugars with the properly low acidity so thatthe juices can be made into a stable and balancedwine without having to add large amounts of sugar orwater. We have domesticated thousands of cultivarsof this single species and they provide most of theworld's wine.DEFINITIONMany authorities restrict the term \"wine\" to fermentedgrape products. Other fruit sources, such as cherries,blackberries, and elderberries, often referred to aswines, are then considered to be hard ciders. Whilethe definition of \"wine\" may be a broad one in thestudy of economically important plants, it often is verynarrow in the legal sense. California restricts the termto only those products with a minimum percentage ofgrapes used in their manufacture.TYPES OF WINEThere are four commonly recognized categories ofwines. In dry wines, almost all of the sugar in thegrape has been fermented into ethanol and carbondioxide. The finished wine typically has an alcoholcontent of about 12%.In unfortified sweet wines, only a portion of thesugar is broken down. These are rich, sweet whitewines made from partly dehydrated grapes or fromthose that have been attacked by the \"noble rot,\"caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. In either case,the yeasts are killed by the level of alcohol produced(14%) before they can break down the highconcentrations of sugar present in the grapes.In sparkling wines, a second fermentation occursinside sealed containers. More sugar and yeasts areadded to the finished wine to set the stage. Becausethe second fermentation occurs inside sealed vessels,any carbon dioxide produced will remain in the wine,making it effervescent. The best known example of asparkling wine comes from the Champagne region ofFrance. In the strict sense, it must be made frompinot noir, pinot meunier, or Chardonnay grapes.Fortified wines have been augmented by wine-baseddistilled beverages to raise their alcohol content toabout 20%. They may be either sweet or dry. Thebest known examples are:' Madeira, named after an island off the coast ofPortugal; usually served after a meal or as adessert wine' Port is a fortified sweet, red wine named after thePortuguese city of Oporto. It is usually drunk afterdinner. There are also brown and white versionsavailable.' sherry, made from white palomino grapes andnamed after Jerez (Xeres) de la Frontera, a townin southern Spain. Sherries range from very dry tovery sweet.Vermouth is a wine to which aromatic herbs havebeen added. The name comes from the German wordfor wormseed (wermut), one of the original flavorings.VARIETALS. I mentioned earlier that there werethousands of cultivars of Vitis vinifera. A few of them,called the \"noble grapes,\" produce the world's bestwines.-122-White Noble Grapes (White Wines):Chardonnay, makes champagne and our best whitewines in California, the Pacific Northwest, and NewYork;Chenin blanc, makes both dry and sweet wines;Gewurtztraminer, produces a highly scented wine;Riesling, also yields a highly scented grape thatproduces Germany's finest wines, and its best sweetwines when infected by the noble rot;Semillon, when infected with the noble rot, yieldssweet white wines of the Bordeaux region of France.Black Noble Grapes (Red Wines):Cabernet Sauvignon, yields wines that are high inacidity and tannins and that are long-lived;Gamay, from the Beaujolais district of Burgundy inFrance, produces wines highly regarded for theirfresh, fruity flavors;Grenache, a black grape that does well in hotclimates of France, Spain, North Africa, and California;Merlot, from the Bordeaux region of France, producesa robust, long-lived wine;Pinot noir, yields fine red burgundies; andSyrah, which produces a robust red wine.Other grapes of note include: barbera, made from anItalian black grape; catawba, a black grape native toNorth America; colombard, a white grape used inCalifornia to make French colombard and, in France,to make some cognac; Concord, a black grape nativeto North America used to make both a dry wine and asweet kosher wine; lambrusco, an Italian blackgrape; mission, the first European grape introducedinto the New World and the main one used inCalifornia until the late-1800's; petite sirah, a blackgrape introduced into California from France;sylvaner, a white grape grown in Germany and inCalifornia; and zinfandel, a black grape, possiblyfrom Italy, now planted in California where it yieldsfruity, red wines.PROCESSINGWhile the process of wine-making is relatively easy toexplain, there is a great deal of art and sciencerequired to produce really top quality wines. Thejuices of the grape are squeezed out (expressed) bylarge machines (by foot in the olden days) to form themust. It is then inoculated with a particular strain ofyeast, Saccharomyces ellipsoideus. Fermentationbegins and it will continue until the alcohol contentreaches 10-14%, at which time the yeasts are killedby their own metabolic products. The must may betreated with sulfur dioxide or pasteurized to killunwanted micro-organisms that could spoil thedelicate flavor that is desired. Initial fermentationcontinues for several days, during which various solidssettle and chemical changes occur. The conversion ofgrape sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide alsogenerates heat. It and the alcohol itself begin to breakdown the grape skins. Tannins in the skin are of greatimportance in the production of many of the redwines. The stem of the grape is another source of thesetannins. Grapes may be fermented with the stemsintact, partially removed, or completely absent. Todaythere are machines that stem and crush the grapes,thereby allowing the skins and juices to be pumpedinto vats and the stems to be discarded. Vats aremade of wood, concrete, or stainless steel. If thegrape skins remain in the must, the result is a redwine. Many of them are named after the areas wherethey were first developed or they are associated withthe wine industry of a particular country. Somecommon examples of red wines are Burgandy, claret,Chianti, Cabernet, and zinfandel. If the skins are not allowed to remain on the grapesduring fermentation, a white wine will result. Whilethe skins may be left on long enough to impart somecolor and flavor, the juices will lack the tannin contentof red wines. These tannins inhibit the growth ofbacteria. Sulfur dioxide is used in its place. Whitewines are typically fermented at lower temperaturesthan are red wines. Common examples includeChardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Riesling, Tokay,Chablis, champagne, sauterne, and white burgundy.Rose wines are made by leaving the grape skins in themust for a short period of time and then removingthem. Really cheap rose wines may be mixtures of redand white wines.The high malic acid content of new wine can bereduced by a secondary fermentation or malolacticfermentation. The process is mediated by selectstrains of yeast. It is used extensively in theprocessing of California chardonnays. Better wines are then aged in wood for a period ofabout six months to several years. The casks aretypically made of oak and hold 225-228 liters (about60 gallons). Alcohol and water diffuse into the woodand then evaporate. These processes concentrate thewine at the same time that a number of highlycomplex biochemical changes are occurring. Duringmaturation, wine is decanted from one vessel toanother. Racking, as it is known in the trade, allowsa clear liquid to be drawn off and for the lees (deadyeasts, tartar crystals, small pieces of grape skin, andother solids) to remain behind. Wines may alsoundergo clarification or fining. This process alsoremoves microscopic solids. They coagulate aroundfining substances, such as egg white, gelatin, orbentonite, a kind of clay.WINE MAKINGHarvest grapesLCrushLRemove skins/seeds(white wine)LSqueeze our juices to form mustLAdd yeast, sugar, & sulfur dioxideLFermentLRemove skins/seeds(red wine)LDraw off liquid (rack)LClarify (fining)LAge in wooden barrelL-123-FilterLBottleLSell at an extravagant price FERMENTED BEVERAGESBeverage Plant Source Part UsedArrack (arak) Date (Phoenix dactylifera) FruitsBeer Many plant sources Grains, bractsChicha Various plants Grains, seedsCider Apple (Malus spp.) FruitsGinger beer Ginger (Zingiber spp.) RhizomesKava (yangona) Kava (Piper methysticum) Roots, etc.Kvass (quass) Cereals + mint (Mentha spp.) Grains, leavesPalm wine Various palms Stem apexPombe Millet (Eleusine spp.) GrainsPulque Maguey (Agave spp.) Stem apexRoot beer Several aromatic plants Leaves, bark, rootsSaki (sake) Rice (Oryza sativa) GrainsSorgo Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) GrainsWine Grapes (Vitis vinifera + Vitis spp.) Fruits7.4 ! ALCOHOLICBEVERAGES (DISTILLED)\"There's no such thing as bad whiskey. Somewhiskeys just happen to be better than others.\" [William Faulkner]' ' ' ' 'We have not been satisfied with the modest 14%alcohol content afforded us by the natural processesof fermentation by microorganisms. We have evidencethat the ancient Egyptians and Greeks knew ofmethods to increase the alcohol content of a liquid.Aristotle wrote of making seawater drinkable by adistilling process and suggested that it could also beused with wines and beers.DISTILLATIONSometime during the late Middle Ages, the Arabs orthe Saracens perfected the process by which thepercentage of ethyl alcohol in a fermented drink couldbe increased by a process called distillation.The principle of distillation rests on a very simple fact.Alcohol vaporizes (changes from a liquid to a gas) at173E F and water vaporizes at 212E F. Therefore if youheat an alcohol + water mixture to just below theboiling point of water, the alcohol will turn to a gas,escape, leaving the water behind in its liquid state. Ifyou were to cook a beer mash or wine in an open pot,the alcohol would simply escape into the atmosphere.We do not want that to happen."
