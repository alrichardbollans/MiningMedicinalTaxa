      "text": "The classifi cation decisions of products would have to be based on evaluation of the pharmacological properties of the product. Products would not automatically be classifi ed as herbal medicinal products just because emblic leaffl ower and barbary wolfberry are known medicinal plants. Again, the dosage is important. If medicinal plants are present in quantities possessing 'pharmacological effects', products will likely be considered as medicines.Besides through medicinal function, presenting medicinal claims is the other route for our products to achieve medicinal status. As stated above, medicinal claims are of the type \"for prevention of diabetes\" and \"for heart conditions\". Mention of the metabolic syndrome would also constitute a medicinal claim.1470 Finnish Medicines Act section 3(3).1471 Medicinal products directive, Article 2(2).1472 Crataegus laevigata, Crataegus monogyna and Crataegus oxycantha are the species used in Europe and they are different from the Chinese hawthorn (Crataegus pinnatifi da). Dharmananda. 1473 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.laakelaitos.fi /uploads/Laaketeollisuus/Rohdokset/Rohdosluettelo_2006_2_28.pdf.-268-6.4.2 ChinaIn China, foodstuffs and medicines are traditionally seen as substances from the same source. Many herbs can be sold either as health foods or traditional Chinese Medicines. This is the case for our berries: all three berries are on the market both as food and as herbal medicines. If we want to develop functional food products to the Chinese market, there is legally room for different types of products made of the three berries. The two basic legal alternatives are health foods and traditional Chinese medicine.Chinese legislation separates foodstuffs and medicines based on product functions. Health foods form the relatively clearly defi ned borderline category between regular foods and medicines. 'Health foods' category is suitable for products that:possess the general nature of food, -can regulate bodily functions of certain consumer groups, but -are not intended for therapeutic purposes. -The Health Food Regulation establishes 27 possible health-related functions for health foods, including regulation of blood pressure, regulation of blood lipids, and regulation of blood sugars. These are the health claims also available to marketers. The health foods category is suitable for us as we are functional food developers fi ghting the metabolic syndrome. If we were interested, for example, in cancer risk reduction, the health food category would not be available. The application for health food registration is sent to the SFDA, and several different research reports on safety, effi cacy and quality of the product are required.Traditional medicines, on the other hand, are plant-based medicines, sold for a therapeutic purpose, to prevent or treat a disease. For these, an application to the SFDA is necessary. Traditional medicines are evaluated according to the Medicine Administration Law.6.5 General Safety RequirementsGeneral safety requirements for consumer products, and foodstuffs and medicines in particular, were discussed above in chapter 4.6.5.1 EUAccording to general rules on product safety, it is illegal to sell unsafe products to consumers including products that are hazardous and products on which the consumer is not given enough information to enable safe use.European food safety requirements are strict. Foods must not be dangerous to a person's health. Besides short-term health effects, also long-term health effects, cumulative health effects and effects on subsequent generations are taken into account when determining safety criteria. The precautionary principle guides the risk analysis.General requirements applicable to all foods include biological safety and chemical safety. Biological safety is guaranteed by hygiene rules. In Europe, the separate hygiene rules for -269-different types of products, for example meat, eggs and milk, were recently codifi ed into one single Regulation. Chemical safety of foods is guaranteed by regulating residues, contaminants, additives, and food contact materials. GMO foods have their own authorisation procedure.Functional foods are sometimes fortifi ed by vitamins and minerals. Here one must follow the EU Regulation on food fortifi cation. With regard to substances other than vitamins and minerals, national rules on fortifi cation apply. The Regulation on food supplements gives the rules on allowed vitamins and minerals in these products. In the future, the Regulation on food supplements will probably also cover other substances than vitamins and minerals, for example herbals. Until that time, national rules on food supplements apply. If one wants to sell the product as a dietetic food, particular compositional and quality criteria are given in specifi c directives.Medicine safety is evaluated concurrently with effi cacy. Potential risks must be outweighed by therapeutic effi cacy. Safety of medicines is guaranteed by procedural requirements relating to tests and trials that have to be performed and documented before authorisation is granted. There are simplifi ed procedures for certain medicines that are considered safe and effective without a need to provide a complete dossier of documents.With new chemical and herbal medicines, the application must include a complete dossier of documents. This dossier contains information on the results of physico-chemical, biological or microbiological, pharmacological and toxicological tests.Applications can also be based on:essential similarity to existing medicines, or -scientifi c literature to prove a - well-established medicinal use with recognised effi cacy and an acceptable level of safety.Applications on traditional herbal medicines can also be based on a history of safe use. The required 'history' is defi ned as 30 years of use, of which 15 years within the European Community area.Homeopathic medicines can be authorised via the primary procedure just like other medicines. There is also a simplifi ed procedure for homeopathic medicines that bear no therapeutic indication and are suffi ciently diluted to make them harmless. With herbal medicines, lowering the dose will make the product a food; in homeopathy it will make the product eligible for simple registration as a medicinal product. Because of different cultural traditions, the simplifi ed procedure does not exist in all the EU Member States.6.5.2 ChinaThe Chinese food safety legislation consists of similar pieces of law as its European counterpart. Both biological and chemical safety is regulated. Food hygiene is regulated nationally through the Food Safety Law. In addition, there are separate decrees giving specifi c hygiene rules on food irradiation, meat and meat products, milk and milk products, eggs and egg products, aquatic products, condiments, sugar, alcohol, grain, edible vegetable oil, tea, edible mushrooms, street food, student food etc.1474. Local authorities issue the food hygiene 1474 Kan - Zhang 2002.-270-licenses to manufacturers and sellers1475. Also day-to-day control of food hygiene is under the competence of local authorities. This is why hygiene rules in practice vary in different parts of China.Chemical safety is the goal of regulations on food additives, environmental contaminants, pesticide residues, hormones and antibiotics residues, food contact materials etc1476. GMO legislation is also in place. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has established the pollution-free-program and the green program to produce food without harmful chemicals. However, these programs are not yet commonly followed.According to general rules on medicine safety, the sale of fake medicines and medicines of inferior quality is prohibited. With modern medicines, safety is based on pre-clinical and clinical trials. With traditional medicines, safety evaluation is often based on long tradition of use. However, the safety approach to traditional medicines is similar to that of modern medicines: all medicines are recognised to have side effects, a risk-benefi t ratio is applied, and appropriate dosage is an integral part of treatment.6.6 Particular Safety Criteria of Novel FoodsFunctional foods often have new ingredients the use of which might involve new types of health hazards. The safety of a functional food will in these cases have to be evaluated pre-market according to novel food legislation. We need to consider whether our berry products (if considered foods, not medicines); would be considered novel foods, and if so, -what would be the procedure to determine their safety, and -whether they would be authorised as legal novel foods. -These questions are evaluated based on novel food regulations and literature1477, and in comparison to existing novel food products.6.6.1 Current EU Novel Food Regulation6.6.1.1 Would berries be considered novel?In the EU, a food that has not been marketed to a signifi cant degree before May 1997 is considered novel. Novel foods must go through the pre-market authorisation procedure, where an application is fi rst sent to a Member State, and where all EU Member States thereafter have their say on whether the food should be authorised. A simplifi ed procedure (notifi cation) is available to those novel foods that are substantially equivalent to existing foods.1475 Food safety authorities in provinces, autonomous areas, and municipalities directly under the central government.1476 Kan - Zhang 2002.1477 Discussed above in chapter 4.2.-271-It is evident that hawthorn berries are not novel foods as the plant has been commonly used as food in Europe for decades. It is now used as a food supplement1478 and as regular food1479.We have a recent opinion on the novelty of barbary wolfberry by the UK's Food Standard Agency (FSA). According to the FSA, consumption of Lycium barbarum (Chinese wolfberry, goji berry) has been signifi cant for many years, and more importantly, before May 1997. Therefore the berry does not need to be authorised as a novel food. The FSA started seeking evidence of goji consumption in February 2007. According to initial reports, no signifi cant history of consumption before 1997 was evident. This would have resulted in the requirement of the fruit to be authorised as a novel food. Products containing wolfberries are at the moment being sold on the UK market.1480With emblic leaffl ower fruit, the situation is more diffi cult. We can fi rst take a look at other plant-based foods that have been considered novel. The three plant-based novel foods that have gone through the authorisation procedure are: Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, Nangai nuts, and Noni fruit1481. Among the notifi ed novel foods, there are for example prune kernel oil and argan oil. All of these were not novel foods as such, as they had signifi cant history of food use outside Europe, but apparently no history of food use in Europe was found.Basically, the marketer must know whether his product is novel. It is illegal to market novel foods without authorisation. If the marketer is not sure of novelty, they can search the European market themselves, and ask for guidance from the national food safety authority of their EU Member State. If a novel food application is made, the food safety authorities will perform a literature search and a fi eld study to determine whether the food is in fact novel.We have superfi cially searched through literature and the Internet and not found European food use of emblic leaffl ower. We thus predict that emblic leaffl ower fruit as a functional food ingredient would indeed be considered a novel food in Europe.6.6.1.2 Would the berries be eligible for the simplifi ed procedure?According to the current novel food regulation, certain novel foods or novel food ingredients may follow a simplifi ed procedure, which only requires notifi cation from the company. This is when the foods are considered (by a national food assessment body) as \"substantially equivalent\" to existing foods or food ingredients. This assessment of substantial equivalence is based on the composition, nutritional value, metabolism, intended use, and the level of undesirable substances contained in the food. If considered novel, we must consider whether the three berries would be eligible for the simplifi ed procedure, or whether they would need authorisation according to the principal procedure.So far (September 2006), around 70 notifi cations on novel foods have been made. This means that these 70 products were regarded as novel, but essentially similar to existing foods. 1478 For example the Finnish herbal company Frantsila and the Swedish herbal company Ortagubben use hawthorn in food supplements: http://www.frantsila.com/m-tuotteet-yrttiuutteet.htm, http://ortagubben.jetshop.se/default.aspx.1479 This can be inferred from various marmalade recipes on European homepages, for example http://kerkka.vuodatus.net/blog/archive?m=09&y=2006, http://www.recepthjalpen.se/hagtorn.html.1480 Nutraingredient.com Europe News Headlines 18/06/2007. 1481 The details of the authorisation processes for these three foods will be discussed below.-272-Of these, around 30 concerned noni fruit. In addition, there were notifi cations on prune kernel oil and argan oil. Prune kernel oil, huile d'amandon de pruneau, was notifi ed in July 2000. Argan oil (Argania spinosa L.) was notifi ed fi rst in July 2002 and subsequently in 2005 and 2006. Other novel foods notifi ed were a vitamin, a fungus, a couple algae, and around 30 products with added phytosterols or phytostanols often by companies extending their cholesterol-lowering product lines.1482Noni juice was already mentioned above. After it received authorisation in 2002, several people and companies have notifi ed it. A German fi rst notifi ed it in November 2003. Subsequently, several German, French, Danish, and Dutch actors have notifi ed it. All of the notifi cations were based on an assessment by national food agency that the product in question is similar to the original noni juice authorised as novel food.1483In the previous chapter, we concluded that hawthorn and barbary wolfberry would not be considered novel in Europe. To be eligible for the simplifi ed procedure, emblic leaffl ower fruit would need to be considered substantially equivalent to some other berry. So far, notifi cation process has been used only to bring to market the same fruit (noni) that has already been authorised through the primary procedure. We thus predict that emblic leaffl ower fruit would not be considered equivalent to any other berry.6.6.1.3 Would the berries be authorised?If considered novel and not eligible for the simplifi ed procedure, we must predict whether our functional food products would be authorised in the primary procedure for novel food safety evaluation. According to the law, a novel food can be authorised if it is safe for consumers to use. Novel food assessment integrates nutritional and toxicological aspects: nutritional properties of the food and the predicted dietary exposure affect the toxicological testing programme. Besides science, novel food evaluation is in practice also affected by different cultures and different political interests of EU Member States. According to exotic food producers, the safety requirements for novel foods are so strict that for example wheat, potatoes and green leafy vegetables would not be accepted if now introduced in Europe.Based on the current legislation, only one novel food product that even resembles berry-based products has been authorised: the noni juice. Two plant-based novel foods have been rejected. These are Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni1484 and Nangai nuts (Canaria indicum L.)1485 It is noteworthy, that of the three novel foods rejected since 1997, two were plant products. All the products containing stanols or sterols have been authorised. Currently novel food safety requirements concerning so-called exotic plants are strictly interpreted in Europe, and producers of these plants are demanding some relief to these requirements.1482 European Commission web page at: http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/novelfood/notif_list_en.pdf.1483 European Commission web page at: http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/novelfood/notif_list_en.pdf.1484 Commission Decision 2000/196/EC.1485 Commission Decision 2001/17/EC.-273-Stevia caseThe Commission's Scientifi c Committee on Food gave its opinion1486 on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni in June 1999. Information on the chemical composition of the plant leaves was available to the Committee. The leaves contain a complex mixture of natural sweet chemicals, the main sweet principle being stevioside.1487 There was data showing stevioside is not toxic. The Committee also knew the plant in question is a traditional American natural sweetener used for centuries. It has been added to herbal teas and other beverages.1488 They also knew that the plant was cultivated in several American and Asian countries, as well as in Europe1489. Botanically, the plant was well identifi ed1490. There were no particular technological processes involved, only drying1491 and thus it is safe to say that using the plant in foods was not a discovery of any kind.In Paraguay, the plant had since the 50s been administered to diabetics to reduce blood sugar levels. The applicant had also provided results of one animal test proving this kind of benefi ts to diabetics. According to the applicant, a signifi cant decrease in liver glycogen after 2 weeks and a signifi cant decrease in blood glucose levels after 4 weeks were showing in the rat test. The Committee did not consider this animal test convincing, as they did not have the details of the study.1492 The dry powder was intended to replace some of the sucrose in drinks, jams and sweets to reduce the caloric intake. Besides diabetics, the product was also considered good for obese individuals.The Committee would have wanted more information, though. They would have liked the product to be carefully analysed, and the composition standardised, preferably with regard to stevioside. The producer should have known where the plants are cultivated, which variety of the species will be used, and what the composition of commercial products is. Also toxicological tests on the fi nal products should have been helpful, even though nothing inherently toxic is present in the plant. Also microbiological issues should have been addressed in the application.1493 The appropriate intake was also unclear to the Committee. There were also no studies to show the physiological and pharmacological effects of substituting sugar with Stevia rebaudiana in diabetic or obese individuals.1494 There were also no studies on how the use of the plant might affect absorption of other food.1495 The list continuing, no investigations on the allergenic potential of the leaves and the powdered leaves were submitted.14961486 Opinion on Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni plants and dried leaves.
