Theseeds contain 1-1.5% caffeine, not as much as in tealeaves. An essential oil, caffeol, imparts thecharacteristic aroma and flavor. Coffee seeds alsocontain glucose, dextrins, and various proteins.DECAFFEINATIONMaking decaffeinated coffee begins with unroastedbeans that are steam-softened. They are then flushedwith a solvent for about an hour. Until the mid-1970'strichloroethylene was used; now it is methylenechloride or ethyl acetate. The solvent is drained awayand the beans are steamed to evaporate the residue.This phase may be repeated as many as 24 times. Thefinal product is about 97% caffeine-free (0.08% vs.1.0-2.0%).KINDS OF COFFEE PREPARATIONSSome people have suggested that we blame Frasierand Niles Crane for the increased interest in exotic,yuppie kinds of coffee. Especially here along thePacific Coast, we have many opportunities to samplethem.Espresso is a strong, dark-roast coffee that is brewedunder pressure.Cappuccino is an Italian espresso coffee that istopped with steamed, foamed milk. Some of the milkis mixed into the coffee. Cocoa or cinnamon is oftenadded to the foam.Cafe latte is similar to cappuccino, except that thesteamed and foamed milk is mixed throughout. Cafe au lait is made from a strong coffee orespresso; it is about half coffee and half milk. Cafe mocha is cafe latte with chocolate added.Cafe con leche is a very strong black coffee to whichhot milk is added.Cafe amaretto is a black coffee that is flavored withamaretto, cloves, citrus rinds, and cinnamon.Cafe brulot is a black coffee that is flavored withsugar, citrus rinds, cloves, cinnamon, and brandy. Itis set on fire and allowed to flame briefly. Look for itin New Orleans.Cafe macchiato is an espresso with just a dollop ofsteamed milk foam on the topCafe Normande is black coffee flavored by Calvados,an apple brandy from Calvados, Normandy.Cafe royale is like a cafe brulot, but it is not set onfire. It may also be bourbon- and sugar-flavoredcoffee.-117-By the way, cafe is the French, Spanish, andPortuguese word for coffee and the place where it issold is called a cafeteria.COFFEE AND YOUR HEALTHIs coffee good for you? Certainly it can be drunk toexcess. What about more moderate consumption -two to four cups a day? Below is an attempt tosummarize recent studies, which often seem tocontradict one another.Too much coffee may cause:1986: Phobias, panic attacks1990: Heart attacks, stress, osteoporosis1991: Underweight babies, hypertension1992: Higher cholesterol1993: Miscarriages1994: Intensified stress1995: Delayed conception2000: ArthritisCoffee may also help prevent or treat:1988: Asthma1990 Colon and rectal cancer, impotence1992 Mental sluggishness, heart disease(instant only)1996 Fatal car accidents, suicide1999 Gallstones, heart disease2000 Parkinson's DiseaseSource: Time Magazine: 05 June 2000CACAO\"The divine drink which builds up resistance and fightsfatigue. A cup of this precious drink permits a man towalk for a whole day without food. \"[Hernan Cortes]\"This cacao, when much is drunk, when much isconsumed, especially that which is green, ... makesone drunk,... dizzy, confuses one, makes one sick,deranges one. When an ordinary amount is drunk, itgladdens one, refreshes one, consoles one, in-vigorates one. Thus it is said: 'I take cacao. I wet mylips. I refresh myself. \"[Bernardino de Sahagun, 16th century]\"The beverage of the gods was ambrosia; that of manis chocolate. Both increase the length of life in aprodigious manner. \"[Louis Lewin, \"Phantastica\"]' ' ' ' 'First, a word about easily confused common names.The plant itself is a cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). Byprocessing its seeds, we obtain products that we callcocoa and chocolate. The South American shrub thatbears the coca leaf, the source of cocaine, is acompletely unrelated plant.Cacao is a small tree native to the New World tropics.The Aztecs made a drink from it called xocoatl; theMayans made kakaw. These were very popular drinkslong before the Conquest. They also used it as amoney substitute. The usual Aztec recipe called forcacao, maize, water, and capsicums. The maize wasused because the cacao seeds contained so much fat.This concoction was relatively unpalatable to theSpaniards. It was not until the Dutch broke a virtualSpanish monopoly that cacao even became known tomost Europeans. Cacao did not become popular inEurope until someone discovered that it could beimproved by adding sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla.PROCESSINGProcessing of cacao begins with the harvesting of thefruits. This is done by hand. The fruits are often splitopen immediately and the seeds removed. The seedsare then fermented, either by placing them in largepiles in the open, or by putting them in specialfermentation tanks. This process helps to removepulpy material from around the seeds. They are thenwashed, dried, and packaged for export. Finalprocessing usually occurs in the U.S. or Europe. Thisconsists of the seeds being cracked open and themeat expressed to yield the oils and fats, the cocoabutter. It is used in everything from suntan lotions tohemorrhoid medicines. The remaining cake is thesource of commercial chocolate. Cacao seeds containtheobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine), an alkaloidrelated to caffeine.Today West Africa is the leading cacao productioncenter. Ghana produces about 35% of the world'ssupply; Nigeria about 14%. The United States andUnited Kingdom use about half.The chocolate industry was helped considerably bytwo discoveries. In 1828 C. J. van Houten discoveredthe process for removing the excess fat from seeds. In1876, M. D. Peter of Switzerland formulated milkchocolate by adding dried milk.Initial Processing:Extract seedsLFermentLClean/dry seedsLRoast (121E C)LSeparate nibs from shellsLGrindLCake + liquorLSecond grindLPressLCocoa butter + cakeFinal Processing:Option 1:Cocoa butterLAdd liquor and sugarLConchLSweet chocolateOption 2:Cocoa butterLAdd liquor, sugar, milk solidsLConch-118-LMilk chocolateOption 3:Cocoa cakeLPulverizeLCocoa powderCOLA BEVERAGESCola nitida is a tree native to the rain forests of Africa.Its seeds contain caffeine (up to 3.5%), theobromine(less than 1%), and kolanin, a glycoside. Cola nutextracts were once used to flavor the various coladrinks. Now most of these use flavorings,theobromine, and caffeine from other sources. Most ofthe cola nuts are produced in Africa and Jamaica.While the chewing of coca leaves never becamepopular in Europe and North America, various drinkswith coca leaf extracts did. John Styth Pemberton wasa pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia. He was also a CivilWar veteran who had become addicted to morphine,as had so many of his compatriots. Pemberton wasaware of the research that indicated that cocainecould cure morphine addiction and that it had otherhealthful properties. Earlier he had concocted a seriesof patent medicines with colorful names, such asTriplex Liver Pills, Globe Flower Cough Syrup, IndianQueen Hair Dye, and my personal favorite, BotanicBlood Balm.Noting the success of Vin Mariani (see the discussionof cocaine), Pemberton formulated a drink calledFrench Wine Coca, which he described as \"an idealtonic and stimulant.\" He placed it on the market in1881. He claimed that it cured addiction to opiates,was effective in the treatment of alcoholism, and wasdrunk by thousands of the world's leading scientists.What a testimonial! In 1885 the good citizens ofAtlanta voted to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages,which meant that Pemberton's coca-fortified wine wasnow illegal. He came up with a new recipe that wasalcohol-free. His accountant, Frank Robinson,suggested that he name the new beverage after itstwo exotic ingredients - coca leaf and the kola nut.With a little bit of purposeful creative misspelling,Coca Cola was born. In 1891, Pemberton sold hisrights and the secret recipe to Asa Griggs Chandler for$2300. Coca Cola also has a less well known reputation. Thecompany itself claimed that it was \"a most wonderfulinvigorator of the sexual organs,\" which led to astrange trial in 1909 when the government chargedthat the drink caused young boys to masturbate. Itwas also popular with young women who picked up onthe rumor that Coca Cola, when used as a doucheafter intercourse, was an effective spermicide. Thescientific literature on cocaine as an aphrodisiac ismurky. Its ability to kill sperm has not beendemonstrated.Modern day Coca Cola does not contain cocaine, butit still has coca leaf flavoring in it. A plant in NewJersey, run by a subsidiary of Coca Cola, processesabout 175,000 kg of the trujillo coca leaf each year toremove its cocaine. They refer to the leaves as\"Merchandise No. 5\" (Streatfeild, 2001). You mayrecall that in the 1980's, we saw a new version ofCoke for sale, but that it failed and it was replaced by\"Classic Coke.\" The recipe that failed had no coca leafflavoring in it.MINOR CAFFEINATEDBEVERAGESMATE. Ilex paraguariensis, also called yerba mate andJesuit tea, is a shrub related to English holly. It isprobably the world's 4th most popular drink. It is verywidely used in South America, where it is native. Theleaves contain about 1.5% caffeine. Mate is becomingmore popular in the U.S.GUARANA. This is the \"Brazilian cocoa\" or the \"cola\"of Brazil. Paullinia cupana is a twining shrub that haslong been used by the local Indians. It has 3-4 timesmore caffeine than either tea or coffee. In recentyears it has found its way into North Americanmarkets, often as one of the ingredients in beveragesthat health-conscious folks drink.7.3 ! ALCOHOLICBEVERAGES(FERMENTED)The use of beverages containing alcohol has alwaysbeen part of our culture. In addition to the verycommon social aspects of drinking alcoholicbeverages, we have also used them in a ceremonialand religious context. We first encountered alcoholperhaps through the accidental discovery of naturallyfermented substances. The fact that yeast wasnecessary for these natural processes to occur musthave been appreciated early on. It has beensuggested by some authors that yeast was our firstcultivated plant.THE PLAYERSOrganism Where Used?Aspergillus oryzeae Sake, miso, soy sauceAspergillus soyae Soy sauceSaccharomyces cerevisiae Beer/breadSaccharomyces carlsburgensis BeerSaccharomyces ellipsoideus WineSaccharomyces sake SakeSaccharomyces exiguis BreadSaccharomyces beticus Fino sherriesSaccharomyces theobromae CacaoLeuconostoc mesenteroides SauerkrautLactobacillus plantarum SauerkrautLactobacillus sanfrancisco Sour dough breadFERMENTATIONIn the beginning, we had only fermented beverages.Fermentation is a biochemical process by which awide variety of carbohydrate sources are acted uponby naturally occurring or cultivated strains of yeasts(Saccharomyces spp.). We use these organismsbecause they: (1) are efficient producers of alcohol,(2) can tolerate higher levels of ethanol in theirenvironment than many other fungi, and (3) alsomake other compounds that affect the taste offermented beverages. They live in an anaerobic-119-(oxygen-free) condition. Yeasts ingest sugar andnitrogenous compounds produced by other organisms.They metabolize 6-carbon simple sugars. They cannotbreak down starch directly; it must be metabolized forthem. This usually means that one or more enzymesmust be present.During fermentation, sugars are broken down intoethanol (ethyl alcohol), carbon dioxide, fusel oils(alcohols of long chain-lengths), acetaldehyde, aceticacid, and various sulfur-containing compounds. About47% of the sugar is converted into alcohol. With anunlimited supply of sugar, the alcohol level can reachabout 14-18%. In a sense, the yeasts are swimmingabout in alcohol, a waste product of their lifeprocesses. When the alcohol concentration reachesapproximately 18-19%, the yeasts are killed by it andthe fermentation process stops. This is the reason forthe comparatively low alcohol content of beer, wine,and other fermented drinks.FERMENTATION: THE RECIPE(Joseph Gay-Lussac, 1810)C6 H12 O6 u 2 C2 H5 OH + 2 CO2Sugar u ethyl alcohol + carbon dioxideMuch of our modern understanding of fermentationrests on the work of Louis Pasteur (1822-1895), theFrench chemist and bacteriologist. In a series ofexperiments, he found that: (1) grape juice will notferment into wine in the absence of yeast cells, and(2) \"... fermentation by yeast is the directconsequence of ... life.\" Pasteur trapped air-borneyeast cells so that he could examine them under themicroscope. Pasteurization is the process that hedeveloped for destroying microorganisms and therebyarresting fermentation. It involves heating milk orsome other material to about 140E F.ALCOHOL CONTENTBeverage % AlcoholFermented:Beer 3.5-6.0Ale 6.0-8.0Hard cider 8.0-12.0Wine and fortified wine 10.0-22.0Distilled:Whiskey 40.0-55.0Brandy 40.0-55.0Rum 40.0-55.0Gin 40.0-55.0Vodka 40.0-55.0[After Der Marderosian & Liberti (1988), p. 32]ALCOHOL AND ITS EFFECTS\"I have made an important discovery... alcohol, takenin sufficient quantities, produces all the effects ofintoxication.\" (Oscar Wilde, \"In Conversation\")\"An alcoholic is someone you don't like who drinks asmuch as you do.\" (Dyan Thomas)\"Alcohol ... enables Parliament to do things at 11 atnight that no sane person would do at 11 in themorning.\" (George Bernard Shaw)' ' ' ' 'Alcohol is a non-selective depressant of the centralnervous system. At first, it has a slightly stimulatingeffect, but this is followed by a much more prolongeddulling of the senses. In low to moderate doses, thereis little evidence of long lasting, harmful effects. Whatconstitutes \"low to moderate\" remains a matter ofdebate. Several experts have spoken of the efficacy ofone or two glasses of red wine per day.Ethanol is soluble in water and fats. It moves easilythrough membranes. Almost all of the alcohol that weimbibe is absorbed in our stomach and large intestine.Typically we drink alcohol faster than our system canbreak it down to carbon dioxide and water. Thealcohol levels in our body simply rise. This leads to afeeling of general numbness, which we perceive as asense of relaxation.Drinking can produce disorientation, reducedjudgmental ability, and loss of reasoning. It can alsolead to permanent physical damage characterized by:' lowering of the body's resistance to disease(especially tuberculosis);' a progressive destruction of liver tissue andaccompanying formation of sclerotic tissue(cirrhosis of the liver); hepatic coma;' nervous complications;' physical and psychological dependence; and' an increased chance of having a stroke.The recently described \"fetal alcohol syndrome\" high-lights the effects of alcohol on the developing youngof women who drink during their pregnancies. Therecan be little doubt that alcohol is a drug -- a legal one.BEER\"A meal of bread, cheese and beer constitutes thechemically perfect food.\" [Queen Elizabeth I]\"Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to behappy.\" [Benjamin Franklin]' ' ' ' 'Beer, in the broad sense, is an alcoholic beverage thatis made by fermenting the carbohydrates found a widevariety of plants. In its simplest form:carbohydrate + water + enzymes u beerBy carbohydrates I mean the starches and sugarsfound in the roots, tubers, stems, and fruits of a longlist of plants. Enzymes are needed to break down thecarbohydrate. They occur when wild or cultivatedstrains of yeast are present. We also found out severalmillennia ago that the enzymes in our saliva will dothe trick.The brands of beer popular in this country aretypically made from a cereal as the carbohydratesource. They are also typically flavored with hops.PROCESSING OF MALTED BEERSTo prepare the malt, a cereal grain (usually barley) is -120-washed and cleaned, then steeped in vats of water forabout two days. The grains are then germinated undercontrolled conditions. This stage usually lasts four tosix days. When the primary root has emerged,germination is stopped by drying the grains in kilns.Grains are steeped in water, germinated, ground up,and dried. The result is malt. The enzymes in thesesprouted grains break down the carbohydrate materialthat is added to it."
