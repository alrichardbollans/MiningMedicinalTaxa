      "text": "We learned by trial and error thatwe could take the pollen from one plant that had itsparticular set of desirable features and place it on thestigmas of another plant that had features that alsosuited us. The object of all of this was to produceoffspring that combined the desirable features of thetwo plants. We soon discovered that only closelyrelated plants could be crossed or hybridized -- wheatwith barley, but not wheat with rice. In nature, it isthe wind, or insects, birds, bees, water, etc. thatcarries the pollen from one plant to another. Thetechniques of hybridization require that we controlpollen transfer to make certain that it is only thepollen that we want that finds its way on to thestigmatic surface of another flower. We emasculateflowers to prevent self-pollination. We hide flowersbehind netting or enclose them in bags to preventpollinators or the wind from effecting cross-pollination.When we are the agent of pollination, we use littlebrushes, sticks, or our fingers to dab pollen onreceptive stigmas. Then we cover up the flowers toprevent further, natural pollination from occurring.Many of our best known crop plants are the result ofmany generations of hybridizations and arethemselves very complex hybrids that combine thegenetic heritage of many different plant varieties.A quiet agricultural revolution began in the 1930's.Plant breeders in this country and elsewhere in theworld perfected the techniques needed to increasedramatically the yield of several of our most importantcrops, especially cereal grains. The effort was anattempt to provide higher crop yields to feed an everincreasing human population. The technology itselfwas then made available to the governments indeveloping countries where the need was acute. In1943, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexicangovernment established the Centro Internacional deMejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo (International Center forthe Improvement of Maize and Wheat).Several decades later this massive program of cropimprovement has become known as the \"GreenRevolution.\" Sugar cane, maize, wheat, rice and thesoy bean have been the major players. Yields perhectare (1 hectare = 2.471 acres) in the United Statesincreased dramatically: wheat (115%), rice (117%),maize (320%), sugar cane (141%), peanut (295%),soybeans (112%), cotton (188%), and the potato(311%).If we were to single out a particular crop and aparticular person as the \"stars\" of the GreenRevolution, they would be wheat and Norman Borlaug.By 1954, he had developed high-yielding varieties(HYV) of wheat, semi-dwarf forms with immenseyields of grain. These cultivars were also moreresistant to fungal attacks and had stems better ableto bear up under heavy applications of fertilizerswithout falling over (lodging) in wind or rain. Mexico,which had been able to meet only 1/3 of its needs forwheat, then became an exporter. Similar success wasseen in India. In recognition of his efforts, NormanBorlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. TheNobel Committee cited his technological advances thatwould make \"... it possible to abolish hunger in thedeveloping countries in the course of a few years. \"Unfortunately, this would not be the case.The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations sponsored theInternational Rice Research Institute in Los Banos, ThePhilippines. New strains matured earlier, had morethan one crop per year, and had more grains perhead.PLANT GERMPLASM CENTERSA series of agricultural research centers now existsaround the world. They are involved in the continuingprocess of crop improvement and of preservingdifferent genetic strains of particular plants. Theseunits are called germplasm centers because they storesamples of the hereditary material - the chromosomesand genes - of various crop plants. The ones that aredevoted to plant investigations are listed below.CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura) in Cali, Colombia. Beans, cassava, rice, and tropicalpasture plants.CIMMYT (Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo) in Londres, Mexico. Wheat,maize, and triticale.CIP (Centro Internacional de la Papa) in Lima, Peru. Sweet potatoes.IBPGR (International Board for Plant Genetic Resources) in Rome, Italy. A wide variety ofuseful plants.ICARDA (International Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas) in Aleppo, Syria.Barley, lentil, faba bean, durum wheat, breadwheat, and chickpeas.ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institutefor the Semi-Arid Tropics). Sorghum, millet,chickpea, pigeon pea, and groundnut.IITA (International Institute of Tropical Agriculture) in Ibaden, Nigeria. Cassava, maize,plantain, cowpea, soy bean, rice, and yams.IRRI (International Rice Research Institute) in Manila, The Phillipines. Rice.WARDA (West African Rice Development Association) in the Cote d'Ivoire. Rice.SEED BANKSThe need to maintain a collection of germplasm of ourcrops and their wild ancestors is not a new idea. N. I.Vavilov established a collection of seed samples in hislaboratory in St. Petersburg, then called Leningrad. Itstill exists. Hundreds of thousands of samplesgathered on various expeditions around the worldwere stored there. Today we call such collections seedbanks. We have 19 seed banks in this country thatcollectively form the National Plant GermplasmSystem. The main facility is in Fort Collins, Colorado.The various international research centers listedearlier in this section perform a similar function. To amuch more limited extent, certain of our largerbotanical gardens also preserve some of this geneticheritage.THE REVOLUTION THAT FAILED? \"In most developing nations, food is still grown mainlywith traditional methods; even where appropriate, thegreen revolution and its yield-boosting inputs arelargely unaffordable or unavailable to subsistencefarmers. \"[Anne & Paul Ehrlich, 1987]Even the most enthusiastic supporters of the GreenRevolution admit that it has not been an unqualified-52-success. Its harsher critics label it as a major failure.What has cast such a pall over the early optimism?To begin with, these high yield varieties require agreat deal of tender, loving care -- more water, morefertilizer, more pesticides, and more equipment toplant and to harvest them. The newer fertilizers mayrequire two or three times more nitrogen andphosphorus. There has been a three fold increase inthe use of pesticides, leading to environmentalpollution. Much more irrigation water is required.Massive irrigation projects may be needed. Aquifers,underground water supplies, become depleted. Themachinery needed for harvesting crops istechnologically advanced and expensive. Developingcountries often find themselves deeply in debt to payfor the seed, fertilizer, equipment, etc.The new cultivars are in some ways nutritionallyinferior to those planted before the Green Revolution.The protein content of Kansas wheat declined by44.7% in the period 1940-1969. Prehybrid maize had82% more crude protein; 37% more copper; 113%more manganese than current hybrids. In rice, proteincontent is down from 9-10% to 7-8%. The appearanceand taste of bread and other products made from thenew cultivars was sometimes disappointing.The Green Revolution has also favored the practice ofmonoculture, the growing of a single strain of aparticular crop year after year, and often over largeexpanses of farm land. As our plant breedingtechniques improved, it was possible to plant seed ofthese new high yielding strains that produced geneticcarbon copies of one another. It was wonderful! Theplants all looked alike, came into flower and fruit atthe same time, could be harvested at the same time,and they all had the same set of desirable features.This all sounds very positive.Our increasing reliance on the monoculturing of highyield varieties is dangerous. As the 21st centurybegins, we find ourselves dependent upon a handfulof cultivars for each of our major crops. As Levitin &McMahon (1996) point out, in the United States halfour wheat crop is derived from only nine cultivars; 4cvs. of potato account for 75% of the crop; 3 cvs.yield half of our cotton crop. In this country, we nolonger grow about 90% of the different varieties ofcrops that we grew before the Green Revolution. Thismeans that the genetic variability that was storedaway in those thousands upon thousands of cultivarsis lost to us.If we have these spiffy high-yielding varieties, why arewe concerned about losing the genes in these cultivarsthat we are not growing because they are inferior tothe HYV's? Because these traditional varieties or landraces, as they are sometimes called, are thereservoirs of the genetic heritage of the new strains.They are the source of the germplasm, the library ofthe genetic codes needed by plant breeders tomaintain, to modify, and to create new strains ofthese critical crops. Some of the first high yieldcultivars of the Green Revolution, such as IR-8 rice,have already shown signs of genetic deterioration.Only an infusion of genes from the very cultivars thatthey were to replace can save them.What if something happens to these cultivars? Thevery genetic uniformity that makes them so useful tous also makes them potentially vulnerable to disaster.If one plant of a particular cultivar is susceptible to afungal pest, then all of them will be. They aregenetically identical. This is not simply a theoreticalconcern. It has happened. In the 1840's, the potatocrop in Ireland was decimated by a fungus, the lateblight of potato. In 1892, coffee rust, another fungalinfection, wiped out the plantations in Ceylon. Themaize varieties in this country that contained the genefor cytoplasmic male sterility were hit badly by thecorn leaf blight in 1970. A bacterial infection of citrustrees in Florida killed millions of trees. New resistantcultivars were needed. Where do plant breeders go forthe genes they need? To the germplasm reservoirstored in the land races.SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTUREModern agriculture has tended to substitute: (1)continual culture of a single crop for crop rotation anddiversification; (2) herbicides and pesticides forbiological control; (3) inorganic fertilizers that must bepurchased, rather than organic ones or green manure;and (4) larger agricultural fields in place of smallerfamily farms.The perils are obvious. What do we do? One solutionhas been called \"organic farming,\" \"alternativeagriculture,\" or \"sustainable agriculture.\" The basicprinciple underlying this approach is that a plot of landhas to be seen as a small ecosystem, not as a factory.It is an ecosystem that must be maintained inbalance. The techniques include:' switch from monoculture to polyculture;' switch from annual to perennial crops;' crop rotation;' biological pest control;' working the soil to minimize erosion;' use of animal manure and green manure; and' control weeds and disease.Plant breeders are now developing perennial forms ofsorghum by crossing the annual (Sorghum bicolor)with the common Johnson grass (S. halepense), aperennial weed. Similar efforts may produce a newform of maize by crossing the annual crop (Zea mays)with a recently discovered perennial, wild teosinte(Zea diploperennis).Sustainable agriculture sounds like a return to thetechniques of long ago, but it is much more than that.For a farm to be sustainable it must produce adequateamounts of high-quality food, it must beenvironmentally safe, and it may even turn a profit.Such enterprises must minimize what they purchaseexternally and rely upon the renewable resources ofthe farm itself. About 90% of the farms that practicethese alternative methods are in poorer parts ofworld.4.3 !

The pollen grains had in themnot only the genes for the desirable feature, but manyothers as well. We may not want them. Thetechniques were also laborious and time consuming.What plant breeders wanted was the ability to produceoffspring that combined specific traits. Once ourunderstanding of basic genetics was in place, webegan to realize that someday we ought to be able tocontrol reproduction in plants -- to produce carboncopies of plants that had we found useful to us or totransfer specific genes from one plant to another. Wenow have a series of new techniques at our disposal toaccomplish exactly those goals.CLONING. The term comes from the Greek word fortwig. In this procedure, we use individual cells from aplant with desirable features to produce whole plantswith the those traits. These are the \"twigs\" of theparent plant. The process involves:Removing tissue from plantLSeparating cells from one anotherLDissolving cell wallsL-54-Putting cells in nutrient solutionLCells clumping together to form callus tissueLNurturing callus tissue into adult plantsPROTOPLAST FUSION. The cell membrane and allthat is inside it is a protoplast. In protoplast fusion,we create new forms by combining cells from differentplants and then regenerating a hybrid from the fusedcells. The result is a somatic hybrid. Protoplastfusion occurs naturally or it can be induced bytreatment with electrical shock or with certainchemicals, such as polyethylene glycol. One gram ofplant tissue may contain as many as 4 millionprotoplasts that are capable of maturing into adultplants, either one their own or after being fused withother cells. Sometimes the results are adisappointment."
