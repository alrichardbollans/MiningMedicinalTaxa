The microbial testing is performed on the selected surface of the equipment in order to determine the number of colony forming units (CFUs) present. Analysts from Quality Control Department will per-form the analysis on the swab and/or rinse samples. The results are reported in Quality Assurance Department and the Quality Assurance Manager will give final approval to the reviewed results by signing the final Report (Haider and Asif, 2010b). Validated cleaning process must be subject to change control. Further, revalidation is necessary in order to main-tain the validated status where a differentiation must be made between change-related and periodic revalidation. An effi-cient change control procedure must ensure that the effect of changes on the cleaning validation is identified and that any necessary follow-up action is initiated. Checks must be car-ried-out to verify whether revalidation is necessary follow-ing changes to the cleaning procedure, production equipment and products. A suitable time interval must be determined for the periodic revalidation. Implementation may be stream-lined by linking this to the change control procedure and by reducing the scope of the validation based on a review of data and documents (Borchert and Gomez, 2011b).ConclusionCleaning procedures should be suitable for their in-tended purpose. This should be confirmed by the success-ful execution of a cleaning validation study. The clean-ing validation must ensure that the quality of the product produced using specified equipment is not influenced by cross-contamination from the previous product, cleaning agent's residues or microorganisms.ReferencesBorchert, D., Gomez, R., 2011a.

D., Blvd. A. Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* anosacheva@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionMost people nowadays suffer from problems with the gastrointestinal tract and indigestion. Gastroguard chew-able tablets are a pharmaceutical solid dosage form from the group of antacids, which contains 680 mg calcium car-bonate and 80 mg magnesium carbonate. Its effect is to act locally and neutralize the gastric acid in the stomach, not depending on the systemic absorption. Therefore it al-leviates the symptoms caused by indigestion and releases the feeling of bloating. The carbonate salts react with the gastric acid in the stomach developing water and miner-al salts as products (http://www.alkaloid.com.mk/vademe-cum-step-2.nspx?LekTipId=150). Every pharmaceutical product must be subjected to chemical and microbiological analysis before the batch release. Those analyses are under the jurisdiction of the Quality Control department. In addition to the microbio-logical analysis a working method for determination of the microbiological purity in this pharmaceutical solid form, which would be used in the routine, must be validated. For pharmaceutical solid forms the parameters that should be tested are Total Aerobic Microbial Count (TAMC), Total Yeasts and Molds Count (TYMC) and absence of Esche-richia coli (Ph.Eur., 2013; USP, 2014).The aim of this work is to validate the analytical meth-od which would be used in the routine work for determina-tion of the microbiological purity of Gastoguard chewable tablets as part of the quality control of the product before releasing of the batch. The method should be simple for manipulation and in compliance with the current Europe-an Pharmacopeia. The validation of the method was made by the microbiological team of the Quality Control depart-ment of Alkaloid AD.Materials and methodMaterialsDuring validation of the method standard laborato-ry equipment was used: Laminar flow Class II, Incubators Gallencamp on 20-25 oC; 30-35 oC and 42-44 oC, Bunsen burner, Vortex, glass pipetes, glass tubes intended for mi-crobiological use. In addition to validate the method 10g of Gastoguard chewable tablets were weighted using Sartori-us analytical scale. Buffered sodium chloride peptone wa-ter pH 7 was utilized as medium for dissolving of the sam-ple and for making the dilutions of the culture suspensions. Ready to use nutrient media from BioMerieux were used. 90 mm Petri dishes from Trypcase Soy agar, Sabouraud Dextrose agar and Mac Conkey agar and 100 mL Trypcase Soy broth and 100 mL Mac Conkey broth of the liquid me-dia were used for manipulation.The test microorganisms that were part of this val-idation were the standard microorganisms recommend-ed by the current European Pharmacopeia for the meth-od suitability test. Those are: Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 (Ph.Eur., 2013).Method For determination of the antimicrobial activity and validation of the test method challenge test with the above mentioned microorganisms were used and the microbio-logical method of choice was the surface-spread method and direct inoculation in the liquid media for the test of ab-sence of Escherichia coli. The number of all microorgan-isms applied in the challenge tests was less than 100 cfu/mL. Each application was made in duplicate and the tem-S2 OP 60138Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 137 - 138 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationsperature and the time of incubation depended of the type of the medium. Trypcase Soy agar was incubated for five days at temperature from 30-35 @C, Sabouraud Dextrose agar was incubated for seven days at temperature from 20-25 @C, Trypcase Soy broth was incubated for 24h at tem-perature from 30-35 @C, Mac Conkey broth was incubat-ed for 24h at temperature from 42-44 @C and Mac Conkey agar was incubated for 24h at temperature from 30-35 @C.After the incubation time the relation between the number of the each microorganism dissolved in buffered sodium chloride pepton water pH 7 and the number of the of the same microorganism in the presence of the product was calculated. When verifying the suitability of the plate-count method, a mean of any of the test organisms not dif-fering by a factor greater than 2 must be obtained (Clontz, 2009; Ph.Eur., 2013; USP, 2014).Results and discussionThe results from the determination of the antimicrobial activity of Gastoguard chewable tablets showed that it does not show antimicrobial effect against the used microorgan-isms. In addition to this the working dilution of the product would be 1:10 dilution. The individual challenge test revealed the following results:The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with P. aeruginosa was 93 cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 89 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.04.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with B. spizizenii was 52 cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 50 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.04.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with E. coli was 61cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the product was 50 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.22.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with S. aureus was 26 cfu/mL and the average num-ber of the microorganism in the presence of the product was 20 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.30.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with C. albicans was 31cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 37 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 0.84.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with A. brasiliensis was 22cfu/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 24 cfu/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 0.92. The acceptability factors for all the used microorgan-isms were in the compatibility framework and they never exceed the value 2.In the test for absence of E. coli, there was good visible growth in Trypcase Soy broth after 24h and in Mac Conkey broth the growth was followed by a change of color of the medium. There was also presence of red non-mucous colo-nies on Mac Conkey agar after 24h.The growth promotion test of the used media showed that they are adequate for routine microbiological analysis.Conclusion Gastoguard chewable tablets do not have antimicrobi-al activity against the used test microorganisms.The method suitability test of the product revealed that the routine microbiological analysis should be performed with surface-spread method from 1:10 dilution for TAMC and TYMC and the method of direct inoculation in the test for absence of E. coli. The acceptability factors were in the frame provided by the current European Pharmacopeia and never exceeded the value 2.ReferencesClontz, L., 2009. Microbial limit and bioburden tests.

It is considered to be one of the most commonly consumed drugs with more than 80 percent of the world's population consuming caffeine daily. The Europeans are found to be the world's largest consumers of caffeine in-take of approximately 4.6 kg/person/year (Norton et al., 2014). The presence of the pharmaceutical residues in the environment has become the subject of growing concern in the past decade. Due to the continuous input that leads to the long-term adverse effects on the aquatic and terres-trial organisms, the special attention is being paid to their concentration levels in the aquatic environment. Caffeine can be found in traces in surface water. The main paths for caffeine to enter wastewater stream are either in urine or when caffeine-containing products are discharged through household pipelines or sewers. Determination of caffeine in surface water is an important task for environmental re-searches and analysis because it is found to be a good in-dicator for human sewage because of its relatively high concentrations in surface water and its unambiguous an-thropogenic origin. Other important usage of caffeine is as an analgesic adjuvant in drug formulations for the treat-ment of headache and pain related to postpartum, postop-erative, and dental surgery and it is therapeutically applied for the treatment of migraine in combination with other drugs such as aspirin, paracetamol and tramadol. Caffeine is claimed to enhance the efficacy of these drugs (Madhu-sudhan, 2013). The goals of this study were to develop and validate high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for caffeine determination in food, beverages, sur-face water and drugs which is simple and easy to perform. This method could have a widespread application in food, environmental and pharmaceutical sciences.Materials and methodsSamples for caffeine determination in food and bever-ages were purchased at the Serbian market, samples of sur-face water were collected in amber bottles from seven rep-resentative locations of the Danube River on the territory of Novi Sad, Serbia, and tablets of analgoantipyretics con-taining caffeine were purchased from pharmacies in the vi-cinity of Novi Sad, Serbia. Caffeine from all samples was separated by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by HPLC. The chromatography was using two-solvent isocratic elu-tion. The HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) model Agi-lent HP 1100 system equipped with an autosampler (Wald-bronn, Germany) was used. The analytical column was the Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, i.d., 5 um particle size). Mobile phase was water-THF (0.1% THF in water adjusted to pH 8 with 0.1 M NaOH) - acetonitrile (90:10) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The HPLC mobile phase was prepared fresh daily and filtered through a 0.45 um nylon filter. Run time was 10 min, column temperature 25 degC and analytes were detected at 273 nm.Results and discussionThe linearity between caffeine concentrations and the response was tested for concentration levels ranging from (0.010-100) mg/L. High value of coefficient of correlation r=1 showed an excellent correlation between concentra-tions and peak areas. Calculated limit of detection (LOD-3.3*s/S) and quantification (LOQ-10*s/S) were 0.007 mg/L and 0.012 mg/L, respectively. According to the re-S2 OP 61140Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 139 - 140 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationscovery values of (98.33-100.22)% the method showed ac-ceptable accuracy. Repeatability of the method was test-ed by analyzing three different concentrations of caffeine standards in six repetitions. The relative standard devia-tions (RSD) ranged from 0.028% to 0.063% for retention time and from 0.015% to 0.65% for peak area showing ex-cellent repeatability."
