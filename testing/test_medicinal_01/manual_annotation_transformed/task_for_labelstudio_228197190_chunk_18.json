      "text": "Over a third of participants (37%, n=36) said they did not know of any interactions between HMs and CWM; while, the majority of participants (63%, n=62) said they were aware of interactions. Those participants who said they knew of interactions between HMs and CWM, 56% (n=55) named at least one interaction (Table 3-6). The most common herbal product known to interact, described by 37% (n=33) of participants, was St Johns Wort (SJW). SJW is one of the most well-known herbal remedies which has been used to treat mild depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, seasonal affective disorder, toothache, pain, gastritis, stomach ulcers, and aid local wound healing (Chevallier, 2007). Due to the numerous interactions with CWM it has been extensively researched. There are several active constituents in SJW responsible for its diverse medical uses including flavonoids, hypericin, and hyperforin (Williamson et al., 2013). SJW is known to affect a number of the cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes which accounts for the range of interactions associated with it. It has an enzyme inducing effect on the CYP 3A4, CYP 219 and CYP 2E1 isoenzymes. The role of these isoenzymes on drug distribution and metabolism is speeded up rendering other drugs less or ineffective; this causes SJW to interact with drugs such as anti-epileptics (carbamazepine and phenytoin), contraceptive pills, ciclosporin, theophylline, antidepressants - monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and warfarin (Henderson et al., 2002; Williamson et al., 2013). SJW can also affect the transporter protein P-glycoprotein, which has an essential role in drug absorption from the intestine, and distribution, acting as a drug efflux pump (Gurley et al., 2008). One of the main drugs affected by this mechanism is digoxin, a drug which has a narrow therapeutic index; therefore, small variations in blood concentrations can lead to toxicity or a sub therapeutic dose (Currie et al., 2011). There are several studies which demonstrate that the induction of the P-glycoprotein in the intestine by SJW leads to reduced absorption of digoxin (Hennessy et al., 2002); hence reducing the concentration of digoxin in the blood rendering the drug ineffective. Other drugs affected by this include ciclosporin and fexofenadine (Gurley et al., 2008). Participants also mentioned the interactions between warfarin and several herbal remedies such as ginseng, gingko, garlic, and cranberry juice. It has been reported that these substances can impair platelet aggregation, therefore effect blood coagulation. The International Normalised Ratio (INR) is a measure of the blood coagulation, which should be between 2-3 depending on the condition for which warfarin is initiated (BNF, 2015). A high INR means the blood is thinner so takes longer to clot, increasing the risk of bleeding; while a low INR means the blood clots too quickly. As these HMs reduce platelet aggregation, if 120 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra taken with warfarin they can also increase the risk of bleeding. One study claimed that ginseng reduced the effectiveness of warfarin; however, the pharmacological mechanism remains unclear (Yuan et al., 2004). Reports that cranberry juice inhibited the metabolism of warfarin therefore reducing its clearance from the body and increasing its effects were documented by the Committee of Safety of Medicines /MHRA when several incidents of increased INR and bleeding were reported (CSM/MHRA 2003). A study in the UK which looked at the pharmaceutical care plans of 631 patients in an outpatient anticoagulant clinic found that 170 patients were using some form of HM at the same time as taking warfarin; of these patients 58% were taking something which could potentially interact with warfarin. The authors concluded that by taking a full drug history from patients, potential interactions between HMs and warfarin could be avoided (Ramsay et al., 2005). Fugh-Berman and Ernst (2001) say those taking anticoagulants especially coumarins should generally be advised to avoid taking any HMs. As the practice of polypharmacy, whereby multiple drugs are consumed concurrently is becoming more common (Edwards et al., 2012), the risk of interactions between HMs and CWM needs to be considered. Furthermore, HCPs need to be more aware about potential interactions which could affect their patients' health. Although there are some valuable texts which summarise herb-drug interactions published (e.g. Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions - Williamson et al., 2013), such books are not readily available to HCPs. As identified by participants 20, 59, and 67 there are a variety of sources available to determine herb-drug interactions; however due to the lack of research on many HMs there may be limited evidence available to inform and guide HCPs. 121 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 3-6 Interactions between Herbal and Conventional Western Medicines Identified by Healthcare Professionals Participant Number: Interactions between Traditional Herbal Medicines and Conventional Western Medicines: 2 St John's wort with contraceptives and anti-depressants (SSRI's and MAOI's). Dan shen with anticoagulants. 10 St John's wort interacts with many drugs as it is a cytochrome P450 3AE inducer; for example, oral contraceptives, warfarin, and simvastatin. 12 I'm aware of a lot of interactions between herbal medicines and P-glycoprotein and cytochrome enzymes, which can in turn affect drugs that are dependent on them. St John's wort is an example of a herbal medicine that can produce such interactions. 15 Too many to list- St. John's wort & SSRIs can cause serotonin syndrome. Garlic, ginkgo & ginseng in combination with fish oil can cause impaired coagulation /blood pressure. 16 St. John's wort and warfarin. 17 While working as a medicines information pharmacist in secondary care, I formulated a table of interactions between warfarin and a large variety of herbal/traditional compounds. 18 St. John's Wort and various other medications, including some anti-retrovirals. 20 I refer to Stockley-particularly for St. John's wort. 22 INR changes Enzyme induction Additive side effects. 24 St. John's wort. 25 St John's wort interacts with CYP450 liver metabolised drugs. 26 St. John's wort and warfarin. 30 Ginseng known to interact as well as St. John's wort with antiretrovirals for HIV.

Table 3-6 Interactions between Herbal and Conventional Western Medicines Identified by Healthcare Professionals Continued... 123 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.6.4 Professional Opinions of Herbal Medicines The final part of the questionnaire aimed to investigate HCPs professional opinions on the safety and efficacy of HMs. The literature search around this topic revealed that there was limited information available about how much information is passed on to undergraduate HCPs during their courses (Smith, 2011); for this reason participants were asked whether or not they received sufficient education on HMs during their training. This section was completed by 96 participants. Question 10: Do you think the use of plants, herbs and spices is effective to prevent or treat various health conditions? Two thirds of the participants (66%, n=63) said they thought HMs were effective. Participants commented on how the long standing use of HMs throughout history was an important factor in determining the efficacy of HMs; as demonstrated by participant 42 (a pharmacist) who stated, \"Pharmacy is generally sceptical about the use of traditional herbal medicines because of lack of scientific studies but, in my opinion, traditional herbal medicines can be very effective in non-Western countries where there is a tradition for this. If something has been used for centuries and works then it works.\" In addition, participant 36 (a consultant physician) claimed, \"I am sure that there is some evidence of benefit (even if placebo effect) for some herbal medicines - but I do not see them as a replacement for conventional medicine.\" Despite the limited evidence to support the health claims associated with HMs the transmission of this knowledge throughout time has been used an indicator for the efficacy of HMs. The remaining third of participants (34%, n=33) who did not think HMs were effective or any better than a placebo, made comments regarding the lack of evidence to prove the efficacy of HMs. The emphasis on the lack of reliable scientific evidence to support the use of HMs, was illustrated by participant 62 who said, \"If you look at NCCAM's herbs at a glance (http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm) you will see that there is not a single herbal preparation for which there is good evidence for efficacy, even according to this pro- CAM organisation. They originated in a time when anecdote rather than proper testing sufficed; there is no excuse for pharmacies selling things that are either unproven or disproved.\" Although there were mixed reviews about the effectiveness of HMs, some participants suggested that HMs were used to supplement CWM, especially in patients with cancer and HIV. Participant 63 (a GP) said, \"Western medicine alone is not enough to treat someone 124 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra holistically. Additional approaches are required, including herbal medicines and complementary therapies e.g. art therapy, hypnotherapy. Many issues are stress related or exacerbated by stress and these unfortunately are not dealt with adequately.\" This is supported by findings from Awodele et al. (2012) who uncovered that 41% (n=123) of participants in their survey of Nigerian HCPs thought that HMs were effective for chronic conditions; although none thought that HMs alone could be used to treat a patient. Subscribers to the DTB were asked to complete a survey about HMs, of the 164 respondents who were asked if they thought HMs were helpful: 22.2% (n=36) said 'rarely or never' while 75.3% (n=122) said HMs were helpful 'in some circumstances' (DTB, 2010). It is well known that many of the HMs used are based on their traditional reputation rather than clinical evidence (Newall et al., 1996). In addition, many HMs may be used in their crude form, rather than in pharmaceutical formulations making it difficult to determine the safety and efficacy of HMs due to the vast range of formulations and irregular doses. The emphasis on evidence based medicines requires validated scientific evidence including randomised controlled trials which prove the efficacy of drugs; however, this information is not available for most HMs (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). More research on HMs is now being conducted to validate the efficacy of HMs. For example, the wealth of literature available on SJW which has provided useful evidence to support the traditional health claims associated with its use. The vast amount of information available on SJW has even led some people to question whether it is still considered a HM or a CWM as stated by participant 82, \"depends if St John's wort is classed as traditional or not!\" The results for question 10 demonstrate the different views HCPs had regarding the efficacy of HMs. A larger number of participants agreed that HMs were effective for some health conditions; however, there were still some reservations regarding the perceived efficacy of HMs due to the lack of clinical data to support their use. Question 11: Do you think the use of plants, herbs and spices is safe? One of the reasons for the popularity of HMs is the belief that they are natural and therefore safe (Shaw et al., 2012); similar views were shared by 58% (n=56) of participants in this survey who thought HMs were safe. Participant 42 (a pharmacist) who agreed HMs were safe stated, \"conventional Western medicines are just as harmful as traditional herbal medicines if used improperly and in excess.\" On the other hand, 42% (n=40) of HCPs did not agree that HMs were safe. Some participants stated that HMs may be more dangerous than CWM due to the lack of evidence to support their use. Various reasons participants felt 125 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra HMs were not safe included the lack of clinical evidence to support their use, the lack of regulation of HMs, and problems of quality and contamination. Several participants commented on the need for proper regulation to be able to determine the safety of HMs. Participant 36 (a consultant physician) said, \"Whilst only a small amount of harms are caused - I cannot call them safe because in some instances they are not. I think that all in all more regulation is needed and then I would consider the patient's views in taking a cautious approach to use of herbal remedies in some conditions,\" and participant 44 (a pharmacist) who noted, \"Traditional herbal medicines need to be regulated better, I have seen recent reports of hazardous contaminants.\" An interesting statement was made by participant 15 (an anaesthesia registrar) who claimed, \"It's more complex than whether they're safe or not - it depends on the dose, what other medication the patient is on & the interaction between them (if any). Often, herbal products have inconsistent concentrations between batches & therefore the true dose is never known. There have been instances of additives not listed on packaging also being included in the product - I feel generally these products are an unknown quantity because the contents, concentration & production methods are subject to much lower standards of scrutiny than tablets. They are drugs just as much as tablets are, the 'herbal' label lulls people into thinking there are no possible side effects - this is not true, nor is it safe.\" This reiterates that there are numerous factors which can affect the safety of HMs including: the dose (high doses may cause toxicity), co-morbidities (taking HMs while taking CWM increases the risk of interactions), time of use (before surgery could impair blood coagulation or cause complications, during pregnancy or lactation could affect the baby), adulteration (the wrong species selected), or contamination (heavy metals or other active constituents) (Upton and Romm, 2012). Furthermore, participant 59 stated, \"For most conditions, herbal medicine is unnecessary, ineffective and the risk of interactions with pharmaceutical drugs too high to recommend using them for any condition. Contamination (accidental, natural and deliberate) means their safety will always be in question.\""
