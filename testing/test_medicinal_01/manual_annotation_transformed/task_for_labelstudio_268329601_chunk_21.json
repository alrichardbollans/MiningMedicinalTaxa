Bread madeof it without separating the bran dries and passes,when cleaned from the bran it nourishes more, but isless laxative.\" (Hippocrates, ca. 400 BCE)' ' ' ' 'HISTORY. As Hindu scripture suggests, bread isclearly one of our most important foods. Threecommon English words also speak to its significance.A \"lord\" is the keeper of the loaf; a \"lady\" is thekneader of the loaf; a \"companion\" is a person withwhom we eat bread.To most of us, bread is a dough made from wheatflour and water that is baked in an oven. A broaderdefinition recognizes that bread may be made fromcarbohydrate sources other than wheat and that itmay be deep-fried, cooked on a griddle, or poachedand then baked, in the case of the bagel. Bread is anancient foodstuff, older than our recorded history. Inits earliest form, bread was probably a gooey doughof wild cereal grains mixed with water. It evolved outof more watery gruels, grouts, or porridges. Thegrains had been beaten between two rocks to crackthem. The mass was parched and then formed intoflat cakes that could be cooked on hot stones.Crushing and parching also separated the grain itselffrom hulls that adhered to it. The domestication ofwheat brought about a critical improvement --varieties that could be easily husked.About 6000 years ago, the Egyptians discovered thatuncooked dough would begin to bubble and to give offa characteristic sour smell if left alone for a few hours.When cooked, this version of dough made a lighter,more palatable leavened bread. They quickly foundthat a small piece of the soured dough would producethis same effect in freshly made dough. So didsoaking crushed wheat grains in white wine for aboutthree days. The relationship between brewing andbread making has always been an intimate one. TheEgyptians became master bread makers, addinghoney, eggs, and various aromatic substances to theircreations. They formed the dough into a loaves ofvarious shapes and baked them in a ovens of theirown design. They were a two-chambered oven,shaped like a bee hive. The fire was maintained in thelower compartment and the baking occurred in theupper section.The Greeks and Romans were also skilled bakers.Because they drank wine, fermented grape juice wastheir source of yeast. Pliny noted, however, that thebarbarians in Spain and France who were beerdrinkers managed to make a lighter loaf of bread byusing scrapings from the beer vats. The Romansdeveloped the first rotary mill powered by animals, byslaves, or by running water. A thousand years later,Europeans would adopt an Arab invention, thewindmill. Cereal grains were crushed between astationary lower mill stone and an upper one thatrotated. Milling does two things. It separates theendosperm from the bran (the outer layers of thegrain) and from the germ (the oily embryo). It alsoreduces the starchy endosperm to a fine powder, theflour. Flour comes from the same root word as\"flower,\" meaning that it is the best part of the grain.The Romans were probably the first to establishcommercial bakeries. Large stone bowls with woodenpaddles to mix and knead dough allowed largequantities of dough to be processed. Knowledge ofthese techniques spread with the Roman army. By theway, since the days of the ancient Greeks and Romanswhite bread made from refined flour has beenconsidered far superior to the coarser, darker breads.The upper class has eaten white bread; the poorer folkand those in prison ate unleavened bread made frombarley, oats, or rye.The invention of the steam engine by James Watt in1769 allowed for significant technologicaladvancements. In 1834, Jacob Sulzburger developedthe steam-powered milling machine that used steelrollers. In 1870, Edmund La Croix invented a way ofseparating the middlings (bran, germ, and othercoarse materials) from the starchy endosperm. Rollerscracked the cereal grain, rather than crushing it. Thegrains were then passed through a series of screens ofincreasingly finer mesh. Air currents blew awayimpurities; the bran and germ were also sifted off.BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY. When the ancientEgyptians noticed that soured dough gave off bubblesand a particular smell, they were observing theactivity of air-borne, wild yeasts that had gotten intothe dough and were now carrying out their lifeprocesses. Yeasts are microscopic, one-celled fungi.The particular species that is important in breadmaking is the same one used in brewing,Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The name translatesroughly as \"brewer's sugar fungus.\" The yeast cellsconvert the starchy endosperm in the dough to carbondioxide and alcohol. The chemical process is starch --> glucose --> 2 pyruvic acid --> 2 CO2 + 2 ethylalcohol. The carbon dioxide is trapped in the doughand forms gas pockets. Baking the dough increasedthe generation of carbon dioxide. The alcohol (ethanolor ethyl alcohol) escapes from the baking bread andexplains, at least partially, the characteristic aromathat we find so pleasing. Of course, at a certain stageduring baking, the temperature rises to a point atwhich the yeasts are killed. One pound of doughcontains about three billion yeast cells. Did theysuffer?All carbohydrate sources will be worked on by theyeast cells in the same fashion. One cereal grain,wheat, is especially well suited to bread makingbecause it contains two proteins, glutenin andgliadin, that combine when moistened to form anelastic substance called gluten. When wheat dough iskneaded, gluten will absorb up to twice its weight inwater and it will form a three dimensional mesh ormatrix that traps carbon dioxide and stabilizes it.Otherwise, the raised dough would collapse at somepoint during the baking process. Kneading strengthensthe gluten structure, increasing its ability to stretch.When you purchase lighter, fluffier breads made fromrye or some other grain, these have wheat flour inthem to impart this feature. This special feature ofwheat helps to explain why breadmaking was not animportant aspect of life in regions where ricepredominates or starchy root crops are the primarycarbohydrate source.The production of carbon dioxide by yeast cells is notthe only mechanism for making raised or leavenedbreads. Much later, we discovered that ash made froma hardwood, when soaked in water, would yieldcarbon dioxide when heated. This hardwood ash is, forall practical purposes, lye. In the last century, bakingsoda was developed. It is sodium bicarbonate(NaHCO3), an alkaline substance that imparts anunpleasant taste to the bread unless it was neutralizedby an acid of some sort. Buttermilk and fruit juiceshave been traditional sources. French bread is madefrom milk, butter, and beer leavening. Baking powder,sodium bicarbonate combined with cream of tartar to-71-supply the acidic neutralizer, was developed in the1840's. The chemical process is sodium bicarbonate +tartaric acid --> sodium tartrate + water + carbondioxide. In 1855, packaged baking soda, cream oftartar, and cornstarch to absorb excess moisture wasdeveloped. In 1867, Charles and MaximillianFleischmann, two Austrian bakers, started the yeast-making industry in the United States. Yeast cells weregrown in a sugar solution. Then excess water wasremoved and the yeast was mixed with starch,compressed into cakes, and packed in balsa woodboxes. Dry yeast cakes, developed during World WarII, became available for widespread use after 1945.European scientists had also developed the techniquesneeded to grow particular strains of yeasts for avariety of special purposes, including those of thebaker.The flour that we use today is typically bleached andaged. Bleaching yields the uniform white color thatmany of us find aesthetically appealing. Chlorinedioxide is often the bleaching agent. If you allow flourto sit around, the oxygen in the atmosphere willaccomplish the same result. Unbleached flour has ayellow cast to it, the result of pigments calledxanthophylls. Various products made from semolinawheat, such as pastas, use unbleached flour. Thebleaching process also destroys small amounts ofVitamin E. \"Aged\" or \"improved\" flour has betterbaking qualities. Aging allows important changes ingluten to occur.You might think that bread making is a dull,noncontroversial subject. You would be wrong! In1861, Eben Horsford, a Harvard professor (there-fore,immediately suspect) warned that yeast cells werepoisonous molds and should not be used. After all,they were microbes -- germs. Instead, he suggesteda baking powder made from lime and sodiumphosphate, both of which are found in the humanbody. At about the same time, a pamphlet wasdistributed that argued that the bread of the day was\"... rotted by fermentation or poisoned with acids andalkalis, [so that] the staff of life has well become thestaff of death.\" The so-called Boston Water Cure urgeduse of an oven that was so hot that dough would bepuffed up by the sudden expansion of air andvaporized water. The result was a loaf of bread thatwas amazingly dense and unpopular. In the 19thcentury, there was also concern abut the adulterationof bakers' bread with alum, chalk, and ground uphuman bones!WHITE OR BROWN BREAD? A rephrasing of thequote from Hippocrates cited above suggests thatbrown bread has a laxative effect on us and that whitebread is more nutritious. This is consistent with a viewespoused by the ancient Greeks and Romans -- whitebread is better than brown bread made from wholewheat grains or from grains other than wheat. Thisopinion persisted, more or less unchallenged, until the19th century. The Reverend Sylvester Graham and Dr.John Harvey Kellogg, inventor of the Graham Crackerand one of the brothers who founded Kellogg Cereals,were vocal advocates of the superiority of whole graincereals. Graham wrote that separating the endospermfrom the bran was akin to \"... put[ting] asunder whatGod has joined together....\" Kellogg focused hisattention on the laxative effects of the brancomponent. He believed that we ought to have threeor more bowel movements each day to prevent thebuild up of intestinal poisons.The views of Graham and Kellogg gained credibilitywith the appearance of studies in the 1970's ondietary fiber. These suggested that the higher theintake of these indigestible cell wall components, thelower the risk of intestinal disorders, hemorrhoids, andcancer of the colon and rectum. Brown bread hasmore nutrients in it than white bread and it clearly hasa higher fiber content. The irony is that, \"... becausethe cellulosic material of the bran cannot be digestedand tends to speed the passage of food through thehuman digestive tract, the total nutritive contributionof whole wheat flour is less than that found inenriched white flour products.\" (Pomeranz, 1973)RICE\"Grain upon grain, fresh and delightful as frosta dazzling jewelto what can I compare this treasure?\" (Yang Ji, Ming Dynasty poet)There are 20-25 species in the genus Oryza, but onlytwo are of economic significance. Asian rice, Oryzasativa, is the principal food for about 60% of theworld's population. There is some question as to itsnativity. Some experts say it is native to India; othersto southwest China or southeast Asia. It has beencultivated in southeast Asia for at least 7000 years.Sealed pots of rice 8000 years old have been found inChina. Literally thousands of cultivars have beendeveloped, 8000 of them in India alone. Asian ricewas introduced into America in 1647. Oryzaglaberrima, red rice or African rice, is native to Africaand has been used locally there for about 3500 years.Unlike wheat, most kinds of rice are diploid (2n = 2x= 24). It is usually grown in a swampy field known asa paddy. This helps to explain why so much rice israised in the monsoon belt where heavy seasonalrainfall is used. In most instances, rice seeds are notplanted directly in the paddies. Instead there arenurseries where seedlings are started and thentransferred. The seedlings are planted in smallbunches, each clump about 4-16\" from the next one.Most cultivated strains require flooding, this beingaccomplished by taking advantage of the monsoonsand by the skillful manipulation of dikes in thepaddies. There are also cultivars called upland ricesthat can be grown in drier fields.At maturity, most rice plants are 4-6 ft. tall; somedeep water varieties reach 20 ft. Once the plants haveflowered, the water level is reduced and finally thesupply is shut off entirely and the fields allowed todry. When the plants begin to wither, it is time toharvest the crop. In the Old World, the harvesting andthreshing processes are done by hand. In the U.S. andother technologically advanced countries, much of thisis done by machine. In this country, Arkansas,Louisiana, Mississippi, and California are the main ricegrowing states.KINDS OF RICE. We commonly recognize three typesof rice based upon the length of the grain: long:tropical rices; not too soft nor starchy; grains 7-8 mmlong, the length prized by the connoisseur; medium:commonly grown in the U. S.; somewhat softer;grains averaging about 6.6 mm long; short: grown inthe more northern climates, often planted in Japan;even more starchy; grains averaging about 5.5 mmlong.Rice cultivars vary in the \"stickiness\" of their grains.This is a function of the proportion of amylose andamylopectin, two types of starch. The higher theamylopectin, the stickier the rice. The range is about70% in the least sticky to about 83% in the stickiest.-72-Brown rice has not had its nutrient-rich outer layersremoved during processing. In other words, it has notbeen pearled or polished. Given its nutritionalsuperiority, why do we eat white rice? Because brownrice is harder to cook, tougher, not as sticky, goesrancid more rapidly, is more susceptible to insects,and has been considered aesthetically inferior to whiterice since ancient times.Converted rice has been steeped, steamed, anddried before it is milled. The technique was developedabout 2000 years ago in India and Pakistan. Severalchanges occur, including diffusion of Vit. B from thebran and germ into the endosperm.In the 1904 World's Fair, Quaker oats introducedpuffed rice, the \"cereal that was shot from guns. \"They used a canon from the Spanish-American War!Today's puffed rice is prepared in pressure cookers,with the pressure released at the last minute to puffthe rice.Basmati rice was originally grown in the foothills ofthe Himalayas, where it has been used for thousandsof years. It is a long-grained rice that is aged toreduce moisture content. Basmati rice is particularlypopular in Middle Eastern and Indian markets. Thegrains are yellow and have a characteristic sweet,nutty aroma and flavor.NUTRITIVE VALUE. The intact grain is a good sourceof iron, calcium, magnesium, selenium, vitamin E, theB vitamins, and an essential fatty acid, alpha linoleicacid. However, people who subsist on polished rice aremore likely to suffer from beriberi, brought on by adeficiency in vitamin B1 (thiamine). Sensory nervesare affected, starting with the feet and workingupward in the body. In one form of the disease,congestive heart failure occurs.MAIZE OR CORN\"... a sort of grain they called maiz which was welltasted, bak'd, dry'd and made into flour. \"(Christopher Columbus, 5 November 1492)\"This Corne is a marveilous strange plante, nothingresembling any other kinde of grayne.\" (H. Lyte, 1578)' ' ' ' 'First, a word about the common name of Zea mays. Inthis country, we usually call this plant corn or Indiancorn. Maize is a better common name (and a perfectlylegitimate one) because corn is used by other English-speaking peoples around the world for what we wouldcall wheat, oats, or as a generic term for cerealgrains. This explains the use of the word \"corn\" in theHebrew Bible and other ancient texts, since what wecall corn would have been unknown to them.There are three features of maize that make itdifferent from wheat, rice, or any other cereal. It isthe only important cereal that is native to the NewWorld. Second, maize as we known it today isconsiderably different in appearance from its wildancestors."
