      "text": "Consequently, proper development of legislation and regulation of herbal medicines has been impaired at the public expense.Generally, data are currently lacking on:* The active constituents and/or metabolites* Pharmacology* Pharmacokinetics* Toxicology* Possibilities of drug-herb interactions, as well as interactions with food and alcohol* Frequency of possible adverse effects, and effects of long term use* Possible effects in specific patient groups e.g. children, the elderly* Possible effects for use during pregnancy and lactationCopy 1 17Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Insufficient data on the factors stated above also makes it hard to compare and contrast the risk-benefit profile of several phytomedicines with that of conventional drugs, where effectiveness has been reported.Toxicity related to the use of phytomedicines may have multiple causes but generally can be divided into two distinguishable categories as highlighted in Tables 1.5 and 1.6 respectively. The first category can be designated as extrinsic or non-plant associated, where toxic effects or adverse reactions occurred due to accidental or deliberate substitution or contamination of the plant material described on the label. On the other hand, the second category is more intrinsic or plant-associated in nature. In this category, the plant material itself or the phytochemicals present, thus an active agent in the herbal medicinal products, which causes the health risks.Table 1.5. Extrinsic or non-plant-associated causative factors involved in adverse drug reactions.Adulteration* Accidental or deliberate substitution of the original plant material by other plant speciesContamination* Micro-organisms (bacteria including Salmonella, E.coli, yeasts, moulds)* Microbial toxins (aflatoxins, lipopolysaccharides)* Heavy metals (mercury, lead, etc. )* Pesticides and/or herbicides* Fumigants* Radioactive particlesSubstitution* Synthetic drugs (anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids etc. )* Animal substances (enzymes, hormones etc. )Copy 1 18Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Table 1.6. Intrinsic or plant-associated causative factors; health risks related to the medicinal herb itself as active ingredient in the phytomedicine. * Use of plants containing constituents that are known to affect bioavailability and/or pharmacokinetics of other compounds or drugs* Ignored toxicity of plant constituent(s) present in the product* Use of plants, either as raw material or in processed form, of which at present no or insufficient data regarding safety are available* Use of highly concentrated or specifically processed extractsAlthough the number of side effects attributed to the use of phytomedicines represents only a small proportion of the total amount of adverse drug reactions in the WHO database (Barnes, 1998), reports on toxic effects of or adverse reactions to herbal preparations have regularly been published over the past years (Barnes, 1998). Proponents of phytotherapy usually present long-standing experience in traditional medicine as evidence of their safety, unfortunately this type of evidence has considerable deficiencies. Determining botanicals that contain phytochemicals, which manifest their toxicities and acute adverse effects in a large fraction of users is relatively easy. A 5-year toxicological study by the UK National Poisons Unit from 1991 to 1995 on potentially serious adverse reactions attributed to exposure to herbal remedies, showed there were 785 cases of possible or definitive positive poisoning out of 1297 inquiries (Shaw et al., 1997). Although the study concluded that the overall risk to public health was low, there were clusters of cases that deserve serious attention where there were 21 incidents of hepatotoxicity including two deaths due to the use of traditional medicines although no causative agent was identified.The harder task is recognising subtle adverse effects that develop over time and occur infrequently, for example hypokalemia from the use of anthranoid laxatives (Blumenthal, 1998), or that are readily ascribed to an underlying disease such as hepatitis from celandine, a bile duct remedy derived from Chelidonium majus (Benninger et al., 1999). Hypothetically, for a herb that caused an adverse reaction in 1 for every 1000 users, a traditional practitioner would have to prescribed the herb to 4800 patients, that is 1 new user per day for more than 18 years, in order to obtain a 95% probability of observing such reaction in more than 1 user (De Smet, 1995).Copy 1 19Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Thus, the more chronic but subtle form of toxicity such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity effects of phytochemicals will remain unrecognised if their applications in traditional settings were left unexamined, as these may have been undetermined by previous generations. For example, although Aristolochia fangchi have been used for centuries in Chinese traditional medicine, its nephrotoxicity and potential to induce urothelial carcinoma by DNA-adduct formation has only recently been elucidated (Nortier|| et al., 2000; Lord et al., 2001) and it was the same case with the hepatotoxicity potential of| Piper methysticum (Escher et al., 2001). !IfFurthermore, there is always a belief among the general public that herbal medicines orj supplements are safe primarily because they are derived from nature, compared to syntheticj| compounds. Therefore, it was often considered harmless by the public that the consumption of these herbal products would not cause profound injury directly or vice-versa. Herb-drugs interactions for example, can occur at the pharmaceutical, pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic levels (Beijnen & Schellens, 2004). The application of herbal medicines in combination with conventional therapeutics may increase the risk for undesired interactions primarily due to the narrow therapeutic window of many oncolytic drugs.| Alarmingly, more than 72% of cancer patients in the US for example, failed to inform theirij doctors about herbal products consumption when undergoing conventional therapy at the| same time (Sparreboom et al., 2004). One of the well-known examples of a clinicallysignificant effect displayed by herbs on the pharmacokinetic of chemotherapeutic drugs is Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort), which is popular among cancer patients due to its suggested activity on mild to moderate levels of depression (Mathijssen et al., 2002). The plasma levels of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan was 42% lower in cancer patients who took Hypericum at the same time. Co-administration of cyclosporin with Hypericum leads to decrease cyclosporin plasma concentration (Barone et al., 2000) and disrupts hormonal contraception with irregular bleeding when taken together with ethynylestradiol (Schwarz et al., 2003). Even the innocently looking grapefruit (iCitrus paradisi) juice, has been shown to caused 26.2% reduction in etoposide bioavailability (Reif et al., 2002) and the culprit is bergamottin, a major furanocoumarin that reversibly inhibited the activities of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 in human liver microsomes (He et al., 1998), which may last up to 24 hours. It also alters the concentration of many drug substrates for CYP3A4 when taken simultaneously (Quo et al.,2000). These examples highlight the need for more research not only into direct detrimentalCopy 1 20Y. Sharifuddinj Chapter 1effects pose by phytochemicals but also indirect effects or impacts that are not clearly manifested including mutations and metabolic enzymes manipulation. The public may not | be aware of these hidden risks due to the 'naturally safe' paradigm long held about herbaliproducts.Although phytomedicines are not devoid of risk, they could still be safer than synthetic drugs. Currently, the relative safety of phytomedicines is undefinable, many existing data indicate that adverse reactions, especially serious ones, occur less frequently than with prescribed synthetic drugs. Kava {Piper methysticum), an herbal anxiolytic (Pittler & Ernst,2003) that raised serious concern due to its hepatotoxicity effect, could be safer than benzodiazepines, according to preliminary data (Schulze et al., 2003) and herbal I antidepressant St. John's wort {Hypericum perforatum), has only about half the rate ofI possible adverse reactions compared to conventional antidepressants (Linde et al, 1996;Stevinson & Ernst, 1999). However, its use is only recommended for weak and mild | depression and was found not to be effective for major depression cases compared to| placebo (Linde et al., 1996; Shelton et al., 2001; Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group,i1 2002) The World Health Organization's monitoring centre collected 8985 reports ofj adverse reaction events associated with phytomedicines from 55 countries between 1968! and 1997 (Farah & Edwards, 2000). Even though this figure may seem impressively high,jit amounts to only a small fraction of adverse events associated with synthetic drugs held in I the same database (Farah & Edwards, 2000). However, one must recognise the fact thatrelative paucity could also be due to a relatively higher level of underreporting due to the perceived safety of natural herbs among the general population and more conclusive evidence on the relative safety risks of phytomedicines against conventional drugs is scarce.Copy I 21Y. SharifuddinChapter 11.7 Plants and Secondary MetabolitesAs briefly stated before, plants have evolved various defence mechanisms including chemical, mechanical or even mimicry to improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivory and infection. Over billions of years of evolution, plants continually produce the necessary metabolites to out-manoeuvre pathogens in their local environment or to repel herbivores. If the metabolites were useful to the plant, the biosynthetic genes were retained, with subsequent genetic modifications and improving the I process yielding exotic structures rich in functional groups and stereochemistry. Chemicalidefence involved the production of organic compounds that are not essential to metabolic, photosynthetic or other physiologically crucial activities and are known as secondary metabolites. They are usually synthesised as by-products during the production of primary metabolic process and play a major role in deterring herbivores.Plants have developed various secondary metabolites and can generally be classified into three sub-groups namely nitrogen compounds (including alkaloids and glucosinolates), terpenes and phenolics.1.8 Brief Introduction to Andrographis paniculateAndrographis paniculata is a shrub that is found throughout tropical and sub-tropical Asia | and is locally known in Malaysia as 'Hempedu bumi' and 'Akar cerita bidara'. This herbaceous, annual herb is from the family Acanthaceae with a slightly, characteristic odour and an intensely bitter taste, hence commonly known as 'king of bitter'. Pictures of various parts of the plant is shown in Figure 1.7 and Table 1.7 shows the systematic position of Andrographis paniculata.Copy 1 22Y. SharifuddinChapter IFig. 1.7. Pictures o f various parts o f Andrographis paniculata. (a) The whole plant can grow up to 1 m in height. (b) The flowering part o f the plant, (c) Seeds.Table 1.7. Systematic position of A. paniculataAngiospermsDicotyledonaeGamopetalaeBicarpellataePersonalesJusticieaeAcanthaceaeAndrographispaniculataCopy I2 3Y. SharifuddinChapter IThe aerial part of the herb contains several diterpenoids and diterpene glycosides especially andrographolide, a major constituent which is not less than 6% of the total diterpene lactones present and is mainly responsible for its bitter taste. Other diterpene lactones present free and in glycosidic forms include 14-deoxyandrographolide, 14-deoxy-l 1,12- didehydroandrographolide, neoandrographolide, andrographiside, deoxyandrographiside and andropanoside (Kleipool, 1952). Table 1.8 listed the reported medical properties of andrographolide or extracts obtained from the herb.Table 1.8.

Rahman et al., 1999.Coon and Ernst (2004) conducted a systematic review on the safety and efficacy of Andrographis paniculata in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. It was found that the data collectively showed that A. paniculata is superior to placebo in alleviating the subjective symptoms of uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection. The authors also found a few spontaneous reports of adverse events and A. paniculata may be a safe and efficacious treatment for the relief of symptoms of uncomplicated upper tract infection but more research is warranted. However, there were several shortcomings of the review that need to be addressed (Coon & Ernst, 2004).Copy I2 4Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Fig. 1.8. The chemical structure of andrographolide with numbered carbon positions.1.9 The Compound of Interest: Andrographolide[ Andrographolide (CAS no: 5508-58-7) with IUPAC designation 3-{2-[decahydro-6-|I hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,8a-dimethyl-2-methylene-l-napthalenyl]-ethylidene}dihydro-4-hydroxy-2(3H)-furanone is the major bioactive constituent found in various parts of Andrographis paniculata particularly in the leaves. It is a labdane diterpene harbouring a y- lactone ring attached to a decahydronapthalene ring system via an unsaturated C-2 moiety. As shown above in Figure 1.8, it contains an a-alkylidene y-butyrolactone moiety as well as three hydroxyl groups located at C-3, C-14 and C-19 with these being secondary, allylic and primary respectively. These hydroxyls are responsible for the bioactivities of andrographolide (Nanduri et al., 2004). The stereochemistry of this phytochemical has been previously elucidated with the furan ring adopting an envelope conformation whereas the twoj bicyclic rings adopt a chair conformation (Smith et al., 1982; Fujita et al., 1984; Spek et al.,I 1987). Andrographolide was considered to be the most active constituent present in A.; paniculata extract (Kumar et al., 2004; Nanduri et al., 2004)Terpenes are ubiquitous in nature and occur in most species including humans and are sometimes referred to as isoprenes due to a common repetitive structural motif, the branched5-carbon (C5) unit or isopentane skeleton that is comparable to isoprene. They are a good example of a class of natural compound where many members are chiral, structurally diverse and have many functional group chemistry. Terpenes contribute to many of the aromas associated with plants and range in complexity from C5 units to polyisoprenes that includes leaf waxes, latex and rubber. This class of compounds are derived from a number of extensive reactions between two C5 units namely dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) whose chemical structures are depicted in Figure 1.9. Thus,Copy 1 25Y. Sharifuddinj Chapter 1the products of these reactions shall possess multiples of five carbons (C5). DMAPP and IPP1 are biosynthesised from two sources, either deoxyxylulose phosphate or mevalonic acid.I| (a) (b) (c); Fig. 1.9. Chemical structure of (a) isoprene, (b) dimethylalyll pyrophosphate and (c) isopentenyl pyrophosphate.The simplest of terpenes are hemiterpenes (C5) produced by modification reactions to either ; IPP or DMAPP and include simple acids such as angelic acid and tiglic acid, which are i structural isomers and form esters with many natural products. The complexity of structure | then progresses to monoterpenes with 10-carbon skeleton (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15),jj diterpenes (C20), triterpenes and steroids (C3o-derived) and tetraterpenes (C40, also known as 1 carotenoids).j| Diterpenes are widely distributed in plant resins and latex, some can be quite toxic. The|i presence of diterpenes in Rhododendron sp. leaves rendered them poisoinous. Diterpenes are|formed by the reaction of a 15-carbon chain, famesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) with IPP, which is the common basic unit of all terpenes with the first step of this reaction yields famesyl j allylic cation. This cation then reacts with IPP causing stereospecific loss of a proton forming I geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP)."
