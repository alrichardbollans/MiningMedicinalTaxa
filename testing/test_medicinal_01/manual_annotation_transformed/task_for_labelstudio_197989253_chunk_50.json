Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 2. In Europe it was reported to be cultivated in Spain, Belgium and the UK. In Europe, the plant was cultivated in greenhouse conditions, as it does not survive winter climate. Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 3.1490 Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 3.1491 Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 3.1492 Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 4.1493 Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 3.1494 Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 4.1495 Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 4.1496 Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 5.-274-The list of missing information includes issues that should not be relevant in novel food assessment. Microbiological issues are under general European food law, and hygiene rules apply similarly to non-novel and novel products. Novel food assessment is not about whether hygiene rules are obeyed. Similarly, it does not prevent a food from being authorised if it has allergenic potential. Many common foods have allergenic potential, and labelling allergens is another issue from novel food assessment.The conclusion of the Scientifi c Committee was that there was not enough information available to evaluate the safety of the plant. There was no data to support safe use of it as food ingredients or as sucrose substitute for diabetics and obese individuals.1497 On the same date (17 June 1999), the Committee also gave its negative opinion on the use of it as a food additive1498. The additive process is legally separate from the novel food process, but the decisions were intertwined. The outcome of the process is that Stevia plants and stevioside as a sweetener are banned in Europe. Nevertheless, they have appeared on the market1499.If we look at the opinion on stevioside as a food additive, we can better understand why the application on Stevia as novel food was rejected. There have been several studies on stevioside and its metabolite steviol. Particularly steviol seems to be problematic, as it has been shown to decrease fertility in male rats and to include developmental toxicity. It has been reported to cause cancer when fed at very high doses to rodents.1500Nangai nuts caseNangai nuts1501 (Canarium indicum Linne, kenari nuts1502, ngali nuts, galip nuts, java almonds) are the other example of a plant product that has been rejected as novel food in EU.The request to market nangai nuts was made on behalf of a Vanuatu company called Pacifi c Nuts Ltd. The request was submitted to the French authorities in December 1998. The initial assessment report by the French competent authorities concluded that the product is safe for human consumption and could therefore be authorised. The French decision was subject to certain recommendations regarding microbiological controls, regular monitoring of afl atoxin levels and labelling requirements similar to those for nuts in general because of potential allergenic risks.1503 This meant the French were willing to treat nangai nuts as quite harmless products, and considered normal precautions adequate.However, objections were raised by four other Member States. Therefore, the Scientifi c Committee for Food had to assess the product. They gave their opinion in March 2000, stating that data necessary for the assessment of the safety of the product is lacking. They said the product should not be authorised. 1504It was at this stage of the procedure when the applicant claimed that nangai nuts are in fact not a novel food at all. The applicant claimed that these nuts were consumed in the Netherlands 1497 Opinion on Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni as a novel food, page 5.1498 Opinion on stevioside as a sweetener, adopted on 17/6/1999. SCF/CS/ADD/EDUL/167 fi nal.1499 http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2000/jun/stevioside.1500 Opinion on stevioside as a sweetener.1501 This is what the nuts are called in Vanuatu.1502 This is what the nuts are called in Indonesia.1503 Opinion on nangai nuts as novel food, page 2.1504 2001/17/EC: Commission Decision of 19 December 2000 on refusing the placing on the market of \"Nangai nuts\" (notifi ed under document number C(2000) 3888).-275-to a signifi cant degree. This claim was examined by the Dutch authorities who could not fi nd such nuts. Nangai nuts were considered novel foods. The decision prohibiting nangai nuts was issued in December 2000.1505 This means it took two years to assess the safety of these nuts.The opinion of the Scientifi c Committee1506 was based on similar facts as it was in the Stevia Rebaudiana Bertoni case described above. Again, not enough tests had been completed on the plant.The Committee knew that the almonds were widely used in the Pacifi c region. The estimated consumption of ngali nuts in Western Melanesia was about 60 tonnes of almonds or about 70 g/day/person1507. No particular technology was involved, besides drying, fl oating, soaking and drying again. The Committee also knew that Ngali nuts are listed in the Australian tables of composition of Pacifi c Island Foods and that the nutrient content of the kernels had been analysed. From nutritional point of view, the Committee stated that nangai nuts are practically the same as nuts eaten in Europe. 1508The applicant had performed various tests on the nuts. They had for example tested the nuts for heavy metals and mycotoxins. The Committee would have wanted more information, though. They said not all the relevant mycotoxins were present in the studies performed. The applicant had tested the product for four different afl atoxins, but not for other mycotoxins. According to the Committee, the information on the analytical methods employed when determining the nutritional composition of the nuts was not adequate. Information on the storage conditions of the samples was insuffi cient. The Committee said that the product does not comply with the EU hygiene standards. They were also missing toxicological assessment of the nuts and wanted information on potential genotoxicity of the nuts.1509 Also the allergy issue was mentioned: the possible allergenicity of the nuts had not been investigated.It is interesting how the Committee ends its Opinion: \"no conclusions can be drawn on the safety ... , if the assessment procedures ... have to be followed strictly.1510 Even the Scientifi c Committee of Food, the drafter of the legal texts, did not seem to know whether the procedures, laid down in the Regulation and in the Recommendation, were meant to be strictly followed. They left the door open for the Commission to make the ultimate decision. The Commission then decided that the nuts should be prohibited based on insuffi cient information. This suggests that the Commission answered 'yes' to the question of whether the procedures have to be strictly followed.Noni caseThe application to put Noni (Morinda citrifolia L., Indian mulberry) juice on the market was made by a U.S. company, Morinda Inc., in April 2000.1511 The request to market the 1505 Commission Decision 2001/17/EC.1506 Scientifi c Committee on Food. Opinion on the safety assessment of the nuts of the Ngali tree(expressed on 8 March 2000). SCF/CS/NF/DOS/5 ADD 1 REV 3 fi nal 14/03/00.1507 Opinion on nangai nuts as novel food, page 2.1508 Opinion on nangai nuts as novel food, page 3.1509 Opinion on nangai nuts as novel food, page 3.1510 Opinion on nangai nuts as novel food, page 4.1511 The product in question was not exactly Noni fruit itself, but \"Tahitian Noni\" juice, a fruit juice mixture of 89 % Noni fruit (Morinda citrifolia L.) and 11 % common grape and blueberry juice concentrates and natural fl avours. -276-product was addressed to the Belgian authorities. In the initial assessment report, the Belgians rejected the application and concluded that additional assessment was required. The Scientifi c Committee gave its Opinion in December 20021512, and Commission's decision authorising the product followed in June 2003.1513 This time the procedure took over three years.The Belgian authority had rejected the application based on inadequate toxicological tests: the doses used in the original tests were too low. They would also have liked to know the place of noni in the diet.1514 Member States objected noni juice for various reasons: besides toxicological and allergy studies, they focused on health claims and the medicinal nature of the product.1515Here we can see that the purpose of the novel food regulation was not clear: is it just for determining safety as such? Or should it include assessment of the functional food properties of the food? The fact is that often the novel ingredient in a food is added because of its health effects. This is also the case with our berries: we want to use them in novel functional foods because they have health effects. The question of whether marketing claims are a separate issue from safety assessment is now getting clearer: the new regulation on nutritional and health claims creates a framework for all food claims. The claims are thus not evaluated in the novel food procedure.In this case, the applicant had closely followed the Recommendation on how to structure the novel food application. He had provided the required information of a non-GMO novel food. Concerning the compositional data, the applicant gave a typical compositional profi le of the juice. He also had a Quality Assurance Policy and Procedure Manual to ensure the consistency of products. The samples used for toxicological tests were shown to be representative of commercial products.1516 The applicant had paid particular attention to fi nding possible toxic chemicals, and found nothing.1517 The production process did not give rise to any concerns: it was similar to all fruit juices1518. Nutritional facts were also not particularly interesting: the juice is similar to other fruit juices1519. The microbiological issues were also the same as with other fruit1520.The extent of toxicological and allergy-related data is what separated the Noni application from Stevia and Nangai applications. There was ample data available on Noni.1512 Opinion of the Scientifi c Committee on Food on Tahitian Noni(r) juice (expressed on 4 December 2002). SCF/CS/NF/DOS/18 ADD 2 Final 11 December 2002.1513 Commission Decision 2003/426/EC of 5 June 2003 authorising the placing on the market of 'noni juice' (juice of the fruit of Morinda citrifolia L.) as a novel food ingredient (notifi ed under document number C(2003) 1789).1514 Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 2.1515 Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 3.1516 Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 3.1517 Plants such as Morinda Citrifolia were known to have chemicals called anthraquinones in their roots, and these chemicals were known to be genotoxic. It had been stated in a previous study that these chemicals did not exist in the fruit of the plant. Still, the applicant had analyzed the juice for these chemicals. Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 3.1518 Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 4.1519 Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 5.1520 By applying Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Hygienic Practices (GHP), GoodManufacturing Practices (GMP) and pasteurisation (87.7 degC for three seconds) the product wasto be regarded as microbiologically safe. Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 5.-277-The history of use for Noni is interesting. The plant occurs from India through South-East Asia to Eastern Polynesia. It has a long tradition as dye plant1521, as medicinal plant and as food. Virtually all parts of the plant (fruit, leaf, bark, root, fl ower and seed) have been used for medicinal purposes such as to treat cuts, infl ammations, fungal infections, constipation and diarrhoea. Food use also has a long history: several studies refer to raw or cooked Noni fruit as part of the diet of aboriginal populations of Polynesia and Australia. Some studies suggest that it was eaten only in times of famine, as it tastes and smells bad.1522 \"Tahitian Noni\" juice was at the time of the application already produced on a commercial scale. The applicant had marketed its \"Tahitian Noni\" juice in USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Norway and Hong Kong.1523Lessons of the Noni, Stevia, and Nangai casesBased on the information on two prohibited products, particularly Nangai nuts, it is not enough that the products seem to be safe, based on thousands of years of use. You also have to prove it by various tests. The list of required information in the Commission Recommendation should be considered mandatory. As all of the above-mentioned tests are required before you can bring a food on the market, it is fairly demanding particularly for a small company.It is also noteworthy that in the noni case the Member State would have been stricter, and in the nangai case, the Member State would have been more fl exible than the Scientifi c Committee of the European Commission. In the current system, Member State opinion is thus not a good predictor of the fi nal outcome of the procedure.Based on the above cases, we predict that emblic leaffl ower or products made thereof could probably receive novel food authorisation, provided that we performed all the required tests on toxicology and nutritional values.6.6.2 Future EU Novel Food RegulationTo get a better picture of the novel status of our potential products, we must look into the proposed changes in the EU novel food regulation. In the future, the producers will hopefully not have to avoid the novel food category. The Commission has proposed changes to the defi nition of novel food, to the novel food process, and to the nature of novel food decisions as to whom they apply. We cannot be sure whether the Commission proposal will be accepted as such, but we have chosen to discuss some of the likely issues that might affect our types of product.It is very probable that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will evaluate novel food applications in the future. This has also been supported by the majority of stakeholders. EFSA will have all the best experts to evaluate the safety. The Commission has proposed novel foods to be evaluated in the Common Procedure that is also applicable to additives, fl avourings, and enzymes. In this procedure, the application for authorisation is sent to the Commission, which hears EFSA, and publishes a Community list of authorised foods. Timelines are set for each stage of the process.1521 Its root and bark have been used for colouring purposes. Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 4.1522 Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 4.1523 Opinion on noni fruit as novel food, page 2.-278-We have previously predicted that emblic leaffl ower fruit would currently be regarded as novel food in Europe. This would also apply to some other Chinese berries and plant-based products. The novel food defi nition is not about to be changed. As a result, in the future the so-called exotic plants will still be considered novel in the EU.Instead, the authorisation procedure will be made less stringent and more affordable for plant-based products than for those more technological novel foods. It has been proposed that a simplifi ed procedure will be applied to traditional foods from third countries. This change is welcome by several actors, and will make the situation a bit more convenient for importers of foreign berries, fruit, vegetables etc. The primary procedure has been considered too burdensome, and also as a restriction of trade for exotic fruits.In the future a notifi cation procedure shall apply to our products, more particularly functional foods made of emblic leaffl ower fruits. According to the proposed Novel Food Regulation, \"traditional food from a third country\" means \"novel food with a history of food use in a third country, meaning that the food in question has been and continues to be part of the normal diet for at least one generation in a large part of the population of the country\".A marketer of a traditional food will still have to provide some evidence on safety. The notifi cation shall be accompanied by documented data demonstrating the historyof safe food use in the third country1524. We will need a certifi cate of the foreign, in this case Chinese, food safety authorities stating that the product has been used for a long time without any safety issues arising. \"History of safe food use\" indicates that \"the safety of the food in question is confi rmed with compositional data and from experience of use and continued use in the normal diet of a large part of the population of a country\"1525.In the future novel processes leading to a signifi cant change in food composition or structure will still be evaluated according to the EU novel food regulation.6.6.3 Chinese Novel Food LegislationIn China, a functional food ingredient might have to go through novel food legislation. A novel food might be for example a foreign plant, a newly developed raw material, or an innovative processing technology. The novel food procedure does not have anything to do with health claims. One must always go through the health food procedure if one wishes to present health claims on the fi nal product.The Chinese novel food legislation will not affect our business because the three berries have established food uses in China. This makes them non-novel. For example, wolfberries are added to congee soup1526, and hawthorn is used in haw fl akes1527."
