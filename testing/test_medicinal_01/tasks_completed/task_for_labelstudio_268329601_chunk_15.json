The popular ornamentalBougainvillea is named in his honor.James Cook [1728-1779], English navigator andexplorer. First voyage: 1768 to 1771 on H. M. BarkEndeavour. The crew consisted of 71 navy, 12marines, and 11 civilians. In the party were thebotanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, and theartist (botanical draughtsman) Sydney Parkinson.Second voyage: 1772 to 1775 on H. M. S. Resolutionand H. M. S. Adventure. George Vancouver andWilliam Bligh were on board. The artists were JohannForster and his son George. Third voyage: 1776 to1779 on H. M. S. Resolution and H. M. S. Discovery.George Vancouver and William Bligh on board. Thenaturalist was William Anderson and the artist wasJohn Webber.

Commissioned byLouis XV, his was the first scientific expedition toSouth America (1735-1745). The party of tenconsisted of an astronomer, a mathematician, amedical doctor, an artist, and a botanist (Joseph deJussieu). The principal reason for the trip to SouthAmerica was to settle an argument between theFrench and the English as to the shape of the Earth.Newton had argued that our planet was flattened atthe poles; Cassini that it was flattened at theequator. While there the party discovered a rubberlatex tree, brought out samples of the fever barktree (later to be named Quinaquina condamine), andplatinum. When de Jussieu's botanical specimenswere lost at sea, he went insane and had to be putaway.Joseph Banks [1743-1820], English botanist,explorer, and long time President of the Royal-48-Society. Sir Joseph sailed with Cook on theEndeavour, but refused to go on the second voyageto the Pacific because the ship would not be modifiedto meet his needs. It was Banks who recommendedto King George III that William Bligh be sent toTahiti for breadfruit, and who named Botany Bay inAustralia. The genus Banksia of Australia is namedin his honor.Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander, Baronvon Humboldt [1769-1859], Prussian scientistand explorer of Central and South America (1799-1804). The Baron has been described as the \"lastgreat universal man.\" Darwin called him \"thegreatest scientific traveler who ever lived.\" As to hismission, von Humboldt said \"I shall make collectionsof fossils and plants. I intend to institute chemicalanalysis of the atmosphere and I shall makeastronomical observations. My attention will be everdirected to observing harmony among the forces ofnature....\" Intense! He and Aimee Bonpland (1773-1858) traveled about 40,000 miles, made 1500measurements, collected about 60,000 plantspecimens in South America and they were the firstEuropeans to observe the preparation of the curarearrow poisons. He also investigated the connectionbetween the Amazon and the Orinoco rivers anddiscovered the ocean current that bears his name.After leaving Central America, the Baron had dinnerone evening in Washington, D. C. with another manvery much interested in natural history - PresidentThomas Jefferson! Once back in Europe, vonHumboldt spent 23 years preparing the manuscriptof his 29 volume narrative! Samuel Wallis [1728-1795], English navigatorand explorer (1766-1768). Sailing on H. M. S.Dolphin, he discovered Tahiti in 1767, naming it KingGeorge the Third's Island.Andre Michaux [1746-1803], French botanist. Heconcentrated on eastern North America, sendingback some 5000 tree seedlings and thousands ofseed packets to Versailles. Michaux delivered gifts ofseeds from Lafayette to Washington. He would die ofa fever in Madagascar.William Bligh [1754-1817], English navigator.Bligh was sent by George III to transport breadfruitfrom Tahiti to England. First voyage: 1787-1789(\"Operation Breadfruit\") on H. M. S. Bounty. Thebotanist was David Nelson. The famous mutinyoccurred on 28 April 1789. Nelson sided with CaptainBligh. We botanists are establishment people. Asecond voyage in 1791 on H. M. S. Providencesuccessfully transported the breadfruit plants backto England. Bligh explored Tahiti, Tasmania, and Fiji.He rose to the rank of Vice Admiral in the RoyalNavy and was later appointed Governor of NewSouth Wales in Australia. An edible and toxic fruittree, Blighia sapida, is named in his honor.Hipolito Ruiz Lopez [1754-1816] and AntonioPavon y Jimenez [1754-1840], Spanish explorersin South America. They are known in the botanicalliterature as Ruiz and Pavon. Trained aspharmacists, they collected 55 cases of specimens ofeconomic plants and would coauthor the \"FloraPeruviana et Chilensis.\" A fire destroyed much oftheir material. Ruiz once complained that he hadsuffered from \"... heat, fatigue, hunger, thirst,nakedness, want, storms, earthquakes, plague ofmosquitos and other insects, continuous danger ofbeing devoured by jaguars, bears and other wildbeasts, traps of thieves and disloyal Indians, treasonof slaves, falls from precipices and the branches oftowering trees, fording of rivers and torrents... andthe most touching of all, the loss of manuscripts. \"Mathew Flinders [1774-1814], English navigatorand explorer. He served with Bligh on a secondvoyage to the Society Islands (1801-1803). RobertBrown, a leading English botanist, accompanied himon his exploration of the coasts of Australia. Theartist was Ferdinand Bauer.Meriwether Lewis [1774-1809], personalsecretary to President Thomas Jefferson andAmerican explorer, and William Clark [1770-1838], U. S. soldier and explorer. The Lewis & ClarkExpedition (1804-1806) had as its primary goal thediscovery of a waterway from the Mississippi River tothe Pacific coast. Other, less publicized, objectiveswere more commercial and military, including findingthe best farmland for future settlers in the West.Along the way, the party of 48 collected plant,animal, and geological specimens, and NativeAmerican artifacts. Daniel Boone was asked to goalong, but he declined. The early plant collectionswere sent back to Thomas Jefferson, who sortedthem. In the Bitterroot Mtns., Lewis found the theplant that was later named after him (Lewisiarediviva). The genus Clarkia, of the evening-primrose family, commemorates William Clark.J. S. C. Dumont d'Urville [1790-1842], Frenchnaval officer and explorer of the South Pacific andAntarctic (1826-1829; 1837-1840). George Vancouver [1757-1798], Englishnavigator of the Pacific coast of North America andof the South Pacific (1791; 1792-1794). Dr.Archibald Menzies served as the naturalist. He wasthe first European to collect the coast redwood andto find the madrone tree (Arbutus menziesii).Vancouveria, a member of the barberry family, isnamed after him.Zebulon M. Pike [1779-1813], American explorerof the headwaters of the Mississippi, Arkansas andRed Rivers, and of the American Southwest (1805;1806-1807).Jedediah Smith [1798-1831], American explorerof the Great Basin, Great Salt Lake, California andOregon (1826-1829).Charles Wilkes [1798-1877], Rear admiral in theUnited States Navy. He headed the U. S. ExploringExpedition of 1838-1842. The botanists were WilliamBrackenridge and William Rich. The party visited 280islands and collected 50,000 botanical specimens.The botanical work of the expedition was publishedby Asa Gray of Harvard Univ. Wilkesiagymnoxiphium, a silver-sword relative known onlyfrom Hawai'i, is named after the admiral. It was alsoon this expedition that Darlingtonia californica, theCalifornia pitcher plant or cobra-lily, was firstcollected.Stephen Harriman Long [1784-1864], AmericanArmy officer and explorer of the Great Plains ofNorth America (1820).Thomas Nuttall [1786-1859], English naturalistwho explored the Ozarks, Arkansas River, Hawaii,and California. He was one of the founders of thePhiladelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. Most ofNuttall's botanical discoveries were \"appropriated\"and published by Frederick Pursh. After botanizing inthe San Diego area, Nuttall returned to the East-49-Coast on the Pilgrim, accompanied by one of hisformer students, Richard Henry Dana. Who wasDana?David Douglas [1799-1834], indefatigableScottish collector, especially of horticulturallyimportant plants. By the time he was 28, Douglashad been elected to the Linnean Society, theZoological Society, and the Geological Society inEngland. His specimens are deposited at the NaturalHistory Museum in London. Douglas was the firstEuropean to collect the California laurel, the sugarpine, chinquapin, Ponderosa pine, and the Douglas-fir. He died under mysterious circumstances,presumably being killed by a wild bull in a pit inHawai'i.Charles Darwin [1808-1882], English naturalistand explorer. He served as the naturalist on H. M. S.Beagle (1831-1836), under the command of RobertFitzRoy. Darwin made numerous collections andobservations while exploring South America,Galapagos, Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia.David Livingston [1813-1873], Scottishmissionary and explorer of Africa (1849-52; 1853-56; 1858-64; 1866-71; 1871-73).

Fremontodendron, aCalifornia shrub, is named after him.Richard Spruce [1817-1893], English explorer ofSouth America. He was commissioned by the Englishgovernment \"to procure seeds and plants of the redbark tree, which contains the chemical ingredientknown as quinine.\" He went on to collect 30,000botanical specimens in South America and becomeone of England's best known field botanists. Thespruce tree is not named for him, nor vice versa.Spruce died in obscurity on a tiny governmentpension.Alfred Russel Wallace [1823-1913], Englishnaturalist and explorer of South America (1848-1852). In addition to his explorations, Wallace is alsocredited with originating a theory of evolution similarto the one proposed by Darwin.John Wesley Powell [1834-1902], Americangeologist and ethnologist who explored the RockyMountains (1869-1879).Ernest Henry Wilson [1876-1930], an Englishbotanist who became known as \"Chinese Wilson\"because of his collecting trips to that country.

He wasDirector Emeritus of the Botanical Museum atHarvard University. Schultes was the modern dayequivalent of Darwin and Wallace. His manyexpeditions focused on Para rubber, quinine, and thepsychoactive, medicinal, and toxic plants of the NewWorld tropics. See Davis (1996) for an excellentbiography.-50-SECTION 4 ! TWO MODERN REVOLUTIONS4.1 ! AN OVERVIEW' The first great agricultural revolution occurredthousands of years ago when humans begancultivating and later domesticating plants. Thoseprocesses continue.' After a few millennia, our understanding of plantshad progressed to the point where we haddeveloped two important techniques - graftingand crossing of closely related plants to yieldhybrids that combined desirable traits.' Two highly significant advances occurred in the20th century. The Green Revolution and geneticengineering can be thought of as second and thirdagricultural revolutions.' Both are based on recent advances in geneticsand technology.' Both have already demonstrated great successesin increasing the world's food supplies and thequality of plant resources available to us.' The Green Revolution has also been called the\"Revolution That Failed\" and has been criticizedfor its negative economic impact, especially in theThird World.' Genetic manipulation of plants remains verycontroversial, with critics expressing concernsabout the effects of genetically engineeredorganisms on the human body, on nutritionalquality of foods, and on the environment.4.2 ! THE GREENREVOLUTION\"It is as if man had been appointed managing directorof the biggest business of all, the business ofevolution... whether he is conscious of what he isdoing or not, he is in point of fact determining thefuture direction of evolution on this earth. That is hisinescapable destiny, and the sooner he realizes it andstarts believing in it, the better for all concerned. \"[SirJulian Huxley, 1957]\"We are now in a position where we must not onlymanage our crop plants, our domestic animals, ourfisheries, out forests and range lands, but the wholeglobe is in our care, ready or not, competent or not.We are affecting the atmosphere, the oceans, theforests, rainforests, deserts, and even the climate. Weare woefully unprepared for this awesomeresponsibility. This is an age of great knowledge andlittle wisdom, but we have no choice; we must blunderon. Who is in charge here? God h[eJlapc uks H, awrela anr,e 1! \"992]\"Twenty-seven years ago, in my acceptance speechfor the Nobel Peace Prize, I said that the GreenRevolution had won a temporary success in man's waragainst hunger, which if fully implemented, couldprovide sufficient food for human-kind through to theend of the 20th century. But I warned that unless thefrightening power of human reproduction was curbed,the success of the Green Revolution would only beephemeral.... The more pertinent question today iswhether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to usethis new technology. Extremists in the environmentalmovement from the rich nations seem to be doingeverything they can to stop scientific progress in itstracks. \"[Norman Borlaugh in a 1997 address]TIMELINE: GREEN REVOLUTION1839 U.

' ' ' 'The genetic manipulation of plants and of animals is afairly recent development. After all, the field ofgenetics is only about a century old. Gregor Mendel'swork on garden peas was published in 1866 in arelatively obscure journal. It was rediscovered in1900. A few years later, the terms \"gene\" and\"genetics\" were first used. This does not mean,however, that our attempts to control and to takeadvantage of desired traits in plants is also somethingrelatively new. Grafting is an ancient technique usedto combine the tissues of two or more plants. Theplant that provides the root system and lower portionof the stem is called the stock; the new section ofplant that is added to the stock is called the scion.The interaction between the different genetic systemscan influence the appearance of the plant (e. g. yielda dwarf fruit tree), affect its hardiness, or modify itsresistance to disease. Unlike higher animals, plantshave not developed the antibody mechanisms that canlead to tissue rejection. However, if the stock andscion are too structurally and physiologically different,-51-graft incompatibility may occur. Grafting of fruit treesis very common. On your next Napa Valley winerytour, look carefully at the grape vines. You will seewhere European grape vines have been grafted on toAmerican stocks.Long before we understood the rudiments of genetics,we had discovered the advantages of cross-breedingor hybridization."
