Phosphorylation of p38, p42/44 ERK and JNK, and NF-kB p65 translocation were analyzed by an immunoblot assay using antibodiesagainst the phosphorylated form and based on total protein. Representative images are shown (left A,B). Western blots for p38 MAPK, p42/44 ERK and JNK werequantified using the ImageJ 1.38 software after densitometric scanning of the bands of at least two independent experiments.

NST- not stimulated cells, LPS- stimulated cells, neooleuropein (NOL), 2''-epiframeroside (EFR),hydroxyframoside (HFR), framoside (FR), oleuropein (OLE).secoiridoids named safghanosides are more characteristic of S.afghanica (Takenaka et al., 2002). S. reticulata contains similarphenyl ethanoids and secoiridoids as S. vulgaris; however, thepresence of the iridoid syringapicroside and its derivatives in S.reticulatamay distinguish both species phytochemically (Kikuchiet al., 1989; Machida et al., 2002).In the neutrophil model of the pro-inflammatory state,all extracts and infusions were able to significantly reduceROS production (Figures 2C,D). This is probably relatedto the presence of compounds that contain caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, hydroxytyrosol or tyrosol phenolic moieties,which display antioxidant properties (Bi et al., 2011; Dudeket al., 2017). All extracts and infusions were especially activein decreasing IL-8 production (Figures 3A,B) and, to a lesserextent, MMP-9 and TNFa release (Figures 3C-F). However,the leaf extract fractionation revealed that fraction F2 increasedTNFa production, while fractions F5 and F6 significantlydecreased the production of this cytokine (Figure 4). A similarphenomenon was observed for Echinacea purpurea extracts(Todd et al., 2015). Further bioassay-guided fractionation offraction F6 led to the isolation of the following secoiridoids:2''-epiframeroside, oleonuezhenide, oleuropein, ligstroside,neooleuropein, hydroxyframoside, and framoside (Figure 5). Wecompared the anti-inflammatory activity of 2''-epiframeroside,oleonuezhenide, neooleuropein, hydroxyframoside, andframoside with oleuropein and ligstroside, two well-knowncompounds that are widespread in the Oleaceae family(Jensen et al., 2002). Apart from oleonuezhenide, a dimericsecoiridoid, all compounds exhibited significant inhibition ofpro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine release/production.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 349160Woz'niak et al. Effects of Syringa Secoiridoids on Mediators of Inflammation2''-epiframeroside primarily inhibited MCP-1 release, whileneooleuropein appeared as themost active compound (Figure 6).Neooleuropein inhibited the secretion of IL-8 more significantlythan oleuropein (Figure 6B) and secretion of TNF-a and MCP-1more significantly than the positive control clarithromycin(Figures 6C,D).The mechanism of LPS stimulation of human neutrophilsis connected with a functional response through the activationof mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs): p38 kinase,p42/44 extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-JunNH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) (Nick et al., 1999; Arndt et al.,2004; Simard et al., 2015). Neooleuropein and oleuropeinsignificantly inhibited the phosphorylation of the MAP kinasesERK1/2, p38 and JNK after LPS stimulation (Figure 7A), as wellas the translocation of NF-kB p65 to the nucleus (Figure 7B).Neooleuropein was more active toward the inhibition of p38phosphorylation, while oleuropein more significantly inhibitedNF-kB p65 translocation, and all tested compounds inhibitedJNK phosphorylation (Figures 7A,B). The activation of p38MAPK in neutrophils is connected with the synthesis of TNF-a and IL-8 (Nick et al., 1999). ERK activation also led to theelevated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in humanneutrophils (Simard et al., 2015). In our study, neooleuropein wasthe most active compound in inhibiting p38 phosphorylation,which correlated with a significant inhibition of IL-8 production.However, oleuropein was more active in NF-kB inhibition,which has been shown to affect cytokine gene expression inhuman neutrophils, although it has a less marked effect onIL-8 gene expression (Cloutier et al., 2007). The inhibitionof MCP-1 production by all tested compounds was correlatedwith the inhibition of JNK phosphorylation, which has beenstrictly correlated with MCP-1 expression but not IL-8 or TNF-a expression (Arndt et al., 2004). Interestingly, framoside wasable to significantly decrease the TNF-a and IL-8 secretion(Figures 6B,C) without affecting MAPKs nor NF-kB activation(Figure 7). It appears that framoside, the most lipophiliccompounds, displays a different mode of action. As in humanneutrophils other pathways such as PI3K are also involved in IL-8 production and acts downstream of p38 MAPK (Fortin et al.,2011).The observed significant inhibition of TNF-a and chemokine(IL-8 and MCP-1) production is of special interest for treatinginflammatory diseases such as rheumatic arthritis, respiratorydiseases, and arteriosclerosis. The pro-inflammatory effect ofTNF-a mainly results from its capacity to stimulate theexpression of adhesive molecules in endothelial cells andpromote neutrophil attachment to the vascular endotheliumin addition to their degranulation and pro-oxidative activity(Witko-Sarsat et al., 2000). MCP-1 (CCL2) is able to stimulatechemotaxis of monocytes and cellular events associated withchemotaxis and integrin expression. At high concentrations,MCP-1 elicits a respiratory burst leading to the generation ofROS (Palomino and Marti, 2015). IL-8 (CXCL8), one of themost important cytokines produced by neutrophils, mediateschemotaxis, releases granule enzymes, and promotes integrinexpression and adhesion to endothelial cells (Gabrilovich, 2013).Although the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity ofoleuropein and ligstroside was intensively studied, this is the firstreport concerning the biological activity of 2''-epiframeroside,neooleuropein, hydroxyframoside, and framoside. In particular,neooleuropein appears to an interesting compound for further invitro and in vivo study.CONCLUSIONSThe present study demonstrated that the common lilac, whichhas been traditionally used in Europe as a medicinal plant, is avaluable source of active compounds, especially neooleuropein,for further research regarding their use in treating inflammatorydiseases that result from the excessive activation of neutrophils.The observed decreases in the production of cytokines, suchas TNF-a, IL-8, MCP-1, depend on the inhibition of thephosphorylation of MAP kinases.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSMW, BM, MD, JW, and AK: performed the experiments; MW,BM, MD, and AK: carried out data analysis; AK: plannedthe experiments; AK: wrote the manuscript and supervised allwork.
