Antioxidants, especially the ones naturally derived from plants, have been recognized as excellent source of bioactive compo-nents with beneficial effects on skin, especially to prevent premature skin aging and wrinkling. There is an increasing research interest in polyphenolic compounds which have proven to possess antioxidant activity, and have shown promising effects applied as cosmetic active ingredients (Braunlich et al., 2013).Materials and methodsTherefore, our group developed an anti-age cosmet-ic line consisting of day (D) and night (N) cream, both based on natural materials. Namely, in the stated creams (D and N) black chokeberry and hibiscus propylene gly-col extracts (produced at Institute for Medicinal Plant Re-search) and hyaluronic acid (low weight, Amedeo Brasca, Italy), were incorporated as active ingredients in the appro-priate hydrophilic (D-V, yielding cream D) and hydropho-bic (N-V, yielding cream N) vehicles, in which synthet-ic excipients were replaced with the ones of natural ori-gin. Chokeberry is one of the richest sources of natural an-tioxidants among fruits and vegetables, because of its bio-active components such as anthocyanins, flavonols, procy-anidins, and phenolic acids (Kulling and Rawel, 2008; Ru-gina et al., 2012; Sueiro et al., 2006). Beside chokebery ex-tract, D and N creams contained hibiscus extract, abundant in vitamin C that stimulates synthesis of collagen, a pro-tein responsible for skin tone and elasticity (Aburjai and Natsheh, 2003). Hyaluronic acid, natural component of the skin located in the extracellular matrix, recovers lost skin moisture and gives the visual effect of skin lifting (Scott and Banga, 2015). Avocado oil, grape seed oil and shea butter (all from Comcen, Serbia) included in both creams, effectively feed and revitalize the skin due to the complex of active ingredients they contain, especially high content of fatty acids. Creams contain components of natural wet-ting factors of skin (complex of hexylene glycol, fructose, glucose, sucrose, urea, dextrin, alanine, glutamic acid, as-partic acid, hexyl nicotinate) and elastin (both from Che-misches Laboratorium Dr Kurt Richter GmbH, Germany). Elastin as a protein, is responsible for skin tone, gives it back skin moisturize, elasticity and freshness. Both creams contain a complex of UV filters (ethyl hexyl methoxy-cinnamate, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, ethyl hexyl salycilate, Coning PPI, Serbia) that protect the skin from harmful sun rays.Safety profile/irritation potential of the developed cos-metic products (active creams-D and N, as well as their matching vehicles-D-V and N-V, respectively), was eval-uated using noninvasive measurements of the appropriate biophysical parameters of the skin in a 24-h in vivo study under occlusion.Thirty one healthy female volunteers (mean age 46.09), which participated in the study, were thoroughly informed about the possible treatment effects and the pro-tocol of the examination prior to signing written consents, in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute for Medicinal Plant Research \"Dr. Josif Pancic\", Belgrade, Serbia (Decision No 01-9337-13). The following param-S4 PP 175372Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 371 - 372 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationseters were evaluated: electrical capacitance (EC) (quanti-fying the stratum corneum hydration), transepidermal wa-ter loss (TEWL), as a measure of skin barrier function and erythema index (EI), as a measure of skin colour, using Multi Probe Adapter MPA(r)9 (Courage & Khazaka Elec-tronic GmbH, Germany). All measurements were conduct-ed on flexor aspects of forearms at square application sites of 9 cm2, leaving a site per each arm for untreated control under occlusion (UCO) and without occlusion (UC). The volunteers were instructed not to use dermopharmaceutical and/or cosmetic products on the tested areas as well as to spend at least 30 minutes in a room in which the measure-ments were conducted in order to adapt to the temperature and relative humidity. After initial measurements, 0.016 g/cm2 of the investigated samples were applied, covered with silicone film and fixed with hypoallergenic adhesive tapes. Two hours upon removal of the 24-h occlusion, all param-eters were reassessed (Jaksic et al., 2012; Tasic-Kostov et al., 2011).Results and discussionThe investigated samples showed overall satisfying preliminary safety profiles (low in vivo irritation poten-tial). Namely, two hours after occlusion removal, all the investigated samples led to the significant upsurge of EC compared to the baselines and controls, revealing skin hy-dration potential probably related to appropriate vehicles themselves (D-V and N-V), bearing in mind lack of signif-icant differences after treatment with these samples com-pared to the matching active creams (D and N, respective-ly). There was no significant change in EI, which was even decreased for all the tested creams, indicating well-toler-ated skin formulations. Also, there was no significant in-crease of TEWL for the investigated samples compared to the baseline values, nor UCO. Significant growth of this parameter was detected after repeated measurement for the sample N compared to UC, but this increase cannot be at-tributed to the treatment with this sample itself, while the same difference between test-spots N and UC was also not-ed in the initial measurement.ConclusionIn conclusion, preliminary safety profile of the inves-tigated creams based on ingredients of natural origin can be considered satisfactory. Tested samples did not cause the change in the measured biophysical parameters-TEWL and EI, while they even increased EC i.e. stratum corneum hydration, a feature considered preferable in the cosmetic products intended for the treatment of aged skin.

Bitola, Macedonia* elenanaj@yahoo.comIntroductionIntravenous (IV) fluid therapy is a commonly used in hospitalcare practice as one of the essential element in pa-tient care. Over the years IV fluids in different forms have been specially designed and developed according to the physiological demands of various patient's medical condi-tions. Understanding these IV fluids that are administered to the patient is important because each has a differentim-pact on the body and particular indications for use. There-fore, the choice of IV fluid should be based upon the hydra-tion status of the patient and metabolic disorders associated with the patient's condition. . Ringer's solution for infusion is chemically prepared an isotonic crystalloid that contains sodium chloride, po-tassium chloride, and calcium chloridein sterile water. The dosage of Ringer's solution is dependent upon the age, weight, clinical conditions of the patient, and concomitant therapy.This solution is indicated to replace extracellular fluid losses, to restore the sodium, potassium, calcium and chlo-ride balances and, as well as for treatment of isotonic de-hydration condition In practice, there are different recipes for Ringer's solution composition depending on its intended use. For example, lactated Ringer's solution is a hypotonic solution that the best approximate extra cellular fluid. It may be infused safely in large quantities in patients with condi-tions such as hypovolemia with metabolic acidosis, shock syndromes and burns. It is well known that lactate is metab-olized in the liver, and to a lesser degree inthe kidney while, acetate is metabolized mainly in the muscles and lesser in tis-sues such as kidneys and heart, so it's a good alternative in patients with impaired lactate clearance such as in advanced liver disease (Santoro et al., 2007; Zander, 2004). In general, there are three independent acid-base variables that need to be determined when studyingthe acid-base properties of IV fluids such as: the partial CO2 tension, the total concentration of nonvolatile weak acid (AToT), and the strong ion differ-ence (SID) (Kellum, 2002, 2005). Metabolic acidosis and al-kalosis are respectively caused by raising and lowering AToT while holding SID constant. Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis are respectively caused by lowering and raising plasma SID while clamping AToT. Fluid infusion causes acid-base ef-fects by forcing extracellular SID and A ToT toward the SID and A ToT of the administered fluid (Morgan, 2005). The SID of isotonic saline being 0, the infusion of large quanti-ties (as in correction of hypovolaemia, acute normovolaemic haemodilution, and cardiopulmonary bypass ) will dilute the normal SID of plasma and decrease pH. Using the Stewart equation, a balanced solution with a physiological SID of 40 mEq/Lwould induce a metabolic alkalosis (Chappel, 2008; Morgan, 2005). In order to avoid this inducti; n, balanced so-lutions using organic anions such as lactate, acetate etc. in-creases the SID and also decreases the osmolarity of the so-lution (Bertrand, 2010; Chappel, 2008). Morgan has calcu-lated that a balanced solution should have a SID of 24 mEq/L (Bertrand, 2010; Morgan, 2005). In the field of surgery and intensive care, hyperchlore-mic acidosis is well-known problem in patients receiving large amount of standard electrolytes. A series of studie-shas emphasized the disadvantageous effects of hyperchlo-remic acidosis on various organ systems, for example, he-modynamics, NO-production, renal blood circulation, uri-nary output or hemostasis.Having in mind that there is a lack of Ringer's lactate and Ringer's acetate solution on the drug market in our country, the aim of presented work was to formulate these IV solutions, and to evaluate theirquality and stability. Pre-pared solutions, were used in our Hospital in the Depart-ment of Anesthesiology.S4 PP 176374Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 373 - 374 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsMaterial and methods The minimum conditions required for the small scale production and quality assurance of Ringer's lactate and acetate solutions were established by elaboration of the required Pharmacopoeias monographs (Ph.Eur.8th; USP 39). The IV fluids were prepared in laminar flow cabinet (LFC), using an aseptic technique along with sterile filtra-tion and filled in the sterile containers. Solutionswerester-ilized by autoclaving. The final solutionswerethen submit-ted to quality control, Results and discussion Prepared IV fluids had good quality in respect to phys-ical properties, physico-chemical parameters and microbi-ological quality according to Ph.Eur. 8. It was also con-firmed that IV fluids were stable for a year in the condi-tions of the second (II) climatic zone. Each of these IV so-lutions had a different profile in terms of impact on acid-base status, electrolyte levels, coagulation, inflammation, renal, and liver function. The choice of the best solution for patient resides in a complete understanding of the expect-ed response of each solution and the patient 's risk factors. In the preliminary comparison study, Ringer's lactate as well as acetate- based IV solution, proved to be suitable for fluid replacement during surgery. Hemodynamic stabil-ity remained unaffected by both of the solutions. Concern-ing consistency of acid base parameters none of the solu-tions seemed to be inferior. ConclusionsIt has been revealed that prepared formulation of Ring-er's lactate and Ringer's acetate solutions can be success-fully used for fluid replacement.ReferencesKellum, J.A., 2002.
