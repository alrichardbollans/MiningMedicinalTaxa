      "text": "Liriodendron tulipifera (Magnoliaceae) isnative to the eastern portion of the United States. Itis commonly used in plywood, veneer, wood pulp,wood flour, and it is a favorite of wood carvers.TROPICAL WOODSTeak. Tectona grandis (Verbenaceae) is native to theseasonally dry rain forests of southeast Asia. Its woodis one of the world's strongest, most beautiful, mostdurable, and most stable. It is used in flooring,plywood, veneer, and in a variety of marine situations,including shipbuilding.Mahogany. Swietenia mahogani (Meliaceae) is alarge tree native to the West Indies. Soon after itsdiscovery by Spanish explorers, it became popular forshipbuilding and for fine furniture. In fact, itsbeautifully colored wood is so valuable that we havebeen using other species of Swietenia and othergenera in the same family and other families(Leguminosae and Burseraceae) and calling all ofthem mahogany.Rosewood. This is a collective common name forvarious species of Dalbergia and Pterocarpus of theLeguminosae. Its scarcity these days limits its use forsolid wood items, but it is more widely available in theform of a strikingly beautiful veneer. The Brazilianrosewood (D. nigra) has a red-brown wood with blackstreaks.Ebony. Diospyros spp. (Ebenaceae) yields amagnificent black wood or one that combines blackwith brown, grey, and green. The trees are native toIndia and southeast Asia. It is an ancient wood. TheRomans used to purchase it from the East. In additionto its popularity in luxury cabinets, it shows up inspecialty items, such as door knobs, violin fingerboards, bagpipe chanters, castanets, and guitarbacks.COMMERCIAL TIMBER TREESCommon Name

Heywood, V. H. & S. R. Chant. 1982.Popular encyclopedia of plants. Cambridge Univ. Press. P.329.CORKTypically, bark is removed during processing to get atthe wood that lies beneath it. There is an importantexception. The cork oak (Quercus suber), native to theMediterranean, has highly desirable bark severalcentimeters thick that can be removed from the plantwithout killing it. Trees are stripped at about age 25and cork may be harvested again every 9 or 10 years.The first cork removed (virgin cork) is inferior to laterstrippings. It will be ground up for wall and floorcoverings. Later strippings will be used to makestoppers, etc. About half of the world's cork comesfrom Portugal; most of the rest from Spain andMorocco. Cork has a number of desirable features. Itsair-filled cells make cork light (it floats in water) andthey are poor conductors of sound and electricity. Itcan be compressed without rupturing its cells, whichwill return to their normal size when the pressure isremoved. Cork does not burn easily, nor does itabsorb odors or flavors readily. While rubber andplastics have replaced cork in some seals and gaskets,it remains popular world-wide because there is nocommonly available synthetic substitute.8.4 ! LATEX PLANTSMost of our familiar herbs and trees have a waterysap. A few have a milky or brightly-colored latex thatoozes from the plant when it is wounded. Although noteasily defined, latex is a colloidal mixture of water,hydrocarbons, salts, resins, acids, and various organicand inorganic constituents. It is formed in specializedcells in the plant and often moves in its own separateplumbing system. The function of latex is uncertain.Perhaps it serves to close injured plant parts or tostore nutrients.SOURCESAbout 2000 species of plants contain latex. Severalplant families characteristically have it, including thespurge family (Euphorbiaceae), milkweed family(Asclepiadaceae), dogbane family (Apocynaceae),sunflower family (Compositae), mulberry family(Moraceae), and sapote family (Sapotaceae).-137-TYPES OF LATEXThe basic building block of the industrially importantlatexes is the isoprene molecule C5H8 -- thousands ofthem linked to one another to form polyisoprene. Thedifference in physical linkage is the basis forrecognizing the two basic kinds of latex: rubber is cis-polyisoprene and gutta or balata is trans-polyisoprene.Category Rubber BalataResilient Yes NoPliable Yes NoBounce? Yes NoMoldable? No YesIsoprene units Cis-form Trans-formPANAMA RUBBERWe begin our survey of latex-bearing plants by lookingat one that is probably unfamiliar to most of us. Myreason for doing so is that this tree was the first to betapped by the indigenous peoples of the New Worldand it would later be confused with the much betterknown Para rubber tree.When Columbus and other early European explorerscame to the New World, they found the indigenouspeoples making a variety of useful items from thelatex of native trees. Two species of Castilla, trees ofthe mulberry family (Moraceae), were chief amongthem. Panama rubber, derived from the latex of C.elastica, was used since ancient times byMesoamerican peoples to make solid and hollowrubber balls and figurines, rubber bands, shoes,vessels, and for waterproofing. It also had medicinaland ritual uses.The famous Mayan ball game used solid rubber ballsabout 15-30 cm in diameter and that weighed up to 7kg made from Panama rubber. We have archeologicalremains as early as 1600 B. C. E.Trees were tapped by cutting into the inner bark ofthe tree. Latex flows until the tree is drained. It is nota pretty sight! If the tree lives, it may take months forit to recover. A mature tree can yield up to 50-70 lbs.of latex. Early Spanish chroniclers noted that the latexwas coagaulated by mixing it with the sap of a localmorning glory, Ipomoea alba. The resulting rubbercould then be shaped into a desired form and itbounced. Crude rubber could be stored or shipped byforming it into flat cakes.Panama rubber remained the primary source of rubberuntil 1850 when it was replaced by Para rubber. Itenjoyed a rebirth of popularity as an emergencysource of rubber latex during World War II.The early history of rubber latex and its sources in theNew World is confusing because both Panama rubberand Para rubber were called \"heve\" and their latexcalled \"caoutchouc.\" PARA RUBBER\"Rubber dazzled them, as gold and diamonds havedazzled other men and driven them forth to wanderthe waste places of the world. Searching for rubber,they made highways of rivers whose very existencewas unknown to the government authorities, or tomap-makers. Whether they succeeded or failed, theyleft everywhere behind them settlers who toiled,married and brought up children. Settlement began;the conquest of the wilderness entered on its firststage.\" [Theodore Roosevelt]\"I can assure you that ... when Mr. Wickham arrivedat Kew ... with his precious bags of seeds, not eventhe wildest imagination could have contemplated itsresults.\" [Sir William T.
