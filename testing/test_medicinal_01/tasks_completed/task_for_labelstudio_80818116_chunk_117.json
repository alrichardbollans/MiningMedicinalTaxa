Pers fruit extracts and jamZorica Mrkonjic1*, Jelena Nadpal1, Branislava Rakic2, Marija Lesjak1, Ivana Beara11University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Science, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 3, 21000 Novi Sad, Serbia2University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Medicine, Hajduk Veljkova 3, 21000 Novi Sad, Serbia* zoricamrkonjic@gmail.comIntroduction Nowadays, food industry has a dual role: to provide re-quired nutrients and to have favorable impact on humans' health, protecting them from many chronic diseases. In the lights of that, biological active compounds deriving from plants are attracting more and more attention. Fruits from Sorbus genus are commonly consumed fresh or as tradi-tionally prepared preservatives, such as jam, juice, jelly or wine. The same are also widely used as remedy in a treat-ment of anemia, dyspepsia rheumatism and many digestive disorders. In spite of the widespread use in diet, preserva-tives preparation, beverage manufacture and the traditional medicine, there are still very few reports concerning their detailed phenolic profile and biological activities. Name-ly, within Sorbus genus, the most renowned species are S. aucuparia and S. domestica which are the most utilized as food. On the other hand, other species from Sorbus genus, such as S. intermedia (Swedish Whitebeam) are quite un-explored and the literature data are also very limited. Over-all, plant phenolics are recognized as phytonutrients with significant biological activities which are generally based on their ability to prevent oxidative stress and minimize oxidative cell injury. Thus, the aim of this study was a de-tailed examination of 44 plant phenolics using LC-MS/MS technique and antioxidant potential of S. intermedia.Materials and methodsPlant material was collected in November 2013, in Novi Sad, Republic of Serbia. Five extracts of fruits were prepared: water extract of fresh (WF) and air-dried sample (WD), methanol extract of fresh (MF) and air-dried sample (MD) as well as extract of traditionally prepared jam (J). For preparation of methanol extracts, 30 g fresh or air-dried fruits were grinded and extracted by maceration with 80% aqueous methanol (1 mL of solvent/ 0.1 g of plant materi-al), constantly shaken at 120 rpm/min during 72 h at room temperature. For preparation of water extracts, 30 g fresh or air-dried fruits were grinded and extracted by maceration with boiling, distilled water (1 mL of solvent/ 0.1 g of plant material), constantly shaken at 120 rpm/min during 1 h at room temperature. After filtration, the solvents were evapo-rated in vacuum at 40 degC. Crude residues were dissolved in hot, distilled water (10 mL/g). In order to remove the non-polar compounds, the extracts were washed exhaustively with petroleum ether (fraction 40-60 degC) and concentrated to dryness under vacuum, yielding 9.84%, 26.87%, 6.84% and 31.59% for MF, MD, WF and WD extracts of S. inter-media fruits, respectively. Jam was prepared according to Serbian traditional recipe by cooking fruits in boiled wa-ter and crushing them during stirring. Afterwards, cooked fruits were sieved in order to remove seeds. The obtained product corresponds to definition of fruit puree. Further, in order to prepare jam the puree was boiled and 350 g of sug-ar per 1 L of puree was added. The mixture was stirred un-til appropriate consistency of jam. In order to prepare jam extracts, jam of S. intermedia, was weighed out (10 g) and evaporated in vacuum at 40 degC. Crude residues of jam ex-tract were dissolved in hot, distilled water (10 mL of water/ 1g of crude residue). Extract was then filtered and evapo-rated in vacuum at 40 degC yielding 33.08%. Dried extracts of methanol, water and jam were dissolved in distilled wa-ter to obtain 300 mg/mL stock solutions for evaluation of the total phenolic and flavonoid content, as well as antioxi-dant activity. Additionally, dried extracts were dissolved in distilled water for LC-MS/MS analysis to obtain 20 mg/mL stock solutions. Determination of selected phenolics in ex-S5 PP 231486Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 485 - 486 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationstracts of S. intermedia, was performed according to previ-ously reported procedure (Orcic et al., 2014). For estima-tion of total phenolic and total flavonoid content method reported by Beara et al., (2014) was conducted. In order to examine antioxidant activity of S. intermedia several dif-ferent in vitro assays were performed. The scavenging ef-fect on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), super oxide anion (O2*-), nitric oxide (NO) and hydroxyl (HO*) radical, reducing power (FRAP assay) were tested according Beara et al. (2014).Results and discussionPresence of seven phenolics was confirmed using LC-MS/MS analysis, with chlorogenic acid being the most abundant compound particularly in MF extracts. Further-more, we detected presence of selected flavonols such as, amentoflavone, epicatechin and quercetin-3-O-glucoside in S. intermedia fruit extracts, while there was no prior study which specifically identified mentioned compounds. The total phenolic content in extracts of S. intermedia fruits ranged from 0.10-5.28 mg GAE/g of dw. It could be generally concluded that the highest content of total phe-nolics were detected in air-dried extracts. Concerning the overall flavonoid content, similar amounts were found in all extracts. Having in mind that this is the first comprehen-sive study of phenolic compounds in S. intermedia fruits, the obtained results are significant for further research and could support their usage as food supplement with heath benefits. Generally, the methanol extracts, especially fresh fruits showed the highest antiradical activity in all tests performed. Testing the neutralization of the hydroxyl radi-cals, results showed that the IC50 values ranged from 0.18-0.88 mg/mL. Methanol extract of fresh and air-dried fruits demonstrated a significant, same as standard antioxidant BHT, HO* scavenger activity. These facts are particular-ly important because O2*- react fast with other free radicals, such as NO*, and can cause biological damage occurring in many human diseases. Interestingly, jam extract was good as methanol extract of fresh fruit in neutralisation of DPPH radical, had a higher reducing power of extracts and was more active in neutralisation of NO* radical than water ex-tracts.ConclusionOverall, according to the results presented it could be noted that extracts exhibited some antioxidant activity and jam showed to be rich source of antioxidants in everyday diet. Also, presented results firmly support everyday con-sumption of Sorbus intermedia fruits as food with valuable health benefits.ReferencesBeara, I.N., Lesjak, M.M., Cetojevic-Simin, D.D., Marjanovic, Z.S., Ristic, J.D., Mrkonjic, Z.O., Mimica-Dukic, N.M., 2014.

MacedoniaBujar Qazimi*, Gjoshe Stefkov, Marija Karapandzova, Ivana Svetkovikj, Svetlana KulevanovaInstitute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, University Ss. Syril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* bqazimi2003@yahoo.comIntroductionMountain tea (Sideritis scardica) is endemic to the Balkan Peninsula and is distributed in R. Macedonia, Bul-garia, Turkey, Albania and Greece (Obon de Sastro, 1994). Flowering parts of S. scardica are widely utilized in Med-iterranean folk medicine in the form of a decoction or in-fusion. Various extracts of S. scardica are rich with flavo-noids, phenolic acids, terpenes, phenylpropanoids (Kara-pandzova et al., 2013; Petreska et al., 2011) and show com-plex mineral composition (Karapandzova et al., 2013). However, the specific and particular aroma is maybe the most important reason for the wide use of the plant (Qa-zimi et al., 2014a). Rosette leaves of mountain tea tradi-tionally are not used (Qazimi et al., 2014b), although char-acterized by specific aroma. There are no data about the volatile aroma compounds in the rosette leaves. To ana-lyze these compounds a refined method of headspace sam-pling hyphenated with GS/FID/MS analysis can be uti-lized (Watson, 2005).Therefore, the aim of this work was the determina-tion of the volatile aroma compounds in the fresh and dried spontaneous and cultivated rosette leaves of S. scardica us-ing a headspace (HS) method with GS/FID/MS.Materials and methodsPlant material: The rosette leaves of S. scardica were collected in three different localities in R. Macedonia dur-ing the summer of 2012. The spontaneous samples were collected from Ljuboten (Shara Mountain) and Gurgur-nica (Suva Gora). One cultivated sample was collected from Dren (near Prilep). The plant material was air dried, packed in paper bags and kept in a dark and cold place un-til analysis. Analyses of aroma compoundsGC and GC-MS analyses: 0.3 g of fresh or dried ro-sette leaves was put in sealed vials, warmed for 5 min. and the gas phase (highly volatile compounds) was inves-tigated on Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatography system equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and Agile-nt 5975C Mass Quadrupole detector as well as capillary flow technology which enable simultaneous analysis of the sample on both detectors. HP-5ms (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) capillary column was used. Oper-ating conditions were as follows: oven temperature 60 degC, 20 degC/min to 280 degC; helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min; injector temperature 260 degC and FID temperature 270 degC. 1000 mL of gas phase was injected at split ratio 1:1. The mass spectrometry conditions were: ionization volt-age 70 eV, ion source temperature 230 degC, transfer line temperature 280 degC and mass range from 50-500 Da. The MS was operated in scan mode. Headspace method: Incubation temperature 80 degC; in-cubation time 5 min; syringe temperature 85 degC; agitator speed 500 rpm.Identification of components: Identification of the components was made by comparing the mass spectra of components with those from NIST, Wiley and Adams mass libraries, by AMDIS (Automated Mass Spectral Deconvo-S5 PP 232488Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 487 - 488 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationslution and Identification System) and by comparing litera-ture and estimated Kovat's (retention) indices that were de-termined using a mixture of a homologous series of normal alkanes from S9 to S25 in n-hexane, under the same condi-tions. The percentage ratio of the components was comput-ed by the normalization method of the GS/FID peak areas and average values were taken.Results and discussionTotal of 21 and 24 individual components were iden-tified in the fresh spontaneous (f-Ss) and in the fresh cul-tivated (f-Sc) rosette leaves of S. scardica, representing 96.62-100% and 98.05% of the total content, respective-ly. Data analysis of the chemical composition revealed five different classes of components: monoterpene hydrocar-bons (MH) 40.51-41.97% and 48.49%, oxygen contain-ing monoterpenes (OM) 3.65-4.17% and 4.46%, sesqui-terpene hydrocarbons (SH) 42.07-47.66% and 30.31%, oxygen containing sesquiterpenes (OS) 0.57-3.12% and 0.18%, alcohols (AL) 4.54-8.36% and 14.21%, respec-tively. The prevailing components in f-Ss and f-Sc sam-ples were: b-pinene (21.15-24.79% and 27.63%), a-pinene (11.42-12.69% and 14.09%) and limonene (3.40-7.49% and 6.53%) from the MH fraction; followed by the SH: germacrene D (21.05-21.82% and 14.53%) and trans- caryophyllene (10.86-13.00% and 9.76%), and the alco-hol, 1-octen-3-ol (4.54-8.36% and 14.21%). The represen-tatives from the OM and OS fractions were considered as minor constituents (< 2%). Total of 14 and 16 individual components were iden-tified in the dried spontaneous (d-Ss) and in the dried cul-tivated (d-Sc) rosette leaves of S. scardica, representing 89.36-96.81% and 98.37% of the total content, respec-tively. MH formed 40.32-55.43% and 92.43%, OM 2.99-26.16% and 1.72%, SH 17.6-23.59% and 4.22%, respec-tively. The OS fraction was found only in the d-Ss sam-ples, 10.35-12.73%. The most abundant components in d-Ss and d-Sc samples were monoterpene hydrocarbons: b-pinene (21.25-23.12% and 38.89%), a-pinene (19.07-19.81% and 33.05%) and limonene (up to 6.68% and 13.01%). The higher abundance of OM: trans-pinocarveol (2.99-10.03%), myrtenal (up to 6.37%), pinocarvone (up to 5.09%), SH: germacrene D (4.91-9.29%), trans-caryoph-yllene (4.34-5.90%), d-cadinene (3.03-5.93%), a-copaene (2.47-5.32%) and OS: caryophyllene oxide (6.76-9.35%) was specific only for the dried spontaneous samples of ro-sette leaves. The number of components found in d-Sc was larger than in d-Ss. Also, the share of the classes of compo-nents in d-Sc (MH > SH > OM) differed from d-Ss (MH > OM > SH > OS). ConclusionGenerally, f-Sc and d-Sc contain larger amount of monoterpenes, but smaller amount of sesquiterpenes than f-Ss and d-Ss. Only minor differences were revealed in the qualitative composition of the aroma volatiles between spontaneous and cultivated rosette leaves of S. scardica. Furthermore, there was almost no difference in the chem-ical profiles of the aroma components between fresh and dried rosette leaves, except 1-octen-3-ol, that was present only in fresh rosette leaves of S. scardica.
