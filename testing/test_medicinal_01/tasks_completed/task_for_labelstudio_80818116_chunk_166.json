Traditional-ly, the extraction method of the chemical ingredients in the plant materials is decoction in boiling water. Other meth-ods used are soxhlet extraction and reflux extraction (Lv et al., 2005). Ultrasonic extraction with boiling methanol can be also applied to extract amygdalin from plant ker-nels. The last method is promising, because some amyg-dalin is decomposed into benzaldehyde, HCN, and glu-cose by emulsion (a hydrolysis enzyme present in kernels), and some are converted into its epimers, neoamygdalin (L- mandelonitrile-b-D-gentiobioside) during the process of decoction in water. Other way for inhibiting the conver-sion of amygdalin to neoamygdalin is by changing the pH (adding citric acid in the medium for extraction).The determination and quantification of amygdalin was performed mainly by high-performance liquid chro-matography (HPLC) (Wasserkrug et al., 1997). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the amygdalin content in kernels of Prunus cerasifera, Prunus armeniaca and Prunus domestica, as well as in commercial available food supplement using HPLC method.Materials and methodsPlant materialKernels of Prunus armeniaca, Prunus cerasifera and Prunus domestica were purchased from a green market, while the food supplement containing extract of Prunus ar-meniaca kernels was purchased from pharmacy store. S8 PP 322674Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 673 - 674 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsExtractionThe seeds from the kernels were pulverized by means of a blender. 0.5 g of each sample (including the content from the capsule) was extracted with 25 mL boiling meth-anol with ultrasonic bath under reflux for 30 min. The tem-perature of system was the boiling point of methanol. Af-ter extraction, the extracts were filtered through a filter pa-per in 25 cm3 flask. Furthermore, 1.5 mL of the extracts were additionally filtered through disposable Econofilter 25/0.45 mm RC pore size and injected in the HPLC sys-tem for analysis.Quantification of amygdalin was performed using UV/VIS DAD at 215 nm with calibration standard of amygda-lin prepared as 0.1 mg/mL stock in methanol. HPLC methodChromatographic analyses were performed on an Ag-ilent 1200 HPLC/DAD system equipped with quaternary pump G1311A, column thermostat G1316A TCC, thermo-statted autosampler G1329A TCC, and controlled by LC 3D software (Wilmington DE). Separation was achieved using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C-18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mm, Agilent, Germany), protected with a guard col-umn (4 mm x 4.6 mm, RP-18, 5 mm, Agilent, Germany). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water of HPLC grade in ratio 15:85 (v/v). The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the injection volume was 20 mL.Results and discussionWith HPLC analysis amygdalin was identified in the extracts of the kernels from the samples of Prunus arme-niaca, Prunus cerasifera and according to Rt and UV/VIS spectra corresponding to the Rt and UV/VIS spectra of the peak in the HPLC chromatogram of amygdalin standard. We were unable to identify amygdalin in the sample of Prunus domestica. In the Prunus armeniaca kernels 4.89% of amygdalin was determined, while in Prunus cerasifera kernels amygdalin content was 2.64%. On the other hand, in the commercial food supplement preparation 17.86% of amygdalin was quantified that complied with the declared amount of amygdalin. ConclusionAn extraction procedure and high performance liquid chromatography method were successfully developed and applied for determination of amygdalin in plant material as well in pharmaceutical preparation/extract that can be fur-ther utilized for amygdalin content determination in var-ious natural and pharmaceutical samples. Using, HPLC the amygdalin was quantified in kernels of Prunus cera-sifera (26.4 mg/g DW), and Prunus armeniaca (48.9 mg/g DW) and these data can serve as a starting point for fur-ther investigations and assessment of other natural sourc-es of amygdalin.

Cyril and Methodius\" University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* marjangjurceski@yahoo.comIntroductionPimpinella anisum (Fam. Apiaceae) - aniseed and Foe-niculum vulgare (Fam. Apiaceae) - sweet fennel are tradi-tionally and commercially used in preparing of alcoholic beverages like OUZO, MASTIKA and YENI RAKI which are usually consumed at the Balkan's countries. These kinds of drinks contain an extracts of Foeniculum vulgare or seldom Pimpinella anisum. Sometimes estrogenic ef-fects can be observed when they are consumed by female human population. These estrogenic effects are manifest-ed with stimulation of the lactic secretion, stimulation of menstruation or facilitate birth. In man population can re-lieves the symptoms of climacterium (Albert-Puleo, 1980). One of the components which are responsible for estro-genic activity is dianethol, which is formed after the fu-sion of two molecules of cis-anethole, but there is infor-mation that trans-anethole has also estrogenic effects (Ku-levanova, 2004).There are also some studies on laboratory animals as-sessing the bioactivity of trans-anethole. When adminis-tered orally to immature female rats at 80 mg/kg b.w. for 3 days significantly increased uterine weight to 2 g/kg com-pared to 0.5 g/kg in controls and 3 g/kg in animals giv-en estradiol valerate subcutaneously at 0.1 ug/rat/day (p < 0.001). The results confirmed that trans-anethole has estro-genic activity. On the other hand, some other experiments showed that it has no anti-estrogenic, progestational, anti-progestational, androgenic or anti-androgenic activity. Es-trogenic activity of trans-anethole at high concentrations has been determined by a sensitive and specific bioassay using recombinant yeast cells expressing the human estro-gen receptor (Howes et al., 2002).The aim of the research was to analyze potential estro-genic components like trans-anethole and cis-anethole in alcoholic beverages OUZO, MASTIKA and YENI RAKI using GC-FID-MS technique.Materials and methodsSamples: Alcoholic beverages: commercially pur-chased alcoholic spirit - OUZO; commercially purchased alcoholic spirit - YENI RAKI; commercially purchased alcoholic spirit - MASTIKA and traditionally homemade MASTIKA.Sample preparation: 100 mL of each beverage were di-luted to 1000 mL with methanol and analyzed on GC/FID/MS.GC/FID/MS analysis: Samples were analysed with an Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatography system equipped with FID detector and Agilent 5975C mass spectrometer. For this purpose, an HP-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) was used. Adams' analytical conditions were as follows: oven temperature at 60 degC (0 min), 3 degC/min to 240 degC (1 min) and at the end increased to 280 degC at a rate of 10 degC/min (1 min) (Adams, 2007); he-lium, as carrier gas, at a flow rate of 1 mL/min (at the end of analysis we eluted 10 more minutes with helium with aim to separate some of the components in extract enough well); injector temperature 220 degC and that of the FID de-tector 270 degC. One mL of each EO was injected at split ra-tio 1:1. The mass spectrometry conditions were: ionisation voltage 70 eV, ion source temperature 230 degC, transfer line temperature 280 degC and mass range from 50 - 550 Da. The MS was operated in scan mode.Identification of the components: The components were identified according to the literature (Adams, 2007), and Kovat's (retention) indices determined using a homol-ogous mixture of normal alkanes (C9-C25) analysed un-der Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identi-S8 PP 323676Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 675 - 676 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsfication System (AMDIS) conditions (AMDIS ver.2.1.). Confirmation was by comparing the mass spectra of com-ponents present in the extracts with reference spectra ob-tained from NIST, Wiley and Adams' mass spectra librar-ies. Quantification of extracts components was performed using the normalisation method of the GC/FID peak areas with no correction factors (Adams, 2007).Results and discussionUsing GS/FID/MS analysis five different compo-nents were identified in OUZO sample (2-butanol (5.92%), 1-buten-3-ol (7.65%), anis aldehyde (9.50%), trans-ane-thole (23.98%), 1(1'-azetinidyl)-2,6-dimetil-1-cyclohex-an (8.06%) and 4-metoxyphenyl ((2-methylenecyclohex-yl)methanol), four different components in a sample of homemade MASTIKA (estragol - 7.42%), cis-anethole (42.38%), trans-anethole (35.09%), 3-metoxy-2meth-yl-2H-pyrazolo[4,3,3-E][1,2,4]triazin - 8.52%) and a sin-gle component of trans-anethole in the YENI RAKI and commercial purchase MASTIKA (100% trans-anethole). This indicates that in traditionally homemade MASTIKA and commercial OUZO an extract of aniseed or sweet fen-nel seed was added or plant seeds were used in the pro-cess of production or distillation. On the other hand sin-gle peak of trans-anethole in the YENI RAKI and the com-mercial available MASTIKA indicates that probably a pure compound of trans-anethole was added into the produc-tion process. The amount of trans-anethole was highest in the sample of YENI RAKI, almost twice higher compared with the OUZO sample, two and half times higher than commercial MASTIKA and approximately 5x higher than in the sample of traditionally homemade MASTIKA. cis-Anethole was identified only in the sample of traditional-ly homemade MASTIKA and was present in amount even higher than trans-anethole. This can be explained with the fact that trans-anethole has been converted into cis-ane-thole during the four years period of storage, consequent-ly possessing probably higher estrogenic potency than the other analyzed samples.ConclusionFor the purposes of this research, a method of GC/MS/FID was applied for determination of the target compo-nents, particularly cis- and trans- isomers of anethole, in alcoholic beverages. YENI RAKI has highest content of trans-anethole, followed by OUZO and MASTIKA, com-mercial and homemade. Further research is needed in order to evaluate the relationship between the content of these compounds and their respective estrogenic potential.ReferencesAdams, R.P., 2007.

Cyril and Methodius\", Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* veronikaangelovska@gmail.comIntroductionThe genus Hypericum consists of about 470 species of flowering plants that occur in all temperate parts of the world (Robson, 2003). Well known medicinally valuable species Hypericum perforatum (common St. John's Wort) is native to parts of Europe and Asia but has been spread worldwide as a cosmopolitan invasive weed including tem-perate regions of Canada, United States and Africa, as well. Chemical investigations of Hypericum perforatum have detected several groups of medicinally active com-pounds. The most common classes include naphthodian-thrones (hypericin, pseudohypericin, hyperforin, adhy-perforin), phloroglucinols, catechins and proanthocyani-dins, flavonoids and biflavonoids (hyperoside, querci-trin, isoquercitrin, rutin, biapigenin, amentoflavone), xan-tones (noratbyrol), phenolic acids and other phenolic com-pounds, antraquinone derivatives, as well as essential oils. The phytochemical investigation of Hypericum perforatum essential oil mainly began with the determination of the es-sential oil content. According to some authors, it is a highly variable value and ranges from 0.1% to 1% (Klemow et al., 2011; Robson, 2003) hence this species is considered as es-sential oil poor plant. Concerning the literature data, there have been numerous investigations of the chemical com-position of Hypericum perforatum essential oil."
