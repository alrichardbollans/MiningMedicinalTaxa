From Hippocrates to the modern Phytotherapy.H. SkaltsaNational & Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmacognosy & Chemistry of Natural Products, GreecePlants have formed the basis of sophisticated traditional medicine systems that have been in existence for thousands of years, and their uses by many cultures have been extensively documented. The most extensive source for the study of ancient pharmacology is Corpus Hippocraticum, which contains almost 1500 recipes. Early on, Hippocrates was celebrated as the founder of the pharmacological discipline and his name served as an anchor for the preservation of the pharmacological material. In antiquity, Pharmacology and Botany were intimately linked. Theophrastus's Enquiry into Plants (4th c. BC) includes much information about pharmacologically active plants, while Dioscorides's Materia Medica (1stc. AD), also contains some excellent botanical information. Later on, Galen's Art of Medicine was one the most well-known medical handbooks in medieval and Renaissance times with a tremendous impact on the science of medicine. During the medieval period, the medical manuals were the official pharmacopoeias of their era and had a great impact on scientists in Europe over time, until the 17th century. Among the byzantine physicians, Nikolaos Myrepsos (13th c.) wrote in Greek the largest known collection of pharmaceutical recipes entitled Dynameron with 2667 recipes based mainly on medicinal plants, most of them inherited from classic ancient Greek and Hellenistic periods. The most important point in Byzantine medicine is the compilation of oriental practices and herbal products with those inherited from classic antiquity and its propagation to medieval occident, as many recipes have been copied in later medieval Pharmacopoeias of the Europe. Byzantine medicine is an important bridge for the passage from the ancient Greek medicine into the medieval medicine. Nowadays, it is advantageous to compare the plants quoted in medical manuscripts of the past according to the current scientific knowledge. Actually, among these plants, more than 50 plants are listed in herbal medicines by the European Medicine Agency.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org2620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES KS02. Designing clinical trials of herbal medicines as alternatives to antimicrobials.M. Willcox, C. Simpson, M. Logue, X.-Y. Hu, A. Flower, B. Stuart, P. Little, M. MooreUniversity of Southampton, United KingdomAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing challenge and is already causing 700,000 deaths per year; by 2050 this is predicted to rise to 10 million deaths per year. In many cases antimicrobials are used for minor infections which are self-limiting and in which they provide little objective benefit. Herbal medicines are a possible alternative which may provide symptom relief while avoiding unnecessary use of antimicrobials, thus reducing the risk of resistance. We have conducted several clinical trials of herbal medicines for the treatment of malaria, urinary tract infections, and acute respiratory infections, using a variety of designs: randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of herbal medicine in addition to or instead of a conventional antimicrobial; a factorial design; feasibility randomised controlled trials using individualised or standardised herbal medicine; and nested qualitative studies. The presentation will summarise these designs and lessons learned.It has been feasible to recruit and retain patients to RCTs of herbal medicines for a variety of infectious diseases in primary care both in Africa and in the UK. It is particularly important to ensure that the dose, preparation and duration of treatment are optimised prior to launching a RCT and that good follow-up mechanisms are in place to maximise retention. Choice of primary outcome measure can be controversial. Many patients and practitioners are willing to consider herbal alternatives for treatment of uncomplicated infections, and these may reduce use of conventional antimicrobials, thus reducing the risk of resistance. High-quality evidence from RCTs is needed to inform the choice of the most effective treatments and to provide trustworthy advice to patients and practitioners.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 2720th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021KEYNOTE SPEECHES KS03. Study of the mechanism of antitubercular and antiplasmodial activities of plants and natural products using mass spectrometry-based assays.A.I. CalderonDepartment of Drug Discovery and Development, Harrison School of Pharmacy, Auburn University, Alabama, USAStrategies for developing new drugs to treat diseases include the phenotypic and target-based screening of libraries of natural products and extracts to identify novel bioactive chemical entities. Mass spectrometry (MS) and hyphenated techniques such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have become primary tools in these endeavors. In the last thirteen years, my research group has been developing and applying methods based on qualitative and quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry to a wide variety of assays for profiling the biological activity of natural products. We have developed MS-based bioassays to study the ligand-target binding and profile the mechanism of inhibition. The bioassays were designed using affinity selection mass spectrometry and the MS detector to determine the reaction product of the targeted enzyme reaction. The assays identify natural products, which can selectively target 1) Plasmodium falciparum thioredoxin reductase (PfTrxR), 2) Plasmodium falciparum glutathione reductase (PfGR) enzymes, and 3) Mycobacterium tuberculosis shikimate kinase (MtSK). We have successfully profile Mycobacterium tuberculosis shikimate kinase inhibitors such as manzamines and ilimaquinone from marine sponges, natural products, and plants (Alpinia galanga (L.) Willd. (Zingiberaceae) and Santalum album L (Santalaceae). Oleamide from Guatteria recurvisepala R.E. Fr. (Annonaceae), and other plant-derived natural products, were identified as Plasmodium falciparum thioredoxin reductase (PfTrxR) inhibitors. These MS-based assays are valuable tools to speed up the bioactive molecule discovery in complex mixtures of natural products.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org2820th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021INVITED LECTURES KS04. Modern analytical approaches for Natural Products Analysis.H. StuppnerUniversity of Innsbruck, AustriaThe wide chemical diversity of natural products has challenged analysts all over the world and has been a driving force for the development of innovative technologies since decades. Among the different analytical separation systems available, a predominance of high and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC&UHPLC) and gas chromatography (GC) can be observed in natural product analysis. Although GC still is unmet in its separation capacity, its application is however limited by the need to vaporize samples prior to analysis. Electrophoretic separation techniques such as capillary electrophoresis (CE) or capillary electrochromatography (CEC) are alternatives to HPLC or GC, but its routine use is hampered by Its limited robustness and sometimes difficult manageability. One of the most recent techniques is supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) which is considered as green technology. Unlike initial SFC approaches, using neat supercritical carbon dioxide, modern SFC technology employs mixtures of CO2 and organic solvents (mostly alcohols) as mobile phase which increases the solvent strength significantly. Consequently, the technique could largely expand its suitability and develop to a valuable alternative in modern natural product analysis. In contrast to GC, which in natural product research relies mostly on the unspecific flame ionization detector (FID) to monitor analytes if a mass spectrometry hyphenation (GC-MS or GC-MS/MS) is not realized, analyte detection in HPLC, CE/CEC and SFC can be facilitated in many ways. Besides mass spectrometry, mainly diode array detectors (DAD) and ELSD detectors are used to monitor analytes. Beside a short overview on common analytical techniques described above this presentation will mainly focus an SFC and its applicability for the analysis of natural products.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 2920th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021KEYNOTE SPEECHES KS05. The application of classic and modern pharmacognosy in the study of African traditional medicines.A.M. Viljoen, S. Combrinck, I. Vermaak, M. SandasiDepartment of Pharmaceutical Sciences and SAMRC Herbal Drugs Research Unit, Faculty of Science, Tshwane University of Technology, Pretoria, South AfricaSouthern Africa harbours a unique flora comprising of over 24 000 species of flowering plants. Woven within this tapestry of botanical diversity is the traditional use of indigenous plants as ethnomedicines."
