Its fruits and seeds as well as other anatomicalcompartments (e.g., flowers and leaves) are rich in numerous bioactive compoundsand therefore, the scientific interest in this plant has been constantly growing in recentyears. It has been shown that pomegranate and its extracts exhibit potent antioxidative,antimicrobial, and anticarcinogenic properties. The present review summarizes somerecent studies on pomegranate, highlighting mainly its vasculoprotective role attributedto the presence of hydrolyzable tannins ellagitannins and ellagic acid, as well as othercompounds (e.g., anthocyanins and flavonoids). These in vitro and in vivo studiesshowed that substances derived from pomegranate reduce oxidative stress and plateletaggregation, diminish lipid uptake by macrophages, positively influence endothelial cellfunction, and are involved in blood pressure regulation. Clinical studies demonstrated thatdaily intake of pomegranate juice lessens hypertension and attenuates atherosclerosis inhumans. Altogether, the reviewed studies point out the potential benefits of a broader useof pomegranate and its constituents as dietary supplements or as adjuvants in therapy ofvascular diseases, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and peripheral arterydisease.Keywords: pomegranate, antioxidant, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, vasculoprotectiveINTRODUCTIONPomegranate (Punica granatum L.), belonging to Punica L. genus, Punicaceae family, is anancient fruit native to Central Asia in regions spanning from Iran and Turkmenistan tonorthern India as well as in the Mediterranean area and the Middle East (Holland et al.,2009). Archaeologists have found carbonized pomegranate exocarps originated from the EarlyBronze Age (3000 BC), e.g., in Jericho and from the Late Bronze Age in Cyprus (Ward,2003; Boncuk, 2014). Pomegranate has been highly appreciated since centuries by differentcultures. For example, in Ancient Egypt it was not only a part of the supply of fruitsfor pharaoh's residence (at around 1600 B.C. ), but pomegranate was also painted on wallsand tombs to symbolize life after death (Ward, 2003; Boncuk, 2014). Pomegranate used to84Wang et al. Vasculoprotective Effects of Pomegranateplay an important role in different religions, includingZoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam(Langley, 2000; Jurenka, 2008). It was praised, e.g., by the OldTestament of the Bible as \"a sacred fruit conferring powers offertility, abundance, and good luck\" (Jurenka, 2008). Besidesbeing a part of the mythology and consumed as a fruit,pomegranate has been known for its medical use. For example,the Ebers papyrus originating from about 1550 BC noted thatthe roots of the pomegranate tree were used to treat tapewormparasites (Svenja, 2018). In addition, pomegranate was employedto treat diabetes by Indians (Saxena and Vikram, 2004) and tolessen tapeworm infestation also by Romans (Langley, 2000).The persisting significance of the medical use of pomegranatecan be illustrated, for example, by the fact that in Great Britainthe coats of arms of three royal colleague and the British MedicalAssociation are decorated with the figure of this herb (Langley,2000).Besides native regions spreading from Iran to northern Indiaand the Mediterranean area and the Middle East, pomegranate isnowadays cultivated in subtropical Africa as well as in California,Arizona, and Mexico, as this plant requires high exposure tosunlight during summer and temperature not lower than~12*Cin winter (Levin, 2006; Holland et al., 2009). The pomegranatetree is about 2-3m tall, glabrous, with multiple trunks andbushy appearance. The surface of the leaves is smooth andhairless, with a glossy appearance on the upper part of theleaf (Figure 1). The fruit ripens within 5-8 months after it hasbegun to form. During this process, the color of the externalpart of the fruit changes from yellow, green, or pink to fullyred, pink, or deep purple (Figure 1). An edible juicy layer ofa fruit varies in color from white to deep red (Holland et al.,2009).Studies accomplished over the last several decades showed thatpomegranate and its components exhibit potent antioxidative(Gil et al., 2000; Les et al., 2015), anti-inflammatory (Adamset al., 2006; Rasheed et al., 2009) as well as antibacterial,antimicrobial, and antifungal properties (Naz et al., 2007; Fawoleet al., 2012; Elsherbiny et al., 2016; Wafa et al., 2017). In additionto these in vitro studies, in vivo and in vitro studies showedthat pomegranate exhibits anti-hypertensive (Mohan et al., 2010;Dos Santos et al., 2016; Arun et al., 2017) and antiproliferativeproperties (Albrecht et al., 2004; Malik et al., 2005; Malik andMukhtar, 2006). Pomegranate and its constituents have beentested for their use as adjuvant therapy for treatment of severalforms of oncological diseases, mainly of prostate cancer (Lanskyand Newman, 2007; Paller et al., 2013; Panth et al., 2017; Sharmaet al., 2017). Furthermore, numerous pre-clinical studies havepointed out the beneficial effects of intake of pomegranatejuice or pomegranate extracts in a variety of conditions. Forexample, such treatment improved sperm quality in mice (Turket al., 2008), lowered amyloid deposition in a mouse model ofAlzheimer's disease (Hartman et al., 2006), and lessened neuronaldamage in a mouse neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injurymodel (Loren et al., 2005). In addition, single intraperitonealinjection with pomegranate extract applied to fishes that had beennaturally infected with lymphocystis disease virus, stimulatedtheir innate immune response, and reduced their mortalitydue to lymphocystis infection (Harikrishnan et al., 2010). Inhumans, oral administration of pomegranate extract enrichedwith ellagic acid is beneficial for minimizing ultraviolet-inducedskin damage (Kasai et al., 2006), while hydro-alcoholic extractsof pomegranate have a significant antibacterial activity and aretherefore useful for treatment of dental plaques (Menezes et al.,2009). Many studies also demonstrated potent vasculoprotectiveeffects of pomegranate and its constituents, as presented below.BIOACTIVE CONSTITUENTS OFPOMEGRANATEBioactive substances of pomegranate include, for example,hydrolyzable tannins (gallotannins and ellagitannins), ellagicacid and its derivatives, gallic acid, anthocyanins/anthocyanidins,proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, vitamins, as well as sterols,lignans, saccharides, fatty acids, organic acids, terpenes, andterpenoids, among others. Ellagitannins and gallotanninstogether with ellagic acid and its derivatives are crucial bioactivecompounds of pomegranate (Amakura et al., 2000a; Gil et al.,2000; Fischer et al., 2011a; Borges and Crozier, 2012; Brighentiet al., 2017). Furthermore, ellagitannins and gallotannins arehydrolyzed to ellagic acid and glucose or gallic acid and glucose,respectively (Arapitsas, 2012). In addition, pomegranate isa source of numerous (poly)phenolic compounds (Fischeret al., 2011a). Anthocyanins present in pomegranate comprisemainly delphinidin 3-glucoside, delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside,pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin3-glucoside, and cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside (Alighourchi et al.,2008; Fischer et al., 2013; Lantzouraki et al., 2015), and thecharacteristic colors of pomegranate fruits are attributed tothem. Pomegranate seeds contain different fatty acids with themost represented punicic acid (Schubert et al., 1999; Kaufmanand Wiesman, 2007; Pande and Akoh, 2009; Verardo et al.,2014; Gornas' and Rudzinska, 2016). Flavol-3-ols, flavonoidglycosides, phenolic acids, and hydrolyzable tannins representmain phenolic compounds in pomegranate seed residue(He et al., 2011). In pomegranate peel, gallic acid is a majorphenolic constituent while kaempferol-3-O-glucoside is the mostrepresented flavonoid (Ambigaipalan et al., 2016). Triterpenoidsoleanolic acid and ursolic acid are present in pomegranateflower (Fu et al., 2014). Volatile components of pomegranatecomprise monoterpenes, monoterpenoids, aldehydes, alcohols,and linear hydrocarbons monoterpenes, especially representedby alpha-terpinene, alpha-terpineol, and 3-carene (Vazquez-Araujo et al., 2011; Carbonell-Barrachina et al., 2012). Anoverview of compounds identified in pomegranate is outlined inTable 1.VASCULOPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OFVARIOUS PARTS OF POMEGRANATEREVEALED IN IN VITRO AND IN VIVOMODELSMany pomegranate-derived compounds exhibit a wide rangeof vasculoprotective effects.

Vasculoprotective Effects of PomegranateFIGURE 1 | Fruits, flowers, and leaves of Punica granatum L.(components) have proven to reduce oxidative stress, lipidperoxidation, and generation of foam cells, to positivelyinfluence endothelial cell function (by increasing NO levelsand lowering glucose levels), to attenuate platelet aggregationand diminish hypertension, thus altogether improving vascularfunction, as presented below. In addition, pomegranate and itscomponents are protective against toxicity induced by chemicalsor drugs (Table 2 and the text below).Pomegranate Juice and ExtractIn 2000s, Gil et al. in their pivotal study pointed out thestrong antioxidant properties of pomegranate juice enrichedwith tannin punicalagin, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives,as well as other phenolic substances. Using different analyticalmethods, the authors revealed potent antioxidant activities ofpomegranate juice that were three times higher than the well-known antioxidative properties of red wine or green tea (Gil et al.,2000)."
