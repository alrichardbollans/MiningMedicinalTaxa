Forty female adult rats with induced excision wound were randomly divided to 4 groups to receive topical formulation of saffron, crocin, safranal and placebo for 7 days. The Wound area and histopathologic stage of wound healing was evaluated as outcome measures. The wound area was significantly lower in treatment groups (saffron, crocin and safranal) compared to control group in the 7th day of intervention. Compared to control group, the wound in all treated groups (saffron, safranal, and crocin) showed decreased inflammatory response and more progression to proliferation phase. The saffron group showed more advanced healing phase with complete epithelialization of the wound in 7th day of study when partial and no epithelialization was observed in safranal and crocin groups. The study showed the wound healing properties of both safranal and crocin with the slight superiority of safranal. However saffron seems to be more potent in wound healing effect compared to safranal and crocin as its main active constituents. www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 20920th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP097. Biochemical, histopathological and physiological effects of Citrullus colocynthis L. on peripheral neuropathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.M. Ostovar, A. Akbari, M.H. Anbardar, A. Iraji, M. Salmanpour, S. Hafez Ghoran, M. Heydari, M. ShamsShiraz University of Medical Sciences, IranEthnopharmacologic relevance: Citrullus colocynthis L. (C. colocynthis) is traditionally used for nerve originated pain in Persian medicine.This study aimed to investigate the biochemical, histopathological and physiological effects of Citrullus colocynthis (C. colocynthis) on peripheral neuropathy in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.Seventy male adult Norway rats were included in the present study. Diabetes was induced using a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (65 mg/kg) in sixty rats. After four weeks, the diabetic rats were randomly divided to treated groups by gabapentin, oral administration of C. colocynthis fruit pulps powder (100 and 300 mg/kg/day), topical preparations as oil-based solution and ointment, and placebo for four weeks. The change in metabolic, physiological, biochemical and histological parameters was considered as outcome. Metabolic outcomes (body weight and blood glucose level) were improved in C. colocynthis treated groups as compared to placebo. Tail flick and hot plate tests, as physiological tests, had lower latency in C. colocynthis treated groups. Measurement of oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and catalase) showed the antioxidant effect of C. colocynthis. Histological evaluation of sciatic nerve revealed that C. colocynthis decreased the number of demyelinated and degenerated nerve fibers. Among C. colocynthis treated groups, 100 mg/kg/day oral powder showed the best outcomes.Results obtained from the present study showed that C. colocynthis fruit, by antioxidant and hypoglycemic activity, has a positive effect on the treatment of diabetic neuropathy (DN). It can enlighten the physiopathologic background of previously observed positive results of C. colocynthis in DN.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org21020th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP098. Antispasmodic activity of the fungus growing termite Macrotermes bellicosus used in traditional medicine.D.H. Mahdi1,2, Z. Vissiennon1, V. Ahyi1, K. Nieber2, C. Vissiennon3,41 IRGIB Africa University, Inter-Regional University of Industrial Engineering Biotechnologies and Applied Sciences, Cotonou, Benin2 University of Leipzig, Institute of Pharmacy, Leipzig, Germany3 University of Leipzig, Medical Faculty, Institute of Medical Physics and Biophysics, Leipzig, Germany4 Repha GmbH Biologische Arzneimittel, Langenhagen, GermanyInsects and insect-derived products play a vital role in traditional medicine in many parts of the world since ancient times. Among these insects, fungus-growing termites like Macrotermes bellicosus (M. bellicosus) is used in Benin for the treatment of infectious and inflammatory diseases such as diarrhea and dysentery [1]. In vitro studies reported antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of M. bellicosus [1,2]. However, the occurrence of anti-spasmodic effects remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the spasmolytic activity of M. bellicosus in isolated rat small intestinal preparations using an organ bath equipment with isometric transducer in order to examine the influence on intestinal motility. An ileum/jejunum segment (1.5 cm) was prepared, cleaned and suspended in 20 mL organ baths containing aerated (95% O2, 5% CO2) modified Krebs solution maintained at 37degC. The preparations were allowed to equilibrate for 20 minutes with a preloaded tension of 10 mN. Thus, acetylcholine (ACh, 1 mM) was used to induce control contractions which were set 100%. M. bellicosus extract in ascending concentrations (0.05 - 2.0 mg/mL) was applied into the organ bath two minutes prior induction of contraction. The influence on basal tone directly after extract application as well as the intensity of ACh-induced contractions in relation to control applications was assessed. As a result, a concentration-dependent decrease of the induced contractions down to 41.85%+-6.5 (% control) in the highest concentration (IC50 = 1.54 mg/mL; IC25 = 0.81 mg/mL) was observed. Moreover, application of M. bellicosus extract induced a significant decrease in basal tone down to -1.15+-0.7 mN (1 mg/mL) and -2.07+-2.4 mN (2 mg/mL). The effect was most pronounced in the highest concentration (2 mg/mL, -6.37 mN+-5.5). The observed spasmolytic effect with a suppression of induced contractions and relaxation of basal tone reinforces the relevance of the traditional medicinal uses of M. bellicosus in Benin.

Corydalis hendersonii Hemsl, a Traditional Tibetan folk medicine, protects against acute myocardial ischemia in mice.F.X. Ge, X.C. Zhou, J.J. Li, M.W. Huang, X.L. Gao, P.F. Tu, X.Y. ChaiModern Research Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Materia Medica, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Beijing, ChinaCorydalis hendersonii Hemsl (CH), belonging to the family Papaveraceae, is mainly distributed in the area at altitude of 4200-5200 meters in Tibetan. As one of well-known characteristic Tibetan folk medicine, CH has the function of lowering blood pressure and has been used clinically to treat high altitude polycythemia and vasculitis. Our studies revealed that CH total extract, from 80% ethanol reflux extraction, exerts anti-acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) effects in LAD mice by echocardiography method (EF and FS values), detecting CK-MB and LDH levels, and HE and MASSON pathological examinations. The anti-AMI effect was closely related to anti-inflammatory through regulating NFkB and JAK2-STAT3 pathways. Moreover, the total extract was separated to obtain rich alkaloids fraction (RAF) and poor alkaloids fraction (PAF), through strong acid anion exchange resin. A pharmacological evaluation by LAD mice experiment showed RAF of anti-AMI effect at the dosages of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg by increasing EF and FS values in a dose-dependent manner. The study further expands the potential of clinical application and excavates valuable traditional medicinal resources, enrich the basic research of the traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment IHD, and enhance the national drug innovative research.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org21220th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP100. Bioassay guided isolation of 8-(2\"-pyrrolidinone-5\"-yl)- quercetin from Senecio candicans DC and its gastroprotective effects.M. Deivasigamani1, V. Rajapandian1, H. Lakshmanan1,21 Department of Biochemistry, Karpagam Academy of Higher Education, Tamil Nadu, India2 Karpagam Cancer Research Centre, Karpagam Academy of Higher Education, Tamil Nadu, IndiaPeptic ulcer disease (PUD) encompassing gastric and duodenal ulcer is the most prevalent gastrointestinal disorder. Duodenal, gastric ulcers and gastric cancer are common and serious diseases all over the world. It is estimated that every year nearly four million people are affected worldwide due to peptic ulcer, which accounts to nearly 10% of world population with different aetiologies. Excessive stress, smoking, chronic alcohol intake, H. pylori bacterial infection and chronic usage of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are main causes of PUD. The flavonoidal alkaloids or flavo alkaloids build a quite special group of natural products, where the typical flavonoid backbone (two aromatic rings are combined with an oxygen heterocycle) is linked with a nitrogen containing moiety too. Such group of natural products exhibit interesting gastroprotective effects. Senecio candicans DC is an endemic shrub of the Western Ghats, The Nilgiris, India. The hot water decoction of S. candicans leaf is being traditionally practiced as a remedy for gastric ulcer. The gastroprotective activity of the extract has been scientifically validated and reported that the decrease in lipid peroxidation and subsequent oxidative damage or by free radical scavenging activity may be the underlying mechanism. Further, focusing on the free radical scavenging activity, a bioassay guided approach was adopted to isolate a flavoalkaloid, 8-(2\"-pyrrolidinone-5\"-yl)- quercetin from S. candicans by screening the in vitro antioxidant ability of different extractions and fractions. The isolated was characterized using different spectral studies. The compound was further evaluated for its gastroprotective effects in experimental animal models.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 21320th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP101. Greek edible Crepis species: evaluation of the phytochemical profile, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.C. Barda1, K. Anastasiou2, E. Kalpoutzakis1, A. Kourounakis2, H. Skaltsa11 Department of Pharmacognosy and Chemistry of Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece2 Department of Medicinal Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, GreeceThe genus Crepis L. belongs to the Cichorieae tribe of the Asteraceae family and comprises approximately 200 species most of them edible. Our studies are focused on the chemical and biological investigation of Greek species of the genus Crepis. So far, C. dioscoridis L. [1], C commutata (Spreng.) Greuter [2], C. incana Sm. [3], have been studied by our laboratory, while C. heldreichiana (Kuntze) Greuter and C. crocifolia Boiss. & Heldr. (recently renamed Phytosia crocifolia (Boiss. & Heldr.) Kamari & Greuter) are currently under investigation. The plant materials were left to dry and then extracted with cyclohexane: Et2O:MeOH (1:1:1) and MeOH:H2O (5:1) at room temperature separately. The nonpolar extracts of the aerial parts were set under investigation for isolation of sesquiterpene lactones (SL). The structures of all isolated compounds were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy. The extracts gave a plethora of sesquiterpene lactones. Although, the genus is characterized by guaiane-type SL [4] the last three under investigation species afforded also eudesmanolides and germacranolides.In addition, the antioxidant activity of selected extracts was evaluated by the DPPH free radical scavenging assay. Activity was found in the polar extracts with IC50 values ranging between 0,06-0,26 mg/mL depending on the phenolic content of the extract as measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Further, the most active extract exhibited anti-inflammatory activity in vivo, reducing mouse paw edema by 32%.

Wild edible mushrooms in the order Cantharellales induce apoptosis to A549 cancer cells. Piceatannol was identified as a bioactive compound.E. Vasdekis, A. Karkabounas, M.E. LekkaChemistry Department, University of Ioannina, GreeceMushrooms constitute a kingdom containing more than 140,000 species. Among them, about 2,000 species are considered to be edible. Wild edible mushroom species are appreciated for consumption due to their high nutritional value. In Greece, there have been recorded about 3,500 mycetes, 1,800 from which are mushrooms The aim of the present study was to examine in vitro beneficial bioactivity of mushroom methanol extracts and to investigate the molecular identity of the bioactive ingredients. Thus, extracts of twenty nine different wild edible mushroom species that are traditionally consumed by residents in the National Park of North Pindos in North-Western Greece were examined for antioxidant, antiproliferative, cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activities towards a human lung adenocarcinoma cell-line A549 by DPPH, MTT and PI/annexin V-flow cytometric assays. Certain mushroom species exhibited high antioxidant activity, which was related to their high content in total phenols and flavonoids. Methanol extracts of Cantharellus cibarius, Cantharellus cinereus, Craterellus cornucopioides and Hydnum repandum, which belong to the order Cantharellales, exhibited high cytotoxicity and furthermore induced apoptotic cell death to A549 cells. Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with tandem Mass Spectrometry analysis, using the Orbitrap High Resolution and Mass accuracy analyzer, revealed as an active ingredient piceatannol ((E)-4-[2-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)ethenyl]1,2-benzenediol-3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxy-trans-stilbene). Piceatannol belongs to natural stilbenes and several studies have shown that this molecule possesses significant antioxidant, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity. According to our best knowledge, piceatannol is identified for the first time in wild edible mushrooms. Experiments with authentic piceatannol confirmed the potent antiproliferative activity of this compound. Tested mushrooms are promising sources of bioactive compounds.Acknowledgements: The authors would like to thank the Unit of Environmental, Organic and Biochemical high resolution analysis-ORBITRAP-LC-MS, the unit for technical infrastructure, characterization and testing of bioactive substances of the University of Ioannina and the OPENSCREEN-GR network for providing access to the facilities.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 21520th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP103.
