Wound-healing activity of essential oils from five Hypericum spp. growing wild in Greece.M.E. Grafakou1, A. Diamanti1, E. Simirioti2, A. Terezaki2, C. Barda1, I. Sfiniadakis3, M. Rallis2, H. Skaltsa11 Section of Pharmacognosy & Chemistry of Natural Products, Department of Pharmacy, School of Health Sciences, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece2 Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology, Unity of Dermatopharmacology, Department of Pharmacy, School of Health Sciences, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece3 Laboratory of Pathology, Nautical Hospital of Athens, GreeceHypericum L. is generally classified as an essential oil-poor genus [1], however studies have shown that its volatile oils possess antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiangiogenetic and gastroprotective activities [2]. The most common preparation for the treatment of wounds and skin inflammations is the infused oil obtained from the aerial parts, containing napthodianthrones, phloroglucinols and essential oil (EO); however, there is much controversy in the scientific community regarding the composition and stability of this formulation [3]. Extensive literature survey shows, that, unlike napthodianthrones and phloroglucinols, EO from Hypericum spp. has not yet been evaluated regarding the wound healing efficacy.In the present study, five Hypericum spp. growing wild in Greece, namely H. perforatum (HP), H. empetrifolium (HE), H. triquetrifolium (HT), H. amblycalyx and H. jovis, were subjected to hydro-distillation to obtain their EOs. GC-MS analyses revealed the presence of 137 individual compounds representing 87.8-96.8% of the total EOs. Three taxa (HP, HE, HT) yielded enough EO for in vivo tests, which were conducted in hairless SKH mice. Wounds of 1 cm2 created on the upper back of the mice skin under anesthesia. The wounds were evaluated by transepidermal water loss, hydration, redness, thickness and elasticity measurements, photodocumentation and histopathological examination. The EOs showed high percentages of wound-healing in comparison to the control group (untreated mice) and the Vaseline-treated group, but for HP and HT the inflammation remained. The EO of H. empetrifolium (HE) possesses significant wound healing properties, as it was indicated by clinical evaluation and histopathological results. This later result confirms the traditional use of HE in Greece for wounds and skin inflammations [4]. [1] Crockett S.L., 2010. Nat. Prod. Commun. 5, 1493-1506. [2] Guedes A. et al, 2012. Phytochem.

Regulation of glutathione biosynthesis by the addition of Allium hookeri in the diet and its role in the prevention of metabolic syndrome.B. Deka1,2, P. Manna1, J.C Borah1, N.C Talukdar1,21 Biochemistry and Drug Discovery Lab, Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST) PaschimBoragaon, Guwahati-35, India2 Cotton University, Panbazar, Guwahati-01, IndiaOxidative stress resulting from the depletion of glutathione (GSH) level plays an important role in the generation of various degenerative diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D). We tested the hypothesis that depleted level of GSH may be enhanced through the supplementation of cysteine rich medicinal herb in High fat High fructose (HF-HFr) diet induced diabetic rats. Male SD rats were divided three groups (n=6), namely Normal diet, HF-HFr diet, and HF-HFr diet along with methanolic leaf extract (250 mg/kg) of our plant of interest. The experiment was carried out for 20 weeks. In vitro study was performed by using rodent L6 muscle cell line. Compared with the diabetic group, the plant extract treated group showed a significant lower blood glucose level and higher GSH and lower GSSG (glutathione disulfide) levels in skeletal muscle tissues. Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were found to be higher in the diabetic group while the treated group showed a significant lower level of FFA. The protein expression of GCLC, GR, and GLUT4 were also upregulated in the skeletal muscle tissues of the treated group compared to HF-HFr group. In vitro studies further demonstrated the beneficial effect of the plant extract in increasing glucose uptake and GSH levels and decreasing GSSG levels in sodium palmitate (0.75 mM) treated cells. Combining all, this study suggests that exposure to HF-HFr diet caused an increased accumulation of FFA followed by increased blood glucose level and diminished GSH level. Dietary supplementation with cysteine rich herb can restore the GSH level leading to lower accumulation of FFA and controlled blood glucose level.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org 9720th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsO31. Efficacy of honey-based ophthalmic formulation in patients with corneal ulcer: A randomized clinical trial.M. Nejabat, K. Soltanzadeh, M. Yasemi, S. Daneshamouz, AR Akbarizadeh, M. HeydariShiraz University of Medical Sciences, IranHoney is traditionally used for infectious ulcers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of honey-based ophthalmic drop in patients with foreign body induced corneal ulcer. Honey is traditionally used for the skin, mucosal and corneal ulcers. Its use is well studied in human skin and mucosal ulcers and animal model of corneal ulcer with promising effects. In this randomized clinical trial, 50 patients with foreign body induced corneal ulcer were allocated to receive 70% sterile honey-based ophthalmic formulation or 0.3% ophthalmic ciprofloxacin, as the standard treatment every 6 hours. Moisture content, pH, electrical conductivity and hydroxymethylfurfural content of honey sample was measured according the method previously described by the association of analytical chemists international. Moisture was determined according to the correlation between honey moisture and refractive index. pH was measured by means of a potentiometric pH-metre in a 70% honey solution. Electrical conductivity was measured by a conductimeter. Hydroxymethylfurfural was determined applying reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and UV detection. All patients were examined for the size of corneal epithelial defect, corneal infiltration and depth and followed on a daily basis until complete healing. Duration for complete healing was considered as the outcome measure. Smear, culture, antibiogram and minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) test were performed for honey and ciprofloxacin in all patients. The average durations of complete healing of corneal epithelial defect in the honey and ciprofloxacin groups were 3.88 +- 3.44 vs. 6.32 +- 3.69 days, respectively (p=0.020). No significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the average duration of healing of corneal infiltration (8.12 +-1.94 days vs. 8.64+-2.15 days, p=0.375). MIC of honey for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 60% w/w, for E.Coli 40% w/w, and for staphylococcus aureus 30% w/w. Honey based ophthalmic drop can accelerate the corneal epithelial defect healing in patients with foreign body induced corneal ulcer, compared to ophthalmic ciprofloxacin as the standard treatment.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org9820th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021ORAL PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsO32. Antiprion effects of naturally occurring compounds.S. Pettas1, K. Karagianni1, A. Karsanidou2, E. Kanata2, A. Karioti3, N. Bekas1, A. Sachinidis2, A.K. Kanellis4, D. Dafou1, K. Xanthopoulos2, T. Sklaviadis21 Department of Genetics, Development and Molecular Biology, Laboratory of Developmental Biology, School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece 2 Neurodegenerative Diseases Research Group, Laboratory of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece3 Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece4 Group of Biotechnology of Pharmaceutical Plants, Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GreeceTransmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative diseases afflicting a wide variety of hosts, including humans. The common pathogen, termed Prion, is believed to consist primarily or exclusively of the abnormally folded isoform (PrPSc) of a highly conserved protein (PrPC). Although the exact pathogenetic mechanism remains elusive, PrPSc drives the generation of novel PrPSc molecules, through the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc, thus promoting disease progression.Neuropathological hallmarks of TSEs include spongiform degeneration, gliosis and neuronal death. Behavioral and visual disturbances, gait or limb ataxia, myoclonus and aphasia are common clinical signs. In humans clinical disease progresses rapidly (mean: 4-6months) and results in death [1].Although several therapeutic approaches have been evaluated to prevent and/or treat TSEs, ranging from small molecules to antibodies and RNAi targeting PrP, TSEs remain incurable, rendering the need for novel therapeutics clear and still unmet [2].In this project we evaluated the naturally occurring compounds, carnasol (CR), carnasolic acid (CA) and myrtillin for their antiprion effect. CR and CA are isolated from Rosmarinus officinalis and have been associated with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects [3]. Myrtillin and other anthocyanins are abundant in Vaccinium and Vitis species and have similar beneficial health effects [4].To evaluate the antiprion effects of the compounds, we utilized ScN2a, a cell line persistently infected with prions, and confirmed the antioxidative effects of CA and CR, exerted through upregulation of the Keap/Nrf2 pathway, by qPCR. Moreover, we established a novel antiprion effect, evidenced by the reduction in PrPSc accumulation in prion-infected cells. This effect appears to be direct, as CA, CR and myrtillin blocked de novo generation and reduced already formed PrPSc aggregates in RT-QuiC, cell-free experiments. These data imply a protective and possibly therapeutic role for the compounds tested, which could evolve into much-needed agents against TSEs. [1] Colby, D.W. and S.B. Prusiner, Prions.

FT-IR spectroscopy as a green analytical technique to screen the botanical origin of essential oils rich in 1,8-cineole.M. Papapostolou1, S. A. Ordoudi1, S. Kokkini2, M. Z. Tsimidou11 Laboratory of Food Chemistry & Technology, School of Chemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece2 Laboratory of Systematic Botany & Phytogeography, School of Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece Eucalyptol (1,8-cineole) is the major volatile constituent of some essential oil (EO) products like those from eucalyptus and bay laurel that are highly appreciated in the flavor market. It is also present in a wide variety of other popular EOs like those from rosemary, sage, cardamom etc. Some of these products may differ greatly in price or bear similar olfactory notes so that may be used for fraudulent practices like admixing and mislabeling [1]. Identification of the botanical origin of the EOs is a challenging area of research for authenticity purposes mainly because of the great variability in their chemical composition [2], usually examined through GC analyses. Among the most versatile, fast and cost-effective analytical techniques, Fourier-transform mid infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics has attracted great interest for evaluation of different quality aspects e.g. grading according to their content in major volatile constituents [3] but also detection of counterfeit [4]. In the present study, the transmission FT-IR spectra of commercial \"eucalyptus\" (n=5), \"bay laurel\" (n=11), \"sage\" (n=2) and \"rosemary\" (n=1) as well as \"melissa\" (n=2) EOs were pre-processed and then evaluated against a reference spectral database for authentic Laurus nobilis L. (bay laurel) EOs of highly varying relative contents in 1,8-cineole (ca. 25-50% v/v). The objective was to explore for possible diagnostic markers about the botanical origin of a given EO product. The FT-IR spectral bands between 1355-1375 cm-1, 1680, and 1730-1750 cm-1 were found as the most promising ones for possible discrimination of various -rich in 1,8-cineole- EOs according to their botanical origin. Complementary GC-FID-MS analyses revealed that the above regions are associated with compounds barely found in bay laurel EO like camphor, b-thujone or citral. These findings support the exploitation of FT-IR as a green analytical technique to screen the botanical origin of 1,8-cineole-chemotyped EOs.
