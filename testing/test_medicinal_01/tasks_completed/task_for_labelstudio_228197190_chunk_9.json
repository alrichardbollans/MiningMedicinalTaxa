      "text": "Dr. Chansarkar was introduced to the researcher during a field trip to Kerala in April 2014, where he explained how according to Ayurveda the build-up of gasses (digestive impurities) in the alimentary canal feedback and signal pain receptors which are recognised as a headache. According to Dr. Chansarkar a headache is a sign that there is insufficient clearing of the digestive tract. He recommended a digestive aid (Triphala- a mixture of amla, beleric and harad) to help clear the gastro-intestinal tract in order to eliminate the headache. Ajwain is a bitter tasting, aromatic seed that is rich in essential oils which contain thymol. It is commonly used in cooking to add flavour and has numerous health benefits; it is a popular digestive aid which can help with gastro-intestinal ailments (i.e. flatulence, diarrhoea, and indigestion) and provides anti-spasmodic, laxative, and pain relief effects (Bairwa et al., 2012). It appears many of the research participants in this study who treated headaches with a digestive aid were aware of this traditional knowledge which is not well documented. Indigestion is a common ailment which causes a discomfort in the upper abdomen, often associated with a bloated sensation, nausea and excessive belching. It was uncovered that SA communities in this research used the term 'gas' to describe these symptoms. The pathophysiology is the same; participants had a clear understanding of what indigestion was and how to treat it. Indigestion may be experienced due to eating 'heavy' meals (large portions, high fat or fried foods), stress, medication, or because of poor metabolism. From 55 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra the results (Figure 2-19) it is clearly a condition many of the participants have knowledge of how to treat; 66% of participants (n=127) surveyed stated one or more herbal remedies to treat indigestion. Remedies including: ajwain, black salt, cardamom, fennel, lemon water, mint, milk, hing, and churan were recommended for treating indigestion. Churan (also known as churna) is a digestive powder composed of several ingredients including ginger, cumin, ajwain, rock salt, black pepper, fenugreek, hing, and fennel; although, different manufacturers may have their own recipes (Chaudhury and Rafei, 2001). There are a variety of commercial products available for itchy skin which are based on HMs. Most of the products recommended by participants for itchy skin were topical preparations such as the sap from the aloe vera plant rubbed onto the skin (mentioned by 35% of respondents, n=27), oils (almond, coconut, mustard, and olive oil) and pastes (turmeric with yoghurt or olive oil, crushed garlic, onion juice, or a mixture of honey and cinnamon). A large number of participants (40%, n=31) suggested using an oil to stop the itching as it would moisturise the skin and reduce the dryness, which makes the itch-scratch cycle worse (Yosipovitch and Hundley, 2004). Other remedies were formulated to be ingested to provide systemic relief from the itching such as: turmeric in milk several times a week, dried neem leaves mixed with honey to make small balls taken daily, neem leaves infused in warm water or tea. The final condition participants were asked to detail a herbal remedy for was wounds; 98 participants (51%) stated a remedy they knew of which could be used for wounds. A considerable number of participants (77%, n=75) listed the benefits of turmeric for aiding wound healing. There were several methods of preparation and administration noted. Some participants claimed turmeric should be made in to a drink by warming with milk and drinking it every night; some recommended adding black pepper, clarified butter (ghee) or olive oil. While others preferred to use a topical formulation to give a local effect by making a paste with oil (e.g. olive oil or mustard oil), ghee, or water. The medicinal value of turmeric is undergoing extensive investigation. It has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory action which may explain its traditional use in wound healing. The antimicrobial function prevents bacterial proliferation when the skins defences have been breached; while the anti-inflammatory action will help the wound heal quicker (Colalto, 2010). Various other topical and internal preparations were also recommended for wounds including: the use of neem, honey, aloe vera and some even suggested rubbing salt directly into a wound to stop it bleeding. A list of the herbal remedies documented by participants can be found in Appendix 5. 56 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Participants' Knowledge of Herbal Medicines Participants' knowledge of HMs was measured by calculating the total number of 'items' recalled; this included any ingredients, products or remedies participants mentioned throughout the entire survey. Each response was given a value of one and this was added up to give the total number of items recalled, if an item was mentioned several times it was only counted once. Figure 2-21 illustrates the total number of items recalled increased as more questions were asked in comparison to Figure 2-17, which just looked at participants responses from question 8A. The proportion of participants who did not state any herbal products reduced from 7% (n=13) to 5% (n=10); while, those who recalled twenty or more items increased from 3% (n= 6) to 10% (n=19). The reason for an increased number of items recalled could be due to the prompts given, i.e. asking participants' to identify medicinal plants or products for specific health conditions (Harris and Brown, 2010); or even because participants had more time to think about herbal remedies as the questionnaire progressed. Question eight alone would not be sufficient to judge the participants knowledge of HMs; but, by having additional sections and questions a better indication of knowledge can be assessed. The results demonstrate that there was a great wealth of knowledge of HMs amongst the research sample. There are various parametric techniques which can be used to explore the relationships between variables in this data. For example, a t-test can be used when there are two defined groups in a variable; i.e. it can be used to explore the relationship between the difference in knowledge across male and female participants. While analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques can be employed when there are two or more groups within a variable; i.e. to determine the difference in knowledge across the different age groups (Pallant, 2007). 051015200 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 +Number of participantsNumber of items recalled Participants Total Knowledge of Herbal MedicinesFigure 2-21 SATMED Participants' Total Knowledge of Herbal Medicines 57 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Independent sample t-test An independent sample t-test can be used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between two variables. It can be used to explore the differences in the mean number of responses between male and female respondents. Table 2-3 identifies the number of male and female participants (N), and summarises the mean (M) number of items recalled for each group, along with the standard deviation (SD). The mean number of responses per female participant was 11 (SD = 7.01), and for male participants M = 7 (SD = 6.18). From this it can be concluded that the male participants recalled fewer items but there was less variance in their results. Table 2-3 T-test Group Statistics Gender N Mean number or responses Standard Deviation Male 60 7 6.18 Female 132 11 7.01 Table 2-4 Independent Samples T-test The first part of Table 2-4 indicates the 'Levene's Test for Equality of Variances' which tests whether the variation for the two groups is the same. If the significance probability (Sig) value (P) is greater than 0.05 then results from 'equal variances assumed' should be used; whereas a lower Sig value indicates results from 'equal variances not assumed' should be used. In this instance the Sig value is 0.131, as this is larger than the standard of 0.05, equal variances can be assumed (Pallant, 2007). The Sig. (2-tailed) result is then used to see if there is a significant difference between the two groups (i.e. male and female participants), if this value is equal to or less than 0.05 it suggests there is a significant difference between the means of the two genders, whereas a higher value would suggest there is no significant difference. Table 2-4 shows that the Sig (2-tailed) value p = 0.001, this is lower than the Independent Samples Test Levene's Test for Equality of Variances t-test for Equality of Means F Sig. t df Sig. (2-tailed) Mean Difference Standard Error Difference 95% Confidence Interval of the Difference Lower Upper Equal variances assumed 2.297 0.131 3.386 190 0.001 3.565 1.053 1.488 5.642 Equal variances not assumed 3.550 128 0.001 3.565 1.004 1.578 5.552 58 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra standard 0.05; therefore, this indicates there is a significant difference between the mean number of items recalled by male and female participants (Pallant, 2007; Petrovics, 2012). Effect size statistics can then be used to provide an insight into the strength of the association to show that the results have not just occurred due to chance, as well as highlighting the statistical significance (Pallant, 2007; Petrovics, 2012). Eta squared is one way of calculating the effect size statistic. The eta squared value can range from 0 to 1 and can be interpreted in the following way: 0.01 is a small effect, 0.06 is a moderate effect, and 0.14 is a large effect (Cohen, 1988). The following formula is used to calculate eta squared: Eta squared = ________t2_______ t2 + (N12 + N2 - 2) Eta squared = ________3.3862_______ 3.3862 + (60 + 132 - 2) = 0.06 The eta squared value of 0.06 suggests there is a moderate association, that this is a significant finding and not just because of chance. In summary, the results from of the t-test and eta square confirm there is a difference in knowledge between the two genders; female participants had more knowledge of HMs in comparison to male participants. This is supported by the Mintel Report (2009), which claims women have more knowledge of HMs, thus they use them more than men. Furthermore, Ernst (2000) also states that women of all ages use HMs more frequently than men. Male participants in this investigation claimed they did not take any HMs for their health (in question 1), but later revealed they did take HMs given to them by their grandparents, mother or wife (question 6). This supports the nurturing role females have been associated with throughout history (Ehrenreich and English, 1973; Hegg, 2013). The traditional role for SA women was as the house keeper; which involved cooking and looking after their husband and children once they started their own families (Samanta, 1999; Chaudhury and Rafei, 2001). As women were the ones who have traditionally been the main cooks in the home they were best equipped with the knowledge of how to use food as medicines (Jennings, 2014). This nursing and caring role women have been traditionally associated with is evidently still common amongst SA communities in the UK; where female participants appear to have more knowledge of HMs than males. 59 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Analysis of Variance An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests the hypothesis that the means of two or more variables are equal (Minitab Inc, 2014). It compares the variance between the groups, enabling conclusions to be made regarding variations among results (Pallant, 2007). A one-way ANOVA can be used to compare the variance between groups in an independent variable; for example; how knowledge (dependent variable) varies with age (independent variable). The Null hypothesis would be that knowledge is equal despite age; while the Alternative hypothesis would be that there is a difference in knowledge between the age groups. Table 2-5 summarises the mean number of responses given by each age group, with the standard deviation, standard error, and 95% confidence intervals for the mean. Table 2-5 ANOVA Summary of Participants Age and Mean Number of Herbal Medicines Recalled Age N Mean Standard Deviation Standard Error 95% Confidence Interval for Mean Lower Bound Upper Bound 20 or under 43 6 6.121 0.933 4.77 8.54 21 - 30 years 47 8 5.207 0.760 6.88 9.93 31 - 40 years 10 12 5.633 1.781 8.77 16.83 41 - 50 years 12 13 11.156 3.220 6.50 20.67 51 - 60 years 21 13 7.423 1.620 9.62 16.38 61 years + 59 12 6.346 0.826 10.55 13.86 Total 192 10 6.945 0.501 9.25 11.22 Table 2-5 identifies that the mean number of responses increases with age. A potential reason for the slightly lower mean for the 61+ age group is because during data collection it was noted that some of the older participants were reluctant to share their knowledge or take HMs at the same time as taking Western medicines. As reflected by participant 125, 'I do not want to tell anyone about any herbal remedies as if something goes wrong people will blame me. I have so much knowledge about herbal remedies but I am scared to share it, in this country people do not want to know!' In addition, many of the participants in the 61+ age group took prescription medicines for various health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and commented on how they had stopped using HMs. This was mentioned by several participants including participant 112 who claimed, 'I do not take any herbal remedies, I only take the doctors medicines because I have to,' and participant 115 who said, ''I do not really use much herbal remedies now, I just take my prescription medicines.'' 60 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 2-6 ANOVA Summary of Variance between Participants Age and Number of Responses Sum of Squares Degrees of freedom Mean Square F Sig. Between Groups 1299.291 5 259.858 6.108 0.00003 Within Groups 7913.163 186 42.544 Total 9212.453 191 - Table 2-6 represents the results of the ANOVA test which shows the sum of squares, which is a measure of variation or deviation from the mean, and degrees of freedom (Minitab Inc, 2014). If the Sig value is less than or equal to 0.05 there is a significant difference among the mean scores of the dependent variable. The sig value indicated in Table 2-6 is 0.00003; consequently this shows there is a significant difference in the mean results. The F test represents the variance between the groups divided by the variance within each group. A significant F ratio would suggest there is more variability between the groups, due to the independent variable (i.e. the total knowledge) than there is within the group. If the F value is around 1 we can assume the null hypothesis is correct (Pallant, 2007). Table 2-6 identified that the F value is 6.108 thus the null hypothesis, that there are no significant differences in number of responses between the different age groups, needs to be rejected; while, the Alternative hypothesis, that there is a difference in knowledge between the age groups, can be accepted. To calculate the effect size the following formula can be used: Eta squared = Sum of squares between groups = 1299.291 Total sum of squares 9212.453 = 0.14 The one-way between-groups ANOVA was conducted to explore the impact of age on total knowledge (i.e. the number of herbal remedies participants recalled). The results show there was a statistically significant difference as p < 0.05 and F test results show: p = 0.0003, F = 6.108. The effect size calculated using Eta squared, was 0.14 indicating a large effect; reinforcing a statistically significant result, that knowledge was different across the various age groups (Pallant, 2007). The results of the ANOVA test suggest there is a difference in knowledge of HMs amongst the different age groups. Although, the knowledge of HMs is transmitted to younger SA generations in the UK, as exemplified by their responses throughout this investigation, the older participants still had more knowledge of HMs. This is supported by Pieroni et al. (2010) who also found that middle-aged and older Bangladeshi 61 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra participants in their research had better knowledge of traditional HMs than younger participants. 2.6.3 The Use of Prescription Medication This section of the questionnaire set out to investigate whether or not participants took prescribed CWM alongside HMs. Participants were asked what CWM they were prescribed by their doctor, nurse, pharmacist or other HCPs, to explore the safety of consuming HMs, and the potential interactions between HMs and CWM. Participants were asked whether or not they shared information about their use of HMs with their HCPs, to gain insight into the relationship between SA patients and their HCPs. In addition, the side-effects reported from CWM and HMs were compared. Question 10 A: Do you take any regular prescribed medicines? 10 B: If Yes, and you are happy to say please state what medicines you take. All of the research participants (n=192) were asked whether or not they took any regular prescribed medicines; of which more than half of the population (55%, n=106) stated they did. This included the treatment for a range of health problems including: pain relief, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, topical treatments for skin conditions, and vitamins to supplement deficiencies (Table 2-7)."
