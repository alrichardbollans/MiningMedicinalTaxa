The European Court of Justice has stated that WTO agreements are not intended to confer rights on individuals. It has still found some situations where private parties are allowed to rely on WTO agreements as interpreted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. According to Pere, these situations are limited in applicability and leave important gaps to rights of private persons. Although WTO law is binding, it seems to lack effective remedies. A company cannot necessarily receive any compensation for damage suffered due to a Member State not complying with their WTO obligations or as a result of countermeasures to such WTO-illegal action.1425The relationship between WTO law and Chinese law is similar: if China has failed to meet a WTO obligation, a private company can probably not resort to WTO law against the Chinese government. When China adjoined the WTO, there was academic debate on whether PRC courts should directly apply WTO agreements1426. According to Jie, there are no clear rules on the hierarchy between Chinese laws and treaties. The ambiguous hierarchy is deliberate, leaving room for discretion for Chinese legislators and courts.14276.3.2 EUWhen in Europe, one must fi rst look into the Community level Regulations and Directives. With foodstuffs, the General Food Regulation gives general principles on producer responsibilities. Concerning functional foods, the Novel Food Regulation and the Regulation on Nutrition and Health Claims are often relevant. With medicines, the Medicinal Products Directive is the most important one. The directive was recently amended with regard to traditional herbal medicinal products.Secondly, there are laws by Member State parliaments, and lower level decrees and decisions by Member State ministries. In Finland for example, the Food Act is very similar to the European General Food Regulation. The EU principles such as the precautionary principle are transferred into Member State laws with little room for discretion. The European and national laws may be defi ned as 'hard law', as they have their base in EU Treaties and Member State constitutions. Hard law is enforceable by European and Member State courts. If rules are not followed, the functional food product can be taken off the market or have its marketing claim prohibited. Also civil liability and criminal sanctions might follow.So-called 'soft law' is important in connection with foodstuffs and medicines. With foodstuffs, one must follow guidelines by the European Commission, the EFSA, and national food authorities. Concerning novel foods, the Commission Recommendation includes detailed requirements of the application procedure. On health claims, the EFSA has produced 1425 Pere 2005, 85. We will not go further into analysing the direct effect of WTO law to private persons. See Pere 2005 on European case law thereof.1426 Hu 2000, 104.1427 Jie 2008, 108.-257-guidelines for example on how to draft applications1428. Of national soft law, the Finnish guides on health claims and food supplements by the Finnish Food Safety Agency might be relevant for our purposes. With medicines, the \"Notice to Applicants\" by the Commission and scientifi c guidelines by the EMEA are important sources of law.Legally, guidelines are not binding. However, if an applicant chooses not to follow a guideline, this decision must be explained and justifi ed in the dossier. The courts might give administrative soft law the weight similar to hard law norms. The problem of reliability of soft law is relevant also to a lawyer's responsibility towards his client. Normally, a lawyer cannot be sued for negligence if he bases his advice on soft law. If the soft law cannot ultimately be enforced, the client cannot sue the maker of the soft law, either. This is because the producer of soft law can revert to the fact that soft law is non-binding guidance only.Scholars of legal theory have listed attributes of soft law that add weight to it. The evaluation depends on:how the regulation is created (quasi-democracy, stakeholder involvement), -formal recognition of the regulation (referral to soft law in hard law), -degree of utilisation of the regulation (the more used, the more binding), and -moral acceptability (the more compatible with current values, the more binding). - 1429Based on these criteria, typical European soft law (such as EFSA and EMEA advice on how to draft applications) can be regarded as fairly binding.To keep up the good reputation of the industry, and to be respectable among other industry players, one should also have a look at self-regulation guidelines. There are guidelines by the European food industry association (CIAA) and the European Health Product Manufacturers.One could also decide not to follow the rules. All EU Member States foresee fi nes and/or imprisonment as criminal penalties for the sale of unsafe products, for example unhygienic foods or counterfeit medicines. Also misleading advertising, for example presenting fake health claims, is a crime. In civil proceedings, damages may be imposed on consumers, business partners, and sometimes also to competitors.6.3.3 ChinaIn China, the food and medicine law consists of certain basic laws given by the National People's Congress or the State Council, and several supplementing pieces of regulation given by the Ministry of Health or the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA). Compared to the European system, Chinese laws are more fragmented, each law covering one aspect of the foodstuff and medicine business. These separate pieces of regulation must be read together.If we decide to sell our berry products as foodstuffs, the general Food Safety Law and particularly the Health Food Regulation are most relevant to us. The original Health Food Regulation of 1996 has been supplemented by over 20 Notifi cations by the Ministry of Health 1428 See EFSA pre-submission health claim guidance for applicants 2007, and EFSA scientifi c and technical health claim guidance for applicants 2007.1429 Koulu 2009, 132.-258-and the State Food and Drug Administration. These govern good manufacturing practice, the application procedure, labelling, and advertising of health foods. In the future, health food regulations will be consolidated in a single piece of law.The Chinese Regulation on Novel Foods will possibly be relevant if we use a raw material that has not traditionally been used in China. The new Novel Food Regulation came into force in December 2007, replacing the original regulation dating from 1991. However, health foods and novel foods are separate legal categories in China, and novel foods cannot bear health claims. As we probably want to market our functional foods as health-enhancing, we will have to register them as health foods. In this case, both the safety and effi cacy of the product will be examined in the health food procedure, and the novel food procedure does not apply.If we decide to sell berry products as traditional medicines, the rules of the general Medicine Administration Law apply. New legislation particularly on traditional medicines is impending. It will include precise rules on safety and effi cacy of traditional medicines.Besides national rules, there are also local rules by cities and provinces. In Hong Kong for example, foodstuffs and medicines are mainly regulated together in Part V (Food and Drugs) of the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance (Cap. 132)1430. Sometimes local rules contradict with national rules in hygiene issues, for example. In this case, it might be advisable to abide by the stricter rules.6.4 Foodstuffs or Medicines?Based on the evidence above, we assume the three berries (or their fragments) to have a scientifi c base for use in health-enhancing products in EU and China. These products would be aimed at fi ghting the metabolic syndrome. First, we must consider whether these products would legally be treated as foods or medicines. In chapter 3, we have discussed the European and Chinese rules on categorisation.6.4.1 EU6.4.1.1 The Choice between the Two CategoriesIn EU law, there is no defi nition or category for functional foods. The categories of foodstuffs and medicines have traditionally been distinct. Whether the product is a food or a medicine is an important question as there are two different sets of law: one for foods and another for medicines. The most important difference between foodstuffs and medicines is that a risk/benefi t ratio is applied to medicines: safety and effi cacy are assessed simultaneously and side effects are only allowed if the benefi ts exceed the risks.For foods, the safety requirement is more absolute. Foods must not provoke any health hazards. The notion of food side effects would not be acceptable to consumers. There is one important exception to this: allergens in foods are allowed, and allergens can even be added to foods as additives. This means foods are basically safe for people without allergies. A further 1430 The Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Food and Environmental Hygiene Department web page at: http://www.fehd.gov.hk/safefood/foodlaw1.html.-259-limit to absolute safety is that various harmful chemicals and contaminants are allowed in foods, as long as their amounts do not exceed the set maximum limits, see chapter 4. With regards to marketing claims, medicinal claims are prohibited from foods, but disease risk reduction claims are allowed if substantiated.Businesses and consumers normally see functional foods as foods, not medicines This can be derived from the term itself: the producers and marketers call their products functional foods. Consumers don't normally see functional foods as medicines, either. Functional foods are not taken to treat some acute condition; they are instead consumed to gain a future benefi t. As opposed to foods, medicines are consumed to gain an immediate effect.In EU law, the separation of foodstuffs and medicines is derived from their defi nitions. A functional food could be regarded as a medicinal product based on either its functions or its presentation. The defi nition of medicines says: products are medicines if they:function as medicines and/or A) are presented as medicines.B) According to the defi nition of food, those that are medicines are not foods. A product cannot be both. An important clarifi cation was recently added to the defi nition of medicines: unclear cases are regarded as medicines. Classifi cation as medicine is legally possible for functional foods, because the previously mentioned defi nition of medicinal products does not exclude food-form products. A functional food could thus, according to EU law through pre-market authorisation or registration, receive the status of a medicinal product.Basically, the marketer must himself know and decide whether the product belongs under food law or medicine law. The form of the product does not determine classifi cation. The decision is based on product composition, the known effects of the product ingredients in human body, and the presented therapeutic use. When making the decision on which legal category to pursue, the benefi ts and costs of each option need to be weighed:Firstly, the pre-market procedures are separate for foodstuffs and medicines. The possible novel food and health claim procedures for foods are demanding, but still not as burdensome as the herbal medicine authorisation procedure. The new registration procedure for traditional herbal medicines is available to some products.Secondly, available claims differ between foodstuffs and medicines. For foodstuffs, health claims are allowed, but medicinal claims prohibited. A food cannot have medicinal functions or medicinal claims. Even if the product has signifi cant health effects, we might be willing to settle for food status. This is because the consumer impact of a disease risk reduction claim might be almost as strong as that of a medicinal claim.Thirdly, we must keep in mind that for medicinal products, there are limitations on available marketing channels1431. These marketing channels for herbals vary in different EU Member States. In Finland, around half of the authorised herbals authorised according to the old law can be sold in food stores, and the other half can only be sold in pharmacies. None of these herbals require prescription.1432 According to the new legislation, herbal medicinal products 1431 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.laakelaitos.fi /laaketeollisuus/luokittelu/luokittelun_jalkeen/index.html1432 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.laakelaitos.fi /uploads/Laaketeollisuus/Rohdokset/Rohdosluettelo_2006_2_28.pdf.-260-can only be sold in pharmacies, but traditional herbal medicinal products can also be sold in food stores.Even if we consciously decided to go with the medicine option, it might not be viable in practice. It might prove to be diffi cult or impossible to get a medicinal product license for something that looks, tastes, and feels like food. This is because the authorities seem to want to keep medicines and foods separate, regardless of their legal defi nitions. For example, the Finnish practice is \"margarine cannot be medicine\".We must also remember that the categorisation decision does not include authorisation. If a product is classifi ed as a medicine, this decision does not entail that the product will be authorised as a medicine. It merely means that without appropriate pre-market procedures, the product is illegal. If the product is categorised as food, this decision does not amount to an approval that the product may legally be sold under food law. It merely means that the product must comply with food law requirements.6.4.1.2 Grounds for the Classifi cation DecisionAt times we are unsure whether the functions of our product are medicinal. This typically means that our product contains healthy or medicinal ingredients but we still want to sell it as a food, for the aforesaid reasons. In this case, we either need to ask for a classifi cation decision before we market the product, or just sell the product as food and wait for the authorities to possibly react.Ultimately, national authorities resolve whether a product is a food or a medicine. This enables every EU Member State to divide functional foods into foodstuffs and medicines based on their own criteria. For example, according to Finnish law1433, the National Agency of Medicines will, if needed, decide whether a substance or a preparation is to be regarded as a medicinal product. In unclear cases it is \"recommended\" that the producer apply for a classifi cation decision.1434Categorisation in Finland is based on the pharmacopoeia drafted according to the Medicines Act1435. The pharmacopoeia is a list of substances regarded as medicines, and it includes quality requirements for each medicinal substance. According to the Decision on the Pharmacopoeia, substances in Annex 1 of the Decision are medicines. Herbals in annex 2 and vitamins and minerals exceeding the daily dose in Annex 3 can be regarded as medicines1436. Also other substances and herbals equivalent to substances and herbals in Annexes 1 and 2 and corresponding to the defi nition of medicines can be regarded as medicines. 1437 Basically, a product will be classifi ed as a medicine, if it contains functional ingredients in quantities that possess a pharmacological effect. The defi nition of 'pharmacological' does not exist in law.1433 Section 6 of the Medicinal Products Act.1434 Food supplement guide, updated 2006. Page 19.1435 Section 83 of the Medicines Act states that the National Agency of Medicines must every third year, of more often if necessary, regulate on a pharmacopoeia (laakeluettelo, list of medicines) that takes into account the defi nition of medicinal product etc.1436 A new pharmacopoeia (1179/2006) came into force in the beginning of 2007. Compared to the previous pharmacopoeia given three years earlier, no new herbs were added to Annex 2.1437 National Agency for medicines web page at: http://www.laakelaitos.fi /laaketeollisuus/luokittelu/luokittelun_perusteet/index.html.-261-If medicines, our functional berry products would be regarded as herbal medicines. An herbal medicinal product is a medicinal product exclusively containing as active ingredients one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations. Herbal substances are, among others, either dried or fresh plant parts. Herbal preparations are herbal substances subjected to treatments such as extraction, distillation, expression, fractionation, purifi cation, concentration or fermentation. Herbal preparations include comminuted or powdered herbal substances, tinctures, extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and processed exudates. This means subjecting our berries to a technological procedure will not change their legal category. Dried or fresh berries would legally be herbal substances, and fractions and oils would legally be herbal preparations.However, plant parts and plant extracts can of course also be used as foods. What resolves the issue of foodstuff vs. medicine is whether the product is either presented as a medicine or functions as a medicine. It is fairly easy to avoid our product being classifi ed as a medicine by presentation. We simply must not mention that it will cure, treat or prevent a disease. For example, we cannot use claims like \"for heart disease\" or \"to prevent diabetes\".The medicinal function is more complicated. The new European defi nition of medicinal product addresses the issue of what kind of functions are to be considered medicinal functions. Substances which \"may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action\" are medicinal products. It is also stated in the directive that any unclear borderline cases are to be treated as medicines, not foods. This new rule will also affect our situation: if we want to avoid our products being classifi ed as medicines, we need to be certain that our products do not constitute unclear cases but are clearly foods.What makes the categorisation decision more diffi cult is that the same plant raw material can be used in products categorised as foodstuffs and other products that will be categorised as medicines. Garlic is an example of a plant that can be used both as a food and as a drug. Garlic products are marketed in the European Union both as foodstuffs and as herbal medicinal products. All EU countries have garlic foodstuffs on their markets, and garlic medicinal products are available in some EU Member States.1438 Likewise, the Finnish Food Agency has interpreted that a commonly known medicinal plant Echinacea purpurea can also be sold as food. In this case, the use of the medicinal plant must be based on something else than the medicinal effect of the substance or herb. It is clear that there may be two products on the market that contain the same substances or herbs but to which different rules apply. It is unclear what these, other than medicinal uses might be, in the case of Echinacea.Because of different traditions in different EU countries, a product can be classifi ed as a medicinal product in one EU Member State and as a foodstuff in another."
