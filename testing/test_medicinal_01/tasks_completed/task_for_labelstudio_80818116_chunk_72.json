They grow natively in Macedonia form-ing pure and mixed stands in subalpine forests (Kalucka et al., 2013). The common used parts of the plant are root, stem, bark, branch, resin, tar, leaf, pollen, cone, seed, nee-dles (Kizilarslan and Sevg, 2013). They are used as antisep-tics, tonics, expectorants, analgesics, and especially in the treatment of respiratory (common cold, asthma, bronchitis) and urinary system disorders, skin diseases (wounds) and digestive system diseases. The bark and resin obtained from the Pinus trees are the primarily used parts of the plant, mainly because of the antimicrobial and antiseptic proper-ties. Additionally, diverse benefits have been claimed for pine needles as well, such as antibacterial, cholesterol low-ering, antioxidant and antitumorial effects.In this research, needles and bark of selected Pinus species were tested for their toxicological bioactivity, as a starting point for the selection of promising toxic agents that could be further investigated in more detailed studies of cytotoxicity.Materials and methodsNeedles and bark of Pinus peuce, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus nigra and Pinus mugo were collected at five different localities in the Republic of Macedonia: Pelister, Kozhuf, Karadzica, Berovo, Nidze. The plant material was harvest-ed in the year of 2008, 2009 and 2010. The collected plant materials weredried at room temperature for two weeks, and then milled to fine powder. A stock solution from each sample was prepared as a methanol extract, followed by lyophilization and freeze drying. The final extracts were prepared by reconstitution of the lyophilized powders with DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide). The toxicity of each plant extract was tested using the Brine Shrimp Lethality As-say (BSLA) (Meyer et al., 1982). The toxic potential was determined by counting the number of dead Artemiasali-nanauplii after 24 hours exposure to the tested plant ex-tracts. Furthermore, based on the calculated percentage of mortality of the brine shrimps, LC50 values were calculated using probit regression analysis (Finney, 1952). According to the obtained LC50values, the tested plant samples were classified using two scales of toxicity: Meyer's scale and Clarkson's scale (Clarkson et al., 2004; Meyer et al., 1982). Results and discussionThe obtained LC50values represent the toxic poten-tial of eachPinus species selected for toxicity testing in this research. According to the obtained data, every sam-ple of needles was classified as toxic according to Mey-er's scale and Clarkson's scale of toxicity. Pinuspeuce nee-dles collected from the locality of Pelister have the lowest LC50 value (LC5083 mg/mL). According to this result, it is classified as a sample with high toxic potential (0-100 mg/mL) using the Clarkson's scale of toxicity. The toxic bioac-tivityof the needles declines in the following order: Pinus peuce (Pelister)>Pinus mugo (Karadzica)>Pinus sylvestris S3 PP 145310Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 309 - 310 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentations(Kozhuf)>Pinus nigra (Kozhuf). Among the tested samples of bark, the highest tox-ic potential was detected for Pinus peuce collected from Nidze(LC50135 mg/mL) and was classified as a sam-ple with medium toxic potential (100-500 mg/mL) using Clarkson's scale.The results vary among the samplesand an important factor appears to be the locality of their ori-gin: the samples of bark collected from the locality of Ni-dze (Pinus peuce and Pinus sylvestris) manifested great-er toxicity compared to the same species collected from the localities of Berovo and Pelister. The toxic bioactivi-ty of the tested bark samples declines in the following or-der: Pinus peuce (Nidze) >Pinus sylvestris (Nidze) >Pinus sylvestris (Berovo) >Pinus peuce (Pelister) >Pinus nigra (Berovo).However, the prominent toxicity detected for the test-ed samples is probably a result of certain bioactive com-pounds with toxic characteristics that are naturally found in the selected Pinus species, since the samples were col-lected from localities which are characterized with a clean and healthy environment for plant growth. According to literature data, a-pinene is the dominant compound in most Pinus species. Additionally, this compound is a confirmed toxic agent (Leite et al., 2009), which suggests the origin of the toxic potential for the tested plant samples in this re-search.ConclusionAll tested Pinus needles and bark were classified as samples with a toxic potential according toMeyer's scale and Clarkson's scale. Moreover, Clarkson's scale classi-fied the examined samples in subcategories, according to which most of the tested extracts were samples with me-dium toxic potential. This gives a future perspective for further analysis of their cytotoxic potential and determi-nation of the components responsible for the toxic effects they manifest. Although BSLA cannot determine the com-pounds responsible for a toxic effect, it is still a useful tool for the selection of potential cytotoxic candidates based on the extent of toxicity they manifest against Artemia sali-na nauplii.

The organophosphates (OPs) or their active metabolites are electrophilic compounds with moderate to high potency for phosphorylating the serine hydroxyl group located in the active site of AChE. The reactivity of OP compounds varies depending upon the chemical struc-ture. OPs may also interact (inhibit) with other serine es-terases: neurotoxic esterase (NTE), butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), carboxylesterases (CarbE), phosphorylphospha-tases (A-esterases), fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), arylformamidase (AFMID), acylpeptide hydrolase (APH) (Casida and Quistad, 2004). Materials and methodsIn order to explore cholinergic and non-cholinergic targets of OPs, literature review was undertaken. Results and discussionThe half-life of recovery of inhibited brain AChE is about 1 week (approximately 5% per day) in experimen-tal animals and is believed to be the same in man. BuChE activity takes approximately 4-6 weeks to return to pre-exposure levels whereas erythrocyte AChE requires 5-7 weeks. BuChE is generally more sensitive than AChE to OP esters. Some OPs (tri-o-cresyl phosphate, mipafox, lep-tophos) considered to be extremely potent to inhibit NTE producing organophosphate-induced delayed polyneurop-athy that is associated with inhibition of at least 70% of the activity sometimes followed by irreversible transformation to its non-reactivatable form.The endocannabinoid arachidonyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and the endogenous sleep-inducing agent oleamide are hydrolyzed by FAAH. Anandamide also binds to the CB1 receptor in brain that is the target for marijuana and its principal psychoactive ingredient D9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Particularly potent inhibitors of FAAH in vivo in mice are chlorpyrifos and tribufos. The OPs may create a nicotinic acid deficiency by blocking its biosynthetic pathway. Tryptophan is the met-abolic precursor for N-formyl-L-kynurenine, L-kynuren-ine, nicotinic acid, NAD(H), and NADP(H) in mammals. AFMID (formerly known as kynurenine formamidase), the second enzyme in this pathway, is very sensitive in birds and mammals especially to OPs with nitrogen-containing hetero cyclic or aliphatic leaving groups (diazinon, diazox-on, monocrotophos). APH hydrolyses the N-terminal acetylated amino acid residue on peptides, thereby removing one form of pro-tection from proteolysis. It also hydrolyses oxidized pro-teins in human erythrocytes with a possible physiological function of removing oxidatively damaged components in cells. APH activity has been potently inhibited by chlorpy-rifosmethyl oxon, dichlorvos and diisopropyl fluorophos-phates with resultant IC50 values of 18.3, 118.7 and 22.5 nM, respectively. Malathion and malaoxon inhibit lysyl oxidase (LyO) (IC50 = 1-9 nM) as well as proline hydrox-ylase (IC50= 50-58 nM) in homogenates of Xenopus em-bryos, suggesting that they alter posttranslational modifi-cation of collagen with resultant morphological defects in S3 PP 146312Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 311 - 312 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsconnective tissue.Additionally, OPs may have a direct action on musca-rinic and nicotinic receptors, binding to (with high/low af-finity) and modulating the function of these receptors (as indicated by clinical effects). Specific binding of an OP compound to muscarinic receptors does not necessarily produce predictable effect (some OPs bind to muscarinic receptors and activate them, while others may bind to and inhibit the action of muscarinic receptors). OPs may bind to allosteric sites on nicotinic receptors stimulating recep-tor desensitization. The OP concentrations required to act directly on nicotinic receptors are much higher than those on muscarinic receptors, suggested that muscarinic recep-tors are more important as secondary targets in OP action. Cannabinoid system is also sensitive to OPs and their me-tabolites. Chlorpyrifos oxon is a potent in vitro inhibitor of cannabinoid CB1 receptor binding (IC50 = 14 nM) but is ef-fective in vivo only at near lethal levels. Combination of possible interactions will produce resultant toxic effect(s) for the certain OP. The spectrum of effects is modulated by various toxicokinetic factors. Exposure to OPs can induce four different clinical syn-dromes: 1. acute cholinergic crisis as a result of AChE inhi-bition (in CNS and PNS), 2. intermediate syndrome whose underlying mechanism(s) is still unclear(excessive stim-ulation of cholinergic receptors etc. ), 3. organophosphate induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) that has been ex-plained by the inhibition of NTE, and 4. chronic organo-phosphate induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND) due to long-term low-level exposure (LTLL) (Antonijevic and Stojiljkovic, 2007). Chronic exposure to OP substanc-es is a controversial area of toxicology: a number of au-thors propose that prolonged exposure at low levels of or-ganophosphates can produce adverse effects in man and in animals, while others have reported no such effects. Sever-al studies have reported long-term, persistent, chronic neu-rotoxicity symptoms in individuals as a result of acute ex-posure to high doses that cause acute cholinergic toxici-ty, or from long-term low-level, subclinical doses of these chemicals with or without previous history of acute epi-sode."
