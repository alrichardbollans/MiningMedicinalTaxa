      "text": "Some herbal products are now prohibited or have restricted use in the UK due to the safety concerns associated with them. The MHRA document 'Banned and restricted herbal ingredients' updated in December 2014, lists all the products which are subject to restrictions in the UK. It includes completely restricted products such as aristolochia, Kava-kava, and aconite (Aconitum species) traditionally used for poison arrows. Other products which can only be prescribed by a registered doctor or dentist include: foxglove (Digitalis purpurea L.) and opium (Papaver somniferum L.). Some products can only be purchased from a registered pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist such as, Mistletoe berry (Viscum album L.) and Belladonna (Atropa belladonna L.) (MHRA, 2014d). Before 126 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra concerns of the risks, adverse effects, and fatalities were recognised some of these products were widely available; but, over time as more reports documented the risks associated with them, they were withdrawn from the market. All drugs which have a marketing authorisation have to undergo extensive research to validate the risks and benefits of treatment; whereas, HMs may be consumed without any clinical research to support their use. The fact that HMs have been used for hundreds of years does not suggest they are safe (Barnes et al., 1998). Herbal products known to cause adverse effects or which may be harmful can be avoided; however, this information may not always be known and the long term implications remain to be uncovered. The risks of herb-drug interactions can affect the efficacy of conventional medicines which may threaten the pharmaceutical care of patients (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). Participants in this survey also made reference to the fact that HMs were harmful as their patients were more reluctant to take CWM if they were taking HMs, making health problems worse and more difficult to manage once they had exacerbated. There were several concerns raised over the safety of HMs; nevertheless, with better information sharing between patients and their HCPs, reporting of ADRs, and more research on HMs the safety profiles for herbal products can be better understood. Question 12: Would you ever recommend herbal medicines to your patients? Various reasons for not recommending HMs to patients were identified by 65% (n=62) of participants, including: participant 51 (an independent public health specialist) who said he would not recommend HMs, \"Because of the antipathy and overabundance of perceived problems related to herbal remedies by the medical profession,\" participant 56 (a dietician) who claimed there was, \"Not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines and potential interactions with Western medicines,\" and participant 69 (a doctor) who stated, \"It all depends on the evidence base! Great damage is done when people take alternative medicine instead of medicine proven to work.\" The Mintel Report (2009) claims that doctors and pharmacists may be uncomfortable referring patients to herbalism due to the lack of regulation, this was also observed within this research sample whereby HCPs said that the lack of regulation was one of the main reasons for not recommending HMs. This is further supported by the findings of the DTB survey of HMs which found that 84% (n=138) of HCPs surveyed did not think HMs were well regulated (DTB, 2010). 127 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Some of the other reasons participants in this study refused to recommend HMs to patients included: Participant 16 (clinical pharmacist), \"Difficult to quantify, as each case would vary in view of co-morbidities and individuals.\" Participant 22 (medicines information pharmacist), \"As a healthcare professional recommendations on treatment should be evidence based...evidence for efficacy and safety of herbal remedies is lacking, therefore I would not recommend herbal remedies.\" Participant 32 (senior pharmacist), \"There are not enough large comparable clinical trials into herbal medicines to warrant advising patients to use them instead of Western medicines. There is insufficient data for mixing herbal medicines and Western medicines, much of the advice provided to my patients if they state they want to use herbs as well as Western medicine is based on limited data and theory.\" Participant 77 (GP), \"I work on evidence based medicine principles and therefore unless trial evidence available I could not in good faith recommend them.\" Participant 84 (pharmacist), \"I do not recommend herbal remedies due to concerns over interactions with conventional medication. I think they could play a role in prevention/treatment of health conditions but there is variable quality between preparations which again means I do not feel I can recommend them. I do not see the harm in someone not taking a conventional medication trying herbal remedies.\" According to the GPhC standards of conduct, ethics, and performance, pharmacist are not allowed to recommend any remedy where they have any reason to doubt the safety or quality (Rees et al., 2014). In addition, pharmacists should only offer advice on HMs if they have had suitable training or knowledge. Some participants who said they would not recommend HMs went on to say they would recommend HMs if they had better knowledge of HMs; like participant 11 (a pharmacist) who claimed, \"I would recommend herbal remedies to patients if my knowledge on it was sufficient. As I do not know much about it and how it works to treat different conditions, I cannot really recommend it.\" Similarly to the findings of this research, Koh et al. (2003) found that many pharmacists like doctors did not believe they had the basic knowledge about HMs to be able to recommend them safely. Other participants who said they would recommend HMs if there was more evidence to support their use such as participant 69 (a doctor) who said, \"Herbal remedies are fine, but I will only prescribe them when I have evidence that they work better than conventional therapy and that they are safe to use within the context of the pharmaceutical regimens the 128 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra patient is already on.\" Furthermore, participant 106 (a pharmacist) claimed, \"The biggest problem with traditional herbal remedies is lack of information. The most common query I get regarding herbal products is \"Is this safe with my other medication?\" While there are very good books around (e.g. Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions) and advice (e.g. from the NPA) the books are rarely available in the average pharmacy and a phone enquiry cannot always give the immediate response that a customer may want. As a result it is frequently necessary to err on the side of caution and say that I cannot recommend it as I do not have sufficient information on the product.\" Just 35% (n=34) of participants said they would recommend HMs to their patients. The types of herbal remedies participants said they would recommend are summarised in Table 3-7. The most common herbal remedies participants said they would recommend included turmeric for various ailments such as cough, sore throat, skin conditions, and wound healing. Honey and lemon for coughs and colds, and evening primrose oil for low mood. Some of the reasons participants said they would recommend HMs to their patients included: Participant 12 (pharmacist), \"The use of herbal medicines is safe if used in context of other co-administered drugs and with full knowledge of the effects of the herb.\" Participant 20 (clinical pharmacist/ senior lecturer), \"Alongside allopathic medicines provided the patient consults the pharmacist - I think the patients' faith in day to day traditional herbs and spices also helps them psychologically.\" Participant 27 (optometrist student), \"Because it will most probably be preservative free meaning less adverse reactions from patients. Most likely to have less side effects. More positive effects then negative even if used long term. Herbal medicines are sustainable.\" Participant 70 (pharmacist/ researcher), \"If they are effective and safe, why not?\" Participant 88 (pharmacist), \"Because it is safer, effective and with less side effect than conventional medicine.\" 129 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 3-7 Herbal Remedies Healthcare Professionals Would Recommend To Their Patients Participant Number: Herbal Remedies Healthcare Professionals Would Recommend: 2 Turmeric for digestive complaints. Rhodiola for energy. Saw Palmetto for Libido. 3 Using ginger in tea or in foods to help with sickness. Green tea to help with digestion and due to anti- oxidant properties. 6 Tea bags for dry eyes. 18 Peppermint products for IBS. 21 Turmeric as it works for me! 23 For minor ailments such as cough and cold: honey and liquorice, honey and lemon. For Indigestion: fennel seeds, mint, aniseed. 26 Aloe vera creams, neem soap-is effective for patients who have skin conditions such as eczema. 46 Very simple remedies which I have tried and tested, mainly those involving turmeric and honey as previously stated. 47 For examples garlic against infections. 49 Yam for arthritis. 63 Passion flower for stress. Agnus castus for PMS/ cycle regulation. Saw palmetto for prostate (BP) related lower urinary tract symptoms. 64 For mood - St. John's wort or evening primrose oil. 68 Black cohosh. Evening primrose oil Saw palmetto. 73 Of course most elements and biological substances have active ingredients and while all are bad for you in excess- even water - many have been synthesised, including the first manufactured drug aspirin (from salicylic acid, originally from tree bark). In fact when herbal remedies are proved in scientific trials to have beneficial effect they are absorbed in mainstream medicine. What is left is usually of minor or no value, based on placebo effect and encouraging pseudoscience. 74 Honey and lemon is much better than cough syrups. 81 Peppermint for digestive issues. 82 Echinacea proven remedy anything that I have the evidence for. 91 Typically, for constipation- figs, prunes and pears. Natural constipation relief with the added benefit of all other associated nutrients. 103 Prevention as part of balanced diet. 108 I've recommended using cider vinegar to help with arthritis as I've seen that it helped my mum. 130 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Howard et al. (2001) found that in their survey of 70 pharmacists, 53% claimed to use dietary supplements themselves, they later went on to conclude that personal use correlated to an increased likelihood of making a recommendation to a patient. This can also be seen from the results of this investigation; participants who used HMs were generally more inclined to recommend them to their patients (Figure 3-8). Newall et al. (1996) say that HCPs need to be aware of the suitability of herbal remedies, even if HCPs do not use HMs themselves or believe they are effective they should still have some awareness about HMs as their patients may be using them. Heuschkel et al. (2002) found that one of the reasons respondents in their survey, about the use of CAM in patients with IBD, said they would use complementary therapies was if they were recommended by a doctor. The results from this survey suggest that some HCPs would recommend HMs, while others may have their reservations. Generally, the reasons for not recommending HMs were due to concerns of potential interactions with CWM, reduced compliance with prescribed medication, lack of evidence to support the use of HMs (i.e. limited safety and efficacy data), and HCPs personal lack of knowledge of HMs. Participants who were happy to recommend HMs had positive attitudes towards HMs, and often had tried HMs themselves. If there was better evidence to support the use of HMs and HCPs were more competent many said they would recommend HMs to their patients. 010203040506070No YesParticipants Personally Use Herbal RemediesNumber of ParticipantsPersonal Use of Herbal Remedies and Recommendations To Patients Wouldrecommend HMsWould notrecommend HMsFigure 3-8 Correlation of Healthcare Professionals' Personal Use of Herbal Remedies to Recommending Herbal Remedies to Patients 131 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 13: Did you receive any information about herbal medicines during your professional training? As the literature available on how much information is passed on to undergraduate HCPs was limited this question was designed to try and establish whether or not HCPs in the UK had received any training on HMs. Over a third of participants (35%, n= 34) said they did receive some information on HMs while undertaking their professional training. This was exemplified by participant 33 (a senior lecturer in law, ethics and pharmacy practice) who said, \"When I trained (in the 1970's) there was a large amount of pharmacognosy taught and that did cover materials of plant origin but not herbal remedies specifically.\" However, a large number of participants (65%, n=62) said they did not receive any information about HMs during their training. HCPs are at the frontline of patient care so need to be competent in giving advice and treating patients appropriately especially if they may be taking HMs. If HCPs are not adequately trained it could affect patient care, increase the risk of interactions with CWM, and adverse effects may go undetected. Question 14: Do you think enough training is provided to you about herbal medicines? The results from this question revealed that the vast majority of participants (74%, n=71) said they did not think enough information was provided to them on HMs. Participant 67 (a professor emeritus of surgery and medical humanities) stated, \"Our students should be taught that there are no metaphysical difference in biological activity between herbal and pharmaceuticals.\" Koh et al. (2003) conducted over 400 surveys on pharmacists in Singapore to find out about their use, knowledge and attitudes towards CAM; they found that 90.5% (n=380) felt not enough information on CAM was provided during their training. Although regulatory bodies such as the GMC and GPhC do require undergraduate students to be informed about CAM, they do not specify the content. As the brief is often so broad (i.e. the GPhC standards for education states 'complementary therapies') this leaves schools open to decide what they think is suitable to meet the requirements (GPhC, 2011). Research by Smith (2011) found that in some medical schools, in the UK, a single lecture was deemed sufficient. It may be useful for regulatory bodies to clarify the extent to which CAM should be taught to students (Smith, 2011) to better prepare future HCPs to deal with patients taking HMs. 132 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Some participants in this study (26%, n=25) said they thought enough training was provided; for example, participant 85 (a pharmacist) who stated, \"I know about herbal medicines as I studied pharmacognosy during my bachelor's degree in India\"; however, this participant did her pharmacy degree in India where training on HMs is commonly included in the curriculum. Furthermore, Participant 61 (a GP) who said he did not receive any information on THM while training, nor did he think enough training was provided then went on to say, \"It's difficult to see how further training in a totally different method of medicine, using preparations with significantly varying concentrations of active ingredients and unregulated or tested by MHRA could be fitted in to an already overloaded curriculum.\" The comments made by participant 61 suggest that the intensive training programmes HCPs endure are already straining; similar responses were also seen by Smith (2011). When Smith (2011) contacted UK medical schools to investigate the extent of inclusion of CAM education in undergraduate courses it was revealed that schools felt there was a lack of interest from staff and students in CAM, limited funding, and most importantly the programmes were already congested. Newall et al. (1996) claims that, \"a pharmacist should be able to advise the consumer on the rational and safe use of all medicines; thus, a pharmacist should be fully informed about the quality, safety, and efficacy of herbal medicines.\" However, if this vital information is not transmitted to HCPs while they are training it would be difficult for them to gain this knowledge. Research conducted by the DTB (2010) explored how well informed HCPs felt that doctors were about HMs; 75.5% felt doctors were 'poorly informed' about HMs, while only 21.5% felt that doctors were 'well informed'. As the popularity of HMs increases, more high quality research to support the use of HMs is required. Vickers (2000) claims that research on CAM is being conducted worldwide reflecting the growing awareness of the use of HMs. This will enable HCPs to be educated about HMs with reliable evidence based guidelines, an issue which was raised by many participants in this investigation. Regulatory bodies should make requirements for CAM education clearer so HCPs are equipped with the knowledge to deal with HMs queries competently. Educating future HCPs and providing continual professional development (CPD) programmes to encompass HMs will help HCPs make better informed decisions about HMs. 133 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 15: Any other comments: The final question gave participants the opportunity to share any comments and feedback. Table 3-8 summarises the remarks made by participants. Most of the comments were generally about the structure and content of the survey. Some participants, such as participant 22, were very engaged with the questionnaire and had several points they wanted to highlight. There were concerns that just participants who used or had knowledge about HMs would complete the survey giving biased results; however, the comments suggest participants with a range of opinions completed the survey, not just people who are in favour of HMs. Table 3-8 General Comments from Healthcare Professionals Participant Number: General Comments: 2 Very nice survey, number 10 - it depends what health conditions.... 12 In line with question 12, more information is needed rather than an outright rejection by healthcare practitioners. 16 All the best with the project! 22 Your survey does not give the opportunity to say that I am happy for patient's to take alternative remedies as long as they are safe, of good quality and do not interact with other drugs. I am aware of the beneficial effects (may be placebo) of the patient being empowered by being in control of their own therapy. Taking alternative remedies should not stop a patient reporting the condition/side effect that they are treating to their clinician. Very little information is available on South Asian alternative remedies. Have great concerns about quality of products available. 30 Use of herbal medicines is common amongst people living with HIV. This might be an area to investigate in the future. 43 Difficult to answer some questions which are closed questions and therefore black and white. 49 Would love to hear more. 50 Lot of potential. Needs research. 64 I am in mental health and do not prescribe so limited experience of patients' prescription medicines for things other than depression and pain. 66 What matters is not what people think, but what the evidence says."
