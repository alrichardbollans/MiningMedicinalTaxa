      "text": "Bailey (1994) suggested the gender of the researcher may affect participants' willingness to take part in research, saying SA male participants may not be as responsive to a female researcher. As there were fewer opportunities to approach male participants it is difficult to say whether or not the gender of the researcher affected the recruitment process. There was a mixture of participants from the different age groups defined; as illustrated in Figure 2-4 which summarises the participants' age and gender profiles. A larger number of participants (n=59) were in the 61 years plus age range; this could be explained by the locations selected to target SA participants (i.e. day centres, community centres, and religious institutes) which were predominately used by older SA cohorts. In order to explore the younger generations' knowledge and use of traditional HMs places where younger SA 32 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra participants congregated were also identified; for example, the De Montfort University campus and library. There is much debate on how to classify age groups as young, middle aged, and elderly (WHO, 2010). For the purpose of this study those under 30 years will be referred to as young participants, middle age will include 31 to 60 year olds, and those over 61 years will be classed as older or elderly participants as identified by the Department of Health (2001). Participants' Ethnicity The 2011 Census results confirm the largest SA ethnic group in the UK are the Indians, followed by Pakistanis and a significantly smaller number of Bangladeshis (Office for National Statistics, 2012); this was also evident in this research sample (Figure 2-5). There were 73% Indian, 19% Pakistani, and 3% Bangladeshi participants. Questionnaires were distributed in areas where a variety of South Asians (SAs) could be found (e.g. SA community centres and the university campus). It should be noted that there was a large number of participants who would describe their ethnicity as Indian even though their families now reside in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In addition, several participants wanted to add the option of Asian British; however, it was explained to participants that their place of birth would be where they can express their nationality; but ethnicity was to determine their racial ancestry (Prabhat, 2010). Prabhat (2010) defines a person's ethnicity as being linked to their traditional and cultural heritage, language, rituals, behavioural and religious characteristics. 73%19%3%5%Participants' EthnicityIndianPakistaniBangladeshiOtherFigure 2-5 SATMED Participants' Ethnicity 0510152025303540455020 or under 21-30 years 31-40 years 41-50 years 51-60 years 61 years +Number of participantsAge rangeAge and Gender Profile of ParticipantsMaleFemaleFigure 2-4 SATMED Participants' Age and Gender 33 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Participants' Place of Birth Figure 2-6 represents the birth place of participants and their parents; it highlights that 44% (n=84) of participants were born in the UK, 27% (n=52) in India, 17% (n=33) in Africa (Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania), 10% (n=20) in Pakistan, and 2% (n=3) in other countries which included France, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The majority of participants born in the UK were in the young age group (n=73); while those born in India (n=46), Africa (n=29), and Pakistan (n=15) were predominately in the middle age or older age group. More than half of the participants' parents (55%, n=107) were born in India; despite this many of these participants families are now settled in Pakistan and Bangladesh but they still call themselves Indian as their parents were born in India before the partitioning into independent states (Healy and Aslam, 1989; Brown, 2006). This information can be used to determine whether participants are first or second generation citizens in the UK. The term first generation could refer to citizens born in a country or those who were born in a foreign country and moved to take residence in another (Moffett, 2015). For the purpose of this analysis, first generation immigrants will be used to describe those participants born in a foreign country but now living in the UK. From the total sample population 108 participants can be identified as being first generation immigrants as they were born outside of the UK. Nine participants stated both parents were born in the UK, making these participants first generation citizens or natives to the country of birth. Second generation refers to people who are born in the country of relocation (i.e. the UK) with one or both parents born abroad (Moffett, 2015). There were 75 participants who were second generation citizens as they were born in the UK, but one or both parents were born elsewhere. Many of the participants' parents were born in South Asia and may be responsible for transmitting valuable knowledge of THM to future generations. 020406080100120UnitedKingdomIndia Africa Pakistan OtherNumber of participantsPlace of BirthParticipants and their Parents Birth Place ParticipantMotherFatherFigure 2-6 SATMED Participants' and Their Parents' Place of Birth 34 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Participants' First Language Spoken The primary language spoken by 50% (n=97) of participants was English (Figure 2-7). Followed by a quarter of participants who said their first language was Punjabi; this included people from India and Pakistan as prior to the partitioning of India, Punjabi was the main language spoken in the North. In the UK, Punjabi is the third most popular language spoken, followed by Urdu, Bengali, and then Gujarati (Office for National Statistics, 2012). In this study, Gujarati was the third most common primary language spoken and often these participants did not speak any other language. Other first languages spoken included Mirpuri and Tamil. Participants were also asked if they spoke other languages too. Many of those who spoke English as a first language also spoke Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, and Gujarati. Other languages participants were fluent in included: Swahili, French, German, and Dutch. Participants' Religion There were a fairly even number of participants from the three main SA religions: Hinduism (34%, n=64), Sikhism (26%, n=50), and Islam (36%, n=70) (Healy and Aslam, 1989). There was a small fraction of participants who said they were Christian and their parents were originally from South India; this is where Christianity is most common in India. The option of 'No Religion' was only selected by 2% (n=4) of participants (Figure 2-8). Some religions have a strong affiliation with herbal medicines (HMs); for example the Tulsi plant represents a goddess in Hinduism (Miller and Miller, 2003). By determining participants' religion the link between religion and transfer of knowledge of HMs can be explored. 50%25%15%4%3% 3%Participants' First LanguageEnglishPunjabiGujaratiUrduHindiOtherFigure 2-7 SATMED Participants' First Language 34%26%36%2% 2%Participants' ReligionHinduSikhMuslimChristianNo ReligionFigure 2-8 SATMED Participants' Religion 35 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Participants' Qualifications Figure 2-9 represents the highest levels of qualifications attained by participants organised according to the various age groups. The majority of participants who selected 'no qualification' were first generation immigrants (n=50) and in the 61 years plus age range (n=42). Many participants who had some qualifications from India or Pakistan were considered to be equivalent to UK GCSEs; hence, a number of participants (n=10) in the 51-60 and 61+ age group had GCSEs. A-levels were the highest qualification attained for the majority of participants in the 20 or under and 21-30 years age range (n=69); 93% (n=64) of participants doing A-levels were currently enrolled on an undergraduate degree programme (e.g. pharmacy, nursing, psychology, business information technology, or accounting). Apprenticeships were more common amongst the middle aged population (n=14). Hanif and Karamat (2009) highlighted that many of the first SA immigrants had little or no qualifications; this is also evident from the results of this survey. On the other hand, some first generation immigrants with degrees may have come to the UK in search of professional job opportunities. Most of the degrees obtained by SA participants were professional degrees. Masters and PhD qualifications were also attained by a small proportion of participants. Participants' Occupational Status Participants' occupations were summarised into the following categories: student, employed, unemployed, retired, or housewife. Students formed 38% (n=73) of the research population, followed by 27% (n=52) of participants who had retired. The employed population which comprised 24% (n=46) of participants worked in professional roles such as healthcare (doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and carers), finance (accounts) construction (surveyors), management (company directors and managers), and law (solicitors).

When middle aged SA women were asked about their occupation 11 participants (6%) said their job role was a \"housewife\". As this is not a paid occupation it was not included in the employed section instead it was given its own category. Summary of the Research Participants The research sample was composed of a diverse range of SA participants. There were more female than male participants from a variety of age groups, ethnic origins, religions, and cultural groups. Although the questionnaires were conducted around several locations in Birmingham and Leicester, participants living across the UK took part in this questionnaire (Figure 2-10); this was because the temples where the research was conducted had devotees from around the country coming to worship. In addition, the students at DMU were also from different parts of the UK. Participants from all over Birmingham, Coventry, Derby, Dudley, Leicester, Liverpool, London (i.e. Croydon, Hounslow, Ilford, Slough, Southall, Surrey, and Wembley), Loughborough, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Nottingham, Rotherham, Walsall, and Wolverhampton took part in this research (Figure 2-10). Due to the number of participants living across the UK it means the results can be generalised to SAs in the UK, rather than just SA communities in the two cities where the questionnaires were conducted.

If YES, what do you use and why? The words herbs, plants, and spices were used to prompt participants to think about the different types of HMs they used. Two thirds of participants (66%, n=126) said they did use HMs to supplement their health and to treat various conditions. There was a vast range of HMs participants listed, including: ajwain (carom seeds) for digestion, ginger for nausea and coughs, aloe vera for eczema, cardamom as a mouth freshener or to aid digestion, mint for indigestion, fennel for coughs and constipation, and cloves for toothache. The numerous uses of turmeric recorded by participants included its use in treating coughs and colds, wound healing, as an antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and its immune boosting properties. Honey and lemon was not only used for coughs and sore throats but also as a face mask to remove pimples and lighten the skin. Several products to control diabetes were identified such as curry leaf, fenugreek, karela, and tulsi. HMs to help reduce blood pressure (e.g. garlic) and cholesterol (e.g. cinnamon) were noted. Other conditions which participants claimed to treat with HMs included: healthy hair growth by using egg and yoghurt or henna, blocked sinuses opened with menthol or eucalyptus oil, and tea tree oil for spots and scars. Pieroni et al. (2010) highlight that very little is known about the use of homemade herbal medicines amongst migrant populations. The results of this question uncover that SA migrant communities in the UK commonly use a diverse range of HMs. The herbal products identified by participants have been summarised in Appendix 5. The 34% of participants (n=66) who said they did not use any herbal remedies were asked to move on to question 6 as the following questions were about participants' personal use of HMs. For the following questions 2-5, the results are only for the 126 people who said they did use herbal remedies in question 1. Question 2: Where do you get the ingredients for your herbal remedies from? This question was asked to explore how ingredients for HMs were sourced, and to determine whether or not ingredients for HMs could be bought in the UK. This question allowed for multiple responses as often people get their ingredients from a variety of different places. Figure 2-11 illustrates the different ways participants obtained the ingredients for their HMs. From the analysis of the results, 21 participants said they got the Family/ FriendsGrow your ownAyurvedic clinicLocal supermarketAbroadOnlineOtherIngredients for Herbal Remedies Obtained FromFigure 2-11 Where Ingredients for Herbal Remedies Were Sourced 38 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra ingredients from their 'family/friends'. Participants mentioned family members grew some products so shared them, or parents and grandparents gave HMs if ever unwell as reasons for getting products from family and friends. Tulsi, ajwain, aloe vera, curry plant, mint, and coriander were identified as plants commonly grown by participants (n=23). A small number of participants (n=4) revealed they visited Ayurvedic practitioners and clinics for HMs. Three of the participants who selected the 'other' option, disclosed that they got their HMs from 'Baba Ramdev' they did not class this as an Ayurvedic clinic/ practitioner as there was a strong religious affiliation. Ramdev studied Sanskrit and yoga before he began teaching others; he became famous when his yoga sessions were aired on Indian television channels across the world. He established the Divya Yog Mandir which was supported by a pharmaceutical company (Divya Pharmacy), which formulated and sold Ramdev's HMs, all based on traditional Ayurvedic remedies (Divya Yog Mandir, 2015). These HMs are manufactured in India and sold around the world; evidently they are available in the UK with Ramdev centres open across the UK and several participants claimed to be using them. The remaining six participants who selected the 'other' option said they got their HMS from: the pharmacy (n=2), Holland and Barrett, The Body Shop, and Forever Aloe Vera representatives. Participants (n=27) also stated they got their ingredients from 'abroad' this included countries such as Africa, India, and Pakistan. Raw ingredients including ajwain, shilajeet, neem, tulsi, and turmeric; as well as commercial products such as chyawanprash, churan, and amrat dhara were commonly imported from India and Pakistan. Participant 67 said, ''when my family comes from Pakistan or Saudi Arabia they bring us some neem leaves,'' while participant 108 stated, ''I buy my herbs fresh in India, let them dry and grind them, then bring them back to the UK.'' Despite the widespread availability of turmeric in the UK, several respondents mentioned that their families back in India and Pakistan grew their own turmeric; which they believed was better quality and more effective as highlighted by participant 162, ''you can tell in the colour and taste of the turmeric it is much better from Pakistan.'' Pieroni et al. (2010) also found participants in their study imported ingredients for HMs from abroad if they were not available in the UK; but, mentioned that many ingredients were now available in Bangladeshi shops or larger supermarkets. The most common place to get ingredients for HMs, selected by 101 participants, was local supermarkets. To explore the availability of ingredients in the UK participants were asked to specify whether they got their products from Asian supermarkets, Western chain supermarkets (e.g. Asda, Tesco or other Western shops) or both. Figure 2-12 exemplifies that a similar number of participants said they got their ingredients from either Asian shops only (n=35) or both Asian and chain supermarkets (n=36). 39 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Just over half of respondents (51%, n=18) who specified 'Asian shops only' were over 61 years old. Specific Asian shops where the ingredients were bought from were mentioned for example in South Birmingham 'Metha' and in Leicester the 'Kelani' store. There could be a variety of reasons why older participants preferred only to visit Asian shops; for instance, they know the stores which stock the ingredients they want, and are able to communicate with people better in their own language. Language barriers could be a key factor in explaining why elderly SAs prefer to shop in Asian supermarkets. The Census 2011 highlights that the majority of the 2.4% of the population of Birmingham who cannot speak English are from a SA background (Birmingham City Council, 2013). Other participants from the various age groups who claimed to only get their ingredients from Asian supermarkets said they were familiar with the shops and trusted the quality of the products, and commented on the price of the products; participant 131 said, ''I prefer the Asian shops because they are cheaper.''"
