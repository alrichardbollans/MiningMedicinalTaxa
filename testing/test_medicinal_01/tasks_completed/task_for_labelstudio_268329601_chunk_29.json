WILD EDIBLES If you drop into almost any bookstore and look in thenatural history section, you are likely to find a recentlypublished book on the identification and preparationof wild edible plants. There is a tremendous interest inthis subject, particularly on the part of impoverishedstudents and others fascinated by a return to a moresimple way of living.We might begin with a simple question. What is anedible plant? The answer is not as easy as you mightthink. Consider our personal preferences in cultivatededible plants. Are we all in agreement that okra,eggplant, and hominy grits are edible? To many of usthey are comparable to slime, cardboard, andwallpaper paste. About all we can do is talk aboutplants that most of us consider edible, realizing thereare many others that we might add to the list.SOME PRECAUTIONSBe sure of the identification of any plant that you eat.It is not only important to avoid poisonous plants, butto know the identity of the plant that you are about toconsume.Make certain that you know the toxic plants of yourarea. Excellent technical and popular references areavailable to assist you in telling the edible from thepoisonous. It can be difficult. The edible plants of thecarrot family are amazingly similar to ones that arelethal. The toxic plants of the lily family closelyresemble some of the popular wild edible ones. Peoplemake these mistakes all the time; some only once!Eat plants that are growing in uncontaminated areas.Avoid plants growing in stagnant waters, thosegrowing in the immediate vicinity of agricultural areasthat might have been sprayed, or those growing insoils high in nitrates or selenium.In some plants, only certain parts are edible, while inothers the entire plant body may be eaten withimpunity.Also, some plants may be eaten without anypreparation, while others require cooking, sometimesinvolving a change of waters. Consult the recipes fordetails.Never eat large quantities of any wild plant that youhave not tried before. Place a small portion in yourmouth, chew it up, and then spit it out. Wait for a fewminutes to see if any unpleasant taste or stingingsensation occurs. If not, chew and swallow a smallpiece of the plant. This time, wait for an hour or so. Ifthe plant passes your personal test, then proceed withsome of the fancy recipes.You should also ignore much of the folklore associatedwith wild edible plants. One of the most dangerousmyths is that you can use other animals' food habitsas a guide. After all, if a bird can eat that plant or ifyou see Bambi browsing on some herb, then it mustbe safe to eat. The digestive system of birds, othermammals, and insects are sufficiently different fromours that they should not be viewed as reliable guides. The notion that plants come color-coded (certaincolors indicate edibility; others toxicity) is also withoutfoundation. Also be leery of the stories about tellingmushrooms from toadstools by the latter's ability todiscolor silver spoons or coins.SOME WILD EDIBLE PLANTS OF CALIFORNIACommon Name Scientific name CommentsUNDERGROUND PLANT PARTSamole Chlorogalum pomeridianum Bulbs, slightly acid unless cookedarrowhead Sagittaria latifolia Tuberous roots;
