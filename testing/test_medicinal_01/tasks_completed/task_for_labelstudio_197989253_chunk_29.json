This means medicinal plants can be used as food. They will not be classifi ed as medicines requiring a product licence just because they contain a medicinal substance. The same plant can be used as nutrition for healthy people and as medicine for sick people. 4.2.2.3 Biological and Chemical Safety Issues In China, besides the former Food Hygiene Law or the current Food Safety Law, there are a number of lower level decrees on particular biological safety issues on different types of products. These are, for example, separate regulations giving specifi c hygiene rules on food irradiation, meat and meat products, milk and milk products, eggs and egg products, aquatic products, condiments, sugar, alcohol, grain, edible vegetable oil, tea, edible mushrooms, street food, student food etc.819.Chinese food safety efforts at the farm level are primarily concerned with chemical residues in spite of the fact that food poisonings and deaths from microbial contamination exceed those from farm chemical exposure. China is developing good agricultural practice guidelines, ChinaGAPs, which will address minimising the risk of microbial contamination.820The Ministry of Agriculture is the lead agency promoting food safety at farm level. The ministry has created standards intended to guarantee that foods are free of contaminants. The \"pollution-free programme\" and the \"green food programme\" have standards specifying tolerances for harmful materials in soil, water, and air.821 They also regulate the use of fertilisers and pesticides, and set maximum residue levels. The programs include certifi ed production areas and trademarked symbols for use on consumer products. Packaged products carry information on the fi rm, which is a step towards a traceability system. Compliance is enforced by regular testing of soil, water, and air, and random testing of fi nal products for residues.822The above-mentioned programs are voluntary, and not yet commonly followed. In 2005, about 6 percent of the volume of agricultural production met the pollution free standard, and 1 percent the green standard, which is stricter.823 The decision to produce green or pollution-free food is usually made by local offi cials or agribusiness enterprises, not the individual farmers824. The trend is inevitably towards green food, though. This is because exports require 819 Kan - Zhang 2002.820 Calvin et al. 2006, 20-21.821 More specifi cally, the green food program defi nes two categories of green food. AA green food is equal to organic food, and A green food is between normal food and organic food. A green food is more realistic in China, as Chinese land is already heavily polluted. GMOs can be used in A but not AA green food.822 Calvin et al. 2006, 20. 823 Calvin et al. 2006, 20.824 Calvin et al. 2006, 21.-147-adherence to rather strict rules, and also because Chinese consumers are becoming more aware and cautious. Bian sees green food as a suitable compromise between organic food and normal food, particularly for developing countries. Following the green food standard does not make food too expensive, but use of fertilisers and pesticides is still heavily restricted.Besides regulations on contaminants and residues, chemical safety is the goal of regulations on food additives825 and food contact materials826. In Chinese law, \"food additive\" refers to any synthetic compound or natural substance put into food to improve its quality, colour, fragrance or taste, or for the sake of preservation or processing. \"Nutrition fortifi er\" refers to any natural or artifi cial food additive belonging to the category of natural nutrients that is put into food to increase its nutritive value.827According to Article 11 of the Food Hygiene Law, the production, marketing and use of food additives must conform to the hygiene standards for use of food additives and the hygiene control regulations. Food additives that do not conform to the hygiene standards and the hygiene control regulations may not be marketed and used. Specifi c standards on additives are given by the 2002 \"Administrative Provisions for Food Additive Hygiene\"828.In 2005, Chinese government organisations announced that food additives constitute the greatest threat to food safety in China. To address this problem, authorities promised to increase the number of quality specifi cations of food additives in line with global standards. In 2005, less than a quarter of all state quality specifi cations for food additives can be compared with international standards. The government promised to increase this ratio to at least a half by 2007.829Food contact materials were regulated by Articles 12 and 13 of the Food Hygiene Law: \"Containers, packaging, utensils and equipment used for food must conform to the hygiene standards and the hygiene control regulations. The raw materials for making containers, packaging, utensils and equipment used for food must meet hygiene requirements. The fi nished products should be easy to clean and disinfect. According to AP-Foodtechnology.com, the new Food Safety Law has alerady boosted food packaging business in China. The law has created demand for \"coated materials with barriers designed to keep bacteria out and freshness in the package\"830.4.2.2.4 Safety of Health Foods: Raw Materials Functional foods, fortifi ed foods, and vitamin and mineral supplements are in China regulated as health foods. Health foods are foods which have a specifi c health function, are suitable for a certain group of people, and which are not for therapeutic purposes. Requirements on health food safety and effi cacy are here discussed separately, even though these two aspects are in China evaluated in a single procedure. Health food effi cacy and claims are discussed in chapter 825 In 2002, 431 varieties of food additives and 1040 varieties of spices had been approved by the Ministry of Health.

China News. 830 News article at ap-foodtechnology.com, by Rory Harringon 20 October 2009.-148-5. Procedural rules on health foods (concerning the pre-market authorisation procedure) were discussed above in chapter 2. The legal basis for Chinese health food regulations was formerly in Articles 22 and 23 of the Chinese Food Hygiene Law. In Article 22 of the Chinese Food Hygiene Law, it refers to specifi c rules on health foods: \"With regard to food indicated to have specifi c health functions, the product and its description must be submitted to the administrative department of public health under the State Council for examination and approval. Hygiene standards and control measures for the production and marketing of the product are then formulated by the authority.\" According to Article 23 of the Food Hygiene Law, the food claiming to have specifi c health functions may not be harmful for human health. The content of the product manual shall be accurate and truthful while the functions and ingredients of the product shall be identical with the marketing claims.831 The new Food Safety Law states the same rules on health foods in its Article 51. It is fi rst stated, \"the state executes strict regulations on health foods\". Health foods may not pose acute, sub-acute or chronic hazard to the human body. Labels and instructions may not refer to disease treatment or prevention, all information and claims must be truthful, and the product must comply with the information. The Health Food Regulation of 1996832 and its subsequent amendments give more precise rules on health foods. The Health Food Regulation was enacted to strengthen the administration and supervision of health foods, ensuring the quality of health foods according to the Food Hygiene Law833. The regulations focus on evaluation and approval of health foods, and are as such directed more at authorities than at entrepreneurs. However, there are also sections regulating production and marketing of health foods.The regulations establish minimum safety and effi cacy requirements for health foods as follows:raw materials and fi nal products must comply with food hygiene requirements and shall -not cause any acute, sub chronic, or chronic harm to human body,necessary animal and/or human tests must have confi rmed a clear and stable health effect, -formulation and dosage must be based on scientifi c evidence (the functional ingredient -should be identifi ed but when that is impossible, at least the raw materials that cause the effect shall be listed),therapeutic effects shall not be claimed in labelling or advertising. - 834In addition to general hygiene rules, safety of health foods is controlled via controlling the choice of raw materials. A separate Notifi cation from 2002835 governs the raw materials of health foods. First of all, the Notifi cation aims to clear the situation of overlapping pieces of legislation. Novel foods are considered a separate issue from health foods. If a health food has novel ingredients, the Novel Food Regulation shall be followed. Further, if the health 831 Article 23 of the Chinese Food Hygiene Law.832 Ministry of Health: Administrative Regulations on Health Food, Order No. 46 (Promulgation Date: 1996-03-15; Effective Date: 1996-06-01. )833 Article 1.834 Health Food Regulation, Article 4. Huang - Lapsley 2005, 266.835 Ministry of Health: Notifi cation on Further Standardising the Management of Raw Materials for Health Food (Directive, Document No. :WeiFaJian[2002]51, Promulgation Date: 2002-02-28.-149-food uses food additives, additive law applies. Additionally, there are particular rules on fungal health foods836, probiotic health foods837, and nuclei acid type of health foods838. These products should follow these procedures respectively.839If health foods involve protected wild animals or plants, they should be applied according to Notifi cation of Restraining the Produce of Health Food using Wild Animal and Plants as Raw Materials of Ministry of Public Health of the Notifi cation of 5th July 2001 restraining the use of certain single materials840 that have anti-desert function in the wild.841 Other health food raw materials are regulated by three lists given by the Annexes of the Health Food Raw Material Regulation: List I includes materials that can be used either as foods or medicines. -List II includes materials that can be used as health food materials. -List III includes materials that are prohibited as health food materials. -The more complicated rules are given by point 5 of the Raw Material Notifi cation: First of all, if health foods involve products (or materials) of animals or plants, the -number of products (or materials) of animals or plants can not exceed 14.If health foods use products (or materials) that are not listed in the List of Materials -which are used as either Foods or Medicines, the number of products or materials of animals or plants cannot exceed 4.836 Regulation on Evaluation and Examination of Fungal Health Foods, valid from March 23rd 2001. Fungal health food means food with specifi c health function, which uses edible macro-fungi and carpophores and fi laments or fi lament macro-fungi. Fungal health food must be safe and dependable, i.e. safe for eating, non-toxic and not harmful. The strains used in production must have clear and stable characteristics of biology, genetics and functionality. Article 3. Only certain fungus species are permitted as health food ingredients. The permitted fungus species are the following: Saccharomyces cerevisae, Candida atilis, Kluyveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, Paecilomyces hepiali Chen et Dai, sp. Nov, Hirsutella hepiali Chen et Shen, Ganoderma lucidum, Ganoderma sinensis, Ganoderma tsugae, Monacus anka, Monacus purpures. Huang - Lapsley 2005, 266. If an entrepreneur wants a fungus to be added on the list, an application to the SFDA has to be made.837 Regulation on Evaluation and Examination of Probiotic Health Foods, valid from March 23rd 2001. Probiotic health food means preparation which promotes ecological balance of bacterial colony in the intestine and is benefi cial to human health. Article 2. The probiotic strains must belong to one of the normal bacterial colonies in human body. It is allowed to use live or dead bacteria and bacterial metabolites. The probiotic health food must be safe and dependable, i.e. safe for eating with no adverse reactions. The strains used in production must have clear and stable characteristics of biology, genetics and functionality. Only certain probiotic bacteria are allowed as health food raw materials. The permitted probiotics are the following: Bifi dobacterium bifi dum, Bifi dobacterium infantis, Bifi dobacterium longum, Bifi dobacterium breve, Bifi dobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus bulgarius, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobasillus casei subsp. Casei, Streptococcus thermophilus. Huang - Lapsley 2005, 266. If an entrepreneur wants a probiotic to be added on the list, an application to the SFDA has to be made.838 This means health foods using DNA or RNA as raw material. The purity of DNA or RNA must be above 80 percent, and the recommended dosage for nuclei health foods should be 0,6g-1,2g per day. Huang - Lapsley 2005, 266.839 Points 1, 2, and 3 of the Notifi cation.840 Wild liquorice, saussurea involucrate, xxx and xxx. There is no English word for the latter two.841 Point 4 of the Notifi cation.-150-If health foods use products (or materials) of animals or plants not listed in the List of -Materials, which are used as either Foods or Medicines and neither in List of Materials, which can be used in Health Foods, the number of products (or materials) of animals or plants can not exceed 1. This product (or material) of animal or plant should go through safety and toxicology evaluation according to the Novel Food Regulation. If you want to use a material outside both lists, you can only use one which cannot be on the third list of forbidden materials. If you wish to use materials on the fi rst and the second list or merely on the second list, you can use four materials altogether. If you can settle with the materials listed in the fi rst list, then you can have 14 materials. Normal food materials are not included in this number, only materials with health effects. Category I includes approximately 90 materials, for example Hawthorn fruit (Fructus Crataegi), Barbary wolfberry fruit (Fructus Lycii), Lotus leaf (Folium Nelumbilis), Lotus seed (Semen Nelumbilis), Hemp seed (Fructus Cannabis), Ginkgo seed (Semen Ginkgo), Oyster Shell (Concha Ostreae), Honey (Apis Melifera), Peppermint (Herba Menthae), Peach seed (Semen Persicae), and Tangerine peel (Citrus Reticulata).842Some of the products containing these materials will be classifi ed as traditional medicines. Whether a product is a health food or a traditional medicine will depend on functions and marketing claims of the product. See the separation of foodstuffs and medicines above in section 3.Category II includes approximately 110 materials, for example Ginseng root, leaf and fruit (Radix Ginseng, Folium Ginseng, Fructus Ginseng), Deer embryo (Fetus Cervi), Deer bone (Fel Cervi), White peony root (Radix Paeoniae alba), Red peony root (Radix Paeoniae rubra), Aloe vera (Herba aloe), Magnolia fl ower (Flos magnoliae), Tortoise shell (Carapax et Plastrum testudinis), and Ginkgo leaf (Folium Ginkgo).843Category III includes approximately 60 materials, for example Poppy capsule (Pericarpium Papaveris), Quicksilver (Mercury), Chinese azalea fl ower (Flos Rhododendri mollis), Lily of the valley grass (Herba Convallariae majalis), Mung bean blister beetle (Lytta Caraganae pallas), and Blowfi sh (Globefi sh, Tetraodontiforms syn. Plectognathi).844In addition to complying with the lists, the product must pass a toxicological safety assessment. There is a Ministry of Health standard845 establishing requirements for toxicological testing."
