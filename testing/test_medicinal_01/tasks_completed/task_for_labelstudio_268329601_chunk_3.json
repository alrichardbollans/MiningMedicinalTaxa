      "text": "These names also haveauthorities, as in Cannabis sativa L. ssp. indica(Lamarck) E. Small & Cronquist. If the subspecies orvarietal name is a repeat of the specific epithet, thenthe authority is not repeated, as in Zea mays L. ssp.mays.Since we are focusing our attention on plants ofeconomic importance, an additional explanation isneeded for the term variety. For reasons that areobvious, we have developed many different cultivatedstrains of a particular crop plant or ornamental. Thereare literally thousands of different kinds of rice. Thereare probably hundreds of different kinds of tuberousbegonias. In general parlance, we often call thesevarieties. However, for purposes of formalnomenclature, these variations are considered toominor and often too short-lived to warrant giving them-10-a scientific name. The variety of botanicalnomenclature is not used in these instances. Instead,we employ the term cultivar (cultivated variety). It isabbreviated cv. The \"Martha Washington\" geranium istechnically known as Pelargonium hortense cv. 'MarthaWashington. 'Many of our economic plants are hybrids that resultfrom the accidental or purposeful crossing of twoclosely related species or cultivars. This can bereflected in the scientific name of the hybrid byinserting an \"x.\" If the x occurs before the genericname, then the plant is considered the result of across between two plants in different genera, as in XTriticale, a hybrid between wheat (Triticum) and rye(Secale).If the x occurs between the generic name and thespecific epithet, then the plant is the product of across between two species in the same genus, as inthe banana, Musa x paradisiaca. It is result of a crossbetween Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana.WRITING SCIENTIFIC NAMESThere are a few simple rules that must be followed inwriting scientific names.' The genus is always capitalized.' The specific epithet should not be capitalized. Therules allow them to be if they are commemorative,as in Elymus Smithii (a relative, no doubt) or if theepithet was once a generic name itself, as in AcerNegundo, the box-elder. Even in such instances,however, the rules discourage capitalization.' The generic name and specific epithet areunderlined when they appear in handwritten ortyped material. They are put in italics or bold-facein printed text.' The authority is always capitalized, but it is notunderlined or otherwise set off from the remainderof the text.THE ORIGIN OF SCIENTIFIC NAMESMost of the words that make up scientific names arederived from Latin or Greek, although there is norequirement that they must be. Modern names andeven nonsensical ones have been used. Manystudents, however, believe that there must be somerequirement that scientific names be as long andunpronounceable as possible. This reveals a certainlack of scholarship. Even a rudimentary knowledge ofetymology is very helpful in understanding thecomposition of scientific names. The followingexamples may be helpful.Commemorative NamesBlighia William Bligh, Captain of the BountyCarnegia Andrew Carnegie, American industrialistnuttallii Thomas Nuttall, English botanistmenziesii Archibald Menzies, surgeon/naturalistClassical/aboriginal NamesAgrostis Greek name for grassFagus Latin name for the beech treemays Indian name for corn or maizecepa Latin name for the onionGeographical Namesanglicus of or pertaining to Englandgallicus of or pertaining to Francecanadensis of or pertaining to Canadasinensis of or pertaining to ChinaGrowth Formarboreus treerepens creepingscandens climbingHabitatarenarius growing in sandcampestris of the fieldsfluviatilis of the riverssativus cultivatedStructural featurePenstemon having 5 stamensSanguinaria having a red sapamabilis lovely in appearancefoetidus foul-smellingtuberosus having a swollen partUseesculentus edibleofficinalis recognized as medically importantsomniferum sleep inducingtextilis having useful fibersPRONUNCIATIONThe International Code of Botanical Nomenclaturestates that scientific names of plants are to be treatedas Latin words, regardless of their origin. A few of themore scholastically inclined botanists will argue,therefore, that we ought to pronounce scientificnames according to the strict rules of the sounds ofvowels and consonants in Latin and that great careshould be taken in accenting the proper syllable. But,there are several versions of Latin to choose from,each with its own set of rules for pronunciation.Most American botanists pronounce the scientificnames of plants as though they were English words.Some of us follow the rules in Latin for determiningwhich syllable is accented; most of us do not. Many ofus pronounce scientific names the way we were taughtas undergraduates (if any formal discussion occurred)or more commonly we imitate the way our professorssaid them when we took their classes. These becomethe familiar and \"correct\" way to pronounce thescientific names of plants.A Quick and Dirty Guide to Pronunciation' Pronounce each syllable.' Say them as you would in English.' Put the accent where you think it ought to be.' Try to be consistent.A More Scholarly Approach The following is an attempt to present a basic guideto pronouncing vowels, consonants, and diphthongs,together with some of the rules for accenting-11-syllables.' The letters of the Latin alphabet are the sameas ours, except that J, U, and W did not occurin the classical version.' Each syllable will contain a vowel or a doublevowel combination (ae, au, ei, oe, or ui). Thelatter are called diphthongs.' Pronounce all of the syllables. Ribes is \"ri-bees,\" not \"ribs.\"' Final vowels are long, with the exception of a.If a word ends in two vowels (unless they area diphthong), they are sounded separately.The epithet quinquefolia is pronounced \"kwin-kwe-fo-li-ah.\"' The diphthongs \"ae\" and \"oe\" have the sound\"e,\" as in the word beat; \"au\" has the sound of\"aw,\" as in awful; \"ei\" usually has the sound\"i,\" as in site; \"eu\" has the sound of \"u,\" as inneuter; and \"ui\" has the ui-sound in the wordruin.' The \"oi\" in the ending \"-oides\" is treated as adiphthong by most American botanists and wegive it the sound that \"oi\" has in the word oil. Thishabit is considered close to barbaric by Englishand Europeans who are much more persnicketyabout such matters. Because these two vowels donot form a diphthong, they should be pronouncedseparately, so that the ending \"-oides\" has thesound \"-o-e-deez.\"' A single consonant is placed with the followingvowel, as in \"pa-ter.\" Double consonants areseparated, as in \"am-mi.\" If there are two ormore consonants, the first one is usually put withthe preceding vowel, as in \"an-gli-cus.\"' The letters B, d, f, h, l, m, n, p, qu, and z arepronounced the same in Latin and English.' The consonants c and g are soft (that is, have thesounds of \"s\" and \"j\") if they are followed by ae,e, i, oe, or y. Otherwise, the c is pronounced likea \"k\" and the g is also hard, as in \"go.\" The s isalways pronounced as it is in the word \"so,\" notas a \"z.\" An initial x is pronounced as a \"z,\" not\"ek-z.\" Xanthium is \"zan-thi-um,\" not \"ek-zan-thi-um.\"' The first letter is silent in words beginning withcn, ct, gn, mn, pn, ps, pt, and tm.' Accenting the proper syllable can be tricky.Sometimes the author of a flora or other manualmay provide assistance by including an accentmark. Most do not. If included, they are for theconvenience of the reader and they are not part ofthe scientific name itself. If you must determinewhich syllable to accent, the following rules maybe helpful. Words of two syllables are alwaysaccented on the first syllable. In words of three ormore syllables, the last syllable is never accented.The stress will fall either on the next to the lastsyllable (the penultimate syllable), as in \"ar-ven-sis,\" or on the third from the last syllable(antepenultimate), as in \"an-gli-cus.\" No matterhow long the word, the accent can never be to theleft of the antepenultimate syllable. Decidingbetween these two options is a difficult choice.Accent the penultimate syllable if it ends in aconsonant, diphthong, or in a long vowel.' Commemorative names (patronyms) present aspecial problem because giving them the properaccenting can render the person's nameunrecognizable. The epithet jamesii is pronounced\"ja-me-se-i,\" not \"james-e-i.\" Most of us in theUnited States ignore this rule.THE CODE FOR CULTIVATED PLANTSThe naming of cultivated plants is governed by its ownset of rules, the International Code of Nomenclaturefor Cultivated Plants. The following articles arepertinent:Article 1. Cultivated plants are essential to civilization.It is important, therefore, that a precise, stable, andinternationally accepted system should be available fortheir naming.Article 7. Cultivated plants are named at three mainlevels: genus, species, and cultivar (variety).Article 10. The international term \"cultivar\" denotes anassemblage of cultivated plants which is clearlydistinguished by any characters (morphological,physiological, cytological, chemical, or others), andwhich, when reproduced (sexually or asexually),retains its distinguishing characteristics. The term isderived from cultivated variety. Note 2. The conceptof cultivar is essentially different from the concept ofbotanical variety, varietas. The latter... are always inLatin form and are governed by the Botanical Code.Note 4. The terms cultivar and variety (in the sense ofthe cultivated variety) are exact equivalents.Article 29. A cultivar name, when immediatelyfollowing a botanical or common name, must bedistinguished clearly from the latter, either by placingthe abbreviation cv. before the cultivar name, or bysome typographical device, preferably by enclosing itwithin single quotation marks. It should not be printedin italics.-12-1.4 ! CHRONICLE OFECONOMIC BOTANYThe purpose of this compilation is to identify the datesof various critical discoveries, events, voyages,inventions, publications, etc. that relate toeconomically important plants. I begin by setting thestage, so to speak, with cosmological considerations --the formation of the universe, solar system, and ourplanet. The next several entries relate to theappearance of life on the earth, beginning about 4billion years ago. The evolution of our immediateancestors began about 4 million years ago, with thefirst true human beings appearing in Africaapproximately 1.5 million years ago. Our use of plantsbegins at about that point, with such discoveries asfire-making, the building of shelters, and the cosmeticuse of dyes. About 150,000 years ago we beganincorporating flowers into ritual burials; there is someevidence that 60,000 years ago we started usingvarious herbs because of their medicinal properties.Farming of cultivated plants began about 16,000 yearsago; the domestication of various plants and animalsapproximately 10,000 years ago. Most of ourimportant crop plants were domesticated over thenext few thousand years. Only a handful of plantshave been domesticated in the last two millennia.In about A. D. 800, Irish voyagers reached Iceland,beginning an age of exploration that would last for athousand years. Among the many notableaccomplishments of Marco Polo, ChristopherColumbus, James Cook, and others was a dramaticincrease in our knowledge of the natural history of ourplanet and the exchange of plants and plant productsaround the globe. As the sixteenth century came to aclose, newly developed instruments and techniques inthe fields of botany and chemistry formed the basis ofour modern understanding of the plant kingdom. Thiswas followed by the appearance of a series ofinventions designed to extract various products fromplants and to process them.The nineteenth century saw the refinement ofchemical extraction procedures that allowed us toisolate and purify a number of economically importantmaterials, especially certain alkaloids with medicinaland psychoactive properties.In the twentieth century, we have witnessed thegrowth of giant industries based upon the supplying ofa long list of plant products to the consumer. It was alittle over a hundred years ago that the field ofgenetics was founded with the investigations ofStrasburger and von Beneden into the mechanisms ofmitosis and meiosis. For the last several decades, wehave developed the techniques needed to control thegenetic heritage of many of our most important cropsand to create entirely new ones in our laboratories.Our studies have also shown how dangerous plantproducts such as alcohol, tobacco, and the opiates canbe; how destructive to the natural environment ourconversion of land for the growing of crops can be;and how we have become increasingly dependentupon a relatively short list of genetically-impoverishedplants.DATE EVENT, DISCOVERY, ETC.Years Ago: 13,500,000,000 The \"Primordial Explosion\" or \"The Big Bang\"12,500,000,000 Galaxies form6,000,000,000 Sun forms 5,000,000,000 Solar system forms 4,500,000,000 Earth forms 4,000,000,000 Beginning of life on Earth (bluegreen algae) 1,600,000,000 Multicellular plant life evolves425,000,000 Terrestrial plant life evolves395,000,000 Insects evolve380,000,000 Ferns evolve350,000,000 Gymnosperms (cone-bearing plants) evolve216,000,000 Mammals evolve200,000,000 Continental drift begins123,000,000 Flowering plants evolve69,000,000 Primates evolve67,000,000 Extinction of the dinosaurs24,000,000 Grasses evolve14,000,000 Ramapithecus, oldest human-like primate, evolves in Africa and India11,000,000 Grazing animals evolve7,000,000 Sahelanthropus tchadensis (\"Toumai man\") oldest hominid species, evolves in Africa4,400,000 Ardipithecus ramidus evolves in Africa4,000,000 Australopithecus afarensis (\"Lucy\") evolves in Africa3,700,000 Modern horses evolve3,200,000 Large ice sheets build up over northern continents2,400,000 Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) begins2,400,000 Hominids in Africa make first stone tools2,000,000 Australopithecus boisei and A. robustus evolve1,900,000 Homo habilis (\"Handy Man\") evolves in Africa; first hand axes1,800,000 First stone dwellings (Tanzania)1,600,000 Apes and prehumans use red ochre as a cosmetic1,500,000 Homo erectus, first true human, emerges in Africa1,400,000 Discovery of fire (Kenya)1,000,000 Homo erectus migrates through the Old World tropics-13-800,000 Homo erectus populates temperate zones; makes shelters from branches420,000 First huts (France); first fishermen (France)200,000 Homo sapiens (\"Thinking Man\") evolves200,000 Artistic hand axes appear150,000 Neanderthal Man emerges in Paleolithic Europe; ritual burials there and in Far East127,000 Last glaciation and associated warming period79,000 Oil-burning lamps made of stone in use60,000 Earliest evidence of herbal medicine50,000 Humans first populate Australia45,000 Music and oral literature developed (Asia)35,000 Modern humans evolve in Europe35,000 Oldest written records35,000 Asian hunters cross Bering Strait35,000 Cro-Magnons appear; Neanderthals decline32,000 Flute, first known musical instrument, invented30,000 Human settlements in Mexico27,000 Cave art (France); ceramics and sculpture (Czechoslovakia)27,000 First humans colonize Japan21,000 Sewing needle invented18,000 Bow and arrow invented (Europe)18,000 Laurentide and Scandinavian ice sheets attain their greatest extent16,000 Mesolithic begins16,000 Farming of cultivated plants begins15,000 Ropes invented (France)13,000 Grinding stones for grain developed (Egypt)11,000 Pottery developed (Japan)11,000 Bottle gourd domesticated (Africa ? )10,000 Dog domesticated (Iraq/Palestine)10,000 World population reaches 3 millionB."
