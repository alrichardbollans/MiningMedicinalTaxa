The West African plant Thaumatococcusdaniellii, an herb in the prayer plant family(Marantaceae), contains a protein that is up to 4000times sweeter than sucrose. From that same region,a second plant called Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii,yields another protein that is 800-3000 times sweeterthan cane sugar. Stevia rebaudiana, a South Americanmember of the sunflower family, contains stevioside,a glycoside up to 300 times as sweet as sucrose. Alittle closer to home, Lippia dulcis, of the vervain orverbena family native to Mexico, has a compound inits leaves and flowers that is 1000 sweeter.-113-SECTION 7.0 ! BEVERAGE PLANTS7.1 ! AN OVERVIEW' There are three major groups of beverages thatwe derive from plants: fruit juices and those thatcontain caffeine or alcohol.' Many widely used beverage plants are relativelyunknown here in the United States.' The ethyl alcohol in beer, wine, and distilledbeverages is a byproduct (which sounds betterthan waste product) of microscopic yeasts.' Caffeine acts as a stimulant to the centralnervous system.' Alcohol is not so easily categorized. It can be adepressant or a stimulant, and has other effectsas well.' Both caffeine and alcohol fit comfortably withinthe usual definition of a drug.' The ill effects of alcohol abuse are well-established.' Linkage of caffeine consumption with heartdisease, high blood pressure, etc. remainscontroversial.7.2 ! CAFFEINATEDBEVERAGES\"It is probably significant that the most widespreadwords in the world - borrowed into virtually everylanguage - are the names of the four great caffeineplants: coffee, cacao, cola, and tea.\"(E. N. Andes, \"The Food of China\")' ' ' ' 'We have developed a number of non-alcoholicbeverages from plants. There is an almost endless listof fruit juices. They are, however, of rather minoreconomic importance when compared to the threeleading nonalcoholic drinks -- tea, coffee, andchocolate. These drinks contain alkaloids,physiologically active compounds containing nitrogen.If you examine a structural representation of theirmolecules, you will see that they have a ring of carbonatoms.CAFFEINE & RELATEDALKALOIDS The principal alkaloid in coffee, tea, and chocolate iscaffeine, technically known as 1, 3, 7-trimethyl-xanthine. It has been called the most widely usedpsychoactive material on earth. In the United States,we consume about one quarter of the world's supply,about 211 milligrams per person per day (about threetimes the world's average).Two other chemically similar alkaloids may also befound in caffeine-bearing plants. They aretheobromine and theophylline. Collectively they areoften called the xanthine alkaloids.CAFFEINE CONTENTWe encounter caffeine in various foods, beverages,medicines, and weight-control aids.

Caffeine acts by inhibitingadenosine, a naturally-occurring tranquilizer in thebrain. It appears to dislodge adenosine from receptorsites. A recent paper suggests that the effects of ourfirst cup of coffee in the morning are really those ofcompensating for the first stages of withdrawalsymptoms that began while we were asleep and notreplenishing the supply of caffeine to our centralnervous system.In large doses, caffeine can cause:' nausea' vomiting-114-' insomnia' restlessness' tinnitus (ringing in the ears)' tremors' scintillating scotoma (\"island of blindness\")' rapid heart action' irregular heart beat, and' diuresis.Tolerance and habituation may develop fromprolonged use. There is considerable debate as towhether caffeine is outright addictive and should beclassed as a drug.CAFFEINE-BEARING PLANTSPlant Source Part Usedcassine=Ilex vomitoria leaves and shootscocoa=Theobroma cacao seedscoffee, Arabian=Coffea arabica seedscoffee, Congo=Coffea canephora seedscoffee, Liberian=Coffea liberica seedscoffee, robusta=Coffea canephora seedsguarana=Paullinia cupana seedskhat (qat)=Catha edulis leaveskola (cola)=Cola nitida seedsmate (yerba mate)=Ilex paraguariensis leavestea (cha)=Camellia sinensis leaves and budsyaupon=Ilex vomitoria leaves and shootsyoco=Paullinia yoco barkTEA\"Tea is better than wine for it leadeth not tointoxication, neither does it cause a man to say foolishthings and repent thereof in his sober moments.

Cancer Inst. reports inhibitory effects ongrowth of tumorsTea or cha, from the leaves of Camellia sinensis, wasonce the most widely consumed caffeinated drink inthe world. Now it is second only to the cola beverages.The plant is native to Southeast Asia, perhaps China.Tea has had a long history. At first it was strictly amedicinal plant. It was not until about the 5th centuryA.D. that tea became popular in Asia as a drink. Itremained relatively unknown in Western Europe untilthe 16th or 17th century. Today China remains theleading producer; India and Ceylon the chiefexporters.The tea plant is a small tree that is usually keptpruned back as a shrub. It is often grown under theshade of some other plant on the hillsides of tropicaland subtropical areas. The leaves are produced influshes. After the third or fourth year, the flushes areplucked. This consists of removing a section of theyoung shoot bearing three or four young leaves andthe terminal bud. The plucking stimulates the lateralbuds to produce shoots. After about ten years, theplant is cut back to the ground and sucker shoots takeover. The harvesting is done by hand in mostinstances, although machinery is used in some areas.It is important not to bruise the young leaves.There was, by the way, a version known as \"ImperialPlucking.\" Tea for the Emperor of Japan was pluckedby virgin women who wore special gloves and usedscissors of gold to remove the bud and youngest leaf.They were placed on a golden platter to dry.PROCESSING OF BLACK TEAWitheringLRollingL-115-SortingLFermentationLDryingLSortingLGradingAfter the leaves have been removed from the plant,they are spread out on trays to wilt. Once again it isessential to prevent bruising so as to avoidfermentation. Temperature during the withering phasemust be precisely controlled. Once the leaves havewilted, they are rolled under pressure to separatethem from the stem tips and to crush them. Thecrushing helps to distribute the sap within the leaf.This also initiates fermentation. A preliminary sizing orsorting also occurs at this point. The partiallyfermented and sized leaves are placed on screen-bottom trays. During this fermentation phase thetemperature is kept between 21-25EC and the relativehumidity at about 90%. Many very important bio-chemical changes occur during the fermentationprocess. The tea leaves are then dried for 20-25minutes at 90-100EC. The final grading involvesjudging the aroma, uniformity, and appearance of theleaves along with the taste, color, and aroma of theinfusion made from the leaves.Green tea is processed much the same as black tea,except that the freshly plucked leaves are heated toinhibit fermentation. The oolong teas are partiallyfermented. Black tea is the most commonly producedtype.Because of local variation in quality, differences inquality over a period of time, and local tastepreferences, most of the commonly consumed teashave leaves from a wide variety of sources blendedtogether.Bubble tea or boba milk tea or tapioca milk tea is arecent fad imported from Taiwan. It is tea, milk,sugar, and black tapioca pearls, served cold.Tea leaves contain up to 5% caffeine or theine andabout 20% tannins. There are also dextrins, pectins,cellulose, and other structural materials. After a fiveminute infusion the tea leaf yields about half of thetannins, 3/4 of the caffeine, and about half of theother extractable solids.THE TEA CEREMONYThe Japanese tea ceremony, adapted from an earlierritual developed by the Chinese, is based on the Zenprinciple of adoration of the beautiful and the routine.The setting is a tea house in a garden or special roommade of specific materials and configuration. Typicallythere are hanging scrolls, flowers, and a sunkenfireplace. Participants enter along path of pavingstones, walk silently, and leave behind their worldlyconcerns. The host extends a silent greeting. A lightmeal is served. Water is heated over a charcoal stove.The host presents the tea utensils that will be used.Green tea (matcha) is now prepared. Everyone drinksfrom a communal bowl, usually taking three servings.The teapot, spoon, and other implements are washedand put away. The host now offers cake and a weakertea. This sets the stage for silent contemplation of thefire and the surroundings. The host now takes gueststo threshold of the tea house where there is a ritualrinsing of mouth and hands.COFFEE\"One need only compare the violent coffee-drinkingsocieties of the West to the peace-loving tea drinkerof the Orient to realize the pernicious and malignanteffect that bitter brew has upon the human soul. \"(Anonymous Hindu dietary tract)\"Coffee should be black as Hell, strong as death andsweet as love.\" (Turkish proverb)\"They have in Turkey a drink called coffee. This drinkcomforteth the brain and heart, and helpethdigestion.\" (Sir Francis Bacon)\"Coffee makes us severe, and grave, and philo-sophical.\" (Jonathan Swift, 1722)The \"...damned infidells [drink] a certaine liquor,which they do call Coffe.\" (Anthony Shirley, 1599)\"Everybody is using coffee. If possible, this must beprevented. My people must drink beer. \"(Frederick the Great, 1777)\"Wherever it has been introduced it has spelledrevolution. It has been the world's most radical drinkin that its function has always been to make peoplethink. And when the people began to think, theybecame dangerous to tyrants. \"(William Ukers, 1935)TIMELINE: COFFEE1000 Arabs prepare hot drink from boiled beans1400 Domesticated (Arabia)1511 Coffee houses in Mecca closed1573 Leonhard Rauwolf publishes directions forpreparation of Turkish coffee1601 \"Coffee\" appears in English for first time1616 Introduced into Europe1650 Oxford opens first coffee house1652 London opens first coffee house1658 Dutch grow in Ceylon1674 \"Women's Petition Against Coffee\"published1675 Charles II bans coffee houses in London1688 Edward Lloyd founds \"Lloyd's CoffeeHouse\"1689 Paris opens first coffee house1696 Dutch grow in Japan1696 New York opens first coffee house1714 Jardin des Plantes receives coffee tree fromDutch1727 Coffee trees planted in Brazil1732 J.

About 80% of all coffeeproduced comes from South America; half of it fromBrazil. Coffee is second only to tea in world popularity.In the U.S. it is a much more popular drink. About 75-90% of all coffee beans processed come from Coffeaarabica. This shrub is native to Ethiopia, not Arabia asthe epithet suggests. Much of the remainder is derivedfrom \"Robusta Coffee\" (C. canephora), which is usedprincipally to make instant coffee. Other speciesutilized are \"Liberian coffee\" (C. liberica) and \"Excelsacoffee\" (C. excelsa).Coffee beans were first used as a food, the seedsbeing eaten on long trips to ward off fatigue. It wasnot until the 15th century that coffee became popularas a drink.The coffee plant is a shrub or small tree. Like tea, it isoften grown in the shade of other plants. Trees beginto bear fruit after about three years. The fruits aregreen at first, and after about a nine monthmaturation period, they turn a bright red. At thisstage they are often called cherries. The fruit consistsof an outer skin (exocarp), a pulpy flesh (mesocarp),and a hard bony inner layer, the parchment(endocarp), which surrounds the seeds. The seed coatitself is called the silverskin. Processing of the coffeebean involves getting rid of these layers surroundingthe seeds.PROCESSINGThere are two methods of processing the cherries. Thesimplest is the dry method. The fruits are spread outin the sun to dry for 15-25 days. They are thendehulled. The more commonly employed wet methodinvolves several steps. The cherries are first pulped.This removes the outer skin and much of themucilaginous flesh. The seeds surrounded by theparchment and some adhering pulp are graded bytheir specific gravity into various size classes andplaced in fermentation tanks for 12-24 hours. Thefermentation removes any remaining pulp from theparchments. The coffee beans are then washedcarefully and dried. This drying stage is traditionallydone on a \"coffee drying floor.\""
