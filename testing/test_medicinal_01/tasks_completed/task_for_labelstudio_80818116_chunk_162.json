Aflatoxin - albumin adducts are found in peripheral blood after exposure to aflatoxin B1. Aflatoxin M1 and aflatoxin B1 - DNA adduct (aflatoxin B1 - gua-nine adduct) can be detected in the urine of people consum-ing sufficient amounts of aflatoxin B1. Increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase are a biochemical indicator for aflatoxins toxicity. Detection methods for aflatoxins in human body sam-ples are radioimmunoassay (RIA), enzyme - linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA), high - performance liquid chro-matographic fluorescence detection (HPLCf). Albumin samples are digested with proteinase K in a phosphate - buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 15 h at 37oC. Following hydrolysis, bovine serum albumin (BSA) is added to improve precipitation, followed by cold etha-nol addition. Samples are kept at -20oC for 2 h, centrifuged at 1500xg for 15 min and the supernatant is diluted with 6% ethanol in PBS. The samples are then loaded into an activated Sep - pak CIS cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA), washed with water, 5% methanol, and the aflatoxins are eluted with 80% methanol. Eluates are dried, reconstituted in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum (to saturate residu-al proteinase K activity), and tested with ELISA using afla-toxin - lysine standard (Wild et al., 1990). A study conducted in sub - Saharan Africa proved that chronic hepatomegaly is common among school - age children in sub - Saharan Africa. This study examined the S8 PP 314658Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 657 - 658 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsrole of aflatoxin in chronic hepatomegaly. Plasma sam-ples were collected in 2002 and 2004 from 218 children attending two schools in neighboring villages (Mantagini and Yumbuni). Plasma samples were assayed for aflatoxin exposure using the aflatoxin - albumin adduct biomarker (AF - alb). The blood AF - alb levels were determined us-ing ELISA. One negative and three positive controls were analyzed alongside each batch of samples. The limit de-tection for AF - alb was 3 pg/mg albumin. AF - alb levels were high in children from both schools, but the geometric mean value (95 % confidence interval) in 2002 was signif-icantly higher in Matangini (206.5 pg/mg albumin) than in Yumbuni (73.2 pg/mg). AF - alb levels were also higher in children with firm hepatomegaly (176.6 pg/mg) compared to the control group (79.9 pg/mg). In 2004, AF - alb lev-els were higher than in 2002 (539.7 vs. 114.5pg/mg), but with no significant difference between the villages or be-tween hepatomegaly and control groups (539.7 vs. 512.6 pg/mg). Exposure to aflatoxin was associated with child-hood chronic hepatomegaly in 2002 (Gong et al., 2012).Aflatoxin is known to cross the placental barrier and exposures in utero could influence genomic programming, fetal growth and development. In a study, pregnant Gam-bian women were examined for aflatoxin exposure at two stages of their pregnancy (early - < 16 weeks; and later - 16 weeks onward), during the rainy (June to October 2009) or dry (November to May 2010) season, using aflatoxin albumin adducts (AF - alb). Plasma samples were ana-lyzed for AF - alb using a competitive ELISA. One neg-ative and three positive controls were analyzed alongside each batch of samples. The limit of detection for AF -alb was 0.6 pg/mg albumin. Mean AF - alb was higher dur-ing the dry season than in the rainy season, in both early and later pregnancy, although the difference was strongest in later pregnancy. There was a modest increase in AF - alb in later compared to early pregnancy (geometric mean 41.8 vs. 34.5 pg/mg), but this was restricted to the dry sea-son when exposures were generally higher. The study con-firmed that Gambian pregnant women were exposed to af-latoxin throughout the pregnancy, with higher levels in the dry season. Overall, the stage of pregnancy was not signif-icantly associated with AF-alb but season was (Castelino et al., 2014).PreventionConsidering the danger of human contamination with aflatoxins, prevention is an imperative, as the safest and most economical protection method. The most promis-ing strategy currently being used to reduce contamination of crops with aflatoxin is to introduce non - aflatoxin (bi-ological control) A. flavus. The method involves spread-ing non - aflatoxigenic spores onto the field. It is assumed that addition of the non - aflatoxin producing strain would then allow it to out - compete the wild - type populations and thereby displace the wild - type fungus. This strategy is called a \"displacement\" strategy. Assuming this is effi-cient, the resulting treated fields should never have to be treated again, because, then, only the non - aflatoxigenic population of fungi would be present in the fields. Wheth-er or not introduction of biological control strains into the fields is enough to reduce aflatoxin contamination to level required for acceptance of the contaminated food as fit for consumption is still unknown. There is no doubt that bio-logical control strains are able to reduce the size of the pop-ulations of aflatoxin - producing strains, but the available data suggest that at most only a four - to five - fold reduc-tion in aflatoxin contamination is achieved (Ehrlich, 2014).ConclusionAflatoxins are mycotoxins contaminating large pro-portion of the food all around the world. Knowing that aflatoxins are carcinogenic, teratogenic and mutagenic agents and cause different forms of toxicosis (aflatoxico-sis), emphasizes the fact that serious efforts are needed to-wards researching and discovering appropriate strategies for prevention and treatment. The prevention and treatment should be directed towards finding strategies to protect the grains and discovering agents which will be used to protect the human body from the toxic effect of aflatoxins. Aware-ness should be raised in governments to assemble groups of healthcare workers which will contribute to lowering the aflatoxins exposure, and hopefully their elimination.ReferencesCastelino, J.M., Dominguez - Salas, P., Routledge, M.N., Prentice, A.M., Moore, S.E., Henning, B.J., Wild, C.P., Gong, Y.Y., 2014.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines promotion as: \"all informational and persuasive activities by manufactur-ers and distributors, the effect of which is to induce the pre-scription, supply, purchase and/or use of medicinal drugs\". In 1989, WHO established ethical criteria for medicines promotion that are still relevant today (WHO, 1988). Ac-cording to the principles of good practice for promoting medicines to the general public, this function is permit-ted for pharmaceuticals classified as nonprescription med-icines (over-the-counter, OTC), but should not be direct-ed at children as target audience. However, the manufac-turers of prescription only medicines are in restrictive po-sition in providing information to patients since the adver-tising of prescription only medicines to the general pub-lic is prohibited. As acknowledge, OTC medicines as part of health coverage are medicines which are approved for use without a medical prescription. These medicines and health-related products from general sale list can be pur-chased by patients and consumers through pharmacies, and in many countries (including our country), from non-phar-macy retail outlets. In this context, as no healthcare pro-fessional is necessarily involved in OTC medicines use it is evident that the nature of their promotion to the gener-al public have a special importance for supporting their ap-propriate and responsible use by patients and consumers. From all these underlying reasons associated with adver-tising and promotion of medicines, it is generally accept-ed that this pharmaceutical function in each country must comply with national health policies and regulations, as well as with standards, guiding principles and ethical crite-ria. Different mechanisms can be used for regulation of ad-vertising of OTC medicines. The aim of our study is to present the elements of ef-ficient and ethical promotion of OTC medicines accord-ing to the WHO standards, and to demonstrate the special role and benefit of OTC medicines promotion in the public health context. Moreover, the preliminary results of con-ducted analysis in the domain of OTC medicines promo-tion on domestic market are also discussed in this context. Materials and methods The varieties of OTC medicines promotional materials available on the domestic market for the provision of pa-tient and consumer information are also analyzed. In fact, approximately 30 OTC medicines from retail environment for pain relievers, laxatives, cough and cold from different manufacturer has been included in the study. Results and discussionIn general, advertising and promotional materials in-tended to patient and consumer can be available in a va-riety of forms, including: 1) printed material for example leaflets, posters then, materials in newspapers and maga-zines or direct mail materials etc. ; 2) electronic media ad-vertising form such as websites and on-line material, 3) au-dio and audiovisual advertising forms (e.g. television, vid-eos or radio commercials); 4) ''other'' forms (e.g. outdoor advertising, promotional text messages, and so on). WHO describes the purpose of advertising as: \"Attract attention, offer choices, and provide limited general infor-mation to mass audiences of consumers. It must stimulate S8 PP 315660Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 659 - 660 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsthe interest of prospective buyers in a... product; inform them of what it may do for them... Therefore, advertis-ing should not be overloaded with information to the point that the individual prospective buyer may fail to compre-hend it or may even ignore it\". Overall, the OTC medi-cines promotional materials aimed to raise patient and con-sumer awareness about their condition and, in particular about the possibility for suitable self-medication and self-care. Moreover, these materials should also advice patients and consumer about new products and/or attract their at-tention on the new indications for use of old one OTC med-icines. Another positive benefit of OTC medicines promo-tional material, but not less important, is that they can lead to reinforce of other forms of communication for exam-ple, with health professionals and as a consequence, they should promote and facilitate the rational use of OTC med-icines. The obvious example is the warning information on the promotional material stating: \"if symptoms persist, consult a health care professional\". It is well known that the OTC medicines promotional materials play also impor-tant role in patients and consumers decision making pro-cess towards selection of medicines, where there is a mul-tiplicity of choice and also direct them to medicines label-ing important for safe and appropriate use. From the prac-tical point of view, OTC medicines promotional material may also have a positive effect on patient's compliance. The OTC medicines manufacturers are competing with each other to encourage patients and consumers to use their products.Basic ethical standards for OTC promotion have to en-sure that the information conveyed to patients and consum-ers is truthful and not misleading. The concept of promo-tion is not to force people to buy and use an OTC medi-cine they do not want or need. General ethical criteria for OTC medicine advertising are highlighted in WHO assess-ment document (WHO, 2000): 1)\"While advertisements to the general public should take account of people's le-gitimate desire for information regarding their health, they should not take undue advantage of people's concern for their health\"; 2)\"While health education aimed at children is highly desirable, drug advertisements should not be di-rected at children\"; 3)\"Advertisements may claim that a drug can cure, prevent, or relieve an ailment only if this can be substantiated\"; 4)\"They should also indicate, where applicable, appropriate limitations to the use of drugs\"; 5) \"When lay language is used, the information should be consistent with the approved scientific data sheet or other legally determined scientific basis for approval. Language which brings about fear or distress should not be used\".These criteria constitute general principles for ethical standards which could be adapted by governments to na-tional circumstances as appropriate to their political, eco-nomic, cultural, social, educational, scientific and techni-cal situation, laws and regulations, and the level of their health system development. It is worthy to mention that in our country these criteria are being fully met.Other important dimension of OTC medicines promo-tion is the mechanism for its regulation. In line with this, it is highly recommended that two systems should be put in place, such as pre-marketing release and post-marketing surveillance system. Actually, the first system formally ap-proved promotional material while, the second one would secure enforcement mechanism. Patients have a legitimate right to get good quality in-formation, in a well-regulated way, from the reliable source for each OTC medicines. ConclusionPatients have a legitimate right to get good quality in-formation, in a well-regulated way, from the reliable source for each OTC medicines. In continuum, they are being con-veyed with increasing amounts of OTC medicines promo-tional materials from different parties and through multi-ple channels. It is obvious, that some information might be of varying quality and accuracy. The high standards should be applied in OTC medicines promotion. Apart from eth-ical and effective promotion standards of OTC medicines this regulatory function, alone is not providing detailed and comprehensive information on OTC medicines, but it can convey needed information for responsible self-medication by patients.ReferencesWHO, 1988.

In the Republic of Macedonia the right conditions are in the second half of May and beginning of June, depend-ing on soil-climate conditions and on larger parcels it is done by machines with special constructed combine har-vester or it is done manually.After the harvest, the chamomile is being dried in spe-cial driers which are various, with different capacities for drying and are mainly divided into:1. Driers on solar energy2. Driers on solid fuel3. Driers on oil derivates4. Driers on electric current5. Combined driers1. Principle of work and driers' role in the chamomile drying processThe chamomile as culture is very specific in the dry-ing process and the harvest depends on the drying process itself. It is harvested the whole and is haymaking, or the flower is collected by combine harvester, depending on the market demands it is intended to. The chamomile contains active and hidden moisture, mainly in the harvest phase."
