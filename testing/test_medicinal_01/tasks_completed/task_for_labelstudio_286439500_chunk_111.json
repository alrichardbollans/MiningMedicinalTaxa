      "text": "The total flavonoid content(TFC) was determined by HPLC-PDA as a sum of flavonoidaglycones released after acid hydrolysis of native extracts,and recalculated on the dominant glycosides. With the levelsconstituting 55.7-105.5% of the TPC values, flavonoids were thedominant phenolic components of all extracts except WR, inwhich phenolic acids prevailed. The highest TFC contents wereobserved for DEF (490.63 mg/g dw) and EAF (325.53 mg/g dw).As regards individual aglycones, kaempferol was the dominantone and constituted 64.4-79.7% of the total aglycones. Thecontents of quercetin and isorhamnetin were much lower andconstituted 18.8-30.9% and 1.6-4.7% of the sum of aglycones,respectively. The total TPA, determined by the n-butanol-HClassay and expressed as cyanidin chloride equivalents (CYE),ranged from 12.43 to 109.43 mg CYE/g dw, with the peak valuefound again for EAF. Contrastingly, the highest level of phenolicacids (TAC), assayed by HPLC-PDA, was observed for BF (66.77mg/g dw), while in other extracts the TAC contents varied in therange of 8.76-29.24 mg/g dw.Antioxidative Effects in Chemical ModelsAll of the extracts showed significant and dose-dependentantioxidant activity and ability to scavenge free radicals (DPPH,a stable synthetic radical), directly reduce transition metalions (Fe3+, FRAP), and inhibit AAPH-induced linoleic acidperoxidation (chemical model of lipid peroxidation) significantlydiminishing levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances(TBARS), with the final parameters strongly influenced by theextraction solvent (Table 3). Regardless of the test, activityof the extracts decreased in similar order, i.e., EAF >= DEF> BF > MED > WR, and correlated with the amountsof polyphenols (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC) in the samples(Table 4). The strongest relationships were observed for theFRAP test, whereas for the DPPH and TBARS assays, thecorrelation coefficients were negatively influenced by WR, avirtually flavonoid-free extract. If WR was excluded from thedata matrix, the impact of TPC (|r| > 0.91, p < 0.05) on theantioxidant parameters of the other extracts was evident forall tests (results not shown). In a comparison to the positivestandards, the antioxidant capacity of the most active extractsEAF and DEF was higher (p < 0.05) or not statisticallydifferent (p > 0.05) than that of an industrial antioxidantBHT (DPPH and TBARS tests), and Trolox, a synthetic analogof vitamin E (FRAP and TBARS tests). Moreover, if activityparameters of the native extracts were recalculated to GAE(Table 3) using the TPC values, the obtained antioxidantcapacities of the phenolic fractions constituting the dry extractswere comparable to all of the positive standards exceptquercetin.Protective Effects on Human PlasmaComponentsAfter demonstrating the promising antioxidant capacity inchemical assays, the extracts were examined in terms of theireffects on human plasma exposed to oxidative stress inducedby peroxynitrite (ONOO-; 100 uM). In comparison to thecontrol (untreated) samples, the peroxynitrite-stimulated plasmaexhibited a considerably enhanced level (Figure 2A; p < 0.001)of 3-nitrotyrosine in plasma proteins (3-NT-Fg, a marker ofprotein nitration), a strong increase of lipid hydroperoxides(ferric-xylenol orange assay, FOX-1) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)--markers of lipid peroxidation(Figures 2B,C; p < 0.001), as well as a noticeable decrease(Figure 2D; p < 0.001) in ferric reducing ability (FRAP, amarker of total antioxidant status of plasma). In plasmasamples incubated with ONOO- in the presence of the extracts(at 1-50ug/mL), the rate of oxidative/nitrative damage wassignificantly reduced (Figures 2A-C; p < 0.05). All testedextracts effectively diminished the nitration of tyrosine residues(Figure 2A; p < 0.001)--by about 15-50% and 36-54% at 1and 50ug/mL, respectively. The impact of extraction solventon the anti-nitrative activity was less pronounced than thatobserved in chemical tests; still, WR was again the leasteffective at each concentration level (p < 0.05). Among theother extracts, MED displayed the strongest activity (50-58%decrease in tyrosine nitration); however, only the effects ofEAF, BF, and WR were dose-dependent (Figure 2A; p <0.05). In consequence, the correlation between the percentageinhibition of tyrosine nitration and the phenolic contents(TPC, TFC, TPA, TAC) was not significant (Table 4). All ofthe tested extracts exhibited also protective properties againstperoxynitrite-induced lipid peroxidation (Figures 2B,C; p <0.001), regardless of the concentration level. In samples pre-incubated with the medium extracts concentration (5ug/mL),the levels of hydroperoxides and TBARS decreased by about47-53% and 21-34%, respectively.

The inhibitoryactivity on lipid peroxidation was dose-dependent for all extractsif measured by TBARS (Figure 2C; p < 0.05); however, inthe FOX-1 assay only some dose-effects for MED, DEF andEAF were significant, i.e., differences observed between the twolowest concentration levels (1-5ug/mL) and the highest doseof 50ug/mL (Figure 2B; p < 0.05). Consequently, relativelystrong correlations (|r| > 0.73, p < 0.01) were observed betweenthe percentage of lipid peroxidation assayed by TBARS andthe phenolic contents (TPC, TFC, TPA), whereas the analogrelationships for FOX-1 test were weaker (|r| > 0.62, p <0.01) (Table 4). All of the extracts were also able to normalizeand/or enhance the total antioxidant status of ONOO--treated plasma (FRAP), depending on the concentration used,and only MED at 1ug/mL did not change significantly theFRAP value of the oxidized plasma (Figure 2D; p > 0.05).For all other extracts, a significant improvement in theplasma reducing ability was observed with the increase upto about 190% vs. the ONOO--stimulated plasma and 140%vs. the control sample for EAF at 50ug/mL (Figure 2D; p< 0.001). Strong dose-dependency of the analytical responsewas found, and thus strong relationships (|r| > 0.92, p <0.001) between the percentage increase in the FRAP valuesof the oxidized plasma and the TPC, TFC, and TPA levels(Table 4).Simultaneously, the ONOO--treated plasma was incubatedwith 5ug/mL of standard phenolics (Figures 2A-D). In contrastto results of the chemical tests, in the plasma model thepure compounds were merely comparable or inferior to theblackthorn extracts in terms of the antioxidant activity. Forinstance, the range of percentage inhibition of tyrosine nitrationachieved for the standards (ca. 11-34%) was lower than forthe extracts (ca. 19-58%) applied at the same concentrationof 5ug/mL (Figure 2A). Moreover, the activity of MED andEAF at 5ug/mL was significantly higher (p < 0.001) thanthat of all standards. Furthermore, quercetin--the strongestantioxidant in chemical models--counteracted the plasmanitration significantly less effectively than all extracts (Figure 2A;p < 0.001). Similar trend was observed for ONOO--inducedlipid peroxidation, both with FOX-1 detection--only rutinexhibited protective activity comparable to that of the extractsat 5ug/mL (Figure 2B; p > 0.05), and with TBARS test--overlapped ranges of percentage inhibition of peroxidation werefound for the standards (ca. 26-32%) and the extracts (21-34%)at 5ug/mL (Figure 2C; p > 0.05).

In both tests thestrongest effects observed for EAF and DEF were intermediatebetween those of phenolic standards and indomethacin, a strongnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The inhibitory activitytoward both enzymes was strongly correlated with the TPC levels(|r| > 0.88, p < 0.05). The responses in the LOX test were alsostrongly TFC-dependent (r = -0.8868, p < 0.05), while in theHYAL assay this relationship was noticeable (r = -0.8691) butnot significant (p= 0.056).Influence on Cells ViabilityThe potential cytotoxicity of the extracts was evaluated in amodel of PBMCs after 60 and 120 min of incubation with theextracts at 5ug/mL. Cellular safety of the extracts was evidencedby the lack of significant differences (p > 0.05) in cell viabilityobserved between PBMCs incubated with the extracts (85.6-90.5% viability) and the control (untreated) samples (87.85-90.85viability), regardless of the incubation time and extraction solvent(Figure 3).DISCUSSIONAs beneficial for human health, including prevention of CVD,polyphenol-rich extracts are widely used in the preparation ofdietary supplements and pharmaceuticals (Franz et al., 2011).Extraction from natural matrices is thus the crucial step intheir utilization as it affects extract composition, activity, andyield. Generally, alcohol and alcohol-water mixtures are thebest extractants for low-molecular-weight polyphenols of highantioxidant potential and good bioavailability (Manach et al.,2005). The crude extracts are often fractionated to remove fat-soluble ballast substances (chlorophylls and waxes) and therebypurify and concentrate the phenolic fractions (Rana et al.,2016)."
