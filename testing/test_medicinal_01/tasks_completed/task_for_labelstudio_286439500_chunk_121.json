In the presentwork, we aimed to assess the chemical profiles and biological effects of Ononis natrixsubsp. hispanica extracts (ethyl acetate, methanol, and water). For chemical profile, totaland individual phenolic components were detected. For biological effects, antioxidant(DPPH, ABTS, CUPRAC, FRAP, phosphomolybdenum, and metal chelating assays),enzyme inhibitory (against cholinesterase, tyrosinase, a-amylase and a-glucosidase),antimicrobial, DNA protection and cytotoxic abilities were tested. The predominantphenolics were apigenin, luteolin, and quercetin in the tested extracts. Generally, theethyl acetate and methanol extracts were noted as the most active in the antioxidantand enzyme inhibitory assays. Water extract with different concentrations indicated highlevel of DNA protection activity. Methanol and ethyl acetate extracts showed antibacterialeffect against to Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Thecytotoxic effects of O. natrix subsp. hispanica extracts on the survival of HeLa andPC3 cells were determined by MTT cell viability assay. Water and methanol extractscaused initiation of apoptosis for PC3 cell line. Furthermore, molecular docking wasperformed to better understand interactions between dominant phenolic compoundsand selected enzymes. Our results clearly indicate that O. natrix subsp. hispanicacould be considered a potential candidate for designing novel pharmaceuticals,cosmeceuticals and nutraceuticals.Keywords: Ononis, bioactive compounds, natural agents, pharmaceuticals, molecular dockingINTRODUCTIONIn the twenty first century, the usage of plant or plant products are undergoing a revolutionas sources of prominent (functional and bioactive) compounds. For example, artemisininwas awarded as an anti-malarial compound in Nobel Prize for Medicine 2015 (Omura andCampbell, 2015). From this point, to better combat the lifestyle, communicable or infectiousdiseases, many phytochemicals have been suggested as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer319Yerlikaya et al. A Multidirectional Perspective on Ononis natrix subsp. hispanicaand anti-mutagenic agents (Fernandes et al., 2017; Losada-Barreiro and Bravo-Diaz, 2017; Meeran et al., 2017; Yin et al.,2017). These facts provide encouragement for designingfurther studies on the plants. Within these perspectives,the term of functional products has emerged and it isdefined as any products which provide health benefitsincluding treatment of afore-mentioned diseases. In thisframework, uninvestigated wild plants could be considered as aspringboard for designing novel functional products with lowtoxicity.The genus Ononis (Fabaceae) is represented by 75 speciesin the world especially Europe and Central Asia (Wollenweberet al., 2003). The genus comprises of 23 taxa in Tukey andknown as \"semisk\" and \"kayis,kiran\" in Turkish name (Baytop,1999; Sohretoglu, 2007; Mukemre et al., 2015). In the literature,several studies were reported that member of the genus Ononisexhibited significant biological activities, such as antimicrobialeffect (Mhamdi et al., 2015; Sayari et al., 2016), antioxidant(Mhamdi et al., 2015; Mezrag et al., 2017), wound healing(Suntar et al., 2011), cytotoxic (Kuete et al., 2013; Ghribi et al.,2016), and analgesic (Yolmaz et al., 2006). In addition, thedecoctions from Ononis species is used for treating urinaryproblems, skin disorders as well as gout (Baytop, 1999; Erdemgilet al., 2002; Liebezeit, 2008). With this in mind, Ononis specieshave been sold as herbal tea on the market as single orcombined with other diuretic plants (Gampe et al., 2016). Severalpublications have appeared in recent years documenting onbiological activities of some Ononis species along with theirphytochemicals profiles (Daruhazi et al., 2008; Al-Rehaily et al.,2014; Ghribi et al., 2015; Yousaf et al., 2015; Gampe et al., 2016;Casiglia et al., 2017; Mezrag et al., 2017). However, to the bestof our knowledge, there is no report on the chemical profile andbiological ability of Ononis natrix subsp. hispanica. Thus, thepresent study aims to provide more details about chemical andbiological properties of O. natrix subsp. hispanica. The observedfindings could be provide new insights for O. natrix subsp.hispanica.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlant Material and Preparation of theExtractsOnonis natrix subsp. hispanica was collected from Antalya-Turkey during of flowering season (June 2015). Taxonomicidentification of the plant material was confirmed by the seniortaxonomist Dr. Murad Aydin Sanda, from the Department ofBiology, Selcuk University. The voucher specimen has beendeposited at the Herbarium of the Department of Biology, SelcukUniversity, Konya-Turkey.To obtain ethyl acetate and methanol extracts, the air-driedaerial parts (10 g) were macerated with 200mL of these solventsat room temperature (25* +- 1*C) for 24 h. The extracts wereconcentrated under vacuum at 40*C by using a rotary evaporator.To obtain water extract, the powdered samples were boiled with250mL of distilled water for 30min. The aqueous extract wasfiltered, lyophilized (-80*C, 48 h), and all extracts stored at +4*C in the dark until use.Total Phenolics, Flavonoids, and PhenolicCompositionThe total phenolics content was determined by Folin-Ciocalteumethod (Slinkard and Singleton, 1977) with slight modificationand expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE/g extract), whiletotal flavonoids content was determined using AlCl3 method(Zengin et al., 2014) with slight modification and expressed asrutin equivalents (RE/g extract).Phenolic compounds were evaluated by RP-HPLC(Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). Detectionand quantification were carried out with a LC-10ADvp pump, aDiode Array Detector, a CTO-10Avp column heater, SCL-10Avpsystem controller, DGU-14A degasser and SIL-10ADvp autosampler (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD).Separations were conducted at 30*C on Agilent R(c) EclipseXDB C-18 reversed-phase column (250 x 4.6 mm length, 5um particle size). Phenolic compositions of the extracts weredetermined by a modified method of Zengin et al. (2014). Gallicacid, protocatechuic acid, (+)-catechin, p-hydroxybenzoic acid,chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, (-)-epicatechin, syringic acid,vanillin, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, benzoic acid,o-coumaric acid, rutin, hesperidin, rosmarinic acid, eriodictyol,trans-cinnamic acid, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, andapigenin were used as standards. Identification and quantitativeanalysis were done by comparison with standards. The amountof each phenolic compound was expressed as microgram pergram of extract using external calibration curves, which wereobtained for each phenolic standard.Antioxidant and Enzyme Inhibitory AssaysAntioxidant [DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging, reducing power(CUPRAC and FRAP), phosphomolybdenum and metalchelating (ferrozine method) and enzyme inhibitory assays(cholinesterase (Elmann's method), tyrosinase (dopachromemethod), a-amylase (iodine/potassium iodide method) anda-glucosidase (chromogenic PNPG method)] were performedaccording to our previous researches (Zengin et al., 2014; Zengin,2016). Antioxidant capacities were expressed as equivalents oftrolox and EDTA (for metal chelating)."
