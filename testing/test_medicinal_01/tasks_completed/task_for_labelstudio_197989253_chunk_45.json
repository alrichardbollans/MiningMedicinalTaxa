      "text": "The general rules of medicine marketing apply: marketing must not lure into excess use of herbs or be otherwise improper.13521346 Enkovaara 2002, 21.1347 Enkovaara 2002, 33.1348 Enkovaara 2002, 33.1349 Enkovaara 2002, 36.1350 Enkovaara 2002, 37.1351 Enkovaara 2002, 22.1352 Enkovaara 2002, 31.-244-Since 1986, established medicinal products do not have to go through new clinical tests. This means that a product license can be admitted based on scientifi c literature published on the substance. The literature must show that the substance has established medical use and that it has acknowledged effi ciency and acceptable safety.1353 According to directive 1999/83/EC1354, a medicinal product, also a herbal medicinal product, has a record of well-established medicinal use if it has been used as a medicine in the EU territory for at least 10 years. In practice, applications for authorisation of herbal medicines are often based on established medicinal use, not clinical tests and trials1355.If someone wants to market an herbal medicine that does not have established medicinal use in Europe, he must complete clinical trials similar to those for synthetic medicines. Under the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), there is a Committee on Herbal Medicines. The Committee was established in 2004, and it gives scientifi c opinions on herbal medicines. One of the basic guidelines concerning herbal medicines drafted by the EMEA committees is the 2006 Guideline on Quality of Herbal Medicinal Products and Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products1356.5.5.1.3 Traditional Herbal MedicinesTraditional herbal medicines are a new European regulatory category created by Directive 2004/24/EC. It is a tailor-made category for products on which there is not enough scientifi c literature to make them well established in a sense that they could be authorised in the primary procedure for medicines. Traditional herbal medicines can be registered in a simplifi ed procedure called 'traditional-use registration'.According to preamble 5) of the Directive 2004/24/EC, \"the long tradition of the medicinal product makes it possible to reduce the need for clinical trials, in so far as the effi cacy of the medicinal product is plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience\". According to Article 16(a)(e), the data on the traditional use of the medicinal product must be suffi cient, in particular:the product must prove not to be harmful in the specifi ed conditions of use, and -the - pharmacological effects or effi cacy of the medicinal product must be plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience.This means that products categorised as traditional herbal medicines, require no clinical data to show proof of effi cacy. The difference between a literature-based herbal medicine application and a traditional herbal medicine registration is that in the primary procedure, 10 years of established medicinal use is enough, and in the simplifi ed procedure, 30 years of traditional use is enough. Established use means scientifi cally established through adequate published 1353 Enkovaara 2002, 20.1354 Commission Directive 1999/83/EC of 8 September 1999 amending the Annex to Council Directive 75/318/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to analytical, pharmacotoxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of medicinal products.1355 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.nam.fi /laaketeollisuus/rohdosvalmiste/kasvirohdosvalmiste/index.html.1356 Available on EMEA web page at: http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/qwp/281900en.pdf.-245-data. The borderline between established use and traditional use still remains unclear, and EMEA guidelines are expected on the subject.Because effi cacy of traditional herbal medicines is not based on scientifi c trials, there is certain mandatory information that must be given to the consumer. There is an obligation to include in the labelling, the package leafl et and in any advertising the information that the product is a traditional herbal medicinal product and that the effi cacy has not been clinically proven but relies exclusively on long-term use and experience; and that the user should consult a doctor or a qualifi ed medical practitioner if the symptoms persist during the use of the medicinal product.Compared to chemical medicines, there is still a relative lack of rigorous clinical trials on herbals. The effi cacy of herbal medicines has been tested in hundreds of clinical trials, but this volume of data is still small considering the thousands of plants that are used as medicines. Studies have shown that herbal medicines might often have fewer serious side effects compared to pharmaceuticals. They might also offer just as effective remedies with lower cost. However, the evidence on these benefi ts is incomplete.1357 This is why the legislator has had to settle with the above- described approach, where the product can be marketed based on history of use, but the consumer has to be informed of the lack of evidence. The decision on whether to trust a traditional herbal medicinal product is on the consumer.The lack of trials is mostly due to the fact that the herbal industry is small and can rarely afford the considerable expense of a clinical trial. Public funds are not often dedicated to research of herbal medicines. The EU directive harmonising the registration of herbal medicines did not offer any incentives for companies to invest further into research. Research is needed to enable knowledge-based use of herbal medicine.1358 At the moment, a consumer must rely more on faith and less on facts when using herbals. The lack of complete evidence is possibly holding back the optimal use of herbals. There are arguments against 'history of use' as a ground for authorisation. Historically, there have been long-standing traditions of treatments later proven to be ineffective.5.5.1.4 Homeopathic MedicinesHomeopathic products can be approved either in the primary authorisation procedure for medicines according to Article 16(1) or their own simplifi ed registration procedure according to Article 14(1) of the Medicinal Products Directive 2001/83/EC. In practice, the simplifi ed registration scheme \"appears to be applicable to the majority of homeopathic medicinal products\"1359. The primary procedure is problematic as regards Mutual Recognition. In case of disagreement between Member States, referrals to the EMEA Committee on Human Medicinal Products do not apply to homeopathic medicinal products.1360According to Article 14(3) of the Medicinal Products Directive, proof of therapeutic effi cacy is not required of the homeopathic products registered according to the simplifi ed procedure. Correspondingly, the labelling of those products shall bear the following information: 1357 Ernst 2003.1358 Ernst 2003. 1359 Report on EMEA Workshop on Homeopathic Medicinal Products. London, 27th October 2006. Page 6.1360 Report on EMEA Workshop on Homeopathic Medicinal Products. London, 27th October 2006. Page 7.-246-\"homeopathic medicinal product without approved therapeutic indications\".1361 Article 15 lists the information needed in the simplifi ed procedure. This information includes bibliographical data concerning the product's homeopathic nature1362. This means homeopathic use of the product must be presented, for instance, on the basis of the literature.1363The rules of the simplifi ed procedure indicate that a consumer must get the product (s)he orders, but effi cacy is not guaranteed. A consumer may or may not believe that because the product has been used in homeopathy for condition X, it is effective for condition X. As discussed above in chapter 4, the Member States may or may not establish the simplifi ed procedure. This had led to an unharmonised state, which creates obstacles to practitioners of homeopathy. The dispute on whether homeopathy is actually effective goes on worldwide. The Lancet attacked homeopathy in 2005 stating that a review of 110 trials found no convincing evidence the treatment worked any better than a placebo1364.5.5.2 Chinese Rules on Medicinal ClaimsThe rules on effi cacy and marketing are basically the same for modern and traditional medicines in China. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains a recognised and valued source of treatment1365. The Chinese government has supported the development of both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in China. As described above in chapter 4, the Chinese intend to be a global leader in bringing herbal medicine into the 21st century by establishing modern standards.1361 If homeopathic medicinal products are placed on the market with therapeutic indications or in a form, which may present risks that must be balanced against the desired therapeutic effect, the usual rules governing the authorisation to market medicinal products are applied. This means that in these cases, the same market authorisation and labelling rules apply as to immunological medicinal products.1362 Article 15: \"An application for special, simplifi ed registration may cover a series of medicinal products derived from the same homeopathic stock or stocks. The following documents shall be included with the application in order to demonstrate, in particular, the pharmaceutical quality and the batch-to-batch homogeneity of the products concerned: - scientifi c name or other name given in a pharmacopoeia of the homeopathic stock or stocks, together with a statement of the various routes of administration, pharmaceutical forms and degree of dilution to be registered, - dossier describing how the homeopathic stock or stocks is/are obtained and controlled, and justifying its/their homeopathic nature, on the basis of an adequate bibliography, - manufacture and control fi le for each pharmaceutical form and a description of the method of dilution and potentisation, - manufacturing authorisation for the medicinal product concerned, - copies of any registrations or authorisations obtained for the same medicinal product in other Member States, - one or more specimens or mock-ups of the outer packaging and the immediate packaging of the medicinal products to be registered, - data concerning the stability of the medicinal product. \"1363 National Agency for Medicines web page at: http://www.nam.fi /english/pharma_industry/herbal_remedy/homeopathic/index.html.1364 BBC News 26 August 2005.1365 China-Britain Business Council. China-Britain Business Review Archive. -247-According to the new Chinese Standards and Measures on medicine advertising (2007), claims on the curative effects of medicines in advertisements must be scientifi c and accurate and may not contain any of the following content:unscientifi c assertion or guarantee of effi cacy; -claims of curative rate or effi ciency; -comparison of effects and safety with other medicines; -explicit or implicit suggestion that the drug can heal all diseases and is good for all -symptoms in contravention of the rules of science;suggestion that the medicine is \"safe with no toxic side effect\" or has \"very little toxic -side effect\";for proprietary Chinese medicine, explicit or implicit suggestion that it is \"natural\" and -guaranteed safe;explicit or implicit suggestion that the medicine is essential for normal daily life and -for the treatment of diseases;explicit or implicit suggestion that the medicine can help one cope with the tension of -modern life, studies or examination, and can help boost academic performance, energy, competitiveness, height and intelligence;other unscientifi c terms or suggestions such as \"the latest technology\", \"state-of-the-art -science\" and \"the most advanced methods of preparation\".The rules on therapeutic claims are thus the same for modern and traditional medicines, with no special categories for medicines without proven therapeutic effi cacy. However, the scientifi c criteria for effi cacy are not yet established.5.6 Food and Medicine Marketing: ConclusionsAs with safety, there are no particular rules on the marketing of functional foods. Again, this is because there is no legal category of functional foods. General marketing rules apply to the marketing of functional foods. Marketing must be decent and truthful. In addition, food marketing or medicine marketing rules apply. As with safety, marketing rules of foodstuffs vs. medicines vary considerably. The main difference is that foods are allowed to bear health claims, and medicines are to have medicinal claims.General rules on food marketing are largely the same within the EU and in China. The mandatory ingredient list will advise the consumer on what is in the product, and misleading advertising is prohibited. China has recently introduced legislation on nutrition labelling and nutrition claims, which is comparable to its European counterpart. Guideline daily amounts (GDA) are used as a guide for consumer.Health claims are allowed both in the EU and in China. In China, a category of health foods has been created. Health foods are the only foods that can bear health claims, and no foods can bear medicinal claims. The category of health foods is suitable for all foods with health effects, including normal foods, fortifi ed foods and food supplements. In Europe, normal foods, dietetic foods and food supplements can bear health claims. The EFSA and the Commission have defi ned the borderlines of nutrition claims and the two separate types of health claims: -248-function claims and disease risk reduction claims. The separation between disease risk reduction and disease prevention is the separation between foodstuffs and medicines.The general rules on medicine marketing are also largely the same in the EU and China. The basic law guarantees that consumers receive enough information on the use of the medicine, on its therapeutic effects, side effects, precautions etc. The law also prohibits typically unethical marketing methods such as targeting children. The Chinese government has recently improved laws on medicine marketing to tackle the serious problems that have occurred.With regard to effi cacy, which is closely related to the medicinal claim, the required scientifi c proof varies according to the type of medicinal product. In Europe, legislators have created separate categories of traditional herbal medicines and homeopathic medicines, for which no scientifi c proof of effi cacy needs to be presented. On the other hand, no therapeutic claims can be presented for these products. This means the legislator has left it up to the consumer to decide whether to trust the product based on tradition only. For regular medicines, the requirements for scientifi c tests and clinical trials are very strict, and the EMEA evaluates the evidence on behalf of the consumer.In China, foods have always been used for medicinal purposes. Medicinal products are divided into two: traditional Chinese medicines and modern medicines. Compared to Europe, China is putting more emphasis on traditional medicines and developing them side-by-side with modern medicines. China is building a science-based approach and modern legislation on traditional medicines. In the future, effi cacy of traditional medicines will be evaluated according to special legislation.The laws on marketing of foodstuffs and medicines are often disobeyed both in China and in Europe. Illegal marketing practices are common regarding health foods, dietetic foods and food supplements. These are often marketed as medicines. In China, there have been serious cases of fake medicines. With health-related products, certain factors lead to misleading marketing: Consumers are ignorant compared to businesses, consumers cannot immediately determine if the product is effective or not, and health is so important to consumers that they are willing to pay for it even if the result is uncertain. This means there are lucrative earnings available for swindlers. It is a challenging job for legislators to make deception unprofi table. -249-6 CASE: THREE CHINESE BERRIES6.1 Case IntroductionIn this chapter, we draw conclusions on the European and Chinese legal systems from an entrepreneur's perspective. For this purpose, a case concerning fi ctional health-enhancing products and their legal status is presented. This means investigating how the legislation works in the situation of three Chinese plants aimed at fi ghting the metabolic syndrome.The chosen plants are:Hawthorn fruit (1) Crataegus pinnatifi da, Chinese hawthorn)Emblic leaffl ower fruit (2) Phyllanthus emblica), andChinese wolfberry fruit (3) Lycium barbarum L.).1) 2) 3) These berries have qualities that make them promising raw materials for functional foods. We are interested in how these plants are/would be legally evaluated in EU and in China. Our hypothetical goal is to produce functional foods utilising the health-enhancing properties of these three berries, and to legally sell the products to consumers.The important legal questions are:Which are the applicable rules?A) Is it possible to sell the products as foods and/or medicines?B) If foods, will the products be classifi ed as novel foods?C) If novel foods, which are the requirements for authorisation?D) Which will be the marketing claims available?E) Exotic fruits and berries have shot to popularity in the last couple of years, particularly because of their antioxidants and vitamin C. The food industry calls this the 'superfruit' trend. -250-Food and beverage manufacturers are developing products to reply to consumer demand for wolfberries, cranberries, noni, and blackberries for example.1366 6.2 Scientifi c Background6.2.1 Target DiseasesThe metabolic syndrome is a condition where a person is overweight and in risk of getting cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This means the person has high blood pressure, low level of (good) HDL cholesterol, high level of (bad) LDL cholesterol, insulin resistance and/or glucose intolerance. The condition is called metabolic syndrome, because the risk of contracting heart trouble and the risk of getting diabetes are often associated with the same persons. The lipid (fat) metabolism and the glucose (sugar) metabolism are closely connected, and both are connected to obesity. By treating metabolic syndrome it is possible to prevent type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.Researchers link the rise in metabolic syndrome to growing affl uence, changing lifestyles and growing urbanisation1367. The syndrome is common in middle-aged and older persons. According to Hu et al., the overall prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in non-diabetic adult Europeans is 15%1368. The WHO estimates that metabolic syndrome is present in 7-36% of European men and 5-22% of women aged 40-55 years1369. According to a 2005 study, 13.7 % of Chinese adults has metabolic syndrome1370. According to He et al., the prevalence of metabolic syndrome is 46% in Beijing elderly people1371, 35% in men, 54 in women1372.1373These fi gures are important as they point out that the syndrome causes a lot of human suffering and huge economic losses. What is interesting to us is that obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are largely nutrition problems.1374 The metabolic syndrome can often be prevented and/or treated by diet, where functional foods can be one part of dietary therapy.Obesity is the basic culprit for many health problems. Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.1375 In Europe, around half of the adult population 1366 Nutraingredients.com Europe."
