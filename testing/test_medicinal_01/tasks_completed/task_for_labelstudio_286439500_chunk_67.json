Eluentswere acidified with acetic or formic acid to pH < 4 to avoid theco-occurrence of ionic and uncharged forms.Normal-phase (NP) chromatography set ups were used ratherseldom in analysis of alkaloids. Here, silica columns was elutedwith sodium acetate in methanol, dioxane and acetic acidmixture (Bugatti et al., 1987) or chloroform and methanol withtrifluoroacetic acid (Rey et al., 1993) Also, cyanopropyl stationaryphase was eluted with acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxaneor methanol with phosphate buffer and octane-1-sulfonic acidsodium salt or di-(2-ethyl hexyl) orthophosphoric acid (HDEHP)(Petruczynik et al., 2002).Alkaloids have a strong absorption in UV region andhave ability to fluorescence; thus both spectrophotometricand fluorescence detector (Wu and Du, 2012) were applied.Additionally, ESI-MS and/or NMR were coupled with HPLC toconfirm the identity and structure elucidation of new alkaloids(Paulsen et al., 2015). Moreover, preparative separation ofparticular alkaloids from C. majus extract using silica gel andsequentially elution with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate andmethanol (Yao et al., 2011) or CaCO3 and different compositionsof toluene-hexane and acetone-hexane mixtures (Horvath et al.,2010) was performed with use of LC system.Capillary Electrophoresis CECE method with spectrophotometric (DAD) and fluorescencedetection (UV-LEDIF ultraviolet light-emitting diode-inducednative fluorescence or LED-fluorescence) was also used forC. majus analysis (Stuppner and Ganzera, 1995; SevcVik et al.,2000; Kulp et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012; Kulp and Bragina, 2013);however, this technique has not yet won high popularity and it isalso limited to charged or polar compounds. Recently, Sun et al. (2015) elaborated the microchip variant of CE with laser-inducedfluorescence detection and 50% formamide as a run buffer andthis technique was applied for separation of chelerythrine [9] andsanguinarine [12]. The examples of application the separationtechniques in analysis of alkaloids from C. majus are presentedin Supplementary Table 2.SpectrophotometrySpectrophotometric method given in European Pharmacopeia(monograph of Greater celandine) may be useful to estimate oftotal alkaloids in C. majus extract. The sample is mixed withsulphuric and chromotropic acid, and heated 10min. at 100*Cin water-bath. After cooling to 20*C, the absorption of sampleis measured at 570 nm and the amount of alkaloid is expressedas chelidonine [1]. This approach was applied by (Then et al.,2000; Seidler-Lozykowska et al., 2016). However, for researchpurposes, a total-content approach should be discouraged as tooinaccurate and sometimes misleading about contribution of eachcomponent of an actual alkaloid profile.In summary, most of the published preparative and analyticalapproaches were rather routine and typical for phytochemicalstudies. However, the efficiency of standard methods oftenappeared to be insufficient. The properties that influenced theseparation and analysis processes depend mostly on the tertiaryor quaternary character, oxygenation and secondary cyclizationpattern. Among the most important features are thermo- andphoto-sensitivity, so the procedures should be carried outin mild conditions which has not always been considered.Thus, due to the diversity in physicochemical properties, evenamong compounds from a single subclass, various specializedmodifications were applied which in most cases significantlyimproved the separation.Another issue that should be addressed in future analyticalstudies is that numerous minor alkaloids have been frequentlymissed or overlooked whereas some of them have profoundactivity. The focus should be on comprehensive qualitativeand quantitative profiling under non-destructive conditions thatwould reveal the full phytochemical complexity and allow tounderstand the intraspecific and environmental variation ofC. majus.Other ComponentsCarotenoidsCarotenoids were determined in aerial parts (Varzaru et al.,2015) and flowers (Horvath et al., 2010) of greater celandine.The components were hydrolyzed with alcoholic solution ofFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299177Zielin'ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majuspotassium hydroxide and extracts were analyzed on RP-HPLCusing C18 column in isocratic mode using 13% of water inacetone (Varzaru et al., 2015) or in gradient mode with mixtureof three eluents: 12% (v/v) water in methanol (A), methanol (B),and 50% (v/v) acetone in methanol (C) in different proportions(Horvath et al., 2010).Phenolic CompoundsGrosso et al. (2014) tested different combinations: time,temperature type of extraction, and eluent composition andused Box-Behnken design to establish the effective extractionconditions for phenolic compounds. 76.8% of methanol,150.0min and 60*C were found to be optimal. Further,hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids were characterized byHPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn (C18 column: 150 x 1.0mm, 3um) andquantified using RP-HPLC DAD (C18 column: 250 x 4.6mm,5um). For both methods, gradient elution with mobile phasecomposed of 1% acetic acid in water and methanol was applied(Grosso et al., 2014). Hence, the method for phenolic analysis issimilar to some which were used for alkaloids and there would bereasonable to include phenolic compounds in any future HPLCor LC-MS profiling of this herb.ProteinsThe composition of proteins in C. majus milky sap was studiedby Nawrot et al. (2007a,b, 2014, 2017a,b). The compounds werepre-separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis andfurther, HPLC on BEH C18 column (100mm x 100um, 1.7umparticle diameter) (Nawrot et al., 2017b) or nano-HPLC on75um analytical column (Nawrot et al., 2007a, 2014, 2017a) andgradient elution with mobile phase containing 0.1% (v/v) formicacid in water and in acetonitrile were performed. Proteins wereidentified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).Micro and Macro-elementsMineral composition of greater celandine herb and root, aqueoussolutions (infusion, decoction) and alcoholic extracts weredetermined with the use of inductively coupled plasma atomicemission spectrometry (Then et al., 2000; Sarkozi et al., 2005).PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES ANDCLINICAL EVIDENCEObviously enough, the great majority of publishedpharmacological properties of C. majus pertains to thecomplex mixture or individual alkaloids. Recently, moreand more attention has been also paid to proteins from latex, thatcould significantly contribute to the observed activities. Othercompounds, such as various phenolics and chelidonic acid wererarely considered. The versatile pharmacological activities ofcoptisine [31], one of the major constituents of C. majus as wellas the less abundant berberine [28], have been widely describedin the literature but usually as compounds obtained from othersources, such as Coptis (Ranunculaceae) (Tan et al., 2016) orBerberidaceae (Imanshahidi and Hosseinzadeh, 2008).However, these compounds are also contributing significantlyto many of the pharmacological properties of C. majus.From the growing evidence obtained both in vitro andin vivo, with several examples of ex vivo studies on isolatedorgans, it is clear that four types of medicinal properties arepredominating: antimicrobial and antiviral, hepatic and gastric,anti-inflammatory, and finally anticancer. Several other activiteshave been also reported but less extensively.Activites in Vitro and in VivoAntibacterial and AntifungalThe antimicrobial activity of C. majus is attributed mostly tothe alkaloids and flavonoids (Zuo et al., 2008). This kind ofactivity was reported already in the early research on chelidoniumalkaloids, e.g., by Stickl (1928) who proved the bactericidalproperties against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureusand Bacillus anthracis) with chelerythrine [9] and sanguinarine[12] being more potent than chelidonine [1] and berberine [28].In experiments with multidrug resistant bacteria existingin surgical wounds and infections of critically ill patients,C. majus ethanol extract affected Gram-positive bacteria.Ethanolic extracts of C. majus also showed antimicrobial activityagainst Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus,(Kokoska et al., 2002). The complex composition of alkaloidscan manifest wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, arisingfrom different chemical structures of the compounds. Hence,antimicrobial activity of C. majus was also tested with a use ofdifferent solvent extraction. Antibacterial and antifungal testswere performed using 96% methanol extracts from leaves andpetioles of plants grown in nature as well as in vitro shootsand embryos (Ciric' et al., 2008). Methanolic extracts wereexamined against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcusluteus, Sarcinia lutea, and S. aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (E.coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enteritidis), plant pathogens--Agrobacterium rhizogenes, A. tumefaciens), and clinically isolatedC. albicans. Both, in vivo and in vitro derived plant materialextracts showed similar bioactivity, with a slight advantage of invitro shoots. Only few extracts were equally active (80 mg/ml)against E. coli, S. enteritidis, and C. albicans, when comparedto the commercially available antibacterial and antifungal drugs(streptomycin, bifonazole, respectively), while the rest of themshowed low or no activity (Ciric' et al., 2008).Apart from plant extracts, as it was previously summarizedby Kedzia and Holderna-Kedzia (2013), individuallytested compounds showed different antimicrobial activity.Chelerythrine [9] and sanguinarine [12] were significantly morepotent than chelidonine [1] against Gram-positive (S. aureus,S. epidermidis, B. subtilis, B. anthracis), Gram-negative (P.aeruginosa, E. coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella gallinarum,S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri), and acid-fast mycobacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. smegmatis).Moreover, chelerythrine [9] exhibited antimicrobial activityagainst S. aureus and M. smegmatis, while chelerythrine[9] derivatives: 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine [14a], 8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine [10a], dihydrosanguinarine[10], and dihydrochelerythrine [14] were active againstmethicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC50 = 0.49, 0.98, 23.4,46.9ug/ml, respectively). The strongest activity was presentedby 8-hydroxydihydrosanguinarine at MIC90 = 1.95ug/ml,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299178Zielin'ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majuscomparable to that of vancomycin (2.23ug/ml) (Zuo et al.,2008). In the ethanol extract of C. majus aerial parts there areseveral other alkaloids that show potent antimicrobial inhibitoryeffect. For instance, berberine [28] was effective against Gram-negative bacteria--Vibrio cholerae and E. coli. It damagedbacterial fimbria, thereby inhibited adhesion to the mucosalsurface (Imanshahidi and Hosseinzadeh, 2008; Wongbutdee,2009).Enzymes included in latex, like extracellular peroxidases,DNases, and lectin-like-active glycoproteins can also exhibitantimicrobial activity. Moreover, chelidocystatines protect plantagainst pests and are among the components of latex whichpresumably contribute to removal of warts resulting from humanpapilloma virus infection (Rogelja et al., 1998; Song et al., 2002;GerencVer et al., 2006; Nawrot et al., 2007b; Ciric' et al., 2008).The antifungal activity was tested with the use of plantlatex, and different solvent extracts from aerial and undergroundparts like ethanol/methanol ether, chloroform, acetone, andwater (Kokoska et al., 2002; Kedzia et al., 2003). Chelerythrine[9], sanguinarine [12], chelidonine [1], and their derivativeswere also individually tested against large number of humanand plant pathogenic fungi, i.e., Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger,Candida sp. Cladosporium herbarum, Cryptococcus neoformans,Epidermophyton floccosum, Fusarium sp. Keratinomyces ajelloi,Microsporum sp. Penicillium notatum, Rhodotorula rubra,Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Torlopsis utilis, Trichophyton sp. Theeffect of C. majus extracts on pathogenic fungi was significantlyweaker compared to the effect on pathogenic bacteria. Forexample, the MIC of ethanol and methanol extracts was rangingbetween 1.5 and 8 mg/ml against the most resistant bacteria,whereas the MIC of ethanol herb extract against the mostpathogenic fungi was 20-40 mg/ml (Pepeljnjak et al., 2003).Chelerythrine [9], sanguinarine [12] and their derivatives (e.g.,8-hydroxydihydrochelerythrine [10a]) were up to several timesstronger than chelidonine [1] (Ma et al., 2000; Meng et al., 2009;Kedzia and Holderna-Kedzia, 2013). Chelerythrine [9] was alsoable to inhibit spore germination of several plant pathogenicfungi: Sphaerulina juglandis, Septoria microspora, Fusariumoxysporum, and Curvularia lunata. It suggests the actualbiological--antipathogenic function of isoquinoline alkaloids inthe plant (Wei et al., 2017). However, no particular structuralfeature seems to be pinpointed as a determinant of antimicrobialpotency despite some variation in activity toward different strainsbetween individual alkaloids. It is rather the combination ofthem and other compounds targeting multiple sites of actionthat result in the observed final effect. This hypothesis stillneeds experimental verification for potential synergies or otherinteractions.AntiviralThe glycosaminoglycan present in the latex inhibits intracellularhuman immunodeficiency virus HIV viral migration andblocks reverse transcriptase (GerencVer et al., 2006). Moreover,individually tested five C. majus alkaloids: chelidonine [1],chelerythrine [9], sanguinarine [12], coptisine [31], andberberine [28] were able to inhibit the development of HIV-1. The first two decreased the activity of the virus reversetranscriptase at the concentrations 150-200ug/ml, whilesanguinarine [12], berberine [28], and coptisine [31] werealready active at concentrations of 50-150ug/ml (Tan et al.,1991).The chloroform extract in the concentration of 35ug/mldecreased the number of adenoviruses responsible forinducing acute fevelitis of the upper respiratory tract andconjunctiva in humans (Kery et al., 1987). The experimentswith animals showed that ethanol extract of C. majus inhibitedencephalomyocarditis virus in 45% of experimental mice,whereas berberine [28] tested in the concentration rangebetween 20 and 125ug/ml inhibited influenza virus type A andB in chicken embryos with 33-99.97% efficiency (data previouslyreviewed by Kedzia et al., 2003). These results were presentedonly once, and from that time have never been confirmed orrepeated.AntiprotozoalHerb and root water extracts, as well as sanguinarine [12] (2-4ug/ml) were highly effective in the treatment of trichomoniasiscaused by Trichomonas vaginalis. After 8-10 days of treatmentthere was no protozoa detected in genitals of nearly 64% younggirl patients."
