According to Directive 2001/83/EC882, the concepts of harmfulness and therapeutic effi cacy can only be examined in relation to each other. Safety and effi cacy are relative concepts depending on the progress of scientifi c knowledge and the use for which the medicinal product is intended. With medicines, the potential risks must be outweighed by the therapeutic effi cacy of the product.883 Substantial safety criteria as such are not given in the legislation. The authorities must weigh the evidence on safety vs. effi cacy on a case-by-case basis. Safety of medicines is thus primarily controlled via the standards on tests and trials that must be performed884. Another means to guarantee safety is to grant authorisations subject to conditions that are considered essential for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product885. These conditions include pharmacovigilance, which means that the authorisation holder must monitor, scientifi cally evaluate, and report the effects of the medicinal product. Also, doctors are required to report suspected adverse reactions. The renewal of a product licence relies particularly on data on Pharmacovigilance886. Medicine safety is also always related to information given in marketing: there are strict requirements on the mandatory information that must be given to prescribed users to guarantee safe use of medicines. This information includes contraindications, instructions on proper use of the product, dosage, interactions with other products, etc. Marketing rules will be discussed below in chapter 5. 878 'Modern medicine' is not a legal term. Modern medicines are here presented as a category of medicinal products for which there are no particular provisions in the medicinal products directive, and to which the normal safety requirements and the primary procedure for medicinal products evaluation thus apply.879 Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency.880 Regulation 726/2004/EC, preamble 13. 881 Directive 2001/83/EC, Article 26.882 Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use.883 Directive 2001/83/EC, preamble 7.884 These standards are important for public health reasons, and to enable free movement of goods.885 Directive 2001/83, Article 32(4).886 Directive 2001/83/EC, Article 24.-158-4.3.1.2 Herbal Medicinal Products Herbal medicinal products are plant-based medicines. In the EU they are used for various health problems, for example, as cough remedies, to help circulation, to fi ght muscular pain, to help digestion, as cold remedies, for calming and sleeping, as laxatives, for bladder and kidneys and as remedies for the liver887.Regulation of herbal medicines is challenging. Herbal medicine used to be the only medicine. Modern medicine was then developed and legislation created. Now that herbal medicine is gaining popularity in the West, it also has to be considered by regulators. Even though traditional medicine is available in several countries, regulation is not highly developed. Herbal medicine was probably seen as something too complex to deal with. The underlying diffi culty is that a scientifi c understanding of traditional medicine and acceptance by the international community is not yet strong. Differences in culture, history and religion explain differing attitudes towards herbal medicine from country to country. Even fi nding a common language between traditional and western medicine has proven diffi cult.888There are many legal questions to be answered regarding herbal medicine. First of all, there is a need to develop research protocols fi t for the evaluation of the safety and effi cacy of traditional medicine. Post-market surveillance systems to monitor the adverse effects must be created. There is an enormous amount of both thousands of years-old and new information that must be shared to avoid duplication of efforts. Related to information, intellectual property issues must be resolved.889The EU defi nition of herbal medicinal product is in the medicinal product directive, Article 1(30):\"Herbal medicinal product: any medicinal product, exclusively containing as active ingredients one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations, or one or more such herbal substances in combination with one or more such herbal preparations. \"Herbal substances are \"all mainly whole, fragmented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi, lichen in an unprocessed, usually dried, form, but sometimes fresh\". Certain exudates that have not been subjected to a specifi c treatment are also considered to be herbal substances. Herbal substances are precisely defi ned by the plant part used and the botanical name according to the binomial system (genus, species, variety and author). \"890Herbal preparations are \"preparations obtained by subjecting herbal substances to treatments such as extraction, distillation, expression, fractionation, purifi cation, concentration 887 Germany and France dominate the European herbals market with 39 % of sales value in Germany and 29% in France.

These include comminuted or powdered herbal substances, tinctures, extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and processed exudates. \"891 Herbal medicinal products are used both to prevent and treat diseases. They are usually used in addition to conventional treatments. They are often used in chronic conditions such as severe pain, rashes, or problems in the digestive system, and when conventional medicine cannot help. The diseases that are treated by herbal medicinal products range from minor ailments to serious diseases like cancer. There are about 1500 medicinal plants in use in Europe. The most popular ones are: ginseng (Panax ginseng), evening primrose (Oenothera biennis892), St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum893), ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba894), purple Echinacea (Echinacea sp.895), and garlic (Allium Sativum). The producer of an herbal medicinal product must have a product licence before marketing the product. In connection with the product licence, the authority assesses whether the safety and effi cacy in the presented indication can be considered adequate. To guarantee the quality and safety of the product, an herbal medicinal product must be produced in an authorised facility.896 To receive a product licence, the Medicinal Products Directive897 requires that applications for authorisation to place a medicinal product on the market have to be accompanied by a complete dossier of documents. This dossier contains information relating to the results of physico-chemical, biological or microbiological tests as well as pharmacological and toxicological tests and clinical trials carried out on the product and thus proving its quality, safety and effi cacy. This applies in principle to all medicinal products, if no exception is made in some other Article of the Directive. Article 10(a) of the Directive grants this kind of a relief, which is often used by herbal medicines: \"By way of derogation from Article 8(3)(i), ..., the applicant shall not be required to provide the results of pre-clinical tests or clinical trials if he can demonstrate that the active substances of the medicinal product have been in well-established medicinal use within the Community for at least ten years, with recognised effi cacy and an acceptable level of safety ... . In that event, the test and trial results shall be replaced by appropriate scientifi c literature.\" Factors which have to be taken into account in order to establish a preset use of medicinal products are:the time over which a substance has been used, -quantitative aspects of the use of the substance, -the degree of scientifi c interest in the use of the substance (refl ected in the published -scientifi c literature), andthe coherence of scientifi c assessments. - 898 891 Medicinal product directive, Article 1(32).892 In Finnish: helokki.893 In Finnish: makikuisma.894 In Finnish: neidonhiuspuu.895 In Finnish: punahattu.896 Enkovaara 2002, 23.897 Article 6.898 Directive 2001/83/EC, Annex I, Part III: Toxicological and Pharmacological tests. II Performance of tests. I. Well-established medicinal use. Point (a).-160-Different periods of time may be necessary for instituting well-established use of different substances. In any case, the required period of time for instituting a well-established medicinal product is at least 10 years from the fi rst systematic and documented use of that substance as a medicinal product in the Community.899 According to the Annex of the Medicinal Products Directive, the documentation should cover all aspects of the safety assessment. It must include a review of the relevant literature, taking into account pre- and post marketing studies and published scientifi c literature on epidemiological studies. Comparative epidemiological studies are particularly important. All documentation, both favourable and unfavourable, should be communicated. Particular attention must be paid to any missing information and justifi cation must be given as to why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety can be supported although some studies are lacking. If some of the data concerning a product is different from the product intended for marketing, the applicant must explain the relevance of this data. Applicants are instructed to put a special emphasis on post-marketing experience with other products containing the same components.900 Applications for herbal medicinal products are usually based on review of existing literature. What is notable is that an herbal medicine not used within the Community does not benefi t from the literature derogation. Herbal medicines used only in third countries must thus always go through the primary procedure including all the pre-clinical tests and clinical trials.In Finland, most herbal medicine product licences are based on a national evaluation procedure by the National Administration for Medicines901, which comes under the Ministry of Social and Health Issues. The National Agency of Medicines grants a selling permit for an herbal medicinal product, and simultaneously decides on where it can be sold. The alternatives are pharmacy, natural product store or grocery store. This decision depends on the purpose of use, possible risk factors, and need for guidance902. Herbal medicines cannot be sold through pyramid schemes, mail, or the Internet. 4.3.1.3 Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products As stated above, marketing of an herbal medicinal product requires an authorisation to be granted on the basis of results of tests and experimentations concerning quality, safety and effi cacy. For medicinal products that are, according to adequate published data, of established use903, there is no need to provide safety and effi cacy data. Still, a signifi cant number of herbal medicinal products, despite their long tradition, do not fulfi l the requirements of a well-established medicinal use with recognised effi cacy and an acceptable level of safety. These products are not eligible for a marketing authorisation as described above. New tests and experimentations could be carried on such products to make 899 Directive 2001/83/EC, Annex I, Part III: Toxicological and Pharmacological tests. II Performance of tests. I. Well-established medicinal use. Point (a).900 Directive 2001/83/EC, Annex I, Part III: Toxicological and Pharmacological tests. II Performance of tests. I. Well-established medicinal use. Points (b), (c), (d), and (e).901 In Finnish: Laakelaitos.902 Backlund 1998, 156.903 In the meaning of Article 10, para 1, letter (a), point (ii) of the medicinal products directive, and as specifi ed in Part 3 of Annex 1 of the same Directive. -161-it possible to authorise them under the above-mentioned procedure. However, this would be expensive and it would be diffi cult to justify animal tests and human clinical trials on products for which a longstanding tradition of use makes it possible to evaluate safety and effi cacy.904 These were stated as reasons for a simplifi ed procedure called 'traditional-use registration', which was created by Directive 2004/24/EC for traditional herbal medicinal products. The Member States have had to apply the new legislation since 2005. To maintain these products on the market, the Member States had enacted various requirements and procedures. Harmonised rules were considered appropriate, as the differing member state rules distorted competition and did not always adequately address the safety and effi cacy issues.905 The simplifi ed procedure is applicable to products which fulfi l all of the following criteria906:they have indications exclusively appropriate to traditional herbal medicinal products \"(a) which, by virtue of their composition and purpose, are intended and designed for use without the supervision of a medical practitioner for diagnostic purposes or for prescription or monitoring of treatment;they are exclusively for administration in accordance with a specifi ed strength and (b) posology;they are an oral, external and/or inhalation preparation;(c) the period of traditional use(d) as laid down in Article 16c(1)(c) has elapsed; the data on the traditional use of the medicinal product are suffi cient; in particular (e) the product proves not to be harmful in the specifi ed conditions of use and the pharmacological effects or effi cacy of the medicinal product are plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience\". The period of traditional use is decisive here. The period is 30 years, of which at least 15 are within the community area. The Alliance for Natural Health, along with other organisations, campaigned to accept 30 years demonstrated safe use anywhere in the world. They claimed that limiting non-EU use would prevent interesting and benefi cial herbs discovered in parts of the world with very strong herbal cultures (e.g. China, India, South East Asia, South Africa, South America) from being brought to Europe. They argued that the legislation would strongly impact future innovation, and have the effect of freeze-framing the industry in the early 1990s.907 The Commission and the Parliament did not accept these arguments. In the traditional-use registration, the applicant must provide the authorities with bibliographical or expert evidence to prove that the medicinal product in question, or a corresponding product, has been in medicinal use for at least 30 years preceding the date of the application, including at least 15 years within the Community. He must also deliver a bibliographic review of safety data together with an expert report. The authorities may also request additional data that is considered necessary for assessing the safety of the medicinal product.908 According to Article 16 f of the Medicinal Products Directive, a Community list 904 Silano et al. 2004, 108.905 Preamble 3 of Directive 2004/24/EC.906 Medicinal products directive, Article 16a(1).907 Wogan's Silent Betrayal web page at http://www.silentbetrayal.com/vitamins.htm.908 Directive 2001/83/EC, Article 16c(1)(c) and (d).-162-of traditional herbal medicines is created. If the medicinal product is on this list, the applicant does not need to deliver the above-mentioned bibliographical and expert reports. The herbal medicinal product may also contain vitamins or minerals for the safety of which there is well-documented evidence. The action of vitamins or minerals must support be ancillary to the effect of the herbal active ingredients regarding the specifi ed claimed indication.909 This refl ects the fact that most of the traditional combination products between herbal and non-herbal ingredients are indeed combinations with vitamins and minerals910. If the authorities judge that a traditional herbal medicinal product fulfi ls the criteria for authorisation of normal medicinal products (Article 6 of the medicinal products directive) or registration as a homeopathic medicinal product (Article 14 of the medicinal products directive), the traditional herbal medicine alternative does not apply.911 If there is suffi cient scientifi c literature to prove established medicinal use, recognised effi cacy and an acceptable safety level, the applicant should apply for marketing authorisation for the product912. The amendment concerning traditional herbal medicinal products clarifi es the previous situation, where the distinction between medicinal and non-medicinal use of some herbs was blurred913. Some food-form products with health effects now go under the defi nition of traditional herbal medicinal products. However, the scientifi c grounds for creating the category sound weak. The category was created because there is not enough evidence on some herbs, but still these products are considered safe and effective enough to be sold to consumers. The scientifi c difference between \"well-established use\" and \"traditional use\" remains unclear. Third country use applies for neither. 4.3.1.4 Homeopathic Medicinal Products Homeopathic medicinal products are defi ned in Article 1.5 of the medicinal products directive 2001/83/EC:\"Homeopathic medicinal product: Any medicinal product prepared from products, substances or compositions called homeopathic stocks in accordance with a homeopathic manufacturing procedure described by the European Pharmacopoeia or, in absence thereof, by the pharmacopoeias currently used offi cially in the Member States. A homeopathic medicinal product may also contain a number of principles914.\" Homeopathy is an alternative medicine attempting to treat \"like with like\". In homeopathy, the sick are treated with extremely diluted agents that, in undiluted doses, produce similar symptoms in the healthy. It is asserted that the therapeutic potency of a remedy can be increased 909 Medicinal products directive, Article 16a(2).910 Silano et al. 2004, 110.911 Medicinal products directive, Article 16a(3).912 National Agency for Medicines web page: http://www.nam.fi /english/pharma_industry/herbal_remedy/traditional_herbal/index.html.913 Silano et al. 2004, 108.914 According to freedictionary.com, principle means \"a constituent of a substance, especially one giving to it some distinctive quality or effect\". This means that a homeopathic product can contain several acting agents.-163-by serial dilution of the drug, combined with mixing and shaking techniques. Homeopathy is inconsistent with laws of chemistry and physics.915 Better-quality clinical trials on the effects of homeopathy are more likely to give negative results.916 Homeopathic medicines can be authorised in the primary procedure for medicines or registered through a simplifi ed procedure. According to preamble 21 of the medicinal products directive, particular characteristics of homeopathic medicinal products create a need for a simplifi ed procedure for certain homeopathic products. These characteristics are \"the very low level of active principles ... and the diffi culty of applying ... conventional statistical methods relating to clinical trials\"."
