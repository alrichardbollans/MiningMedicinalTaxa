      "text": "One species, Ribes nigrum, is the alternatehost for the white pine blister rust. The common name\"currant\" is also used for a kind of grape grownprincipally in Greece.MULBERRY. The mulberry is a false fruit -- anaggregation of many tiny fruits put together in such away as to simulate a single, larger fruit. The blackmulberry (Morus nigra) is native to Asia Minor. It hasbeen in use there for thousands of years. The whitemulberry (M. alba), also from Asia, is used as food forthe silkworm. The red mulberry (M. rubra) is native toNorth America.CRANBERRY. The American cranberry, Vacciniummacrocarpon, is a low-growing shrub of the heathfamily (Ericaceae). It is usually cultivated in a low,acidic bog. It is related to our local huckleberries andsalal. At present, the organized cranberry industry ismainly in the United States. Another species, V.oxycoccus, is native to the northern portions ofEurope, Asia, and North America.GRAPES. Vitis vinifera is native to Southwest Asia,where it has been cultivated for millennia. Manycultivars, literally thousands of them, have beenselected. Early attempts by the Colonists to establisha grape industry in the United States were largelyunsuccessful until they started to use the nativespecies. The Concord grape is such an example. Thewine industry in California is not based upon ournative grapes, but on the European V. vinifera. I haveheard one or two tour guides in the Napa Valleycarefully explain (incorrectly) that they use only good,old American grapes! More about this in the lecture onwine making.-86-TEMPERATE FRUITSCommon Name (Scientific Name) Familyacorn (Quercus spp.) oakalmond (Prunus dulcis var. dulcis) roseapple (Malus sylvestris) roseapricot (Prunus armeniaca) rosebarberry (Berberis vulgaris) barberrybeechnut (Fagus sylvatica) oakbilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) heathblackberry (Rubus spp.) roseblueberry (Vaccinium spp.) heathboysenberry (Rubus ursinus) rosebullace (Prunus insititia) rosebutternut (Juglans cinerea) walnutcherry, sweet (Prunus avium) rosechestnut (Castanea sativa) oakcloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) rosecowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) heathcrabapple (Malus spp.) rosecranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) heathcurrant (Ribes spp.) gooseberrycurrant, black (Ribes nigrum) gooseberrycurrant, red (Ribes rubrum) gooseberrydamson (Prunus insititia) rosedewberry (Rubus spp.) roseelderberry (Sambucus canadensis) honeysucklefilbert (Corylus spp.) aldergage (Prunus insititia) rosegooseberry (Ribes spp.) gooseberrygooseberry, Chinese (Actinidia chinensis) actinidiagrape (Vitis vinifera) grapegreen gage (Prunus insititia var. italica) rosehawthorn (Crataegus spp.) rosehazelnut (Corylus spp.) alderhickory (Carya spp.) walnuthuckleberry (Vaccinium spp.) heathkiwiberry (Actinidia chinensis) actinidialoganberry (Rubus ursinus) rosemedlar (Mespilus germanica) rosemirabelle (Prunus insititia var. syriaca) rosemorello (Prunus cerasus) rosemulberry, black (Morus nigra) mulberrymulberry, red (Morus rubra) mulberrynectarine (Prunus persica) roseolive (Olea europaea) olivepeach (Prunus persica) rosepear (Pyrus communis) rosepecan (Carya illinoensis) walnutpersimmon (Diospyros spp.) ebonypistachio (Pistacia vera) cashewplum (Prunus domestica) roseplum, American (Prunus americana) roseplum, cherry (Prunus cerasifera) roseplum, Japanese (Prunus salicina) roseprunes (Prunus domestica) rosequince (Cydonia oblonga) roseraisin (Vitis vinifera) graperaspberry, black (Rubus occidentalis) roseraspberry, red (Rubus idaeus var. idaeus) rosestrawberry (Fragaria spp.) rosestrawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) heathveitchberry (Rubus ursinus) rosewalnut, black (Juglans nigra) walnutwalnut, English (Juglans regia) walnutwineberry (Rubus phoenicolasius) roseyoungberry (Rubus ursinus) rose5.11 ! EDIBLE NUTSEdible nuts were among our earliest foods gatheredfrom wild trees. They were easily harvested andnutritious. Many nuts contain about 10-30% protein,55-70% fat (often highly un- or monosaturated), andthey may also be a good source of vitamins. A few arerich in starch. Their water content is low, which meansthat they will store well if kept cool.The term nut may be defined botanically as a hard,one-seeded fruit that does not dehisce (split open) atmaturity. We usually break through a hard shell to getto the seed inside. The nut may also be partially toalmost completely hidden by a leathery or spiny cupor husk. The nuts derived from trees in the oak andbirch families fit this more restricted definition ratherwell. Other fruits that are often considered nuts by thegeneral public are technically drupes, as in thealmond, coconut, pecan, and walnut. Menninger(1977) suggests the broadest definition. A nut is \"anyhard shelled fruit or seed of which the kernel iseaten....\" In other words, sometimes a nut is a 1-seeded fruit; sometimes a nut is a seed that has beenremoved from a multi-seeded fruit, as in the peanut orthe Brazil nut. Pine nuts represent a special casebecause these edible seeds are not borne in fruits, buton specialized woody cone scales of the familiar cone.By the way, the Menninger that I just quoted is thebrother of the founder of the famous clinic in Topeka,Kansas.Look for the discussion of the peanut under thelegumes and the coconut under tropical fruits.-87-NUTRITIONAL VALUESFruit % Protein % Fats % WaterAlmond 20 40-60 4Brazil nut 17-20 65-70 5Chestnut 2-4 2-5 52Filbert 18 68 5Macadamia 8 70 3Pecan 18 70 1Pistachio 18 55 5Pine nut 12-31 47-68 3Walnut 15 70 3SURVEY OF EDIBLE NUTSALMOND (PRUNUS DULCIS). The almond wasdomesticated in the Old World about 3000 BCE and isnow the world's most important nut tree. California isthe leading producer. It has wide uses in foods,candies, etc. The tree is a member of the rose familyand therefore related to the cherry and the apricot.There are two varieties of almonds - sweet (var.dulcis) and bitter (var. amara). The differencebetween the two is how much hydrogen cyanide theycontain!BRAZIL NUT (BERTHOLLETIA EXCELSA). Thereare no Brazil nut plantations any where in the world.We harvest the seeds from wild trees growing inAmazonia after their heavy wooden pods have fallento the ground. By the way, these fruits are heavyenough to cause injury and even death if you are hiton the head by one of them! Pods are split open toextract the 1-25 seeds that they contain. Brazil nutsare second only to macadamia nuts in mono-unsaturated oils. They are eaten raw, roasted, orsalted.CHESTNUT (CASTANEA SATIVA). This relative ofthe oaks and beech tree is native to Europe, where ithas been popular since ancient times. Chestnuts haveless fat and more starch than other nuts. They areroasted (think of street vendors or Nat King Cole'ssong) or boiled and used in flour, bread, porridge,fritters, and for stuffing the interiors of birds. We havea chestnut that is native to eastern North America (C.dentata), but its importance has been much reducedin the 20th century because of a fungal disease(chestnut blight).FILBERTS AND HAZELNUTS (CORYLUS SPP. ).These Eurasian shrubs are related to birch trees. Thegeneric name derives from the Greek word for a hoodor helmet, a reference to the husk that surrounds thefruit. If that structure extends beyond the fruit, it is afilbert; if not, it is a hazelnut. An unrelated use for thehazelnut is to make divining rods.MACADAMIA NUT (MACADAMIA SPP.). Twospecies of Macadamia, also known as the Queenslandnut and the Mac nut, are native to Australia. Themacadamia nut is named after a local naturalist, JohnMacadam. It was domesticated in 1858 and it is theonly Australian food plant of world wide economicimportance. It is third after the pineapple and sugarcane in the Hawai'ian economy. It is prized as one ofthe gourmet nuts because of its delicate flavor. Sothat's why they cost so much!PECAN (CARYA ILLINOENSIS). This tree is nativeto the central and southern parts of the United Statesand it is the most important native nut tree in NorthAmerica. The common name comes from paccan, theAlgonquin Indian name. A really good pecan tree canproduce 400 lbs. of nuts each year. In addition to thedelectable pecan pie, pecan oil is used in cosmeticsand pharmaceuticals. The pecan belongs to the sameplant family as the walnut. In both cases the fruit(technically a drupe) is enclosed in a husk.PINE NUTS (PINUS SPP.). Pine nuts are also calledpinon, pinyon, and pignolia nuts. A number ofdifferent pines from both the Old and New Worldsyield these edible seeds. The ancient Romans ate pinenuts; so did the Indians of North America.PISTACHIO (PISTACIA VERA). This relative of thecashew is native to the Middle East and Central Asia.The principal production regions are Iran, Turkey, andCalifornia. We eat pistachios raw or salted in brinewhile still in the shell. The seed itself is usually green(from chlorophyll) and the shell reddish. Here inCalifornia, we often dye shells a darker red. Thepistachio costs about three or four times what we payfor other nuts.WALNUTS (JUGLANS SPP.). The common or Englishwalnut (J. regia) is native to Europe, Asia, and China,where it was domesticated thousands of years ago.The edible portion is the enlarged embryonic leaves(cotyledons), as in the pecan. California is the leadingproducer. Walnut trees can live for 300-400 years.Walnuts are very popular in France and in Britain,where the Brits like to pickle them in vinegar. Thewalnut shell is often bleached with chlorine or sulfurdioxide. The black walnut (J. nigra) is native toeastern North America. It has a thicker shell that ismore difficult to crack open, but the seed inside has aricher flavor than its Old World cousin.-88-EDIBLE NUTSCommon (Scientific) Name Production Centersacorn (Quercus spp.) North AmericaAfrican walnut (Coula edulis) Africaalmond (Prunus dulcis) North AmericaAmerican beech (Fagus sylvatica) North AmericaAmerican chestnut (Castanea dentata) North Americabeaked filbert (Corylus cornuta) North Americabeech nut (Fagus spp.) Europe, N.

TROPICAL &SUBTROPICAL FRUITSOne of the most striking features of tropical andsubtropical fruits is their diversity. There are literallyhundreds of kinds, belonging to a number of plantfamilies that are relatively unknown to most of us,even to the average temperate botanist. Many of thefruits are used widely. Some of them, such as thebanana, coconut, various citrus fruits, and thepineapple, have become quite common in ourmarkets. Hundreds more are used locally and rarelyenter into regional or international trade. Commonnames abound and there is also some confusion in theapplication of scientific names.While the various tropical and subtropical fruits arenot major portions of our diet, they are often veryimportant daily foods of tropical peoples. The foodvalue is variable. Often the fruit is mostly water and oflittle value, while others are high in certain vitamins,organic acids, and minerals.While the rose family (Rosaceae) is the primary sourceof fruits in the temperate zone, it plays a minor role intropical and subtropical areas."
