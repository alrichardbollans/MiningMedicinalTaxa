The widespread popularity of Hypericum perforatum usage as an herbal remedy results from its efficacy in a treatment of a variety of diseases. This plant has been used over thousands of years to treat cuts, abrasions, bruises, sunburns and other wounds as well as to treat anxiety, de-pression and rheumatic pain. Also, this plant is thought to possess antiseptic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and gastro-protective effects (Crockett, 2010). Despite the numerous literature data about the chemi-cal composition of the Hypericum perforatum essential oil, still there is no officially available data about the chemistry of essential oil isolated from Macedonian species, there-fore the principal aim of our further research study will be assessment of the chemical composition of essential oil ob-tained from the aerial parts of this plant harvested from its natural habitats in R. Macedonia.Materials and methodsThe plant material of investigated Hypericum perfo-ratum populations is generally consisted of air-dried aeri-al parts collected during the flowering stage, packed in pa-per bags and kept in a dark and cold place until analysis. The essential oil isolation is usually made from dried and properly minced plant material by steam distillation in all-glass Clevenger apparatus according to standard meth-od described in European Pharmacopeia. The common method of choice for the investigation of chemical composition of the essential oil is gas chroma-tography tandem mass spectrometry (Bardhi et al., 2015).Results and discussionData analysis of the chemical composition of Hyper-icum perforatum essential oil isolated from species origi-S8 PP 324678Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 677 - 678 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsnating from southern Albania revealed six different classes of components: monoterpene hydrocarbons, oxygen-con-taining monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxy-gen-containing sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and non-terpene components. Generally, monoterpene (1.94-47.21%) and sesquiterpene (6.67-50.88%) hydrocarbons were dominant fractions in all tested samples. Beside terpene compounds, these essential oils contain high levels of other non-terpene components (11.68-29.25%) mainly consisted of aliphatic chains. GC/FID/MS analyses of the examed essential oils revealed a total of 126 compounds from which seven com-pounds were found in amounts higher than 3.00%: a-pinene (2.03-36.74%), b-pinene (0.36-6.89%), 2-methyl-decane (0.82-3.14%), carvacrol (0.14-5.60%), trans-(E)-caryoph-yllene (0.5-19.27%), b-selinene (1.34-13.86%) and caryo-phyllene oxide (1.15-12.35%) (Bardhi et al., 2015). The main fraction of compounds in Hypericum perforatum es-sential oils obtained from plant material collected in south-eastern Serbia were found to be sesquiterpenes (57.7%), followed by monoterpenes (22.4%), both mostly consisted of hydrocarbons. Other components present in this oil were non-terpene compounds (18.1%); alkanes, isoalkanes, n-alkanes, anteiso-alkanes and fatty acids and their deriva-tives. The main components were found to be germacrene D (18.6%), (E)-caryophyllene (11.2%), 2-methyloctane (9.5%), a-pinene (6.5%), bicyclogermacrene (5.0%) and (E)-b-ocimene (4.6%) (Dordevic, 2015). The essential oil of Hypericum perforatum collected from different localities in Lithuania was rich in b-caryophyllene (5.1-19.1%) and caryophyllene oxide (6.1-35.8%), followed by germacrene D (4.5-31.5%), spathulenol (3.9-8.5%), b-farnezene (0.6-8.2%), a-muurolene-14-ol (1.6-9.1%) and a-cadinol (2.2-6.2%). In this study, all tested samples, the amount of the most abundant fractions, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes, comprised 62.0-81.8% of the essential oils (Mockute et al., 2003). Chemical investiga-tion of the essential oil composition of Hypericum perfo-ratum was also made on plant material collected from Tur-key. GC/MS analysis has shown that the main constituents were monoterpenes: a-pinene, b-pinene and b-myrcene, followed by sesquiterpenes: a-copaene, (E)-caryophyllene and a-selinene. Hydrocarbons (nonane, decane, 2, 6-di-methyl decane and undecane) and aldehydes (hexanal) were also identified in the essential oil (Derun et al., 2013).ConclusionConcerning the literature data, some similarity in the chemical composition of essential oil obtained from the aerial parts of Hypericum perforatum collected from Al-bania and Serbia could be found, probably due to the influ-ence of appropriate environmental conditions. In our fur-ther research study, we can expect similar chemistry in es-sential oil isolated from Hypericum perforatum harvested from its natural habitats in R. Macedonia which can help to assess the potential of this plant for its further sustain-able exploitation.ReferencesBardhi, N., Stefkov, G., Karapandzova, M., Cvetkovikj, I., Kulevanova, S., 2015.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* marijabrezovska@gmail.comIntroductionOrganic solvents are widely used in the manufactur-ing process of pharmaceutical products. Their application in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients is of exceptional importance since the use of specific solvents can determine the physicochemical characteristics, influ-ence the yield of the synthetic reaction and purity of the product. Organic solvents are also routinely applied in the manufacturing of excipients and during the drug product formulation. Using standard manufacturing processes or-ganic solvents are generally removed to the extent possible from the final product. Small amounts that remain in the final drug product are commonly referred as residual sol-vents (RS). Their presence, even at low levels, may influ-ence the efficacy, safety and stability of the pharmaceutical products (Grodowska and Parczewski, 2010). Regulation on residual solvents testingICH regulation The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceu-ticals for Human Use, under ICH Topic Q3C (published in December 1997), require for \"testing to be performed for residual solvents when production or purification process-es are known to result in the presence of such solvents\". ICH categorizes commonly used RS into three differ-ent classes based on their toxicity: Class 1 (solvents to be avoided), Class 2 (solvents to be limited), Class 3 (solvents with low toxic potential). The European Pharmacopoe-ia (Ph. Eur.) and The United states Pharmacopoeia (USP) limit the amount of RS in pharmaceuticals, considering the ICH guidelines for RS. The control limits for RS are for-mulated based on the potential risks when the drug is ad-ministered orally. Class 1 contains known solvent that are human carcinogens, compounds strongly suspected of be-ing human carcinogens, and environmental hazard. The limits for Class 1 solvents are between 2-8 ppm except for 1,1,1-trichloroethane 1500 ppm, due to its environmental hazard. Class 2 solvents are non-genotoxic animal carcin-ogens or possible causative agents of irreversible toxicity and their concentration limits vary between 50 and 3880 ppm. Class 3 solvents have low toxic potential and have been found less toxic in acute or short-term studies and negative in genotoxicity studies. Their limit of 5000 ppm is acceptable without justification. A higher amount may also be acceptable with proper justification. ICH Q3C (R5) guideline for residual solvents also sets criteria for analytical methods used to identify and quanti-fy these residual solvents as well provide acceptable con-centration limits. Ph. Eur (3rd edition) and USP (USP 28,) have adopted this guideline and have revised their general methods to reflect it.European PharmacopoeiaIn general chapter of Ph. Eur, Identification and con-trol of residual solvents, two different methods for quali-tative and quantitative analysis of RS: System-A and Sys-tem-B are described. Gas chromatography (GC) with head-space (HS) injection is proposed in two systems (A and B). System A utilize fused-silica capillary wide-bore column (30m x 0.32mm or 0.53mm i.d) coated with cross-linked 6 % polycyanopropylphenylsiloxane and 94 % polydimeth-ylsiloxane while System B uses fused-silica capillary wide-bore column (30 m x 0.32 mm or 0.53 mm i.d.) coat-ed with macrogol 20000R. System A is preferred whilst S8 PP 325680Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 679 - 680 (2016)Student sessionPoster presentationsSystem B is employed for confirmation of identity. Three different sample preparation procedures are pro-posed based on the sample solubility--I: water for the wa-ter soluble samples; II: DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) for the water insoluble samples; III: DMI (1,3-dimeth-yl-2-imidazolidinone) for the control of DMF and DMA (N,N-dimethylacetamide) in water insoluble samples. In the case of water soluble samples where water insoluble RS are present, the reference RS solutions in water are pre-pared using DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide) as bridging sol-vent. Moreover, the Ph. Eur. takes into account the possi-bility of using, apart from FID, a mass spectrometer (MS) or electron capture detector (ECD). MS and ECD detectors are proposed as alternatives for FID in the analysis of chlo-rinated RS of Class-1 due to the poor sensitivity of FID to-wards chlorinated solvents.United States PharmacopoeiaCurrent official methods for residual solvent determi-nation are described in chapter Organic Volatile Impurities. USP chapter <467> suggests analysis of residual solvents using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ion-ization detector (FID) and an automated headspace sampler (HS). The three testing procedures are used to screen and identify (Procedure A), confirm (Procedure B) and quan-titatively determine (Procedure C) the residual solvents in the sample. When the user has information about the spe-cific solvents utilized during the manufacturing of the arti-cle, only Procedure C needs to be performed. If the solvents used are unknown, all three procedures are needed for iden-tification and quantization. These three procedures (A, B, C) differ among themselves in column type (film-coatings G43 A or G16 and dimensions) and in chromatographic conditions. Procedure A in the USP <467> General Chapter has the same chromatographic and headspace conditions as in System A. Similarly, Procedure B finds its equivalent in Ph. Eur. in the system configuration of System B.Sample preparation is different for water-soluble and water-insoluble articles. Three different headspace conditions are available al-though USP does not specify which HS conditions should be chosen. These are dependent on the solvent that was chosen for preparation of the sample (water or N,N-di-methylformamide), residual solvents under analysis (high or low boiling) and analyzed material (thermally stable or unstable).According to USP, determination of class 3 RS can be also done by loss on drying (USP <731> Chapter), as long as the total loss on drying is less than the maximum accept-able limit for class 3 residual solvents (5000 ppm).USP general procedures do not relate to specific sol-vents, but they try to compromise chromatographic and headspace conditions, in order to analyze all or the majori-ty of organic solvents mentioned in chapter <467>. Conclusion Methods for analysis of residual solvents described in pharmacopoeias are gas chromatographic methods that dif-fer in procedures for sample preparation and headspace pa-rameters. Proposed stationary phases for chromatographic columns and their intended used are the same. In Ph. Eur. mass spectrometer or electron capture detectors have been additionally taken into account (apart from FID). General-ly, all methods for quantitative determination of residual solvents taken from pharmacopoeias need validation.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* filip_cvetanovski@rocketmail.comBackgroundFalsification of medicines is a global problem that should be addressed with deep attention and interest. This problem represents a threat to the well-being, health and even the life of the patients, and cause a great damage on the economy and society. A medicine can be falsified regarding its identity, in-cluding its packaging and everything that is visible on it: the marking, the ingredients, the quantity of ingredients; its source (the manufacturer, the land of origin, the coun-try where it is manufactured, the marketing authorization holder) and the documents regarding the channels of dis-tribution. Falsified medicines may contain different quan-tity of the active ingredient, wrong active ingredient or no active ingredient, wrong excipients and are produced in sub-standard manufacturing conditions. Therefore the use of falsified medicine may result in no therapeutic effect or even negative effect on patient's health."
