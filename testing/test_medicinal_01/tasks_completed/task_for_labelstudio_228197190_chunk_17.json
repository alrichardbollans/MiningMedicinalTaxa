      "text": "In January 112 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2014 a new product was introduced by Omega Pharma called Bronchostop, a cough syrup which combines Marshmallow root and thyme extracts (Buttercup Bronchostop, 2014). It is marketed as a traditional herbal medicine as the evidence for its efficacy was based on its traditional use. The development, marketing, and success of new HMs suggests consumers are interested in trying natural remedies; as implied by the sales figures of Bronchostop which were reported to the value of PS4.36 million since being launched in 2014 (OTC bulletin, February 2015). Those participants who did not support the use of HMs for the treatment of cough made references to HMs having a placebo effect or not having any effect on treating a cough at all, like participant 62 who claimed that, \"none are useful (neither are any conventional medicines),\" while, participant 51 stated she only used medicines \"on prescription from my practitioner\" for a cough. For indigestion peppermint, fennel, mint, aniseed, and ajwain were the most popular HMs mentioned. Participant 85 listed senna as being useful for indigestion; however, it is licensed for use as a stimulant laxative for constipation, which can cause abdominal cramping as a side-effect, making indigestion feel worse (Chevallier, 2007). Although there is no evidence to support the use of senna for indigestion it may be something the participant tried and found useful. WHO (2006) estimated that in 2000, 171 million people around the world had diabetes and they predicted it would more than double by 2030 to 366 million people; however, in 2014 an estimated 422 million adults were living with diabetes (WHO, 2016). There are currently 3.3 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK, a condition which can affect any age, cannot be cured, and in most cases requires medical treatment (Diabetes UK, 2015). Diabetes can have serious health consequences if not managed correctly. The most popular HMs mentioned for diabetes were karela, cinnamon, fenugreek, aloe vera, and okra. Other products listed by the HCPs included bilberry, black seed, sweet potato, and gurmar. Gurmar (Gymnema Sylvestre (Retz.) R. Br. ex Sm.) in Hindi translates to 'destroyer of sugar' and it has been used traditionally to treat diabetes and symptoms associated with diabetes such as urinary frequency (Saneja et al., 2010). Many similarities between the products/ HMs recalled in this survey and the SATMED questionnaire were noted; i.e. turmeric, ginger, tulsi, garlic, mint, and aniseed were mentioned frequently by participants in both surveys. Whereas, products such as rosehip, Marshmallow, willow bark and Devil's claw were only identified by participants in the HCPs survey. Unlike the SATMED questionnaire which was for SA participants only, this survey was open to participants from all ethnicities which has enabled more varied responses to be collected. Participants from the non SA ethnic groups listed more Western herbals such 113 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra as coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara L.) and nettles (Urtica diocia L.) which are native to Europe (Chevallier, 2007). A difference in knowledge of HMs was also identified between the ethnic groups, as more SA participants (n=28) were able to list HMs for the conditions than White British/ Irish participants (n=13); this suggests that SA HCPs had more knowledge of HMs for the conditions listed compared to HCPs from other ethnicities. Overall the results from question 4 have revealed a diverse range of HMs for arthritis, cough, diabetes, and indigestion known by the HCPs (Table 3-4), exemplifying the wealth of knowledge HCPs possess. 3.6.3 Patients' Use of Herbal Medicines This section of the survey tried to establish whether or not patients reported their use of HMs to their HCPs, how often HCPs came across patients using THM, and HCPs experience and knowledge of adverse effects and interaction caused by the consumption of HMs. This analysis represents the results of 98 participants who completed this section. Question 5: Do you currently have contact with patients? This question was added shortly after the survey was launched; as after reviewing the initial responses it was decided to assess whether or not HCPs were actually dealing with patients. This was to determine how many of the respondents were actively practicing their profession. As the question was added later, 11 participants had missed the question. Of those who did complete the question 91% (n=79) said they were in contact with patients, while just 9% (n=8) were not. Participants who were not in contact with patients were generally working in academia, research, or retired; they completed the survey based on their previous experience while working with patients. In addition, some HCPs no longer had regular contact with patients but were involved in different aspects of patient care for example superintendent pharmacists responsible for the overall management of professional services across pharmacies. Question 6: Do your patients tell you about any herbal medicines they use? As many as 52% of patients in the UK have tried some form of complementary therapy at some point, with HMs reported as the most common form used (Posadzki et al., 2012). One third of HCPs (33%, n=32) who answered this question said their patients did not tell them 114 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra about any HMs they used. A small number of participants (2%, n=2) selected the 'not applicable' option as they did not have contact with patients, so could not answer the question. Newall et al. (1996) claims that doctors are becoming increasingly aware of their patients' use of HMs. This is supported by the results of this survey which revealed that 65% (n=64) of HCPs said their patients did tell them about their use of HMs. Practitioners of CWM have not always accepted the use of HMs; however, there appears to be a change in the attitude of Western HCPs to complementary therapies (Vickers, 2000). In order to build trust with patients, so patients feel comfortable telling HCPs about their use of HMs, HCPs must keep an open mind and be approachable (GMC, 2009). Vickers (1994) identified that there is an increasing use of complementary therapies across Europe, and doctors should routinely include questions about complementary therapies when taking a patients history. Upon reflection of this survey, a question about whether or not HCPs asked patients about their use of HMs should have been included; to see if HCPs were proactive in finding out about their patients' use of HMs. Heuschkel et al. (2002) looked at the use of HMs in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease and found that just 8% of doctors initiated a discussion about CAM. If patients do not tell their HCPs about their use of HMs it can have serious consequences, such as patients delaying seeking medical attention which could exacerbate their condition (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). HCPs should be encouraged to routinely ask patients about their use of HMs (Heuschkel et al., 2002). Question 7: How often do you come across patients who take herbal medicines alongside their prescription medicines? When the initial version of the questionnaire was submitted for review to the DMU ethics committee this question was created using the likert scale: 'Very Frequently, Frequently, Occasionally, Rarely, Never.' The ethics panel review of the questionnaire led them to ask, 'how frequently is frequently?' They suggested modifying the scale to justify the frequency of reporting; thus the terms 'Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annually, and Never' were used. Figure 3-7 reveals that most HCPs did come across patients who were using HMs alongside their prescription medication. Very few HCPs (3%, n=3) claimed they met patients who told them about their use of HMs daily (this would be equal to the 'very frequent' option on the original likert scale).The majority of HCPs (35%, n=34) said patients reported their use of HMs 'monthly', an equal proportion (22%, n=22) selected 'weekly' or 'annually'. Those HCPs who disclosed that patients never reported their use of HMs (17%, n=17), most worked in academia or research, some were pharmacists in managerial or office based roles (i.e. chief or clinical research pharmacists), optometry students, and a dentist. 115 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Figure 3-7 Frequency of Patients Reporting their Use of Herbal Medicines to HCPs De Smet et al. (1997) claim patients may feel reluctant to tell their HCPs about their use of HMs; this was also observed in the results from the SATMED questionnaire, where participants did not want to tell their HCPs about their use of THM. The SATMED questionnaire participants revealed they were scared of being treated differently or judged by their HCPs. HCPs have the opportunity to build a relationship and trust with their patients. During consultations if patients feel they can trust their HCP they may feel more inclined to disclose their use of HMs. Patients may not think that reporting their use of HMs is important, due to the common misconception that, 'herbal remedies are natural and therefore safe' (Ipsos MORI, 2008; Shaw et al., 2012). In some situations, such as before surgery, it is vital for HCPs to know whether or not patients take HMs as there could be complications if not disclosed (Ang-Lee et al., 2001). Overall, the results from this question suggest that more HCPs claimed that they were informed about their patients' use of HMs than those who were not. Question 8: Have you encountered any adverse effects caused by the consumption of herbal medicines? Adverse effects from HMs could be anything from a minor side-effect, such as local irritation from using witch hazel for skin conditions, to life threatening reactions like cancer or hepatotoxicity caused by comfrey (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013); 31% (n=30) of HCPs in this survey claimed to have encountered an adverse drug reaction (ADR) associated with HMs (Table 3-5). An example of a serious herbal-ADR caused by the consumption of garlic supplements was identified by participant 15, an anaesthetic registrar, whereby the patient had impaired blood coagulation which caused severe blood loss during surgery. It has been suggested that garlic can have an anti-platelet effect similar to that of low-dose aspirin; therefore, if taken with other blood thinning drugs there is an increased risk of bleeding 05101520253035Daily Weekly Monthly Annually NeverNumber of participantsFrequency of Patients Reporting their Use of Herbal Medicines to HCPs116 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra (Williamson et al., 2013). Participant 22 (a medicines information pharmacist) recalled a patient with deranged liver functions after taking Kava kava (Piper methysticum G.Frost. ); a product which is now prohibited in the UK and many other countries due to the fatal hepatotoxic effects associated with its use (Mann and Andrews, 2007). In 2006, 79 reports of liver damage associated with the use of Kava were reported to the MHRA (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013), which eventually led to it being banned in the UK. There are several well documented adverse effects caused by the consumption of HMs, including: heartburn caused by peppermint, hypoglycaemia caused by karela or fenugreek, and renal failure or cancer caused by Aristolochia species (Newall et al., 1996; Shaw, 2010). Although peppermint is considered to be a HM it is one of the few products prescribed by UK HCPs for abdominal colic or irritable bowel syndrome (BNF July, 2015). As it is regulated and its efficacy has been clinically tested, the ADRs associated with its use are well known i.e. as it's an irritant it can cause hypersensitivity reactions such as headache, bradycardia, and muscle tremor (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). However, with most other HMs there is limited knowledge and information available on the ADRs associated with their use, making it imperative to conduct more research on the safety and efficacy of HMs. Shaw (2010) claims that adverse effects from HMs may be due to the unregulated use of HMs, poor quality of herbals, adulterated or contaminated herbs, or the wrong or misidentified herbs being used. Participant 59 also listed several reasons why patients may experience adverse effects after consuming HMs, such as \"contaminated products due to poor quality controls\" and \"adverse synergistic effects with existing prescription drugs.\" Several references to ADRs caused by Chinese herbal medicines which contain steroid contamination were also noted by participants 49, 72 and 109. Pharmacovigilance involves monitoring drug safety and adverse effects. WHO (2015) defines pharmacovigilance as, \"science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problem.\" It begins during clinical trials and continues once the drug is available on the market (Sarker et al., 2015). Although, it is focused on conventional medicines the same principles can be applied to HMs (Barnes, 2003). The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) established the 'yellow card scheme' (YCS) to monitor the safety of all healthcare products in the UK, including HMs (MHRA, 2014a). Until 1996 the YCS only collected ADR information on licensed HMs; however, in October 1996 this was changed to include all HMs (Mann and Andrews, 2007). Shaw et al. (2012) claims that as the use of HMs has increased, the reports of adverse effects should have also risen; despite this, the number of reports remains low (Barnes, 2003). This was also found in the results of this survey 117 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra whereby 69% (n=68) of HCPs said they had not come across any adverse effects caused by the consumption of HMs. In 2001, 70 reports of herbal-ADRs were received by the MHRA, this formed just 0.4% of the total number or reports received in 2001 (Mann and Andrews, 2007). The latest MHRA Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 reveals that 14,836 ADRs were reported, a 12.5% increase in the last three years; however, it does not specify the number of herbal-ADRs reported (MHRA, 2014b). The Herbal Medicines Advisory Committee Annual Reports 2014 identified that 51 reports of ADRs from herbal medicinal products (excluding food, cosmetics, and homeopathic products) were received via the YCS in 2014 (MHRA, 2014c). Unlike CWM which have undergone clinical trials and extensive research to document their safety and efficacy profiles, often the only evidence for the safety and efficacy of HMs is their long standing use throughout history (De Smet et al., 1997). Traditional knowledge of HMs is not well documented, let alone the adverse effects which may be associated. In addition, peoples' lack of knowledge of the adverse effects caused by HMs could have an important role in the severe underreporting of adverse reactions caused by HMs. Educating the public about potential herbal-ADRs caused by HMs could help people use them safely and reinforce the importance of reporting via the YCS (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). The need to improve pharmacovigilance of HMs to ensure people use them safely is of paramount importance (Barnes et al., 1998). 118 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 3-5 Adverse Effects Encountered From Patients Taking Herbal Medicines Participant Number: Adverse Effects From Taking Traditional Herbal Remedies: 2 Loose stools, digestive problems, nausea, dizziness, raised liver enzymes. 15 Impaired coagulation leading to excess blood loss at surgery - patient taking garlic supplements. Excess liquorice consumption has been reported to cause malignant hypertension. 20 Hypoglycaemia with karela. 22 Deranged liver function with Kava kava. Collapse with multi-constituent product. Organ failure in baby from unidentified Asian medicine ....to name a few. 33 When I worked in Oncology there were a number of occasions when ladies being treated with trastuzumab for breast cancer asked about whether there was a problem if they were taking a herbal product. The answer was always possibly and in one case the patient taking Hypericum had her dose delayed until she had stopped taking it. 36 Renal impairment. 44 A number of years ago, i was informed by a colleague of a patient who had been admitted with liver impairment thought to be caused by an Indian herbal remedy. 49 Only Chinese herbal medicines that have potent steroids in. 56 Not so much herbal but a patient using green vegetable juices for cancer; but, also taking warfarin and ended up with nose bleeds. 57 Digestion issues. 59 Many adverse reactions due to: a) contaminated products due to poor quality controls b) deliberately adulterated products to give an effect c) adverse synergistic effects with existing prescription drugs d) side effects of herbal medicines. 60 Malignant Neuroleptic Syndrome. Serotonergic Syndrome. 61 Liver damage due to use of TCM herbal remedy for eczema. 62 Many side effects have been described in literature and in MHRA warnings. 72 Renal failure after use of an aphrodisiac steroids in skin cream leading to skin thinning. 75 Severe GI bleed resulting in prolonged ICU admission, herbal medicine was for memory (not exactly sure as it has been some time since) but was not gingko. 79 Use of garlic. 82 Unsure whether traditional remedies were the causative item but dramatic increase in blood pressure for heart failure patient when taking both traditional and Western medicines , but this was about 10 years ago. 100 Urticaria. 109 Many years ago a patient taking a Chinese tea remedy which had steroids in it. 119 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 9: Are you aware of any interactions between herbal medicines and conventional Western medicines?"
