The measurements were performed for solutionsin fully deuterated DMSO or methanol at 298 K. Standard1D and 2D experiments like double quantum filtered COSY,TOCSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC were used as supplied bythe manufacturer. Chemical shifts were referenced internally tothe residual, non-deuterated solvent signal for 1H (d = 2.50 ppmfor DMSO, d = 3.31 ppm for methanol) or to the carbon signalof the solvent for 13C (d = 39.52 for DMSO, d = 49.00 ppm formethanol). The analysis of the 1H NMR multiplett structureswas assisted by spin simulations using DAISY within the TopspinSoftware (Bruker BioSpin).LC-MS analyses were carried out on an UltiMate 3000 RSLC-series system (Dionex, Germering, Germany) coupled to a 3Dquadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer via an orthogonal ESIsource (HCT, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The HPLCparameters were as described above. The eluate flow was split1:4 before entering the ESI ion source, which was operated asfollows: capillary voltage: +3.5/-3.7 kV, nebulizer: 26 psi (N2),dry gas flow: 9 L/min (N2), and dry temperature: 340*C.

Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assayobtained in automated data-dependent acquisition mode usinghelium as collision gas, an isolation window of 1m/z = 4, anda fragmentation amplitude of 1.0 V. In addition, compounds13 and 14 were measured on the HCT instrument by directinfusion after addition of ammonium acetate as additive togenerate [M+NH4]+ ions. HRESIMS spectra of compound 3were recorded on a maXis HD ESI-Qq-TOF mass spectrometer(Bruker Daltonics) by direct infusion. The sum formulas ofthe detected ions were determined using Bruker CompassDataAnalysis 4.2 based on the mass accuracy (1m/z <= 2 ppm)and isotopic pattern matching (SmartFormula algorithm).Plant MaterialAerial parts of S. lucida were collected on April 20th 2012, alongthe Mediterranean coast east of Dalyan and south of Ortaca(latitude: 36.808838, longitude: 28.735583). The material wasauthenticated by Dr. Ozkan Eren, Department of Biology, AdnanMenderes University, using the serial \"Flora of Turkey and theEast Aegean Islands\" (Davis, 1968-1985). Voucher specimen(Herbarium code: AYDN No. : 2601) in duplicates was depositedin the herbarium of Department of Biology, Adnan MenderesUniversity.Extraction and IsolationThe freeze-dried and pulverized material of S. lucida (1.8 kg) wasextracted with methanol at the ratio of 1:10 at room temperatureby maceration on a shaker overnight. The combined solutionswere evaporated at 40*C resulting in 158 g crude methanolextract; 140 g of the extract were fractionated in four portions,whereby each portion was dissolved in 300 mL MeOH-H2O(10:1) and partitioned three times with 300 mL petroleumether, each, to remove chlorophyll, waxes, and fatty matters.The MeOH-H2O phase was then diluted with 300 mL H2Oand partitioned with three times 600 mL chloroform. Afterwashing the organic layer with 1% aqueous NaCl solution andevaporation, 15.6 g chloroform fraction (CF) was obtained. Fromthe remaining MeOH-H2O fraction, MeOH was removed andthe aqueous residue partitioned with three times 280 mL ethylacetate, resulting in 12.3 g ethyl acetate fraction (EF) and 110.2 gaqueous fraction (AF) after evaporation.Ten grams of EF were separated by column chromatography(CC; 3 cmx 60 cm) on Sephadex LH-20 under elution with 50%MeOH yielding 15 combined fractions (a-o). In fractions k andl, compound 1 was identified by TLC and LC-DAD. Fractionse (1 g) and g (580 mg) were further fractionated on the samestationary phase under elution with 30% MeOH, resulting infractions e1-e22 and g1-g19. From fraction e18, 46.5 mg ofcompound 2 precipitated. Solid phase extraction (Megabond ElutC18 cartridge; 12 mL; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, United States;sequential elution with 20, 30, 40, and 50% MeOH) of fractione22 resulted in the isolation of compound 3 (7 mg) and theidentification of compound 4. A major component from fractiong6 (63.2 mg) was finally purified by another CC on SephadexLH-20 under elution with H2O to yield 27 mg compound 5. Infraction g10, compounds 6 and 7 were identified, and in fractiong19, compound 8 was confirmed.FIGURE 1 | MCF-7 spheroids pre-treated for 30 min with solvent (Co) orindicated concentration of different fractions, placed on top of LECmonolayers, and co-cultivated for 4 h when CCIDs were analyzed. Threeindependent experiments with at least 15 replicates were analyzed. Error barsindicate means +- SEM and asterisks significance (t-test).A portion of CF (3.9 g) was submitted to CC on silicaand elution with CHCl3-MeOH-H2O (75:15:1.5), resulting in25 fractions, five of which (A-E) were further investigated. Infraction A (62.5 mg), compound 9 was identified as the majorcomponent. In fraction B (150.8 mg), three major compounds(10-12) besides 8 were detected and tentatively identified byLC-MS. From fraction C (150.9 mg), compound 13 (144.7 mg)and from fraction D (630.5 mg), compound 14 (532 mg) wereobtained. Fraction E (125.9 mg) contained a complex mixture ofeasy decomposable substances and attempts to isolate those byCC were not successful.Astragalin (1): Rf in TLC: system 1 = 0.50; system 2 = 0.74.Homoplantaginin (2): yellowish amorphouspowder;1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data: see Table 1;+ESIMS m/z 463.1 [M+H]+; +ESIMS2 (463.1-)m/z 301.3 (100); +ESIMS3 (463.1 - 301.3 -) m/z 286.3(100); +ESIMS4 (463.1 - 301.3 - 286.3 -) m/z 240.1 (10),186.2 (28), 168.3 (100), 167.1 (11), 121.5 (25), and 120.5 (14);-ESIMS m/z 461.0 [M-H]-; -ESIMS2 (461.0 -) m/z 446.2(45), 299.2 (100), 298.2 (17), 297.2 (16), 285.2 (20), 284.2 (73),and 283.2 (57); -ESIMS3 (461.0- 299.2-) m/z 284.2 (100);and -ESIMS3 (461.0- 284.2-) m/z 255.2 (100), 239.1 (10),227.1 (51), 211.1 (21), 183.1 (11), and 137.2 (11).2''-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin (3): yellowish amorphouspowder;1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data: see Table 1; +ESIMS m/z505.0 [M+H]+; +ESIMS2 (505.0-) m/z 301.3 (100); +ESIMS3(505.0- 301.3-) m/z 286.3 (100); +ESIMS4 (505.0- 301.3- 286.3-) m/z 186.1 (18), 168.3 (100), 140.2 (20), and 121.4Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 304235fphar-09-00304 March 28, 2018 Time: 17:7 # 4Lewenhofer et al.
