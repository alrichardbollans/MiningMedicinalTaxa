Newmaster et al. (2013)Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378335fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 4Raclariu et al. DNA Metabarcoding for Authentication of Veronica officinalis Productstested 44 herbal products sold in North America using DNAbarcoding and found that 59% contained species not listedon the label, and only 2 out of 12 screened companies hadproducts free of substitution, contamination or unreportedfillers. DNA metabarcoding, a combination of high-throughputsequencing (HTS) and polymerase chain reaction based DNAamplification, provides simultaneous taxonomic identificationof taxa from samples containing DNA from different origins(Taberlet et al., 2012). DNA metabarcoding studies are providinginsights into species composition of complex mixtures of DNAsuch as processed herbal products. For example, Coghlanet al. (2012) evaluated the species composition of fifteenhighly processed traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) andfound that these contained species and genera included onCITES appendices I and II. Similarly, Cheng et al. (2014)found a high level of contamination within 27 investigatedherbal preparations, Ivanova et al. (2016) found that all 15tested herbal supplements contained species not listed on theproduct label, and Raclariu et al. (2017) authenticated 78Hypericum perforatum herbal products and found the targetspecies in only 68% products while detecting incongruencebetween constituent species and those listed on the label in allproducts.In this study we test the hypothesis that dwindling availabilityof wild V. officinalis has resulted in admixture of V. chamaedrysand other Veronica species in Veronica herbal products.Substitution of V. officinalis with V. chamaedrys would notonly be fraudulent from a commercial perspective, but wouldalso leave anticipating consumers with a herbal product withoutproven therapeutic activity. We approach this hypothesis usingDNA metabarcoding and HPLC-MS to authenticate and detectspecies diversity in European Veronica herbal products, and aimto answer the following research questions: (1) Can HPLC-MSbe used to distinguish V. officinalis from V. chamaedrys and toidentify exclusive presence of V. officinalis in herbal products? ;(2) Can DNA metabarcoding be used to test for the presenceof V. officinalis in herbal products, to detect substitution andadulteration for other Veronica species and/or presence of otheroff label plant species?MATERIALS AND METHODSSample CollectionSixteen single and multi-ingredient herbal products includingV. officinalis on the label were purchased from retail stores andpharmacies (14) and via e-commerce (2). The products includedherbal teas (12), extracts (2), capsules (1), and candies (1).An overview of the samples is included in the SupplementaryTable S1, but identifying information on the producer/importer,product name, lot number, expiration date is withheld foranonymity. The herbal products were imported to Norway underNorwegian Medicines Agency license no. 16/04551-2.For DNA barcoding, nrITS reference sequences of 118accessions belonging to 56 Veronica species were compiled intoa barcode reference database, consisting partly of sequencesmined from NCBI/GenBank and partly of sequences generatedwithin the project from specimens collected in 2014 and 2015(Supplementary Table S2). For the phytochemical analyses, aerialparts of V. officinalis and V. chamaedrys (samples marked withan asterisk in Supplementary Table S2) were used as referencesfor the identification and quantification of the main compounds.Voucher specimens of the plant material used in this study aredeposited in the Herbarium of the Alexandru Borza BotanicalGarden (CL) of Babes-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, Romania(Supplementary Table S2).Phytochemical AnalysisHigh-Performance LiquidChromatography-Mass Spectrometry(HPLC-MS)Extracts were prepared from plant material and herbal productsfollowing established procedures (Cris,an et al., 2010; Mocan et al.,2015a,b), with slight modifications. One gram of each samplewas extracted with 10 ml of 70% ethanol (HPLC grade) at roomtemperature for 1 h in a sonication bath (Polsonic 3, PolsonicInc., Poland). The extracts were filtered through MN 615 filterpaper (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Germany) and stored at 4*Cuntil further analysis. Prior to HPLC-MS analysis the extractswere syringe filtered with a 0.45 um nylon membrane (WhatmanInc., United States).Target Veronica iridoids (aucubin, catalpol, catalposide, andveronicoside) from all sixteen herbal products as well as aerialplant parts were analyzed by HPLC-MS on a Agilent 1100liquid chromatography system equipped with a binary pump,autosampler, thermostat and detector (all 1100 Series fromAgilent Inc., United States). The system was controlled withData Analysis software (version B01.03, Agilent Inc., UnitedStates). The separation was carried out on an Atlantis HILIC3.5 um (100 mm x 3.0 mm i.d.) (Waters Inc., UnitedStates) column equipped with an online 0.2 um filter (AgilentInc. ), at a working temperature of 40*C, a flow rate of0.75 ml/min and an injection volume of 6 ul. A binarygradient system with eluent (A) 0.1% acetic acid and 20 uMsodium acetate in water, and eluent (B) 0.1% acetic acidand 20 uM sodium acetate in acetonitrile was used for theanalyzed samples with the following gradient: 95-80% B (1-5 min). The HPLC system was coupled with an Agilent IonTrap 1100 SL mass spectrometer equipped with an electrosprayionisation (ESI) source and operated in the positive modewith a scan range between 360 and 680 m/z, to identify thetarget compounds based on their sodium adducts (M+23 m/z):aucubin (369 m/z), catalpol (385 m/z), catalposide (505 m/z)and veronicoside (489 m/z), and by comparison with analyticalstandards in the same chromatographic conditions. The capillaryvoltage was set to 4 kV and the capillary temperature to325*C. Nitrogen (N2) was used as dry gas with a dry flowof 12 l/min and a pressure of 60 psi for the nebulizer.For quantitation of the iridoids, stock solutions of the fourcommercially available standards substances (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, Missouri, United States) were prepared in acetonitrile,and different concentrations of each standard were used.

DNA Metabarcoding for Authentication of Veronica officinalis ProductsR2 >= 0.99. The results are expressed as ug per g of dry weightmaterial (ug/g dw).Genetic AnalysisDNA Extraction, PCR Amplification and DNASequencingThe total DNA was extracted from 300 mg of each homogenizedherbal product or silica gel dried leaves, using a modifiedCTAB extraction protocol (Doyle and Doyle, 1987; Kool et al.,2012). Two extraction negative controls were included toscreen for contamination and cross-contamination. Total DNAextracts of the herbal products were quantified and assessed forfragmentation with a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced AnalyticalTechnologies, Inc., Ankeny, IA, United States) using the DNF-488-33 HS (High Sensitivity) genomic DNA Reagent Kit (50 -40000 bp). Total DNA extracts of silica gel dried leaves werequantified with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies,Carlsbad, CA, United States) using the dsDNA BR (Broad-Range) kit. PCR amplification using nrITS primers, ITS-4and ITS-5 (White et al., 1990), was done on purified totalDNA from the dried leaves, using a final reaction volume of25 ul, including 2.5 ul 10X reaction buffer II (supplied withthe polymerase), 2.5 ul 25 mM MgCl2 (supplied with thepolymerase), 0.2 ul 5 U/ml AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase (AppliedBiosystems, Foster City, CA, United States), 2.5 ul 10 uM dNTPs(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States), 2.5 ul10 uM of each primer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo, UnitedStates), 2.5 ul 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumen (BSA) (RocheDiagnostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), 9.3 ul of Milli-Qultrapure water and 0.5 ul of template DNA solution (1 ng/ul).The PCR cycling protocol consisted of initial denaturation at94*C for 2.5 min, followed by 32 cycles of denaturation at 94*Cfor 30 s, annealing at 53*C for 30 s, and elongation at 72*Cfor 50 s, followed by a final elongation step at 72*C for 4 min.Three PCR negative controls were included per amplificationto control for external and cross-sample contamination. 6 ulof each PCR products was purified using 2 ul 10 times dilutedExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH, United States)by incubation at 37*C for 45 min followed by 15 min at 80*C.Sequencing was performed using the ABI BigDye Terminatorsequencing buffer and the v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (AppliedBiosystems, Foster City, CA, United States) on an ABI3130XLautomated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,United States). The sequences were edited, and the forward andreverse sequences assembled using SeqTrace (Stucky, 2012). Thesequences were submitted to NCBI/GenBank and their accessionnumbers are listed in the Supplementary Table S2.Barcode Gap AnalysisThe reference sequences of 118 accessions belonging to 56Veronica species were aligned using AliView (Larsson, 2014),and pairwise genetic distances between the accessions werecalculated using MEGA 6.0 (Tamura et al., 2013) for each ofthe following regions: nrITS1, nrITS2, and the entire nrITS.Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) (Puillandre et al.,2012) was used to determine the genetic distance thresholdand automatically define species delimitation hypotheses. ABGDdetermines the number of groups (hypothetical species) withina dataset using pairwise sequence distances and two inputvariables, prior intraspecific diversity (P) and minimum gapwidth (X) (Puillandre et al., 2012). Based on this informationABGD makes an initial partition of the supplied sequencesinto candidate species groups based on a statistically inferredbarcode gap and then applies recursive partitions to each groupto generate subsequent partitions into candidate species until nofurther splitting occurs (Puillandre et al., 2012). The minimumgap width (X) was set to X = 1.0, the prior intraspecific diversity(P) was set to range from 0.001 to 0.1, and the p-distance, Jukes-Cantor (JC) and Kimura 2 Parameter (K2P) distance metrics wereused in the ABGD analyses (Jukes and Cantor, 1969; Kimura,1980), resulting in 18 analyses (6 per dataset). Default values wereused for all other parameters (steps: 10 and Nb bins: 20). Thetotal numbers of groups corresponding to the prior intraspecificdivergence (P) values, ranging from 0.001 to 0.1, were recorded(Supplementary Table S3).To determine whether V. officinalis can be unambiguouslydifferentiated from its main adulterant, V. chamaedrys, usingmolecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs), the intra- andinterspecific variation of all reference sequences of these species,respectively, 16 accessions belonging to V. officinalis and 9 toV. chamaedrys, were analyzed based on pairwise comparisonof nrITS genetic distances using Taxon DNA/SpeciesIdentifier v1.7.8 (Meier et al., 2006).DNA MetabarcodingFusion primers of the internal transcribed spacers nrITS1 andnrITS2, based on primers 17SE and 5.8I1, and 5.8I2 and 26SE(Sun et al., 1994) (Biolegio B.V., the Netherlands), were usedto generate PCR based amplicons. Forward primers were fusedwith a unique 10 bp multiplex identifier (MID) tags and thereverse primers with a truncated version of adapter P1 (trP1)tags. Expected amplicon sizes were 300-350 bp. PCR reactionson DNA extracted from the herbal products were carried outin final reaction volumes of 25 ul including 0.5 ul of templateDNA solution (ranging from 0.5 to 2 ng/ul), 5 ul 5X Q5reaction buffer (New England Biolabs Inc., United Kingdom),1.5 ul 10 uM of each primer (Biolegio B.V., the Netherlands),0.5 ul 10 mM dNTPs, 0.25 ul 20 U/ul Q5 High-Fidelity DNAPolymerase (New England Biolabs Inc., United Kingdom), 5 ul5X Q5 High GC enhancer and 10.75 ul of Milli-Q ultrapurewater. The PCR cycling protocol consisted of initial denaturationat 98*C for 30s, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98*Cfor 10s, annealing at 56*C for nrITS1 or 71*C for nrITS2 for30 s, and elongation at 72*C for 30 s, followed by a finalelongation step at 72*C for 2 min. Eight PCR negative controlswere included per amplification to control for external and cross-sample contamination.Agencourt AMPure XP PCR purification (Beckman CoulterInc., United States) was used for high-throughput purificationof PCR amplicons. The size, purity and the molar concentration(nmol/l) of each amplicon library was measured using aFragment AnalyzerTM (Advanced Analytical Technologies Inc.,United States) with a DNF-910 dsDNA Reagent Kit (35-1,500 bp), equimolar pools (2 ng/ul/library) were preparedFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org June 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 378337fphar-08-00378 December 19, 2017 Time: 13:31 # 6Raclariu et al. DNA Metabarcoding for Authentication of Veronica officinalis Productsfrom the amplicon libraries using a Biomek 4000 LaboratoryAutomation Workstation (Beckman Coulter Inc., United States).To identify the optimum bead-to-template ratio for templatepreparation, the concentration of the purified pooled ampliconlibraries was analyzed with a Fragment AnalyzerTM (AdvancedAnalytical Technologies, Inc., United States) using a DNF-488High Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit. The pooled IonAmpliSeq libraries (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher ScientificInc., United States) for emulsion PCR and sequencing chiploading were prepared using an Ion Chef (LT). The DNA templateconcentration was adjusted to the number of Ion Sphere Particles(ISPs) and added to the emulsion PCR master mix. The template-positive ISPs were enriched and sequenced on an Ion TorrentPersonal Genome Machine (LT) using Ion 318 v2 chips (LT) andthe Ion PGM Sequencing 400 kit (LT). Sequencing read data wasinitially processed and demultiplexed based on MIDs into FASTQfiles using Ion Torrent Suite Software version 5.0.4 (LT).Bioinformatics AnalysisSequencing reads were processed using the HTS barcode-checkerpipeline freely available at https://github.com/naturalis/HTS-barcode-checker (Lammers et al., 2014). The nrITS1 and nrITS2primer sequences were used to split the reads based on theprimer sequence. Read lengths and Phred quality scores wereassessed using PRINSEQ (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011), andbased on these values reads with a mean Phred quality score ofless than 26 and a length of less than 300 bp were filtered out.The remaining reads were trimmed to a maximum length of350 bp. Reads were clustered into MOTUs using three differentsequence similarity thresholds during clustering, respectively, 97,99 and 100%, with a minimum of 10 reads per cluster using CD-HIT-EST (Li and Godzik, 2006). A representative sequence fromeach MOTU was taxonomically assigned using local Basic LocalAlignment Search Tool (local BLAST) (Altschul et al., 1990),with a maximum e-value of 0.05 and a minimum hit length of100 bp, against a reference database consisting of a local copy ofthe NCBI nucleotide database (Benson et al., 2013)."
