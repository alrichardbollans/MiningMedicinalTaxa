Cyril and Methodius University, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* ecilku@yahoo.comIntroductionBiochemical reactions in the body generate reactive oxygen species, which can damage important bio-mol-ecules, leading to several disease conditions (Bhatt and Negi, 2012). Antioxidants are compounds which have the ability to trap the free radicals. In recent years, the interest in finding naturally occurring antioxidants has increased considerably for use in foods or medicinal materials to re-place synthetic antioxidants, which are being restricted due to their carcinogenicity (Zheng and Wang, 2001). Majority of the antioxidants from plants are secondary metabolites like phenolic and flavonoids that have been reported to be potent free radical scavengers (Baba and Malik, 2014). Resistance to available antibiotics is increasing at a very alarming stage globally. The antibacterial activity of plants is continuously attracting global attention. Plants, as the source of medicine, have been playing an impor-tant role in the health services around the world (Subedi et al., 2012). All crude extracts from plants represent a valu-able source of antioxidant and antibacterial agents, as well (Hossain et al., 2014). Recently, there have been great efforts to find safe and potent natural antioxidants and antibacterial agents from various plant sources. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant and antibac-terial activity of ethanol extracts of leaves of Betula pendu-la L., Tusilago farfara L., Plantago major L., Urtica dioi-ca L., Rosmarinus officinalis L. and Melissa officinalis L.Materials and methodsDried leaves of Betula pendula L., Tusilago farfara L., Plantago major L., Urtica dioica L., Rosmarinus officina-lis L. and Melissa officinalis L. were purchased from the botanical departments of Macedonian manufacturers.The crude extracts were prepared by extraction of grounded dried leaves of plants with ethanol. The total phenolic content was quantified by Folin-Ciocalteu meth-od and was expressed as Gallic acid equivalents (GAE), milligram's per 1 gram of dry weight. The total flavonoids content was quantified by Aluminum chloride method, which was expressed as milligrams of quercetin equiva-lents (QE) per gram of dry extracts. In vitro antioxidant ac-tivity was carried out by DPPH assay and expressed as IC50 (Gyamfi et al., 1999). The antibacterial activity was car-ried out by well diffusion method. This activity was quali-tatively assessed by presence or absence of inhibition zone (Perez et al., 1999).Results and discussionThe total phenolic content was ranged as fol-lowed: Melissa officinalis L.(181.98+-0.6016 GAE mg/g)>Rosmarinus officinalis L. (179.03+-0.4171 GAE mg/g)>Tusilago farfara L.(169.59+-0.5840 GAE mg/g)>Betula pendula L. (169.12+-0.0834 GAE mg/g)>Plantago ma-jor L. (128.9+-0.8343 GAE mg/g)>Urtica dioica L. (70.71+-0.6516 GAE mg/g). The total flavonoid con-tent was 154.52+-2.5534 QE mg/g, 115.13+-0.1178 QE mg/g,142.3+-5.0675 QE mg/g, 58.47+-0.6123 QE mg/g, S3 PP 137294Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 293 - 294 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentations75.97+-0.4249 QE mg/g and 25.63+-1.0606 QE mg/g, re-spectively. Ranking based on the antioxidant activity was: Melissa officinalis L. (2.6 ug/ml)>Rosmarinus offi-cinalis L. (78.58 ug/ml)>Tusilago farfara L. (140.9 ug/ml)>Betula pendula L. (244.45 ug/ml)>Plantago major L. (295.9 ug/ml)>Urtica dioica L. (458.7 ug/ml).Sensitivity of test strains, in decreasing order, was as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027>Entero-coccus faecalis ATCC 19433>Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 >Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 >Klebsiella pneu-moniae ATCC 700603>Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923.Melissa officinalis L. showed the highest total pheno-lic and flavonoids content and the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity, followed by Rosmarinus officinalis L. and Tusilago farfara L. It is known that phenolic com-pounds in plant extracts contribute significantly to their an-tioxidant potential because of their unique structure (Bhatt and Negi, 2012). Betula pendula L. showed moderate anti-oxidant properties beside the high phenolic content. Plan-tago major L. showed moderate antioxidant properties. Urtica dioica L. showed the lowest total phenolic and fla-vonoids content and the weakest DPPH radical scaveng-ing activity.According to the results of antimicrobial screening, Rosmarinus officinalis L. showed strong antibacterial ac-tivity against all six bacterial stains. Tusilago farfara L., showed strong antibacterial activity towards the investigat-ed bacteria except the weak antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603. Betula pendula L. has been shown to pos-sess the strongest antimicrobial activities against Entero-coccus faecalis ATCC 19433 and Pseudomonus aerugino-sa ATCC 9027. Plantago major L. and Urtica dioica L. ex-hibited strong antimicrobial activity towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, weak activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 700603. Melissa officinalis L. shows moderate antibacterial activi-ty against gram (+) bacteria and very weak or no activity against gram (-) bacteria.ConclusionThe results indicated that all of the plant extracts test-ed in this study could be considered promising antioxidant sources and great potential as antibacterial compounds against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.ReferencesBaba, S.A., Malik, S.A., 2014.

Macedonia* darinka.gorgieva@ugd.edu.mkIntroductionDuring the intensive research in past decades, the sci-entific community and regulatory agencies also, focused their interest on measuring contaminant levels in tissues and environmental samples and on understanding the mechanisms of toxicity of different and pervasive contam-inants. Among them, metals were always in focus because of possible detrimental and long lasting effects on living organisms (Gjorgieva et al., 2011; Stafilov et al., 2010). DNA damage and genotoxic stress are important param-eters that are followed in a case of chemicals exposition as an indication of carcinogenicity (Aydin et al., 2015; Kekec et al., 2010; Villatoro-Pulido et al., 2013). Plants are unique systems in their ability to serve as in situ monitors for environmental genotoxins. Molecular assays related to DNA-based techniques, like Random Amplified Polymor-phic DNA (RAPD), are very sensitive method of screening for nucleotide sequence polymorphisms that are random-ly distributed throughout the investigated genome (Gjor-gieva et al., 2012). The current study was designed to assess the effects of long term, high metal exposition (cadmium, lead, copper, nickel and zinc) on DNA damage. Materials and methodsFour different plants [Taraxacum officinale (Astera-ceae), Matricaria recutita L. (Asteraceae), Robinia pseu-doacacia L. (Fabaceae), and Urtica dioica (Urticaceae)] were chosen as model systems for genotoxicity assessment in a case of metal stressors. Plant samples were collected from two different areas, metal polluted (area around city of Veles, known for its lead and zinc industrial activity in the nearest past) and referent area (without metal exposi-tion, Plackovica Mountain). Element analysis (analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrom-eter (ICP-AES)), DNA extraction (frozen plant samples were used for DNA isolation by using REDExtract-N-Amp Plant PCR Kit (Sigma-Aldrich)) and RAPD-PCR analysis were performed with samples included in this study. Am-plifications were performed in a DNA thermo cycler ac-cording to protocol of Enan, 2006. Seven different primers (with 60-70% GC content) were used. Sequences (5'-3') from Primer 1 to 7 were: Primer 1 - GGTGCGGGAA; Primer 2 - GTTTCGCTCC; Primer 3 - GTAGACCCGT; Primer 4 - AAGAGCCCGT; Primer 5 - AACGCGCAAC; Primer 6 - CCCGTCAGCA; Primer 7 - GGCACTGAGG. All amplifications were repeated twice in order to confirm the reproducible amplification of scored fragments. Only reproducible and clear bands were scored for the construc-tion of the data matrix.Results and discussionRAPD technique was used to quantify DNA sequence changes. Agarose-gel electrophoresis of extracted DNA from all samples, revealed total of 37 bands with different molecular weights ranging from 1250 to 5000 bp. It gener-ated distinctive polymorphism value of 72.97% (27 bands) total in four plant species investigated. Polymorphism in the RAPD profiles is scored as the presence or absence S3 PP 138296Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 295 - 296 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsof DNA bands in comparison to the control. The numer-ical analysis based on the banding pattern obtained from the samples exposed to metals was compared with that of the control sample via hierarchical cluster analysis. RAPD profiles generated by samples exposed to metals were dif-ferent from those obtained using control DNA. Samples which were close to the pollution source (high metal-expo-sition area) showed considerable polymorphism. The diag-nostic analysis (considering band intensity differences or the disappearance and/or appearance of RAPD bands) and the phenetic numerical analysis are important parameters in the RAPD method (Bhaduri and Fulekar, 2015; Gjor-gieva et al., 2012; Zhiyi and Haowen, 2004). Amplifica-tion with primer 1 and primer 2 yielded not enough signif-icant polymorphism, so we find that this primer sequenc-es are not suitable for fingerprinting genome of this four plant species. When amplification is performed with prim-er 3 and 5, the highest number of new bands is obtained (9 and 8 bands, respectively), with exception of primer 5 for T. officinale, where probably there is no suitable se-quence in the genome of this plant for annealing of above mentioned primer. The dendrogram constructed using NT-SYSpc programme (Rohlf, 1994) is statistical presenta-tion of the obtained date and showed that there is group-ing in separate clusters of the same plant species collect-ed from two different areas, according to modifications in the RAPD "fingerprints" following metal exposure. In ac-cordance with literature data that considered concentration of 40 mg L-1 of lead and 30 mg L-1 of cadmium (Aydin et al., 2013; Aydin et al., 2015) as the point of maximum appearance and disappearance of new bands in RAPD as-say, we assume that high metal content in all samples from Veles area, determined in present study, was directly in-volved in DNA damage detected which can lead to initia-tion of mutations.ConclusionRAPD assay is a valuable tool to evaluate the effects of toxicants on organisms under optimized conditions and for genotoxicity studies. RAPD markers can be used as di-agnostic markers. In this regard, induction of DNA band changes with one kind of a stressor (found in areas with metal pollution) might provide evidence of its genotoxic potential.
