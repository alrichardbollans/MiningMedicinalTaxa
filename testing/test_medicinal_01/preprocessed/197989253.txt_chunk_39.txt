Nutrient profi les and their conditions of use shall be updated to take into account relevant scientifi c 1144 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, preamble 11.1145 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, preamble 12.1146 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 4(1).1147 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 4(1).-208-developments, after consultation with interested parties, in particular food business operators and consumer groups.1148It is not yet clear how many different nutrition profi les will be created. According to a DG Sanco representative, a single set of profi les may be too rigid but on the other hand, an excessive number of food categories could be rather unmanageable. A solution might lie in combining an overall nutrient profi le with derogations, adjustments and exemptions for a limited number of categories of foods or individual foods. These could be identifi ed by taking account of Article 4(1): "(b) the role and importance of the food [...] and the contribution to the diet [...] (c) [...] the presence of nutrients that have been scientifi cally recognised as having an effect on health. "1149According to a German government agency, there is no need to elaborate nutrient profi les for food categories that only include primary agricultural products (e.g. fi sh, meat, fruit or vegetables)1150. The Commission seems to share this view, as a Commission representative suggests setting profi les for the following food categories:Vegetab le oils1) Spreadable fats2) Dairy products3) Cereal products (bread, breakfast cereals)4) Fruit products5) Other foods6) 1151.It might be necessary to set up separate categories also for ready meals (including soups, pizza etc. ), beverages (non-alcoholic), and desserts, snacks and sweets.1152Nutrient profi les include several diffi cult questions: The balance of nutrients in the whole diet must be taken into account. A benefi cial nutrient such as calcium or fi bre might balance the effect of a fat or a sugar. There is a lack in uniformity regarding portion sizes, and diets vary among European food cultures. Grouping nutrients as 'good' or 'bad' is too straightforward. 1148 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 4(1).1149 Didion 2007. 1150 Bundesinstitut fur Risikobewertung: Nutrient Profi les. The Precondition for Health Claims. Updated Position Paper 12 March 2007. 1151 Didion 2007.1152 The Finnish "Report on health claims used in marketing of foodstuffs in Finland", page 22, classifi es food products into the following 12 categories:Milk and milk products1) Cheese and cheese-like products2) Meat, poultry, eggs, charcuterie products3) Fish and fi sh products4) Cereal products5) Vegetables, fruits and berries6) Ready meals7) Vegetable oils8) Spreadable oils9) Beverages10) Desserts, snacks and sweets11) Others.12) -209-For example all trans-fatty acids are not harmful. The nutrient profi les established by the Commission will undoubtedly be controversial and raise criticism. Nutrient profi les and their conditions of use shall be updated to take into account relevant scientifi c developments in accordance with the Committee procedure and after consultation of interested parties, in particular food business operators and consumer groups1153.Previously, claims have been allowed if they are true. Now the food must additionally be healthy as a whole. Evaluating the food as a whole takes the prohibition of misleading advertising to a new level. Now the consumer does not have to weigh the benefi t of the claim to some unhealthy features of the food. Conversely, the consumer cannot use health claims as guidance on which unhealthy product to choose. The nutrient profi le approach is more paternalistic than the previous system, but is justifi ed because of the diffi culties in evaluating the issues of nutrition.In making up the profi les, some products will end up being 'bad' in a sense that nothing good can be said about them. The prohibition to make claims might sound unfair to producers of various products, such as producers of functional confectionary. It seems that public health concerns overweigh freedom of speech. Unhealthy food producers are becoming legally equated with tobacco and alcohol producers. Tobacco and alcohol are legal products. Still, marketers have very limited space: there are restrictions, limitations, and obligations. Tobacco and alcohol companies have no real right to freely sell their products, which is no longer questioned.5.3.3.3.2 The DerogationBy way of derogation from the rule described above, nutrition claims (it is important to notice that the exception does not apply to health claims):referring to "(a) the reduction of fat, saturated fatty acids, trans-fatty acids, sugars and salt/sodium shall be allowed without reference to a profi le for the specifi c nutrient/s for which the claim is made, ... shall be allowed, where (b) a single nutrient exceeds the nutrient profi le provided that a statement about the specifi c nutrient appears in close proximity to, on the same side and with the same prominence as the claim. This statement shall read as follows: "High [the name of the nutrient exceeding the nutrient profi le] content"1154.Point (a) means that one can claim 'reduced amount of harmful nutrient' even if the product does not fi t the profi le.Point (b) is more controversial. It means that if a nutrient profi le, for example, includes limits for fat, salt, and sugar, and the product exceeds one of the three limits, it can still bear nutrition claims, for example, "low-fat" or "high in fi bre".Prior to Parliament's second reading vote in May 2006, "a slight amendment to Article 4 was agreed between Council and Parliament, whereby a nutrition claim will still be permitted if only one nutrient (e.g. salt, sugar or fat) exceeds the limit of the nutritional profi le"1155. This 1153 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 4(1).1154 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 4(2).1155 European Commission Press release IP/06/625, 16/05/2006.-210-"slight amendment" is a political compromise and the requirement for a healthy nutritional profi le is not fully realised. The preambles of the Regulation do not explain the derogation. The derogation would sound strange to a nutritional scientist, as it seems to dilute the whole idea of only healthy products having claims. Why draw up a nutritional profi le, if the product does not have to fi t that profi le? The amendment saved a lot of products: for instance, a ready-made meal that has a lot of saturated fats but no salt or sugar might be able to bear claims relating to the low amounts of salt and sugar. Of course, the derogation was created precisely for this reason: to allow important product groups to derogate. For a scientist, legislation creates artifi cial boundaries. For a politician, legislation creates necessary compromises.The derogation led to the need to indicate the remaining unhealthy ingredient. According to the agreed rule, the high level of the substance exceeding the nutritional profi le limit must be clearly marked on the label, close to and with the same prominence as the claim. This leads to unclear messages on labels, for example, a product might have a claim "low fat" next to the text "high in sugar". How will a consumer react? After reading the regulation carefully, he would be able to determine that the product is high in sugar but low in fat and also low in other harmful nutrients. But the consumer will not be able to determine whether the excess amount of sugar makes the product unhealthy as a whole.In practice, the derogation creates a situation where there are in practice alternative nutritional profi les which the product must fulfi ll. These alternatives are certainly not equivalent according to nutritional science. For example, popcorn with salt and popcorn with sugar are not equivalent although they both have one ingredient that is not healthy. On the other hand, this simplistic and unscientifi c thinking is close to the procedures that a consumer may consider: "today I avoid sugar, tomorrow I avoid salt". The consumer does not know exactly how each dietary change effects her health, but she might want to take steps in the right direction by purchasing a product that "does something right".Concerning nutrition claims, the message given to the food industry is that as long as they put something good in the food products, products are OK. It would have been a lot stricter - and clearer - if they had to make the products healthy as a whole before they could attach any nutrition claims to them.5.3.3.4 Nutrition ClaimsAccording to European defi nition," nutrition claim" means any claim, which states, suggests or implies that a food has particular benefi cial nutritional properties due to:the energy (calorifi c value) it(a) provides;(i) provides at a reduced or increased rate; or(ii) does not provide; and/or(iii) the nutrients or other substances it(b) contains;(i) contains in reduced or increased proportions; or(ii) does not contain(iii) 1156.1156 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 2(2)(4).-211-The new Regulation 1924/2006/EC lays down strict conditions for the use of nutritional claims such as "low fat", "high fi bre" or "reduced sugar". Nutrition claims shall only be permitted if they are listed in the Annex and are in conformity with the conditions set out in the Regulation. Amendments to the Annex shall be adopted in accordance with the committee procedure and, where appropriate, after consulting the EFSA.1157The following nutrition claims and the conditions for their use are listed in the Annex:"low calorie" - 1158," reduced calorie" - 1159,"calorie-free" - 1160,"low fat" - 1161,"fat-free" - 1162,"low saturated fat" - 1163,"saturated fat-free" - 1164,"low sugars" - 1165,"sugar-free" - 1166,1157 Regulation 1924/2006/EC, Article 8.1158 "A claim that a food is low in calorie, and any claim likely to have the same meaning for the consumer, may only be made where the product does not contain more than 40 kcal (170 kJ)/100 g for solids or more than 20 kcal (80 kJ)/100 ml for liquids.

This means there must be suffi cient quantities of the nutrient present to make a benefi cial effect. For vitamins and minerals the conditions of the claim "source of" shall apply.-213-"increased [name of the nutrient]" - 1178, "reduced [name of the nutrient]" - 1179,"light/lite" - 1180, "naturally/natural" - 1181.The claim "as much as" is not in the Annex of the Regulation and is consequently not allowed. Neither is the claim "super light".1182The comparative nutrition claims listed in the annex are the following: "increased [name of the nutrient]", "reduced [name of the nutrient]", " reduce calorie" and "light". With regard to comparative nutrition claims, a comparison may only be made between foods of the same category, taking into consideration a range of foods of that category1183.
