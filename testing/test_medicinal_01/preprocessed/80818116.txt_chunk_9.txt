Haloperi-dol and fluphenazine were available also as long-acting so-lutions for injection. The purchased antipsychotics totaled 3.36 million in 2006 and increased to 4.78 million in 2012. This is a 42% an increase of total antipsychotic use. Of all antipsychot-ics, the amount of purchased typical antipsychotics de-clined gradually from 1.2 million in 2006 to 1 million dos-age forms in 2012. The amount of atypical antipsychotics increased from 1.7 million in 2006 to 3.7 million in 2012 (more than doubled). Atypical antipsychotics constituted 60% and 78% of the total amount of purchased antipsy-chotics in 2006 and 2012, respectively. Quantity of Lithi-um more than doubled from 362 thousand in 2006 to 729 thousand in 2008. Numbers of DDDs were estimated for each antipsy-chotic. Among typical antipsychotics, haloperidol had the highest number of DDDs /day/ 100 000 inhabitants with 40 DDDs in 2006 and rose to 58.8 DDDs in 2012. Chlor-promazine came second behind haloperidol. Other typical antipsychotics use such as fluphenazine, levomepromazine and thioridazine also decreased during 2006-2012. Lithi-um's number of DDDs increased from 11.5 to 21.9 during the study period. Among atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine had the greatest increase in use, with a number of DDDs of 18.9 in 2006 and 127 DDDs in 2012. Olanzapine in 2012 had the greatest number of DDDs than any other antipsychotic dur-ing the entire 2006-2012 period. Clozapine was among the drugs with the highest number of DDDs during the study period with 32.3 DDDs in 2006 and 57.2 DDDs in 2012. The number of DDDs for risperidone increased also from 28.7 to 46.9 during 2006 - 2012. Number of DDDs for Lith-ium also doubled during the study period, from 11.5-21.9.Total reimbursement costs for antipsychotics equaled 252 million ALL in 2006 and 293 million in 2012 (lith-ium not included). In 2006, the reimbursement costs in-curred by atypical and typical antipsychotics were 230 mil-lion ALL (91% of total reimbursement costs) and 22 mil-lion ALL, respectively. In 2012, the reimbursement costs incurred by atypical and typical antipsychotics were 234 million ALL (80% of the total reimbursement costs) and 59 million ALL, respectively. The reimbursement costs for Lithium were 2.6 million ALL in 2006, and increased to 7.9 million ALL in 2012, a threefold increase during 2006-2012.For the entire study period, the mean price per typical antipsychotic paid by the patient ranged from 87-105 ALL. This price was on average 5% - 9% of the total typical an-tipsychotic cost. The mean price per atypical antipsychot-ic paid by the patient ranged from 815 - 1385 ALL, which on average constituted 11-26% of the atypical antipsychot-ic total cost during the study period. No distinct trend was noticed for patient costs. ConclusionDuring 2006-2012 there was a 42% increase of total antipsychotic use. While the amount of typical antipsy-chotics declined, the amount of atypical antipsychotics more than doubled from 2006 to 2012. Among typical anti-psychotics, haloperidol had the highest number of DDDs /day/ 100 000 inhabitants, which showed an increase during the study period. Among atypical antipsychotics, olanzap-ine had the greatest increase in use; its number of DDDs during the study period increased seven-fold. Clozapine was among the atypical drugs with the highest number of DDDs. Total reimbursement costs increased from 2006 to 2012. There was an increase in the costs of both typical and atypical antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics accounted for the majority of reimbursement costs for antipsychotics. Notable is the increase of 2.7 fold of typical antipsychot-ics reimbursement costs, despite the fact that their use has not changed significantly over the same period. For the en-tire study period, the mean price per atypical antipsychotic paid by the patient was 10 times higher than the mean price of typical antipsychotics.ReferencesFreudenreich, O., Goff, D.C., 2010.

Medication is the most frequent intervention within healthcare systems worldwide. Achieving the best possible outcome of medication for the quality of life of patients should be the primary aim of all health profession-als involved in the medication chain, as well as careers and patients depending on their abilities and capacities. Phar-maceutical care is a quality philosophy and working meth-od for professionals within the medication chain. It is in-dispensable for helping to improve the good and safe use of medicines, thus realizing the full potential of medicines available on the market to achieve the best possible out-come in patients as observed (Cousins et al., 2012).In the years that have passed since we opened our pharmacy in 2007, we managed to establish work policies while dealing with numerous problems. Even from the be-ginning, the patients themselves were in the focus of our work due to the fact that it was our firm belief that being professional and honest with our patients will only bring positive feedback on the long run.In a close collaboration with other professional healthcare personnel, especially the doctors, we created an important bond that has had only positive effects on our patients. Creating trust and a strong belief in our principles was one of the biggest benefits during the first couple of years. Of course, the trust is something we built very care-fully and it is long-lasting, and it has to be maintained irre-spective of everything. Throughout the years, as we grew, our main ob-jective was focused on the well-being of the patients. We started with patients with diabetes, making them aware of the importance of eating properly and managing the thera-py. We always reminded them how to use and take insulin, or when to take their tablets.We continued with, perhaps, the most struggling patients - the ones with cancers. We tried to bring some light and positive thinking and, of course, help them with advice on how to improve their immune system and their overall health condition. The next group of patients with a great need of extra care was the patients with high blood pressure. We are well trained to organize and recognize any drug inter-actions for this group of patients. Informing them which tablets to drink in the morning and which during the day was the first thing we did for them. Emphasizing the im-portance of proper dieting and physical activity was the second thing we did, and instructing them how to proper-ly measure their blood pressure was the third. At the end of the day, all of them were happy and pleased with the infor-mation and the care they got in our pharmacy.Materials and methodsThe study was conducted by observation of the patient's habits during the months of January to June ev-ery year, starting from 2007 to 2014. As shown in another study (Nikolic et al., 2014) 29.09% of patients visit phar-macy seeking advice for minor health problems and 83.5% of patients come to the pharmacy at least once per month. 65% patients said that in case of minor ailments, they con-sult pharmacist first. Having this in mind, we took in consideration the number of daily visits by our patients and the time need-ed for them to be served and answered any questions. The objective was that one patient shouldn't wait more than 5 minutes inside the pharmacy.S1 PP 1954Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 53 - 54 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsNext objective was the total revenue for every fiscal year and the differences between consecutive years in rise of the income parallel to the rise of the number of patients.Results and discussionFor the first 6 months, we reached an average of 35-40 visits by patients a day. Every patient was treated with great care and we started the implementation of the "Good Pharmaceutical Practice" from the first to the last patient. Very soon, patients started to recognize and appreciate our hard work and constant care. In the next 3 years we reached an average of 80-90 visits per day, in other words, we dou-bled the frequency of patients visiting and buying different products in our pharmacy. In 2010 we needed more staff, so we hired our fist pharmaceutical technician. We spent two mounts in train-ing with her so that she could reach out to the patients in the same manner we did. Having a third person working was a big relief for us because we could concentrate more on the patients and on the interaction - "pharmacist-pa-tient". On the long run this brought us more work, mean-ing more patients. The quality of the service was improved, the waiting period was shortened much more and more pa-tients were visiting our pharmacy. We finished 2010 with an increase in total revenue for 11.6% in comparison to 2009. Compared to 2010, our total revenue in 2011 and 2012 increased 12% and 23% respectively.We continued with the same trend in 2013. By reach-ing an average number of 140 visits per day we stayed in line with our goal to become one of the most appreciat-ed and trusted pharmacies in our city. Working in pairs we maintained the waiting time under 4 minutes per patient. In 2014 we averaged 165 visits per day, our goal was to main-tain the core stability of our pharmacy and that has always been the patients.ConclusionNow, in 2016, having gained a lot of experience, we are ready for challenges. In the middle of this year we plan to create support groups. Those groups should be consisted of struggling patients with the same or similar health con-ditions that make their life seem unbearable. The concept of support groups is fairly unknown in our city, or maybe even in our country, so we are hoping to bring again some new light in the difficult life of the high-risk patients. We plan to organize meetings with small groups of patients ev-ery week. They can share within their own experiences and struggles within the group. By sharing important informa-tion they can only help others. This concept, we believe, can have only positive impact in our patients' lives. We strongly believe that interacting and evolving in some social aspects of people's lives is the future of the modern pharmacist. The continued education and the con-stant striving for positive changes are our guidelines for the future.To conclude, providing a high-quality care for our pa-tients and constantly improving their quality of life is a work policy that not only generates immensely satisfied patients, but also generates higher income, which is a result of the increasing number of patients seeking the best possi-ble care, which we, as health workers, constantly provide.

The exclusivity is granted, in most legal systems, upon a registration of the relevant industrial property right in an administrative procedure. By granting industrial property rights, competent authorities of the state offer certain monopoly which, construed in terms of different legal theories (Dabovic-Anastasovska and Pepeljugoski, 2012), is limited. Legally speaking, the term of the exclusivity granted is limited and, after its expiry, the relevant industrial property right lapses and enters the so called public domain. Such is the case also with patents as industrial property rights. The term of protection is 20 years from the filling of the application for protection (Article 33 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter: the TRIPS)). The Republic of Macedonia is a party to the TRIPS and this requirement is implemented by national legislation (Article 74(1) of the Industrial Property Law (hereinafter: the IPL)).Materials and methodsThe IPL recognizes the granting of patents for inventions of drugs, in terms of Article 27(1) of the TRIPS. When a patent for an invention of a drug is granted, its holder is authorized to undertake certain exclusive entitlements and to claim such exclusivity relating to third parties (Article 28 of the TRIPS and Article 89 of the IPL). On the other hand, said exclusivity is not absolute bearing in mind that applicable law may reserve certain entitlements only until the public interest becomes affected. Therefore, the exclusivity granted is limited by applicable law. In terms of Article 30 of the TRIPS, its Members may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties. When patents for inventions of drugs are concerned, third parties interests are converged in terms of the interest of public health.Article 91(2) of the IPL provides that the exclusive entitlements of the patent holder in terms of the IPL shall not relate to the undertaking activities for research and development of the subject matter of the protected invention, in particular: manufacture, use, offer for sale, export or import of the protected invention, including also the activities for obtaining approval for placing on the market of drugs for human and veterinary medicine or products for protection of plants. This is the case of the so called "Bolar clause", introduced in terms of the TRIPS (Neethu, 2015), which allows for fast introduction of a generic drug after the patent term by permitting technical preparation for registration of the same drug from an alternative source before the patent has expired (Dukes, 2006). Its brooder acceptance came after the 1984 Hatch-Waxman Act (35 U.S. Code SS 271(e) (1)) was adopted in the US following the decision in Roche Products v. Bolar Pharmaceutical 733 F.2d 858 (Fed. Cir. 1984) where the court held that Bolar's acts (obtaining the active ingredient from a foreign manufacturer and beginning studies for filing an application for a generic drug before the Food S1 PP 2056Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 55 - 56 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsand Drug Administration) constitute an infringement of Roche's patent (and not an exception in terms of an experimental use) which had not lapsed yet (Haracoglou, 2008; Kretzschmar, 2014).
