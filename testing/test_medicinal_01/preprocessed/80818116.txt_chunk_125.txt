Monoterpenes were iden-tified as main compounds (83.27%) with linalool acetate (19.89%), carvacrol (13.84%) and linalool (10.33%) as predominat constituents. Large amounts of linalool (28.1-35.5%) were also found in essential oils of the Macedo-nian T. jankae (Baba mountain) (Kulevanova et al., 1998).Oxygenated monoterpens (75.01%) were dominated fraction in the essential oil of T. longicaulis. As main com-pounds were detected alcohols linalool (37.69%) and ge-raniol (17.73%) followed by other monoterpenes such as: b-myrcene (5.87%), terpinen-4-ol (4.79%) and cis-sabi-nene hydrate (4.18%). The chemical profile of two samples of T. moesia-cus (Brezovica and Prvale) was characterised with gerani-ol (13.82% and 13.12%, respectively) and linalool (6.86% and 10.61%, respectively). The phenolic compound thy-mol was determined in higher percent (13.97-19.02%) in the oil sample from Brezovica whereas carvacrol (22.33%) was dominated in the sample from Prevale. These four compounds represented 52.32-53.47% of total oils.Sesquiterpens were predominant in the essential oil of T. pannonicus (72.25%) with germacrene D (17.98%) as main constituent. Larger amount of germacrene D (12.12%) was found in the oil samples of T. pannonicus from Romania, but the most abundant component in this oil was a-terpinyl acetate (48.83%) (Boz et al., 2011).47 compounds were identified in one essential oil sam-ple from T. pulegioides from Vata (South Kosovo), repre-senting 99.29% of the oil. The oxygenated monoterpenes thymol (33.48%) and geraniol (23.36%) were the main constituents. Large amounts of g-terpinene (10.49%) were also found. These three constituents represented 67.33% of the total oil. The quantitative variability of linalool (2.23-30.79%) was also noticed in three samples of T. tosevii followed by different percentages of thymol (1.23-5.41%) and carvacrol (2.29-40.34%), as well as linalool acetate (0.48-22.33%). Variability in the essential oil composition of T. tosevii was previously reported by Kulevanova et al. (1996) for the samples from Macedonia. The content of some important constituents of the oil varied in broad ranges such as 7.88-20.92%, 0.24-21.79%, 0.58-30.08% and 0.05-26.87% for linalool, geraniol, thymol and carvacrol, respectively (Ku-levanova et al., 1996).The alcohol linalool (30.78%) was determine as main constituent in the oil of Thymus tosevii ssp. substriatus fol-lowed by high quantities of linalool acetate (21.77%) and thymol (13.21%).ConclusionChemical composition of essential oils of eight Thy-mus species from Kosovo had showed great variability. As the essential oils of Thymus are valuable because of some monoterpene phenols and alcohols (thymol, linalool, gera-niol), the most of the species (T. pulegioides, T. tosevii, T. tosevii ssp. substriatus, T. moesiacus, T. jankae and T. lon-gicaulis) from Kosovo represent biological source of es-sential oil that could be use for exploitation and further uti-lization. On the other hand T. balcanus and T. pannonicus can be exploited for isolation of the sesquiterpene com-pounds, germacrene D and E-caryophyllene, which were predominant constituents in the oils of these species.

Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* gorde.gestakovska@gmail.comIntroductionNowadays, the use of cannabis and its legalization for medical use has become a worldwide trend, due to his significant pharmacological effects. Due to the legal con-straints on the possession and use of C. sativa, relatively little research on the medicinal qualities of this plant has been conducted. Ben Amar (2006) has recently shown that, the therapeutic applications of cannabis and its derivatives have been studied by various world bodies, including the Scientific Committee of the House of Lords in Great Brit-ain, the Institute of Medicine in the United States and the Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs in Canada. Since there is a lack of valuable and reliable information about the routes of cannabis administration and dosage, in this review, we have done overview of six different ways of medical cannabis administration, their risks and benefits. SmokingSmoking cannabis produces the most immediate relief and permits the most refined control of the dosage. When cannabis is smoked, the active ingredients are deposited di-rectly into the blood stream, after being absorbed through the mucus membrane of the lung. Whereas the central ner-vous system and physiological effects occur within min-utes by the smoking route or by vaporization, these effects proceed on a time scale of hours in the case of oral inges-tion. Determining correct dosage is easier with smoked can-nabis, since the effects are usually felt within 30-60 sec. and develop fully within 5-15 min. The effects may last from 30 min. to 3 h. Using natural-based chemical free rolling papers, such as those derived from hemp or rice is recommended for health reasons and to avoid using tree products. Although medical marijuana is nontoxic, smoking it can be hazard-ous over the long term, because toxic compounds are cre-ated in the combustion process. The World Health Organi-zation (WHO) suggests that a typical marijuana cigarette (joint) contains between 0.5 g and 1.0 g of cannabis (av-erage 0.75 g). Commercially available strains of cannabis can contain up to 30% THC. An average joint of a 10% THC cannabis strain would contain 75 mg of THC (0.75 g x 10% THC content).Vaporizing Vaporizers can be used as a smokeless alternative. Cannabis vaporizers are designed to let users inhale ac-tive cannabinoids while avoiding smoke. Vaporizers work by heating the cannabis just below the point of combus-tion, the point at which smoke is produced. When the can-nabis is properly heated, THC and other cannabinoids are emitted in the form of a vapor. This markedly reduces the amount of irritating particulate materials that get inhaled, resulting in much less inflammation and damage to the lin-ing of the lungs. Many patients who find smoked cannabis highly irritating, report effective relief inhaling through va-porizers. Dose is through self titration (gradually adjusting the dose of medicine, until the desired effect is achieved).Using vaporizers, typically between 50 mg and 500 mg of dried marijuana is used at once. Using a 10% THC strain would mean that between 5 mg and 50 mg of THC would be contained in this dose.Sublingual deliveryThe sublingual (under the tongue) or oro-mucosal (in the oral cavity) delivery method of an oil or tincture pro-S5 PP 246516Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 515 - 516 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsvides another rapid onset of action as the medication is readily absorbed into the blood system. Tinctures are usual-ly prepared in a base of alcohol, oil or glycerol. Many con-centrated tinctures are taken by dropper under the tongue, and within a few minutes the patient will feel the effects. Ef-fects of tinctures are usually felt within 5 min. up to 1 h and last about 4 h. It is recommended to start with about 3 drops of tincture, and wait an hour before increasing the dosage incrementally and as necessary. Other tinctures may be in a spray container and sprayed in the mouth to be absorbed in the oral cavity and thence into the bloodstream. The sub-lingual spray is a compromise between the inhaled and oral routes: compared to the oral administration, it reduces the first-pass metabolism, thus increasing the bioavailability of the drug and allowing a greater dose-titration.Oral ingestionOral administration results in a slower onset of action, lower peak blood levels of cannabinoids and a longer du-ration of pharmacodynamic effects, compared to smoking. Taking cannabis by mouth in pill form or swallowed as a liquid, have both benefits and drawbacks. Since the canna-binoids are fat-soluble, their absorption through the gut is slower and less predictable, being dependent upon the indi-vidual's metabolism as well as the contents of the stomach. The onset of action may take as long as 30 min. to an hour, making it more difficult to determine an effective dose, especially for the novice patient. In addition, when taken orally, the medication gets metabolized through the liver before getting into the bloodstream. The liver converts the THC to another chemical, called 11-hydroxy-THC which is more psychoactive than THC, and so the effects will be different than if inhaled or taken sublingually. The advan-tage of the oral route is that it will last much longer, so a patient does not have to medicate as frequently. This can be helpful for glaucoma patients who are trying to maintain a lower intraocular pressure (Mathre, 2015).Topical applicationCannabis can be applied externally as a topical oint-ment, lotion, or poultice, and may be used in the treatment of skin inflammations, arthritis or muscle pains. The goal is for the medication to be absorbed at the specific location being treated. Although it is unclear how well the cannabi-noids are absorbed through the skin, the more soluble ter-penoids and flavonoids also have anti-inflammatory prop-erties that can be effective.Rectal administrationRectal administration of marijuana has many advan-tages. In addition to be a viable option for patients who can't ingest or inhale cannabis, cannabis suppositories are the best choice. Cannabis suppositories are made either cannabis-infused coconut oil or cocoa butter infused with FECO oil (full infused cannabis oil). Avoiding the gastro-intestinal tract, prevents metabolism by the stomach and liver, which breaks down the many different cannabinoids into their constituent parts (including THC), and allows the active constituents to reach the blood in much higher con-centrations.50% of THC is usually transformed into its more psychoactive form, 11-Hydroxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocan-nabinol, when taken orally. Rectal administration avoids these effects, whilst allowing a higher proportion of THC to reach the bloodstream. While D9-THC itself is not ab-sorbed through the rectal route, the pro-drug D9-THC-hemisuccinate is absorbed; this fact, combined with de-creased first-pass metabolism through the rectal route, re-sults in a higher bioavailability of D9-THC by the rectal route (52-61%) than by the oral route. In humans, rec-tal doses of 2.5-5.0 mg of the hemisuccinate ester of D9-THC were associated with peak plasma levels of D9-THC ranging between 1.1 and 4.1 ng/mL within 2-8 h, and peak plasma levels of carboxy-D9-THC ranging between 6.1-42.0 ng/mL within 1-8 h after administration (Abramov-ici, 2013).ConclusionIt is important to remember that in addition to dif-ferences in the amount of cannabis used with the various routes of administration, each on is different with respect to the percentage of THC/ other cannabinoids that it deliv-ers to the system and the timing of that delivery. For each pathology, it remains to be determined what type of canna-binoid and what route of administration are the most suit-able to maximize the beneficial effects of each preparation and minimize the incidence of undesirable reactions. To maximize the benefits (efficacy) and reduce the undesir-able effects (toxicity), new formulations for administering and delivering cannabinoids are currently under investiga-tion.ReferencesAbramovici, H., 2013.

Close collaboration with physicians, nurses and oth-er healthcare providers in interdisciplinary teams is vital.Many studies have evaluated the role of a clinical pharmacist and the impact of clinical pharmacy services in different patient groups in both outpatient environments (community pharmacies and ambulatory clinics) and in-patient facilities (teaching hospitals and nursing homes), (Anderson and Schumock, 2009; Gallagher et al., 2014; Rotta et al., 2015) and in various specialty settings (e.g. emergency department) (Davis et al., 2016; Lada and Del-gado, 2007). Clinical pharmacy interventions - clinical and economic benefitsOne of the main activities of clinical pharmacists are clinical interventions and they are described in several ways (Alderman and Farmer, 2001; Kjeldsen et al., 2014; Westerlund and Marklund, 2009). Most literature reviews conclude that clinical pharmacy interventions contribute to improve patient outcomes and cost savings focusing on specific clinical benefits (e.g. reduced adverse drug ef-fects and medication errors, enhanced medication adher-ence, appropriate use of medications and prescriptions) and economic benefits (e.g. cost-effectiveness) (Anderson and Schumock, 2009; Gallagher et al., 2014; Touchette et al., 2014). However, studies differ regarding their method-ology and outcomes measures, and the description of phar-macist interventions and their implementation are incon-sistent (De Rijdt, 2008; Rotta et al., 2015).Pharmacy students - clinical contributionsAcademia shapes the culture of clinical pharmacy by training future professionals, e.g. in experiential practice rotations (Rathbun et al., 2012).
