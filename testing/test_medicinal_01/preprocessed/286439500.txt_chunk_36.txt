Nonetheless, although an in vitro antioxidant potentialof urolithin A was relatively low in comparison with otherurolithins, its plasma concentrations was the highest amongthem (Bialonska et al., 2009). In a subsequent study, urolithinA glucuronide inhibited adhesion of monocytes to endothelialcells in the micromolar range (5-15uM), suggesting that thebeneficial effects of pomegranate intake on the vasculaturemight be partly mediated by urolithin A glucuronide (Gimenez-Bastida et al., 2012). In addition, a recent in vitro study showedpotent anti-atherogenic properties of ellagic acid and someurolithins (Mele et al., 2016). All these compounds reducedthe adhesion of THP-1 derived macrophages to HUVECsand diminished secretion of soluble vascular cell adhesionmolecule-1 (VCAM-1) and inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6)(Mele et al., 2016). In a study utilizing cultured human arteryendothelial cells, urolithin A attenuated endothelial dysfunctioninduced by oxLDL (Han et al., 2016). These effects werepartly mediated by counteracting eNOS-dependent decreasein NO production (Han et al., 2016). In addition, urolithinA reduced the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), upon adhesion of THP-1 cells to the endothelial cells.Urolithin A also suppressed the expression of tumor necrosisfactor-a (TNF-a), IL-6 and endothelin-1, increased PPAR-g mRNA expression, and downregulated phosphorylation ofthe extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)(Han et al., 2016). In another study, urolithin A inhibitedheme peroxidases [myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoperoxidase(LPO)] more effectively than its parent compound ellagic acid(Saha et al., 2016). Animal experiments using C57BL/6 micerevealed potent anti-inflammatory properties of urolithin A,as it efficiently reduced phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced mouse ear edema formation (Saha et al., 2016).Urolithin A also lessened myocardial ischemia/reperfusioninjury and reduced myocardial infarct size in mice via thephosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway (Tang et al.,2017).Altogether, the studies presented above pointed to beneficialvascular effects of urolithins and especially metabolite urolithinA. Additional information on metabolic fate and healtheffects of ellagitanins and urolithins can be found in severalrecent reviews (Garcia-Munoz and Vaillant, 2014; Lipinskaet al., 2014; Landete et al., 2016; Tomas-Barberan et al.,2017).In addition to the above presented effects of hydrolyzabletannins (ellagitannins and gallotannins), their derivativeellagic acid, or their common metabolites urolithins, butalso other substances were shown to contribute to beneficialeffects of pomegranate products. These include (poly)phenoliccompounds anthocyanins (Alighourchi et al., 2008; Fischeret al., 2011a) and flavonoids (Sudheesh and Vijayalakshmi,2005; Ricci et al., 2006), as well as fatty acids (Kaufman andWiesman, 2007). For example, anthocyanins exhibit anti-inflammatory activities (Vendrame and Klimis-Zacas, 2015).Flavonoid naringin abundantly present in pomegranate juice(Mphahlele et al., 2014) is considered to contribute (togetherFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 54492Wang et al. Vasculoprotective Effects of Pomegranatewith flavonoid naritutin) to the anti-hypertensive effects ofsweetie juice in humans (Reshef et al., 2005). Puninic acidwas shown to ameliorate glucose tolerance and diminishobesity-related inflammation via an activation of PPAR-gand a (Hontecillas et al., 2009). Quercetin present in juice,seed, and peel of pomegranate (Artik, 1998; Borges andCrozier, 2012; Ambigaipalan et al., 2016) is known to mediateendothelium-dependent vasodilatation via stimulation of boththe NO/cyclic guanylyl monophosphate (cGMP) pathway andendothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) (Khooet al., 2010).CLINICAL STUDIES ON POMEGRANATE INTHE CONTEXT OF CARDIOVASCULARDISEASESMany clinical studies investigating the effects of pomegranate inthe context of CVDs were performed in the last two decades.These works profusely demonstrated the vasculoprotectiveproperties of pomegranate products (Table 4). Nevertheless,some of these studies pointed to the fact that when applyingpomegranate for a longer period or in high amounts, certainpossible side effects of such treatment (mainly diarrhea) mightoccur (Paller et al., 2013).In hypertensive patients, daily consumption of pomegranatejuice for 2 weeks reduced the activity of ACE by 36% aswell as diminished systolic blood pressure by 5% (Aviramand Dornfeld, 2001). The same group also reported that along-duration intake of pomegranate juice (for 3 years) bypatients with carotid artery stenosis significantly reduced theirblood pressure, LDL oxidation and common carotid intima-media thickness (Aviram et al., 2004). A 4-week consumptionof pomegranate juice reduced significantly blood pressurein a cohort of 51 healthy women (without significantlychanging serum ACE activity; Lynn et al., 2012). Anotherstudy involving 13 hypersensitive men demonstrated that intakeof pomegranate juice lowered blood pressure (Asgary et al.,2013). However, in these patients the levels of some clinicalparameters, such as serum concentrations of C-reactive protein(CRP), E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and IL-6 remainedunchanged (Asgary et al., 2013). A subsequent study involving 21hypertensive patients showed that consumption of pomegranatejuice significantly reduced systolic as well as diastolic bloodpressure (Asgary et al., 2014). In addition, a double blind,randomized, placebo controlled pilot study revealed that thepomegranate peel hydroalcoholic extract reduced cardiovascularrisk factors in obese women with dyslipidemia (Haghighian et al.,2016).Although a meta-analysis evaluating the effects ofpomegranate consumption on CRP concentrations did notreveal a significant correlation between these parameters(Sahebkar et al., 2016), the effects of pomegranate consumptionon blood pressure regulation in accomplished animal andhuman studies seem to be clinically relevant. In a recent reviewit was concluded that both pomegranate juice and seed oilcan effectively lower blood pressure (Asgary et al., 2017).Another recently accomplished meta-analysis came to thesame conclusions, as intake of pomegranate juice decreasedlevels of systolic blood pressure regardless of the durationand dose of the juice consumed in the evaluated studies,whereas doses more than 240 cc (eight ounces) exhibited aborderline significant effect in reducing of a diastolic bloodpressure (Sahebkar et al., 2017). The authors of this meta-analysis determined a constant benefit of pomegranate juiceintake on blood pressure, which may be considered clinicallyrelevant.

Vasculoprotective Effects of Pomegranatevasculature can be found in some other reviews (Lansky andNewman, 2007; Aviram and Rosenblat, 2013; Hyson, 2015;Zheng et al., 2017). In addition to many described beneficialeffects of pomegranete on endothelial function, pomegranatejuice was also found to enhance the inhibitory effect of NOon vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (Ignarro et al.,2006). This aspect might be clinically relevant and a subjectof further studies, as vascular smooth muscle cell proliferationplays an important role in the development and progression ofatherosclerosis and restenosis (Uhrin et al., 2018; Wang et al.,2018).CONCLUSIONPomegranate, an ancient and highly distinctive fruit, isa rich source of natural bioactive constituents. Variousstudies showed that pomegranate and its products exhibitprotective effects on the cardiovascular system. Thesevasculoprotective effects include diminishing of oxidativestress, positive influencing macrophage-, endothelial cell-,and platelet function, lowering lipid oxidation, reducingblood glucose levels, vasodilatory effects as well as decreasingblood pressure via an inhibition of ACE activity. In lightof the altogether promising outcome of numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies, pomegranate is advocatedto be used as a dietary supplement for prevention andtreatment of cardiovascular diseases, thus representing asupplementary non-pharmacological therapy for cardiovasculardiseases.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSDW, CO, IA-R, SC, JP, PU, and AA wrote the first draft of themanuscript.
