It can be calculated by following equation:F = V u / Vowhere, Vu = final or ultimate volume of sedimentVo = original volume of suspension before settlingResults and discussionIn the formulations with ion - exchange resins, inter-action between the reactive functional group of the poly-acrylic polymer and ionisable active substance mole-cule occurs, until active substance - polymer complex is formed. The reaction is performed under determined pH and temperature values. The complex is insoluble in water and it has no taste, so the bitter taste of the active substance entrapped into the complex is masked. When such complex enters the gastro intestinal fluid, the bond between the active substance and polymer dif-fuses and the molecule of the active substance is released throughout a decomplexation process. The process of re-leasing the active substance is performed very quickly and completely into gastro intestinal fluid so it does not affect the absorption and bioavailability of the active substance. (Bilandi et al., 2014; Sampath Kumar et al., 2012).Different values for the viscosity measurement of all of the experimental trials were obtained, which logically were in correlation with the used percentage of the selected polymer. Values from viscosity measurement for the for-mulations F1, F2 and F3 were 1046 cP, 1234 cP and 1748 cP, as follows. For the trials F4, F5, F6 and F7 were ob-tained the following values 1040 cP, 1730 cP, 738 cP and 1916 cP, respectively.The sedimentation volume can have values ranging from less than 1 to equal or rarely, more than 1. The ulti-mate height of the solid phase after settling depends on the concentration of solid and the particle size. To obtain an ac-ceptable suspension the value of F should be at least 0.9. In the presented study there is no sedimentation after 14 days for all of the seven trials.ConclusionFrom the performed experimental trials it can be con-cluded that increasing the viscosity of the prepared oral suspension with combination of different percentage of xanthan gum, and the same percentage of carboxymeth-ylcellulose sodium and microcrystalline cellulose/car-boxymethylcellulose sodium, results into satisfactory taste masking effect which is more intensively achieved in com-parison with the rest of the experimental trials. The com-plexation process does not give a satisfactory taste mask-ing effect, although these formulations were optimistic and promising. The combination of the three polymeric matrices in the optimized concentration, which results into satisfacto-ry viscosity of the suspension containing nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory active substance, was chosen as a favorite formulation and a candidate to work with in the future tri-als.ReferencesBaig, V., Chavan ,S.B., Begum, S.N., Baseer, M.A., 2014.

Macedonia* tanjakjurkchieva@yahoo.comIntroductionPharmaceutical/cosmetic industry trends are focused toward development of innovative formulations character-ized by controlled release of active ingredient (AI) in or-der to enhance effectiveness and to reduce AI related side/adverse effects. Microsponges (MSPs) incorporated into well known dosage forms represent new generation of highly effective formulations. MSPs efficacy is related to particle size and size distribution, porosity, pore size, surface area, AI en-capsulation efficiency (EE) and release rate. MSPs` char-acteristics (physico-chemical, biopharmaceutical) influ-encing their efficacy might be tailored using certain prep-aration technique, as well as formulation and process pa-rameters. Effect of formulation variables upon MSPs` EE is going to be presented in this review. Quasi-emulsion sol-vent diffusion technique was most commonly used meth-od for MSPs preparation, while drug to polymer ratio and composition of internal and outer (external) phase were identified as significant formulation variables that influ-enced EE.Influence of drug to polymer ratioEE of Ethyl cellulose (EC) or Eudragit RS100 (ERS100) based MSPs loaded with fluconazole (Abdel-malak and El-Menshave, 2012), was in a range of ~15 to 90% depending from the variables studied. Results from their study pointed that increased polymer quantity result-ed with higher EE (~45% vs 55% for 1:1 and 1:2 drug to polymer ratio (DPr), respectively). According to authors the findings might be related to the fact that higher polymer amount would result with increased viscosity of internal organic phase (IOP), thus reducing drug molecule diffu-sion into the external phase (EP) or simply higher amount of polymer encapsulated more drug molecules. Contrary, studies related to ERS100 MSPs loaded with diclofenac diethylamine (DPr 1:1 to 1:6) (Osmani et al., 2015a) or domperidone (DPr 1:1 to 1:5) (Osmani et al., 2015b) showed opposite trend. Determined diclofenac di-ethylamine EE values ranged ~10% for DPr 1:6 to 48% for DPr 1:1 (Osmani et al., 2015a), while domperidone EE were ~73% (DPr 1:5) to 92% (DPr 1:1). Similar were the findings for benzoil peroxide EC MSPs (Jelvehgari et al., 2006) prepared with DPr of 1:1 to 13:1 characterized by EE of 70-98%, whereas probably higher drug quantity would result with increased EE as more drug molecules per polymer unit are available.Studies of Comoglu at al. (2003), Orlu et al. (2006) and (D'souza and More, 2008) related to EE of ERS100 MSPs loaded with ketoprofen (DPr 1:1 to 11:1, EE ~92-96%), flurbiprofen (DPr 3:1 to 5:1, EE ~96-97%) and fluo-cinolone acetonide (DPr 1:1 to 13:1, EE ~87-94%) accord-ingly, indicated that EE was not much affected by DPr. Studies of Arya and Pathak (2014) and Srivastava et al. (2012) associated to ERS100/EC and ERS100 MSPs load-ed with curcumin and meloxicam, respectively, were con-ducted using experimental design studies. EE were ~80-93% for curcumin ERS100/EC MSPs and ~71-99% for meloxicam ERS100 MSPs. Derived correlations between EE and studied variables - EC amount (300-900mg) in the IOP and Polyvinil alcochol (PVA) (0.5-1.5% w/v) in the EP (Arya and Pathak, 2014) and volume of organic media - di-chloromethane (DCM)(5-7 ml) and ERS100 content (400-S4 PP 204430Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 429 - 430 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentations1200 mg) in DCM (Srivastava et al., 2012) pointed to the positive influence of polymer quantity, although later noti-fied that wasn`t statisticaly significant as it was expected. However, influence of interactions` factors upon EE was also identified. Similar findings were observed in the study of Gupta et al. (2015) where 5-fluorouracil ERS100 MSPs were prepared using different polymer quantity (400-1200 mg) and IOP volumes (6-8 ml) consisted of ethanol:DCM mixture (7:3) (EE ~36-61%) as well as in the study of Pawar at al. (2015) related to oxybenzone EC MSPs pre-pared with DPr 1:1 to 1:3 and DCM - 3-5 ml (EE ~90-99%).Influence of organic phase Influence of solvent type (ethanol, methylen chloride) upon MSPs` EE was investigated by Abdelmalak and El-Menshave (2012) where determined EE indicated that eth-anol was solvent of choice most likely due to the higher boiling point and hence lower evaporation rate thus de-creasing the diffusion rate into the EP. Orlu et al. (2006) used 3, 5 and 10 ml ethanol for MSPs preparation, but however MSPs could be prepared only with 3 ml ethanol as IOP. When volume of DCM was increased from 5 to 15 ml in the study of Jelvehgari et al. (2006) a decrease of EE was observed (~87 to 67%), most likely due to the lower-ing of drug concentration. Higher EE values in increase of IOP volume were de-termined by Gupta et al. (2015) and Pawar et al. (2015) probably due to the better drug solubility, but however in-verse correlation for interaction term of polymer amount and IOP volume was observed. Alike were the results of Srivastava et al. (2012) where additionally quadratic func-tions of investigated variables` influence upon EE were de-termined. Inverse dependency of EE to (IOP)2 might be linked to the formation of more porous MSPs thus facili-tating drug partitioning into the EP. Influence of surfactant concentration in the outer water phaseCurcumin EE of ERS100/EC MSPs (Arya and Pathak, 2014) showed positive correlation with the interaction of EC and PVA, while negative correlation was estab-lished with the influence of quadratic terms (EC2*PVA, EC2*PVA2). Influence of PVA on the EE was also deter-mined in the study of Jelvehgari et al. (2006) where ob-tained results pointed that benzoil peroxide EE was higher at lower PVA concentration (EE of 93.26% at 0.047% PVA and 77.87% at 0.187% PVA). Similar results were report-ed by Abdelmalak and El-Menshave (2012) where flucon-azole EE was inversely dependent from PVA concentration (EE ~40% at 0.75% PVA to > 70% at 0.5% PVA). These observations were explained by probable formation of al-ternative hydrophobic regions dissolving some drug por-tions thus resulting with decreased EE.Opposite findings were determined when PVA solu-tion in a concentration of 0.03 to 0.07% was used as EP for preparation of domperidone ERS100 MPSs (Osmani et al., 2015b) and hence EE was ~76 to 90%, respective-ly. The difference with the previous studies might be re-lated to the low PVA concentration used. Similar were the findings for diclofenac diethylamine ERS100 MPSs (Os-mani et al., 2015a) prepared with sodium alginate solution (0.03 to 0.07%) as EP which were characterized by slight increase of EE (~85 to 93%), consequently.ReferencesAbdelmalak, N.S., El-Menshave, S.F., 2012.

They represent thermodynam-ically unstable disperse system, so it is necessary to add suspending agent which reduces the rate of settling and permits easy redispersion of any settled particulate matter, both by protective colloidal action and by increasing the consistency of the suspending medium. Gums and other polymers are frequently employed in pharmaceutical sus-pensions as viscosity building, thickening, stabilizing and suspending agents. They are used to delay or prevent sed-imentation by affecting the rheological characteristics of suspensions. Viscosity building agents increase the viscos-ity of an aqueous mixture without substantially modifying its other properties, such as taste. They provide body and improve stability of added ingredients (Moreton, 2010). The aim of the study is optimization of viscosity build-ing agent, xanthan gum in combination with hydroxyethyl cellulose in order to achieve stable oral suspension. In or-der to evaluate the optimal concentration of the viscosity building agent, formulations with different concentration of xanthan gum were made.
