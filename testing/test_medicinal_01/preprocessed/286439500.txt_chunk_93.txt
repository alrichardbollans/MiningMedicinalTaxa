Treatment ofthe three-dimensional MDA-MB231/LEC model with apigenin(Figure 1A) and luteolin (Figure 1B) dose dependently inhibitedCCID formation in the LEC monolayer, with luteolin showinga stronger effect than apigenin. Simultaneous treatment with20 uM luteolin and 20 uM apigenin synergized and inhibitedCCID formation significantly stronger than 40 uM luteolin or40 uM apigenin, respectively, thus suggesting that luteolin andapigenin interfered with distinct pro-intravasative mechanisms(Figure 1C).Apigenin/Luteolin Inhibit MMP1Expression and CYP1A1 Activity inMDA-MB231 CellsMDA-MB231 cell spheroids express MMP1, which is onemechanism causing CCIDs in the adjacent LEC monolayer(Nguyen et al., 2015). Thus, the expression of MMP1 wasinvestigated after treatment of MDA-MB231 cells with apigeninand luteolin. 20 uM apigenin and 20 uM luteolin causeda significant and time-dependent down-regulation of MMP1protein (Figures 2A,B).Another mechanism of breast cancer emboli to cross theendothelial barrier is the secretion of 12(S)-HETE which, inMDA-MB231 cells, is produced by CYP1A1 (Nguyen et al.,2016a). Hence, the activity of CYP1A1 in MDA-MB231 cellswas analyzed by EROD assay after treatment with increasingconcentrations of apigenin and luteolin. 5-20 uM apigeninand luteolin inhibited CYP1A1 activity significantly within 4 h(Figure 3).The results proved that apigenin and luteolin inhibited MMP1expression and CYP1A1 activity, which trigger the retraction ofthe adjacent LEC barrier thereby enabling MDA-MB231 tumorspheroid intravasation.Influence of Apigenin and Luteolin onIntracellular Ca2+ Release in LECThe intravasation of breast cancer cells relies on an interplaybetween cancer emboli and the LEC barrier (Vonach et al., 2011;Viola et al., 2013). Therefore, it was investigated whether apigeninFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 220246fphar-09-00220 March 12, 2018 Time: 13:3 # 6Hong et al. Inhibition of Intravasation by FlavonoidsFIGURE 5 | Analysis of drug combinations on CCID formation. MDA-MB231 spheroids were placed on LEC monolayers and treated with solvent (DMSO, Co), or(A,B) 20 uM apigenin, or (C,D) 20 uM luteolin, alone, or together with (A,C) 5 uM BAPTA-AM, or together with (B,D) 2.5 uM U73122 for 4 h, after which CCIDareas were measured using an Axiovert microscope and Zen little 2012 software. Three independent experiments with at least five replicates were analyzed. Errorbars indicate means +- SEM and asterisks and hash significances (*p < 0.05; t-test).or luteolin would also inhibit the pro-intravasative response ofLECs.The release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores plays a centralrole in MMP1- and 12(S)-HETE-induced CCID formation(Nguyen et al., 2016b; Stadler et al., 2017). Hence, it was testedwhether apigenin and luteolin affected intracellular Ca2+ release.Luteolin prevented MMP1-induced Ca2+ increase (Figure 4A),which is consistent with previous reports (Jiang et al., 2005). Incontrast, apigenin did not reduce MMP1-induced Ca2+ levelsin LECs, but in contrast increased Ca2+ release (Figure 4B).This is in agreement with data that apigenin activates potassiumchannels leading to their hyper-polarization and causingthe release of Ca2+ (Erdogan et al., 2007). Accordingly,treating the MDA-MB231/LEC model with apigenin andBAPTA-AM (intracellular Ca2+ inhibitor) caused a significantlystronger inhibition of CCID formation than apigenin alone,or BAPTA-AM alone (Figure 5A). Ca2+ release is dependenton PLCb activity and, therefore, also the co-treatment withapigenin and U73122 (PLC inhibitor) attenuated CCIDformation significantly stronger than the treatment withjust apigenin or U73122 (Figure 5B). Luteolin amelioratedthe CCID-inhibitory effect of BAPTA-AM (Figure 5C) orU73122 (Figure 5D) even more efficiently than apigenin.Overall, these data support the notion that an additionalintravasative mechanism, which was independent of Ca2+signaling, must have been inhibited by apigenin and luteolin aswell.Luteolin/Apigenin InhibitPhosphorylation of Tyr397-FAK in LECThe FAK controls cell-matrix interactions and mobility (Schwocket al., 2010) as observed in CCID formation (Nguyen et al.,2015). Recombinant MMP1 induced the phosphorylation ofFAK at Tyr397 indicative for its activation.
