There are in effect two key functions that have been posited for this process of using symbols to make explicit and concrete otherwise invisible, spiritual or emotional forces. The first, and most important, relates to the concept of coping. Disease, it is often argued, is a disruptive life event, one that engenders considerable disorder, chaos and anxiety in the patient.70 The primary function of the witchdoctor's, priest's or sorcerer's healing ritual, according to medical anthropologists, was therefore to restore cognitive order - a kind of "bloodless, gutless" homeostasis to borrow Wilson's (2004) phrase - and thereby to calm the patient: The medicine man is a soul doctor and his fellow primitive whom we know as an emotionalist needs him badly... His rigid system, which ignores doubt, dispels fear, restores confidence and inspires hope. And as Charcot said: the best inspirer of hope is the best physician. (Ackerknecht 1971: 130, my emphasis) 70 See Clements (1932) for a fascinating nosology of primitive disease concepts from all over the world, which he taxonomises under the five main 'families' of sorcery, breach of taboo, disease-object intrusion, spirit intrusion and soul loss. 130 Highlighting that a sorcerer's healing ritual would often consist not only of medicinal herbs or other material implements but also a myth or narrative to go along with them, Levi-Strauss argued that "the technique of the narrative aims at recreating a real experience in which the myth merely shifts the protagonists" and therefore that "the efficacy of the cure would be jeopardized if, even before any results were to be expected, it failed to offer the sick woman a resolution, that is, a situation wherein all protagonists have resumed their places and returned to an order which is no longer threatened" (Levi-Strauss 1968: 194, 197). It is this process of restoring order that has been singled out as the key to coping and therefore to the mechanism of action of symbolic efficacy. Turner, who meticulously documented the symbols used in various rituals by the Ndembu of Zambia in Forest of Symbols, argues that "out of the randomness and incoherence of the environment, the chimbuki [ritual specialist] selects certain items and arrays them in a coherent structure in accordance with his sensitivity to Ndembu evaluations and symbolism and in accordance with his intention of curing a specific, culturally defined disease" (Turner 1967: 351). And in a classic analysis of a Cuna woman's birth ritual in a chapter on 'The effectiveness of symbols', Levi-Strauss concludes: The tutelary spirits and malevolent spirits, the supernatural monsters and magical animals, are all part of a coherent system on which the native conception of the universe is founded. The sick woman accepts these mythical beings or, more accurately, she has never questioned their existence. What she does not accept are the incoherent and arbitrary pains, which are an alien element in her system but which the shaman, calling upon myth, will re-integrate within a whole where everything is meaningful. (Levi-Strauss 1968: 197) The second key function posited for such processes of symbolic restorations of cognitive order is as inciter of the spill-over 'placebo effect'. Notwithstanding the crucial role they attributed to symbolic restorations of order in healing processes in themselves, each of these authors was also fully aware that a question remained as to whether this effect that they were describing was 'merely' a sophisticated account of what had long been known as "suggestion". And there were two particular ways in which this question was tackled. First of all, they argued that the symbolic component of healing was by no means limited to the experiences of 'primitive peoples'. Both Ackerknecht and Turner underlined that "suggestion is one of the major implements of [both] the shaman and of the M.D. ", "it must 131 be admitted that medicine in our culture relies to a certain extent on suggestion..., the general practitioner in British rural areas administered 'nasty' medicines, partly on account of their curative properties and partly to satisfy the patient that they were 'strong' enough to 'kill' the ailment" (Ackerknecht 1971: 161; Turner 1967: 315). Although, all things equal, both agreed with Rivers that there nevertheless were differences in the use of suggestion between primitive and modern medicine, but that these were "only differences in degree" (Ackerknecht 1971: 161). Nevertheless, a question remained over whether effected cures remained in a psychological realm of coping or whether they also spilled over into a corporeal realm, much as psychosomatic disorders were seen to move from the psychogenic (incited by anxiety, stress, fear or trauma) to the somatic (manifest as heart irregularities, digestive disorders, asthma or skin conditions) (cf. Wilson 2004). Turner argues that, in any case, "the distinction between 'medicine' as 'drug' and as 'ritual symbol' is a very fine one, and it is not always possible to make it clearly. All things are felt to be charged with powers of various kinds, and it is the job both of the herbalist and of the ritual specialist to manipulate these for the benefit of society" (1967: 335). Nevertheless, in reflecting over how Ndembu rituals had withstood the test of time, he concludes that in all likelihood there is not too much in the way of physiological cure that can be attributed directly to Ndembu healing rituals, rather any physiological effects are attributable to spill-over placebo efficacy: One reason for their persistence lies, no doubt, in the very fact that they are part of a religious system which itself constitutes an explanation of the universe and guarantees norms and values on which orderly social arrangements rest... Another more practical reason would be that many diseases are self-curing; in the course of time, regardless of treatment they are given, many people recover from illness, but the recovery is attributed to the treatment. Then again, psychological considerations must play a part in the case of mild psychosomatic conditions and in milder cases of somatic illness. Such considerations would include the authoritative air of the doctor-herbalist, the purposive structure of the procedure, the 'shock treatment' aspect mentioned above, and the sense that something traditional is being done about a known and named condition. Here we have an instance of the well-known placebo effect, where medicine is given to humour rather than to cure the patient, but where improvement in health nevertheless results. (Turner 1967: 356) Levi-Strauss, on the other hand, is more adamant in arguing that "this term [psychological cure] will remain meaningless unless we can explain how specific psychological 132 representations are invoked to combat equally specific physiological disturbances", and that a healing ritual "constitutes a psychological manipulation of the sick organ, and it is precisely from this manipulation that a cure is expected" (1968: 191, 192), which suggests a definite physiological 'spill-over' effect. In more detailed terms: The shaman provides the sick woman with a language, by means of which unexpressed, and otherwise inexpressible, psychic states can be immediately expressed. And it is the transition to this verbal expression - at the same time making it possible to undergo in an ordered and intelligible form a real experience that would otherwise be chaotic and inexpressible - which induces the release of the physiological process, that is, the reorganization, in a favourable direction, of the process to which the sick woman is subjected. (Levi-Strauss 1968: 198, my emphasis) In other words, just as psychogenic fear, trauma, anxiety or stress have been claimed to be generative of somatic disorders or even of 'voodoo death' via some kind of intermediate pathways, medical anthropologists have persistently argued that psychogenically induced hope, order, expectation or familiarity can be generative of somatic cure via similar, albeit reversed, pathways of psychosomatic mediation. To sum up, we should not overlook the important role that medical anthropology has had in positing a very real and concrete symbolic efficacy for all therapeutic encounters, irrespective of whether they have been classed as primitive, traditional, modern or alternative. Moreover, the anthropological recasting of an irrational, simple or superstitious 'primitive medicine' into a very rational and complex 'leechcraft' has also played a key role in the relatively recent decriminalisation of placebo, by arguing for the possibility of a physiologically measurable spill-over placebo efficacy released by a real and concrete symbolic efficacy. If this symbolic efficacy is as real and concrete as they claim, then no longer is the resulting placebo efficacy necessarily a case of deceptive suggestion or conscious fraud. Rather, according to medical anthropologists, the redressive restoration of cognitive order and hope in the face of the incoherence, randomness and chaos of disease - the mechanism of action of coping understood as a kind of symbolic homeostasis - is a crucial, rational and material part of any healing process. To be sure, an unfinished and lively debate, not to mention scientific research project, remains over the extent to which, as well as over the specific ways in which, this symbolic efficacy spills over via intermediate pathways into a physiological realm of bio-efficacy. Is it via a conditioned response based on cultural familiarity, a logic of expectation that releases endogenous 133 pharmaceutics (such as the by now infamous endorphins), a hope-generated immunological boost that assists self-healing, or does it indeed remain in the psychological realm as an abreaction-aided restoration of cognitive order which enhances the well-being of a patient?71 The symbolic and clinical effectiveness of Vietnamese and British traditional herbal medicine Now, it might well be asked what on earth do a few 20th century anthropological analyses of the healing rituals of Melanesian, Ndembu, Cuna and Azande communities have to do with the rise of St. John's Wort and Heantos into two prominent herbal remedies in the United Kingdom and Vietnam? To begin with, I argue that the 20th century recasting of primitive medicine into leechcraft and then traditional medicine on the one hand, and fringe medicine into alternative and then complementary medicine on the other, has been in part facilitated by the empirically argued point that these are not the simple, left-over, irrational or backward healing practices and systems that they had long been made out to be. At the same time, in building up a theory of symbolic efficacy, medical anthropology has also played an important role in solidifying a split between 'subjective' illness (where symbolic and cognitive pathways reign) and 'objective' disease (where bio-pathways reign), as well as suggesting possible placebo linkages between them via intermediate pathways. While it continues to be argued by many that the workings of a good part of traditional and alternative therapies are pretty much confined to the subjective realm of illness experience (e.g. assisting patients to cope with their diseases by providing them with a cognitive meaning framework or by engendering hope),72 herbal medicine presents us with an interesting intersection of the symbolic and the somatic. There is no doubt that indigenous traditional herbal medicine in both Vietnam and the United Kingdom comprises not only a range of plant-based remedies for certain ailments, but just as importantly a cognitive framework through which patients can 'think' about their health and illness and thereby conduct their lives accordingly. For example, in a recent handbook, Vietnamese Traditional Medicine is described not just as a collection of various 71 See Harrington (1997) for a collection of essays that make their various cases on these points. 72 For example, the House of Lords Select Committee's report on CAM categorised an entire group of treatments as complementary therapies that "give help and comfort to many patients when used in a complementary sense to support conventional medical care even though most of them lack a firm scientific basis" (see Chapter 3). 134 therapies (herbal medicine, acupuncture, massage, etc. ), but also as a way of "thinking" - closely related to that of traditional Chinese medicine - that "sees disease as an imbalance between yang and yin in particular organs [which] directly affects the circulation of the body's vital energy (khi)" (Huu and Borton 2003: 19). During a consultation, the traditional practitioner uses three methods of diagnosis: "questioning the patient (information about his family, his birth, the functioning of his organs), inspection of the patient's tongue, eyes, sick organs, and so on, and the feeling of the patient's pulse (aimed at determining the nature and category of the disease)" (Hoang, et al. 1999: 6). Through this diagnostic process, the traditional practitioner "discovers the nature of the imbalance and uses his knowledge of medicinal plants and traditional practices to restore the balance, to strengthen the ki, and normalise its circulation in the affected organs to re-create harmony with the universe, thus healing the patient" (Huu and Borton 2003: 19). The handbook goes on to underline that consultations with traditional practitioners are very ordinary occurrences in Vietnam, and even that "some Vietnamese feel uncomfortable in a Western hospital with its smell of alcohol and other chemicals" (Huu and Borton 2003: 21). In the same way, when reporting on the many trials that have been carried out on Heantos at the Hoa Binh Centre for Drug Addiction since the mid 1990s, doctors highlighted that there had been no problem finding voluntary participants, specifically because many were "more comfortable" with taking a traditional Vietnamese remedy (Vietnam. Institute of Chemistry. 1998). Craig (2000: 709) has argued a similar point, suggesting that: Traditional Vietnamese medicine... has a positive affective value for many, and is linked with concepts of identity, familiarity (quen) and compatibility (hop). For some, it is 'our medicine' (thuoc ta), Eastern, as opposed to Western medicine. As such it is routinely characterised as benign, appropriate, compatible, and nutritious or strengthening, whereas Western medicine is widely perceived to be harmful and hot, needing to be restricted. So, there is definitely a symbolic side to traditional Vietnamese healing, which is actively invoked in both the literature about it and in the daily practices of traditional medicine hospitals73 and private traditional practitioners in Vietnam. Having said this, however, to suggest that healing effects resulting from traditional Vietnamese medicine (especially its herbal medicine) are limited to a psychological realm of symbolic pathways, or that their 73 Which, for example, are described as smelling distinctively of herbs rather than chemicals. 135 only therapeutic function is to restore cognitive order thereby assisting Vietnamese patients to cope with their diseases, would be to ignore the arguments of a great number of traditional practitioners, traditional medicine users and scientists in Vietnam. For, although the symbolic value of traditional medicine is without doubt brought into play, there can be no question that claims to efficacy for traditional Vietnamese treatments today also refer to a specific physiological bio-efficacy. Hoang et al. have ironically acknowledged that although the philosophical base of traditional Vietnamese medicine "might make quite a few modern physicians and scientists smile and think that it is only a medley of arbitrary ideas alien to anatomy, physiology, scientific therapeutics and pharmacology,... as it is, this system has ensured for thousands of years the health care of the majority of the population; it is a complex of conventional concepts for an empirical but effective treatment of disease" (1999: 7). At the same time, it is nevertheless argued that "we need to research the results of our traditional medicine" by asking "do these ancient practices possess real therapeutic value?" (Bui 1999: 35; Hoang, et al. 1999: 28) And consequently, clinical testing of traditional therapies has become an important component of Vietnam's ongoing modernisation programme as described in the previous chapter, even more so since the Ministry of Health introduced new safety and efficacy requirements for industrially produced herbal remedies in 1996. According to these new requirements, herbal remedies are subject to pre-clinical quality controls, toxicity tests and pharmacological assays in animals. Pre-clinical data is then evaluated by a scientific committee, which will decide whether clinical trials can begin and also will be responsible for designing a trial protocol. Clinical trials are divided into a number of phases, with herbal remedies first tested in healthy volunteer subjects to evaluate absorption of the medicines, and only then in diagnosed patients to identify a suitable dosage. The next stage is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of a herbal medicine using either a double-blind randomised control trial with a placebo arm as comparison, or if it is considered to be unethical to treat a certain condition with placebo then comparison will be made against a control group receiving a modern medicine that is typically used for the condition under scrutiny. Clinical trial results will finally be evaluated by the scientific 136 committee, who will present their conclusions on the efficacy of the herbal medicine in question (Hoang 2004; Vietnam. Ministry of Health. 1996).74 As a result, efforts to clinically validate the efficacy of Heantos since the early 1990s have in no way been unique to it, as in the past couple of decades animal and human trials have been carried out with various traditional therapies on such conditions as corneal ulcers, post-operative pain, arteriosclerosis, burns and insomnia to name a few. There are of course a number of ways in which this new focus on clinical testing might be accounted for. Some see an increasing focus on modernisation as yet another case of a so-called developing country succumbing to the orthodoxy of a western biomedical hegemony, thereby stripping an authentic traditional medicine of its 'real' value as it becomes modernised (see, for example, Janes 1999). Others suggest that it is part of an ongoing quest in many countries to once and for all "strip traditional medicine of 'superstitious' beliefs" (Van Esterik 1988: 757), by modernising them and subjecting them to rigorous scientific enquiry. What is clear is that modernisation as described in the previous and current chapters is ongoing. And as already underlined, ever since Ho Chi Minh appealed for a uniting of traditional and modern medicine, Vietnamese health officials, scientists and herbalists alike have consistently and adamantly argued for building an "alliance with modern medicine... as a basis for the development of a medicine which is specifically Vietnamese" (Hoang, et al. 1999: 28; cf. also Huu and Borton 2003; Nguyen, et al. 1965). The point here is not that there is some kind of complete consensus as to how, or indeed whether, herbal medicine should be modernised in Vietnam. Indeed, Nguyen has argued that modernisation of traditional Vietnamese medicine calls for a "cautious approach to avoid the risk of empiricism [on the one hand], and on the other hand, of scientific 'vanguardism'", and Hoang has pointed out that there remains considerable resistance to double blind randomised controlled trials from doctors in Vietnam who see treatment with placebo as unethical (Hoang 2004; Nguyen 1999: 38).
