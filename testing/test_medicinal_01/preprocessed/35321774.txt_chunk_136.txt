Noe1 and Bodo Lachmann11Department of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Vienna, Al-thanstrasse 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria2Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of Pristina,Q.K.U, p.n. 10000 Pristina, KosovoThe main objective of the presented study is the evaluation of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) in combination with matrixassisted laser desorption of ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) after tryptic digest with regard to suitability for qualitativecharacterization and identification of humanized and chimericrecombinant monoclonal antibodies (rmAbs) trastuzumab andrituximab and fusion protein abatacept. Moreover, the impact of post-translational modification of these proteins on the electrophoreticbehavior should be evaluated.Trastuzumab (rhuMAb HER2) is a humanized IgG1 rmAb isolated froma mammalian cell line (Chinese hamster ovary, CHO) by continuousperfusion. It is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastaticbreast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 [1]. Rituximab is agenetically engineered chimeric mouse/human rmAb representing aglycosilated immunoglobulin with human IgG1 constant regions andmurine light-chain and heavy chain variable region sequences. Theantibody is produced by CHO cell suspension culture. Rituximab isindicated for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma andrheumatoid arthritis [2]. Abatacept (CTLA4-Ig) is a fusion proteinproduced by rDNA technology in CHO cells that consists of theextracellular domain of human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associatedantigen 4 linked to a modified Fc portion of human immunoglobulinG1. Abatacept is indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [3].In this study, one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and 2-DE electrophoresis inreducing and nonreducing conditions were used for the assessmentof molecular weight and optimization of the deglycosilationprocedure. In addition, isoelectric points (pI) have been determined by2-DE. The applied 2-DE method was optimized for the pI gradient (IPGstrips 3-6 L, 4-7 L, 6-9 L and 3-11 NL), gel concentration andvisualization procedure. Sensitivity and linearity were assessed, as well.One dimensional SDS-PAGE revealed that, in reducing conditions, bothrmAbs are resolved in two distinct Mr species which migrated in twobands confirming the migration behavior typical for IgG antibodieswhich are composed of two identical subunits each composed by twopolypeptide chains: two heavy and two light chains. Under theseelectrophoresis conditions, reduced form of abatacept migrated as asingle sharp band. For both rmAbs, 2-DE gels revealed characteristicglycoprotein migration behavior resulting in highly complex, bandformed typical spot patterns with small differences in molecularweight, but different pIs. On the other hand, 2-DE analysis revealedthat, abatacept, is very complex mixture of different isoforms, morethan 14 spots could be detected with estimated pI range 4.5-5.5.Enzymatic deglycosilation and charge heterogeneity were studied withSDS-PAGE and 2-DE. N-linked oligosaccharides were released with N-glycosidase F. Neuraminidase (sialidase) was used for the cleavage ofsialic acids, O-Glycosidase for release of O-linked glycans andCarboxypeptidase B was used for the study of lysine truncation.For the identification/primary sequence confirmation, experimentallydetermined peptide masses, obtained from MALDI-TOF MS analysis ofin gel trypsin digested abatacept, trastuzumab and rituximab arecompared with calculated peptide masses, by applying the enzymecleavage rules, from three primary sequence databases: MSDB, NCBInrand SwissProt using MASCOT and PROWL search engines [4,5].PeptideMass program was used to in silico cleave entered abataceptsequence with trypsin and to compute generated peptide masses withtheir specified modifications [6]. Antibody concentration, stainingprocedure, amount of trypsin, digestion time, extraction of generatedpeptides and other factors related to the MALDI-TOF samplepreparation and presentation have been studied and optimized.Trastuzumab, rituximab and abatacept were identified from theirrespective gel spots. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis allowed rapididentity confirmation of studied medicinal products.345fifth congress of phArmAcy of mAcedoniA with internAtionAl pArticipAtionMacedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY / BIOMOLECULAR SCIENCESposter presentationsreferences1.

Phar-macogenetic testing for these variants is extremely dependent on aparticular country/population genetic architecture (2).AimTo evaluate the frequencies of four CYP2C19 polymorphisms, exemi-nate the possibility for prediction of CYP2C19 clopidogrel metabolicphenotypes in our population and to compare obtained results withthe data of other populations.mAteriAls And methodsThe study group consisted of 198 subjects of the general populationrecruited from Special Hospital for Surgery Diseases "Filip II". GenomicDNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using QIAGENDNA extraction kit according to the manufacture instructionprocedure (QIAGEN AS, Oslo, Norway). The CYP2C19 genotypes forthe CYP2C19*2 (c.G681A; rs4244285), CYP2C19*3 (c.G636A;rs4986893), CYP2C19*4 (c.A1G; rs28399504) and CYP2C19*5 (c.C1297T;rs56337013) polymorphisms were detected by Real-Time PCR method,using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay according to the manufacturerinstructions. Regarding the CYP2C19 predicted metabolic pheno-types, individuals were stratified into three distinct phenotype groups:extensive metabolizer (EM: homozygous for the wild-type CYP2C19 al-lele), intermediate metabolizer (IM: heterozygous genotype for theloss-of-function CYP2C19 allele) and poor metabolizer (PM: homozy-gous for the loss-of-function CYP2C19 alleles) phenotype.results And discussionOf the 198 subjects (mean age 60,57+- 8,49 years) included in the study,127 (64,14% were male and 71 (35,85%) were female. All the partici-pants were of Caucasian origin. The population frequencies ofCYP2C19 *2; *3 and *4 loss of function alleles, responsible for impairedclopidogrel metabolizm were 18.69; 0.51 and 0.51, respectively. TheCYP2C19*5 loss of function allele was not detected.Results showing genotype distribution of subjects homozygous for thewild type allele (wt/wt), compared to patients heterozygous for theloss of function allele (wt/mut) and patients homozygous for the lossof function allele (mut/mut), regarding all CYP2C19 polymorphisms,are presented in Table 1. All the observed genotype distributions werein Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The prevalence of CYP2C19 metabolicphenotypes in population from R.M is presented in Table2.Among the CYP2C19 alleles, *2 is the most common (ranging from 9-26%) in Caucasians; *3 is relatively rare (0-2%) and the frequency of *4is 0.6%. The CYP2C19*2 and *3 variants account for approximately83% of all PM alleles and are responsible for about 90% PM pheno-types in Caucasians (3,4). Numerous studies that have been done toestablish the frequency of the CYP2C19 polymorphisms have provedthe ethnic specificity of these genetic variants, resulting in signifi-cantly different prevalence of the predicted metabolic phenotypesamong different world-wide populations.Table 1.

Distribution of CYP2C19 variant alleles among different eth-nic groupsconclusionThe frequencies of CYP2C19 allelic variants in our population are sim-ilar to that found in other Caucasian populations. We estimate a PMphenotype frequency of approximately 4,55% in the Macedonian pop-ulation taking as a result of only CYP2C19*2 genetic polymorphism.Using our results we plan to develop a program for individualization ofclopidogrel therapy in R.Macedonia.referencies1.
