Santa Cruz Xoxocotlan, Oaxaca; Mexico.2 Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT), Santa Cruz Xoxocotlan, Oaxaca; Mexico.One of the plants used in traditional medicine in the state of Oaxaca,Mexico is Pinaropappus roseus Less. (Asteraceae); it is used as a topical infusion for the treatment of dermatological infections colonized by Staphylococcus aureus, and another microorganism such as Candida albicans. Currently, it is unknown if its effect is related to the inflammatory response or an antimicobacterial process. The objective of this work was to evaluate the antimicobacterial activity of the aqueous phenolic extract of the leaf tissue of Pinaropappus roseus (APE) on Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The total phenolic compound content of the PAE was 0.368+-0.00 mg gallic acid equivalent/gdb, quantificated by the Folin-Cicolteau method. The antimicobacterial activity of the APE was evaluated by the disk diffusion method, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by macrodilution method. The aqueous phenolic extract has not bactericidal activity. But this showed antifungal activity with a MIC of 0.296+-02 mg/mL. The phenolic aqueous extract was evaluated against antibiotic as sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim mix, ceftriaxone, benzyl penicillin and gentamicin (with inhibition percentages corresponding to 136%, 78%, 71% and 48% respectively). The characterization of the APE was carried out by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS2 allowed the identification of six phenolic compounds (mainly flavones as Luteolin and apigenin).www.ethnopharmacology2021.org24220th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP130. Phenolic metabolites profile of Schisandra rubriflora male and female plant raw material and their in vitro cultures.A. Szopa1, M. Klimek-Szczykutowicz1, P. Kubica1, A. Warzecha1, S. Granica2, H. Ekiert11 Chair and Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Jagiellonian University, Collegium Medicum, Krakow, Poland2 Department of Pharmacognosy and Molecular Basis of Phytotherpay, Medical University of Warsaw, PolandSchisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. is an East-Asian medicinal plant species which fruits have been known in Europe from TCM as e.g. hepatoprotective, antioxidant, antitumour and adaptogenic phytopharmaceuticals [1]. Under our previous research of soil-grown plant material as well as in in vitro cultures of this species we studied phenolic acids and flavonoids [2]. Our current research deal with phenolic compounds biosynthetic potential of plant material and of in vitro cultures of less known Chinese endemic Schisandra species - Schisandra rubriflora Rehder & E.H.Wilson.The aim of the study was chromatographic qualitative and quantitative analysis of fruit, leaf and shoot extracts of male (M) and female (F) specimens collected in different vegetation periods ("Clematis" company, Poland). The estimations were performed also in microshoot culture extracts (M and F lines) growing on agar Murashige-Skoog [3] medium with 1 mg/l 6-benzylaminopurine and 1 mg/l indole-3-butyric acid (30 days).In the all analyzed extracts the presence of 27 phenolic compounds was confirmed by UHPLC-DAD-MS [4]. The quantification of 3 phenolic acids: chlorogenic, neochlorogenic and cryptochlorogenic acids, and 8 flavonoids: hyperoside, rutoside, isoquercetin, quercitrin, trifolin, quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin, was performed by HPLC-DAD [5].The maximal total contents of estimated compounds were equal (mg/100g DW): 430.66 in fruits, 2814.42 (F) and 3452.16 (M) in leaves, and 3282.59 (F) and 2266.06 (M) in shoots.The total content of estimated compounds in extracts from microshoot cultures were equal (mg/100 g DW): F - 515.49 and M - 631.48.Our results documented for the first time, that both, S. rubriflora soil-grown plants and in vitro cultures, are a rich source of phenolic compounds of potentially high antioxidant properties.

Phenolic acid and flavonoid studies, and antioxidant activity of Akebia quinata steam and fruit extracts.A. Szopa, P. Kubica, M. Klimek-Szczykutowicz, K. Jafernik, H. EkiertChair and Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Jagiellonian University, Collegium Medicum, Krakow, PolandAkebia quinata (Houtt.) Decne is an East-Asian origin, medicinal plant species which steams in Europe have become a new pharmacopoeial raw material since 2019 [1]. In traditional phytotherapy A. quinata is recommended as: diuretic, antiphlogistic and analgesic remedy. Moreover is used as the stimulant of the menstrual flow and to promote the milk-secretion [2].Under our study we preformed the qualitative and quantitative HPLC-DAD [3] analyses of phenolic acids and flavonoids of steam and fruit extracts of A. quinata cultivated in Europe ("Clematis" company, Poland). In the both analyzed extracts the presence of 6 phenolic acids was confirmed: caffeic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, isochlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, and rosmarinic acid. Additionally, in the steam extracts the presence of 3 flavonoids was confirmed: isoquercetin, quercitrin and rutoside.The highest total contents of estimated phenolic compounds was confirmed for steam extract - 4244.21 mg/100g DW for phenolic acids, and 1268.82 mg/100g DW for flavonoids. The main compounds (mg/100g DW) were: cryptochlorogenic acid (2045.13), neochlorogenic acid (918.14) and isochlorogenic acid (845.96).The performed for studied extracts estimations with: CUPRAC (cupric ion reducing antioxidant activity), FRAP (ferric reducing ability of palsma), DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and Folin-Ciocalteu (total polyphenol content) methods, reveal the high antioxidant potential of steam extracts.

Antiprotozoal activity of compounds isolated from the root bark of Ziziphus jujuba.O. Sevik1,2, E. Hausmann1,2, S. Cretton1,2, M. Kaiser3,4, M. Cuendet1,21 School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Geneva, Switzerland2 Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Western Switzerland, University of Geneva, Switzerland3 Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Basel, Switzerland4 University of Basel, SwitzerlandHuman protozoal diseases such as malaria, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease and leishmaniosis remain important health problems, with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in tropical countries. For centuries, plants have been used by local populations to prevent and cure human diseases in many parts of the world. According to the WHO, approximately 80% of the African population uses traditional medicine for their health care [1]. In a screening of Niger plants for antiprotozoal activity, the dichloromethane extract of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. root bark exhibited inhibitory activities against Trypanosoma cruzi (IC50 = 7.4 ug/mL), Leishmania donovani (IC50 = 2.7 ug/mL), Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 = 1.7 ug/mL), and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (IC50 = 10.2 ug/mL). Z. jujuba, commonly known as jujube, is traditionally used against diarrhea, ulcers, vomiting, indigestion, pulmonary ailments, dysentery and fever [2,3]. Eight cyclopeptide alkaloids and eight triterpenes were isolated from Z. jujuba. Among these, two compounds have not yet been described in the literature. The antiprotozoal activity was determined for thirteen of the compounds, and their cytotoxicity in L6 rat myoblast cells was measured. Mauritine M is a previously described cyclopeptide alkaloid and is the most active compound with IC50 values around 3-4 uM against T. b. rhodesiense and P. falciparum. Some of the triterpenes showed inhibitory activities against L. donovani (IC50 < 3 uM) and P. falciparum (IC50 < 0.2 uM). Active compounds should be further tested to assess their possible use as antiprotozoal drugs. [1] Abdullahi, A. A., Trends and challenges of traditional medicine in Africa.

Mechanisms of Helleborus cyclophyllus Boiss apoptotic activity on A549 cancer cell line.P. Yfanti1,2, A. Karkabounas1, Ch. Oikonomidis1, A. Tsapinou1, S. Papadopoulos1, D. Myrtai1, E. Papa1, Ei. Kitsiouli1, M.E. Lekka11 Department of Chemistry, University of Ioannina, Greece2 Department of Agriculture, University of Ioannina, GreeceHelleborus cyclophyllus Boiss, locally known as "skarfi", is a wild grown rhizomatous, poisonous plant of rocky Greek mountains, known for its pharmaceutical properties since ancient times. In a previous study its possible anticancer potential was examined. Morphological examination of exposed A549 cancer cells and primary lung fibroblasts to H. cyclophyllus methanol extracts, showed after appropriate staining, that the extract led selectively A549 cancer cells to apoptotic cell death, contrary to primary lung fibroblasts which were used as a model of normal cells. In particular, a few hours after treatment, the cell membrane of A549 cancer cells became waveform and intracellular material was exocytosed through vesicles (ectosomes). Subsequently, the cells were detached, adopted a round, swollen shape including a large vesicle into the cytoplasm, a structure looking like thanatosome. This structure marginated the cell nucleus at the periphery of the cell. Later, the apoptotic action was completed with the formation of numerous apoptotic bodies. In this work we first examined through MTT assay, the cytotoxic activity on A549 cancer cells after 24 h treatment with the extract, in comparison with primary lung fibroblasts. High cytotoxicity against A549 cancer cells was exerted, even at 0.02 mg mL-1, while cleavage of procaspase 3 and PARP1 indicated apoptotic cell death. The apoptosis was mediated through the mitochondrial pathway as indicated by the cleavage of caspase-9 and not of caspase-8. Primary lung fibroblasts were resistant to treatment with H. cyclophyllus Boiss extract. Collectively, all our findings provide evidence for selective apoptotic activity of H. cyclophyllus Boiss extracts towards A549 cancer cells. Further investigation on the structure of bioactive compounds is of interest.Acknowledgement: The authors would like to thank the unit for technical infrastructure, characterization and testing of bioactive substances of the University of Ioannina and the OPENSCREEN-GR network for providing access to the facilities.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org24620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP134. Do bitter phytocompounds target inflammation-related macromolecules?D. Dragos1,2, M. Petran3, TC. Gradinaru3, M. Gilca31 Semiology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania2 Nephrology Clinic, University Emergency Hospital Bucharest, Romania3 Department of Functional Sciences I- Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, RomaniaAn association between the bitter taste of phytochemicals and their anti-inflammatory activity (AIA) was shown in previous studies [1,2]. In order to unravel the potential molecular background of this effect, SwissTargetPrediction was employed, an online tool developed by Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics that provides an estimation of the most probable macromolecular targets (MMT) of a small molecule [3]. Using BitterDB, a database of bitter phytocompounds [4], SuperSweetDB, a database of sweet phytocompounds [5], and some other sources, 141 bitter and 38 sweet phytocompounds were selected and fed to SwissTargetPrediction, which found a total of 1097 MMT for these bitter and sweet phytocompounds. The statistical analysis was performed by means of Fisher's exact test with the aim of finding out significant differences between the MMT of bitter compared with sweet phytocompounds. Given the 1097 calculations performed, the significance threshold was lowered (according to Bonferroni criterion) to 5E-5. As this resulted in only three MMT, the significance threshold was relaxed to 1E-4.
