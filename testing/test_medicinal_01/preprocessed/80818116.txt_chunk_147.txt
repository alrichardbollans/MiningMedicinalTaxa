Ul. D. Cara bb, 1200 Tetovo, Republic of Macedonia* dr-luti@hotmail.comIntroductionOne of chronic disorders of terminal renal failure is also a metabolic disorder of L-Carnitines. L-carnitine in the body acts as an antioxidant fighting the harmful par-ticles in the body known as free radicals, which dam-age the DNA and excite it. The lower concentration of L-carnitine(L-c) in patients treated with hemodialysis (HD) is a consequence of the loss of it through dialisant (Clut-terbuck at al., 2002; Fornasini et al., 2007) digestion and reduce endogenous synthesis as a result of absence of the precursor (predecessor) amino acid Lisine. In the kidney, osmolytes including carnitine are crucial since hyperto-nicity is usual and the kidney must cope with fluctuations of diuresis (increased production of urine) and antidirue-sis. Extracellular osmolarity of medullary cells may be-come more than four-fold that of isotonicity. In healthy in-dividuals, carnitine is freely filtered and tubular resorption of free carnitine (FC) is almost complete. What is excret-ed in urine is carnitine ester, or acylcarnitine (AC). In healthy people, the renal clearance of AC is four to eight times that of FC.Impairment of excretion of AC occurs with deteriorating renal function leading to decreased car-nitine clearance and resulting in elevated plasma levels of carnitine.Uremic patients have elevated levels of AC that occur as both elevated FC and total carnitine before (Ar-duini et al., 2006). Due to accumulation of metabolic in-termediates, impaired carnitine biosynthesis, reduced pro-tein intake, and increased removal of carnitine through he-modialysis (HD), patients who undergo routine HD usu-ally present with plasma carnitine. (Cibulka et al., 2005) There are documented facts that the plasma levels of L-C at the end of each dialysis session slimmed down to about 70-80% on average. This reduction in plasma levels of L-carnitine affter HD is a consequence of epoetin-resis-tant anemia, intradyalitic hypotension,cardiomyopathy, fa-ti-gue,muscle weakness, of various inflammation, reduced endogenous synthesis of cofactors of L-Carnitines and malnutrition. L-Carnitines affects remodeling of phospho-lipidic membrane of red blood cells, stimulates erythropoi-esis in high concentrations>200 mmol/L, increases surviv-al time of red blood cells, redu-ces oxidative stress through the hem oxygenasis-1, and It reduces inflammation, and re-duces the value of C-reactive protein (PCR) and lipids. A large number of observers have documented studies of an inverse correlation between the dose of rHuEPO and car-nitine level. Randomized and controlled studies in a meta-analysis suggest that supplementation with L-Carnitines has shown positive effects in response to therapy with Erythropoie-tin in chronic uremic patients treated with HD. Uremic pa-tients treated with HD due to low values of L-C often man-ifest anemia resistant to therapy with human Eritropoet-in Recombinant (rHuEpo) with substitution with L-Carni-tines significantly reduces the resis-tence to therapy with rHuEpo, with K/DOQI association recent years suggests that patients treated with chronic HD and resistant to ther-apy by the end of the session with HD must necessarily be treated with L-Carnitine (KDOQI Clinical Practice guide-lines 2008-2009). Aim of this paper was to show the effects of L-Carnitine in uremic patients treated with HD.S6 PP 286598Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 597 - 598 (2016)Clinical pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular sciencesPoster presentationsMaterials and methodsIn total 100 patients treated with chronic HD were studied. Of the 100 patients treated with HD-46 (45%) were female- 54 (55%) were male, with an average iden-tical age of 58.70+-12.60, treated over 8 years in Tetovo Clinical Hospital and Clinic Skopje. Patients were divid-ed into two groups: The first group comprised of 65 pa-tients had a sensitive reaction to therapy with rHuEpo dose of 2000-4000 IU after HD subcutaneous and the second group consisted of 11 women and 12 men who after HD had the highest value carnitine clearence on even after in-creasing the dose showed a resistance to therapy after 6-8 weeks and we decided that this patients to be trea-ted with L-C ampoules of 1 g after each session of HD and 2x500 mg L-C in the form tablets days that have not HD. With-in 8 months of this dose, we have seen a rapid increase in the level of carnitines, reaching levels two to three times higher than the concentration of physiological L-C and high impact to eritropoesis and stimulation of erythroblasts (11,12) as well as positive effects on therapy with rHuEpo which was manifested with adjustment of blood (Er, Hb, Htc) and improvement of symptoms of renal anemia . Our study confirms the elimination of L-C of 16.80 +- 28.40% over a period of 8-12 months of treatment with HD.Results and discussionBefore starting the Epo therapy mean values of Hb in-female patients were 5.20+-1.15 mmol / l, while in males were=5.60+-1.10 mmol/l, the number of Er in female was:2.90+- 0.86 x 10 12 / l, while in males were=3.20+- 0.90 x 10 12/l. Values of HTC in female were=0:24 +- 0:04 while the men-12:28+-12:06. After treatment with EPO therapy and amp. L-Carnitine a 1.0 g intravenously at the end of the session that the HD the desired target Hb was > 6.80 mmol / l and after 16 weeks the women target was Hb> 6:40 mmol/l, while the male target Hb>6.85 mmol/l, the Er number of female reached: 3.60+-0.80x10 12 / l, while in the male were 3.85+-0.80x1012 /l. The values of Htc in the female came up-0.32+- 0.03 while the men-0.04+- 0.35. The comparison of values of patients before treatment with L-carnitine and Epo therapy and after treatment showed a sig-nificant statistical difference of p <0.0001. Statistical pro-cessing: statistical methods that were used are: arithmetic mean value, standard deviation: X +- SD, Studentov,,t"test, Mann-Withney U test,Annova Two-Factor. The results ob-tained from the examination of Hb, Er, Htc are processed and presented in the form of charts, tables and diagrams..ConclusionWe can conclude that patients undernourished, anemic and resistent to therapy with rHuEpo and lower values of the concentrations of L-C after the session with HD, sup-ple-mentation with carnitine (per os or ampular) can im-prove reanale anemia significantl resistant to Epo therapy. Our findings confirm that elimination of L-carnitines after application of L-C in HD decrease from 16.80 +-28.40% .But are necessary further studies with larger number of pa-tients with longer duration so that can be documented and verified the effects of L-carnitine to uremic patients and re-sistant to Epo therapy.

BMC is a mode of micellar liq-uid chromatography that uses micellar mobile phases of Brij35 under adequate experimental conditions. It can be useful in mimicking the drug partitioning process into bi-ological systems, because the characteristics of BMC sys-tem are similar to biological barriers and extracellular flu-ids (Molero-Monfort et al., 2000). On the other hand clas-sical reversed phased HPLC system is recognized as the well-established system for estimation of compounds lipo-philicity. The important role of lipophilicity and its use in prediction of blood-brain permeability of drugs have been demonstrated in several studies (Kaliszan, 2007). Reten-tion data obtained by this method can be further used in correlation studies with some physicochemical and bio-logical properties of tested compounds (Liu et al., 2011). The compounds examined in this study were imidazoline receptor ligands (IRs) (Ernsberger, 2000). IRs have been tested as novel centrally acting antihypertensives and drug candidates for treatment of various neurological disorders (Fenton et al., 2006; Finn et al., 2003). Since these ligands exhibit additional CNS effects, several structurally relat-ed CNS drugs were also included in this research. In this work, the retention data of 16 imidazoline/a-adrenergic re-ceptor ligands and 15 CNS drugs, were examined using BMC and RP-HPLC systems and correlated with permea-bility coefficients (Pe) previously obtained in our laborato-ry using PAMPA (Vucicevic et al., 2015). Materials and methodsChromatographic conditionsChromatographic analysis was carried out on an Agi-lent Technologies 1200 Series system (Santa Clara, CA, USA). BMC analyses were performed on a Zorbax Ex-tend-C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, particle size 5 mm), with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a temperature of 36.5 degC. Micellar mobile phase was prepared by dissolving poly-oxyethylene (23) lauryl ether Brij 35 (Sigma-Aldrich Che-mie Gmbh, Steinheim, Germany) in buffered solution at pH 7.40 (which corresponds to blood pH of humans) to get a final surfactant concentration of 0.04 M. RP-HPLC mea-surements were performed using a XTerra(r) RP18 column (100 mm x 4.6 mm, particle size 3.5 mm). The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min, column temperature was set to 25 degC. Mo-bile phase was consisted of different ratios of methanol and sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 7.40).Computational methodThe Quantitative Structure-Permeability Relationship (QSPR) models were developed using retention data from BMC system. PLS regression analysis was performed us-ing the Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy SIM-CA P+ 12.0 program (Umetrics AB, 2008), while STATIS-TICA 5.0 (StatSoft Inc., 1998) was used for the stepwise MLR and ANN analysis.

The geometry of all compounds have been minimized us-ing B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of the Density Functional Theory (DFT) (Becke, 1993; Lee et al., 1988) included in ChemBio3D Ultra 13.0 program (CambridgeSoft Corpora-tion, 2013). Constitutional, geometrical, physicochemical and electronical parameters of optimized molecular struc-tures were calculated using following software: ChemBi-o3D Ultra 13.0, Dragon 6.0 (Talete srl, 2010) and ADMET Predictor 6.5. Additionally, HOMO and LUMO energies obtained using ChemBio3D Ultra 13.0 were used to cal-culate some quantum chemically based reactivity molecu-lar parameters, such as chemical potential (l), electronega-tivity (v), hardness (g), global softness (S) and electrophi-licity index (x) (Iczkowski and Margrave, 1961; Parr and Yang, 1989). Results and discussionUsing ADMET predictor 6.5 (Simulation Plus, Inc., 2013) and ACD/i-Lab software (http://www.acdlabs.com/resources/ilab/) it was shown that those compounds are not substrates Pgp and their BBB-permeability could be ac-curately predicted by using non-cellular in vitro methods. Significant correlation was obtained between logarithm of BMC retention factor (logkBMC) and effective permeabil-ity (Pe) (R2=0.69), while for RP-HPLC system the corre-lation was lower (R2 logkwRP-HPLC / Pe = 0.49). There-fore it can be concluded that logkBMC parameter could be used as more reliable than logkwRP-HPLC to assess the BBB penetration of IRs/a-ARs ligands and CNS drugs in more time efficient manner. Further, retention factors (logkBMC) of a-adrenergic/imidazoline receptor ligands and CNS drugs were used as dependent (Y) variable in this QSPR studies, while their calculated molecular de-scriptors were selected as independent (X) variables. Par-tial Least Square (PLS) regression, stepwise Multiple Lin-ear Regression (stepwise MLR), and Artificial Neural Net-works (ANN) techniques were applied in order to create new mathematical models. Stepwise MLR analysis have been resulted in statisticaly better performance than PLS and ANN, and therefore MLR/QSPR-logkBMC model was selected as an optimal. The P_VSA_s_5, VE1_RG, P_VSA_p_2 and GATS1e were selected descriptors with the most significant influence on logkBMC and consequent-ly on Pe, indicating on possible structural modifications which could enhance BBB penetration. ConclusionFormed models could be used as time and cost effi-cient screening tool for evaluation of blood-brain barrier permeation of novel a-adrenergic/imidazoline receptor li-gands, as promising drug candidates for treatment of hy-pertension or neurological diseases.
