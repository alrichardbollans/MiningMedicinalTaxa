This legislative package includes: Regulation 852/2004/EC on - the hygiene of foodstuffsRegulation 853/2004/EC on specifi c hygiene rules for - food of animal origin, andRegulation 854/2004/EC laying down specifi c rules for the organisation of - offi cial controls on products of animal origin627. The new regulations merge and harmonise hygiene requirements previously contained in several separate directives. The goal of new hygiene legislation is to make a single, transparent hygiene policy applicable to all food and all food operators in the food chain. This would enable the EU to manage food safety and future food crises.628 The Annexes of Regulation 852/2004/EC contain hygiene rules applicable to primary production (Annex I), and to other food business operators (Annex II). The hygiene rules in Annex II include requirements for rooms where foodstuffs are prepared, treated or processed, requirements for movable and/or temporary premises, transport, equipment, food waste, water supply, personal hygiene, hygiene of the foodstuffs themselves, wrapping and packaging of foodstuffs, heat treatment, and training. Annex III of Regulation 853/2004/EC contains hygiene rules for various foodstuffs or animal origin, which were previously scattered in different Directives. There are rules on meat, fi shery products, eggs, milk, frog's legs and snails, bivalve molluscs, and processed 627 All of these were enacted on 21st April 2004, and came into force in the beginning of 2006. The package includes also Directive 2004/41/EC repealing certain Directives concerning food hygiene and health conditions for the production and placing on the market of certain products of animal origin intended for human consumption and amending Council Directives 89/662/EEC and 92/118/EEC and Council Decision 95/408/EC, 21 April 2004. 628 European Commission web page. http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/hygienelegislation/index_en.htm.-112-products. The rules are quite exact, of the type: "Containers used for the dispatch or storage of unpackaged prepared fresh fi shery products stored under ice must ensure that melt water does not remain in contact with the products"629. To facilitate the application of the new hygiene rules, the Commission has enacted a set of implementing measures, the most important being the Commission Regulation 2073/2005/EC which sets down microbiological criteria for foodstuffs. The Commission has also enacted various transitional rules that help operators adjust their businesses to fi t the new regime630.4.2.1.3 Chemical Safety of Food Chemical safety of foodstuffs is in Europe guaranteed by regulating: food additives, -food fl avourings, -contaminants, -residues and -food contact materials. -The European Commission has in 2008 adopted a legislative package, which updates rules for additives631 and fl avourings632, and harmonises EU legislation on food enzymes633 for the fi rst time. A common approval procedure for food additives, fl avourings and food enzymes was created634. EFSA has an integral role in assessing new substances.635 Only additives, fl avouring, and food enzymes that are on the EU lists can be used, and only under the conditions mentioned in those lists. Often, they can be used in limited quantities636. 629 Regulation 853/2004/EC, Annex III, Section VIII, Chapter III. A(4).630 European Commission web page. http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/hygienelegislation/legisl_en.htm.631 Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives. The regulation, except transitional provisions, will apply by 20 January 2010. Additives that are permitted under the old directives 94/35/EC, 94/36/EC and 95/2/EC will be put Community list of food additives. Their conditions of use are fi rst to be reviewed, and this review should be completed by January 2011.632 Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 on fl avouring and certain food ingredients with fl avouring properties amending Council Regulation (EEC) no 1601/91, Regulations (EC) No 2232/96 and (EC) No 110/2008 and Directive 2000/13/EC. The regulation will apply on 20 January 2010. However, the old Regulation 2232/96/EC will continue to apply until the date of application of the Community list of fl avourings.633 Regulation (EC) No 1332/2008 on food enzymes and amending Council Directive 83/417/EEC, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, Directive 2000/13/EC, Council Directive 2001/112/EC and Regulation (EC) No 258/97. The regulation applies from 20 January 2009, except labelling provisions from 20 January 2010. National provisions apply in the Member States until the adoption of the Community list of enzymes applies.634 Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food fl avourings.635 See Luetzow 2006.636 European Commission web page. http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/additives/comm_legisl_en.htm.-113-Additives are substances added to foods for some technological purpose, for example to preserve, to sweeten or to colour637. Flavourings638 are substances used to give taste and/or odour to food. Enzymes are added to perform a technological function for example in the manufacture, transport, or storage of a food639. Additive, fl avouring, and enzyme rules do not apply to substances added to foodstuffs as nutrients, such as vitamins or minerals. The enzyme Regulation does not extend to enzymes for nutritional or digestive purposes640. These are regulated under the rules of food fortifi cation. See below.Contaminants are substances that have not been intentionally added to food. Foodstuffs may be contaminated by environmental contamination, or in various stages of the food chain, for example production, packaging, or transport. The aim of EU legislation is to minimise contaminants in foodstuffs. Basic principles of EU legislation on contaminants in food are in Council Regulation 315/93/EEC. Maximum levels for certain contaminants in certain foods are set in Commission Regulation 1881/2006/EC641. The following contaminants are included: nitrate, mycotoxins (afl atoxins, ochratoxin A, patulin, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisins, T'-2 and HT-2-toxin), metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, inorganic tin), 3-MCPD, dioxins and PCBs, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).642Residues are chemicals that are intentionally used in some part of the food chain but which are not intended to be present in foods. Animals are treated with medicines, which leads to residues of these medicines in meat, milk and eggs643. Plants are fertilised and treated with pesticides. Veterinary medicines and their maximum residue levels are evaluated according to regulation 2377/90/EC. The basic directive setting maximum residue levels for pesticides (90/642/EEC) has been amended dozens of times.Food contact materials are materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs644. This includes food packaging but also knives and forks, plates and glasses, bowls and jars, blenders and mixers. The framework regulation 1935/2004/EC sets up general requirements for all food contact materials. Specifi c directives exist for ceramics, regenerated 637 The full defi nition of "additive" is the following: "any substance not normally consumed as a food in itself and not normally used as a characteristic ingredient of food, whether or not it has nutritive value, the intentional addition of which to food for a technological purpose in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of such food results, or may be reasonably expected to result, in it or its by-products becoming directly or indirectly a component of such foods". Regulation 1333/2008/EC, Article 3(2)(a).In addition, there is a long list of substances that are not considered additives.638 "Flavourings" are "products: (i) not intended to be consumed as such, which are added to food in order to impart or modify odour and/or taste; (ii) made or consisting of the following categories: fl avouring substances, fl avouring preparations, thermal process fl avourings, smoke fl avourings, fl avour precursors or other fl avourings or mixtures thereof ". There are several additional defi nitions in the Regulations.639 The full defi nition of "food enzyme" is the following: "a product obtained from plants, animals or micro-organisms or products thereof including a product obtained by a fermentation process using micro-organisms:(i) containing one or more enzymes capable of catalyzing a specifi c biochemical reaction; and(ii) added to food for a technological purpose at any stage of the manufacturing, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of foods". Regulation 1332/2008/EC, Article 3(2)(a).640 Regulation 1332/2008/EC, preamble 4.641 This Regulation entered into force on 1 March 2007.642 Investigations are ongoing on acryl amide, organotins, furan, and ethyl carbamate.643 European Commission web page. http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/residues/index_en.htm.644 European Commission web page. http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/foodcontact/index_en.htm.-114-cellulose fi lm and plastics. Food contact materials must be safe and not transfer their components into the foodstuff in unacceptable quantities645. Intelligent and active packaging is allowed by the new Regulation. If an active packaging changes the composition or sensory properties of the product, the changes are evaluated according to rules on additives646.4.2.1.4 Safety of Dietetic Foods Foodstuffs intended to satisfy particular nutritional requirements of specifi c groups of the population are called "foods for particular nutritional uses", "dietetic foods" or "dietary foods". Sometimes they have also been referred to as "PARNUTS" foods. Council directive 89/398/EEC647 is the framework directive on dietetic foods. Foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses are foodstuffs which, owing to their special composition or manufacturing process, are clearly distinguishable from foodstuffs for normal consumption, which are suitable for their claimed nutritional purposes and which are marketed in such a way as to indicate such suitability. A particular nutritional use must fulfi l the particular nutritional requirements:of certain categories of persons whose digestive processes or metabolism are disturbed; or -of certain categories of persons who are in a special physiological condition and who -are therefore able to obtain special benefi t from controlled consumption of certain substances in foodstuffs; orof infants or young children in good health. - 648 Consideration is given to whether the foods in question are clearly distinguishable for their claimed nutritional purposes from ordinary foods. They should be consumed by specifi c group of population for a particular physical or physiological condition and/or specifi c disease or disorder, and they should be signifi cantly different from ordinary foods in composition.649 Examples of dietetic foods are children's foods, gluten-free foods (for people with celiac disease), low-lactose and lactose free products (for people with lactose intolerance), low-sodium products, clinical nutrition (medical foods), weight-loss products, and sports nutrition. The marketer decides whether to sell the product as a dietetic food.650 Below in chapter 5 we will discuss this marketing decision and alternatives to marketing the product as dietetic food. The framework directive sets out a framework of rules for the composition, marketing and labelling requirements of dietetic foods, including measures to ensure the appropriate use of such foods and to exclude any risk to human health. However, the framework directive does not entail exact safety criteria. Actual compositional requirements, hygiene requirements, lists of additives, purity criteria, etc. are to be found in separate directives for the following foods: 645 European Commission web page. http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/foodcontact/eu_legisl_en.htm.646 Regulation 1935/2002/EC, Article 4(1).647 Council Directive of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses (89/398/EEC).648 Article 1.2. of the directive.649 Kwak - Jukes 2000b, 111.650 Food Safety Agency web page. http://www.evira.fi /portal/fi /elintarvikkeet/valvonta_ja_yritt__j__t/erityisruokavaliovalmisteet/.-115-infant formula and follow-on formula - 651,processed cereal-based foods and baby foods (weaning foods) - 652,foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction - 653, andfoods for special medical purposes - 654. The nutritional substances that can be added to dietetic foods are controlled either through positive lists included in the specifi c directives or by Commission Directive 2001/15/EC655, the Annex of which has been amended656 to include additional substances657. The Annex has 5 pages and includes vitamins, minerals, amino acids, carnitine and taurine, nucleotides, and choline and inositol.658 The choice of substances should be based primarily on their safety, and the permission to use certain substances does not mean that their addition is necessary or desirable659. Rules on infant formula and follow-on formula were recently revised by Directive 2006/141/EC660. These are products designed to satisfy the specifi c nutritional requirements of healthy infants and young children. Infant formulas are used as sole nutrition, and follow-on formula as the primary liquid element in the diet as the infant grows and starts to eat solid food. Processed cereal based foods and other baby foods, regulated by Directive 2006/125/EC661, are intended for use by infants while they are being weaned, and by young children as a supplement to their diet and/or for their progressive adaptation to ordinary food662. "Infant" means a baby under the age of 1, and "young child" a child between the ages of 1 and 3. Weight-loss-foods are regulated by directive 96/8/EC663. The Directive lays down compositional criteria for weight-control products that are either A) total daily diet replacements 651 Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formula and follow-up formula and amending Directive 1999/21/EC.652 Commission Directive 2006/125/EC of 5 December 2006 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children.653 Commission Directive 96/8/EC of 26 February 1996 on foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction.654 Commission Directive 1999/21/EC of 25 March 1999 on dietary foods for special medical purposes.655 Commission Directive 2001/15/EC of 15 February 2001 on substances that may be added for specifi c nutritional purposes in foods for particular nutritional uses.656 By Commission Directive 2004/5/EC of 20 January 2004 and by Commission Directive 2006/34/EC.657 Addition of substances into infant formula, follow-up formula, processed cereal-based foods and baby foods intended for infants and young children is regulated in separate directives covering these dietetic foods. Addition of substances into medical foods is regulated by both the separate directive (vitamins and minerals) and the general directive (amino acids). Addition of substances into weight-loss foods is covered by directive 2001/15/EC.658 Most of allowed substances can be used in all dietary foods, but some amino acids can be used only in medical foods.659 Directive 2001/15/EC, preamble 4.660 Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formula and follow-up formula and amending Directive 1999/21/EC.661 Commission Directive 2006/125/EC of 5 December 2006 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children (Codifi ed version).662 Article 1(2).663 Commission Directive 96/8/EC of 26 February 1996 on foods intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction-116-or B) individual meal replacements664. The compositional criteria include energy, protein quantity and quality, fat quantity and type, minimum and maximum levels for dietary fi bre, and minimum levels for certain vitamins and minerals. Medical foods (dietary foods for special medical purposes) are foods that are specifi cally formulated, processed and intended for the dietary management of diseases, disorders or medical conditions of individuals who are being treated under medical supervision. These foods are covered by Directive 1999/21/EC665. Medical foods are intended for the feeding of people whose nutritional requirements cannot be met by normal foods or other dietary foods666. This means medical foods are not a suitable legal category for functional foods. Medical foods in practice are liquids or powders that contain carbohydrates, fat etc., for example for cancer patients. Medical foods may be marketed within the Community only if they comply with the rules laid down in the Directive. The formulation of medical foods shall be based on sound medical and nutritional principles. Their use, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, shall be safe, benefi cial, and effective in meeting the particular nutritional requirements of the persons for whom they are intended, as demonstrated by generally accepted scientifi c data, and the foods must comply with the compositional criteria specifi ed in the Annex of the Directive.667 A separate directive does still not regulate foods for athletes, even though they are included in the framework directive list of groups of dietary foods for which specifi c rules shall be set out. The directive has been "looming in the background" for a long time, as manufacturers were already in the beginning on 2005 worried about its possible restrictive and negative effects668. In the White Paper on Food Safety, the Commission announced the intention to introduce a specifi c Directive on foods intended to meet the needs resulting from intense muscular effort.
