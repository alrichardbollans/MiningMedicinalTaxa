It is also present in medical prod-ucts administered intravenously (anti-cancer drugs, hepa-rins, cardiovascular drugs) and as a preservative in many topical preparations, such as antifungal and anti-inflamma-tory products (Ph.Eur., 2014). However benzyl alcohol is mainly used as an excipient in medicinal products that are administered intramuscularly, such as antibiotics, anti-in-flammatory or neuroleptic medicines where its anesthetic properties reduce pain at the injection site. Objective: Validation and quantifications of Bacterial endotoxins with Turbidimetric kinetic method, for benzyl alcohol. Materials and methodsBenzyl alcohol (Merck Certified; Merck KGaA, Darm-stadt, Germany); Reagents for Kinetic turbidrimetric meth-od: PYROGENT(tm)- 5000, LAL Reagent Water, and Py-rosperse(tm) Dispersing Agent, one of a group of metallo-modified polyanionic dispersants which has proven useful as a sample modifying agent for certain types of products showing inhibition in the BET assay from Lonza (Lonza Group Ltd, Walkersville, MD21793), along with Micro-plate reader ELx808 from BIO-TEK(r) (BIO-TEK Instru-ments, INC.,P.O.BOX998, Hghlsand Park, Winooski, Ver-mont 05404 USA). The results were calculated and stored with WinKQCL 4.0.2 software(tm) (Lonza Group Ltd, Walk-ersvilleThe Kinetic turbidrimetric method is based on mea-suring the turbidity (optical density) of an LAL/sample mixture at regular interval troughout the test. The time re-quired before the appearance of turbidity (Reaction time) is inversely proportional to the amount of endotoxin present. In accordance with the Ph. Eur. Commission at its 149th Session, June 2014: Substances to be used in par-enteral preparations must comply with the BET, whatever their origin, since:- contamination by bacterial endotoxins can take place prior to or during the manufacturing process;- bacterial endotoxins cannot easily be removed by the manufacturing process;- bacterial endotoxins should be detected as early as possible in the manufacturing process.It is to be noted that the ICH Guideline Q6B: Specifi-cations: Test Procedures and Acceptance Criteria for Bio-technological/Biological Products provides the following recommendation under section Drug Substance Specifi-cation: "Pharmacopoeial tests (e.g., endotoxin detection) S2 PP 71160Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 159 - 160 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsshould be performed on the drug substance, where appro-priate".Benzyl alcohol, as an excipient in parenteral prepa-rations, has strongly inhibitory effect on Bacterial endo-toxins test (Kinetic Turbidimetric method) when diluted with LAL reagent water (LRW). It is necessary to over-come the inhibition and for that purpose 2% solution of Py-rosperse(tm) Dispersing Agent from Lonza was used in com-bination with laboratory techniques: shake 30min, vortex 30sec. and centrifuge 3min. (3000rpm/min), (British Phar-macopoeia, 2014; EMA, 2013; FDA, 2012; Ph.Eur., 2014; Thomas et al., 1984)Results and discussionValidation was performed by beginning with screen-ing (Inhibition / Enhancement) test. For that purpose PY-ROGENT(tm)- 5000, Lonza's reagents were used; lysate sensitivity l = 0,01 EU/mL; maximum valid dilution (MVD) = ELC/l = 2.5 / 0.01 = 250. Most products in-terfere with the performance of the BET. The easiest way to overcome interference is to dilute the product in LRW. Dilutions used for preliminary, Inhibition / Enhancement test were as follows: 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:16, 1:32, 1:64, 1:128 and the MVD 1:250. All dilutions were made with LRW (FDA, 2012; Ph.Eur., 2014; McCullough, 2011; Williams, 2009). Benzyl alcohol shows strong inhibition includ-ing MVD. To overcome the inhibition new dilutions were made. For the first dilution 1:10, as a solvent 2% solution of Pyrosperse(tm) Dispersing Agent, from Lonza was used, shaked for 30 min, vortexend for 30 sec and centrifuged 3 min (3000 rpm/min). Tested dilutions: 1:50, 1:100 and 1:200 were made from the aqueous part of the first dilu-tion. Aqueous part was used for analysis. There was an in-hibition only at 1:50 dilution, PPC recovery: not applicable (N/A). The inhibition was overcomed at 1:100 and 1:200 dilution which gave PPC recovery 73% and 115% respec-tively (Lonza Group Ltd, Walkersville; Ph.Eur., 2014). Upon received results the validation further was done on three consecutive batches of benzyl alcohol with di-lution 1:200 (considering that recovery must be close to 100%). The endotoxin concentration reported for the three consecutive batches was less than 2.00 EU/ml with PPC 115%, 149% and 151% respectively. All three batches of the tested benzyl alcohol showed endotoxin recovery be-tween 50 and 200%.ConclusionValidation of the Bacterial endotoxins test on Benzyl alcohol was successfully done. The inhibition was over-come. Further, routine testing of Benzyl alcohol should be done with dilution 1:200 using Pyrosperse(tm) Dispersing Agent from Lonza, shaking for 30 min, vortexing for 30 sec and centrifuge 3 min (3000 rpm/min) in accordance with the method developed.ReferencesBacterial endotoxins Ph.

Many of the anti-anxiety medicines also cause some sedation, so the same medicine is of-ten functioning clinically as both, anxiolytic and hypnot-ic agent. Benzodiazepines are the most widely used anx-iolytic medicines. They have largely replaced barbiturates in the treatment of anxiety, because the benzodiazepines are safer and more effective. Anxiety is an unpleasant state of tension, apprehension, a fear that seems to arise from a sometimes unknown source. The physical symptoms of severe anxiety are similar to those of fear (such as tachy-cardia, sweating, trembling, and palpitations) and involve sympathetic activation. Episodes of mild anxiety are com-mon life experiences and do not warrant treatment. How-ever, the symptoms of severe, chronic, debilitating anxi-ety may be treated with antianxiety medicines (sometimes called anxiolytic or minor tranquilizers) and/or some form of behavioral or psychotherapy.Bromazepam is a benzodiazepine (BZD) generally used for a number of medical reasons, it is an intermidi-ate-acting tranquiliser (Ashton, 2005), prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe anxiety and panic attacks for the short-term treatment of insomnia. It has been wide-ly used in psychiatry disorders for four decades, with selec-tive anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myorelaxant and hypnotic actions. It acts on the central neural system as an inhibitor of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Nascimento et al., 2012).Bromazepam is an active substance that belongs to class of 1,4-benzodiazepine and chemically corresponds to 7-bromo-1,3-dihydro-5-(2-pyridyl)-2H-1,4-benzodi-azepine-2-one, C14H10BrN3O (Ph.Eur., 2010). It is a con-trolled psychotropic substance-B1 class according to the National Agency of Sanitary Vigilance in Brazil (ANVI-SA), with the DCB identification numbers: 01366, DCI: 2692 and CAS: 1812-20-2. The solid dosage form (tablet) is the widespread used and prescribed in clinical practice. The solid dosage form presents problems associated to the bioavailability (FDA, 2003). The absorption of active sub-stance from the solid dosage form for oral application de-pends on the solubility and dissolution in physiologic liq-uids and its permeability through the gastrointestinal tract, factors that influence directly its bioavailability and sub-sequent pharmacological effects. The biotransformation from solid into absorbable form depends on its dissolution in organic liquids; therefore, dissolution tests became an essential parameter to determine the properties of biophar-maceutical formulations in order to predict their quality. The quality of pharmaceutical formulations is important in financial and ethical terms because it is directly associat-ed with the patient's health. Thus, there is a real need for the development of dissolution tests able to predict in vivo physiological conditions.Materials and methodsDissolution test is a standardized method for measur-ing the rate of active substance release from a dosage form (FDA, 1997). The test was performed on ERWEKA DT 700, apparatus 2 (paddle), using 0.1 M HCl as a dissolu-S2 PP 72162Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 161 - 162 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationstion medium, in volume of 500 ml, at 37degC, with 75 rpm for 45 minutes.The quantity of the dissolved bromazepam was deter-mined using analytical method based on High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Validation of the method was performed on Shimadzu Nexera HPLC system.To optimize chromatographic parameters several mo-bile phase compositions were tested in this method. A sat-isfactory separation, good peak symmetry and optimal re-tention time was obtained using mobile phase consisting of a mixture of methanol, acetonitrile and potassium di-hydrogen phosphate buffer (11.33 g/l of KH2PO4, pH 7.0 adjusted with KOH, 0.5 M) in ratio of 45:5:50 (v/v/v), at flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. A LiChrospher RP Select B col-umn (125 x 4.0 mm, 5mm) was used as stationary phase with temperature of column oven, 50 degC. The elution was monitored at 239 nm.Results and discussionA simple reverse phase HPLC method for in vitro dis-solution test was developed and validated for the determi-nation of bromazepam and its release from pharmaceutical dosage form. Several high-performance liquid chromato-graphic (HPLC) methods have also been reported for the determination of bromazepam and other BZDs (Sruthi et al., 2013). Chromatogram showed a peak of bromazepam (BZP) at retention time of 3.50 +- 0.1 min. The most suit-able mobile phase was selected on the basis of time re-quired for the analysis and the sensitivity of the method. The method was validated according to ICH Q2 guideline with respect to specificity, linearity (with correlation coef-ficient of 0.999), accuracy, precision, robustness, solution stability and filter paper compatibility. All results of the validation parameters were within the limits of ICH guide-lines (ICH, 2005). The benefits of the proposed method in-clude simple preparation of the solutions for the analysis and usage of readily available solvents. ConclusionThe proposed method is simple, rapid, accurate, pre-cise and specific without interference of excipients. The short chromatographic run time allows the analysis of a large number of samples in short period of time. There-fore, it is suitable for the routine analysis of bromazepam in pharmaceutical dosage forms and it could be used for the rapid and reliable determination of dissolved bromaze-pam in tablet formulations. The present study was focused on minimizing method limitations and developing a simple and economic method for determination of dissolved bro-mazepam from tablet dosage form.ReferencesAshton, H., 2005.
