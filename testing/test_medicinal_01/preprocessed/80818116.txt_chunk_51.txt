Majka Tereza No 47 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* kokolanski@live.comAs technological innovations advanced so did the medical devices that became part of surgery (so called in-vasive surgery) from the mid 19th century onward. There are many medical devices that are used in diverse surgical procedures on a daily basis (medical equipment and instru-ments). Medical devices covers a wide spectrum of differ-ent technological devices starting from simple depressors to complex, highly-technical and computerized devices. They play a crucial role in healthcare, whether in small, ru-ral healthcare facilities or in expert medical diagnostic and treatment centers (Radisic, 2008). An additional proof of their necessity and significance is the fact that many gov-ernments across the world provide more than one billion Euros for medical purposes (WHO, 2003). The purpose of this paper is to address the necessity of legal regulation of the types of liabilities of the entities in-volved for damage caused by using the medical devices in the R. Macedonia.The technological advance of the modern medical de-vices is one of the most important elements of an efficient healthcare system. However, specific medical devices can be hazardous to the health of the medical staff or patients. There are numerous risks such as: improper alignment of the medical device, improper and inadequate usage of it, inadequate maintenance, and inadequate supervision be-fore and after usage, breaking down of the medical device as well as the existence of dysfunctional medical devic-es. The medical devices that are most harmful for the pa-tients' inner and outer body are the ones with specific us-age, features, positioning and way of usage. (Tupanchevs-ki et al., 2012) Having in mind the increased usage of different medi-cal devices that are harmful to the patients' overall health, the liability of the inflicted harm is also a big legal prob-lem. Furthermore, this represents a complex social and le-gal problem, not just because it hasn't been regulated by specific legal norms, but because it has been expanding rapidly as well.The liability for the damage caused by the use of med-ical devices in most legal systems as it is the case with Re-public of Macedonia is not separately regulated. On the contrary, the liability is regulated by several laws of differ-ent legal disciplines. Namely the types of liability for the caused damage from using of medical devices can be the following: a) disciplinary liability (for which the most se-vere sanction includes the health worker's loss of licence), b) civil liability (that results in liability for compensation due to individual error which leads to a violation of pa-tient's rights) c) misdemeanor liability (which usually en-tail a fine for inflicting minor injuries) and d) criminal lia-bility (in cases where besides individual interests, it is nec-essary to ensure the protection of the wider social inter-est). However, despite this classification, the abovemen-tioned forms are mutually intertwined and complementa-ry to some extent, which means, whenever possible, it is necessary to avoid multiple punishments (Davitkovski et al., 2009). The health workers are not solely responsible for the damage caused by using different types of medical devic-es. The manufacturer or the importer, the health institution and the people in charge of the health institution, should also take legal liability.Civil liability is determined and accomplished by gen-eral legal rules liable for any caused damage. Above all, these are rules for personal liability, which is based on the guilt of the health worker and the liability rules of the le-gal entity (healthcare facility) for any damage caused by the employee to a third party. This liability arises as a con-sequence of violating contractual or legal duties of health professionals related to medical devices, and qualifies as a S2 PP 104226Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 225 - 226 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsmedical error. Nevertheless, the rules of objective liability (liability regardless of fault) are no exception in terms of rules of personal liability, but have a special scope of ap-plication that is defined by general terms such as: danger-ous object and dangerous activity. The rules of liability for dangerous objects or dangerous activities have their field of application, and in that context can be used in all cir-cumstances under which the damage is caused by the use of medical devices that have been labeled as dangerous ob-jects. Therefore, apart from health workers, the manufac-turer of the medical device and the holder of the dangerous object are also deemed as liable for the damage (Radisic, 2008). The compensation for the harm caused by medical devices is established in the Law on Obligations (Assem-bly of the Republic of Macedonia, 2001).Criminal liability of health professionals, legal entities and responsible persons in the legal entity is established in the Criminal Code, in the chapter - criminal violations of people's overall health are provided the following crimes: Unscrupulous treatment of the ill (Article 207), as well as manufacturing and using of harmful devices for treatment (Article 212), (Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia, 1996).Misdemeanor liability of the entities is established in Chapter VI Penalty Sanctions Law on Medicines and Medical Devices (Assembly of the Republic of Macedo-nia, 2007). Disciplinary liability of health workers stems from the codes of professional ethical duties and rights of health care workers, who make the respective chambers, and whose obligation for the Chambers derives from Arti-cle 250, Paragraph 3 of the Law on Health Protection (As-sembly of the Republic of Macedonia, 2012).The liability for the damage that may be caused by the use of medical devices is governed by several laws. The manufacturer or the importer of medical devices, the re-sponsible person in the legal person, public health officials and the health facility are deemed liable criminally, civilly, and disciplinary for the inflicted damage.ReferencesAssembly of the Republic of Macedonia, 1996.

Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* ageorgieva@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionRegulatory authorities FDA and ICH are encourag-ing and promoting implementation of Quality by Design (QbD) principles in the pharmaceutical industry environ-ment (ICH, 2008; ICH, 2009; Reid et al., 2013; Sangshet-ti et al., 2014). It is a current trend among pharmaceutical industry that a method development process is done by im-plementing an Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD), as a part of risk management, pharmaceutical development, and pharmaceutical quality system. The application of QbD concept to analytical method is justifiable, because of many variables that significantly affect the method results (Peraman et al., 2015).There is no single QbD approach to chromatographic method development. A systematic approach that is broad-ly-applicable includes the following steps: establishing the critical quality attributes (CQAs), creating an experimental design that includes screening and optimization, defining an operational design space and defining a control strategy (McBrien, 2010; Salman and Vinayak, 2014). Quality is guaranteed with robustness and reproduc-ibility of the method that with this approach is built in method development stage. Submission is based on prod-uct knowledge and assured by analytical target profile (ATP). Method flexibility, meaning allowed movement within method operable design region (MODR) and con-tinuous improvement that can be done without prior reg-ulatory approval, are one of the benefits that come along with this approach. Materials and methodsQbD approach for development of a high pressure re-versed phase liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for determination of impurities in a drug product that contains two active ingredients and five known impurities was per-formed. Several common critical parameters in HPLC - gra-dient time, pH of the aqueous eluent, type of organic modi-fier, temperature and stationary phase were evaluated with-in the quality by design framework by the means of comput-er modelling software Fusion AE. Agilent 1290 Infinity auto-mated method development system equipped with a column and solvent selection valves was used. As for initial chemis-try screening of our experiment setup, four different column chemistries were tested: Zorbax SB-CN, Zorbax Eclipse XDB-Phenyl, Zorbax Eclipse XDB-CN, and Zorbax Eclipse Plus Phenyl-Hexyl, to maximize selectivity. Five different pH levels of 50 mM ammonium formate buffer in a pH range of 3.5-5.5 were tested and two organic modifiers, acetoni-trile and methanol. Column temperature was varied in the in-terval 20-50 degC. Gradient time was set variable, from 28 to 30 minutes. As constant variables were set flow rate (0.7 ml/min), injection volume (20ul), initial and final hold time (2 and 10 minutes, respectively), initial and final hold percent organic (25 and 100 percent, respectivelly). An experimental design was converted in redy to run sequence with 62 chromatografic runs, along with columns equlibratin stages. We run the experiment and analyze the data. The experimental results were import back to Fusion AE and processed to generate an initial method for sub-sequent optimization. We set a specific goal for each re-sponse along with lower and upper acceptability limits for the solution search as follows: number of peaks - target 7, number of peaks that have USP resolution >= 1.50, target 6 and number of peaks that have USP Tailing <= 2.0, target 7. S2 PP 105228Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 227 - 228 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsResults and discussionAs stage one of our experiment based on QbD princi-ples, analytical target profile was defined. The goal of this analytical method development process was getting a ro-bust method for determination and quantification of relat-ed compounds of our drug product. The criteria for the suc-cessful separation (defined critical quality attribute) is tree fold: detection of all peak of interest, maximum critical resolution and USP tailing factor.The software carried out a number of solution search-es equal to the number of runs in the experiment design, with the specific goal settings of the experiment run as the starting point. The software then ranked the result of each search in terms of relative goodness (closeness to meeting or exceeding all goals). It then displayed the best overall answers in decreasing rank (LC Method Development Tu-torial, Fusion QbD Quality by Design Software, S-Matrix Corporation, 2014, Version 9.7). All parameters were stud-ied in combination, thus defining a multi-dimensional de-sign space. Fusion AE enable visualization of the effect of each factor on the separation. This visualization of the de-sign space was found very helpful in thorough understand-ing on the impact of each variable on method performanc-es (Monks et al., 2011). By changing the factors on each axis, the design space was explored in detail. Column Zor-bax SB-CN and acetonitrile were found to be optimal, as the acceptable performance region for these variables was found to be the broadest. The initial method was further optimized in experiment where secondary effectors such as column temperature, initial gradient slope and strong sol-vent percent and flow rate were varied. After processing the results, the final optimized method was generated. ConclusionHPLC analytical procedure for related and degrada-tion products in new pharmaceutical product was devel-oped, using the AQbD approach. Column Zorbax SB-CN, 50 mM ammonium formate buffer pH 4.5 as weak and ace-tonitrile as strong solvent in a gradient time of 28 minutes and column temperature of 20 degC were established as in-put variables that fulfil the goals set at the very beginning, thus defining a well-known and understandable multi-di-mensional method operable design region. This kind of approach to analytical method develop-ment gave us better understanding of method variables, since they were studied in combination. Given the large amount of chromatographic information contained in gen-erated models, these offer a sound foundation for method troubleshooting and to justify continuous future improve-ment.An automated method development using Fusion AE software take less time compared to manual method de-velopment, but also requires a huge understanding in se-lection of input variables and output response. QbD means the right analysis at the right time, based on science and risk assessment. This way of understanding and practic-ing the AQbD is current area of focus and needs to be im-plemented.ReferencesInternational conference on harmonization of technical Requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use (ICH), 2008.
