A num-ber of chromatographic methods such as: thin-layer chro-matography (TLC) (Hancu et al., 2011), gas chromatog-raphy and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (Kudi et al., 1988) have been used in the analysis of DZP and other 1,4-benzodiazopines. Several high-perfor-mance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods have also been reported for the determination of diazepam and oth-er BZDs (Magalhaes et al., 2012; Moros et al., 2007). Ben-zyl alcohol (BA) is used as an antimicrobial preservative in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products and its concen-tration should not exceed limit values for each formulation type because it could produce fatal toxic effects, allergies and various other effects on the nervous system (Martin-dale, 2009). Benzyl alcohol is quantitatively estimated in raw material and pharmaceutical preparations by gas chro-matography, derivative spectrophotometry, HPLC, am-perometric enzyme electrode, polarography des and cap-illary electrokinetic chromatography (Khade et al., 2014; Sen, 2011). To the best of our knowledge no analytical method is available for the simultaneous determination of DZP and BA in pharmaceutical preparations. Therefore, it was considered necessary to develop a HPLC method for the quantification of these compounds in pharmaceutical dosage forms. We wish to describe a simple, rapid, eco-nomical and accurate method of analysis using reversed-phase HPLC to simultaneously determine DZP and BA in microclismes.Materials and methodsThe chromatographic analysis was performed using DionexUltiMate 3000 UHPLC focused. The HPLC grade acetonitrile was developed using ReproSil-Pur 120 C4, 150 x 4,6 mm, 3,0 um chromatographic column with mobile phase containing a mixture of 0.1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid in water and acetonitrile in the ratio of 70:30 v/v, re-spectively. Isocratic method was used with runtime of 10 minute. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.5 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 35degC and the eluted compounds were monitored at the wavelength of 254 nm. The injection volume was 20 mL. A standards stock solution of DZP and BA were prepared in metha-nol with a concentration of 2 mg/mL and 0.015 mL/mL. Working standard solutions were prepared from stock so-lutions by further dilution with water. The sample solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mL solution of microclisme in a 50 mL volumetric flask (US bath for 7 min) and dilut-ing with water to volume. The sample solution was filtered through a 0.45 um PTFE membrane filter.Results and discussionThe proposed method was validated as per ICH guide-line (ICH, 2003). The following validation characteristics were addressed: suitability, specificity, precision, lineari-ty, accuracy, and robustness.System suitability was checked for the conformance of suitability and reproducibility of chromatographic sys-S2 PP 91200Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 199 - 200 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationstem for analysis. The system suitability was evaluated on the basis of USP capacity factor, tailing factor and theo-retical plates of DZ and BA and relative standard devia-tion (RSD) of six injections of standard solution. Sys-tem suitability was determined before sample analysis. The acceptance criteria were % RSD should not be more than 2.0%, USP tailing factor should less than 2.0 and the-oretical plate should be more than 3000 for DZ and BA peak from standard solutions. All critical parameters test-ed met the acceptance criteria [kDZ'=5.35 kBA'=1.14, AsDZP=1.4 and AsBA=1.1, NDZP=4800 and NBA=4253, RSDDZP=0.001 and RSDBA=0.0017). Specificity study to establish the interference of placebo was conducted. Study was performed on Placebo (Placebo contains excipi-ents without DZP and BA). Chromatogram of placebo had shown no peaks at the retention time of DZP and BA, indi-cating that the excipients used in the formulation do not in-terferewith the estimation of DZP and BA. The precision of the method was verified by repeatability and intermediate precision at three concentration levels (DZP: 0.017 mg/mL to 0.023 mg/mL and BA: 0.118 uL/mL to 0.162 uL/mL). The intermediate precision of the method was also evaluat-ed using different analyst and different instrument and per-forming the analysis on different days. The RSD (%) of re-sult for DZP and BA was calculated. The % RSD for the result of DZP in was within 0.65% and in intermediate pre-cision study was within 0.28%, The % RSD for the result of BA in was within 0.63% and in intermediate precision study was within 0.29%, which confirms the good preci-sion of the method. Linearity test solutions were prepared by diluting the stock solutions to the required concentra-tions by covering the range from 0.014 to 0.026 mg/mL of DZP and 0.098 to 0.182 uL/mL of BA. Calibration curves were plotted between the responses of peak versus ana-lyte concentrations. The correlation coefficient obtained was greater than 0.999 (for DZP is 0.9995 and for BA is 0.9992). The above result shows that an excellent correla-tion existed between peak area and concentration of DZP and BA. Accuracy of the method was evaluated in triplicate using three concentrations levels (80%, 100% and 120%) and confirmed by calculated recovery values. The percent-age recoveries for DZP and BA were calculated and varied from 98.76 to 101.50 for DZP and from 98.15 to 101.96 for BA. To determine the robustness of the developed method, experimental conditions were deliberately altered and sys-tem suitability (SST) parameters for DZP and BA standard were recorded. The variables evaluated during the robust-ness testing were: composition of the mobile phase, col-umn temperature and flow rate. The obtained results have shown that the method is robust for experimental variation of composition of the mobile phase and column tempera-ture, but it is not robust for the change of the flow rate. Re-covery value lies in the proper range of from 95% to 105%, ie. RSD does not deviate by more than +- 5% (RSD=0.64% for diazepam, RSD=0.49% of benzyl alcohol). ConclusionA simple and efficient reverse-phase HPLC meth-od was developed and validated for quantitative analy-sis of DZP and BA inmicroclisme as pharmaceutical dos-age forms. The method found to be precise, accurate, lin-ear, robust and rugged during validation. The method could be used for routine analysis of production samples and to check the stability of the DZ and BA.ReferencesCudina, O.A., Comor, M.I., Jankovic, I.A., 2005.

Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia2 Faculty of Pharmacy, University of "Ss. Cyril and Methodius", Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* vpetrusevski@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionDeveloping GC-MS methods for chemical character-ization of pharmaceutical packaging materials presents significant challenge, since the sheer number of additives and their degradation products that can be found in packag-ing materials and subsequently separated and detected with this technique is enormous (Jenke, 2009). These methods need to be capable of simultaneous separation and detec-tion of aliphatic fatty acids, alcohols, amides and their de-rivatives, compounds that are traditionally difficult to sep-arate and detect, due to the large similarity in structure and their physico-chemical properties.The aim of this paper was to develop a GC method for chemical characterization of semi-volatile additives and their degradation products in packaging materials for phar-maceutical use.The GC method was developed using a commercial-ly available system suitability mixture (Grob Test Mix), containing 11 compounds that belong to different chemi-cal groups of compounds, which was suitable for the in-tended approach to develop a method that will be simulta-neously capable of separation of different groups of pack-aging additives.Materials and methodsDevelopment was made using Grob DA 280 Column Test Mix (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, USA). The mixture is composed of 11 compounds (n-Decane (C10), Methyl dec-anoate (C10:0), n-Undecane (C11), Methyl undecanoate (C11:0), Methyl dodecanoate (C12:0), L(+)-2,3-Butanedi-ol, 2,6-Dimethylaniline, 2,6-Dimethylphenol, 2-Ethylhex-anoic acid, Nonanal and 1-Octanol), dissolved in methy-lene chloride (DCM). All experiments were performed on Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus gas chromatograph and Agilent 7890B gas chro-matograph equipped with Agilent 5977A single quadru-pole mass spectrometer. MS identification of the detected compounds was performed by AMDIS spectral deconvo-lution and comparison of spectra with NIST library, using MassHunter software. For those compounds where library match was low, attempts to establish compound's identity were made via mechanistic fragment predictions of avail-able spectral data, using MassFrontier v7.0 software.Results and discussionThe development of the chromatographic conditions started using a non-polar GC WCOT chromatographic col-umn (Agilent DB-5 ms; 30m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 mm), with helium as carrier gas at 2 ml/min (constant velocity, which has the advantage over constant pressure mode toward the end of the run, where increase in temperature would other-wise drastically reduce the flow, leading to prolonged run-time and reduced sensitivity because of decrease of col-umn efficiency). The following temperature gradient con-ditions were chosen for initial separation of the Grob Test Mix: 40 degS (hold 2 minutes), 10 degS/min to 330 degS (hold 10 minutes), injector temperature was set at 250 degS and injec-tion volume of 1 uL with split ratio of 1:10. Evaluation of the chromatograms quickly revealed that the method con-ditions aren't capable of separating the mixture, with mul-tiple co-elutions observed.In order to achieve specificity of the method, optimi-S2 PP 92202Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 201 - 202 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationszation of the conditions by variation of the carrier gas flow and temperature gradient was attempted. Besides the im-provement in the separation of the components, is was found to be impossible to separate two critical pairs of compounds (n-undecane and n-nonanal; 2,6-dimethylphe-nol and 2-ethylhexanoic acid), even with extreme gradi-ent changes.A change in the stationary phase chemistry was the next logical step, therefore the Agilent DB-5 column was replaced with a non-polar Rxi-1 column (Rxi-1 MS 30m x 0.25mm x 0.25mm, Restek Corp., Bellefonte, USA), with the idea to promote different interactions between the sta-tionary phase and the components from the critical pairs. The change in column chemistry proved to be successful, and minor changes to the temperature gradient conditions yielded complete baseline separation of all components from the Grob DA 280 Column Test Mix. The final chro-matographic conditions were defined as: flow: 2 ml/min (constant flow); temperature gradient: 60 degS (hold 2 min-utes), 10 degS/min to 80 degS (hold 2 minutes), 3 degS/min to 100 degS, 25 degS/min to 310 degS (hold 10 minutes); injection vol-ume: 1 uL; split ratio: 1:5. The injector temperature was in-creased to 310 degS to obtain faster evaporation of the sam-ple, better sensitivity and reduced peak width.Besides the components from Grob DA 280 Column Test Mix, stearic acid and erucamide (cis-13 docosen-amide) were chromatographically evaluated, and proved to be completely separated from the rest of the components from the Grob DA 280 Column Test Mix. These two com-pounds were evaluated not only because they are frequent-ly used additives in the packaging materials, but also be-cause they are candidate molecules for derivatization in gas chromatography.Detection of the separated components was simulta-neously performed with FID and MS detector using post-column splitter valve, in accordance with PQRI's recom-mendations (PQRI Leachables and Extractables Working Group 2006) to reduce the chances of missing an extracted compound, due to detector type specificities.Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) plastics were evaluated by generating a number of ex-tracts in water buffers, methanol and hexane and analyzed using the proposed method. Both detectors showed equiv-alent responses (as a number of detected compounds), us-ing their default parameters, with the methanol and hexane extracts showing highest numbers of detected components of all extracts.ConclusionGas chromatography is extremely important technique for analysis of extractables and leachables, due to the fact that it enables efficient separation and detection of an enor-mous number of organic compounds commonly encoun-tered in packaging materials. Coupling gas chromatogra-phy with MS detection further enhances its capabilities to-ward identification of the detected compounds, giving a clearer picture of the additives profile of the tested mate-rial.ReferencesJenke, D., 2009.
