The between -day accuracy and precision was within the range from 99.00 -109.26% with a CV of 2.11 - 8.34%. The mean extraction recovery of DOX from saliva samples (96.13-98.5%) con-firmed an efficient extraction procedure. Stability testing showed that GCF and saliva samples are stable after three freeze-thaw cycles, after 12 hours in the autosampler, 24 hours at room temperature and one month at - 20 @C. The validated method was applied for determination of DOX concentrations in GCF and saliva samples from periodontitis patients. DOX concentrations in GCF sam-ples for group I on day 7, 15 and 21 reached 2.24 +-0.32 mg/mL, 1.68 +- 0.19 mg/mL and 1.39 +- 0.17 mg/mL, respective-ly. The DOX concentration in saliva samples for the select-ed time points were 0.19 +- 0.03 mg/mL, 0.07 +- 0.01 mg/mL and 0.04 +- 0.01 mg/mL. For group II, DOX concentrations in GCF samples on day 15, 30 and 60 were 1.72 +- 0.29 mg/mL, 1.67 +- 0.33 mg/mL and 1.38 +- 0.12 mg/mL, respectively. For saliva sam-ples, DOX concentrations on day 15, 30 and 60 were 0.71 +- 0.10 mg/mL, 0.88 +- 0.22 mg/mL and 0.31+- 0.07 mg/mL, re-spectively. As it can be seen from the results, the determined DOX concentrations in GCF are much higher compared to those in saliva which is consistent with the fact that gingival fibroblasts act as reservoirs of this drug (Lavda et al., 2004).ConclusionThe data presented in this study indicate that the pro-posed method used for determination of DOX in GCF and saliva samples showed satisfactory selectivity, linearity, accuracy and precision. The method is therefore suitable and applicable for the analysis of DOX in GCF and saliva samples in patients undergoing conventional or SDD peri-odontal therapy.

Given the complexity of the blood as an extraction medium, matrix effect (ME) is the most critical aspect in the method development. For these rea-sons, particular attention should be paid during the opti-mization of the extraction procedure. There are several re-ported LLE procedures for extraction of indapamide us-ing HPLC-UV or MS detection (Hang et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2005; Zendelovska et al., 2003). However they did not meet the expectations concerning the modern bioanalytical challenges towards sample preparation. In our previous-ly published research, automated SPE-LC-MS/MS meth-od for determination of indapamide in blood was devel-oped (Nakov et al., 2013). Given the automation of the ex-traction procedure, the method resulted in low matrix ef-fect and great performance consistency. Taking into con-sidering that this type of equipment is not very disseminat-ed across the laboratories, optimization of low matrix LLE was acceded. The effectiveness of the LLE procedure in remov-ing ME depends on the choice of a suitable organic sol-vent, because various organic solvents can remove differ-ent classes of phospholipids. Since the phospholipids are the main class of endogenous components responsible for the ME, monitoring of the specific phospholipids mass transitions was used as a tool for targeted optimization of the LLE procedure for indapamide extraction from human whole blood. Materials and methodsThe blood samples (0.5 mL) were spiked with 50 mL zolpidem tartarate (internal standards, IS) working solu-tion of 300 ng/mL, 1 mL 5% ZnSO4 and 1 mL 100 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6.8). The samples were vortex-mixed for 2 min and 1 mL organic solvent was added. The extraction was performed by vortex-mixing for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min, the upper or-ganic layer was transferred to another tube and evaporated in vacuum centrifuge for 60 min. The dried residues were dissolved in 1 mL methanol and 10 uL were injected into the LC-MS/MS system. The experiments were performed on Shimadzu LCMS 8030 triple quadrupole mass spec-trometer in positive ESI mode, using Kinetex C18 (100 x 2.1mm, 1.7um particle size) chromatographic column. Mobile phase was consisted of a mixture of 2 mM ammo-nium acetate (added 0.5 mL formic acid in 1L buffer) and acetonitrile in ratio 10:90. Analyses were conducted at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Positive precursor ion scan m/z 184 was used for phospholipids monitoring. Indapamide and IS were quantified in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) using the transition of m/z 366.1-132.15 and m/z 309.0-236.10, respectively. Results and discussionThe procedure of monitoring specific mass transitions of phospholipids (precursor ions scan of m/z 184) provides information about all precursor ions that fragment to tri-methylammonium-ethyl phosphate ion (m/z 184), allow-ing detection of all phosphatidylcholine phospholipids, ly-sophospholipids and sphingomyelins. This procedure was used for identification of the class of phospholipids pres-S2 PP 84186Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 185 - 186 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsent in blood extracts and selection of an appropriate ex-traction solvent for LLE of indapamide. Two nonpolar (di-ethyl ether; mixture of n-hexane and dichloromethane) and two polar (5% MTBE in NH4OH and MTBE) extraction solvents were evaluated for elimination of ME and extrac-tion recovery during the optimization of the LLE proce-dure. Post-extraction experiments were conducted to de-termine the degree of ME. The absolute ME was assessed from the responses obtained from blood extract containing indapamide added after the LLE and same concentration of indapamide added to neat solution. The post-extraction experiments showed that the nonpolar solvents gave high ME (30%). Intense peaks in the region from 1.5 - 4 min were found in the total ion chromatogram (TIC) of pre-cursor ions scan of m/z 184. Several precursor ions (m/z 496, m/z 520 and m/z 512) were detected in both blood extracts using nonpolar extraction solvents. These precur-sor ions indicated the presence of lysophospholipids. Ly-sophospholipids belong to the class of early-eluting phos-pholipids and given the short retention time of indapamide (1.55 min), it was evident that this class of phospholipids was responsible for the ME. The literature data showed that polar organic solvent are more effective in lysophospholipids removal (Cham-bers et al., 2007). Therefore, the subsequent experiments towards LLE optimization were conducted using more po-lar extraction solvents (alkaline MTBE and MTBE). The TIC of precursor ions scan of m/z 184 obtained from blood extract after LLE with alkaline MTBE, also showed pres-ents of lysophospholipids. The absolute ME was reduced from 30% to 63.6%. However, if we consider the ME (91%) obtained using the automated SPE procedure (Na-kov et al., 2013); the obtained result was still unsatisfac-tory. In addition, the extraction recovery was low (around 62%). The use of MTBE resulted in significant removal of lysophospholipids, which was confirmed with the phos-pholipids monitoring. The phospholipids signals obtained during the precursor ions scan of m/z 184 were with low intensity, which coincided with the post-extraction experi-ments. The ME obtained using MTBE as extraction solvent was 90.4%, suggesting that removal of the ME from com-plex biological material such as whole blood was achieved. The recovery of indapamide was found to be around 77% and the coefficient of variation of the LLE procedure was around 5%, thus confirming the acceptable repeatability.ConclusionIn this research, it was found that MTBE is effective solvent for lysophospholipids removal from human blood, thus leading to elimination of ME during the LLE of indap-amide. The monitoring of specific mass transitions of phos-pholipids, as well as the post-extraction experiments, con-firmed that the optimized LLE yields clean extract same as the automated SPE, thus it could be used for extraction of indapamide from human blood during the pharmacokinet-ic and bioequivalent studies.ReferencesChambers, E., Wagrowski-Diehl, D.M., Lu, Z., Mazzeo, J.R., 2007.

Cyril and Methodius University, Ruger Boskovic 16, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* vdubrova@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionLately, the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) for extending the shelf life of the pharmaceutical products has been gaining more actualization and application, particu-larly in the pharmaceutical industry (Lyon et al., 2000).Data used for the statistical evaluation are collect-ed from the examined parameters indicating the impact of the storage conditions on the quality, safety and efficacy of the product defined in the shelf life specification during the monitoring of the long-term stability of a final pharmaceu-tical product (Yoshioka and Stella, 2000). After comple-tion of the stability studies the results are evaluated in ac-cordance with the regulation (ICH, 2003a).The goal of this paper was to explore the possibility of shelf life extension based on statistical evaluation of stabil-ity data of ongoing stability studies for final pharmaceuti-cal product, Lisinopril tablets of 10mg, that contain active substances from different manufacturers, both with Euro-pean quality certification (EDQM, 2015).Materials and methodsThe investigated batches of final pharmaceutical product, Lisinopril tablets 10 mg, with incorporated active substanc-es from two different manufacturers, were examined over fol-lowing stability indicating parameters: content of active sub-stance, release of the active substance, related and degrada-tion products and organoleptic characteristics (Diana, 2008).Samples used in studies of stability are kept in stabili-ty chambers, with strictly defined and controlled monitor-ing of temperature and relative humidity (DC +- 2 degC, DRH +- 5%) with the software system Sympati (ICH, 2003a). F-test method and analysis of variance (ANOVA) have been applied to the obtained analytical data in order to determine whether there are statistically significant differenc-es between the batches in which the active substance is built from different manufacturers, or whether the quality of the active substance from various manufacturers affects the qual-ity of the final product and the variation of the tested param-eters (O'Brien, 1979). The interdependence between the re-sults obtained with the long-term stability tests to 36 months is determined by using regression analysis. Regression anal-ysis of the dependence of the tested parameters from the time of examination is performed by logarithmic regression, as a kind of curve that best corresponds to the nature of the re-sults. Non-linear, i.e. logarithmic regression more suitably reflects the actual connection between the examination time and tested parameters, i.e. the content and release of the ac-tive substance. Based on the equation, the desired shelf life is provided and it is compared with the experimentally obtained value of the parameters tested for 48 months.Results and discussionEvaluation of the results of stability study within the pre-scribed period of useThe calculated F-value is 1.89 for the content of the active substance, i.e. 1.68 for the release of the active sub-S2 PP 85188Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 187 - 188 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsstance, which is a value lower than the tabular F-value = 19.0 on 2 degrees of freedom and statistical confidence of 99.0%, which means that there is no statistically signifi-cant difference between the variability of the content of the active substance and the release of the active substance in the tested batches of different manufacturers of the active substance.According the Analysis of the variance, F-test value (p = 0.968 > 0.05 and p = 0.847 > 0.05), it can be conclud-ed that among the average values of the content and re-lease of the active substance in Lisinopril tablets 10 mg of both manufacturers there is no statistically significant dif-ference.Evaluation of the results of extended stability studiesThe results obtained by determining the content of the active substance during long-term stability tests are incor-porated in the logarithmic regression curve, from which extrapolating theoretical values for the content of the ac-tive substance are derived for the new proposed shelf life of 48 months. The same examined samples of batches of Lisinopril 10 mg tablets are left in the room for stabili-ty under the same conditions for another 12 months, in to-tal 48 months.By extrapolating the logarithmic regression curve the-oretical values for the content of the active substance in Lisinopril tablets 10 mg are obtained after 48 months, with an interval of reliability at a statistical confidence of 95% and compared with the experimental values obtained.
