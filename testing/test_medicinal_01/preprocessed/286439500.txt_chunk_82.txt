It may induceapoptosis in both intrinsic and extrinsic ways in cancercells (Zareba and Palka, 2016). Unfortunately, the enzymeis often down-regulated in cancer cells leading to inhibitedapoptosis (Kononczuk et al., 2015a). Our results indicatedalmost undetectable expression of PRODH/POX in CAL-27cells. Therefore, we analyzed propolis compounds as factorsinducing PRODH/POX expression and decreasing proline level.We suggest that polyphenols contained in propolis induced theenzyme activity, leading to induction of apoptosis in CAL-27cells.We found that studied polyphenols decreased in a dose-dependent manner the viability of CAL-27 cells. Moreover,the treatment inhibited DNA biosynthesis in these cells. Thedecrease in cell number was related to induction of apoptosis.We observed a significant increase in expression of active/cleavedcaspases -3 and -9 and increase in the amount of the cells withlow level of reduced glutathione (GSH) in polyphenol-treatedCAL-27 cells. Considering the important role of PRODH/POXin apoptosis (Phang, 2017), its expression was evaluated. Thepolyphenols induced expression of PRODH/POX in CAL-27cells. Cell growth arrest related to apoptosis is induced byp53. The transcription factor is the most potent inducer ofPRODH/POX expression (Nagano et al., 2017). In fact, p53expression was also induced by studied polyphenols in SCCcells.PRODH/POX-dependent utilization of proline in polyphenol-treated CAL-27 cells was confirmed by LC-MS analysis ofproline concentration. Since proline could be utilized incollagen, the biosynthesis of this protein was determined.All tested compounds significantly inhibited the process. Itsuggests that observed decrease in proline concentration wasrelated to its metabolism by PRODH/POX. The decreaseof collagen biosynthesis in polyphenol-treated CAL-27 cellsmay result from inhibition of prolidase by polyphenols. Theenzyme plays an important role in collagen biosynthesis(Palka and Phang, 1997; Surazynski et al., 2008b; Kononczuket al., 2015a). We observed inhibition of prolidase activityin the cells treated with studied compounds (however tovarious degree). We suggest, that decrease in proline levelby propolis compounds result from proline degradationin mitochondria by induced PRODH/POX and not byutilization of this amino acid for collagen biosynthesis. Thesignificant role of PRODH/POX in apoptosis induction wedescribed previously (Kononczuk et al., 2015b). Stimulationof PRODH/POX expression by Eptifibatide, aIIbb3-integrininhibitor, lead to strong proapoptotic effect in MCF-7 breastcancer cells.The present study provides for the first time evidence thatcompounds of propolis (chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid,and ferulic acid, of which the most potential effect on CAL-27 cells growth inhibition was attributed to chrysin) contributeto the induction of PRODH/POX-dependent apoptosis inCAL-27 cells. Therefore, PRODH/POX may represent a noveltarget for the propolis-induced anticancer activity in SCCcells.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSKC-J, UL, and WM: conceived and designed the experiments.KC-J, IZ, and JT: performed the experiments.
