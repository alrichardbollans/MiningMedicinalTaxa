Are medicines any safer now?Kevin O'Donnell Health Products Regulatory Authority, Kevin O'Malley House, Earlsfort Centre, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, Ireland* kevin.odonnell@hpra.ieBackground - ten years of QRM developmentsOver the past ten years, since the finalisation of the ICH guideline titled Quality Risk Management, ICH Q9, there have been significant efforts by industry and regula-tors to drive risk-based approaches forward. This has in-cluded initiatives by regulators to update the GMPs and other official guidance documents to incorporate increased provisions relating to risk and its management (Campbell et al., 2016; European Commission, 2010; O'Donnell et al., 2012). There have also been many industry-led pub-lications, guides and technical reports, offering practical guidance for how to implement the concepts of QRM in the GMP environment (Calnan et al., 2013; Vesper et al., 2006).However, the question remains as to whether the man-agement of risk in relation to the production of defective and sub-standard medicines has significantly improved in these last ten years, and whether, from a product quality perspective, medicines are any safer now than they were before the ICH Q9 guideline was introduced. While there are many different areas one could study when consider-ing the question of medicines safety, such as pharmaco-vigilance, Marketing Authorisation withdrawals and drug shortages, to name but a few, the focus of this presenta-tion is on GMP, and specifically on product quality con-siderations.Looking for the added value for patientsThe presentation discusses how, while the aforemen-tioned QRM initiatives had product quality and patient safety as their overall focus, many of the product quality and compliance issues occurring before 2005 are still with us, and the evidence indicates that certain types of prob-lems are increasing (Waldron et al., 2015). Some of these relate to:* Serious quality defects and product recalls continuing to occur globally;* Market Authorisation non-compliance issues some-times resulting in the cessation of batch release;* Product shortages as a result of serious GMP failures.QRM and risk assessment inspection deficienciesIn relation to serious quality defect issues, the presen-tation explores that various factors that may have led to the level of those issues seen in the last ten years - and how formal research projects are currently underway in Ireland and at the European Medicines Agency to better understand this area. Of concern is the fact that most of these defective batches were manufactured using qualified equipment, trained staff, and validated manufacturing pro-cesses, and this leads one to question what is happening. The paper considers:* Whether the manufacturing and control processes cur-rently in place have been properly risk assessed and de-signed using QRM principles. * Whether qualification and validation activities were ac-tually based on risk, as required by Annex 15 of the EU GMPs. If so, why are defective batches of medicines still being produced, with the same kind of defects over and over - product contamination, mix-ups, labelling errors, etc.? * What areas need most attention in the QRM activities at manufacturing sites?

These relate to the lack of good sci-ence, robustness and rigour in many of risk assessment and QRM-related activities taking place currently. The presen-tation presents a series of brief real-life case study exam-ples showing some of the inspectional deficiencies that the HPRA has cited in recent years in these areas, and it also presents a number of suggestions and ideas for how to im-prove QRM activities in the GMP environment.

As a key person in the company, the Qualified Person has to consider many issues and has to take up the challenges within its areas of responsibilities. The previous year 2015 was an eventful year. Again there were new developments in the Good Manufacturing Practice environment as well as announcements of changes that preoccupied the phar-maceutical industry. 2016 won't be less exciting, also be-cause now many of the new requirements must be imple-mented:* Excipients - Formalized Risk Assessment, EMA Guideline, "... on the formalized risk assessment for ascertaining the appropriate good manufac-turing practice for excipients of medicinal prod-ucts for human use", In operation from 21.

A comprehensively designed Pharmaceutical Quali-ty System (PQS) incorporating Good Manufacturing Prac-tice (GMP) and Quality Risk Management (QRM), imple-mented, maintained and continuously improved, allows a consistent delivery of products with appropriate quality at-tributes. The level of GMP, is regularly checked by com-petent authorities, authorized with a GMP Certificate, and it is a basis for maintenance of Marketing Authorization (MA) and marketing of medicinal products within the EC/EEA (CE, 2001; CE, 2003). The results of product and processes monitoring are taken into account during batch certification, having into consideration deviations or OOS, OOT or OOE (if any) by implementing QRM. (EudraLex, 2016; ICH, 2005). The Qualified Person is responsible for ensuring that each individual batch has been manufactured and checked in compliance with laws in force, in accordance with the requirements of the marketing authorisation (MA) and with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) (CE, 2001; Eu-draLex, 2016).When the batch is intended to be sold in the EU, in the new annex is clear on this: "Samples may either be tak-en after arrival in the EU, or be taken at the manufactur-ing site in the third country in accordance with a technical-S2 OP 54126Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 125 - 126 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsOral presentationsly justified approach which is documented within the com-pany's quality system. Any samples taken outside the EU should be shipped under equivalent transport conditions as the batch that they represent (EudraLex, 2016).Marketing authorizations require a QP declaration (issued by the Qualified Person) to confirm that the ac-tive substance (active pharmaceutical ingredient - API) has been manufactured in accordance with the EU-GMP Guide, Part II: Basic Requirements for Active Substanc-es used as Starting Materials. The QP declaration template provides, in a format considered suitable for submission, a basis for demonstrating compliance of the active substance manufacture with GMP requirements, based on audit on site(s) and that the manufacturer has relevant knowledge of the supply chain (EMA, 2014). Relying on assessment by third parties, e.g. audits, should be in accordance with Chapter 7 of the GMP Guide in order to appropriately define, agree and control any out-sourced activity. Special focus should be given to the ap-proval of the audit reports (CE, 2003). A signed Quality or Technical Agreement(s) between all parties involved in the supply chain, have to be in place, including manufacturers of the starting materials, in bulk and finished products manufacturers, batch control test-ing laboratories, importation and batch certification and release site(s), transportation and distribution. The entire supply chain of the active substance and medicinal product up to the stage of certification is documented and available for the QP. This should include the manufacturing sites of the starting materials and packaging materials for the me-dicinal product and any other materials deemed critical through a risk assessment of the manufacturing process. The document should preferably be in the format of a com-prehensive diagram, where each party, including subcon-tractors of critical steps are included (CE, 2003, EudraL-ex, 2016).

Courtaboeuf, 91970 Les Ulis, France* gregory.lecornet@agilent.comIntroductionThe presence of impurities in pharmaceutical samples is a concern, not only because some contaminants are inherently toxic, but also because they may adversely affect drug stability and shelf-life, or may cause unwanted side-effects. As a result, inorganic elemental impurities (As, Pb, Cd, Hg,...) must be monitored and controlled in raw materials, including: water, used for drug manufacturing; intermediates; active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs); excipients and in the final dosage form. ICH, which includes the regulatory bodies from the US, Europe and Japan, as well as representatives from other countries and the pharmaceutical industry, has defined a Guideline for Elemental Impurities (Q3D) due to be implemented in December 2017 (Liba et al., 2011).The new methods will introduce the use of closed vessel sample digestion and modern instrumental techniques (ICP-AES, ICP-MS) to ensure the accurate recovery and determination of individual analyte (McCurdy et al., 2004)Material and methodsAn Agilent 7800 ICP-MS with Octopole Reaction System (ORS4) fitted with a low-flow concentric quartz nebulizer was used for all measurements. The objective was to use the ICP-MS to determine a full range of elements. The ORS4 was operated in helium collision mode (He mode) only, which is effective at removing a wide range of plasma and matrix-based polyatomic species using kinetic energy discrimination (KED). Because He mode does not react with any analyte, and does not create any new interferences, elements that do not suffer from polyatomic interferences were also analyzed using He modeReagents and materialsHNO3 (BASF); ultrapure water (18.2 MO) produced by Milli-Q ultrapure water systems; 100 g/mL of multi element internal standard solution containing 6Li, Sc, Ge, Rh, In, Tb, Lu and Bi (Agilent Part # 5188-6525); multi-element calibration standard STD-2A solution (Agilent Part # 8500-6940)Results and discussionIn this study, we investigated the use of collision cell technology using helium gas to eliminate interferences generated by the plasma and the sample matrix.
