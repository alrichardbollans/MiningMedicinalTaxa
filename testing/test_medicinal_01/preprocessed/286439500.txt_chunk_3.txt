Centaurea ragusina L. Isolates' Bioactivitymonolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium(DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with 10% (FBS;Sigma-Aldrich) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37*Cand were sub-cultured every 3-4 days. Cytotoxic activity of theSTL 5 was determined by MTT assay, an assay for assessing cellviability based on its metabolic activity, modified accordingly(Mickisch et al., 1990; also in Supplementary Material).Cell Cycle and Cell Death AnalysisHeLa cells were seeded into tissue culture plates and treatedwith different concentrations of the compound during 72 h.Thereafter, both adherent and floating cells were collected,washed with PBS and fixed overnight in 70% ethanol at -20*C. Fixed cells were treated with RNase A (0.1 mg/mL,Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature and afterwardstained with propidium iodide (PI; 50 ug/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) for30 min in the dark. In order to analyze the cell cycle progression,the DNA content and PI staining were detected by flow cytometry(FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, United States).Data were analyzed with ModFit LTTM program (Verity SoftwareHouse Inc., Topsham, ME, United States).Twenty-four hours after the seeding, HeLa cells were treatedwith 2, 5, and 10 uM of compound 5. After 48 h, bothadherent and floating cells were collected by centrifugation andthen washed with PBS. The cell suspension was incubated withAnnexin V (BD Biosciences; according to producer's protocol)and PI (5 ug/mL, Sigma-Aldrich). Upon 30 min incubation atroom temperature in the dark, the viable, early apoptotic, lateapoptotic/necrotic, and necrotic cell populations were detectedand counted by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Data wereanalyzed with ModFit LTTM program (Verity Software HouseInc. ).In addition, the specific markers of programmed cell deathwere determined, cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1(PARP) and caspase-3, by western blot as described previously(Brozovic et al., 2013). In short, the 2 h incubation atroom temperature with monoclonal anti-PARP (Santa CruzBiotechnology) and polyclonal anti-caspase-3 (anti-Cas-3;Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, United States)antibodies was performed. After washing with 0.01% Tween20 in PBS and incubation with the corresponding horseradishperoxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham PharmaciaBiotech, Munich, Germany), proteins were visualized withECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to themanufacturer's protocol. All membranes were incubated withanti-extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (anti-ERK1/2)(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody to confirm equal proteinloading. ERK1/2 was used as loading controls since no changesin total ERK1/2 expression were detected upon exposure ofcells to different drugs (Brozovic et al., 2004; Herraiz et al.,2011).Determination of Glutathione FunctionThe function of intracellular GSH in cell response to STL 5was investigated by MTT assay. HeLa cells were either pre-treated overnight with a specific inhibitor, 0.001 mM BSO orfor 2 h with a precursor in GSH synthesis, 5 mM NAC. Bothcompounds are frequently used in the manipulation of GSHlevel in the cells (Trachootham et al., 2009; Kannan et al.,2014). Upon pre-treatment with either BSO or NAC, differentconcentrations of STL 5 were added and the cytotoxicity effectof the compounds was determined 72 h later as describedabove.The capacity of GSH to form the detoxification conjugatesthrough enzymatic reaction with STL 5 was investigated bypretreatment of HeLa cells with of 5 ug/mL ETA for 2 h andthen with different concentrations of STL 5. The cell survivalwas examined 72 h after. The optimal concentrations of usedmodulators of GSH synthesis and glutathione S-transferasereaction were determined previously (Osmak and Eljuga, 1993;Brozovic et al., 2008; Brozovic et al., 2013).Statistical AnalysisAll results were evaluated using the software package Statistica12.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, United States). Results were subjectedto one-way ANOVA for comparison of means and significantdifferences were calculated according to Duncan's multiple rangetest. Data were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.Different letters indicate significant difference at P < 0.05.RESULTSSelection of Plant Material, Extraction,Fractionation, and First BioactivityAssessmentAs a starting point for phytochemical investigations, an ethanolC. ragusina L. leaf extract (CRE) was prepared to obtain amulticomponent mixture embracing a wide range of secondarymetabolites (Figure 1).In antibacterial assays, CRE showed moderate antibacterialeffects against S. aureus with MIC of 500 ug/mL and MBC of2000ug/mL, respectively, and weak activity against A. baumanniiwith MIC and MBC values both of > 4000 ug/mL, respectively(VujcVic' et al., 2017).In contrast to the moderate antibacterial activity, CREexhibited significant effects on all tested murine melanoma(B16F10), squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) fibrosarcoma(FsaR) cell lines and normal hamster fibroblasts (V79).At a CRE concentration of 60 ug/mL, the cell survivalrelative to the negative control was <= 10% for V79 fibroblasts,SCCVII and FsaR, respectively, and 21% for the B16F10. CREdid not show selective cytotoxicity between murine cancer andnormal cell lines, which may be a consequence of a cumulativeeffect of different bioactive compounds included in the crudeextract.For a more focused isolation process of the bioactiveconstituents of the crude extract, twelve fractions (A1-A12)obtained by separation of CRE via silica gel chromatographywere retested in the mentioned cell lines, revealing A6 and A8as fractions with the strongest cytotoxic activity. Both fractions(60 ug/mL) exhibited stronger cytotoxic activity on B16F10(< 10% cell survival) and SCCVII (<= 20% cell survival) cellFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97212fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 5Grienke et al.

Based on these results,fractions A6 and A8, were selected for further chromatographicseparations.Isolation and Identification of PureCompoundsSix constituents were isolated from CRE fractions A6 and A8 byseparation techniques including CC and preparative thin layerchromatography.By using HR-ESI-MS analyses and NMR experiments,and by comparison with earlier studies (Miyase et al.,1985; Zdero et al., 1989; Jang et al., 1999; Nagao et al.,2002; Marques et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013), the isolates(Figure 2) were identified as chrysin (1), oroxylin A (2),hispidulin (3), deacylcynaropicrin (4), (3aR,4S,6aR,8S,9aR,9bR)-[dodecahydro-8-dihydroxy-3,6,9-tris(methylene)-2oxo-2(3H)-azuleno[4,5-b]furanyl]-3-methyl-butanoate (5), andhemistepsin A (6). Instead of using the complicated and longsystematic name for compound 5, we created the trivialname ragusinin. The flavonoids (1-3) can be classifiedas flavones, whereby different substitution patterns withmethoxy or hydroxy groups can be observed on C-6 andC-4'. Compounds 4-6 are STLs belonging to the subtype ofguajanolides.FIGURE 2 | Chemical structures of isolated C. ragusina L. leaf constituents.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97213fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 6Grienke et al. Centaurea ragusina L. Isolates' BioactivityCompound 1 is a frequently occurring flavone reported as aconstituent of several Centaurea species (Mouffok et al., 2012).However, we are reporting here for the first time its isolationfrom C. ragusina L. Different bioactivities have been reportedfor compound 1. It suppresses inducible nitric oxide synthase,cyclooxygenase-2 expression and inhibits NF-kB activation,which altogether leads to anti-inflammatory effects (Feng et al.,2014). Compound 1 is also reported as a tumor cell growtharrest compound, arresting C6 glioma cells in the G1 phase ofthe cell cycle either through activating p38-MAPK leading tothe accumulation of p21Waf1/Cip1 protein or mediating theinhibition of proteasome activity (Weng et al., 2005). It alsosuppresses tumor growth of anaplastic thyroid cancer ATC cellsboth in vitro and in vivo (Yu et al., 2013).Compound 2 is known as the main component of severalmedicinal plants including Oroxylum indicum (Krueger andGanzera, 2012) and various Centaurea species. However, sofar it has not been reported for C. ragusina L. Compound 2was shown to activate caspase-3 and caspase-9 in human coloncarcinoma HCT-116 cells and decrease tumor volume and weightin immunodeficient mice that were inoculated with HCT-116cells (Hu et al., 2012). It also exhibits anti-inflammatory effectsby decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines mediated by estrogenreceptor activity (Wang et al., 2013).Compound 3 has been isolated from various Centaureaspecies, e.g., C. melitensis L. (Negrete et al., 1989), C. aspera L.(Ferreres et al., 1980), and C. jacea L. (Forgo et al., 2012), butnever from C. ragusina L. It is an important compound used intraditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of liver carcinoma(Gao et al., 2014). Besides an apoptotic effect on human livercancer HepG2 cells, it was also shown that this effect is mediatedvia mitochondrial dysfunction (Gao et al., 2014). Furthermore,an anti-proliferative effect toward human lung cancer A-549 cellswas reported for compound 3 (Zhang et al., 2012).Compound 4 has already been reported as a constituent ofC. ragusina L. (Mahmoud et al., 1986) and other Centaureaspecies with anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity (Gonzalezet al., 1977; Sosa et al., 2011).To the best of our knowledge, guajanolides 5 and 6 havenever been identified as constituents from Centaurea speciesbefore. Whereas for 6 an antibacterial and cytotoxic activitytoward human cell lines in the low uM range has previouslybeen reported (Jang et al., 1999) compound 5 (ragusinin) withits isovalerate residue is a rare STL without reports on bioactivity.Study of Biological Activity (InteractionsWith DNA, Antibacterial and CytotoxicActivity) of C. ragusina L. ConstituentsThe DNA binding affinity of compounds is important to exploresince the DNA represents a well-known target of several broadlyused drugs and the binding to DNA is one of the commoncauses of cell death (Demeunynck et al., 2002; Sangeetha Gowdaet al., 2014). In order to determine the binding affinity of theisolated compounds to ctDNA, UV/Vis spectroscopy and ITC(Bronowska, 2011) were employed (see section "Experimental"and "Supplementary Material for details"). CD was used formonitoring of conformational changes of ctDNA induced bysmall molecule binding and for gaining information about modesof interaction (Cantor and Schimmel, 1980; Johnson, 1994).Among isolated STLs and flavonoids (SupplementaryMaterial), only 5 exhibited significant changes in CD titrations(Supplementary Figure S4). Due to that reason, we decided tocharacterize the binding of DNA only with compound 5. UV/Visspectroscopy was not applicable in the study of DNA-ragusinininteraction due to absorption of STLs at short wavelengths(210-220 nm). Therefore, the binding interaction of 5 withctDNA was monitored by ITC.The ITC experiment of 5 with ctDNA resulted in negativepeaks indicating that the binding process was exothermic(Figure 3). The resulting values were fitted to a single-site bindingmodel by the non-linear least square method yielding rathermoderate binding constant (log Ka = 4.04). The stoichiometry(N) was fixed to 0.5 based on results from CD titration withctDNA (the saturation of binding sites was reached at theratio, r = 0.5, Supplementary Material). The binding of 5 toctDNA was characterized by a positive binding entropy (T1rS/kJmol-1 = 18.5) accompanied by smaller negative enthalpy(1rH/kJ mol-1 = -4.6) revealing that its binding is entropicallydriven. In many cases, the groove binding is associated withpositive (favorable) binding entropies due to the release ofFIGURE 3 | Calorimetric titration of compound 5 (c = 3 x 10-5 mol dm-3)with ctDNA (c = 1.5 x 10-3 mol dm-3) in sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0,I = 0.05 mol dm-3; T = 25*C; 1rG/kJ mol-1 = -23.0). The top panelsrepresent the raw data from the single injection of ctDNA into a solution of 5and the bottom panels show the experimental injection heats while the solidlines represent the calculated fit of the data.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 97214fphar-09-00972 August 21, 2018 Time: 8:18 # 7Grienke et al.
