The concentration range for testing of the lineari-ty of the method was: 50.00-150.00 ug/mL for cilazapril, 125.00-375.00 ug/mL for hydrochlorothiazide, 0.50-1.50 ug/mL for cilazaprilat and 0.25-3.75 ug/mL for hydrochlo-rothiazide impurity B. The calculated calibration equa-tions were y=29.7081x+18.9990, y=83.4604x+2180.4154, y=7.0676x-2.2344 and y=6.3525x+0.1990 for cilazapril, hydrochlorothiazide, cilazaprilat and hydrochlorothiazide impurity B, respectively. The correlation coefficients were 0.9999, 0.9998, 0.9977 and 0.9959 for cilazapril, hydro-chlorothiazide, cilazaprilat, hydrochlorothiazide impurity B, respectively and they indicated that the relationship be-tween peak area and the concentration was linear over in-vestigated concentration range. Experimentally determined value of limit of quantifi-cation for cilazaprilat and hydrochlorothiazide impurity B were 0.5 ug/mL and 0.25 ug/mL, respectively. The precision of the method was considered as intra-assay and it was performed in six repetitive measurements where concentration levels were: 100 ug/mL for cilaza-pril, 250 ug/mL for hydrochlorothiazide, 1.0 ug/mL for cilazaprilat and 2.5 ug/mL for hydrochlorothiazide impu-rity B. Results were expressed as relative standard devia-tion values which were 0.35%, 0.25%, 4.61% and 3.23% for cilazapril, hydrochlorothiazide, cilazaprilat and hydro-chlorothiazide impurity B, respectively.ConclusionStability profile of cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide was established and stability-indicating method was devel-oped. The method showed good robustness and met all val-idation criteria.ReferencesAlsante, K.M., Ando, A., Brown, R., Ensing, J., Hatajik, T.D., Kong, W., Tsuda, Y., 2007.

It is monohydrochloride salt of 1-cyclopropyl-7-[(S,S)-2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl]-6-fluoro-8-methoxy-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3 quino-line carboxylic acid (RxList, 2016). The analytical meth-ods for its determination in pharmaceutical dosage forms are not so numerous and can be categorized generally into two groups: nonseparative UV-Vis spectroscopic methods, zero order (Dhumal et al., 2011; Sahu et al., 2011) or de-rivative (Dhumal et al., 2011) and separative, dominantly chromatographic methods (Abdelaziz et al., 2012; Dewani et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2014). These cited HPLC meth-ods for quantification of moxifloxacin, found during liter-ature search, show some unwanted features like skewed or asymmetric peaks and excessive retention achieved with 250 mm long columns. Above presented facts prompted us to develop HPLC method for fast, simple, accurate, reproducible and rugged quantification of moxifloxacin in solid pharmaceutical dos-age forms.Materials and methodsThe chemicals were Ph.Eur. grade. Potassium dihydro-gen phosphate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, dipro-pylamine and 85% phosphoric acid were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich, USA, whereas methanol was purchased from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. The demineral-ized water was Stilman produced and had conductivity less than 1 uS. Moxifloxacin working standard and Moxiflox-acin film-coated tablets 400 mg were purchased from Re-plek Farm, Skopje, Macedonia. The experiments were performed on three HPLC sys-tems: Varian Prostar with DAD 330 detector controlled with Varian Star software version 6.21, UPLC Dionex with four-channel UV-Vis detector controlled with Chromeleon ver-sion 6.8 and UPLC Shimadzu Nexera with dual-channel UV-Vis detector controlled with Lab Solutions version 5.54.Following HPLC columns were tested: - RP Select B 125 mm x 4 mm, 5 um (Merck Darm-stadt, Germany);- Discovery C8 150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 um (Supelco Bellefonte, USA);- Discovery C18 100 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 um (Supelco Bellefonte, USA);- Discovery C18 125 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 um (Supelco Bellefonte, USA).The test and standard solutions were prepared by dis-solving suitable amount of the active substance or pow-dered film-coated tablets in methanol or water to obtain concentrations in the range of 0.1 - 0.5 mg/mL.Results and discussionThe characteristic UV-absorption spectrum of moxi-floxacin with maximum at 293 nm permits use of almost all commonly used buffers in chromatography. Consider-ing moxifloxacin pKa values (pKa1=6.25 and pKa2=9.29) (Lanqlois et al., 2005) and its well documented solubility in more polar solvents, phosphate buffers with pH value 3 S2 PP 88194Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 193 - 194 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsin combination with methanol as mobile phase were used. Two different phosphate buffers, 25-30 mM NH4H-2PO4 and KH2PO4 with pH=3 were tested. Slight insignifi-cant advantage was given to ammonium dihydrogen phos-phate compared to potassium dihydrogen phosphate, when peak symmetries were compared. The mobile phases were tested without and with added dipropylamine as a peak symmetry corrector by suppressing the ion-exchange inter-action of residual silanol groups with protonated N-atoms in analyte molecule. The addition of 0.2% v/v dipropyl-amine in 25 mM ammonium dihydrogen phosphate at pH 3 improved the peak symmetry from 1.47 to 1.25. Fluoroquinolones with their characteristic molecule structure are well known to chromatographists as prob-lematic with yielding tailing peaks on the chromatograms, usually corrected with use of high percentage of amines in mobile phase composition, up to 1 - 2% v/v. This prompt-ed our investigation, to choose chromatographic column which has high quality end-capped silica particles with lowest content of residual metal cations.Toward aiming the goal, two C8-octylsilane columns and two C18-octadecylsilane columns from the same man-ufacturer but with different dimensions were tested. The comparison of the chromatograms obtained with C8 and C18 columns from identical vendors showed that no significant preferences could be noticed. Both C8 and C18 can create perfect peak of moxifloxacin which can be fine adjusted with retention needed. It was clearly seen that lowering the percentage of methanol from 55% v/v to 40% v/v increases the peak retention and symmetry. Slight pref-erence from the peak symmetry and less organic consump-tion point of view in our experiments showed C8 filled col-umns, that yielded moxifloxacin peak with t5% = 1.15. This fact generally does not prefer C8 over C18 columns, since peak symmetry could be sacrificed in aim to improve resolution, which is more important in chromatographic separations. Depending on the sample constituents com-plexity and target system suitability demands of the chro-matographic method, C8 and C18 could be successfully in-terchanged and optimized for all demands. C8 reversed phase column has stronger hydrophobic interactions than Phenyl-RP columns but weaker than C18. The HPLC method for related compounds of moxifloxacin, described in Ph.Eur.8 (2014) uses Phenyl-bonded RP col-umn with TBAH cationic ion pair reagent in mobile phase, and it shows relatively close elution of related compounds with moxifloxicin. This is expected to be improved with use of more retentive C18 column.The use of chromatographic columns having particles with wide pores also showed to be advantage in our in-vestigations. Discovery C8 columns have pores with about 180 nm diameter, whereas RP Select B columns have 60 nm pores diameter, and generate wide skewed and distort-ed peak of moxifloxacin. Discovery columns are better end-capped and more base-deactivated, which was shown to be advantage dur-ing our method development. Finally, the proposed chromatographic conditions for the optimized method for quantification of moxifloxacin are: mobile phase composed of 25 mM NH4H2PO4 pH=3 and methanol (65% : 35%, v/v), with flow rate 1.1 ml/min, HPLC column Discovery C8 150 mm x 4.6 mm with 5 um particles, thermostated at 35 degC, detection wavelength at 293 nm and injection volume of 5 ul. Moxifloxacin peak elutes for less than 5 minutes with symmetry expressed as AsUSP ~1.2.ConclusionThe proposed method is fast, simple cost-effective, re-producible and rugged, intended for high-throughput rou-tine assay analysis of moxifloxacin in solid pharmaceutical dosage forms. It can be further optimized and improved, using columns with different properties, better retention and selectivity, or changed ratio of mobile phase constit-uent, in order to achieve better retention of moxifloxacin peak and better resolution from its degradation products in order to make it suitable for use during stability testing of the pharmaceutical formulations.

Its IUPAC name is 1-eth-yl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-(1-piperazinyl)-3-quino-linecarboxylic acid (RxList, 2016). Majority of fluoroqui-nolone molecules, especially norfloxacin, are well known as problematic in terms of peak shape appearing on the chromatograms. They are often obtained as highly asym-metric, tailing peaks with calculated values of symmetry factor of about 2 or even greater. This fact complicates and compromises method accuracy based on the difficulties in determination of peak end on baseline. These problems are frequently solved with use of expensive high quality HPLC columns with double and triple end-capped bond-ed reversed phase silica matrixes and extensive base-deac-tivation of metal cations from silica particles. British Phar-macopoeial monograph (BP, 2013) for norfloxacin active pharmaceutical ingredient assay determination prescribes use of C16 column with gradient elution with water acidi-fied to pH ~2 and acetonitrile at high column temperature of 60 degC and for norfloxacin tablets acidic isocratic elu-tion with 0.1% v/v o-H3PO4 and acetonitrile with previous washing of column with different buffer, for 8 hours.Many different methods are published (Bera et al., 2014; Chierentin and Salgado, 2013; Oliveira et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2013) for norfloxacin determination in phar-maceutical dosage form.
