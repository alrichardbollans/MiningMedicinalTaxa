A research conducted in Belgium about the role of phar-macists in the care of patients with depression showed that pharmacists are not sufficiently involved in the treatment of patients with depression as well as the insufficient edu-cation of the pharmacists regarding mental disorders (Liek-ens et al., 2012). Pharmacists are the most devoted health professionals - patients visit pharmacists seven times more than they visit doctors. These data show us that pharma-cists through pharmaceutical care can make the fastest and the cheapest contribution to a good outcome of this multi-disciplinary approach in the treatment of patients with de-pression.ConclusionThe high prevalence of depression and anxiety disor-ders and the trend of growth of the affected demand a de-tailed analysis of causes, treatment, cormobidity and in-teractions, as well as keeping track of the consumption of medications for the rehabilitation of symptoms caused by these disorders which in the future could facilitate im-provement of adherence, the effect of therapy and im-provement in quality of life.ReferencesBinakaj, Z., 2015.

Within neo-plasms, breast cancer is the second most frequent cancer after lung cancer (INSTAT, 2016). Breast cancer treatment generally involves multiple approaches including surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Adjuvant treatment is the administration of additional therapy after primary surgery to kill or inhibit micrometastasis (Tarifa et al., 2007). De-pending on the model of risk reduction, adjuvant therapy has been estimated to be responsible for 35-72% reduction in mortality rate (Newton and Grethlein, 2015).The adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer has changed several times since the first effective chemother-apy regimen for breast cancer CMF, (cyclophosphamide; methotrexate; 5-fluorouracil) was developed (Bonadonna et al., 1976).To date, there is no 'gold standard' regimen in adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer. The diversity of the disease depending on biomarkers, the proliferation process and di-versity of trials, with different interpretations, has led to endless suppositions and discussion on the best treatment. However, there is general agreement that CMF-like regi-mens are 'better than nothing', that anthracycline-contain-ing regimens are better than CMF, and that the taxanes fur-ther add to the benefit of anthracyclines (Peto, 2007).The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of ad-juvant chemotherapy, taxane-based regiment with anthra-cycline- based regiment in woman with breast cancer in Albania.Materials and methodsA case-series study was conducted at the University Hospital Center "Mother Teresa" in Tirana including 181 women diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with ad-juvant chemotherapy. Women included in this study had an age range 18-70 years, with stage I-III of breast cancer irrespective of nodal, hormonal, or HER2 status. Respec-tively, 35 women were treated with taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen and 146 women were treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen after primary surgery. The clinical diagnosis was based on biop-sy findings. A 5-year follow-up of took place where the re-lapse experience was recorded for all women included in this study. Results and discussionTaxane-based regimen has become the most popular adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in the last decade (Jones et al., 2009). Overall, in our study there were 35 women treated with taxane-based regimen. In the group of wom-en treated with taxane-based (paclitaxel or docetaxel) regi-men as adjuvant chemotherapy, 8 (22.9%) of them experi-enced relapse within four years compared with 27 (77.1%) women who did not manifest relapse after the fourth year of follow-up. The distribution of relapse time among wom-en treated with 4AC-4T(paclitaxel or docetaxel) was as follows: there were 2 women (5.7%) who experienced a relapse within the first 12 months; 2 (5.7%) within 24 months; 1 (2.9%) within 36 months; and 3 (8.6%) women within 48 months. Conversely, 27 (77.1%) did not manifest relapses after the fourth year of follow-up. Overall, in our study there were 142 women treated S1 PP 44104Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 103 - 104 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationswith anthracycline-based regimen. In the group of women treated with anthracycline-based regimen (CAF (N=142, or 97.3%) or AC-CMF (N=4, or 2.7%) of adjuvant chemotherapy, overall 34 (24.5%) of them experienced relapse within four years compared with 105 (75.5%) women who did not manifest relapses after the fourth year of follow-up. On the whole, 6 (4.3%) women experienced a relapse within the first 12 months; 13 (9.4%) within 24 months; 6 (4.3%) within 36 months; and 9 (6.5%) women within 48 months. On the other hand, 105 (75.5%) did not manifest relapses after the fourth year of follow-up. After 5 years of follow-up, there was an improvement in relapse-free survival between taxane-based regiment and anthracycline based regiment (77.1% vs 75.5%). Ben-efits were observed irrespectively of nodal, hormonal or HER2 status.The 2011 EBCTCG meta-analysis also included tax-anes such as docetaxel and paclitaxel in its analysis of ad-juvant therapy. Incorporation of taxanes into an anthracy-cline containing regimen resulted at 8 years in the reduc-tion of the risk of recurrence, risk of breast cancer mortali-ty, and overall mortality. This benefit was present irrespec-tive of age, nodal status, tumor size, tumor grade or estro-gen receptor (ER) status (Peto et al., 2012). Our study obtained similar results, regardless of the small size sample. Hence, incorporation of taxanes such as docetaxel or paclitaxel into adjuvant chemotherapy reg-imens led to a reduction in disease recurrence. This benefit was evident independent of age, nodal status, tumor size, tumor grade, estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 status. ConclusionAfter 5 years of follow-up, there was an improvement in relapse-free survival between taxane-based regimen and anthracycline-based regimen respectively 77.1% and 75.5% in Albanian women diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Benefits were observed irrespectively of nodal, hormonal, or HER2 status. These findings have important implications for practitioners and policy-makers in Albania and beyond.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* alka@ff.ukim.edu.mkIntroductionColorectal cancer (CRC), with an estimated 447,000 new cases and an estimated 215,000 deaths occurring in 2012, is the second most common cancer and also the sec-ond most common cause of cancer death in Europe (Gra-ham et al., 2014). The incidence of CRC is strongly re-lated to age (83% of cases occurring in patients who are aged 60 years or older). The ageing population and glob-al effect of "westernization" are additional factors driving a rapid increase in new CRC cases worldwide. As a conse-quence, the already significant societal burden of CRC is likely to increase over time. Important economic compo-nents of this burden include direct medical care costs, di-rect nonmedical costs (such as patient time involved with receiving medical care), and productivity losses among pa-tients and caregivers (Yabroff et al., 2013). The most important CRC prognostic factor is the disease stage at the time of diagnosis (from a 90% of 5-year survival rate for cancers detected at the localized stage; 70% for regional; to 10% for people diagnosed for distant metastatic cancer). Approximately 25% of newly diagnosed patients have already developed metastases; al-most 50% of all CRC patients will form metastases over time as the disease progresses. Metastatic colorectal can-cer (mCRC) is characterised by a high mortality rate. In the last decade, fluoropirimidine drugs (5-fluoro-uracil-FU and leucovorin -LV) combined with oxaliplat-in or irinotecan chemotherapy regimens (FOLFOX and FOLFIRI), were best available mCRC treatment. In re-cent years, the significantly increased mCRC survival rates have resulted mainly from the introduction of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as additional first-line treatment to che-motherapy or in subsequent treatment lines (Lange et al., 2014). According to the European Society for Medical Oncol-ogy (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines for mCRC, beva-cizumab (mAb against the vascular endothelial growth fac-tor -VEGF) and panitumumab and cetuximab (which bind the epidermal growth factor receptor - EGFR) in combina-tion with chemotherapy can be considered as first line op-tions for selected patients with mCRC. The ESMO recom-mendations are based on the improved outcomes report-ed for these biologics versus chemotherapy alone in clini-cal trials (Van Cutsem et al., 2010). Despite the established therapeutic efficacy and safety, this new mAbs based che-motherapy regimens have dramatically increased the cost of treatment. Pharmacoeconomic assessments are a part of the deci-sion process not only during reimbursement setting, but in clinical practice as well. Estimates of the costs associated with cancer care are essential both for assessing burden of disease at the population level and for conducting econom-ic evaluations of interventions to prevent, detect, or treat cancer. Comparisons of cancer costs between health sys-tems and across countries can improve understanding of the economic consequences of different health-care poli-cies and programs.The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effec-tiveness/ utility of bevacizumab plus FOLFOX vs. FOLF-OX alone in 1st line treatment of patients with mCRC from the payer perspective in R. MacedoniaS1 PP 45106Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 105 - 106 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsMaterials and methodsA Decision tree structure approach was selected to as-sess the cost-effectiveness of Bevacizumab plus FOLFOX relative to FOLFOX in the first line treatment of patients with mCRC. The model uses a 2-week cycle length and a time horizon of 2 years post treatment initiation. The en-tire patient population was composed of a simulated co-hort of 100 mCRC patients/treatment branch. The patients progressed through the decision tree based on the risk of early therapy discontinuations because of severe toxicity (ST), disease progression (DP) and cancer associated death (CAD) during active treatment. After completion of the first 2 cycles of chemotherapy, patients without experienced ST from first-line therapy (FOLFOX +- bavacizumab) are con-tinuing the treatment until DP. For patients with intolera-ble toxicity, first-line therapy is discontinued and second-line FOLFIRI is offered until DP. Upon progression, all pa-tients receive best supportive care until death. The transi-tion probabilities between the health states for bevacizumab plus FOLXOX and FOLFOX alone treatment were based on parametric survival curves estimated in a patient-level anal-ysis of progression free survival (PFS) and overall surviv-al (OS) from the NO16966 clinical trial (Saltz et al., 2008). Only direct costs (bevacizumab and FOLFOX che-motherapy), were included in the analysis. Drug-acquisition costs were calculated utilizing official government and hos-pital pharmacy publicly available data. All costs are report-ed in 2016 Euros. The benefit and performance of medical treatments, measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were extracted from the published data (Ramsey et al., 2000, 2002). The incremental cost per QALY gained was calcu-lated as the difference in total costs divided by difference in QALY. All costs and outcomes (benefits) in the model were discounted using discount rate of 3.5% per annum. A sensitivity analyses on the estimates of costs, utili-ties, and health state transitions were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model and address uncertainty of vari-ables. In univariable sensitivity analyses, we varied the val-ue of costs and utilities within +- 20% of their baseline values and examined the effect on the ICER. In probabilistic sen-sitivity analyses (PSAs), we ran the model 1000 times, each time randomly varying all parameters simultaneously. We used uniform distribution for cost parameters and gaussian distribution for the efficacy parametars and discount factor. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of both the Macedonian public and private health care systems.Results and discussionBase case analyses The initial drug costs for bevacizumab +FOLFOX compared to FOLFOX were estimated at EUR2312.86 and EUR451.22, respectively, per 2-week cycle. In the primary analysis, the effectiveness and costs were compared in the first-line model for the FOLFOX and FOLFOX-plus-bevacizumab groups. FOLFOX provided 1.31 QALYs at a cost of EUR1963.86. FOLFOX plus bevacizumab provided 1.41 QALYs at a cost of EUR11021.899.
