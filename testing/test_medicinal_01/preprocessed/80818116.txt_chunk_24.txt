Total number of patients was 348 in evaluated period January - April 2013. The Evaluation of the therapy used in the study was according to the guidelines for evidence-based medicine issued by the Ministry of Health of RM for the treatment of diseases that are diagnosed in the test popula-tion. For the diagnoses for which there is not recommend-ed guidelines, the European and American Associations for the treatment of given diseases guidelines were used. In order to detect discrepancies in the rational drug use for each of the evaluated drugs, DDD expressed per 100 hos-pital beds was calculated. The obtained data were statisti-cally analyzed using SPSS.v.20 software licensed program.Results and discussionIn Clinical hospital - Stip, annually expenditure for drugs is 500 000.00 euros and 7.1% belongs to the orthope-dic department. From 348 hospitalized patients on this de-partment in evaluated period, 218 patients (62.64%) were treated conservatively and 130 patients (37.36%) with sur-gery intervention. The average age of evaluated patients was 57.14 +- 20.3 years and average time of hospitaliza-tion per patient was 7.74 +- 10.4 days. In most of the hos-pitalized patients diagnose was bone fracture and almost all patients received more than 4 drugs as parenteral thera-py. The most commonly used analgesic for the pain control treatment was Amp. Ketoprofen. According to the obtained data in February, 51 out of 75 patients (68%) received Ke-toprofen of which 19 (38.59%) more than 5 days. In Feb-ruary 56.99 DDD/HHB Ketoprofen was used with extra costs of 27.35%. In March 66 patients (61%) received Ke-toprofen of which 17 (25.76%) more than 5 days. In April 41 patients (43.16%) received Ketoprofen of which 16 (39.02%) received more than 5 days. The DDD/HHB for S1 PP 50116Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 115 - 116 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsKetoprofen in April was 18.82. Ketoprofen was applied in almost all patients who were hospitalized at the orthopedic department at the Clinical Hospital Stip, much longer than recommendations of 5 days and parenteral form of the this drug was not replaced with an oral form.The same situation is evident for the application of Tramadol. From total 160 inpatients for four months peri-od who received Tramadol, 65 of them received more than 4 days. In January, 41 patients (58.57%) received Trama-dol of which 22 (53.66%) received Tramadol more than 4 days. The DDD/HHB in January was 11.35. In Febru-ary, 32 (42.67%) received Tramadol, 8 of which (25%) received more than 4 days. Relatively same situation we evaluated in March and April. Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is indi-cated in patients who performed more surgical interven-tion. Evidence-based medicine shows that the prevalence of asymptomatic DVT detected by routine venography af-ter larger orthopedic intervention is lower in hospitals that implement prophylaxis 10 days compared to hospitals that carry out prophylaxis only 5 days. This observation sup-ports the current recommendations of the American Col-lege of Chest Physicians (ACCP) for a minimum 7-10 days prophylaxis in patients who undergo surgery at or-thopedics. In January, total of 16 (22.86%) hospitalized pa-tients received thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and only 5 (31.25%) patients re-ceived prophylaxis in accordance with the recommenda-tions (>=7days). The associated DDD/HHB value for this month was 20.07. In February, 3 patients (4%) received LMWH and only 1 (33.33%) received more than 7 days and the DDD/HHB was 1.52. In March 5 patients (4.63%) received LMWH with highest extra cost of 68.46 %. In April, 14 patients (14.74%) patients received LMWH 5 of which (35.71%) received more than 7 days. Low-Dose Un-fractionated Heparin (LDUH) is used at the department in accordance with recommendations for thromboprophylax-is prevention and treatment of thrombosis for several de-cades. In January, 22 patients (31.43%) received thrombo-prophylaxis with LDUH of which 15 (68.18%) patients re-ceived prophylaxis as it was recommended (>=7days). In January utilization was 35.48 DDD/HHB with extra cost of 33.26%. In February, 32 patients (42.67%) received LDUH of which 15 (46.87%) received more than 7 days. In March, from 108 patients, 39 (36.11%) received LDUH of which 17 (43.59%) more than 7 days and the DDD/HHB value was 39.99. In April 34 (35.79%) received LDUH of which 23 (67.65%) received more than 7 days and DDD/HHB value was 34.95.Regarding to the use of antibiotics for prophylaxis in orthopedic patients we found that ceftriaxone was mostly used antibiotic values for DDD/HHB from 26.24 to 42.74 and in all evaluated period the period of using of this anti-biotic was more than 2 days.

The complexity of the manufacturing process of those drugs, the character of the active substance and the nature of their activity, demands a stringent regulatory framework for these medicines. Biosimilar medicines, according to the World Health Organization (which refers to them as "similar biotherapeutic products"), are products which are manufactured following the expiration of the patents or the data protection for the first major group of the originator's biological products. There is a strong interest by health-care stakeholders in measuring the biosimilar utilization and impact on the market entry. Regulatory issues, manu-facturing, safety, pricing, and physician and patient accep-tance have a big influence in the developing the biosimi-lar market. With regulatory approval pathways encourag-ing more competition among manufacturers of biologics, there follows the prospect of increased litigation and other threats to intellectual property rights. Biosimilar patent lit-igation continues to evolve as biosimilars enter new glob-al markets. The European Union (EU) was the one of the first highly regulated areas to develop a legal and regulato-ry framework for the approval for highly similar versions of innovator biological products. Although formal approv-al pathway for biosimilar began in the EU very early in 2001 (European Medicines Agency, 2003), the European Commission (EC) first amended its market authorization forsimilar biological medicinal products in 2003 (Com-mission Directive 2003/63/EC, 2003), and issued its first general biosimilar guidance in 2005 (European Medicines Agency, 2005). The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) first approval under the new similar biological medicinal product pathway was in 2006 (Sandoz's somatropin called Omnitrope(r)) and since then 20 biosimilars are approved in EMA (European Medicines Agency list of approved bi-osimilars, 2016).While the EU's legal system is complicat-ed by the lack of a unified patent litigation system that re-quires a multicountry patent litigation approach, the US's biosimilar patent litigation has been complicated by bio-similar applicants and the reference biological product ap-plicants picking and choosing what portion of the default patent litigation exchange system to utilize. Despite the differences between the litigation strategies in the EU and the US, as biosimilar approvals become worldwide more globalized, and it will be increasingly important to appre-ciate these differences and consideration to how biosimi-lars patent litigation arguments and outcomes in one situa-tion can benefit and be utilized in other situation, even if in different countries or legal systems. Still there are some limitation on the patent issue of bi-osimilars like that the subject matter is not patentable, the invention was not explained clearly or completely enough or the subject matter extends beyond the content of the ap-plication filed. From the other side, there are also different possible outcomes such as rejection of patent, the patent is maintained in amended form with a new published specifi-cation, or the patent is revoked. Initial opposition decisions may be appealed within two months, and countries may have conflicting rules whether they stay or halt further le-gal process, national patent infringement actions while an opposition and any associated appeal is pending. The me-dian time for an appeal is close to three years, which is the same approximate median time for an opposition for pat-S1 PP 51118Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 117 - 118 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsents concerning pharmaceutical and biotechnology prod-ucts (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010).Concurrently or following an opposition, biosimilars pat-ent litigation may begin in member countries but still liti-gation in each county requires detailed knowledge of that country's national patent litigation procedures. Due to the differences in patent litigation rules and bi-osimilars regulatory applications, there may be advantag-es to bring an initial biosimilars patent litigation in the one primary biosimilar markets, the place of business or man-ufacture of the biosimilar, or based on a received jurisdic-tional favoring the action. Because each country has its own law system where patent holders may enforce their patents, there is the possibility for conflicting patent en-forcement decisions in different countries, where biosimi-lar manufacturers may pursue national patent litigations in member countries simultaneously or successively. There-fore there appears to be limited patent litigation challeng-es in the EU with a preference to patent issuance challeng-es and some limited country patent challenges. There are many unresolved issues that will affect European patent challenges, especially for bridging biosimilar products on the EU market.ReferencesCommission Directive 2003/63/EC, 2003.

NSAIDs have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, an-tipyretic or antireumatic action and differ in activity and severity of adverse effects. These drugs have more or less serious side effects affecting the most gastrointestinal tract. NSAIDs should not be prescribed to patients with gastric or duodenal ulcer, because their use may lead to bleeding and even to a lethal outcome. All NSAIDs can be structurally divided into several groups: derivatives of salicylic acid, p-aminophenol deriv-atives, propionic acid derivatives, indole derivatives, phen-ylacetic acid derivatives, oxicams, and fenamates naftilac-etatne acid derivatives. NSAIDs are indicated in different treatments because of their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic and antirheumatic effects. The NSAID anti-in-flammatory action is due to inhibitory activity on prosta-glandin G/H synthase (cyclooxygenase). This enzyme cat-alyzes the transformation of arachidonic acid to prosta-glandins and thromboxanes. There are two forms of this enzyme: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 enzyme is normal-ly present in the body, whiles the inducible COX-2 enzyme (cytokines, fibroblasts, epithelial cells) occurs only in in-flammatory conditions. Both enzymes have very similar structure (COX-1 consists of 599 amino acids, a COX-2 of 604) (Varagic and Milosevic, 1991).The analgesic effect NSAIDs is achieved by reduc-ing peripheral sensitization of polymodal nocireptor, while antipyretic effect is achieved by inhibition of prostaglan-din E2. This prostaglandin is responsible for the activation of a special section in the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature in the formation of an inflammatory con-dition. General side effects of NSAIDs are associated di-rectly or indirectly with the irritation of the digestive sys-tem. NSAIDs have a twofold effect on the digestive sys-tem: acid molecules directly irritate the lining of the stom-ach, and the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 reduces the levels of protective prostaglandins.Common side effects on the digestive system include, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, stomach ulcer/bleeding in the stomach, diarrhea. Higher doses treatment is associated with increased risk of ulceration. In efforts to reduce the adverse effects on the digestive system, it is recommend-ed to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period, which is not the case in practice (Walker and Ed-wards, 1998).Materials and methodsIn this study, data were collected at the pharmacy, where we monitored quantity of prescription for NSAIDs, and the utilization of these drugs issued at the request of the patient (without a prescription). Evaluation lasted one month and twenty days, in which we monitored the amount of received recipes and amount of patients who take this medication without consulting doctor or pharmacist. Also we asked doctor how many patients come and ask for a prescription for NSAIDs and how they used them.Results and discussionOn average 200 patients come in the pharmacy and 130 out of them were looking for drugs that are used as S1 PP 52120Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 119 - 120 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationPoster presentationsanalgesics or antipyretics, whereas approximately 90 pa-tients used some NSAIDs. Only 15 out of 90 patients have a prescription for the drug. Patients were not familiar with the problems that are linked to use of this type of medica-tion. According to results obtained from doctors approx-imately 85% of patients who use NSAIDs do not have a doctor's prescription. Patients used these drugs mainly for treatment of pain, and they chose them because are easi-ly available. ConclusionNSAID medicines are of great importance and one of the most commonly used medicines in hospitals and out-patient conditions. They are relatively safe drugs but their complications sometimes can be severe and fatal. Patients with current ulcer disease are more eligible for treatment with proton pump inhibitors in therapeutic dose, while pa-tients without current ulcer with a history of previous ill-ness of bleeding for treatment with dose of maintenance. The use of selective COX-2 inhibitors is justified for pa-tients at risk for gastrointestinal complications with previ-ous consultation with doctor or pharmacist.ReferencesVaragic, V.V, Milosevic, M.P., 1991.
