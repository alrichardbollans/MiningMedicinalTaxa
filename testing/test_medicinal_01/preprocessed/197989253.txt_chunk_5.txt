This, together with insuffi cient physical exercise, is causing a profusion of diet-related illnesses, which in turn cause much human suffering and signifi cant expenditure. Europe and China face similar problems in this respect. Because these problems are continually discussed in the media, consumers are increasingly aware of the diet-health relationship.1 In the past, dietary advice has often focused on what not to eat. Currently, the focus is on what should be eaten more. There is an abundance of foods on the market that are consumed in order to improve one's health in general or in a particular manner. 'Functional foods' is the term used for foods with special health effects.2 Interest in functional foods is stimulated by several factors. There is a market push from food companies looking for products with higher margins. A plethora of private research resources are invested in functional foods. Clinical studies are being performed world-wide to show effects of new foods or food ingredients. Functional attributes of many traditional foods are being discovered, and new products are being developed with benefi cial components3. Market pull is created by aging, affl uent populations of health conscious consumers.4In addition to companies and consumers, functional foods are interesting also from a governments' perspective. The main severe health challenges in Western countries are obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Healthcare costs are increasing, and the prevalence of all of these diseases can be affected by dietary choices. Heart conditions and diabetes, along with the acceptance of Western-like diets have also become more common in Asia. This means the diet-related health problems are largely the same all over the world and different governments are faced with the almost identical task of promoting the same kind of dietary change. Public research funds are liberally invested in functional foods to support private research efforts.1 This awareness as such is nothing new. For example Hippocrates said in 337 BC "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food". This wisdom is now being rediscovered in the West.2 There are different defi nitions of the term 'functional food', and related terms referring to similar products. In chapter 1.3., we present the different defi nitions and defi ne the term 'functional food' for our purposes.3 International Food Information Council. Functional Foods. Backgrounder. November 2007. 4 Katan 1999, 1.-2-1.2 Law on Functional FoodsLegislation on functional foods has not developed as quickly as functional foods. It is typical that legal development follows scientifi c development. Compared to discussing the legal defi nitions, scientists are more interested in developing effective products, and marketers more interested in fi nding attractive marketing messages. Consumers need time to become acquainted with new types of products. 5 It has been acknowledged that legal defi nitions and rules on product safety and effi cacy are needed for consumers to trust the products and the markets to develop. New legislation has been shown to be necessary. The wrong type of legislation, confusing legislation or non-existing legislation might discourage fi rms from investing in safety assessment and research.6 This could lead to a situation where: the food industry lacks innovative and successful products to compete with, - consumers do not get the product selection they are willing to pay for, and- populations are not as healthy as they could be.- 7Currently no legal defi nitions exist for functional foods. Health claim legislation can be seen as indirectly defi ning functional foods, though. According to Heasman and Mellentin, the exceptional speed of internationally agreeing on the need of health claim legislation shows the power of the functional food concept8. For example, United States, Japanese, and Chinese legislation developed quite quickly after the functional food business started to grow. Health claim standards were developed by Codex Alimentarius already in the beginning of the 21st century. Similarly, some European states like Sweden, the Netherlands, and the UK, regulated functional foods and health claims early on. States in southern Europe, conversely, were in no rush to regulate. The European disagreement on the need, purpose, and content of common legislation led to lengthy negotiations, before nutrition and health claim legislation fi nally came into effect in 2007.The basic legal question with functional foods is the division between foodstuffs and medicinal products. In Europe, foods and medicines were traditionally separate legal categories. Food safety fundamentally signifi ed hygiene rules and safety evaluations concerning the use of chemicals. It was not a problem that marketing claims relating to diseases were prohibited on foodstuffs. In the Eastern countries infl uenced by Chinese culture, food and medicines have traditionally been thought of as materials from the same source, not something separate. For example, a plant can be used as food for healthy people and as medicine for people who are sick. It is thus not a Western invention 5 See also Kwak - Jukes 2000a, 101.6 Salminen - Mykkanen 2002, 33. See also Kotler 2002, 174-175. The legal issues are something a food marketer wants to consider already at the product development phase. It is not clever to develop a product with a focus on a certain planned marketing strategy only to fi nd out that such a product is not even allowed, or that the planned marketing claim is prohibited.7 According to Brookes, this is exactly what has happened with regard to novel foods and their regulation in Europe. R&D expenditure on food products tends to be lower in the EU compared to average levels in other countries. As a result, improved products are not available to EU consumers. Levels of income and employment generation in the EU are, according to Brookes, "probably" lower than in more "innovation-friendly" regulatory environments. Brookes 2007, 6.8 Heasman - Mellentin 2001, 104.-3-and not simply a current phenomenon that the categories of food and drugs can sometimes overlap; merely functional foods make this overlap more obvious.Regulating safety and effi cacy of consumer products is basic consumer protection law. Consumer protection law can be divided into product safety, contract terms, marketing, and product liability9. Here we deal with two of these areas: product safety and marketing. Product safety is defi ned as physical safety, protecting the consumer's body. Safety is a relative term referring to absence of negative health effects. Effi cacy is used as a term related to marketing claims of the product. Effi cacy means that the product delivers the health-benefi t it promises. The basic goal of marketing regulation is economic safety - protecting the consumer's purse10. This means marketing rules may also be seen as part of product safety.The regulation of medicines and the regulation of foods have important features in common. Both groups of products are used in a way that leads to a potential risk to consumers11. Costs of inadequate information are severe, and yet the markets do not accord information its full value12. Consumers usually cannot see the ingredients, qualities, or functions of a foodstuff or a medicine just by looking at the product. Even if all the scientifi c information was available to consumers, they still could not determine the potential risks or benefi ts for their health. This signifi cant information asymmetry creates the need for regulation13. With foodstuffs and medicines, consumer protection laws are widely accepted because of these information diffi culties14. However, even if we agree on the necessity to regulate food and medicine businesses, particular policies are still not free from controversy15. For example, insistence on safe medicines and functional foods may prevent useful but slightly risky substances from reaching the market16.Procedural rules are also important as they defi ne how substantial rules are implemented in practice. When implementing safety and effi cacy requirements, the legislator must decide whether to rely on pre-market control or post-market control. Pre-market authorisation is often preferred today. Innovative functional foods must be authorised in both the EU and China before being marketed to consumers.Legislators must also resolve the appropriate level and type of regulations.
