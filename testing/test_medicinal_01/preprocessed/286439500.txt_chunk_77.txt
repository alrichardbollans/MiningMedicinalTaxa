The threshold concentrationfor this effect was equal to or below 20 ug/ml of the extract(which was the lowest concentration tested) and reached aplateau with 60 and 200 ug/ml. Quantitative results were asfollows (expressed as % of the maximal spasm): 18.8 +- 3.1%at 20 ug/ml (N = 6), 40.1 +- 3.3% at 60 ug/ml (N = 11), and36.3 +- 4.9% at 200 ug/ml (N = 7). A second administrationof the same concentration after a 40-min washout periodusually had a qualitatively similar effect. Yet, because ofvariable reproducibility, we examined the effects on separatepreparations with only one administration of the extract.The solvent of the extract (DMSO; 0.3 or 1 ul/ml) caused noor minimal contraction (on average, 0 and 2%, respectively;N = 12).The 60 ug/ml concentration of the extract was used forpharmacological analysis. Both atropine (0.5 uM), an antagonistof acetylcholine at the muscarinic receptors and tetrodotoxin(0.5 uM), an inhibitor of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels (hence,of neuronal axonal conduction) inhibited the contractile effectof RC crude extract. In contrast, the purinoceptor antagonistPPADS (50 uM) or a combination of serotonin (5-HT) receptorantagonists methysergide (0.3 uM), SB204070 (1 uM) andY25130 (1 uM) failed to influence the contractile effect ofthe extract (Table 3). This combination of 5-HT antagonists issuitable for blocking the contractile effect of 5-HT (Sandor et al.,2016).The functional blockade of capsaicin-sensitive neurons didnot inhibit the contractile effect of the RC extract (Bartho et al.,2004) as compared to time-matched, solvent-treated controls(Table 3).

Fraction F20 induced a moderate contraction(approximately 20% of the maximum) (Table 4). Similarresults were obtained with F40, F60, F80, and F100, although theextent of contraction tended to decline with F60, F80, and F100.Our experiments revealed the smooth muscle relaxing activityof RC extract, fractions and essential oil in this experimentalsetting. On histamine-precontracted preparations (treated with0.5 uM histamine for 15 min, in the presence of atropineand tetrodotoxin, both 0.5 uM), concentration-dependentrelaxation was observed in response to treatment with RC crudeextract (60-200 ug/ml) (Figure 3 and Table 5). The highestconcentration tested induced full relaxation. The relaxationdetected with the 20ug/ml test sample did not exceed the changesevoked by the solvent itself (1 ul/ml DMSO; see below). In severalcases the relaxation was preceded by a little contraction. Therelaxation induced by the 60 ug/ml extract was not significantlyaltered by the adrenergic b-receptor antagonist propranolol(1 uM; 51.3 +- 7.8% relaxation, N = 6) or by the NO synthaseinhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine (100 uM; 47.4 +- 7.4% relaxation,FIGURE 2 | Contractile effect of RC extract (60 ug/ml, added at the squaresymbol) on the guinea pig ileum.

All the flavonoids exerted a dual effect on theguinea pig ileum, i.e., a short-lived contraction at basal toneand a long-lasting relaxation on the histamine-pre-contracted,atropine- and tetrodotoxin-pretreated preparations (Table 7).
