It is an epistemological battleground of truth politics in which the established is contrasted against the esoteric, the rationalist against the vitalist, the mainstream against the alternative, or the accepted against the radical, as various sets of competing explanations of efficacy for particular treatments vie for 'plausibility'. It is also a battleground in which attempts at combining different approaches to explaining a treatment's effects are made. And as we saw in the previous chapter, it is often argued that in the process of being mainstreamed, previously marginalised and esoteric bodies of knowledge are being biomedically colonised and thereby stripped of their epistemologically distinctive value. For example, when the effects of acupuncture are investigated in terms of its effects on the stimulation of endorphin receptors rather than energy flows along vital meridians, when the efficacy of St. John's Wort is accounted for in 160 terms of a regulation of the reuptake of serotonin rather than the nourishing of the body's battered nervous system, or when treatment effects arising from homeopathic remedies which "may not contain even a single molecule of the active principle" (Great Britain. Parliament. House of Lords. Select Committee on Science and Technology. 2000: 4.35) are ascribed wholly to spill-over placebo effects rather than to Hahnemann's law of similars, critics argue that the teachings of traditional Chinese medicine, herbalism and homeopathy are pretty much bypassed, eventually reducing these vitalistic treatments to the mechanistic explanations of biomedicine.93 In this chapter, rather than making any attempt at evaluating the validity of particular explanations of efficacy, I will focus my attention on the concrete practices of 'pre-clinical' validation that have contributed to the emergence of St. John's Wort and Heantos as two prominent herbal remedies in the British and Vietnamese contexts respectively. In doing so, I will show how herbalists, ethno-botanists, phytochemists, pharmacologists and clinicians have often joined forces in the as yet unfinished attempts to explain how these two remedies work. This is not to say that there has necessarily been a complete consensus as to what are seen as the most important mechanisms of action at play in the treatment of addiction and depression, but whatever the 'incommensurability', this does not seem to have prevented cooperation between herbalists and scientists. Moreover, as the hypericin and hyperforin hypotheses in pharmacological St. John's Wort research have shown, diverging explanations of mechanisms of action can also emerge within a supposedly coherent biomedical approach, as can models based on the 'synergistic' workings of multiple active ingredients. Having said this, it will be an important part of this chapter to show how differing conceptions of the ways in which a plant's different components work to elicit a therapeutic response come into play in what I will argue has been a steadily intensifying disciplining of medicinal herbs in both Vietnam and the United Kingdom. There are three particular routes to this disciplining that I will highlight in the following. The first pertains to the 20th century appearance of the so-called ethno-sciences. These 93 For example, in the context of recent efforts to modernise Chinese medicine, Kaptchuk argues that such approaches "are aimed at separating out the effective components of Chinese medicine and introducing them into the framework of modern Western medicine... Yet, although this knowledge, with its use of traditional herbs and acupuncture, has the veneer of Chinese medicine, the actual application and methodology are clearly Western in orientation. The theory of Yin and Yang and other traditional concepts are left behind" (1983: 24). 161 sciences emerged to counteract problems related to accessing knowledge and expertise that has not necessarily accumulated in an organised and documented form, but has instead been passed down orally through the generations, for example, via herbal apprenticeships. The emergence of ethno-botany, ethno-biology, ethno-pharmacognosy and ethno-pharmacology as specific sub-disciplines in the early 20th century can be understood as a bio-scientific response to a perceived value in what had previously been disregarded as little more than the superstitions of the thousands of ethnic groups found throughout not just the so-called 'developing world' but also in many industrialised countries. As we saw in chapter 4, in both the United Kingdom and Vietnam, specific efforts have been made to scientifically collate and tap into the 'indigenous knowledge' of ethnic and lay groups. Secondly, following Kinghorn (2004), I will argue that the disciplining of herbs in both countries in the latter half of the 20th century has increasingly shifted from a molar botanical level towards a molecular bio-chemical level. As such, the isolation, characterisation and structure elucidation of active ingredients found in ethno-botanically identified medicinal plants have become central elements in the continuing development of herbal remedies today, including St. John's Wort and Heantos. Interestingly, the intensification of this chromatographic phytochemical mapping of medicinal plants has been in part facilitated by the rejection of the so-called 'waste hypothesis' of natural products chemistry. According to this hypothesis, only a plant's primary metabolites (e.g. carbohydrates, proteins) were of scientific interest while its many secondary metabolites (e.g. alkaloids, flavonoids, carotenoids) were nothing more than the plant's waste products, analogous to animals' excrement. Today, phytochemists ascribe plants' secondary metabolites a protective function in warding off herbivores, fighting off parasites or killing off microbes, and as such have become the object of increased pharmacological research. However, some herbalists argue against this defence-hypothesis, alternatively suggesting that the fact that plants produce substances that have "no apparent role in the plants themselves" yet are "physically healing and spiritually enhancing for human beings" represents yet more evidence of a universal balance and harmony between "plant and human realms" (McIntyre 1988: 38-9). Finally, I will argue that in the search for "plausible mechanisms of action" there has been a specific emphasis on identifying possible bio-physiological pathways to explain the efficacy of herbal remedies such as St. John's Wort and Heantos, which in turn underpins 162 assumptions about the conditions to which the therapies in question relate, e.g. depression and addiction. For, in accounting for the therapeutic work that the ingestion of St. John's Wort and Heantos - whether taken as a tincture, a tea or a standardised, dried extract capsule - can instigate physiologically, scientists argue that a herbal remedy contains within it a curative potential (in the form of active chemical compounds) that will be released as the remedy enters the body, becomes bioavailable and thereby influences otherwise independent physiological workings. It is as a direct result of such physiological changes that pharmacologists argue the experience of depression or addiction in a suffering subject will be affected in a therapeutically significant way.94 Mapping out this chain of events, increasingly at the molecular level, is of course the domain of a range of specialist sciences from phytochemistry to toxicology and pharmacology (including pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacognosy), each of which has become important in the ongoing development of St. John's Wort and Heantos. But it is also, as we will see, in the pharmacological description of mechanisms of action that contestations have arisen over 'additive' as opposed to 'dynamic' synergism between a plant's or plant mixture's multiple active ingredients. Prospecting ethno-knowledge It is an oft-cited wisdom in the field of herbal medicine that if a remedy is still around after centuries of documented use, then there must be something to it.95 Indeed, so persuasive is this argument that it has played an important part in what Parry (2004: 150) has called a "resurgence of interest in collecting biological materials" for medicinal or industrial use in the latter part of the 20th century. There is of course nothing new in the fact that medicinal firms and practitioners look to plants in their quest for novel compounds to fight disease (morphine, aspirin and digitalis being cases in point), but what has been especially characteristic of this more recent resurgence of what has come to be known as 'bio-prospecting' is the systematised role that traditional knowledge - as handed down or recorded through the generations - has come to play in the initial identification and/or screening of suitable plant leads when faced with an incredibly lush global bio-diversity.96 More often than not, it has been patent-hunting multinational companies that have come 94 It is this experience of addiction and depression, as shown in chapter 5, that clinicians have measured in clinical trials with Heantos and St. John's Wort. 95 My sincere thanks to Chris Hamilton for helping me to develop my argument in this section. 96 Of the world's 250,000 or so species of higher plants only 6% have been investigated for their biological activity (Heinrich, et al. 2004: 289). 163 under fire from accusations of "bio-piracy" and of "colonising life itself", whereby custodians of traditional knowledge are seen to have been cheated of rightful compensation for their imparted knowledge while companies profit from the monopolisation of an intellectual commons (see Parry 2004; Shiva 1997). However, we will see in the following how St. John's Wort and Heantos both provide interesting appendages to ongoing debates about the thin lines that currently separate bio-prospecting/piracy. As we will recall from chapters 4 and 5, efforts to revitalise Vietnamese traditional medicine since the mid 1950s have first and foremost relied on a comprehensive mapping out effort that took herbalists, botanists and other scientists to the rural areas of Vietnam in an attempt to record the experiences and knowledge of traditional practitioners, which would otherwise be lost or at best benefit a very limited population. As such this was in many ways what the 19th century botanist John Harshberger would have called an ethno-botanic project - a "study of plants used by primitive and aboriginal people" (1896) - albeit very much stripped of Harshberger's outmoded evolutionary assumptions. To explain the launching of the Vietnamese government's national ethno-botanic programme, Minister of Health Pham Ngoc Thach argued that: the scorn of Western-trained physicians for traditional medicine derives from an erroneous conception of science and a profound ignorance of the results obtained by traditional medicine... I would like to draw attention to the extreme richness of the vegetal pharmacopoeia of traditional medicine. Naturally, one cannot experiment on all these vegetal varieties one after another. The age-old experience of the people and physicians of the traditional school comes into play here... There is a danger of letting this age-old knowledge of medicine disappear rapidly, because if we don't cultivate it those who practice it will have disappeared after ten or twenty years. (Pham 1965: 13-5) In other words, this was not a national study of how "primitive" peoples used plants, rather it was a case of what in more recent times has come to be described as ethnopharmacology and ethnopharmacognosy. These latter two ethno-sciences concern the study of all "biologically active agents traditionally employed or observed by man" (Heinrich, et al. 2004: 52), and the study of those biologically active agents used specifically for medicinal purposes, respectively. What makes them 'ethno' sciences is their focus on culturally transmitted traditional knowledge not only as a matter of cultural heritage, but also as an important ally in the search for ecologically, industrially and/or medically relevant active compounds. This approach was of course also the one chosen by herbalist Tran Khuong 164 Dan as he traversed Vietnam in the 1980s looking for possible leads that could help him in his efforts to develop a herbal remedy against addiction. In the United Kingdom, on the other hand, as we saw earlier, the first attempts to collate knowledge about medicinally useful plants into a standard pharmacopoeia in the 1960s relied primarily on bibliographic reviews of existing documentation, such as the numerous herbals and botanic guides that had been published throughout the past few centuries. This has certainly been the case with a herb like St. John's Wort, with documentation of its medicinal use spanning two millennia.97 Yet, notwithstanding the existence of relatively comprehensive medicinal plant documentation, some thirty years after the Vietnamese government had launched its ethno-pharmacological programme, a number of researchers from the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, the National Institute of Medical Herbalists, the Herb Society, the Chelsea Physic Garden and Neal's Yard Remedies joined forces to form an Ethnomedica research group in 1999, eventually launching a programme called "Remembered Remedies - Researching the Herbal Traditions of Britain". Their rationale for doing so was not unlike that of the Vietnamese government's: 150 years ago, Britain was still mainly a rural society. Lives and activities were defined by the seasons and everyone knew the names and uses of several common wayside plants. Within two generations of the industrial revolution most of the population had moved into cities. As people developed an urban lifestyle they lost contact with the land and their practical herbal traditions. Not just forgotten but no longer accessible - where was the nearest dandelion, dock, healing tree or stream for watercress?... The loss of local knowledge - be it about plants or anything else - is one of the side-effects of globalisation and rapidly changing societies. While this issue is recognised in the tropics, and is receiving a lot of attention from those concerned with development and the conservation of cultural and biological diversity, it is not the case here at home. The UK has long been industrialised and ranks among the most developed of regions. Yet studies have shown that fragments of knowledge passed down through a long oral tradition still exist among older people. Its value increases the more it is lost as time passes. (Ethnomedica 1999) In the three-year period 2003-2006, over one thousand records of medicinal plant use gleaned from survey cards that had been distributed widely by a group of 13 researchers as 97 In this connection it should be pointed out that although there has been a particular emphasis on ethno-botanic expeditions in Vietnam, there also exists extensive bibliographic documentation going back many centuries on the use of medicinal plants with countless treatises and texts, both specific to Vietnam but also concerning the teachings of Chinese medicine (see chapter 4). These texts have also played an important role in ongoing ethno-pharmacological efforts to organise and collate knowledge about Vietnam's materia medica. 165 well by the Kew gardens, were collated and organised, allowing researchers to produce a list of the top 15 most-mentioned plants. These included feverfew, dock, onion, sage and nettle. Importantly, bearing in mind the controversies over bio-prospecting/bio-piracy alluded to above, contributors of knowledge were asked to sign a consent form confirming that they were "happy for information I give to the project to be published... on the internet, so that it is available for posterity" (ibid.). Scientists at Kew gardens have also been able to use the information gathered as a means of screening potential plant candidates for further phytochemical research into therapeutically active compounds. For example, Professor Monique Simmonds of Kew gardens explains that "sage is a herb that has been connected with wisdom down the ages, and now for the first time we can see whether it really helps with cognitive ability, or memory" (cited in Revill 2005). And so, in both the United Kingdom and in Vietnam ethno-sciences have been deployed as a specific means to document, organise and archive for posterity the kind of information about the medicinal uses of plants that is otherwise seen as at risk of being lost as yet another side effect of globalisation and modernisation processes. At the same time, it is fair to say that there has been a particular focus on traditional knowledge specifically concerning the medicinal use of plants in more rural areas of the two countries. Indeed, it is often the status and patentability of any resulting industrially or pharmaceutically useful products stemming from such ethno-knowledge that is at stake in debates about the ethics of bio-prospecting. How, with whom and to what extent any (usually financial) benefits that these products might bring in their wake should be shared and made available are some of the questions that are often raised. For example, should Heantos inventor Tran Khuong Dan, co-author on a patent registered at the national patent office in Vietnam together with scientists at the Institute of Chemistry, who invested great personal sacrifice in the years that he spent developing his remedy, be obligated to share any benefits with the traditional practitioners he interacted with during his travels throughout Vietnam? Is this at all the way in which to pose the question? And who should benefit from any future pharmaceutical products that might arise thanks to knowledge collected from the Remembered Remedies programme? How about profits from the sale of St. John's Wort products, whose knowledge has enabled it? These are the kinds of complex debates about ownership, exploitation and commodification of traditional knowledge that the ethno-sciences have brought in their wake. 166 Heinrich et al. (2004) have argued that within these debates one should distinguish between bio-prospecting and ethnopharmacology as two distinct methodologies for the exploitation of traditional knowledge. The former, they suggest, focuses on the development of drugs by way of assay-screening large quantities of biogenic substances (often though not always identified with the help of traditional practitioners via ethno-scientist 'middle men') for any biological activities, with the objective of discovering new single-compound drugs for mainly industrialised markets. Companies such as Shaman Pharmaceuticals and Phytopharm as well as government-sponsored initiatives like Costa Rica's National Biodiversity Institute who partner with pharmaceutical companies, have been famous for using bio-prospecting as a kind of 'business model', and it is sometimes suggested that the pragmatic focus on a people's use of plants that the sub-discipline of ethno-botany pioneered in the early part of the 20th century has been particularly facilitating for this.98 By employing what eventually came to be termed a "chemical prospecting", "biodiversity prospecting" or "bio-prospecting" approach, initiatives such as these argued that their competitive advantage came from the fact that they started not just from a random library of chemicals, but rather from extracts of plants with a "history of medicinal use", which gave them a head start in R&D endeavours to either isolate a single active compound to develop a prescription medicine or develop a standardised extract of the plant for commercial sale (see Reid and World Resources Institute 1993). Already in the mid-20th century, however, this almost exclusive ethno-botanical focus on use was seen as having come at the neglect of a more rigorous anthropological understanding of the cognitive frameworks and local conditions within which these medicinal plants occupy particular symbolic and ecological functions.
