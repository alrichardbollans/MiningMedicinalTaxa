Opening lecture6thCongress of Pharmacy in Macedonia with international participationMacedonian pharmaceutical bulletin, 62 (suppl) 7 - 8 (2016)ISSN 1409 - 8695UDC: 615.15Short communicationThe modern pharmacist: Is the future in the past?Roberto FrontiniCentre for Patient Safety, University Hospital of Leipzig, Liebigstrasse20, 04103 Leipzig, GermanyBackgroundThe role of the pharmacist changed during the centu-ries. In the 20th century most of the pharmacists accepted a role as provider of medicines and the education was miss-ing any clinical aspect. But looking back to the 18th century in Italy we discover that the role of the pharmacist was dif-ferent and similar to what should be the modern profession. In the statute of the Ospedale Maggiore della SS Annunzia-ta di Savigliano (1762) was indeed stated: "The pharmacist must accompany the physician in all rounds...and more he will make daily additional rounds to judge the pain of the most worsening patients and their immediate needs..".The pharmacist had an important clinical role and was a partner of the physician. Even more is part of the agreement be-tween the Ospedale Maggiore della SS Trinita di Fossano and Gino Stefano Bertolo, speziale (pharmacist) (1741): "... he has to prepare the prescribed medicines... and bring them personally to the patients labelling every cup or de-canter with the number of his or her bed and compassion-ately and gently inviting to take them either immediately or at least at time of the mass in the cathedral...". The con-tract describes in fact the competencies of a modern phar-macist. He or she is the expert in preparing medicines and understands the formulation as an important issue. But his or her commitment does not end in the preparation. He or she has to go to the patient and promote adherence and best use of the medicine while using strategies for the reduction of medication errors.The challenge to speak about the fu-ture is not to re-invent the past.The environment of the 18th century was indeed dif-ferent to what we have nowadays and in this short article I would like to underline some of the challenges of a mod-ern pharmacist both in the hospital as well as in the com-munity setting. I think thatin the whole system the phar-macist should be the healthcare professional in the care team who seeks to ensure that pharmacologically active in-gredients achieve the best possible benefit for the individ-ual patient. The competencies of a modern PharmacistThe pharmacist needs first skills and competence in the formulation of a medicine. This does not necessarily mean in the era of industrial production that the medicine is compounded in the pharmacy, but the properties of the formulation may influence the correct use and the adher-ence as well. Only the pharmacist can understand this in deep. Sometime is also necessary to adapt medicine to the individual, especially in paediatric patients. Skills in com-pounding are therefore of primary importance and also the modern pharmacist should not forget the roots of our pro-fession as the only manufacturer of medicines.A further taskfor a pharmacist is to seek the balance between expected effects and drug related problems. It is essential to underline that the best outcome for patients is only achievable in a multidisciplinary care team (Zuling et al., 2013) and the pharmacist as part of this team should be alert when advising patients. He or she needs social com-petence in communication with the aim to understand any problem related to the medication and explain the appro-priate use of drugs to the patient "..in terms he can under-stand" (EAHP, 2014). This social competence is also nec-essary in the team work. Physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals have to abandon a hier-archy driven relationship and accept each other as a partner in achieving the best for the patient. As well the patient has to be part of any decision and has to articulate the desired outcome. Especially in oncology those expectations should be respected and the goal for the care team is not necessar-ily to prolonger life but to create quality of life. OL 18Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 7 - 8 (2016)Dr. Roberto FrontiniThe challenges of a modern PharmacistIn the daily work the modern way of life and technol-ogy challenge the modern pharmacist. The daily increas-ing knowledge about drugs and their effect, complex med-ications, personalised medicines,IT technology, the over-whelming information through social media, the explosion of costs hampering healthcare systems, the globalisation of the supply chainare some examples. One example of personalised medicine may underline those challenges: Enthusiastic researchers believed that we are "on the leading edge of a true revolution in medicine" (Collins, 2010) but critical authors say that "they can also obscure more effective approaches to common complex disorders" (Juengst et al., 2012). What is true? We do not know yet as data are contradictory. But an interesting pa-per on the adherence to the targeting INR in Warfarin med-ication may show the dilemma (Kimmel et al., 2013). Kim-mel et al. (2013) explored two different approaches to con-trol Warfarin medication: the first based on the genomic of the patients, the second based on clinical interventions. In average no difference was found between the two groups bringing to the conclusion that "genotype-guided dosing of warfarin did not improve anticoagulation control". Inter-estingly in the subgroup of black patients the mean percent-age of time in the therapeutic range was less in the geno-type-guided group than in the clinically guided group. This example may underline that clinical interventions are still important even if our knowledge of genomics helps us to make better decisions. The modern pharmacist has to con-sider this while advising patients. In another paper (Wright et al., 2013) Wright concluded that "Our ability to generate data now far outstrips our ability to interpret it".A second example of challenge for the modern phar-macist is the information technology of today. No doubt that internet and social media have completely changed our sources of information. The modern patient is informed and internet is after the physician the first source of informa-tion according to a study by Marrie (2013). There is some differences between young and old people (Couper et al., 2010) and persons with mental disease (e.g. depression) (Pohjanoksa-Mantyla et al., 2011), the last using more and more the internet as an information source. But the qual-ity of the internet information is not necessarily the best. Celebrities e.g. misuse their influence promoting products without scientific evidence (Hoffman and Tan, 2013) and for non-healthcare professionals is not easy to distinguish between spam and real scientific message. The challenge is for the modern pharmacist that patient sometime know more than the healthcare professional but they do not un-derstand the background. The pharmacists as well as the physician must learn comprehensive, clear and for the pa-tient understandable communication and educate him or her in the proper use of internet-information. This is no easy task as demonstrated by Watermeyerand Penn (2009). Healthcare professional's education should therefore in-clude communication training as an essential part for the transfer of scientific data to the patient.ConclusionIn conclusion between a medicine with its active in-gredient and the outcome of the patient there are a lot of barriers like e.g. drug formulation, patient attitude, social context, medication errors, patient's genomic, biased infor-mation. The pharmacist has to help patients in overcoming such barriers but this is only possible if he or she is part of a cure team working in collaborative way without hierar-chy barriers.ReferencesCollins, F.S., 2010.
