None of the synthesized substances produced any sig-nificant gastric lesions. The changes observed were in range of 0-1 according to the Adami's scoring scale. MDA val-ues for all compounds except for compound 2 were lower than for ibuprofen. GSH level is increased in groups treat-ed with ibuprofen, compounds 1, 2 and 6 compared to the control group. The level of GSH in groups treated with oth-er compounds is similar to the control group. OSI was very high In gastric mucosa of animals received compounds 1 (186.45), 3 (132.6), 6 (137.4) and 7 (114.8) which means that these compounds produce good protection against ox-idative stress in gastric tissue. In this respect compounds 2 (61.0) and 5 (48.0) produced more oxidative stress in gas-tric tissue than ibuprofen, while compound 4 (89.3) was on a pair with ibuprofen (79.9). ConclusionAlthough macroscopic examination of rat stomach showed that none of tested compounds produced any sig-nificant gastric lesions, biochemical parameters differen-tiated these compounds according to oxidative stress they produced. The obtained biochemical results indicated that ibuprofen produced significantly more oxidative stress in gastric tissue than four out of seven synthetized com-pounds. The results impose the conclusion that this four compounds exhibit better gastric tolerability than ibupro-fen. Using OSI to describe results is much more concise way to perceive oxidative stress than using MDA and GSH values separately.ReferencesAdami, E., Marazzi-Uberti, E., Turba, C., 1963.

The discovery of a prophylactic and a curative treatment for this disease still represents a challenge for the researchers. Another subject of scientific interest is the discovery of antitumoral agents of natural origin with potent anticancer activity and low/no toxic effects against normal cells. Betulin is a natural compound, member of the pentacyclic triterpene family, obtained in high yields from the bark of the birch tree (Krol et al., 2015). Betulin is known for its multiple pharmacological effects, including: anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anticancer and antiangiogenic effects (Dehelean et al., 2013; Krol et al., 2015). The use of betulin as an anticancer agent presents multiple advantages (potent anticancer effects and no toxicity in vitro against healthy cells and in vivo even at high doses), but one of its major disadvantages is its low water solubility, which limits its administration in vivo. A goal of the researchers was to find a proper formulation to increase betulin solubility in aqueous solutions what leads to increased bioavailability and higher antitumor activity. The aim of our study was to obtain a silver nanoformu-lation of betulin and to verify its pharmacological effects in vitro on a human lung carcinoma cell line - A549. Materials and methodsIn this study we used A549 human lung carcinoma cells. The cell line was purchased from ECACC (European Collection of Cell Cultures) at passage no. 39. A549 cells were kept in liquid nitrogen and one week before the ex-periment started, we cultured in specific medium culture.The cells were cultured in high glucose (4.5 g/l) Dul-becco's modified Eagle Medium (DMEM - Sigma Aldrich, Germany) supplemented with 15 mM Hepes, 2 mM L-glu-tamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were kept in a hu-midified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 degC and were pas-saged every two days. Cells number was assessed by using Neubauer chamber in the presence of Trypan Blue.For the cell viability assay, the cells(10000 cells/ well) were cultured in 96-well plates and left for 24h to adhere. The cells were stimulated for 24 h with different concen-trations (10 and 50 uM) and were divided in the following groups: 1 - cells stimulated with DMSO (dimethylsulfox-ide), 2 - cells stimulated with betulin dissolved in DMSO, 3 - cells stimulated with silver nanoformulation blank and 4 - cells stimulated with betulin silver nanoformulation. The cells viability was assessed by Alamar blue and MTT methods. It was also tested the effect of the new formula-tion against the migration capacity of the cells by scratch assay and pictures were taken at different time points: 0h, 3h, 8h and 24h.Results and discussionStimulation of the A549 cells with different concen-trations of betulin silver nanoformulation (10 and 50 uM) for 24h induced cytotoxicity of the cells in a dose-depen-dent manner. These results were compared with the results obtained after the stimulation with betulin dissolved in di-methylsulfoxide (DMSO), the solvent in which betulin has an increased solubility and the cytotoxic effect was higher S6 PP 282590Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 589 - 590 (2016)Clinical pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular sciencesPoster presentationsin the case of the nanoformulation.It was also tested the effect of these formulations against the capacity of migration of the A549 cells by the means of scratch assay and it was observed that at the smallest concentration used in the study, the nanoformula-tion was able to inhibit the migration of the cells. Other studies developed on human lung carcinoma showed that betulin solved in DMSO had cytotoxic and anti-migratory effects (Rzeski et al., 2009). The anticancer mechanism of action of betulin is still unknown and sev-eral studies proposed as mechanism of action induction of apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (Pyo et al., 2009). Another mechanism of action of betulin was the inhibition of tumor cells proliferation through activation of AMPK signaling (Li et al., 2014).ConclusionOur results showed that betulin formulated as a sil-ver nanoformulation had a potent antiproliferative effect against human lung carcinoma cell line - A549 after 24h stimulation. Further studies will be realized in order to elu-cidate the anticancer mechanism of action of betulin and for the evaluation of the in vivo effects in animal models with human lung carcinoma.This research was supported by the PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-2842 grant, no. 180/2015.

Richard Bright first described the as-sociation of pericarditis with renal failure in his land-mark observation of 100 cases of patients with 'albumin-ous urine', which appeared in the Guys Hospital Report of 1836 (Bright, 1836). Autopsy studies demonstrated pericarditis or pericardial effusion in 37 of these patients. ,,Uremic pericarditis" is a term used to describe patients who develop clinical manifestations of pericarditis before renal replacement therapy or within 8 weeks of its initia-tion. ,,Dialysis pericarditis" is used for patients who de-velop clinical features of pericarditis after being stabilized on dialysis usually after 8 weeks of its initiation (Barach, 1922).Though several therapeutic modalities have been used to treat uremic and dialysis pericarditis and pericar-dial effusion, initial treatment of pericarditis is usually de-termined by the hemodynamic stability of the patient. In azotemic patients pericarditis is due to number of causes including infection, diseases like systemic lupus erythro-matosis (SLE), or to uremic toxins itself. The incidence of acute pericardial disease punctuating chronic renal fail-ure is decreasing because of effective dialysis and renal transplantation; approximately 20% of uremic patients re-quiring chronic dialysis develop pericarditis.It is surpris-ing that even though pericardial involvement remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patientswith end stage renal disease (ESRD), the academic interest and the literature regarding the same has reduced over the past few years. During 1995 and 1998, less than 1% of the 650 authors discussing pericarditis were specifically related to uremic pericarditis uremia one of main complications in patients with terminal chronic kidney insufficiency is ure-mic pericarditis which usually is presented as acute uremic pericarditis but sometimes it can be chronic constrictive pericarditis with pericardial effusions.Uremic pericarditis is caused from renal insufficien-cy either acute or chronic as result of inflammation of vis-ceral and parietal layers by uremic toxin and disorders of urea and creatinine metabolism which are highly elevated in uremic patients. Uremic patients treated with hemodi-alysis can develop chonstrictive uremic pericarditis. Defin-itive cause of uremic pericarditis is still unknown. Many studies have documented that the onset of uremic pericar-ditis in uremic patients treated with HD is result of termi-nal renal disease and inadequate Hemodialysis(HD) ses-sions where enough amounts of fluid are not eliminated, volemic overload with secondary hyper-tension and over-weight between HD intervals. Some authors suggest that uremic pericarditis can be result of retention of uremic tox-ins in organism.Symptoms are pain pericarditis uremic presented with different intensity, which is alleviated when the patient is sitting or leaning forward. Clinical signs of pericarditis in patients with renal disease terminals (ESRD treat my chronic hemodialysis are similar to signs observed from other causes. Most patients complain of fever and pain pleural chest, the intensity of which is very different. the pain is localized in the region pericardial and may resemble the pain of angina pectoris. When developing effusionmas-sivepericardial may also appear dyspnea and heart failure.

However, although there are documented facts that all patients with terminal renal disease treated me with recurrent pericarditis chronic he-modialysis may not manifest symptoms.
