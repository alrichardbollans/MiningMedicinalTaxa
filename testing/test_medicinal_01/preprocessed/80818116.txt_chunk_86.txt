Diazepam is lipophilic drug that is weak base and it is used in the treatment of maternal eclampsia and as a premedication in cesarean section de-liveries. Diazepam readily crosses the blood-brain barri-er and the placenta by passive diffusion. It is also excreted into breast milk and studies showed that diazepam reaches equilibrium in the feto-maternal systemic circulation 10-15 minutes after intravenous administration (Bakke et al., 1992). Also, some diseases such as diabetes and hyperten-sion have been associated to impaired placental composi-tion and functions. Previous studies carried out in our lab-oratories have demonstrated impaired drug permeation in diabetic animals. The development and progression of di-abetes have been associated with disturbed drug absorp-tion due to dysfunctional protein expression and function-ality, impaired transcellular transport and intercellular traf-ficking as well as altered gut physiology (Al-Salami et al., 2009). The aim of this study was to investigate the influ-ence of diabetes and hypertension on the placental perme-ation of diazepam.Materials and methodsPregnant women were recruited from the Gynecology and Obstetric Clinic in Vojvodina, Serbia. Pregnant wom-en scheduled for cesarean section, those who were diag-nosed with gestational or arterial hypertension as well as those who were diagnosed gestational diabetes were in-cluded in this study. The study protocol was approved by Ethic Committee of the Gynecology and Obstetistric clinic in Vojvodina (Ndeg00-08/9) and informed consents were ob-tained from each participant before inclusion in the study. A total 75 pregnant women were divided into three groups: group 1 (healthy control, n=31), group 2 (diabetic, n=14) and group 3 (hypertensive, n=30). Two sets of diazepam plasma samples were collected and measured (after the ad-ministration single dose of 5 mg/day intramuscularly), be-fore (t1), during (t2) and after delivery (t3). The first set of blood samples was taken from the mother (maternal ve-nous). The second set of samples was taken from the fetus (fetal umbilical veins and arteries). Diazepam concentra-tions in plasma were measured by modified HPLC meth-od previously described (Rouini et al., 2008). Pharmacoki-netic parameters were calculated using non compartmen-tal analyses using with WinNonLin version 4.1 (SCI soft-ware, Pharsight Corporation, Gary, NC, USA). Values of AUCs after delivery were taken as a measure of diazepam elimination from blood. In order to assess the effect of dia-betes and hypertension on diazepam placental-permeation, the ratios of fetal to maternal blood concentrations were determined. Also umbilical cord arterial to umbilical cord venous concentration ratio was determined as a measure of diazepam uptake, distribution and/or metabolism in neo-nates. Data were analyzed by ANOVA test and differences were considered statistically significant if p<=0.05.Results and discussionAll neonates were similar in length, weight and body surface area values. Also, there were no statistically signif-icant differences neither in height, weight nor body surface S4 PP 171364Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 363 - 364 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsarea of the women between three investigated groups. The diabetic and hypertensive groups have 2-fold increase in the fetal umbilical-venous concentrations, compared to the maternal venous concentrations. Feto: maternal plasma-concentrations ratios were higher in diabetic (2.01+-1.01) and hypertensive (2.26+-1.23) groups compared with con-trol (1.30+-0.48) while, there was no difference in ratios between the diabetic and hypertensive groups. Umbili-cal-cord arterial: venous ratios (within each group) were similar among all groups (control: 0.97+-0.32; hyperten-sive: 1.08+-0.60 and diabetics1.02+-0.77) and there were no statistically significant differences. There were statistical-ly significant higher AUCs values before delivery in con-trol and hypertension group compared to diabetes group. Meaning that transfer of diazepam in diabetic group was higher even though exposure was lower probably due to increased permeability of placenta in diabetic women. Val-ues of AUCs after delivery were statistically higher in con-trol group compared to hypertension and diabetes group, but there were no statistical differences between hyperten-sion and diabetes group. These results implies that elimina-tion of diazepam from central compartment is higher in hy-pertension and diabetes group and that is likely that there were more unbound diazepam in the blood in these groups, since total clearance of diazepam is directly proportional to free diazepam fraction (Riss et al., 2008).ConclusionOn line with our previous findings which demonstrate disturbed transcellular trafficking of lipophilic drugs in di-abetes, this study shows significant increase in diazepam placental-permeation in diabetic and hypertensive preg-nant women suggesting poor transcellular control of drug permeation and flux, and bigger exposure of the fetus to drug-placental transport.AcknowledgmentThis work was supported by the Ministry of Educa-tion, Science and Technological Development of Serbia (III 41012).ReferencesBakke, O.M., Haram, K., 1982.

One of the strategies to improve its dissolution rate includes development of self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS). SMEDDS are isotropic mixtures of oil, surfactant, cosurfactant, and a drug, that under dilution in vivo can spontaneously form microemulsions with droplet size less than 50 nm (Gursoy and Benita, 2004; Hauss, 2007). The aim of this study was to formulate and characterize self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems of simvastatin with increased dissolution rate of simvastatin.Materials and methodsMaterialsSimvastatin (Ph. Eur. grade) was obtained from Hemofarm a.d. (Serbia). Caprylocaproyl macrogol-8 glycerides (Labrasol(r)), propylene glycol monocaprylate (Capryol(tm) PGMC) and oleoyl macrogol-6 glycerides (Labrafil(r) M1944CS) were obtained from Gattefosse (France). Polysorbate 80 was obtained from Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Germany). MethodsFormulation and preparation of SMEDDSSurfactant phase of Labrasol(r) as surfactant and Poly-sorbate 80 as cosurfactant were mixed at fixed weight ratio 3:1. Oil (Capryol(tm) PGMC or Labrafil(r) M1944CS) was then added to surfactant phase at varios ratios (from 9:1 to 1:9) and mixed on magnetic stirrer. After preparation, all samples were titrated with highly purified water drop by drop. Two single-phase, transparent systems are consid-ered to be microemulsions and selected for further inves-tigations. Both samples contained 67.5% Labrasol, 22.5% Polisorbat 80 and 10% oil (Capryol(tm) PGMC-sample F1 or Labrafil(r) M1944CS-sample F2). Simvastatin (5% w/w) was dissolved in these selected SMEDDS by constant mix-ing on magnetic stirrer at 50-60 degC until a clear solution was obtained (samples F1s and F2s).SMEDDS characterizationDroplet size determinationBoth, unloaded and simvastatin-loaded SMEDDS were diluted with highly purified water (1:10). The aver-age droplet size (Z-ave) and polydispersity index (PDI) of unloaded and simvastatin-loaded systems were determined immediately after dilution by photon correlation spectros-copy (NanoZS90, Malvern Instruments, UK) at wave-length of 633 nm and a scattering angle of 90 deg. The results were the mean and standard deviation (S.D.) of three con-secutive measurements for each sample.In vitro dissolution studiesFor in vitro dissolution studies liquid SMEDDS with 20 mg of simvastatin were filled into hard gelatin capsules (size 0), and compared to commercially available tablet containing the same dose of simvastatin. The dissolution test was carried out using rotating pad-dle apparatus (Erweka DT70, Germany). The dissolution medium consisted of phosphate buffer pH 7.0, the volume S4 PP 172366Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 365 - 366 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationswas 900 ml, and the temperature of the dissolution medi-um was maintained at 37 degC with a rotating speed of 75 rpm. At fixed time intervals (5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and, 60 min), 10 ml samples were withdrawn from the dissolution medi-um and replaced by 10 ml of fresh phosphate buffer. Sink conditions were maintained at all times. All samples were filtered using membrane filter (0.45 mm MF-Millipore(r) membrane filter, Millipore Corporation, USA) and simvas-tatin concentration was determined spectrophotometrical-ly at 239 nm (Evolution 300, Termo Fisher Scientific, Eng-land). The dissolution experiments were carried out in trip-licate, and data were expressed as mean value +- S.D.Results and discussionDroplet size analysisThe average droplet size (nm) of samples F1, F1s, F2 and F2s were 18.58+-0.04, 46.41+-0.17, 11.68+-0.12 and 17.45+-0.04, respectively. It could be concluded that upon high water dilution both unloaded and drug-loaded SMEDDS are capable to form microemulsions, because the average droplet size is less than 50 nm (Gursoy and Benita, 2004; Hauss, 2007). Slightly higher droplet size of F1s, compared to unloaded F1, might be due to the inter-ference of the drug with self-emulsification process (Gur-soy and Benita, 2004).Polydispersity index represents the uniformity of droplet size within the formulation and for selected sam-ples F1, F1s, F2 and F2s were 0.155+-0.005, 0.286+-0.001, 0.137+-0.016 and 0.168+-0.005, respectively. Lower value of PDI in sample F2s indicated better uniformity of drop-let size, in comparison to formulation F1s. Both unloaded and SIM-loaded SMEDDS have shown monomodal drop-let size distribution.In vitro dissolution studyComparative in vitro dissolution profiles of simvastatin from SMEDDS filled in hard gelatin capsules and commercial (immediate release) tablet showed that simvastatin was completely released from both SMEDDS within first 5 minutes. The release rate of simvastatin from SMEDDS was significantly faster compared with commercially available tablet (approximately 14.57% after 1 hour), which might be due to the surfactants present in formulations. Karim et al. (2015) showed that the droplet size of the microemulsion could determine the rate and extent of simvastatin release, since the in vitro drug release was faster from formulations with smaller droplet size. However, in this study there was no significant difference in simvastatin release between two selected SMEDDS.ConclusionSelf-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) containing simvastatin were formulated and evaluated. Upon appropriate water dilution SMEDDS formed microemulsions with droplet size less than 50 nm. Although F2s had smaller droplet size and narrower drop-let size distribution, in vitro dissolution study revealed that simvastatin was completely released from both SMEDDS (F1s and F2s) in 5 minutes. These results indicated that de-velopment of SMEDDS could effectively enhance in vi-tro dissolution rate of simvastatin compared to commercial tablet and can be used as possible alternative.AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the project TR34007 (Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Devel-opment, RS).ReferencesGursoy, R.N., Benita, S., 2004.
