Bio-functional polymers have pharmaceutical interest in recent years and are widely used for formulation of modified release dosage forms (Meidan and Khan, 2007). Cellulose ethers are commonly employed as the hydrophilic, swellable and erodible matrix polymers for orally administered types of prolonged-re-lease systems (Ferrero Rodriguez et al., 2000). As water insol-uble excipients, ethylcellulose polymers (Ethocel) can effec-tively control the release of an active ingredient by modifying the size and length of diffusion path. By varying the type and amount of the insoluble excipient ratio and the particle size, a wide variety of release rate patterns can be achieved.The aim of the present study was to develop prolonged-release matrix tablets for water-soluble drug using hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose (Methocel) and Ethocel in order to re-duce dosing frequency, to lesser the side effects and to im-prove patient compliance.Materials and methodsMaterialsWater-soluble compound (API) was used as a model drug (solubility 10.2 mg/ml, pKa 10.26 and 9.12, Mw 473.49 g/mol, BCS Class III). The other excipients were: Methocel K100M (Colorcon, EU), Ethocel 7cPs FP (Colorcon, EU), Kollidon K90 (BASF, Germany), Avicel PH 112 (FMC Bio-polymer, USA), Aerosil 200 (Evonik, Germany) and Magne-sium stearate (Mg S) (Carsco GE, Italy). All the other chemi-cals used were of analytical grade.Preparation of matrix tablets by wet granulation techniqueThe tablets were prepared by wet granulation technique. The API and other excipients were accurately weighed and mixed in laboratory mixer granulator (Diosna Dierks & Sohne GmbH, Germany). The mass ratio of API:Methocel K100M:Avicel112:Mg S was 7.56:29.04: 25.72:14.52:1 for sample 1 and API:MethocelK100M:Ethocel:Avicel 112:Mg S = 7.56:14.52: 14.52:29.04:1 for sample 2, respectively.Kollidon K90 (5% sol. in alcohol 99%) was used as gran-ulation fluid. The wet mass was passed through #6 mesh and granules were oven dried until a moisture content of 1-3% was achieved. Dried granules were further passed through #230 mesh. The granules were lubricated and compressed into round shaped (7.0 mm) tablets using 4-station rotary compres-sion machine (Korsch XL 100, Korsch AG, Germany) with compression forces 3.8 kN and 8.3 kN (sample 1a,1b and 2, accordingly). Each tablet contained 15 mg of API in 150 mg tablet core weight. The tablets were evaluated for appearance, diameter, thickness and hardness. Characterization of the final blends Bulk density was determined by the following formula: Bulk density =Ws/Vs; where Ws is sample weight and Vs is the sample volume (Ph. Eur. 8.7).Tape density is the indirect measurement of flow, mixing and tableting properties of powder. Tapped density was deter-mined by Ph. Eur. 8.7 method: tablet blend was filled in 100 ml graduated cylinder of tap density tester which was operated for fixed number of taps until the powder bed volume has reached S4 PP 192406Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 405 - 406 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsa minimum, thus was calculated by formula: Tapped density = Weight of mixture/volume of mixture after 100 tapings.Compressibility index of the final blends was determined by Carr's compressibility (%) = Df - Do/Df; where Df is the bulk density and Do is the tapped density (Ph. Eur. 8.7).Hausner's ratio or index of flowability was calculated by the formula: Hausner's ratio=V1/V2; where V1 is the volume before taping and V2 is the volume after taping (Ph. Eur. 8.7).Angle of repose was determined using funnel method. Tablet blend were poured from funnel, that can be raised ver-tically until a maximum cone height h was obtained diameter heap D, was measured (Ph. Eur. 8.7). The angle of repose was measured using Granulate flow tester (Erweka GmbH, Ger-many).Loss on drying is the loss of mass expressed as per cent m/m (Ph. Eur. 8.7). It was measured by drying the substance to constant mass using Moisture Analyzer (Mettler Toledo Ex-cellence HS 153, US). Physical characterization of the prepared tablets10 tablets were used to study the weight variation us-ing electronic balance (Sartorius Secura 224-1CU, Sartorius AG,Germany). The diameter, thickness and tablet hardness was deter-mined for ten tablets using ErwekaTablet Hardness Tester Type TBH 425 TD (Erweka GmbH, Germany).In vitro drug release studiesDissolution testing was conducted in 900 ml of phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (USP apparatus I, basket, speed 100 rpm) at 37+-0.5 degC. A 5 ml of the dissolution medium was withdrawn at regular tome intervals (after 2, 4, 10 and 12 h). The vol-ume of dissolution medium was adjusted by replacing each 5 ml aliquot withdrawn with 5 ml of fresh dissolution medium. Quantity of released API was determined by previously vali-dated HPLC method.Results and discussionThe bulk density of sample 1 and sample 2 were 0.272 and 0.360 g/ml respectively, while tapped density values were 0.331 and 0.439 g/ml. Compressibility index of sample 1 and sample 2 were 18 and 19%, while Hausner's ratio values were 1.22 and 1.21 correspondingly, which is an indication of fair flow properties. Angle of repose of the final blends was 41.2deg for sample 1 and 40.3deg for sample 2. LOD was found to be 2.40% for sam-ple1 and 2.55% for sample2 indicating that both of the final blends had moisture content up to acceptable limit which was good for compression to make uniform matrices. All tablets were smooth and elegant in appearance. Tablet weight variations for both samples prepared in this study were found to be less than 1%. Sample 1a had diameter of 7.00 mm; thickness 4.23 mm and hardness 5.01 kP (at compression force 3.8 kN). Sample 1b had diameter of 6.97 mm; thick-ness 3.37 mm and hardness 14.29 kP (at compression force 8.2 kN). Sample 2 had diameter of 6.97 mm; thickness 3.32 mm and hardness 12.12 kP (at compression force 8.2 kN).Polymers belonging to hydrophilic matrix systems, when exposed to an aqueous medium, do not disintegrate, but im-mediately after hydration form a highly viscous gelatinous surface barrier which control the liquid penetration into the center of the matrix system as well as drug release from the dosage form (Talukder et al., 1996). Sample 1a released 57.63, 71.96 and 100.78% after 2, 4 and 10 h, respectively. In the same investigated period, sample 1b released 50.44, 69.88 and 100.55%, indicating that there is no significant difference in the drug release from the Methocel matrices compresses at different compression forces. It can be implied that the porosity and/or tortuosity of the prepared tab-lets after their hydration were not affected by an increase in tablet hardness from 3.8 kN and 8.2 kN. Obtained results in this work were in accordance with the literature data (Ravi et al., 2008).Sample 2 released the 30.75, 50.78, 77.49 and 89.13% after 2, 4, 10 and 12 h, indicating that the fine Ethocel parti-cles contributed to retard the drug release from the matrices. The reduction in release rates with addition of Ethocel was perhaps due to slow hydration of the matrix, based upon the hydrophobic character of Ethocel. The insoluble particles of Ethocel were probably acting as barrier to drug release in the gel layer of Methocel.ConclusionBased on these results it can be concluded that the com-bination of Methocel and Ethocel could be a successful solu-tion in modifying the release of water-soluble drug form ma-trix system tablets.

Beograd, Prahovska 3, 11000 Beograd, Republic of Serbia* vdinic@alkaloid.co.rsIntroductionStatistical process control (SPC) provides a statistical approach for evaluating the process of production and for improving the quality of the process through better under-standing. SPC is a process orientated data driven method to improve processes to deliver day after day results that have added value for the customer. In particular this meth-od will help tocontinuously improve processes and reduce variability, describe and control the stability of process-es, monitor and prove excellence of processes, alert before any batch is violating specifications, and document process understanding for regulatory agencies (Sven, 2016).When SPC is effectively implemented within a com-pany, benefits can be derived through a reduced cost of manufacture, improved quality, fewer troubleshooting cri-ses, and improved relationships with customers (Thomas et al., 2006).In this paper the application of SPC in the process of packaging of tablets in the pharmaceutical industry is shown. As a key process indicator (KPI) for the process of packaging the yield of the final product is observed. As a critical quality attribute an assay of tablets in the final prod-uct is observed. For SPC studies, individual values - Con-trol Charts and Moving Ranges-control charts were con-structed and Process capability indexes were calculated in order to verify if the process is under control.Materials and methodsMaterials used were as follows: Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg (Alkaloid A.D., Skopje, Macedonia), PVC foil 250 mm x 118 mm (Lamp East d.o.o., Serbia), alu-minum foil Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg (Lamp East d.o.o., Serbia), leaflet Amlodipin tablets 5 mg and 10 mg (Zapisd.o.o., Serbia), Carton boxes Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x30 (Grafolikd.o.o., Serbia). Equipment used was: blister packaging machine IMA TR100LT (IMA S.p.a. Italy), data printing line Videojet 1210 + Etipack Clear (Videojet Technologies Itc, USA, Etipack, S.p.a., Italy), HPLC Thermo Scientific DIONEX UltiMate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) STA-TISTICA 8, StatSoft Inc., USA. Data for the yield of the blister packaging process were obtained as a ratio of produced number of packages of final product Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x 30 and planned number of packages of each batch, expressed as a percentage.The content of amlodipine in Amlodipin Alkaloid tab-lets 5 mg was analyzed according to the Ph. EUR. 8 mono-graph for Amlodipine besylate with HPLC method (EP 2.2.29).Control charts were generated by STATISTICA soft-ware, after the following steps were performed:- The data for yield and content of Amlodipine were obtained for all batches of Amlodipin Al-kaloid tablets 5 mg x30 that were manufactured in 2015;- The overall mean and average were calculated;- Moving ranges were calculated;- Process standard deviations for the process and moving ranges were calculated;- Control limits for individual values (UCL and LCL) and moving ranges (UCLMR) were cal-culated (Bakker et al., 2008).Process capability indexes can be used as a tool that will show how often the process fits into the specification limits. There are two most common used process capabili-ty indexes: Cp and Cpk.S4 PP 193408Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 407 - 408 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationsThe Cp-value is the relation of the range of the specifi-cation to the range of the process and it doesn't show if the process is within the specification limits. The Cpk-value is the relation of the range of the spec-ification to the mean value to the range of the process. If the value is below 1.0 there are values outside specifica-tion. If the value is exactly 0 half of the values are outside specification. All process should have Cpk>1.33 to be sure that the process is stable and always in the desired specifi-cation limits.For the purpose of the study Cpk indexes for the yield of the packaging process and for the content of amlodipine in the finished product Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x 30 were calculated.Results and discussionThe new approach of the pharmaceutical industry was developed after the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) announced initiative in August 2002, Pharmaceutical Cur-rent Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) for the 21st Century. The modern approach of the pharmaceutical in-dustry has a basis in good process and product understand-ing. Quality should be built in each phase of the product lifecycle.As a result of this approach the use of different tools that will help to gain better knowledge for the process is in-creased in the last 15 years. These tools can be used in all stages of the lifecycle of the drug product. During the man-ufacturing of the drug products the most common tools that might help in the understanding of the process are: quali-ty risk management, corrective and preventive action, pro-cess capability studies, Six Sigma and control charts.Individual values control charts and moving ranges control charts should be always evaluated together in order to have a complete picture of the process. After the con-trol charts were generated it was concluded that all of the Western Electric statistical rules were satisfied (Bonnie et al., 1956): 1. One point outside of the control limits (3 s);2. Two points out of 3 are more than 2 s from the cen-tre line;3. Four points out of 5 are more than 1 s from the cen-tre line;4. Eight points on one side of the center linefor both control charts: yield and assay of amlodipine in the finished product Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x 30. It was shown on data obtained from 83 produced batch-es during 2015, that the process of packaging of Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 30 x 5 mg is under statistical control and there is no special cause variability. Also the Cpk indexes values showed that the process is always capable to give high yield and the active substance content is always with-in specified limits.The values for the yield and assay of amlodipine in the finished product Amlodipin Alkaloid tablets 5 mg x 30, ob-tained from the last 30 batches were used to calculate the control limits for continual process verification. The pack-aging process of all batches that have been produced from 01.2016 onwards will be followed by control charts with the new established control limits.ConclusionIn the pharmaceutical industry SPC can be used for better understanding of the process, to analyze existing re-sults for Annual Product Review and as a tool for continu-ous process verification. Different kind of data can be an-alyzed as per example: in-process control data (tablet's weight, tablet's height), quality control data (dissolution, content of active substance, and content of impurities) and process performance data (yield).
