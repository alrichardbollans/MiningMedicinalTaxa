Out of the 9 resultant MMT only one (brain glycogen phosphorylase) was preferentially targeted by sweet phytocompounds, while all the rest (epidermal growth factor receptor erbB1, matrix metalloproteinase 3, acetylcholinesterase, cytochrome P450 19A1, androgen receptor, cyclooxygenase-2, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, matrix metalloproteinase 9) were preferentially targeted by bitter phytocompounds. There is no information linking brain glycogen phosphorylase (the ,,sweet target") to a putative AIA, while all the ,,bitter targets" are more or less involved in AIA. Bitter phytocompounds (by comparison with sweet ones) have a higher probability of targeting molecules involved in anti-inflammatory pathways. [1] Dragos D, Gilca M.

Bioassay-guided isolation of ethanolic extract of rhizomes of S. thorelii has yielded two new phenolic compounds, thorechalcone 1 and thorelignan 2, along with eight known analogs (3- 10). All the compounds were assayed for cytotoxicity on four human tumor cell lines (A549, MCF-7, WiDr, and HepG2); thorechalcone 1, showed the most anti-proliferative effect on HepG2 cells and was further evaluated its effect on cell cycle progression at 12.5 uM. Besides the structures of 1 and 3 were elucidated by IR, UV, and X-ray analyses, all the isolates were identified their structures by NMR and MS data. Moreover, the quantification of two major compounds 4 and 5 by using HPLC-DAD was also validated. This study presented the isolations of antiproliferative potentials of new chalcone and known flavonoid derivatives from S. thorelii. The validated simple, accurate, and rapid HPLC method could be deployed for the quality control of herbal drugs.1OOMeOH OHHO OMeOMe 2OOOOOHwww.ethnopharmacology2021.org24820th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSPharmacological and clinical studies of medicinal plants & natural productsP136. Code of taste in traditional Chinese medicine - a genetic key?CT. Gradinaru, M. GilcaDepartment of Functional Sciences I- Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, RomaniaIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the taste of herbs is classified into five flavors, which are related to certain ethnopharmacological activities and target organs (sweet- Spleen/Pancreas, pungent- Lungs, salty- Kidney, sour- Liver, bitter- Heart). The ancient concept of taste-based selection of herbs was suggested to have a biological basis in the widespread extraoral distribution of taste receptors (TASR) and chemosensors (CHEMS) [1,2].The aim of the present work was to check whether the TCM theory of flavors might have a correspondent in the tissue specific TASR gene expression levels and phenotypes.A systematic search with bioinformatic tools [3-6] using the name of TASR and CHEMS genes as keywords, was performed.The most striking finding was that among all the organs, the highest expression of TAS1R3 gene was reported in spleen (TAS1R3 is constituent of both sweet and umami TASR). Not unexpected, the highest expression of SCNN1A and SCNN1G (salty TASRs) was reported in the kidneys. Concerning the 25 bitter TASRs, only TAS2R19 and TAS2R38 expression was highest in the heart among the 5 TCM organs, but certain phenotypes (e.g. TAS2R16) were associated with cardiopathies. Only indirect data (e.g. phenotypes, eQTLs) supports the traditional association of pungency with lungs. No genetic evidence supports the association sour- liver.In conclusion, at least some of the TCM taste-organ associations are supported by modern genome data. Further experimental studies are required to explore the potential biotechnological applications of these ethnopharmacological concepts. [1] M. Behrens et al, Chem. Biol.

Gallic acid inhibits melanogenesis by activating the autophagy system in B16F10 cells.W.L. Chang1, Y.C. Hseu1, H.L. Yang21 Department of Cosmeceutics, China Medical University, Taiwan 2 Department of Nutriton, China Medical University, TaiwanGallic acid (GA) is a natural phenol compound that is commonly found in green plants and fruits. It has been shown to have a variety of biological properties, including anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and other activities. GA has been reported to inhibit melanin production via down-regulation of MITF and its downstream signaling pathway. In this study, we intended to delve into the molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-melanogenic activity of GA in induction of autophagy in melanoma B16F10 cells. We found that GA-induced autophagy was evidenced via increased LC3-II accumulation and acidic vesicular organelle (AVO) formation in B16F10 cells. These events are associated with decreased p62 and ATG4B, and dysregulated Beclin-1/Bcl-2 ratio. Further, GA was found to suppress the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade, activating autophagy in B16F10 cells. Notably, pretreatment of cells with the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA diminished GA-mediated anti-melanogenic activity. Gallic acid is expected to become a significant skin-whitening agent in cosmetic applications in the future. [1] Chuang, C.Y. ; Liu, H.C.; Wu, L.C. ; Chen, C.Y. ; Chang, J.T. ; Hsu, S.L.

Bioassay-guided isolation of methanolic extract of stems of E. neriifolia using open columns, and RP-HPLC resulted in the isolation has yielded three ellagic acid derivatives, 3,3',4-tri-O-methyl-4'-O-rutinosyl ellagic acid (1), 3,3'-di-O-methylellagic acid (2) and 3.3'.4'-tri-O-methylellagic acid (3), along with another six known compounds as (6S,9S)-roseoside (4), 6,7,8 trimethoxy coumarin (5), 7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-2H-chromen-2-one (6), Scopoletin (7), Kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside (8), Indole carboxylic acid (9). All the compounds were evaluated by their inhibition of NO production in LPS-induced RAW264.7 macrophages and assayed for cytotoxicity on human tumor cell lines A549 and MCF-7; in there, three ellagic acid derivatives showed the anti-proliferative effect on A549 and MCF-7 cells. Base on the structures of compounds 1 to 3, we also found 3.3'.4'-Tri-O-methylellagic acid with the most anticancer effect. Notably, compound 3 demonstrated potent anti-NO activity (IC50 = 17.41 +- 0.73 mM) and cytotoxicity against A549 and MCF-7 with the EC50 value of about 58.14 mM with dose-dependent and led to apoptosis.OOOOOCH3OCH3OOOCH3OHOHHOOOCH3HOHOOHOOOOOCH3OHHOOCH3OOOOOCH3OCH3H3COOH1 2 3[1] Mali PY, Panchal SS.

Ethnopharmacological perspective on Pulicaria species (Compositae).B. Gurdal1, E. Ozdemir-Nath21 Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, Istanbul University, Turkey2 Department of Pharmaceutical Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, Altinbas University, TurkeyThe genus Pulicaria Gaertn. is represented about 127 species in the world. The main distribution areas are from Europe to North Africa and Asia, particularly around the Mediterranean. Pulicaria species are traditionally used in folk medicine. For instance, species are used for bronchitis, cold, inflamed wound in Turkey, as cicatrizant, antiinflammatory and for muscular- skeletal diseases, skin diseases in Spain, for diabetes, ankle sprain, headache, flatulent colic in Yemen, for abdominal pain in Mauritania. Besides that, some species are used in folk veterinary in Italy as antiparasitics, repellents and for respiratory ailments.Different types of chemical compounds have been reported on the genus Pulicaria, such as phenolic derivatives, monoterpene derivatives, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, flavonoids, triterpenes, steroids, essential oils, and others. Besides that flavonoids and sesquiterpenoids are the dominant compounds. A few studies refer to the composition of the essential oils of Pulicaria species. For examples, major compounds of essential oil of Pulicaria taxa in Turkey are found as cyclohexenylpiperidine, 7-methoxy-6-ethoxy-2,2dimethlchromanone, epibicyclosesquiphallandrene, 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene,2,3,4,5,7,7-hexamethyl and 1,3-cyclopentadiene,1,2,5,5 tetramethyl. On the other study, 2-isopropyl-4-methylphenol and isobutyric acid 2-isopropyl-4-methylphenylester are isolated from the essential oil of P. odora.There are many biological activity studies on the genus Pulicaria in the literature. Different extracts of P. dysenterica are shown to be active against Vibrio chlorea. The antimicrobial activity of Pulicaria species has been studied against different microorganisms. Antiinflammatory activity of Pulicaria wightiana which is used as traditional folk medicine in India has been studied and found efficacy for treatment of inflammation.In this presentation, recent studies on biological activity and traditional uses of Pulicaria species are evaluated.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org25420th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSTraditional use of plants and herbal pharmacopoeias the contribution of the Mediterranean floraP140. An ethnobotanical study on the traditional uses of medicinal and aromatic plants in the mountainous area of Troodos in Cyprus.A. Savvides, C. Stavridou, S. Ioannidou, G. Adamides, D. Fasoula, A. StylianouAgricultural Research Institute, Nicosia, CyprusTroodos mountain range can be considered as a cradle of biodiversity for the island of Cyprus and local people as the guards of an important portion of the island's cultural heritage. Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) are a distinctive component of the Mediterranean vegetation and their traditional uses a valuable cultural element that should be safeguarded and promoted. The aim of this ethnobotanical study was to collect and document information about MAPs traditionally used in Troodos and identify the most popular and important taxa. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2019-2020 and exponential discriminative snowball sampling was employed for candidate respondents' detection and selection. The knowledge on the traditional plant uses obtained through interviews was classified in general and medicinal use categories, whilst the most popular and important taxa were identified using well-known ethnobotanical indices.
