The cost of the thera-peutic monitoring procedures has been a continuous con-cern of the TDM service worldwide. Several studies have shown the benefits both in terms of therapeutic benefit for the patient and of economic benefit due to the implementa-tion of the therapeutic drug monitoring for different drugs. By the other hand there are other groups of drugs which do not need to undergo continuous therapeutic drug monitor-ing (Eadie, 1995). The therapeutic drug monitoring is applied in Albania through the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory within the University Hospital, since there is not yet in place e specif-ic service dealing with therapeutic monitoring of drugs. A future challenge for the therapeutic drug monitoring in Al-bania represents the inclusion of the clinical pharmacists in this process. It has been demonstrated through several studies that the pharmacists can play a critical role as part of the multidisciplinary team driving the TDM process as they have the skills and knowledge to resolve drug therapy problems (Ratanajamit et al., 2009; Steinman et al., 2011). The combination of different health professionals involved in the therapeutic drug monitoring process, together with the recent technology developments, facilitates new appli-cations in this field (Eliason, 2013).ConclusionThe service of therapeutic drug monitoring can pro-vide important information about the appropriateness of the clinical prescriptions and can therefore influence the outcomes of the drug therapy. The continuous evaluation of the medical interventions through the therapeutic drug monitoring interventions can improve the drug therapy re-sulting in better outcomes for the patient and in cost con-tainment. The involvement of the clinical pharmacist in the multidisciplinary team can improve the performance of the therapeutic drug monitoring service.ReferencesBurton, M.E., Shaw, L.M., Schentag, J.J., Evans, W.E., 2006.

However, despite its clinical efficacy, great variability in clinical response ex-ists. Much attention is paid to the genetic factors affecting inter-individual differences in clinical response and sever-al studies in this area point to single nucleotide polymor-phisms (SNPs) in the gene SLCO1B1 encoding multiple organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). As a membrane influx transporter, OATP1B1 regulates the cellular/hepatic uptake of a number of endogenous com-pounds and drugs, incl. atorvastatin (Giannakopoulou et al., 2014; Rodrigues et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011). Hence, SLCO1B1 SNPs are attractive targets for analyzing their influence on statin differential response (Giannakopoulou et al., 2014). SNPs 521T>C (*5, rs4149056) and 388A>G (*1b, rs2306283) that encode alanine substitution of valine at amino acid 174 (p.Val174Ala) and amino acid change at position 130 (p.Asn130Asp), respectively, are considered as the most prevalent SLCO1B1 variants relevant for the variability of drug response. c.388A>G variant has been associated with increased OATP1B1 transport activity of several substrate drugs in vitro (He et al., 2011), unlike c.521T>C variant for which reduced transport activity in vitro and increased plasma concentrations of several sub-strate drugs in the human body were observed (Kalliokos-ki et al., 2010). The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of SLCO1B1 c.521T>C and c.388A>G variants on the lipid lowering effect of atorvastatin in a sample of Albanian population.Materials and methodsSubjects and study design Briefly, 64 adults (53% males, av. age 58 yrs. and BMI 28) with primary hypercholesterolemia, all of Albanian or-igin participated in the study. All the participants used ator-vastatin once daily in a dose range of 10-80 mg. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Note for Guidance on GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95). The final clinical trial proto-col as well as the informed consent and other information that required pre-approval were reviewed and approved by the Independent Ethics Committee according to the appli-cable regulations.MethodsThe genotyping of SLCO1B1 521T>C and 388A>G was performed at the UKIM-Center for biomolecular phar-maceutical analyses, using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay (TaqMan(r) Drug Metabolizing Assay; Applied Bio-systems, Foster City, California, USA). Polymerase chain S6 PP 272570Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 569 - 570 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsreaction was performed on the Real-Time PCR system Mx3005P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) using TaqMan genotyping protocols (TaqMan(r)Drug Metabolizing assay; Applied Biosystems Foster City, Ca, USA) in total volume of 12.5 mL under the following conditions: one cycle of 2 min at 50 oC, one cycle of 10 min at 95 oC, and 50 cycles of 15 sec at 92 oC and 1 min at 60 oC. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apo-lipoprotein A (ApoA) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) were measured at beginning and after 3 months of treatment by standard accredited methods. All data were statistically an-alyzed using different statistical methods (independent t-test, Mann-Whitney and Kruskall-Wallis tests and Bonfer-roni correction, with 95%CI, IBM SPSS 19.0). Chi-square test was used to deduce deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The results were considered statistically sig-nificant at p<0.05.Results and discussionThe frequencies of the SLCO1B1 521T>C and 388A>G variant alleles were found to be 11% and 41%, respectively. However, no carrier of c.521CC was identi-fied. These frequencies were found to be similar to those observed in Macedonians (14.1% and 40%) (Daka et al., 2015) and Caucasians (15% and 37%) (Mwinyi et al., 2004). The observed frequency distributions did not show significant deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibri-um. Three-month treatment with atorvastatin significantly decreased the plasma levels of TC, LDL-C, TG and ApoB and increased the average values of HDL-C and ApoAI to the referent values. However, no statistically significant change in the levels of Lp(a) was observed and this pa-rameter remained out of referent range (>=30 mg/dL; per-cent change -8.23+-15.16%). In the carriers of c.521TC (n=14), higher decrease in the levels of TC, TG and Lp(a) (11%, 15% and 26%, accordingly) was observed in com-parison with the c.521TT carriers (n=50), pointing to low-er activity of OATP1B1 in the carriers of variant c.521-allel. This could be confirmed by the percent changes in the levels of HDL-C and ApoAI in different c.521 geno-types of this ethnic group. Namely, after 3-month treat-ment, the average percent change of HDL-C was lower in c.521TC carriers (7.46+-9.66%) vs. higher average percent change of 15.96+-93.68% in c.521TT carrier (53% low-er increase). Similarly, the highest increase in the average percent change of ApoAI was observed in the carriers of c.521TT, 12.13+-12.27% vs. 4.32+-17.09% in the carriers of c.521TC (181% higher increase). No effect on the mean percentage changes of all these parameters after 3-month treatment with atorvastatin was observed among carriers of different SLCO1B1 c388A>G genotypes. These results are consistent with the findings from several studies con-ducted in the European (Giannakopoulou et al. 2014), Bra-zilian (Rodrigues et al., 2010) and Chinese population (Fu et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2010), where atorvastatin, simvas-tatin and pitavastatin as drugs were administered.ConclusionNo significant association between different SL-CO1B1 c.388A> G genotypes and atorvastatin response was observed in the studied Albanian population. Visible differences were observed between c.521TC and c.521TT carries, suggesting association between the c.521T>C SNP and atorvastatin response. Additional studies, with a large sample size, are needed to confirm statistical significance of this finding.ReferencesDaka Grapci, A., Dimovski, J.A., Kapedanovska, A., Vavlukis, M., Eftimov, A., Matevska Geshkovska, N., Labachevski, N., Jakjovski, H., Gorani., D., Kedev, S., Mladenovska, K., 2015.

GSTs are found in almost all organisms from mammals to plants and even in some prokaryotes. Human GSTs consist of three families: cytosolic GSTs, mitochon-drial GSTs, and microsomal GSTs.
