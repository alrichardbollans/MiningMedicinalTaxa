A binucleated cell with a nucleoplasmic bridge may or may not contain one or more micronuclei and on rare occasions more than one nucleoplasmic bridge may be observed within one binucleated cell. (A) (B) (C) (D)Fig. 3.5. Displays different binucleated cells that can be scored for micronuclei in the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. (A) is the ideal binucleated cell to be scored while (B) has a touching daughter nuclei. Nucleoplasmic bridges between the two daughter nuclei, as shown in (C) and (D), with (D) possessing a relativelywider bridge. (Adopted from Fenech et al., 2003).Copy I 120Y. SharifuddinChapter 3Fig. 3.6. Four examples where micronuclei presence in binucleated cells that are suitable for scoring. The relative sizes o f the micronuclei is also shown. In (A), the cell contains two micronuclei with different sizes whereas in (B) the micronuclei touched but did not overlapped with the main nuclei. Nucleoplasmic bridge is observed in (C) andmultiple micronuclei is shown in (D), a rare occurrence in cells. (Adopted from Fenech et al., 2003).The guidelines followed for scoring necrotic and apoptotic cells were as recommended byFenech et til. (2003).Necrotic cells:1. Early necrotic cells can be identified by the presence of a pale cytoplasm with numerous vacuoles (mainly in the cytoplasm and some in the nucleus) and damaged cytoplasmic membrane with a fairly intact nucleus.2. Late necrotic cells exhibit loss of cytoplasm and irregular/damaged nuclear membrane with only a partially intact nuclear structure and often with nuclear material leaking from the nuclear boundary.3. Staining intensity of the nucleus and cytoplasm is usually less than that observed in viable cells.Apoptotic cells:1. Early apoptotic cells can be identified by the presence of chromatin condensation within the nucleus and intact cytoplasmic and nuclear boundaries.2. Late apoptotic cells exhibit nuclear fragmentation into smaller nuclear bodies within an intact cytoplasm/cytoplasmic membrane.3. Staining intensity in the nucleus, nuclear fragments and cytoplasm is usually greater than in viable cells.Copy I 121Y. SharifuddinChapter 3apoptotic cells necrotic cells Fig. 3.7. Shows different stages o f apoptotic and necrotic cell death. The mono- and binucleated cells shown experienced an early stage o f apoptotic response where chromatin condensation occurred without disintegration of the plasma membrane, whereas the third example shows cells in late apoptosis with apoptotic bodies in the absence o f nuclear membrane. In comparison, cells suffering from necrotic cell death show the presence of vacuoles, cytoplasmic loss and damage to the cell membrane. The first two examples are mononucleated cells in the early stage of necrosis and the third example is necrotic cell in late stage evident from the absence of cytoplasm and damaged nuclear membrane (Adopted from Fenech et al., 2003).3.5.12 Replication Index Calculation.Apart from utilising the frequency of necrotic and apoptotic cells as biomarkers for cytotoxicity, assessment of toxicity was performed by determining cell proliferation in both treated and control cultures using the replication index (RI) values which denotes the relative number of nuclei in cell cultures exposed to test agent compared to negative control cultures as described by Kirsch-Volders et al. (2004):^ (Number o f binucleates + 2 x number o f multinucleates)T / Total number o f cellsT ^^(Number o f binucleates + 2 x number o f multinucleates\ / Total number o f cellsc ( 1)where T: test agent treatment culture; and C: solvent control culture.Therefore, the measurement of reduction in treated cultures due to the presence of test agent; Cytotoxicity = 100 -- RI. .....(2)Copy I 122Y. SharifuddinChapter 33.5.13 Trypan Blue Exclusion Assay for Cell Viability.AHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79 cells were grown in 25cm culture flasks as described previously in Section 3.5.5; 3.5.6 and treated with various doses of andrographolide as mentioned in Section 3.5.8 respectively. After 24 hours, the cells were treated with various doses of andrographolide; gassed with 5% CO2 and incubated for another 37+-1degC for 24 hours. Subsequently and as described by the manufacturer, 0.5ml of 0.4% Trypan Blue solution was transferred into centrifuge tubes containing 0.3ml HBSS. Cells that were floating and attached to the flask surface were collected; washed by centrifugation at 1500rpm for 5 minutes and re-suspended in HBSS in correspondingly labelled tubes. Then, 0.2ml of cell | suspensions in HBSS that were prepared earlier, were transferred into each of those| centrifuge tubes and mixed thoroughly (5 dilution factor). The cell number were countediI using Neubauer haemocytometer; the ratios of viable and non-viable cells (blue-stained) in I treated and untreated cells were determined.Cell growth to determine any changes in cell counts was calculated as;1i,, ,, , (Cell number in treated cultures)Cell growth = \ x 100(Cell number in untreated cultures)| 3.5.14 Kinetochore labelling.1| The indirect immunofluorescent labelling of kinetochore proteins was performed as| described by Ellard et al. (1991) with some minor modifications. The prepared slides wereremoved from storage and were rehydrated in PBS at room temperature for one minute. The slides were then dipped in a primulin solution (0.005pg/ml) for 10 seconds in order to stain the cytoplasm. This was subsequently followed by washing and rewashing the slides in PBS and any excess PBS was removed.CREST antibody was diluted in PBS with a 1:1 ratio and 50pl of the diluted antibody were applied onto the cytodots of each slide. Plastic cover slips were applied and the slides were incubated in humidified chambers at 37degC for 45 minutes.Copy 1 123Y. SharifuddinChapter 3After the incubation, the cover slips removed; slides were washed three times for 3 minutes in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) followed by washes in PBS for 3 minutes. The slides were left in PBS to prevent drying out while a second antibody was prepared. A second antibody, FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG with PBS in 1:100 ratio and 50pl of the diluted antibody were applied onto the cytodots of each slide. Cover slips were added and the slides were incubated for 45 minutes in humidified chambers. Again, the slides were washed twice with PBS+1% BSA followed by a final wash with water to remove salt. The slides were then left to air-dry in the dark and kept at 20degC until needed.To visualise the signals, 20pl DAPI/Antifade (lpl + 9jnl water + 990pl vectashield) solution were added and the slides viewed using Olympus BH-F Fluorescence microscope. The DAPI and fluorochrome signals of the kinetochore can be visualised through the triple band filter.3.5.15 Statistical Analyses.The t-test was employed to assess whether the means of two groups examined were statistically different from each other and the 95% (p<0.05) confidence limits were adopted. Dunnett's test is a multiple comparison post-hoc test performed after an ANOVA or t-test, which compares all treatment data against the control. A sample size formula was included guaranteeing the possibility of correctly detecting each treatment with mean value. Again, a 95% level of confidence was applied (p<0.05 significance) to reject the null hypothesis. The SPSS(r) statistical analysis software was employed in performing the analyses.Figure 3.8 shows a flow chart that briefly summarised the materials and methods employed.Copy 1 124Y. SharifuddinChapter 3Fig. 3.8 The flow chart for materials and methods employed in CBMA.CELLS CULTUREDAHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79 cells were cultured at 37"C in their respective growth media and gassed with 5% CO2 inair.ANDROGRAPHOLIDE TREATMENTThe cultured cells were treated with andrographolide. doses ranging from lOpM to 90pM (the highest dose).Subsequently. 40pl cytochalasin-B were added to the andrographolide-treated cells and incubated at 37degC for 24 hours.Positive controls were prepared by treating the cultured cells with 50ng mitomycin-C in separate culture flasks and then incubated at 37degC for 24 hours.CELL HARVESTINGAfter 24 hours incubation period, the treated cells were harvested and prepared on microscope slides with replicates.STAINING AND SCORING PROCEDURESThe slides were stained with 20% Giemsa solution and acridine orange.The stained slides were coded and blindly scored at lOOOx magnification under oil immersion according to Fenech etal. (2003).Slides of MCL-5 cells were also subjected to kinetochore labelling with CREST antibodies.Copy I 125Y. SharifuddinChapter 33.6 RESULTSThe dose-setting experiment for in vitro CBMA was conducted on AHH-1 cells treated with andrographolide and the results tabulated in Table 3.2. Andrographolide induced micronuclei and cytotoxicity at the concentrations as indicated in Table 3.2. In further experiments, the number of andrographolide doses used was reduced from 10 to 5 since no significant difference was observed between the 10 doses adopted initially. Subsequently, the same dose-range selected for AHH-1 was used in treating V-79 and MCL-5 cell lines respectively.Table 3.2.

The results obtained are tabulated and the raw data are available in the Appendix. As shown in Tables 3.3, 3.4 and3.5 respectively, the mean percentage of binucleated cells decreased with increasing dose of andrographolide in all three cell lines tested. Figure 3.12 shows an example of a binucleated AHH-1 cell harbouring two micronuclei stained with acridine orange. The frequency of micronuclei in binucleated cells exhibit the same pattern in all three cell lines where the values accrued steadily with dose before beginning to decrease at 70 and 90pM doses respectively. As shown in Tables 3.3 and 3.5, andrographolide was capable of inducing micronuclei in binucleated cells with statistically significant difference to the negative control between the doses of 10 and 50pM in AHH-1 and V-79 cells respectively. InCopy 1 126Y. SharifuddinChapter 3comparison, 30 to 50pM of the same phytochemical were required to cause the same effect in MCL-5 cells. For both V-79 and AHH-1, 30pM of the compound caused the highest statistically significant induction of micronuclei in binucleated cells. As for MCL-5, which has five cytochrome CYP450 isoforms compared to AHH-1 cells, the highest statistically significant value (p<0.05) of micronuclei occurrence was observed at 5 0 jiM of andrographolide as tabulated in Table 3.4. Graphs in Figures 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 each illustrated the steady reduction of binucleated cells and the frequency of micronuclei induced by andrographolide in AHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79 cells during 24 hours treatment period.Table 3.3.
