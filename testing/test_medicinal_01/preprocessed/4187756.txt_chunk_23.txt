Whereas it was the botanists, ecologists and chemists who had been sent out to the Vietnamese countryside on ethno-scientific missions to liaise with traditional herbal practitioners in the past, in this collaboration, a traditional herbal practitioner has joined chemists in their laboratories, to assist them in their efforts to identify and characterise the chemical constituents that may be contributing to the therapeutic effects experienced by some of the by now 9,000 or so patients who have been treated with Heantos in Vietnam. To be sure, Dan's presence in the laboratory has been far from cosmetic, rather his detailed knowledge of the medicinal properties of each of the plants in 102 Nom is a script developed around the 10th century by using and modifying Chinese characters to write Vietnamese. 103 Because of an ongoing patent application process in Germany at the time of writing, I am not able to disclose the identity of the thirteen plants in question and I will therefore not be able to discuss the individual characteristics of these plants in the same way that I have with St. John's Wort. I will instead concentrate on the specific problems facing herbalists and chemists who work with standardisation of complex plant mixtures. 174 Heantos has been instrumental in the transformation of Heantos from its original syrup form into 'standardised' capsules. From the identification of the particular medicinal plant species to guidance on the best methods for extracting therapeutic constituents from these plants, Tran Khuong Dan has worked closely with Professor Tran Van Sung over the past decade as a partner in the laboratory. The Institute of Chemistry has in turn, for reasons which will become clear, enlisted their long time partners at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Biochemistry in Halle, Germany, to help with ongoing efforts to chemically characterise Heantos, with the ultimate aim of accounting for its therapeutic action. There have been a few key objectives in the further scientific development of Heantos since the mid 1990s. The first has been to transform Heantos into a stable, so-called 'multiple pot' herbal extract. That is to say, to take the first step towards standardisation by introducing reproducible extraction procedures, by building on Tran Khuong Dan's original, perhaps more crude, methods of extraction. This has been a complicated process which has, in turn, had a direct impact on ongoing clinical trials. In October 1997, the first results of the collaboration between Dan and the Institute of Chemistry came in the form of the first batch of Heantos dry extract capsules. To make things more practicable, Dan and Sung had agreed to divide the plants into three groups, each with a specific therapeutic function. Each of these three groups of plants was then processed into three individual dry extracts, which were subsequently manufactured into Heantos 1, Heantos 2 and Heantos 3 capsules. Importantly, this initial method of standardisation was based on therapeutic considerations as determined by Dan. Heantos 1 and 2 were to be used in the first three to seven days to treat withdrawal during detoxification, the former to appease withdrawal symptoms and to reinvigorate the health of the addicts, and the latter as a sedative to help patients sleep as much as possible (insomnia is a well known withdrawal symptom). Heantos 3 could then be used for a subsequent two to three months, specifically with the therapeutic aim of keeping any cravings at bay and thereby prevent relapse, especially in cases where detoxified addicts might become re-exposed to the environments in which they had grown accustomed to using drugs. Each of these three forms of Heantos were subsequently sent for pharmaceutical standards analysis at the Institute of Materia Medica, as well as for pharmacological and toxicological tests in mice and rabbits at the Institute of Drug Quality Control in April and September 1998 respectively (Vietnam. Institute of Chemistry. 1999). While Heantos 1 and 3 were 175 approved as living up to national safety and quality requirements, further toxicological tests were ordered by the scientific committee overseeing the re-evaluation of Heantos on the sedative Heantos 2 capsules, following concerns stemming from reports that it might be causing muscular spasms and convulsions in human patients. Although these further toxicological tests, which were completed in May 1999, suggested that Heantos 2 was far from lethal in the recommended dosages, the scientific committee decided to leave Heantos 2 out of clinical trials relating to the short-term efficacy of Heantos in treating withdrawal.104 This happened in spite of the central role given by Tran Khuong Dan to the sedative effects of Heantos 2 in the treatment of withdrawal. The second main objective of the Institute of Chemistry's efforts to further scientifically develop Heantos has been to phytochemically characterise each of the thirteen plants included in the original herbal syrup, in much the same way that St. John's Wort has been. And seeing as this task is a technology-intensive affair (some of which is not available in Vietnam), the Institute of Chemistry called upon their long time partners at one of Europe's most advanced plant biochemistry institutes in Halle to assist them in this effort. In the period May 2000 to March 2006, Vietnamese and German chemists joined forces to characterise the chemical constituents found in each of Heantos' thirteen plants. Starting with literature reviews in Chinese, Vietnamese, as well as international bibliographic databases to map out existing studies on the plants in question, the scientists employed chromatographic methods (thin layer, middle pressure liquid and high pressure liquid chromatography) to isolate pure compounds from Heantos components, and then infrared, ultraviolet, mass, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to structure-elucidate these compounds. The goal of these initial phytochemical efforts was "not to pursue the isolation of single bio-active principles and their synthesizing", but rather "to contribute to the optimisation of the efficacy of Heantos, to its development as a standardised product and to the scientific explanation of the effectiveness of a medication, which has its origin in traditional medicine" (Vietnam. Institute of Chemistry. 2001: 5-6). These efforts were given renewed importance in 2001, when the German government required that the analytical techniques used for confirming the declared contents of Heantos be developed as a precondition for the clinical trials with Heantos that were due to take 104 See Chapter 4 for a discussion of these trials. 176 place at the University of Essen. As a result, not only has the Institute of Plant Biochemistry assisted fellow Vietnamese chemists with their isolation and characterisation work, they have also embarked on an unprecedented effort to develop analytical techniques using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy that would allow for the identification of all thirteen plants in what had now become a single final Heantos extract. A further outcome of the initial phytochemical analyses of the Heantos components has been a rethinking of the strategy of extraction that had initially been developed at the Institute of Chemistry in Hanoi to produce Heantos 1, 2 and 3 capsules. On the basis of the initial literature reviews and chemical characterisations of the Heantos plants, Tran Khuong Dan and Tran Van Sung decided to re-group the plants for extraction, this time not in accordance with therapeutic aims, but rather according to the most prominent group of secondary metabolites found in each of the plants. In doing so, they argued that the amounts of extracted active ingredients could be enhanced as different types of constituents require different extraction methods to optimise yields. Using this new strategy of extraction, the thirteen plants105 were again divided into three groups that were then submitted to three different extraction methods, using particular solvents, temperatures and extraction times for each group. The resulting mixtures were then evaporated into three different pastes or powders, which were mixed together before a final evaporation was carried out, resulting in a final 'multiple pot' powder extract. This was subsequently manufactured into what are now known as Heantos 4 capsules. As a result, therapeutic concerns have become more a matter of adjusted Heantos 4 dosage regimens during the course of treatment than of using different Heantos capsules at different stages (Tran 2004). We will recall how complex it can be to develop 'fingerprint' control profiles which are faithful to the 'normal full spectrum' of constituents in a single plant like St. John's Wort. As put by Professor Ludger Wessjohann of the Institute of Plant Biochemistry, "analysing an extract which contains thirteen different plants is like being asked to identify an individual fingerprint from a single card which has had hundreds or even thousands of fingerprints messily jammed on top of each other" (Wessjohann 2005). A high pressure liquid chromatogram of a single-plant extract will often produce relatively sharp peaks indicating the presence of some of the more predominant metabolites in the plant, while a 105 Importantly, since the plants of Heantos are not at this stage cultivated, the chemists rely on Tran Khuong Dan's organoleptic evaluation of plant samples before carrying out standard analysis against existing control profiles. 177 similar chromatogram of a Heantos 4 extract gives a much smoother curve as all the different metabolite peaks 'hide' by blending and blurring into each other - an effect that a single bio-active compound approach seeks to avoid by breaking an extract down into the lowest possible chemical denominators and taking it from there. Nevertheless, as scientists in Germany and Vietnam have been committed to working towards a standardisation of the entire Heantos mixture, the Institute of Plant Biochemistry has had to enter uncharted territories in their efforts to develop analytical methods that would allow for the confirmation of the presence of all thirteen plants in a Heantos 4 extract in accordance with German national requirements. Since it was much too early in late 2005 to form any conclusions about what might be the most important therapeutically active constituents, not to mention contributing active ingredients in Heantos, the Institute of Plant Biochemistry has instead focused on searching for unique marker substances from each plant which could be reproducibly identified in the final Heantos 4 extract as a means to confirm their presence in the extract. Chemists at the Institute of Drug Quality Control in Hanoi had already successfully identified six out of the thirteen plants by comparing high pressure liquid chromatographs of Heantos 4 extracts against control profiles of the thirteen plants, but HPLC data was not sufficiently detailed for identifying the remaining seven. This task would require submitting Heantos 4 extract to the kind of technology-intensive structure elucidation spectroscopy that is usually reserved for single compounds. Although the resulting data might be described in terms of a lot of 'noise' resulting from the thousands of compounds in Heantos 4 extracts, it nevertheless became possible to search for particular patterns in the resulting hydrogen atom spectrums, which might then be used to confirm the presence of previously identified unique marker substances from each of the plants in question. Finally, the last key objective in the further scientific development of Heantos in both Vietnam and Germany over the past decade has been to prepare the ground for the bio-assay testing of the biological activity of the many compounds found in the Heantos 4 extract. For this assay testing, the Institute of Plant Biochemistry in Halle has enlisted a polymerase chain reaction-based gene expression profiling method trademarked by the German biotech company Biofrontera as "Digital Expression Pattern Display". This method has been specifically developed "for the purposes of elucidating pathology pathways of major brain diseases, of analysing the target profiles of drugs presently applied 178 or in development, and of identifying novel targets for drug action" (Maelicke and Lubbert 2002: 283). And as we will see in the following section, since addiction has increasingly come to be considered as a disease of the brain, such assays have become crucial for bio-scientific endeavours to identify 'plausible' mechanisms of action for the therapeutic effects experienced by patients treated with Heantos. Restorative herbal tonics and the regulation of neurotransmission A final key route for disciplining Vietnamese and British herbal medicine in recent decades has consisted of a search for pharmacologically plausible mechanisms of action. In the cases of Heantos and St. John's Wort this has entailed/entails a molecular mapping of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic pathways that individual chemical compounds follow as they are absorbed into and then disposed of by the body. It is this pharmacologic disciplining of herbal medicine that in particular is often characterised as a kind of scientific colonisation of herbal medicine which is gradually disrobing herbal medicine of its vitalist origins, especially when the language of meridians, energy flows and vital rhythms is discarded in favour of receptor regulation, neurotransmission and modulation. It is these differing 'languages of life' that are seen as incommensurable and consequently preventive of any kind of useful exchange between, for example, herbalists and pharmacologists. At its crudest, this incommensurability is seen as dividing a vitalism characteristic of TMCAM therapies from a mechanistic, rationalistic reductionism particular to modern medicine. Herbalists Michael McIntyre and Simon Mills suggest that "the approaches of traditional herbalism and modern medicine are in stark contrast", and that while there are "underlying, often unwritten assumptions of the ancient ways of medicine [common to] every healing tradition the world over, whether American Indian, early European, Islamic Middle Eastern, or rooted in the Ayurvedic medicine of the Indian sub-continent or the richness of the Chinese and Japanese systems,... they seem... not to apply to one system: that of modern technological medicine" (McIntyre 1988: 41; Mills 1993: 9). From the qi-energy106 of Chinese and Vietnamese medicine, the prana of Indian medicine, the animal magnetism 106 See Kaptchuk for a discussion about the distinction between an all-pervasive Qi which is "not so much a force added to lifeless matter but... [defines] everything in the universe, inorganic and organic" and a more specific, engendering and activating form of Qi which "permeates the entire person ... [and] is directly involved with a person's life", regulating and indeed allowing it (1983: 43-52). 179 of Mesmerism and the vis medicatrix naturae of western herbal medicine, the concept of a non-material 'life force' or elan vital has often been invoked to contrast what are characterised as vitalist as opposed to mechanist theories of life. What links this otherwise disparate range of life force conceptions, it is argued, is a shared idea of "an essential vital 'hum' that underpins all other living functions" (Mills 1993: 32). This 'hum' is considered essential for the possibility of life - its disruption causing illness, its discontinuation causing death. But there are also important differences in the ways in which this vital force has been conceptualised. For example, in Vietnamese traditional medicine, khi and huyet are described as "the two vital principles" with khi (of the Yang principle) seen as a "driving force" that ensures the circulation of huyet or blood (which is of the Yin principle). Equilibrium is preserved by their unobstructed movement "the breaking of which will lead to disorder", an "imbalance in vital energy" and therefore illness (Hoang, et al. 1999: 5-6). In British herbal medicine, vis medicatrix naturae (the body's own innate healing powers) has been described both in terms of a flowing "vital force" and a resonating "vital pulse", the disruption of which leads to illness. The distinction is important as while some ascribe to the concept of a life force, others distance themselves from its "recourse to the 'ghost in the machine'" preferring instead to conceptualise it as a vital pulse, a process of maintaining vital rhythms (McIntyre 1988; Mills 1993: 122). Notwithstanding these "subtle differences of interpretation", McIntyre goes as far as arguing that "regardless of training or tradition, the essential aim [of herbalists] is the same: to provide the patient with herbs that can re-establish or revive the harmonious flow of this universal life force, without which we die and which itself is the true healer" (1988: 42). And so, while Chinese, Vietnamese, Indian, early European and Islamic Middle Eastern traditions of medicines are described as inherently commensurable in such accounts, they are all, in turn, described as fundamentally incommensurable with one particular system: modern medicine.107 Yet there are two important ways in which contemporary herbal medicine in Vietnam and the United Kingdom has begun troubling this posited divide. Firstly, as already pointed out, it cannot be said that all herbalists ascribe to a single form of 107 Not of course by all. It is interesting to note that when asked about his collaboration with a practitioner of traditional herbal medicine, Professor Tran Van Sung of the Institute of Chemistry in Hanoi argues that "I do not see any contradiction between physics and metaphysics" (cited in Impact 2000). 180 vitalism, employing a single coherent set of concepts as they account for the modes of action of their remedies. There is plenty of scope for eclectic and diverging accounts not just between herbal and modern medicine practitioners, but just as importantly within herbal medicine and biomedicine as numerous differing accounts vie for plausibility. And secondly, recent efforts to scientifically standardise and further develop St. John's Wort and Heantos would certainly suggest that whatever incommensurabilities are at stake there seems to be plenty of room for cooperation, even if conclusions are not shared at the end of these collaborations. Tran Khuong Dan has provided a complex account of the mode of action of Heantos in terms of a therapeutic restoration of the balance of Yin-Yang and the five basic elements in an addict's body using relevant medicinal plants: "it is by rebalancing Yin and Yang in the body and not by suppressing individual withdrawal symptoms that these symptoms will disappear of their own" (Tran 1999). At the same time, he has also described how, while developing Heantos, he chose particular plants for his remedy with the specific aim of addressing a "chronic lack of drugs in the brain" by normalising the regulation of endorphins in a detoxified addict (ibid.). Similarly, herbalist Andrew Chevallier has characterised St. John's Wort as a 'nervine', "having a restorative and tonic or relaxant effect on the... battered nervous and endocrine systems of people suffering from nervous exhaustion, depression, nerve damage, long-term emotional stress, anxiety, and the like", while also suggesting that it "markedly increases, to a significant degree, serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine levels within the synapse, and seems to enhance the tranquilising activity of GABA and benzodiazepine - all of which are involved... in the onset or maintenance of depression" (1999: 91, 47).
