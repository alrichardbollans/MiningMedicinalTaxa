4.16 The effect o f different concentrations o f andrographolide on V-79 cell growth during 24- and 48- hour treatment period. Longer treatment significantly reduced cell growth.In order to determine whether the presence of abnormal centrosome numbers after treatment would be continued in subsequent cell divisions in the absence of andrographolide, V-79 cells that were exposed to various concentrations of the compound were washed with pre-warmed PBS and allowed to grow in fresh medium for a further one and two cell cycles.Table 4.4 and Figure 4.17 shows the data on MTOCs abnormality in V-79 cells growing for 24 hours post-treatment whereas Table 4.5 and Figure 4.18 shows the aberrations observed after two cell cycles (48 hours) after andrographolide removal respectively.Copy /1 7 5Y.

Tetrapolar and multipolar division also registered an increase against negative control but were less than 6% and 4% respectively. It is interesting to note that of the MTOCs aberrations induced, tripolarity in particular can be as high as those observed in continuous treatment with andrographolide. Figure 4.19 compares the induction of MTOCs aberration between the three treatment sets. However, one must also take into account that the occurrence of multiple MTOCs (i.e. tripolar, tetrapolar and multipolar) were higher in untreated cells for these sets o f experiments as compared to negative controls in cells subjected to continuous 24-hour treatment.Mean % Tripolar# Mean % TetrapolarBM ean % Multipolar10 30 50Andrographolide (pM)Copy 11 7 6Y.

The mitotic index for cells treated continuously fell in the presence o f andrographolide due tocytotoxicity.When comparing the data presented in tables 4.1, 4.4 and 4.5, the percentage of cells with more than two spindle poles in the negative control remained mostly constant in value, although slight increase were observed, they were not statistically significant. There were dose-related increases between 10-50pM even after andrographolide removal but these were mostly tripolar in nature. Remarkably, the percentage of cells with tripolar MTOCsCopy I 1 7 8Y. SharifuddinChapter 4remained similar even in the absence of andrographolide, post-treatment. The same can be said about tetra- and multipolar MTOCs values although there was a decrease of tetrapolar cells before it increased again when allowed to progress for another one cell cycle. The mitotic index values also changed with the values were higher for cells that were permitted to proceed through subsequent cell cycles after 24-hour andrographolide challenge. Cells that completed two cell cycles (48 hours) post-treatment showed the highest mitotic index value.Table 4.6 The mean percentage incidence o f condensed chromatin in V-79 cells treated with andrographolide for 24 hours and those that were allowed to recover 24 hours post-treatment.0 0.10 0.1210 0.16 0.1830 0.60* 0.69*50 1.82* 2.07*70 3.62* 4.38*90 5.33* 5.29*^Statistically significant values (p<0.05) against the negative controls.65_c'.ffE 4 oI sQJ(ACTJ 2coo5? 1 0# 0 IFig. 4.21 A graphic comparison in the mean percentage incidence o f condensed chromatin observed between V-79 cells that were treated continuously for 24 hours and those that were allowed to recover 24 hours after andrographolide insult.

SharifuddinChapter 4chromatin frequency between V-79 exposed to andrographolide for 24 hours and those that were permitted to grow for another 24 hours period in the absence of the phytochemical.As the induction of multiple MTOCs was observed in a dose-dependent manner between 10-50pM of continuous exposure to andrographolide, discovering how it affects cell fate was deemed an interesting venture. Table 4.7 shows the data of V-79 cells exposed to andrographolide in the same concentration range and the data displayed graphically as shown in Figure 4.22. Generally, the pattern of the data is supporting the trend observed as shown in Table 4.1 earlier. Abnormal centrosome number promoted aberrant mitoses and the percentage of cells containing more than one nucleus and failed to complete cytokinesis, increased in a dose-dependent fashion with 30pM of the phytochemical.13.28% and 13.73% of the cell population remained as binucleates whereas 1.55% and 1.35% of cells were trinucleates, upon treatment with 30 and 50pM of andrographolide respectively. Statistically significant values (p<0.05) for difference against the negative controls were as shown in Table 4.7. Even though the percentage of tri-, tetra- and multipolar cells generated were lower than the percentage of cells that were shown to have tripolar, tetrapolar and multipolar MTOCs when treated with the same dose of andrographolide, the presence o f more than two spindle poles forced anomalous chromosome migration in different directions manifested by trinucleated, tetranucleated and multinucleated cells. Whereas, the effects observed at higher doses were closely linked to cell viability since most cells challenged with 70 and 90pM of the compound died due to necrosis. As demonstrated in the Chapter 3, V-79 cells exposed to andrographolide for 24 hours experienced reduced cell viability with most cells died primarily via necrosis in a dose-dependent manner.Table 4.7 Cell fate o f V-79 cells after 24-hour treatment with different doses o f andrographolide.0 3.39 0.24 0.13 0.0610 6.85* 0.30 0.25 0.15*30 13.28* 1.55* 0.85* 0.28*50 13.73* 1.35* 0.55* 0.35*70 9.93* 0.70* 0.35* 0.58*90 4.45 0.38 0.08 0.18*^Statistically significant values (p<0.05) against the negative controls.Copy I 180Y.

It turned out that there was still significant presence (p<0.05) o f cells harbouring more than one nucleus in concordance with the MTOCs abnormality data as demonstrated in Tables4.4 and 4.5. Trinucleated cells frequency was prominent so did tetra- and multinucleated cells. Thus, the presence o f abnormal MTOCs polarity promoted multinucleation of V-79 cells even after andrographolide removal.Table 4.8 Cell fate o f V-79 cells after 24-hour treatment with different doses o f andrographolide and subsequently allowed to recover for another 24 hours in the absence o f the phytochemical.0 2.55 0.33 0.03 0.0410 3.08 0.98* 0.20* 0.10*30 6.13* 1.58* 0.50* 0.15*50 7.03* 1.78* 0.63* 0.33*70 3.53* 0.50 0.30* 0.13*90 2.23 0.38 0.10 0.05^Statistically significant values (p<0.05) against the negative controls.Copy I 1 8 1Y.

As shown in Tables 4.9 and 4.10 respectively, MCL-5 cells were observed to generally experienced less effects of andrographolide challenge evident from the percentage of cells harbouring more than one nuclei, especially trinucleates. Figures 4.24 and 4.25 graphically displayed the data obtained. There was a steady accruement of cells containing more than one nucleus in the order o f binucleates > trinucleates > tetranucleates > multinucleates, where binucleated cells were statistically significant between 10-50pM of andrographolide against negative control as observed after 24 hours treatment. The presence of cells with more than two nuclei (tri-, tetra- and multinucleated) were less than 1% of the cell population in all doses tested and again 30pM of the phytochemical induced the highest number whereas 50pM was required to attain statistically significant percentage of multinucleated cells. This suggests that MCL- 5 may be more able to withstand andrographolide challenge than V-79 cells.Copy 1 182Y.

In fact, simple direct comparison between data in Tables 4.9 and 4.10 showed a slight decrease rather than an expected increment, observed between doses 10 to 50pM. Interestingly, the percentage of binucleated cells at 70 and 90pM were higher compared to the cells exposed to the same concentrations but at shorter treatment period. However, these figures should not be interpreted as a direct effect o f andrographolide but merely changes to the number of scorable cells since many cells died due to necrosis.MCL-5 cells were also exposed to a similar concentration range of andrographolide up to 50pM but with a longer treatment period of 120 hours (5 continuous cell cycles) and a similar result emerged. Referring to Table 4.11 and Figure 4.26, shows the percentages of cells arrested with different mitotic outcomes.Copy 1 1 8 4Y.
