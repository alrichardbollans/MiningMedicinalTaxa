Furthermore, the aim of this study was to investi-gate the relationship between computed molecular proper-ties of seven selected systemic antifungal drugs and their plasma protein binding (PPB) data available in literature. Materials and methodsSeven selected systemic antifungal drugs, amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, terbinafine and voriconazole were investigated in this study.The PPB degree data for selected antifungal agents was obtained from relevant literature (Lemke and Wil-liams, 2013; www.drugbank.ca). The values of antifun-gal drugs' molecular descriptors, aqueous solubility (logS), electronic descriptor - polar surface area (PSA), constitu-tional parameter - molecular weight (Mw), geometric de-scriptor - volume value (Vol) and seven different lipophi-licity parameters, logP values (AlogPs, AClogP, milogP, AlogP, MlogP, XlogP2 and XlogP3) were calculated us-ing two different software packages (www.molinspira-tion.com; www.vcclab.org). The selection of most suitable logP value was evaluated on the basis its best agreement with values of PPB obtained from literature. Microsoft Excel 2003 and Origin 7.0 PRO (Origin Lab Corporation, USA) were used for statistical analysis.S6 PP 262550Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 549 - 550 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsResults and discussionAccording to the data obtained from literature, antifungal drugs mostly have relatively similar and high values of plasma protein binding. These values range from 90% for amphotericin B to 99.8% for itraconazole. Ketoconazole, posaconazole and terbinafine have also high and almost equal values of PPB (99%, 98%, 99%, respectively) while fluconazole and voriconazole represent exceptions with their lower values of plasma protein binding (12% and 58% , respectively) (www.drugbank.ca). The five molecular descriptors, logP, PSA, Mw, Vol and logS, for all studied systemic antifungal drugs were calculated using software packages, Virtual Computational Chemistry Laboratory and Molinspiration Depiction Software (www.molinspiration.com; www.vcclab.org).The methods used for logP calculation can be divided into property-based and substructure-based methods and there are two groups of substructure-based methods: fragmental and atom-based. The differences between calculation methods led to distinctions between absolute logP values. It is generally accepted that molecules with high lipophilicity show higher values of plasma protein binding in comparison to the less lipophilic ones with similar properties. Considering all this, in the first stage of the study the relationships between numbered calculated lipophilicity descriptors, logP values, and plasma protein binding data obtained from relevant literature for selected antifungal drugs were investigated using simple linear regression. The best correlation was obtained for the relationship between antifungal drugs' plasma protein binding data and AClogP lipophilicity descriptor. Consequently, lipophilicity descriptor AClogP was chosen for further correlations. Following, the correlations between plasma protein binding data and other calculated molecular descriptors, PSA, Mw, Vol, logS were investigated providing relatively poor correlation (R2 < 0.35). In continuation, the relationships between antifungal drugs' plasma protein binding data and two different molecular descriptors were investigated using multiple linear regression analysis (MLR). The relationship between antifungal drugs' protein binding data and their lipophilicity with application of additional molecular descriptors, Mw, Vol, PSA, logS as additional independent variables provided significantly higher correlations (with R2 varying from 0.81 to 0.85). The obtained relations are presented with following Equations (1)-(4).PPB predicted(%) = 12.699(+-3.213)AClogP + 0.046(+-0.027)Mw + 17.105(+-16.654) (1)With n = 7; R2 = 0.851; S.D. = 15.714; F = 11.451;PPBpredicted(%) = 12.406(+-3.306)AClogP + 0.049(+-0.030)Vol + 19.185(+-16.114) (2)With n = 7; R2 = 0.847; S.D. = 15.922; F = 11.101.PPBpredicted(%) = 14.921(+-3.477)AClogP + 0.097(+-0.072)PSA + 25.055(+-15.557) (3)With n = 7; R2 = 0.823; S.D. = 17.136; F = 9.312;PPBpredicted(%) = 15.144(+-3.618)AClogP - 2.207(+-1.806)logS + 28.532(+-14.628) (4)With n = 7; R2 = 0.814; S.D. = 17.566; F = 8.764.As can be seen the best correlation was obtained using MLR analysis with application of two molecular descriptors, AClogP and Mw or AClogP and Vol data, as independent variables ((Equation (1) and (2)). However, all established correlations can be considered as good with R2 higher than 0.80.ConclusionThe discovery of new pharmacologically active substances and modeling of drugs with antifungal activity led to necessity of predicting drugs properties and their ADME data. The correlations that were found between antifungal drugs' plasma protein binding data and their calculated molecular descriptors, confirmed that lipophilicity accompanied with other molecular properties, such as molecular weight, volume value, polar surface area and aqueous solubility are essential for drugs plasma protein binding. The presented computational technique could be regarded as additional, in vitro approach appropriate for evaluation of plasma protein binding of investigated drugs especially important in design of new synthesized antifungal drugs, since only free drug molecules can interact with the receptor to produce effective therapy results.

While studying albumin, they discovered a slow reacting substance, which stimulated smooth muscle. They named it as a slow react-ing substance - SRS and based on the pharmacologic ac-tivity they managed to conclude that it was a unique sub-stance, found only in immunologically sensitized tissues by an antigen. Decades later, SRS was called anaphylaxis slow reacting substance (SRS-A).Zileuton is absorbed immediately after oral admin-istration and extensively metabolized by CYP and UDP glucuronosyltransferase. Even in this case, initial medi-cine is responsible for the therapeutic effect. Zileuton is a medicine with short effect and a half-life of approximately 2.5 hours and also very much bound to the proteins (93%). Pharmacologic effects of cys-LTs' occur not only as a con-sequence of the activation of cys-LT1 receptor; for exam-ple, cys-LTs' which trigger the vascular smooth muscle contraction (Gorenne et al., 1995). and stimulate expres-sion of the P-selectin generated by endothelial cells via re-ceptor LT2 (Pedersen et al., 1994). Work studied the effect of antileukotriene -Zileuton in the treatment of patients with bronchial asthma and in-creased bronchial reactivity, comparing it with control group treated with salbutamol (beta2 adrenergic receptor agonist) applied via inhalation. Materials and methodsFormation of leukotrienes depends on the lypoxygen-ation of the arachidonic acid by 5-lypoxygenase. Zileuton is an active and powerful inhibitor of the activity of 5-ly-poxygenase and as such inhibits generation of its products. Consequently, besides inhibition of cys-LTs', zileuton also inhibits the formation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which is a powerful chemotactic of other eicosanoids too, which de-pend on the synthesis of leukotriene A4 (LTA4). Theoreti-cally, therapeutic effects of 5-lipoxygenase should include all those seen at the antagonist cys-LT1, but also other ef-fects which include inhibition of the LTB4 and other prod-ucts of 5-lipoxygenase. Pharmacologic effects of cys-LTs' occur not only as a consequence of the activation of cys-LT1 receptor; for ex-ample, cys-LTs' which trigger the vascular smooth muscle contraction (Gorenne et al., 1995) and stimulate expression of the P-selectin generated by endothelial cells via receptor LT2 (Pedersen et al., 1994). Work studied the effect of antileukotriene -Zileuton in the treatment of patients with bronchial asthma and in-creased bronchial reactivity, comparing it with control group treated with salbutamol (beta2 adrenergic receptor agonist) applied via inhalation. SRaw = Raw x ITGVRaw and the SRaw were taken for analyses. Parameters of the lung function are determined with Body plethysmography. Raw and ITGV were registered and specific resistance (SRaw) was calculated. In persons with bronchial asthma and increased bron-chial reactivity (n=21), Zileuton applied in a dose of 600 mg first day (oral route administration, 4 x 1 tabl.). After measurement of initial values, 1 capsule 600 mg of zileu-S6 PP 263552Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 551 - 552 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationston applied and measured Raw and ITGV after 60, 90 and 120 min. In the end, in terms of control, applied salbuta-mol (beta2-adrenergic agonist) in the form of aerosol and in a dose of (2 inh. x 0,2 mg); Raw and ITGV values were measured again and SRaw was calculated. Zileuton, as antagonist of leukotriene receptor (600 mg, tablet) administered orally 2 days in row at home (4 x 600 mg) and after 1 day, respectively 2 days reported at the ambulance and measured initial values, tablet administered orally at the ambulance, and measured Raw and ITGV af-ter 60, 90 and 120 min. At the end, as control, administered salbutamol (beta2-adrenergic agonist) in the form of aero-sol and in a dose of (2 inh. x 0,2 mg), and Raw and ITGV values were measured again and SRaw was calculated. Gained results grouped and analysed. Statistic data processing included determination of the average values (X), standard deviation (SD), standard mistake (SEM), and testing of significance of changes in between groups of pa-tient treated with antileukotriene substances. Gained results tested with a t-test in order to ascertain significant changes in between examined groups. In order to compare groups, utilized was statistic test ANOVA. This test is used in cases when necessary to evaluate more than two groups. Potential mistakes with t - test avoided with ANOVA used as a method of statistic test. Results and discussionResults of this research, in patients with bronchial asthma, indicate that Zileuton administered in a dose of 600 mg first day (oral route administration, 4 x 1 tabl.) has not caused significant decrease of the specific resistance (SRaw) of airways (p value 0.1 > Apha 0.05). Zileuton, administered 2 days in a row in a dose of 600 mg (4 x 1 tabl. per day), has caused significant decrease of the specific resistance (SRaw) of airways (p value 0.03 < Alpha 0.05). Treatment of the control group with salbuta-mol (agonist of beta2-adrenergic receptor) is also efficient in removal of the increased bronchomotor tonus, causing significant decrease of the resistance (Raw), respectively of the specific resistance (SRaw), (p value 0.05 = Alpha 0.05). Antagonists of leukotriene in doses administered 1 and 2 days after administration of Zileuton at home in the same pa-tient, does not significantly cause decrease of the arterial sys-tolic and diastolic pressure (AP) (p value 0.1 > Alpha 0.05). Clinical trials with antileukotriene medicines were quite heterogeneous in response to the therapy, with pa-tients that can be classified in two groups, those "respond-ing" on the treatment and those "not responding" on it. For patients responding to the treatment with antileukotri-ene, heart, lungs, and blood treatment clinics have recog-nized these medicines as alternative to inhaled steroids, in small doses, in order to maintain slight chronic asthma un-der the control. More studies are needed to define the role of these medicines in moderate and severe asthma. (Barnes and Miller, 2000). Some clinical trials indicated that an-tagonists of leukotriene have an affinity in reduction of the dose of inhaled steroids necessary to control asthma exac-erbations (Jarvis and Markham, 2000). Side effects of the patients administering zileuton are similar to those of patients administering placebo. In esti-mated 4 to 5% of the patients administering zileuton there is an increase of liver enzymes responsibly within 2 first months of treatment. Hepatic enzymes should be moni-tored in patients that have just entered the treatment with zileuton, in order to be protected from a potential toxici-ty of the liver. ConclusionResults of this research indicate that Zileuton, ad-ministered in a dose of 600 mg (oral route administration, first day 4 x 1 tabl.) in patients with bronchial asthma has not caused significant decrease of the specific resistance (SRaw) of airways, (p value 0.1 > Alpha 0.05). Antileukotriene - Zileuton administered 2 days in a row, in a dose of 600 mg (4 x a day 1 tabl. ), has caused sig-nificant decrease of the specific resistance (SRaw) of air-ways (p value 0.03 < Alpha 0.05). Treatment of the control group with salbutamol (agonist of beta2-adrenergic recep-tor) is effective in removal of the increased bronchomo-tor tonus, by causing significant decrease of the resistance (Raw), namely specific resistance (SRaw), (p value 0.05 = Alpha 0.05). This suggests that Zileuton is a powerful selective in-hibitor of the activity of 5-lypoxygenase and as such inhibits generation of its products. Consequently, besides inhibition of cys-LTs' formation, Zileuton also inhibits the formation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), which is a powerful chemotactic of other eicosanoids too, which depend on the synthesis of lekotriene A4 (LTA4). According to gained results, the ef-fect of antileukotriene (Zileuton) is not immediate after oral administration, but the powerful effect of the Zileuton seen only after two days of inhibition of cys-LTs', and inhibition of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and A4 (LTA4) based on the re-cordings made of the specific resistance of airways (SRaw).ReferencesBarnes, N.C., Miller, C.J., 2000.
