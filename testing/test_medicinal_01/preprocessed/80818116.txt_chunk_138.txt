This result indicates that the addition of ursodeoxycholic acid may significantly increase doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cell line. In the following step we wanted to dissect the effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by determining the expression of apoptosis-related genes Bax and Bcl-2. The expression of a pro-apoptotic gene Bax in cells treated with doxorubicin alone was 3.22 fold higher (p < 0.01), and in the group of cells co-treated with doxorubicin and ursodeoxycholic acid was 2.28 fold higher in comparison with control group (p < 0.01). The expression of anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 in the doxorubicin treated cells was 1.42 fold higher (p < 0.01), whereas in co-treated cells was 1.25 fold decreased compared to the control (p < 0.01). These results indicate that co-treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid reduced the expression of both apoptosis-related genes compared to cells treated with doxorubicin alone, which is in agreement with well known antioxidant and apoptosis-reducing function of ursodeoxycholic acid (Perez and Briz, 2009). When we assessed the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, a parameter that determines the susceptibility of cells to the apoptosis, the values of this ratio in doxorubicin treated cells was highly significantly increased in both doxorubicin-treated and ursodeoxycholic acid-co-treated cells, 6.26 +- 0.7 (p < 0.01) and 7.89 +- 1.1 (p < 0.01), respectively, compared to control group of cells 2.9 +- 0.9. Even though the value of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the group of co-treated cells was higher compared to doxorubicin treated cells, the difference was not statistically significant. However, the results were in accordance with the results of MTT test indicating that the co-treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid had driven MCF-7 cells into apoptosis in greater extent than treatment with doxorubicin alone.ConclusionThe simultaneous treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid in non-toxic concentrations and doxorubicin significantly increased the cytotoxicity towards MCF-7 cell line, by promoting the programmed cell death, apoptosis, at least on the transcriptomic level. Therefore, ursodeoxycholic acid may be exploited as useful agent in developing novel pharmaceutical formulations or antineoplastic strategies relying on doxorubicin protocol.AcknowledgmentSupported by the Ministry of education, science and technological development, the Republic of Serbia, Grant III41012.ReferencesPerez, M.J., Briz, O., 2009.

The effect of bile acids on drug transporters is currently a challenging topic due to consequences on efficacy and safety profiles of drugs. Research on this topic has been mostly restricted to the impact of bile acids on the eukaryotic drug transporters what is confirmed by several studies (Yang et al., 2011). Up to date there has been no study on bile acids interactions with multidrug transporters in probiotic bacteria. Given that bile acids interact with intestinal microbiota as significant drug-metabolizing system that may be the cause of inter- and intra- individual differences in drug metabolism (Stojancevic et al., 2014) the purpose of this study was to use computational servers and softwares to assess the binding affinities of different bile acids towards bacterial multidrug transporters and to propose the mechanism of their influence on drug transport through bacterial membrane (Djanic et al., 2016b). Materials and methodsAs a representative of gut microflora, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (LA) is chosen, as the most commonly commercially used probiotic bacterial strains and also abundant part of gut microflora. Docking study was carried out to estimate the binding affinities of three different bile acids: cholic acid (CA), 12-monoketocholic acid (MKC) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) to drug membrane transporters in LA. Docking step was performed using molecular docking program SwissDock web service which uses calculations performed in the CHARMM force field with EADock DSS. The lower estimated free energy of binding indicates the higher binding affinity. The list of multidrug transporters for LA was obtained from relational database - TransportDB, The amino acid sequence of all studied transport proteins were obtained from NCBI database in FASTA format. The 3D structures of proteins were predicted by I-TASSER server (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement). The obtained 3D structures are given a confidence score (c-score) which was in the range of [-5, 2] where a higher value indicates a model with a more reliable structure and vice-versa. Proteins with c-score below -1.5 were not taken into further consideration and were not analyzed in docking studies. 3D structures of CA and DCA in mol2 format were obtained from ZINC database. Structure of MKC was drawn in ACD/ChemSketch, a freeware for chemical structure drawing and subsequent optimization from ACD Labs.Results and discussionAccording to data available at TransportDB database, the total number of multidrug transport proteins in LA was 30, 14 from ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily and 16 from secondary transporters. The majority of predicted S6 PP 270566Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 565 - 566 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentations3D structures had a high confidence score reflecting the reliability of the obtained structures. Four proteins did not fulfill these criteria and were not further analyzed in docking studies. In other words, 26 transporters were included in docking studies. The molecular docking results revealed that studied bile acids exhibit different binding affinities towards multidrug transporters in LA. The lowest binding energy for the majority of examined transporters was estimated for MKC. Namely, from all 26 examined transport proteins, 13 (50%) gave the lowest binding energy in combination with MKC. The most prominent effect of MKC was observed in the cases of LBA1821 from ATP family and LBA0753 from the family of secondary transporters. Analyzing docking results, the second ranked bile acid was CA that gave the lowest docking result with 7 of 26 (26.9%) transporters. The most notable differences in docking score, regarding the CA was estimated for LBA0575, ABC transporter in LB. For only 6 transporters (23.0%), DCA was estimated to have the highest affinity compared to other examined bile acids. This is the most expressed in the case of LBA0552, secondary transporter. The correlation between hydrogen bond interactions and estimated free binding energies for all studied transport proteins revealed weak inverse relationship between the variables. Based on the calculated Pearson's coefficient, it may be concluded that, in addition to the hydrogen-bond interactions, the hydrophobic interactions also contribute to the stability of analyzed complexes. ConclusionThe molecular docking results presented in this study revealed that studied bile acids exhibit different binding affinities towards multidrug transporters in LA that may be the consequence of different chemical structures. The greatest effect of MKC for the majority of studied transport proteins suggests that keto group at the position 12 has a significant influence on the properties of MKC and consequently, on the interactions with membrane transporters. These findings might have a role in the prediction of bile acids and probiotics influence on drug pharmacokinetics. Computational techniques are expected to increase its contribution to structural pharmacology investigation of membrane transporters and their implication in drug metabolism. However, in order to confirm the predictive strength of these computationally obtained results, further in vitro and in vivo experimental validation is highly recommended.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Republic of Serbia, Grant No. 41012.ReferencesDjanic, M., Pavlovic, N., Stanimirov, B., Vukmirovic, S., Nikolic, K., Agbaba, D., Mikov, M., 2016a.

The ob-jective of TDM is to evaluate the drug concentration in or-der to maximize the pharmacotherapeutic effects and min-imize the toxic effects (Gross, 2001). Several countries developed a specific service dealing with the therapeutic monitoring of drugs. In other countries this service is pro-vided by the pharmaceutic department, clinical pharmacy department, or the clinical biochemistry department (Mur-phy et al., 2007).The Therapeutic Monitoring of drugs is considered as a helpful instrument in case of drugs with a narrow ther-apeutic index, drugs highly bound to the proteins, drugs with high potential of interactions ecc. There are many fac-tors influencing the therapeutic drug monitoring such as diseases, non-compliance, habits, sampling time ecc. How-ever it is possible to retroactively evaluate the appropriate-ness of the interventions undertaken through the results ob-tained from monitoring of the serum drug levels (Burton et al., 2006).Carbamazepine is an antiepileptic drug presenting a narrow therapeutic range and a complicated pharmacoki-netics, thus representing a candidate drug to undergo ther-apeutic monitoring (Levy et al., 2002; Neels et al., 2004).The objective of this study was to evaluate the appro-priateness of the interventions through the therapeutic car-bamazepine monitoring in the neurology service in the University Hospital Mother Teresa in Tirana.Materials and methodsThe medical records regarding the monitoring of the serum levels for carbamazepine over 6 years (2008-2010 and 2013-2015) were evaluated. Data analyses were per-formed using Chi square test. Information was received from the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory and the Neurol-ogy Service in the University Hospital Mother Teresa in Tirana. Results and discussionWe analyzed all medical records for patients who un-derwent the measurement of the serum level of carbamaze-pine for two separated periods: 2008-2010 and 2013-2015. All these requests for the measurement of carbamazepine serum level were performed by neurologists in order to identify whether the missing therapeutic effect or the pres-ence of toxicity was dedicated to the abnormal serum lev-el of the drug. The overall number of carbamazepine mea-surements in the Clinical Biochemical Laboratory was for the years 2008-2010 respectively 286, 249 and 227; and for the years 2013-2015 the measurements were 34, 49 and 51 respectively. All measurements were performed through immunoassay methods. Standard dose regimens for car-bamazepine resulted in insufficient serum concentration in 37% of the cases for the measurements performed in the years 2008-2010 and in 23% of the cases for the measure-S6 PP 271568Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 567 - 568 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsments performed in the years 2013-2015. Standard dose regimens for carbamazepine resulted in overdose concen-trations in 34% of the cases for the measurements per-formed in the years 2008-2010 and in 21% of the cases for the measurements performed in the years 2013-2015. Cli-nicians' response to the abnormal concentrations of carba-mazepine were appropriate in 65% of the interventions in the first 3 years and this appropriateness raised to 98% in the second three years of evaluation (p<0.01).A limitation of our study consists in the evaluation of restricted information. It would be helpful if we could an-alyze also the factors leading to the abnormal serum lev-els of carbamazepine, the concomitant therapies which pa-tients were taking at the time of serum level measurement.Our study demonstrated better therapeutic outcomes after evaluation of the first period of TDM application on carbamazepine levels. This finding is in accordance with similar studies where better results were obtained after crit-ical evaluation of the experience gathered (Patsalos et al., 2008; Shakya et al., 2008).The evaluation of the therapeutic interventions through the therapeutic monitoring of carbamazepine showed that the experience gained over the first three years' experi-ence with this evaluation brought to the better understand-ing of the real need to perform the therapeutic monitoring of carbamazepine. This led to a significant cost contain-ment in performing this evaluation.
