Food intake, energy expenditure and body adiposity are homeostatical-ly regulated, and malfunctions of this balance can cause increased fat storage and obesity (Farooqi and O'Rahilly, 2005;Murphy and Bloom, 2006). Mammals have two types of adipose tissue (fat): brown and white, with oppos-ing functions. Mammalian white fat is an important reg-ulator of the whole body homeostasis that stores energy in form of triglycerides. The brown adipose tissue catab-olises lipids to produce heat, function mediated by the tis-sue-specific uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) abundantly pres-ent in the brown fat mitochondria. The brown adipose tis-sue differentiation can be induced by prolonged cold ex-posure and beta-adrenergic stimulation which leads to ele-vated intracellular cyclic AMP (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004; Young et al., 1984). The classical brown fat is pres-ent at distinct anatomical sites, including the interscapular, perirenal and axillary depots. Brown fat cells also emerge in subcutaneous white fat (known as "beige" cells) in re-sponse to cold or exercise (Cousin et al., 1992; Guerra et al., 2001), a process referred to as fat "browning". Promo-tion of increased brown fat development increases ener-gy expenditure and white fat loss, and leads to improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, without caus-ing dysfunction in other tissues and is associated with a lean and healthy phenotype (Lowell et al., 1993), suggest-ing the manipulation of the fat stores as an important ther-apeutic objective.Gut microbiota regulates metabolic homeostasisThegastrointestinal tract is the body's largest endo-crine organ that releases a number of regulatory peptide hormones that influence many physiological processes (Badman and Flier, 2005). The intestinal microbiota co-develops with the host, and its composition is influenced by several physiological changes (Koren et al., 2012; Rid-aura et al., 2013). The colonization starts immediately af-ter birth and is initially defined by the type of delivery and early feeding. A wide range of pathologies have been as-sociated with alterations of the gut microbial composition (e.g. : asthma, arthritis, autism or obesity) (Sommer and Backhed, 2013). The intestinal microbiota can also influ-ence the whole-body metabolism by affecting energy bal-ance (Backhed et al., 2004; Koren et al., 20012; Ridaura et al., 2013; Turnbaugh et al., 2006). Transplantation of mi-crobiota from obese human, or animal donors to germ free mice is sufficient to promote increased adiposity and insu-lin resistance of the new host, suggesting that microbiota alone is sufficient to induce these metabolic changes. The mechanisms and the nature of the phenotypic and morpho-logical alterations that regulate the energy homeostasis of the new host following microbiota transplantation remain poorly understood.Our recent findings show that cold exposure leads to marked shift of the microbiota composition, referred to as cold microbiota (Chevalier et al., 2015). Transplantation of the cold microbiota to germ-free mice is sufficient to increase insulin sensitivity of the host, and enable toler-ance to cold partly by promoting the white fat browning, leading to increased energy expenditure and fat loss. Dur-ing prolonged cold however, the body weight loss is at-PL 726Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 25 - 26 (2016)Mirko Trajkovskitenuated, caused by adaptive mechanisms maximizing ca-loric uptake and increasing intestinal, villi and microvil-li lengths. This increased absorptive surface is transferable with the cold microbiota leading to altered intestinal gene expression promoting tissue remodelling and suppression of apoptosis - effect diminished by co-transplanting the most cold-downregulatedbacterial strain Akkermansiamu-ciniphila during the cold microbiota transfer. Our results demonstrate the microbiota as a key factor orchestrating the overall energy homeostasis during increased demand ((Chevalier et al., 2015). We recently also showed that the development of functional beige fat is promoted by micro-biota depletion either by means of antibiotic treatment or in germ-free mice within the white adipose tissues (Suarez-Zamorano et al., 2015). This leads to improved glucose tol-erance, insulin sensitivity and decreased white fat and ad-ipocyte size in lean mice and obese mice. Such metabolic improvements are mediated by eosinophil infiltration and enhanced type 2 cytokine signaling and M2 macrophage polarization in the white fat depots of microbiota-deplet-ed animals. The metabolic phenotype and the browning of the subcutaneous white fat are impaired by suppression of the type 2 signaling and are reversed by recolonization of the antibiotic-treated, or the germ-free mice with microbes (Suarez-Zamorano et al., 2015). These results provide in-sights into the microbiota-fat signaling axis and the beige fat development in health and metabolic disease. The re-duced adiposity, and improved glucose tolerance and insu-lin sensitivity of the microbiota depleted obese animalssug-gestthat browning of the white fat depots by modulation of the microbiota composition could be a new approach for combatingobesity and the associated metabolic disorders. ConclusionMicrobiota transplantation was reported almost 50 years ago, and has re-gained interest as a treatment option for several pathologies. In the context of the increased obe-sity prevalence and energy unbalance, our studies show-ing microbiota changes that promote fat browning, weight loss and increased energy dissipation, imply microbiota as a key player mediating the tight control of the energy ho-meostasis with large therapeutic potential.ReferencesBackhed, F., Ding, H., Wang, T., Hooper, L.V., Koh, G.Y., Nagy, A., Semenkovich, C.F. and Gordon, J.I. 2004.The gut microbiota as an environmental factor that regulates fat storage.
