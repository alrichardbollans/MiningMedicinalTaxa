The patients received300mg berberine/day for 24 months, with 2-week interruptionsevery 5 months. The authors recorded lower CRP (C-reactiveprotein), MDA and SOD levels after treatment, but withoutsignificant changes in creatinine, arterial pressure, or glycaemialevels. These results support the renal protective effect ofberberine through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects(Dai et al., 2015).Another animal study tested the renoprotective effect ofberberine after administration of HgCl2 (mercury chloride).This substance induces hepato-renal damage by increasing theoxidative stress (increases lipid peroxidation and NO levels, andlowers glutathione and SOD levels as well as the activity of otherprotective enzymes). Administration of HgCl2 increased the AST(aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase),and ALP (alkaline phosphatase) levels, compared to the controlgroup. However, pretreatment with berberine lowered theseenzymes significantly. In addition, both urea and creatinine levelswere significantly increased in the HgCl2 group vs. the controlgroup, and again pretreatment with berberine prevented thesechanges. Additionally, the authors recorded higher pro-oxidantand lower antioxidant levels in the intervention group. Thesedata support the hepatic and renal protective effects of berberine.Other studies performed on animal models with CCl4-inducedhepatotoxicity demonstrated the same effect (Othman et al.,2014).In addition, berberine can lower the nephrotoxicity causedby cisplatine. In an animal study, berberine was administeredin progressive doses of 1, 2, 3mg/kg, orally, for 2 successivedays, starting 2 days after cisplatine administration. After thelast doses of berberine, the animals were sacrificed and thekidneys were examined by the pathologist. The results showedsignificant histological improvement and a reduction in NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated Bcells), TNF a, COX2 an iNOS levels, all of which supportthe anti-inflammatory effect of berberine (Domitrovic' et al.,2013).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55743Neag et al.

The beneficial effectof berberine on this animal model resided in its influenceon cellular and humoral immunity through the inhibition oflymphocyte proliferation (especially CD4), and the decrease inpro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF a; Li et al., 2014).Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is anestablished model of multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis isa one of the most common diseases of the central nervoussystem (CNS) and involves neurodegenerative and inflammatoryprocesses, and autoimmune demyelination (Ransohoff et al.,2015). The blood-brain barrier permeability and changes inmatrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels in the cerebrospinal fluidand brain were studied using this model (Ma et al., 2010). MMPsmay be involved in demyelination and their activity in tissuesdepends on the balance between their level and their tissueinhibitors. MMP2 and MMP9 are the main endoproteinasesinvolved in the migration of lymphocytes in CNS and in alteringthe BBB (blood brain barrier) (Avolio et al., 2003). Berberine has abeneficial effect in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitisby inhibiting the activity of MMP9, reducing BBB permeabilityand, consecutively, by decreasing the inflammatory cellularinfiltration of the CNS (Ma et al., 2010).The current therapy used for inflammatory bowel diseases,including glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents, hasa low level of safety. The effect of berberine was studiedin combination with 5-ASA (5-aminosalicylic acid) vs. 5-ASAalone using an experimental animal model with DSS (dextransulfate sodium)-induced colitis. The authors analyzed the levelFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org August 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 55744Neag et al. Berberine: Botanical Occurrence, Traditional Uses, Extraction and Bioactivitiesof proinflammatory cytokines in the animal gut. A decrease inCOX2, IL6, and IL23 mRNA levels was observed in animalstreated only with 5-ASA, whereas animals treated with both 5-ASA and berberine had a reduction in mRNA levels for COX2,IL6, IL23 as well as for TNF alfa and IL12b. This beneficial effectcould partially be attributed to the inhibition of NF-kB and thereduction in JAK2 phosphorylation (through the influence on theJAK/STAT pathway) by both 5-ASA and berberine (Li et al., 2015;Figure 3).Another study demonstrated that berberine increases thecorticosteroid level in rats with experimentally-induced colitis.This engendered the theory that its beneficial effect may also beattributed to the increase in endogenous glucocorticoid levels,compounds with well-known therapeutic effect in inflammatorybowel disease (Minaiyan et al., 2011).CONCLUSIONA review of the available scientific literature shows thatthe traditional medical uses of berberine-containing plantshave been evaluated by modern pharmacological studies.Different species of berberine-rich plants have multiplepharmacological and therapeutic actions, such as antioxidantand immunomodulatory effects, protective action on thecardiovascular system, liver and kidney, endothelial relaxation,regulator on glucose metabolism and atherosclerosis, whichcan all be explained by the presence of berberine as wellas other phyto constituents (when dealing with berberine-containing plant extracts). Moreover, the effects of berberinevary according to its origin (different plants or pharmaceuticalproducts) and its concentration, depending on the very diverseextraction and detection techniques already described. Overtime, modern extraction techniques were increasingly preferredto classical ones. Since classical methods are generally time- andsolvent-consuming processes, modern extraction techniquessuch as USE, MAE, UPE, SFE, and PLE are seen as betteralternatives to overcome these limitations. Furthermore,berberine, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatoryeffects, has several clinical applications in many disorders,from inflammatory conditions to the metabolic syndrome.However, there are some traditional uses that have not yetbeen completely elucidated, and further studies are needed.Therefore, extensive studies on the potential of plants containingberberine that have shown aforementioned pharmacologicalactivities should go through additional in vitro and in vivostudies.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSMN, AM, JE, and RP have conceived and designed the structureof the manuscript, data collection, and drafting, as well as itsrevision.
