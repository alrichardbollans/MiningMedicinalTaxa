Recommendations for conducting hold-time studiesHold time is a period of time during which materials can be stored under defined conditions and will retain their quality within the specified limits. This implies that hold times should be established for the materials at different phases of manufacturing, so one can be sure that holding didn't compromise the quality of the finished product.Hold times should be established based on scientific data. It is recommended that the test is to be performed on one batch prior to registration of the product. All tests should be performed using validated stability-indicating methods. Storage conditions of samples are required to be the same as for the quarantine area or manufacture stage (WHO, 2015). Apart from that, sample should be stored in a simulated package mimicking the packaging of the bulk product (Huynh-Ba, 2009; WHO, 2015). This means that containers should be made of the same material and us-ing same closure system as the system in the manufactur-ing stage. If there is a risk of substance's degradation as a result of oxidation processes, headspace in the containers should also be tested. It is necessary to determine the ratio of headspace to contents in the containers, so degradation of substance is unlikely to occur (WHO, 2015). S4 PP 207436Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 435 - 436 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyData to support holding times could be collected dur-ing drug development, on a pilot or validation batches. If the product is already on the market, guidance (WHO, 2015) leaves a possibility to perform retrospective hold-time studies. Collected data should be processed statisti-cally in order to note trends or to establish limits. Study should be performed through a period defined in the guid-ance, and not beyond that. It isn't necessary to prolong study until the lowest limit of quality is achieved. This ap-proach is based on a "most probable" as opposed to "worst case" approach. For example, 90 days are enough time to keep core tablets as intermediates in the coated tablet man-ufacturing, to study hold-time stability (WHO, 2015). General guidance on hold-time studies (WHO, 2015) provides examples of stages, tests and study times that may be performed for a coated tablet. Coated tablet have been chosen as an example, since tablets are the most widely used dosage form. Apart from that, manufacture of tablets and, especially, coated tablets can be a complex process, including a variety of manufacturing stages (Armstrong, 2007). Each stage can, in some way, influence the quality of the final product.Once hold time is established, intermediates and bulk products should not be stored beyond this period.ConclusionHold-time study plays an important role in the manu-facturing of drug products in the GMP environment. The maximum hold time for intermediates and bulk pharma-ceuticals should be established in order to continue their processing or start the packaging of the drug products be-fore their quality becomes compromised.

It is a highly lipophilic compound whose partition coefficient is 2.36 when measured at 20 degC. Lorazepam, as an amphiphil-ic substance, has two pKa values (1.3 and 11.5) determined spectrophotometrically in aqueous buffers. It is main-ly used in different dosage forms as an active substance. The injectable solution comes in 1 mL ampoules contain-ing 2 or 4 mg lorazepam. As derivative of 1,4-benzodiaz-epines, has certain limitations in pharmaceutical technol-ogy due to its poor solubility in water. The aqueous solu-bility of lorazepam, particle size 8.9 mm, is 0.0485 mg/mL (Hadziabdic and Hadzovic, 2005-2006). Often, in a certain volume of water, an adequate concentration of the drug can-not be achieved during formulation of a liquid dosage form due to the low solubility of the drug (Jinal et al., 2012). This study investigated the use of the traditional sol-ubilization approaches to increase the solubility of loraz-epam. Our aim was to investigate the solubility of loraz-epam in phosphate buffer solutions, in water/cosolvents mixtures (cosolvents: ethanol, propylene glycol, polyeth-ylene glycol 200 and 400) (Corrigan and Healy, 2007; Vemula et al., 2010), and in water/surfactants mixtures [surfactants: Tween 80, Tween 20, Brij 35, sodium cho-late, sodium deoxycholate, sodium taurocholate] (Corri-gan and Healy, 2007; Rangel-Yagui et al., 2005) as well as its solubility in water/cyclodextrins mixtures [cyclo-dextrins: a-cyclodextrin (a-CD), b-cyclodextrin (b-CD), 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (2-HP-bCD)] (Loftsson and Brewster, 2010; Sathesh Babu et al., 2008). The main objective was to find the most suitable method for provid-ing good solubility of lorazepam and thus its formulation in a liquid dosage form.Materials and methodsMaterialsUsed chemicals were obtained from: Lorazepam (LZ, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany); Acidum sulfuricum 95-97% and Methanolum (Kemika, Croatia); Acidum hydrochlo-ricum 37%, Disodium hydrogen phosphate and Potassi-um dihydrogen phosphate (Alkaloid, Macedonia); Acidum phosphoricum 85% (Fluka, Chemika, Switzerland); eth-anol 96%, Polyethylene glycol 200, Polyethylene gly-col 400 and Propylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany); Tween 20, Tween 80 and Brij 35 (Merck, Germany); So-dium cholate, Sodium deoxycholate, Sodium taurocho-late, a-CD, b-CD and 2-HP-bCD (Fluka, Chemika, Swit-zerland). Solubility studiesThe solubility of LZ was estimated by the solubility method of Higuchi and Connors (1965). Solubility mea-surements and the determination of saturation concentra-tions were carried out by adding excess amounts of loraze-pam to phosphate buffer solutions (pH 2.0-8.0), water/co-solvent mixtures (concentrations 1-60% w/w), water/sur-factants mixtures (concentrations 1-20% w/w, for anion-ic surfactants and 1-35% w/w, for non-ionic surfactants). Concentrations of cyclodextrins were selected based on S4 PP 208438Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 437 - 438 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentationstheir solubility in water. Testing of LZ solubility with the addition of a-CD in aqueous solutions was carried out by its addition in concentrations up to 14%. The testing of LZ solubility was carried out in concentrations up to 1.8% of aqueous solutions of b-CD. The testing of LZ solubility with the addition of 2-HP-b-CD in aqueous solutions was carried out by its addition in concentrations up to 40%. The concentrations of dissolved LZ in tested solutions were de-termined using a Shimadzu UV-1601, UV VIS spectropho-tometer (Shimadzu, Japan).Results and discussionIt was found that LZ solubility was decreased with an increasing pH. When the pH value is lower, the percent-age of protonation of lorazepam is higher. Protonation at low pH occurs at the nitrogen atom in position 4. Deprot-onation occurs at a high pH with the loss of the hydrogen atom from the 3-hydroxyl group (Barrett et al., 1973).To prepare the aqueous solution of LZ (2 mg/mL), it is necessary to have more than 50% (w/w) of propylene gly-col, or more than 40% (w/w) of polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene glycol 200 or ethanol. To completely dissolve 4 mg/mL LZ in water more than 50% (w/w) of polyeth-ylene glycol 400 or polyethylene glycol 200 or less than 50% (w/w) of ethanol is needed. It is evident that LZ mole-cules preferably solubilize in a nonpolar environment rath-er than polar (aqueous) surroundings. The concentration of the solvents that enable this drug to be solubilized in water is far higher than that allowed for daily intake. Increase of surfactants concentration in water leads to LZ solubility enhancement linearly. The best solubility was achieved with sodium taurocholate, of all the tested bile salts, while the best LZ solubility in water was achieved with Brij 35, of all the tested non-ionic surfactants (Alkha-mis et al., 2003; Rangel-Yagui et al., 2005). To dissolve 2 mg/mL of LZ in water, more than 15% of sodium cholate, more than 5% of sodium deoxycholate, or less than 10% of sodium taurocholate concentrations are needed. To make a LZ concentration in liquid form of 2 mg LZ/mL of water, more than 5% of Tween 80, more than 7% of Tween 20, or less than 3% Brij 35 is needed. To dissolve 4 mg/mL of LZ in water, more than 20% of sodium cho-late, ~15% of sodium deoxycholate or less than 15% of so-dium taurocholate is needed. To dissolve 4 mg of LZ/mL of water, 20% of Tween 80, more than 15% of Tween 20 or less than 7% Brij 35 should be used. The surfactants with higher HLB values were better solubilizers. The increase of LZ solubility in aqueous solutions of chosen cyclodextrins, compared to its solubility in water. The solubility of LZ is increased 6.5-fold at 14% of a-CD, 4.38-fold at 1.8% b-CD, and 170.1-fold at 40% of 2-HP-b-CD. The changes in the solubility of LZ resulting from the addition of various concentrations of a-CD, b-CD and 2-HP-b-CD were used to plot phase solubility diagrams and to evaluate the stoichiometry and stability constant of the resultant complex. The phase solubility diagrams ob-tained are linear and show characteristics of AL-type of solubility curve. This is attributed to the formation of a sol-uble complex. The apparent stability constants (K1:1) were estimated from the straight line of the phase solubility dia-grams according to equation of Higuchi and Connors (Hi-guchi and Connors, 1965; Mosher and Thompson, 2007). In this case, the K1:1 values obtained followed the order 2-HP-b-CD > b-CD > a-CD, reflecting the greater affinity of modified cyclodextrin for LZ compared with their par-ent a-CD and b-CD. ConclusionBased on the results, the changes in the pH value of the media do not lead to a greater solubility of lorazepam. Of the cosolvents used, the greatest increase in solubility of lorazepam in water was achieved with ethanol. Of the bile salts used, sodium taurocholate showed the best solubili-zation ability, while Brij 35 was the best of the non-ionic surfactants. The solubility of lorazepam with the cyclodex-trin derivative, 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin was bet-ter than natural cyclodextrins. Surfactants have the high-est ability of solubilization of lorazepam in water. Thus, the study generates an array of data for solubilization of lorazepam using various pharmaceutically accepted tech-niques which could be useful while formulating liquid dos-age forms of lorazepam.ReferencesAlkhamis, K.A., Allaboun, H., Al-Momani, W.Y., 2003.
