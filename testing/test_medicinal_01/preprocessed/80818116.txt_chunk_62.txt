Gender differences in types of dietary supplements are apparent. Males were more likely to consume supplements to build muscle (p = 0.006), and females were more likely to consume supple-ments to increase weight (p = 0.002). The most common forms of dietary supplements being used are multivitamin, or individual vitamin/mineral prep-arations (particularly vitamin C). This finding is consistent with the data reported from other study (Kang et al., 2016; Moreno et al., 2014). This supplement, as the main report-ed supplement used among interns, indicates that they may be concerned about their nutritional adequacy in general. Thus, they selected a type of supplement providing a vari-ety of nutrients. Some studies shows the most commonly cited reasons for usage are to maintain or improve health, to increase en-ergy, to build muscle or increase weight, to decrease body fat or weight loss, to increase athletic ability, to help heal injury or illness, or because of an inadequate diet (Bailey et al., 2013; Dwyer et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2016) what is similar with findings in this study.Dietary supplement use in adolescents remains a con-troversial strategy to improve nutrient intakes because, even though their use is associated with lower preva-lence of inadequate intakes, it is also associated with an in-creased risk of excessive intakes.As the dietary supplement industry is now a multi-bil-lion dollar industry, there is growing pressure, and a subse-quent need for research to establish the efficacy and safe-ty of these products particularly for adolescent users. The psychological and educational components of such use cannot be ignored as they play an equally important role in the health and safety of adolescents.ConclusionIt is clear from the results of the current study that di-etary supplementation is popular among adolescents.There is need of further scientific research involving adolescents with the purpose of assessing the beneficial effects and safety of long-term dietary supplements use. More screening tests should be conducted on the consump-tion of dietary supplements among adolescents. Toxicity surveillance should be improved, and regulations of di-etary supplements market should be based on appropriate research. Nutritional education of adolescent is highly im-portant, especially among future medical workers. Finally, regulations on this topic could assist the activi-ty of health professionals and improve the education of the general population about the safe and effective use of di-etary supplements.ReferencesBailey, R.L., Gahche, J.J., Thomas, P.R., Dwyer, J.T., 2013.

General Hospital - Ohrid, Sirma Vojvoda 1, 6000 Ohrid, R. Macedonia, 2Faculty of Pharmacy, Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* spasovskamilena@yahoo.comIntroductionRenal failure (acute and chronic) is described as a de-crease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). It is a condition in which the kidneys are unable to adequately filter tox-ins and waste products from the blood. The cause of acute renal failure (ARF) is divided into sources of renal injury such as pre-renal, intrinsic and post-renal. In ARF there is an increase of blood urine nitrogen (BUN) and serum cre-atinine, and decrease urine production. It is characterized by abrupt decline in renal filtration function (Haller, 2000).In chronic renal failure (CRF) the amount of creati-nine is higher and glomerular filtration rate is lower. CRF is a progressive loss in kidney function over a period of time. In the early stages, there may be no symptoms but it gets worse gradually. The adverse outcome of CRF is kid-ney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death (Park, 2012).Chronic and acute renal failure can be primary distin-guished by different characteristics - cause and duration. CRF is a lifelong problem and it tends to get worse over months or years. Presence of disease in last few months, normochromic anemia, growth failure, and a history of nephritic or nephritic syndrome, high blood pressure, di-abetes mellitus, kidney stone, glomerulonephritis and in-fection make chronic renal failure more likely to happen (Saucier, 2010). Acute renal failure has a sudden onset and can occur as a complication of medical conditions, surgery, or trauma. Healthy kidneys produce a hormone - erythropoietin (EPO). The kidney cells that produce EPO are sensitive to low oxygen levels in the blood that passes through the kidney. EPO prompts the bone marrow to make red blood cells (Radtke, 1979). Red cell production due to the EPO deficiency is too low in CRF and causes development of anemia in this situation. Anemia is also seen in patients with acute renal failure, but the exact relationship between them remains unclear. In addition to anemia, platelet count also seems to be affected by renal disorder. The exact pat-tern of platelet count in patients with renal failure is contro-versial, but several studies revealed the decrease in platelet count in renal failure (Gafter, 1987; Prasad, 2012).The aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of acute and chronic renal failure on severity of anemia and plate-let count.Materials and methodsThis case-control study was conducted on 92 patients with acute renal failure and 50 patients with chronic renal failure, and two groups of 95 and 75 individuals as con-trols. At first, all patients with proven renal failure were included in the study. Then, patients were divided in two groups of acute (<3 month) and chronic (>3month) based on disease duration. In order to eliminate the influences of sex and age when the observation group and the con-trolled group are compared, each of the two groups was se-lected according to the same sex and similar age. Initially, two separate blood samples were taken from each patient, 2 ml uncoagulated sample harvest for biochemical assay, and EDTA anti coagulated whole blood sample for com-plete blood cell count. To determine the levels of BUN and creatinine, the serums were used, and then complete blood counts were done with EDTA anti coagulated samples. Statistical independent T- test was used to evaluate the significance of the differences between the two groups. P<0.05 was considered as a significant change.S3 PP 126272Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 271 - 272 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionIn groups of patients with acute (53% male, 47% fe-male) and chronic (65% male, 35% female) renal failure, mean age was 56+-15 and 58+-11.5 years, respectively. In controlled groups of acute (49% male, 51% female) and chronic (73% male, 27% female) renal failure, mean age was 61+-12 and 63+-11 years, respectively.The average levels of BUN in patients with acute renal failure were 31.7+-7.4 mmol/L, which is above the normal value, compared to the control group (6.4+-2.1 mmol/L). The average of creatinine in patients with acute renal fail-ure is also above the normal value (256.3+-79.5 mmol/L) compared to the controlled groups (88.4+-35.3 mmol/L).The observation of the group of chronic patients also shows that BUN and creatinine are high (29.9+-8.9 mmol/L and 740.8+-180.4 mmol/L) compared to normal ranges of the controlled group (5.3+-2.4 mmol/L and 88.4+-12.3 mmol/L).The levels of Hb, HCT, MCHC and RBC counts were significantly lower in the patient group in comparison to healthy, non-renal affected people (P < 0.05), and anemia was substantial in patients with acute renal failure.The study has also revealed that acute renal failure did not cause significant thrombocytopenia, and even the platelet count in these patients were slightly higher in com-parison to the controlled group.In patients with chronic renal failure, RBC count, he-moglobin, hematocrit level, MCHC, and platelet count are significantly lower than the controlled group (P < 0.05), but MCH and MCV levels are not significantly different be-tween these two groups (P > 0.05).ConclusionIn acute renal failure the ability of the kidney to elim-inate waste products, regulate acid-base balance, and man-age water homeostasis is rapidly declined. When this im-pairment is prolonged and has entered the chronic phase, the EPO secretion by this organ is decreasing. Low EPO level causes decrease of HCT, MCV, RBC and platelet counts. Therefore, the hematological changes in the blood count can be an early diagnostic marker for kidney failure. ReferencesHaller, M., Schelling, G., 2000. Acute kidney failure.

During the process, cuprous aluminium chloride (CuAlCl4) in an aromatic solvent (by instance toluene) is used in order to form a chemical complex with carbon monoxide, which is further recovered by more than 96%. So, one could con-sider this process as a reliable source of carbon monoxide in the case of downstream manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, some down sides of this pro-cess are associated to the partially poisoning of the copper catalyst, and to some environmental risks mostly related to the disposal of the used catalyst, to the recovery of copper and aluminium, as well as to the impact on human health of the different phases resulted from the process (Chadeesi-ngh, 2011). In this respect, toxicological studies of the different phases resulting from the Cosorb process could bring valuable information related to their potential impact onto human and environmental safety. In this work, an in vivo study of the adverse effects of two phases (organic and inorganic) resulting from the Co-sorb process on skin hydration and barrier level was car-ried-on. For this aim, murine model (C57BL/6N and SKH-1 hairless mice) was used, and the evaluation of the ob-tained results was performed by means of Corneometry and Tewametry.Materials and methodsThe reagents used in this study were of analytical grade and were provided by Merck and Sigma-Aldrich. The in-organic phase was evaluated by High-Resolution Contin-uum Source Atomic Absorption Spectrometer ContrAA 700. It was found that the main metals present in this phase are copper and aluminium, while zinc, chrome and iron are in traces. The analyze of the organic phase by means of gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (Hewlett Pack-ard Gas Chromatograph HP 6890 associated with a Mass Spectrometer HP 5973) showed that the main compounds are toluene (84.46%) and some of its oxidation products (10.1%) (Simu et al., 2016). The in vivo study was performed on 4 months old C57BL/6N and SKH1 male mice (Charles River Labora-tories, Budapest, Hungary), according to the 2010/63/EU Directive (Coricovac et a., 2015; Simu et al., 2016). Mice were fed ad libitum and kept under standard conditions: 12-hours light/dark cycle, constant temperature of 22.5 +- 2 degC, and 55 +- 5% humidity. Each type of mice (C57BL/6N and SKH1) were divided in 4 groups (5 mice/ group) as follows: the control group (1) - no interventions; group 2 in which the mice were treated once, topically, with 200ul of inorganic phase (on the dorsal side); group 3 in which the mice were treated once a day, 5 times/week with 100ul of inorganic phase, and group 4 in which the mice were treated once a day, 5 times/week with 100ul of organic phase. The animals were daily observed both at skin's level, and from behavior changes point of view. The eval-uation of the skin's response to the inorganic and the or-ganic phase's effect was performed by Corneometry and Tewametry.

This is due to the fact that murine skin presents a great number of similarities with human skin.In this work, SKH-1 and C57BL/6N mice were used.
