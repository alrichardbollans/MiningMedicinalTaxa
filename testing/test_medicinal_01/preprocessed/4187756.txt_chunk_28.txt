127 From Rosenthal (1998: 118). 209 And so it is in these particular ways that I suggest herbal medicine users in the United Kingdom are provided with techniques to transform themselves into what we might think of as 'petty engineers of modern life' (cf. Rose 1999), encouraged to take responsibility for and control of their own lives when it comes to their health. This is not a task aimed solely at the optimisation of the biological capacities of the body (e.g. by rebalancing neurochemical levels in the brain or by nourishing nervous systems), it is also aimed at optimising and harnessing coping skills, patient identities, lifestyle awareness and human capabilities by targeting human subjectivity. As I have pointed out, crucial to these grassroots techniques of life optimisation (which extend far beyond the scope of herbal medicine and into the National Health System's patient choice programmes or nutrition awareness campaigns) are firstly, the symbolic frameworks which allow patients to relate to their conditions, and secondly, through these frameworks, the practical treatment regimens as well as the lifestyle advice, which allow patients to take appropriate control of their lives and care of their bodies and subjectivities. In this way herbal medicine can propose particular models "for setting up and developing relationships with the self, for self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-examination, for the decipherment of the self by oneself, for the transformations that one seeks to accomplish with oneself as object" (Foucault 1985: 29). In other words, herbal medicine provides users with an ethics of lifestyle management in which the consumption of herbal remedies for certain conditions and symptoms is but one element of the ascesis required in an overall ethical project of life optimisation, which calls for a permanent scrutiny and adjustment of not just one's daily lifestyle practices but also one's cognitive meaning frameworks or lifeworlds. It is a kind of psy-political project of self-realisation through technique. There is to be balance between work and rest, moderation in the toxins one consumes, sufficient attendance to emotional and spiritual health through spending time with family and friends, or taking a break from it all in the countryside, balance in the diet one consumes as well as adequate physical exercise to keep one's body tuned. But, equally importantly, there is also to be coherence and reassurance in the ways in which one relates to any vicissitudes that might arise; disorientation is to be counteracted with a meaning framework-facilitated grounding or mooring. Guiding all of these grassroots techniques of life optimisation is an ethical telos of coherence, responsibility, awareness, reflexivity and activeness, states of being that for most will likely remain just that, goals to be striven for, but nevertheless ones 210 that should never be lost sight of no matter how stressed one's life has become due to the duress of a modern way of life. Revolution and the re-formation of a Vietnamese medicine for Vietnamese people As already underlined, we should not in any way assume uniform assemblages of life-optimising strategies and techniques of the self in different geo-cultural settings. As such, it would be wrong to place emphasis on the kind of self-help approaches to promoting health and quality of life found in British herbal medicine, when addressing the subjectifying effects of very much national efforts to actively promote the use of traditional herbal medicine in Vietnam. Such approaches can certainly be found in Vietnam as I will also demonstrate, but what I will first of all argue here is that the promotion of Vietnamese traditional medicine has aimed not only at tackling the differentiated epidemiologic problems found throughout Vietnam by providing people with improved skills and means to care for their personal health, but equally significantly it has also played an extensive role in attempts to remedy what former Director of the Institute of Traditional Medicine Dr. Nguyen Van Huong diagnosed as a "national inferiority complex caused by long years of foreign domination" (Nguyen 1965: 29-30). One way to overcome this collective inferiority complex, I will suggest, has been to revive traditional medicine not just as a matter of public health but also as an equally pressing matter of national self-esteem. What is more, I will also show how in more recent years, following the opening up of Vietnamese markets and travel restrictions coupled with the gradual dropping of trade embargos against Vietnam, it has been argued that this notion of a Vietnamese medicine is once again under threat, this time from the disorienting effects of globalisation. As highlighted in chapter 4, the modernisation and repopularisation of traditional herbal medicine has been an important component of Vietnam's postcolonial nation-building project, especially so in a context of conflict and embargos. Yet, according to former Minister of Health Pham Ngoc Thach, actively recruiting traditional medicine into public health programmes was about more than 'just' finding pragmatic health solutions in a constrained socio-economic and political situation, it also had to do with the formation of "ideological courage" (Pham 1965: 18). The colonial years, he argued, had left a debasing mark on Vietnamese subjectivities as people had for decades been confronted by a colonial power intent on dismissing their ancient medical traditions as unhygienic, superstitious and indeed harmful. For this reason, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's strategy to develop 211 their traditional medicine should contribute to the "building of national culture" (Nguyen 1965: 22) which, it was underlined, was no easy task in the face of a commanding colonial legacy: To practice a complicated surgical operation with costly ultramodern apparatus imported from abroad gives more prestige than to lecture on hygiene in villages, or to help village cadres complete their medical education... To have been convinced long since of the absolute superiority of so-called western medicine, to have considered traditional medicine a superstition, and now to approach it with respect, with the desire to learn from it, constitutes also a turning point for our medical corps. It needs great courage to devote oneself to scientific research with inadequate technical means, equipment, and scientific knowledge when one always thought that this work requires large, well-equipped laboratories and can be done only by experienced academicians. (Pham 1965: 16-9) In this sense, promoting traditional herbal medicine with the help of techniques of cultural revival in Vietnam has played a significant part in systematic efforts to rehabilitate colonially repressed subjectivities. By providing Vietnam's medical corps as well as the Vietnamese people with concrete means to 'rediscover' their cultural heritage in the medical field, the nation's inferiority complex when it came to medicine could "be eradicated as well as scepticism about the national medical experience and about Southern medication" (Nguyen 1965: 30). While such anthropo-political problematisations have concerned a collective Vietnamese subjectivity they have in turn also generated a host of techniques of cultural revival targeted at individuals in the form of the various grassroots health promotion programmes, refresher courses in Traditional Vietnamese Medicine, training of traditional medicine activists, networks of traditional medicine practitioner associations, and collection expeditions to gather traditional knowledge discussed at length in chapter 4. This has been as much an anthropo-political project of emancipating a collective national identity as it has a public health strategy to protect and promote the health of individuals and sub-populations. It is no coincidence that the most oft-cited phrase in descriptions of ongoing national efforts to rejuvenate traditional medicine is Tue Tinh's 500 year-old maxim "Southern medicine for Southern people". At the same time, it is important to underscore that the emancipation of Vietnamese subjectivities through techniques of cultural revival has without question taken place in the name of modernisation and progress. While it is very often highlighted that the "scorn of Western-trained physicians for traditional medicine derives from an erroneous conception 212 of science and a profound ignorance of the results obtained by traditional medicine" (Pham 1965: 12), this should not be read as some kind of a plea to return to a pre-colonial medical golden age. In looking back at the first ten years of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's efforts to promote health in Vietnam, Pham Ngoc Thach (1965: 3) argued that: Our country in 1955 was not only poor; to age-old misery was added the havoc wrought by several years of war. The population was threatened with famine. Moreover - and we should not be afraid of using the right word - we were a backward country. Centuries of feudalism followed by nearly a century of colonial regime left our country in a state of unthinkable backwardness. People still drank water from stagnant pools and invoked the spirits when they fell ill. What is important about the Minister of Health's verdict is the way in which dual sites of problematisation are bracketed out. On the one hand, backwardness refers to a battered health infrastructure which had been made all the worse by decades of war and colonial neglect, especially in rural areas where healthcare provision was rudimentary, if at all existent. But the Minister was also arguing that a part of the health problem in Vietnam was what he saw as a 'backwardness of our people' which perpetuated unhealthy practices - "people had the habit of relieving themselves in any place they found convenient" and were "drinking water from the pool where he also washes his rice and vegetables" (ibid. : 6). In other words, this was an ethical form of backwardness that was to be addressed and improved through a kind of 'civilising process', which included "education in cleanliness" and "persuading people to drink only boiled water, building septic tanks, killing flies and other insects" (ibid.). Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, outmoded (hu tuc) or negative (tieu cuc) traditions (often connected with spiritualism, sorcery and fortune telling) have been targeted for elimination by the government, in contrast to good (tot nep) and wholesome (lanh manh) traditions (truyen thong), including traditional medicine, which have been actively promoted and encouraged (Taylor 2004: 37-56). Today, some fifty years since the revitalisation effort began, health authorities continue to distinguish between "backward" and "good" traditions, arguing that "people at the village and commune levels, especially those residing in areas where the basic health system remains weak, typically go to non-professional people (e.g. friends, neighbours, relatives, those who incur the same disease) when getting ill, or they even seek the services of charlatans, sorcerers, magicians, etc." (Vietnam. Ministry of Health 2006). As such, basic 213 health and hygiene education as well as awareness-raising about 'bad' or 'unhealthy' traditions continue to be a priority of official health programmes in many rural areas of the country.128 It is in this kind of self-care education and health promotion that traditional herbal medicine has come to take on a renewed and very practical importance in recent decades. As we saw earlier, a consistent part of Vietnam's postcolonial herbal medicine revitalisation effort has been to "mobilize, encourage and guide people in [the] planting, raising and use of plants and animals as materia medica" (Vietnam. Ministry of Health 2006). In such rural programmes, the family is considered the most important unit responsible for promoting the health of individuals, a view also captured in the popular Vietnamese phrase Tu than, te gia (improve yourself, manage your family) (Craig 2002: 50). It is these families that are to be encouraged to grow their own medicinal plant gardens, and it is within each of these families that a 'doctor at home' is to be groomed. It is also these families that have long formed the locus of medical treatment, with especially mothers playing a central role in memorising family remedies, discussing and exchanging experiences with neighbours and friends, and also in preparing remedies in the home. Now, in the past couple of decades or so, with the implementation of a series of economic reforms starting in 1986,129 the gradual lifting of trade embargos against Vietnam and the development of a national pharmaceutical industry, cheap generic modern medicines (especially antibiotics) have joined traditional remedies as an important part of household medicine and treatment. Moreover, as noted in chapter 4, these developments also led to a situation where a considerable number of traditional practitioners abandoned their practices following the loss of subsidies that they had previously received from the government. It was against this background that the latest of revitalisation pushes was put in motion by the Ministry of Health in the early 1990s, with the launching of the 'Doctor at Home' and 'Drugs at Home' programmes, as well as the development of a national traditional medicine strategy (see chapter 4). 128 In this sense, there are clear continuities with colonial problematisations of 'superstitious' and 'backward' natives (see chapter 3). However, such problematisations have been redistributed within Vietnam, such that especially more rural population groups and ethnic communities are considered more prone to 'backwardness' than, say, the urban populations of Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City. 129 Known as the doi moi (renovation) reforms. 214 Whereas some of the first postcolonial efforts to revitalise traditional medicine were described in terms of 'civilising' and 'emancipating' initiatives, it is interesting to note how this latest of active efforts to promote traditional medicine has come to be cast. As Taylor has shown, the 1990s in Vietnam was marked by a "turn to culture" as Vietnamese authorities commissioned ethnologists and folklorists to catalogue the country's ethnic and cultural diversity, published numerous books on Vietnamese identity, and prepared guides to traditional festivals and folk beliefs - not in the least as a means of "provid[ing] cultural moorings, equilibrium, and spiritual solace to a country... that is embarked on a course of rapid and disorienting cultural, social and economic transformation" (2004: 44, 91). It was during this time that traditional medicine in Vietnam came to be consistently referred to as "Vietnamese traditional medicine" as opposed to a generic 'traditional medicine', not least as a way to distinguish it from Chinese medicine: far from being merely a copy of Chinese traditional medicine... Vietnamese traditional medicine is made up of ancient health care practices related to the Vietnamese culture. (Hoang, et al. 1999) The point being that, as Vietnam increasingly opened itself to globalising influences during the course of the 1990s, Vietnamese subjects were seen as having to negotiate their way through a plurality of forms of healing advice and medicaments. By the end of the 20th century, antibiotics had become as common as traditional herbal remedies in day-to-day family health practices. And while welcomed as an indicator of increasing modernisation and economic growth by health authorities in Vietnam, this situation of a largely unregulated medical plurality came to be seen as a public health concern in itself, especially as pertained a range of safety issues arising from the "irrational use" of modern medicines (see Craig 2002; Okumura, et al. 2002). There are two sides to these concerns over public health. Interestingly, on the one hand, it is a situation not unlike that resulting from over-the-counter sales of herbal remedies in the United Kingdom where, because of a relative lack of regulatory controls, herbal medicine users are urged to be vigilant and to do some basic research into the quality of products before purchasing anything. In a very similar fashion, public health campaigns in Vietnam have begun urging users of over-the-counter modern medicines to be vigilant of counterfeit and bad quality products, a task that many have already taken on board based on bad 215 personal experiences (Craig 2002; Vietnam. Standing Committee of National Assembly. 2003). On the other hand, as modern medicines have become increasingly available and entered household health practices, it seems that their efficacy has come to be, in a kind of reverse 'colonisation', explained in terms of the humoral and vitalistic theories of traditional Vietnamese medicine rather than the germ, cell or gene theories of modern medicine. As Craig (2000) has shown, modern medicines are considered 'hot' (nhiet), 'heavy' (nang) and 'strong' (suc) medicines, and users often shop around to find a 'suitable' medicine - not only according to the condition that is to be treated but also to find a medicine that is 'compatible' with or 'familiar' to the individual using it. This 'cognitive colonisation' of modern medicines, it is argued, has contributed to "irrational use" understood in terms of harmful polypharmacy (e.g. mixing of many different antibiotics) or inappropriate dosages (most often much too short treatment courses) which are increasingly being tackled as public health problems, especially as they are seen as contributing to the building up of antibiotics-resistant bacteria (Craig 2002; Okumura, et al. 2002). Vice Minister of Health Le Van Truyen argues that "it is necessary to prevent and address negative effects caused by unsafe and irrational drug use such as shorter courses than required, overdose, misuse of drugs, wrong combination of different types of drugs, drug abuse" by providing the public with "instructions for rational and safe use of drugs" (Vietnam. Ministry of Health 2006). And so, just as one finds Sino-Vietnamese notions of hot and cold or wind and damp organising health promoting practices of the self, so too can one find biomedical concepts of germs, contagion and infection circulating in various forms of household advice that encourage healthy living on a day-to-day basis. Interestingly, it is exactly this multiplicity of rationalities - a side effect of colonisation and globalisation - that has recently come to be problematised in itself. Taylor and Craig argue that "Vietnamese leaders in the 1990s were increasingly prone to take a functionalist approach to culture [reflecting] a strong feeling that Vietnam would need to fight to preserve its traditions, national essence, and distinctive psychology against the depredations of global culture" (2004: 56), not least in the field of medicine where: Vietnam's experience of trying to harmonize Eastern and Western medicines shows [that] the two rationalities are so radically different at the 216 levels of epistemology, organizing metaphor, and clinical approach that relations are more of an unbalanced contest and a partial appropriation than a synthesis... The conflicting authorities of tradition and modernity, mothers and grandmothers, self, household, and medical professional means that antibiotic consumers must negotiate a plurality of conflicting notions, locations, and positions about what constitutes 'correct'. And as the sources of biomedical authority grease their prescriptions with commerce, the most locally important basis for knowing what is correct begins to slip away. The regularities of the body and the commodity run headlong into the cultural confusion of competing claims, values, and maxims of local and global rationalities. Not surprisingly, people get their stability where they can.
