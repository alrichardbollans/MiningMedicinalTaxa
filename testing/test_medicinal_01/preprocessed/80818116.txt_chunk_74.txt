6-MAM was not detected in any available biological sam-ple from the three forensic cases, thus further analysis is needed to determine the origin of the opiates. Even though MOR is an end product of HER metabolism, it can also be a metabolite of COD, which is an active substance in some formulations. Some studies have compared MOR/COD concentration ratio, suggesting that MOR/COD concentra-tion ratio >1 indicates HER use (Bogusz et al., 2001; Ceder and Jones, 2001; Konstantinova et al., 2012). Other stud-ies suggest the use of acetylcodeine (AC), a by-product of HER synthesis, as a marker of illicit HER use. AC is con-sidered as the only definite marker of illicit HER use, along with 6-MAM, but its short half-life aggravates its useful-ness in forensic applications (Bogusz et al., 2001; Gold-berger et al., 1994; Musshoff et al., 2010). This is also con-firmed by the results of our study, where AC was not de-tected in any death case. Though some authors propose the presence of papaverine, especially its metabolites as a re-liable marker of HER use, several studies have shown that papaverine metabolites can be detected in urine after the consumption of poppy seeds (Musshoff et al., 2010; Pa-terson and Cordero, 2006). COD and noscapine (and its metabolites meconin and cotarnine) are also considered as markers of HER use (Bogusz et al., 2001; Paterson and Cordero, 2006). However, they can also be detected in bio-logical samples after food consumption as papaverine (Bo-gusz et al., 2001; Musshoff et al., 2010; Paterson and Cor-dero, 2006). In our cases, almost all opium alkaloids were identified, but 6-MAM was not detected. Pharmaceutically prepared HER is not available as a treatment option in Re-public of Macedonia, therefore it can be concluded that the deceased had used illicit HER. ConclusionThe absence of 6-MAM in postmortem biological samples is not an indicator of HER non-use. When inter-preting the results for the opiate presence due to the use of HER or different opioids, the results of numerous research-es can be utilized, such as MOR/COD ratio as the most rel-evant marker or the presence of AC as a definite marker of HER use. The determination of other opioid alkaloids such as papaverine, noscapine and its metabolites, togeth-er with additional forensic evidences can be useful in au-topsy cases.ReferencesBogusz, M.J., Maier, R.D., Erkens, M., Kohls, U., 2001.

Macedonia* bujaroska_m@yahoo.comIntroductionOpioid dependence is a complex socio-medical state and a serious problem for the society, linked with a high morbidity and mortality rate (WHO, 2004). Even though several pharmacological agents are available, in the Re-public of Macedonia, the maintenance therapy includes methadone (METH) and buprenorphine, with METH be-ing the first agent used in the opioid substitution treatment (OST) and it still remains the main prescribed medication (EMCDDA, 2013). There are indications that alongside with the general decrease in drug seizures between 2009 and 2012 in Republic of Macedonia, there was some short-age in supply, encouraging users to replace heroin with other substances such as METH, benzodiazepines (BZDs) and tramadol (EMCDDA, 2013). Despite the prescription of BZDs for therapeutic purposes, the prevalence of their misuse among OST patients is reported to be high in oth-er countries and is related to severe consequences such as non-fatal and fatal overdoses (EMCDDA, 2015).The aim of this report is to assess the number and nature of drug-related deaths (DRDs) in the Republic of Macedo-nia over the period 2011-2015, with the emphasis on death cases involving positive findings for METH and BZDs.Materials and methodsAll toxicological analyses from autopsies performed at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Skopje during a 5-year-period were reviewed. Postmortem toxicological analysis of blood and urine samples was conducted using biochip array technology and fluorescence polarization im-munoassay, respectively. Whenever possible, the positive results from the screening were confirmed by gas chro-matography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), after previous sample preparation by ion-exchange solid-phase extrac-tion (SPE). Acid hydrolysis was performed prior to SPE for the urine samples showing positive results for BZDs tested with screening methods. The concentration of etha-nol in the samples was determined by headspace gas chro-matography-flame ionization detection.Results and discussionThe postmortem toxicological analyses were per-formed on a total of 1251 cases in the 5 year period be-ing reviewed. A total of 89 cases showed positive results for drugs of abuse, whereas combined use of psychoactive substances was noticed in 57 cases (64.05% of all DRDs). Concomitant use of METH and BZDs was implicated in 39 DRDs over the time period studied (43.82% of the to-tal DRDs), with the highest number of fatalities involving their combined use in 2013 (14 cases). The percentage of METH and BZDs DRDs gradually increases starting from 2011, with the highest peak seen in 2012 and 2013 (50% of all DRDs). After that, the percentage declines in 2014, reaching the same level as in 2011. A rise in the trend of DRDs is seen again in 2015. No information on the possi-ble involvement of deceased in OST was available. In all cases analyzed by GC-MS diazepam was the only BZD identified. The presence of ethanol was detected in only 9 cases of all studied DRDs. Other substances (cannabi-S3 PP 149318Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 317 - 318 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsnoids, cocaine, tricyclic antidepressants and opiates) were detected in addition to the combination of METH and BZDs in 16 cases.The number of deaths in which METH is either the cause of death or a positive toxicological finding has sig-nificantly increased (Mijatovic at al., 2014). In some stud-ies it has been reported that alcohol and BZDs are most commonly detected concomitants together with METH (Laberke and Bartsch, 2010; Mijatovic at al., 2014). None-theless, regarding alcohol presence, this was not confirmed in this report where ethanol was detected in only 9 cases of all DRDs. Concomitant use of METH and BZDs was im-plicated in 43.82% of the total DRDs, with diazepam being the only BZD identified in all analyzed cases by GC-MS, similar to other studies (Iwersen-Bergmann at al., 2014; Mijatovic at al. 2014). Furthermore, this correlates with the data from EMCDDA stating that BZDs with a more rapid onset of action (diazepam, alprazolam) appear to be more frequently used by opioid users than those with a slower onset (EMCDDA, 2015). Much of the BZDs mis-use consists of self-medication for treatment of psychiat-ric and mood disorders, alleviation of withdrawal symp-toms and increase of the rewarding and reinforcing effects of the opioids (Eiroa-Orosa at al., 2010; EMCDDA, 2015).The potential for significant morbidity and mortality with METH, either alone or in combination with BZDs, is widely reported (Lee at al., 2014). METH's inhibitory ef-fect on the brain's respiratory center can lead to respirato-ry depression, hypoventilation and pulmonary edema (Ber-nard, 2013). It is suggested that u-opioid agonists suppress respiration by acting on the respiratory centers in the brain-stem, decreasing the ventilatory response to CO2 (Pattin-son, 2008). In this way, the inspiration is prolonged, while changes in tidal volume can be observed at higher opioid doses (Lalley, 2003) The concurrent use of opioids with BZDs and other central nervous system depressants is con-sidered to be an important element in the mechanism of death (Bernard, 2013). Some authors suggest that BZDs compete with METH for u-opioid receptors, resulting in higher concentrations of METH in acute intoxications with METH and BZDs, while in chronic abuse situations, BZDs inhibit hepatic enzymes that metabolize METH, also lead-ing to increased METH concentrations (Mikolaenko at al., 2002). Moreover, it had been postulated that BZDs may also have effects on signal transduction and second mes-senger systems involved with u-opioid receptor regulation (Poisnel at al., 2009). Other possibly fatal METH-relat-ed effects in the body, such as pulmonary oedema and ar-rhythmias secondary to QT-interval prolongation must be also borne in mind (Bernard, 2013). The high frequency of positive findings on METH and BZDs in postmortem analysis of DRDs implies possi-ble METH diversion and widespread availability of BZDs among METH users. ConclusionIt is complicated to establish the role of BZDs in DRDs and their misuse has been shown to contribute to morbidi-ty and mortality rate among METH users. Much still needs to be done regarding the monitoring of METH and educat-ing the patients involved in OST about the risks associated with multiple drug use.ReferencesBernard, J.P., Havnes, I., Slordal, L., Waal, H., Morland, J., Khiabani, H.Z., 2013.
