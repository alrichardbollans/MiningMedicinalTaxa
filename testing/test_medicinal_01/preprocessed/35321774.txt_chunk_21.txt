ANOVA test wasdone and determination coefficients of 0.9764 and 0.9318 for k and Srespectively, signified a good correlation among results.The next step was method optimization by Derringer's desirabilityfunction. This function is defined as the geometric mean, sometimesweighted, of the individual desirability functions [2]. The equation 1defines Derringer's desirability function:where D is the value of the global desirability function, di is the partialdesirability function for each of the n responses and ri is the relativeimportance assigned to the response i. Relative importance ri is acomparative scale for weighting each of the resulting di in the overalldesirability product and it varies from the least important (ri = 1) to themost important (ri = 5). The characteristics of a goal may be altered byadjusting the importance or weight. Weights lower than 1 give less em-phasis to the goal, whereas weights greater than 1 give more empha-sis to the goal. In both cases, di varies in a non-linear way whileapproaching the desired value, while with a weight of 1 di varies in alinear way [2]. A value of D close to 1 implies the combination of thedifferent criteria is globally optimal, so that the response values arenear defined target values.In the present report the goal was to obtain the target value for kBI-II786 BS set at 5 with the lower and upper bound 3 and 7, respectively.The weights were set to 1 on the both sides. For the S P/2-ABT thegoal was maximization in the range from 0 to 0.1, while the weight wasadjusted to 1. The importance was set to 3 for both responses. Fol-lowing the conditions and restrictions above, the optimization proce-dure was carried out. The predicted optimum was: 0.7% w/w butylacetate, 1.0% w/w sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2% w/w Brij 35(r), 7.6%w/w n-butanol and 0.75% w/w triethylamine. The corresponding globaldesirability D was 1. The predicted response values (5 for kBI-II 786 BSand 0.28 for S P/2-ABT) were confirmed experimentally. The observeddifference between the predicted and experimental responses is foundto be in good agreement and well within the acceptance limits at 95% confidence interval. Desirability-based optimization proved to be a valuable approach inoptimizing parameters controlling separation in the proposed MELCmethod. It was confirmed that the appropriate selection of experi-mental design and optimization approach ensure the provision ofmany useful information in the most efficient and reliable way.REFERENCES1.

Having chemically completely different structures,their chromatographic separation demands an attentive approach. Tofulfill all the requirements for an optimal chromatographic run, theexperimental design was employed. In order to define factors whichshould be investigated through the experimental design, careful pre-liminary study was conducted. As factors to be followed during theoptimization, the content of acetonitrile in the mobile phase, pH ofthe mobile phase and the concentration of potassium-dihydrogen-phosphate were chosen. All other factors (column: Thermo Hypersilgold C18 4.6 x 100 mm, 5 mm particle size, flow rate: 1 ml min.-1, tem-perature: 30 degC and wavelength 210 nm) were kept on defined levels.Chromatographic separation was done on the chromatographic systemWaters Breeze consisted of Waters 1525 Binary HPLC Pump, Waters 2487UV/VIS detector and Breeze Software, Windows XP, for data collection. For the optimization, central composite design (CCD) was chosen. The CCDis built of the full factorial 2k design and star design [1, 2]. Finally, the CCD iscompleted by the addition of the central point. The total number of exper-iments N for 3 investigated factors is 18, where four experiments presentreplications. Mathematical relationship between inputs (for three factors)and outputs is presented as the second order polynomial model. As outputs,retention factors for active substances and selectivity factor were chosen. Significance of appropriate factor was estimated according to p-value.If p<0.0500, the influence of certain factor is significant, and viceversa. Thus, the retention behavior of both substances is under strongacentonitrile influence. Further, on the retention of hydrochloroth-iazide, the concentration of potassium-dihydrogenphosphate was in-fluential. Finally, on the retention between two substances,acetonitrile had the strongest influence as well as the interaction oftwo factors - pH and the concentration of potassium-dihydrogen-phosphate. Also, ANOVA test was done and correlation coefficienthigher than 0.9856 for all the outputs showed a good correlationamong results. A good adequacy of the model was confirmed by Fvalue. In the end, 3D graphs of the most influential factors on all threeoutputs were constructed. On the basis of the obtained results, the optimal chromatographicconditions were set: 36 % of acetonitrile in the mobile phase, pH of themobile phase 3.5 and the concentration of potassium-dihydrogen-phosphate 20 mmol L-1. It could be concluded that CCD was useful forthe method development and evaluation. 46Makedonski farmatsevtski bilten 57 (dodatok), 2011FARMATsEVTSKI ANALIZI / OBEZBEDUVANjE KVALITET / REGULATIVA poster prezentatsiiPETTI KONGRES NA FARMATsIJATA SO MEGjUNARODNO UChESTVOREFERENCES1.

High-performance, Li-quid Chromatography, Mass spectrometry, polarimetry and NMRspectroscopy, are used for determining taxifolin from Bark of PinusContorta [1]. On the second hand, there are a numerous articles, andPharmacopoeiaes [2,3] with various methods for determining vitaminC. Our aim was to develop two methods (UV-Vis and HPLC with Uv-Visdetector) for simultaneous analisys of the taxifolin and vitamin C incapsules. Therefore, we are foccussed only on articles presenting ana-lysis of vitamin C used HPLC, with UV or DAD. The assays on vitaminC, given in articles, included food derivatives, juices, multivitamin pre-parations and different beverages [4,5,6,7,]. MATERIALS AND METHODSTaxifolin (dihydroqurcetin) used as the working standard, manufac-tured by Ametis, Vitamin C used as the working standard, manufac-tured by Shadong luwei pharmaceutical, ethanol HPLC grade(J.T.Baker, U.S.A.), Hydrochloric acid p.a. (Fisher Scientific), MethanolHPLC grade (J.T.Baker, U.S.A.), orto-phosphoric acid 85% (Merck) andwater HPLC grade. Ketrix(r) capsulles was manufactured by Phar-manova d.o.o. Obrenovac. UV/VIS analysis was carried out on Lambda 16 Uv/VisSpectrophotometar (Perkin - Elmer, USA). The apsorbance of thestandard, sample and blank solutions were measured after derivatiza-ton at 295.74 nm for taxifolin, and at 276.42 for vitamin C. using 10mmquartz cells. UPLC analyses was performed on Acquity UPLC system (Waters, USA)equipped with Binary Sovent Manager, Sample Manager, columncompartment and PDA detector. Separations were made on WatersAcquity UPLC BEH C18 column (50 mm L x 2.1 mm i.d., 1.7 mm particalsize). Data aquisition was performed using Empower software. Theanalysis was performed at flow rate 0.4 ml/min, the detector wave-length was at 270 nm for vitamin C and at 290 nm for taxifolin. Thecolumn temperature was ambient and the injection volume was 1 ml.Gradient elution was used for separation. Sample and standard preparationThe sample was prepared as follows for Uv/Vis analysis: 0.10g of pow-der obtained from 20 capsules was transferred into a 20.0 mlvolumetric flask, added 2.0 ml 0,1M hydrochloric acid and dilluted with70% ethanol V/V to the mark. 1.0 ml of this solution is transferred intoa 50.0 ml calibrated flask and dissolved to the mark with mixture of0,1M HCL and 70% ethanol V/V (1:9). Standard stock solution of taxi-folin and vitamin C for Uv/Vis ( in mixture 0,1M HCl and 70% ethanolV/V (1:9)), was used for preparing the series solutions. Those solutionscontaining taxifolin and vitamin C of 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, 12.0, and 14.0mg/ml were used for preparing the calibration curve.Sample preparation for the UPLC analysis: 0.10g of powder obtainedfrom 20 capsules was transferred into a 20.0 ml volumetric flask, add2.0 ml 0,1M hydrochloric acid and dilluted with ethanol HPLC gradeto the mark. The solution was filtered throught 0,45 mm membran filterto a vial. Standard stock solution of taxifolin and vitamin C for UPLCanalysis (in mixture 0,1M HCL and 70% ethanol V/V (1:9)) was used forpreparing the series solutions. Those solutions containing taxifolin andvitamin C in concentration of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.7 mg/ml wereused for preparing the calibration curve. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe proposed Uv/Vis and UPLC assays for the determination of taxi-folin and vitamin C were validated for linearity, selectivity, accuracyand precision (repeatability). The calibration curves were establishedas dependance of absorbance/peak area on the taxifolin and vitaminC concentration. The Uv/Vis method was shown to be linear over theconcentration range 6.0-14.0 mg/ml. The regression equations were:y = 0.0032 + 0.0174, with correlation coefficient r = 0.9999 for taxi-folin and y = 0.0032 + 0.0174, with correlation coefficient r = 0.9997for vitamin C, indicating good linearity. In the case of UPLC, linearresponse was over the concentration range 0.3-0.7 mg/ml. Over thisconcentration range, linear regression analysis of peak areas (y)versus concentrations (x) yielded the equations y = 8065779x+113037.7 with r = 0.9998 for taxifolin and y = 1178594x + 10086.71for vitamin C with r = 0.9999 which improve good linearity.Selectivity of the methods was checked by observing if there wasany interference from the excipients from capsules. Retention timesof 0.4 min for vitamin C, and 0.9 min for taxifolin, showed, that theUPLC method can analyze both vitamin C and taxifolin in capsulesin a very short time. The results obtained for assay precision, with sixdifferent concentrations of taxifolin and vitamin C, in two days, hasshown RSD bellow 1.5 % for both methods. The accuracy of bothmethods were proven by determination of the taxifolin and vitaminC in laboratory, prepared dosage formulations containing deffinedquantities of the active substances (80, 100 and 120% levels of labelclaim). The recoveries obtained in Uv/Vis method varied from 99.99-102.76% for taxifolin, 97.69 -103.0% for vitamin C, and recoveries ob-tained in UPLC method are from 100.35 - 102.93% for taxifolin and99.52 - 102.32% for vitamin C . All these results have shown that there is no significant difference indetermining the content taxifolin and vitamin C using both tech-niques. REFERENCES1. H.Outtrup, K. Schaumbrg, Carlsberg Res.
