We saw how traditional healers are invariably omitted from ongoing efforts to combine traditional and modern medicine in Vietnam, and in the UK those forms of therapy found in group 3 of the House of Lords Select Committee's CAM hierarchy, such as crystallography or radionics, continue to be excluded from state-sanctioned regulatory initiatives on the grounds of 'backward' or 'unverified' healing practices. Indeed, the active hierarchisation of TM and CAM therapies in both countries has been an important feature of the internalisation of dividing practices that I have described in this chapter. 86 Nevertheless, to the extent that TM and CAM therapies are being mobilised in Vietnam and the UK, what I have argued in this chapter is that this has been made possible by making TM and CAM practitioner subjectivities amenable to technical public health interventions. While a practitioner may in the past have been a quack for the mere fact of practicing or even associating with a non-biomedical therapy, today's quack is more one who is deemed to be practicing medicine (whether traditional, complementary, alternative or modern) irresponsibly, incompetently or unscrupulously to the detriment of public health. Yet, if this transformation has opened up a space for a number of TM and CAM therapies in Vietnamese and British national health delivery, it has also unavoidably produced a number of dividing practices within these various forms of therapy. In both countries, this ongoing process of formalisation has been the subject of vociferous contestation and debate concerning how best to manage and organise it, which is perhaps not too surprising since practitioners of TM and CAM, who have in the past undoubtedly shared a certain sense of solidarity (in the face of discriminatory state-sanctioned or colonial biomedical monopolies), are increasingly being called upon to distinguish the competent from the incompetent as well as the responsible from the unscrupulous amongst their own ranks. I will now turn my attention to how the production, practice and use of indigenous traditional herbal medicine in Vietnam and the UK have in recent decades come to be normalised in the ways identified here. 87 4 Bio-politics and the normalisation of herbal medicine It is perhaps the herbalist who best exemplifies the kind of continued ambivalence that many alternative and traditional practitioners face today.40 On the one hand, herbalists are revered for their long-founded experience, astute study of the medicinal properties of plants, and considerable contributions to national pharmacopoeias, not least in Vietnam. In the United Kingdom, they are often highlighted for their caring, 'whole person' patient consultations and the herbal medicines they use are described as just about the safest there are, sparing patients from the brutal and toxic side-effects so common in modern pharmaceutical treatment. This is certainly the case with both St. John's Wort and Heantos, which are advocated as low side-effect and more holistic alternatives to the pharmaceutical anti-depressants and 'western' addiction treatment methods otherwise in wide use. 'Natural' by their very vegetable nature, herbal remedies are claimed to be more gentle and agreeable to patients as they go about revitalising the body's own vis medicatrix naturae, re-establishing balance and restoring health. In Vietnam, it is argued that traditional medicine, which consists primarily of herbal medicine though often coupled with acupuncture, massage, meditation and various exercise techniques, "offers incontestable advantages [over modern medicine] because it is gentler, less aggressive and less toxic" (Bui 1999: 30). This sentiment is shared in the United Kingdom where herbalists suggest that their medicine is "a kinder alternative to mainstream medicine [providing] a safe, gentle and effective approach to health care" (NIMH 2004b). Yet, on the other hand, herbalists have just as often been rebuked for lack of safety and quality controls, and for holding on to 'superstitions' or 'old wives' tales' in their diagnostic and prescribing practices. In a 1983 report on adverse reactions to herbal medicines, the United Kingdom's Department of Health complained that, for all the potential health benefits herbal medicines may hold, "the medical herbalist is at fault for clinging to outworn historical authority and for not assessing his drugs in terms of today's knowledge" (cited in British Medical Association. Board of Science and Education. 1986: 40 Sections in this chapter concerning Vietnam have been published as "Bio-politics and the promotion of traditional herbal medicine in Vietnam" (Wahlberg 2006). 88 110). And in Vietnam, while the many rural herbalists who have learned their trade through apprenticeships are without doubt valued for the "treasury of knowledge" they represent, they are also slated for their jealous guarding of "secret" family remedies that are "frequently laden with sorcery and magical practices which conceal a very simple reality and can lead scientists in wrong directions in their research" (Bui 1999: 35). What is more, the very 'naturalness' of herbal remedies has in recent years been challenged by an increasing number of herbal product recalls by health authorities on the grounds of reported adverse effects due to heavy metal contamination or traces of undeclared synthetic medicines. It is exactly this paradox - of the gentle yet potentially dangerous 'natural' medicine - that constitutes today's herbal problem. And if we indeed have witnessed a change in public health protection strategies from marginalising to normalising alternative and traditional medicines as I have suggested, then it seems more than plausible to understand what has been happening in the field of herbal medicine over the past few decades in terms of attempts to reconcile this ambivalence. Take, for example, a recent set of WHO guidelines on the "proper use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine" in which they argue that: many consumers have turned to natural traditional medicinal products and practices, under the assumption that 'natural means safe'. However, this is not necessarily the case. A number of reports have revealed examples of incorrect use of traditional medicines by consumers, including incidents of overdose, unknowing use of suspect or counterfeit herbal medicines, and unintentional injuries caused by unqualified practitioners. (WHO 2004a: ix, my emphasis) While it is certainly clear that both Vietnamese and British traditional herbal medicine have their roots in ancient practices and traditions, we will see in this chapter how it is equally clear that in recent times herbal medicine has come to be appropriated as an object of expert scientific knowledge, which has allowed for it to be recruited as a possible solution to very specific and targeted problems of morbidity and ill health. Nevertheless, traditional herbal medicine remains a public health problem today inasmuch as inconsistencies in terms of product safety, practitioner training and consumer information are seen as deterring rather than promoting public health. 89 What follows here is a tracing out of a problematisation, an account of how the counterfeit and contaminated products, the unqualified and unregistered practitioners, as well as the unaware and uneducated patients of herbal medicine have come to be seen as public health problems in a Vietnamese, British and also supranational (the WHO and EU specifically) context over the past half-century or so. As such this chapter should not be read as an exhaustive history of the regulation of herbal medicine in these two countries, but rather as a demonstration of how the building up of expert bodies of knowledge about the most "effective", "safe", and "proper" ways of using, producing and practicing traditional herbal medicine has been a requisite part of its recruitment in service of public health in both rural and urban areas. Moreover, this chapter will also show how recent problematisations of the potential dangers of herbal medicine are being played out in very concrete terms, including a range of remedial actions to make the practice and use of traditional herbal medicine compatible with bio-political goals of safeguarding and promoting the public health of British and Vietnamese populations. It is this bio-politicisation of herbal medicine that I will argue has allowed for its 20th century transformation from public health liability into public health resource (at least potentially so) in both countries, albeit with markedly different outcomes. From herbals to pharmacopoeias If there is one thing that is agreed upon in an otherwise contested field of herbal medicine, it is that peoples and cultures all over the world have been using plants to treat their ailments for a very long time - the proverbial roots of medicine. Moreover, with most contemporary estimates suggesting that the vast majority of the global population continues to rely on herbs for medicinal needs, the pigeonholing of herbal medicines as 'alternative' in many western countries is often smirked at by its proponents. Yet herbal medicines for the most part remain 'alternative' or 'traditional' as opposed to 'modern' or 'pharmaceutical', even if the industrialisation of healing herbs into what are now commonly referred to as "herbal medicinal products" has increasingly blurred this distinction. And whether in the form of its original starting material (fresh, dried or comminuted leaves, stems, flower buds or bark) or as industrially-produced capsules, tonics or tablets, herbal medicines that are sold for health-related purposes and/or make health-related curative claims have increasingly become subject to safety and standardisation requirements, as a means to assure users and to protect them from the potential dangers that 90 are both inherent to the 'natural' herbs but also augmented by industrial production practices. So, what has characterised the push to normalise herbal medicines over the past decades? To begin with, it has required a comprehensive mapping out exercise of botanical enlightenment, designed to put order into the rich yet sometimes chaotic, unsystematic, unscientific and even unwritten records of medicinal herbs that have been used for centuries. In Vietnam, this exercise, which is very much ongoing, began around 1961 with the establishment of the national Institute of Materia Medica, whose task it became to "moderniz[e]... various types of traditional medical formulations" (Vietnam. Institute of Materia Medica. 2004). The key challenges facing the institute's scientists were firstly, that while the experience of the hundreds and thousands of traditional practitioners around Vietnam was invaluable to them, it was often recorded only sporadically and when done, names of plants were given in their vernacular forms which varied from region to region and ethnic group to ethnic group. Moreover, correct harvesting information (which has significant bearing on a herb's medicinal potency) was rarely sufficiently noted. And finally, some herbal remedies were nowhere to be found in the otherwise rich archive of Vietnamese herbal records dating back to Tue Tinh's 14th century classic on The Miraculous Medicine of the Southern Country41 and Lan Ong's 18th century Treatise on Medical Knowledge Accumulated by Hai Thuong, having been "handed down in family circles from father to son, from mother to daughter, [with] secrets... always strictly preserved, particularly among some ethnic minorities" (Bui 1999: 35). As summarised by Hoang et al. : "Under the ancient regime, there was never an official pharmacopoeia for traditional medicine. Medical formulas, uncontrolled, developed in a spontaneous and empirical way" (1999: 27). Faced with these particular challenges, a strategy unique to the Vietnamese setting was devised, at the heart of which were numerous scientific parties that were sent out on botanizing missions "throughout the country, interviewing traditional practitioners and collecting from the elderly many long-forgotten remedies" (Nguyen 1999: 38). Pharmacist do Tat Loi's six-volume series on the Medicinal Plants of Vietnam and their Biochemical Properties (2001), the result of countless journeys and conversations with traditional 41 'Southern' here is in relation to China. 91 practitioners over a 20-year period starting in 1954, has become a classic of this project, complete with botanical classifications and detailed descriptions of their medicinal uses. The Institute of Materia Medica has also been instrumental in this task, collecting over 8,000 samples, from which 1,850 species have been catalogued according to their vernacular names, scientific names and pharmacological properties (Nguyen 1999: 38). Moreover, the medicinal use of parts of 403 animal species and of 70 minerals have also been recorded by the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources (Vietnam Economy 2003a). The pioneer efforts of these many scientists and traditional practitioners were central in ensuring a place for herbal remedies and starting materials in the Vietnamese Pharmacopoeia, which consists of two codex, one for modern medicines (published by the Ministry of Health for the first time in 1971) and one for traditional herbal medicines (published for the first time in 1976). Moreover, building on four decades of botanical research, the Insitute of Materia Medica has "been able to draw up a distribution map of medicinal plants in Vietnam, with approximate estimates of natural reserves" (Nguyen 1999: 38). Like Vietnam, the United Kingdom is home to a rich archive of books describing plants and their medicinal properties (known as 'herbals') which can be found scattered throughout the past centuries of publishing history, from John Gerard's Herball or General Historie of Plantes (1597), Nicholas Culpeper's The English Physitian (1652), Elizabeth Blackwell's A Curious Herbal (1739), William Withering's A Botanical Arrangement of all the Vegetables naturally growing in Great Britain (1776), Robert John Thornton's A Family Herbal (1814), to Albert Isaiah Coffin's A Botanic Guide to Health and the Natural Pathology of Disease (1852). The result of meticulous study by their authors, these oft-reprinted books and many other similar herbals have been instrumental in the subsequent botanical identification, classification and description of medicinally used British plant species. Yet, it was these very books that would end up banished to the fringes of medicine by the end of the 19th century, rejected by a growing medical profession as nothing more than collections of old wives' tales that still relied on the doctrine of signatures or astrology for explanations of efficacy. And although the synthetic drugs of modern medicine were ironically enough often developed through the isolation, structure elucidation and chemical transformation of single active compounds found in plants, medical doctors were quick to 92 contrast their 'purified' medicines with the 'messy' or 'impure' remedies of herbalists as part of their marginalising strategies.42 At any rate, it was precisely to counter such charges that herbalists set about publishing a series of updated reference books in the early part of the 20th century. In 1905 the National Association of Medical Herbalists published the first National Botanic Pharmacopoeia. A few years later, in 1920, Mathew Robinson published The New Family Herbal, underlining that any notion of "the government of Herbs by the sun, moon and planets, has been exploded by modern science; and is now regarded by persons of ordinary capacity to be absurd in the extreme" (cited in Brown 1985: 81). And in 1931, Maud Grieve and Hilda Leyel published what they called A Modern Herbal, arguing that "[a]ll serious Herbalists have long realized that a new Herbal is badly needed - a herbal which must include the traditional lore and properties of plants, and the modern use of properly standardized extracts and tinctures which were unknown in the days of Gerard and Parkinson, and even in the days of Culpeper, and which have been made possible by the development of modern chemistry" (Grieve and Leyel 1931, my emphasis). These updated reference books covering more than 800 herbs - listed according to botanical name, botanical family, synonyms, parts used, botanical description, constituents, indications, medicinal action, medicinal uses, preparation and dosage - marked important steps in the transformation of the long-standing 'herbal' into a monograph-based pharmacopoeia of herbs and herbal remedies. It would not, however, be until 1965 that efforts to prepare the current British Herbal Pharmacopoeia began. As Griggs has shown, during the drafting of what would become the 1968 Medicines Act, the British Herbal Medicine Association (an interest group of herbalists, manufacturers and retailers formed in 1964) had been informed that "a herb for which a monograph appeared in any standard reference book and was not poisonous" might be exempted from the kind of safety and efficacy evidence requirements that were a precondition for pharmaceutical medicines seeking market authorisation (Griggs 1997: 282). In response, the BHMA quickly put together a Scientific Committee in 1965 made up of pharmacologists, botanists, pharmacists and physicians, who were set the task of bringing order to the rich, yet dispersed and sometimes outdated, information that was available from the various herbals, 42 See Griggs (1997) for a comprehensive account of the history of herbal medicine in the United Kingdom and other 'western' countries in which these marginalising strategies are accounted for in detail. 93 as well as other sources of literature on the safety, efficacy and also quality of various medicinal plants.43 While this committee did not set out on the kind of extensive field expeditions that their Vietnamese colleagues were undertaking at the time, their work did comprise enlightening forays into a whole collection of herbals, recorded case studies and journal articles, in order to chase bibliographic leads and systematically map out individual medicinal plants according to available information on their botanical description, vernacular names, history, medicinal uses, chemistry, indications, side-effects and recommended dosages. The fruits of the BHMA Scientific Committee's labours came in the form of the first British Herbal Pharmacopoeia, which was published in stages starting with 115 herbal monographs in 1976 (the same year that traditional herbal medicines were included into Vietnam's national pharmacopoeia) followed by a further 83 in 1979 and 34 in 1981 (Griggs 1997: 282-83). The British Herbal Pharmacopoeia was the first of its kind in the West, but has since been followed up in Germany where 380 monographs were published by Commission E44 in the period 1983 to 1995; in the USA where an American Herbal Pharmacopoeia has been under development since 1994; at the European level where the European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy published 60 monographs in the period 1997 to 1999; and most recently at the international level where the WHO has published three volumes of monographs on selected medicinal plants since 1999. The point to be made is that, whereas herbals and treatises have undoubtedly played a key role in the identification and classification of medicinally useful herbs, the aim of monograph-based pharmacopoeias has been much more one of assurance and safeguarding. That is to say, while herbals and their authors continue to be celebrated to this day for the important contributions they have made, these herbals certainly do not constitute authoritative references on issues of safety, quality and efficacy.
