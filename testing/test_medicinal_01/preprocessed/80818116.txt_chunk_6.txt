The Agency of Medicines regulated the prices of 2700 registered drugs placed on the market in the R. of Macedonia on three levels: unique wholesale price, unique retail price and defined wholesale and retail mark-ups. In December 2011, after a series of attempts to perform regulatory pricing pressure on importers and manufacturers of drugs, the Agency has introduced a new Methodology (Official Gazette of RM No. 156/11, 2011). Core data on the price reductions of the registered drugs were provided by the Macedonian Agency of Medicines. Data are covering the period 2012-2015, during which 8 revisions were made. For the workflow control of the computer model and in order to produce data analysis we have used the programming language Python v3.5. Microsoft Excel was used for additional statistical analysis. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the result of the implementation of the new Methodology in Macedonia. ResultsThe introduction of the new Methodology and its implementation by the Agency for the period 2012-2015 resulted in price decrease of 1386 drugs (including all available registered dosage forms) out of total 2178. In total 680 drugs were lowered by more than 10%. The major price reduction happened in 2014, followed by reductions in 2015, 2012 and 2013. Furthermore, the analysis of the average price changes of the drugs shows that after initial 13% decrease of the prices in 2012, significant percentage of reductions was registered in 2013, followed by declining dynamics in 2014 and 2015. For objective research reasons we extended our analysis and grouped the pharmaceutical and dosage forms of the drugs. The results shows that since the introduction of the new Methodology until October 2015, a total of 843 drugs with the same INN have reduced prices. Major decrease by generics has been registered in 2014, in total of 355 generic drugs, followed by 2015 with 307 drugs, 2012 with 125 drugs and 56 in 2013. Our next focus was on averaging the percentages of price reduction of evaluated drugs. The results show that the major decrease of 23% was in 2013, followed by 18.4% decrease in 2014, 17.8% in 2012 and 10.8% in 2015. For more precise calculations we have used iterative calculation of the changes of the same generics year over year (YoY). By this same analysis, we have found that major price decrease were registered on glimepiride 88%, fluconazole 87%, ramipril 82%, bicalutamide 80%, torasemide 77% etc. Detailed analysis of the dynamics of price reduction of the drugs with the same INN shows that major reduction of the prices took place in 2014, when the price of 355 drugs was lowered, with over 32 drugs lowered by 30% or more. Second biggest price reduction took place in 2015 when 307 of the drugs have lowered price, but with lower dynamics of reductions compared to previous years. Moreover, the analysis clearly shows that in 2012, a total of 125 drugs with the same INN have lower prices with 12 drugs lowered on average by 30% or more. Finally, the lowest number of reduced prices of drugs was in 2013 (56 drugs in total), but with the highest average dynamic of reductions of 23% for the period 2012-2015. The average price change was the lowest in 2015 with reductions of only 10.8%, in 2012 with 17.74% and in 2014 with 18.4%. S1 OP 1240Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 39 - 40 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsObviously the dynamics of the average price changes of the drugs with the same INN is slowing down YoY, considering the fact that in most of the cases the price reductions are affecting the same generic groups. Next segment we have focused on was the evaluation of the drugs by the ATC code. Since the introduction of the new Methodology, major price reduction was registered in the Group L with total of 180 drugs and average price decrease of 27%. Next was Group N with a total of 123 generic drugs and an average price decrease of 19%. Group J with 119 drugs and average price reduction of 29% is "the leader" in terms of the relative number of generic drugs and the size of the price reductions. Finally, Group C where the price of total of 69 drugs was lowered in range between 77% and 10%. What is also noticeable is that the average price reduction in this ATC code group is 27%. 2012 tendencies by ATC classification show that the prices of a total of 119 drugs were reduced with average size of 26%. Major price decrease in 2012 by number of generic drugs was registered in Group N and by percentage of reduction in the Groups A and L. In the following year the price of a total of 63 generic drugs by ATC code was reduced with highest average decrease of 28% with major number of drugs in the Groups J, C, A and Group N. 2014 was the year of major changes concerning the number of a total of 276 generic drugs with reduced price by 27.7% as well as dynamics. Major developments are in Group L, with a decrease ranging from 51% to 24%. Second major changes were registered in Group M, reductions of 46% to 22%, Group J with a changes ranging between 58% and 10%, and Group N with a range of reductions between 64% and 11%. In 2015 the price of a total of 197 generic drugs was reduced with major decrease in the Group J with 51%, Group N with 46%, S with 44%, Group H with 35%, Group M with 32% and, Group N with 30% decrease. Finally we have analysed the ratios between the price reductions and the quantities sold by inserting on X axis average percentages of price reduction calculated by the use of iterative approach and on Y axis sales for 2015 given the year 2012 as basis with 100 points level. The result was a downward slope at rate -0.83x which confirms that the price reduction leads to declining sales of the generic drugs. It is noticeable that out of total 118 generic drugs with lowered prices for the period 2012-2015, in the year 2015 a total of 31 generic drugs have zero sales. Furthermore, 50 out of 118 in 2015 have higher sales than in 2012, but only 19 have increased sale of over 10%. Remaining 31 generic drugs have increase of sale sizing below 10%. Major part of the sales increase was registered for those generic drugs whose price was reduced by approximately 40%, but with the average size of sales stagnating in the range between 100 and 120 level. Finally we have analyzed the price-quantities changes for the period 2012-2015 by dividing the drugs with registered sale increase, and drugs with lowered sales after the prices were reduced. Contrary to the expectations, the group of drugs above level 100 has declining tendency of sale, which reflects the drop in the sales as consequence of continuous price reduction. In the second group, stagnation of the sales quantities is evident (y=0.1x). By excluding the zero sales drugs for the period 2012-2015, we came to the conclusion that the price reductions of generic drugs have insignificantly increased the sales of the drugs, whereby most of the drugs are bellow or on the levels of 2012.ConclusionThe introduction of the new Methodology in 2011 may look like a win-win solution in which the prices of number of drugs have been reduced, which is preferred policy target of the governments, and the patients have access to cheaper drugs. However, the price reductions of some generics did happen only on some registered dosage forms and for those the sale was dramatically reduced, or zero. The pharmaceutical companies have shifted the sale to the same generics but for different dosage forms, which at the end of the day creates similar profit ratio but it changes the composition of the portfolio offer for the drugs. The decrease of the prices has pushed down the level of sales of the drugs, which is a negative correlation and a clear signal that the supply side is negatively reacting to the price reduction.

In this heterogenic group of medicines there are different therapeutic proteins like insulin, filgrastim, growth hormone, erythropoietin, interferons and monoclonal antibodies. Often viewed as miracle drugs they offer hope, transforms patient's lives and provide cures and treatments for many severe diseases including diabetes, blood conditions, neurological disorders, autoimmune disorders and cancer. All that hope and promise that this treatments are offering comes with very high price that accounts for most of the biologicals. Data for global sales from 2014 are showing that approximately 80 billons US dollars are spend for this medicines. The predictions are that by 2017 global biological pharmaceutical market will amounts to about 220 billion dollars (Dolinar and Reilly, 2013). This trend of biological spending and growth is putting big financial pressure on the health care budget. The high price of this drugs and the financial crisis that has required healthcare systems to make significant cost reductions and in the same time patent expirations on many of the biological blockbusters were the main factors that drive the interest towards biosimilar medical products (biosimilars). Biosimilars are relatively new but growing segment, offering less costly alternative and enhanced competition to existing biological market. There is a strong interest by healthcare stakeholders in measuring the biosimilar utilization and impact on the market entry. Regulatory issues, manufacturing, safety, pricing, and physician and patient acceptance have a big influence in the developing the biosimilar market. By definition biosimilars are biological medicine similar toor a version of another biological medicine that has already been authorized, with similar active substance and which can prove their similarity towards quality, safety and efficacy (European Medicines Agency, 2014). Biosimilars began to enter European Union (EU) markets in 2007 and increase competition among producers of biologicals. However, the generic approach of substitution is not applied in the case of biosimilars due to their specificity (Weise et al., 2014). In the last years biosimilars have e significant clinical, regulatory and economic impacts in the medical market. At this moment there are 20 biosimilars with marketing authorization in EU, in seven classes as following: 7 Filgrastims, 5 Epoetins, 2 Folitropin alpha, 2 monoclonal antibodies, 1 insulin, 1 somatropin and 1 etanercept. When it comes to the market uptake of biosimilars, in the Consensus paper from EU Comission from 2013 (Consensus Information Paper, 2013) it was clearly stated that the most important conditions for market uptake of biosimilar medicines are driven by factors in the commercial market place. Differences across EU member states in national healthcare systems, have big impact on the biosimilars uptake. Factors influencing the market uptake of biosimilars are local pricing and reimbursement regulation, procurement policies and terms, physician perception of biosimilar medicine and patient acceptance of biosimilar medicines. There are differences in uptake by country, reflecting variations in local healthcare systems. Biosimilar penetration of the accessible market is only relevant when there is significant price difference between the originator and biosimilar, and where treatment options are limited to the molecule for which biosimilars are available. If the therapy area also has products that have been launched more recently, are still patent protected S1 OP 1342Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 41 - 42 (2016)Pharmacoeconomics / Social pharmacy / Drug informationOral presentationsand which bring differential clinical benefit to patients or segments of patients who do not respond to other therapies, then payers and health systems should more usefully understand the role of biosimilars in the context of the total class of therapeutic options. There are important factors driving biosimilar market performance which play out differently across therapy areas and countries. These approaches in turn are often influenced by budgetary or financing measures imposed on healthcare payers and those with responsibility for managing the drug expenditure budget (Ruiz et al., 2013). Patients can also influence the shape of biologic markets and the uptake of biosimilars through their advocacy voice, typically through patient groups that represent the interests of those suffering from certain diseases. Current differences in the use of biosimilars and competition dynamics across European markets are not just explained by epidemiology and disease factors, but instead reflect local adoption of treatment practices and guidelines influenced by funding decisions and payer actions. These decisions are often made with a narrow focus on medicine costs rather than a broader view that considers the full cost of administering the medicine to patients. Relevant measures and use of real world evidence are needed to bring policy-makers the level of transparency and visibility they need to assess options, make decisions and monitor the results (Wang and Chow, 2012). With respect to the use of biosimilars, these measures may include the appropriate expansion of access to patients who will benefit from biologics, the evolution of medicine cost, as well as the evolution of overall patient treatment cost and health outcomes.ReferencesConsensus Information Paper, 2013.

Community pharmacist must be sure that the patient has received and understood in a proper manner all the information provided, in order to safely and effectively use the medicines and improve the treatment out-come.In addition to dispensing medicines, patient counsel-ing presents one of the most important services rendered by community pharmacists (Puspitasari et al., 2009). The coun-seling process includes time, empathy and understanding, an individual approach and open communication with pa-tient (Puspitasari et al., 2009).
