Rosavinwas inactive is rats during a behavioral test of binge eating; while,salidroside dose-dependently reduced or abolished binge eatingfor the period in which it was elicited (Cifani et al., 2010). Inanother study, salidroside was more effective than rosarin androsin in inhibiting the expression of IL-1b, and IL-6 in microglialcells, while rosavin was not tested (Lee et al., 2013). Rosavininhibited the expression of the TNF-related apoptosis-inducingligand in concanavalin A activated Jurkat T cells, while salidrosidewas inactive and rosarin had an opposite effect (Marchev et al.,2017).It is unclear which analytical markers are important forassessing the quality and efficacy of R. rosea herbal preparationsintended for treating aging-induced mild cognitive disorders,such as attenuated memory, attention, and learning ability.Rhodiola preparations are usually standardized for salidroside(1%) and rosavin (3%). The content of active ingredients in herbalpreparations depends on many factors, such as the geographicand climate zone it was grown in, which season and under whatconditions it was harvested, and how it was dried, extracted,and prepared to give the final dosage form. For example, ahigh degree of inter-clonal variation was found for all testedconstituents (salidroside, tyrosol, rosavin, rosarin, rosin, andcinnamyl alcohol) in six samples of R. rosea roots collected invarious regions of Norway. The highest variation was foundfor salidroside and tyrosol, showing inter-clonal variations of92.8 and 87.8%, respectively (Hellum et al., 2010). Therefore,the preparations obtained by various producers can have quitedifferent active dose levels. Furthermore, the contribution ofthese active markers to the overall activity of the total extracts wasnot systematically assessed. It was suggested that these phenoliccompounds (rosavin, rosarin, rosin, salidroside/rhodioloside,and tyrosol) have no impact on activity of CYP450 enzymes anddo not inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP1A2 (Hellum et al.,2010; Xu et al., 2013; Thu et al., 2016a). The presence of minoramounts of herbacetin rhamnosides (rhodiosin and rhodionin)may presumably induce inhibition of CYP2D6 (Xu et al., 2013)in some commercial preparations of Rhodiola (Thu et al., 2016b,2017).It is a challenge to obtain reproducible efficacy and qualityof HMP, particularly for preparations of the underground partsof R. rosea (Panossian et al., 2010; Ioset et al., 2011; Bookeret al., 2016a). There may be unpredictable, complex interactionsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 42574fphar-09-00425 May 22, 2018 Time: 17:35 # 3Dimpfel et al. Quality Control of Rhodiola Extracts by BioassayFIGURE 1 | Chemical structures of active markers of R. rosea extracts.between the active constituents of the R. rosea extracts thataffect the regulation of molecular networks playing an importantrole in cellular and physiological functions of human organisms(Panossian et al., 2014). The pharmacological activity of R. roseacrude extract is related to many compounds, such as salidroside,tyrosol, rosavin, and other phenolic compounds (Sokolov et al.,1985, 1990; Barnaulov et al., 1986; Panossian et al., 2008; Leeet al., 2013; Marchev et al., 2017). The batch to batch reproduciblecontent of key active markers and the UPLC fingerprint arenot a guaranty of reproducible efficacy and safety. Additionalbioassays are required to assure reproducible pharmacologicalactivity of HMP. These bioassays may serve as validation toolsfor the quality assurance of complex HMP where the total extractcontains active pharmaceutical ingredients. In this context,assessment of the correlation between the content of activemarkers and pharmacological activity of HMP is important.Although the dose-response relationship of salidroside androsavin and dietary supplements was studied (Cifani et al., 2010;Lee et al., 2013; Marchev et al., 2017), to the our best of ourknowledge, the correlation between the content and biologicalactivity of various commercial R. rosea extracts has not beeninvestigated.The aim of our study was to assess the biological activity ofa selection of commercial extracts of the underground parts ofR. rosea and their analytical markers, salidroside and rosavin,in a synaptic model of memory: the long-term potentiation(LTP) of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (Bliss andCollingridge, 1993). An interesting result using this model wasthe ability of memantine, a substance used in the treatmentof dementia, to increase the population spike amplitude inresponse to single stimuli (SS) and to increase LTP (Dimpfel,1995). We used this method earlier for characterization ofelectrophysiological response of R. rosea in hippocampal slicesand have demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase ofthe amplitude of the population spike (Dimpfel et al., 2016b).These results relate very well to previous clinical results whereneurophysiological effects of R. rosea extract in healthy subjectswere characterized (Dimpfel, 2014).MATERIALS AND METHODSTest SamplesSeven dry commercial extracts were obtained from differentsuppliers via the Internet. Our selection strategy was to compareRhodiola extracts containing glycosides of cinnamyl alcohols(rosavins) with extracts containing only tyrosol and its glycosidesalidroside. Some of the extracts were from plants grown inthe Altai mountains of Siberia. The samples consisted of bulkpowders, obtained from water. According to the manufacturers'certificates of analysis and origin, they were hydroalcoholicextracts of R. rosea roots and rhizome (harvest of 2015). Sixextracts were preparations containing only root and rhizomepowders, while one, SHR-5 contained maltodextrin as a carrier(for details see Supplementary Data S1 and Table 1). Ourinclusion criteria were that products must be consumed as asolid dose or soft-gel manufactured item. Our exclusion criteriaincluded ethanolic tinctures and raw materials including driedroots, rhizomes, and bulk tinctures. Rhodiola SHR-5 extract hasbeen previously tested for efficacy and safety (Panossian andWikman, 2014) and was included as a control (i.e., registeredor licensed product). The samples of R. rosea L. roots andrhizomes extracts were identified by thin-layer chromatography(TLC) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)using salidroside, tyrosol, rosavin, rosarin, rosin, and cinnamylalcohol as reference standards (Supplementary Data S2).

The solvents (water, methanol,and acetonitrile) used for extraction and chromatographywere high performance liquid chromatographic grade (WatersCorporation, United States and Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).Preparation of the Analytical andReference Standard SamplesPowdered extract (0.3 g) was dissolved in 25 mL of solventsystem water:acetonitrile (90:10) using an ultrasonic bath for30 min. It was then filtered through a 0.45 um pore size filterand analyzed by UPLC. Powdered extract (1 g) was dissolved in10 mL of methanol using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min througha 00H filter. The filtrate was applied (10 uL) to high performanceTLC (HPTLC) plates. Stock solutions of the reference standard(2 mg/mL) in methanol was further diluted with methanol to200 ug/mL, 20 ug/mL, 2 ug/mL, 200 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and2 ng/mL.Analytical MethodsThe R. rosea extracts were analyzed with two basicchromatographic techniques - HPTLC and UPLC. Quantitativeanalysis of extracts was performed using a UPLC method,validated for linearity (Correlation coefficient R > 0.999),repeatability and the levels 50, 100, and 150% (RSD < 5%),intermediate precision at different days and analysts (RSD< 5%),accuracy (recovery in the range from 90 to 110%), selectivity(peak purity angle less than purity threshold with resolution> 2),range from 80 to 120% and robustness (RSD< 2%). Actual resultsare shown in tabulated form in the Supplementary Data S1,Table 2. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ)of UPLC methods were evaluated by calculations based uponthe standard deviation of the response (s) and the slope (S) ofcalibration curve and the following formulas: LOD = 3.3 s/S andLOQ = 10 s/S. The specificity, generally defined as the abilityof the UPLC methods to unequivocally assess the sample ofinterest in the presence of potential interferences, was evaluatedin accordance with the new regulatory guideline (USP 25). Inaddition to the evaluation of the resolution between the samplepeak and the next peak, a peak purity test based on photodiodearray (PDA) detection was tested to demonstrate that the samplewas pure with no co-eluting impurities. Specificity of the TLCmethod was based on the colors and Rf value of referencestandards bands on the TLC plates visualized as described below.UPLC MethodAnalytical instrumentation and chromatography detailsThe UPLC fingerprints of the Rhodiola extracts were analyzedusing a Waters Acquity UPLC system consisting of QuaternaryPumps Manager, Sample Manager, Column Manager, PhotodiodeDetector, and Empower 3 software (Waters Corporation,Milford, MA, United States).
