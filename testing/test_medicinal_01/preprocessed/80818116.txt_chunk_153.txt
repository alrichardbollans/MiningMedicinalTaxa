All regions in RM were represented, with prevalence of the capital, Skopje, with 28.9% followed by Pelagonija Region (Bitola, Prilep, Resen) with 16.1%, South-Eastern Region (Gevgeli-ja, Bodanci, Dojran, Radovis, Strumica, Valdandovo) with 12.3%, South-Western Region (Debar, Kicevo, Ohrid, Stru-ga, Vevcani) with 10.6%, Polog Region (Gostivar, Tetovo) with 9.7%, Eastern Region (Stip, Kocani, Berovo, Delce-vo, M.Kamenica, Vinica) with 9%, Vardar Region (Veles, Kavadarci, Sv. Nikole, Negotino) with 7.3% and North-Eastern Region (Kratovo, Kumanovo) with 5.9%. Female gender was represented with 90.5%. The dominant cohort (52.3%) was in age group of 23 - 35 years. The average community pharmacy experience was 11.88+-9.28 years. Nearly 42% were community pharmacy owners. Most of the surveyed pharmacists (53.12%) reported that communi-ty pharmacy they work in, has more than 2000 prescriptions and 29.03% reported 1000-2000 prescriptions dispensed per month. Overall job satisfaction was rated on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 refers to highest and 5 to lowest satisfaction. The determined average satisfaction was 2.24+-1.2 with mode of 1 in 30.32% and only 4.1% were not satisfied by their job as community pharmacists. The highest percentage of respon-dents (28.8%) reported counseling patients on OTC medi-cations 16-20% of their working time, which equates to the approximately 75 to 90 minutes during an eight hour shift. Slightly over 50% of the respondents reported that they were educated for OTC drugs during their undergraduated studies, however still high percentage - 46.67% were not. Approximately one third of the surveyed community phar-macists always advice patients for OTC drugs use while the majority (60.43%) frequently does that.Solely, continuing education courses were source of OTC drugs knowledge for 29.89% of surveyed partici-pants, working experience (practice) for 26.67%, under-graduated studies for 5.81% and pharmaceutical compa-nies for 4.73%. Combined, continuing education cours-es/practice was reported by 17.85% and undergraduated studies/practice by 7.96% of the respondents as OTC drug knowledge source. More than a half (57.2%) of the sur-veyed pharmacist agreed that OTC drug counseling is im-portant component of community pharmacy practice, while 42.6% strongly agreed with this statement. Nearly equal percent responded that they have enough time for OTC drugs counseling (41.94%) and opposite (not enough time - 42.79%). A majority (80%) agreed that patients accept their advices in respect to OTC drugs selection. Almost equally either agree or strongly agree (app. 50% each) that they are willing to provide OTC recommendations when given the opportunity. Confidence in own competentiali-ty (knowledge) related to adequate OTC drugs selection was expressed by 65.6% of the respondents. Participants were asked to rank their knowledge about certain OTC drugs classes, where 1 referred to highest and 7 to low-est rank. The highest scores were determined for cough/cold OTC drugs 1.89+-1.31 and pain/analgesics OTC drugs 1.96+-1.34, while the lowest scores were related to eye/ear and first aid OTC drugs, 5.16+-2 and 4.82+-2.24 according-ly. The results were comparable with the ranking related to the patients' demands for classes of OTC drugs coun-seling (rank of 1 indicated most frequently and 7 - least frequently). Advices for cough/cold OTC drugs were re-quested in average of 1.71+-1.12 and pain/analgesics OTC drugs, in average of 1.95+-1.35 with a mode of 1, 52.9% and 39.35% respectively. Patients` demands for first aid and eye/ear OTC drugs counseling were lowest with aver-age of 5.45+-1.96 and 5.35+-1.8 consequently.Respondents agreed (52.7%) and strongly agreed (44.52%) that patient counseling positively influence com-munity pharmacy practice. Most frequently (63.87%) ques-tions and advices for OTC drugs are initiated by the commu-nity pharmacists, while 27.3% are instigated by the patients. Majority of the surveyed participants, 61.94%, were interested for input into OTC drug counseling while 33.98% articulated high interest.Participants were asked to rank six quoted barriers/obstacles that might influence proper pharmaceutical care with OTC medicines in the community pharmacies. Rank of 1 referred to the most significant and 6 to least signif-icant barrier/obstacle. Lack of time and personal scarci-ty with average of 1.55+-1.22 and 2.78+-1.57 respectively, were identified as the most significant barriers/obstacles. ConclusionOutcomes from the conducted survey provided an in-sight to the main attitudes, willingness, barriers/obstacles and educational requirements of pharmacists in Republic of Macedonia related to self-medication with OTC drugs. The results obtained are valuable for the pharmaceutical community and can be used in order to improve and ad-vance community pharmacy practice by further promoting the pharmacist's role in self-care.ReferencesBakic-Miric, N., 2009.

Therefore, any low esteem or dissatisfaction conceived by any of the key components of the service chain may relatively threaten the comprehen-sive health care. Pharmacists as the key players in this mul-tidisciplinary sector are no exception to this rule. In Ban-gladesh a study was conducted to identify the factors af-fecting employee job satisfaction of pharmaceutical sec-tor (Parvin and Kabir, 2011). Given the noticeable lack of studies involving management styles with the job satisfac-tion of pharmacists this study attempts to address the gap in the literature. In 2007 Jovic-Vranes A. et al. found that job satisfaction was associated with good interpersonal re-lationships, working environments and a feeling of being able to provide good quality care. Other studies opine that there is a strong association between low levels of job sat-isfaction and organizational factors (Piko et al., 2006). A study by Krogstad U. et al. 2006, reflected that support and feedback from one's immediate supervisor was the main explanatory variable for job satisfaction among nurses. Bu-ciuniene et al. 2003, concluded that low salaries result in low job satisfaction among Lithuanian primary health care doctors. Rad, Yarmohammadian, 2006 and De Stefano et al. 2005, exerted that the greater the chances for develop-ment within the organization, the greater the likelihood of a higher level of job satisfaction. The results of Bodur, 2001, study showed low levels of job satisfaction mainly due to working conditions and salary. A significant relationship between job satisfaction and management style was exhib-ited in a master's' thesis by Nakata, 1992. The research questions of the present study are: 1. What are the management styles (MS) of first-line managers as perceived by staff pharma-cists (SP) in the marketing strategy depart-ments in selected pharmaceutical companies? 2. What are the management styles (MS) of first-line managers desired by staff pharmacists (SP) in the marketing strategy departments in select-ed pharmaceutical companies? 3. Is there a relationship between the perceived management style (MS) of first-line managers and the job satisfaction (JS) of staff pharma-cists (SP)? The purpose of this study is to determine the SP's per-ception on MS and its relationship to their JS working in MSDs in reputed pharmaceutical companies of Bangla-desh. This study also investigates the MS that SPs desire in their organizations. The broader purpose of the study is to provide information that might assist pharmaceutical com-panies in providing the best working environment for phar-macists' job satisfaction, efficiency and retention.Materials and methodsThe conceptual framework for this cross-sectional study design is based on Likert management theory which describes a continuum of four types of management styles and the adaptations of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Per-S7 PP 299626Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 625 - 626 (2016)Continuing professional developmentPoster presentationsceived and desired management styles (independent vari-ables) were measured by the Profile of Organizational Characteristics, Form SLM-1978 by Rensis Likert Asso-ciates, Inc. with response choices from l to 4. Each ques-tion requires two responses, one that describes the manage-ment style on the participant's working unit at the present time and one that describes how the subject would like the management style on the working unit to operate. Job sat-isfaction (dependent variable) was measured by a job sat-isfaction tool based on a tool developed by Munson and Heda (1974) which is based on the conceptualization of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The subscales measure: au-thoritative satisfaction, interpersonal satisfaction (belong-ing), involvement needs (ego needs), training/other facili-ties satisfaction, workload satisfaction and satisfaction re-garding payment/promotion. Additionally, demographic data, such as educational level, age range were collected. So, there were three types of interview questionnaires used for this study: Questionnaire A- written in English, con-sisting of 19 questions regarding job satisfaction among the pharmacists, Questionnaire B- written in English, con-sisting of 10 questions, each of them having 2 parts, one was for the perceived management style and the other for desired management style, Questionnaire C-7 items elicit-ed socio-demographic data including the respondents' age, gender, level of education. A sample of 384 individuals was randomly selected from 10 pre-selected pharmaceu-tical companies which belong to top 20 companies of the country. Data was gathered through face-to face interviews with individual respondents between July and October, 2015 and it was analyzed with the program SPSS v22.0.Results and discussionAmong the respondents 63.6% were male and 36.4% female. The data indicated that the SP currently perceive an overall benevolent-authoritative style of management on their units represented by an overall mean score of 4.66 which reflects less fear and punishment than in the exploit-ative-authoritative style but does not use staff involvement. The SP desired an MS approaching the participative group style with an overall mean score of 7.2 which expresses the necessity of a style that uses ideas solicited from the staff and asks for the staff's opinions on matters that af-fect their work.The JS subscale with the highest mean score was in-terpersonal satisfaction (4.27) which is associated with the concept of belonging and warmth in relationships at their workplace. The JS subscale score having the lowest mean was payment (3.42, where 3=Disagree slightly) which con-veys that SP were in general less satisfied with the income and opportunities and scope for promotion in their jobs.Null hypothesis H0: There is no relationship between perceived management style and job satisfaction. Alter-nate hypothesis Ha: There is significant relationship be-tween perceived management style and job satisfaction. The Pearson Product-Moment Correlation score for these two variables was r=0.436 (p=0.00000000000876) which convincingly rejects the null hypothesis and is further in-tensified by Spearman rank correlation and Kendall rank correlation coefficient r = 0.317 (P = 0.0000000156) and t = 0.239 (P = 0.0000000159) respectively.ConclusionThe strong correlation between management style and job satisfaction emphasizes the need to intervene with an appropriate organization-specific MS (i.e. participative group style) to promote JS among pharmacists.ReferencesBodur, S., 2002.

Macedonia* lea.taneska@gmail.com, risteska_eka@live.comIntroductionAcne vulgaris is a common chronic skin disease affect-ing ~85% of adolescents and young adults, although all age groups could be affected. Active pharmaceutical ingredi-ents (API) and commercial dosage forms that are common-ly used for acne treatment are characterized by lack of effi-cacy and number of side and adverse effects mainly relat-ed to the inability for targeted and controlled drug delivery. Currently, there is extensive ongoing research for finding alternative approaches for acne treatment. Topical appli-cation of propolis (natural bioactive compound) has shown notable efficacy against microorganisms etiologically con-nected with acne. However, often propolis extracts due to distinctive color, strong and aromatic odor and stickiness fail to ensure patient compliance.
