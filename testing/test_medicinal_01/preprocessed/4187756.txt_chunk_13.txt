Directive 2004/24/EC allows for "a special, simplified registration procedure for certain traditional medicinal products", which can now be classed as "traditional herbal medicinal products" and are distinguished by having "been in medicinal use for a sufficiently long time, and hence are considered not to be harmful under normal conditions of use" yet, "despite their long tradition, do not fulfil the requirements of a well-established medicinal use with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety" (European Council 2004: SS6, SS8, SS3). For this new class of products scientific documentation of its "traditional use" can be used as proof of safety, although because of the many safety concerns outlined above, national health authorities retain the right to request additional data before authorising it for sale. As far as quality is concerned, there are no concessions as all medicinal products (whether herbal or not) must comply with quality standards defined in relevant pharmacopoeias. Requirements of proof of efficacy for these products have, however, been reduced to the condition that "the pharmacological effects or efficacy of the 101 medicinal product are plausible on the basis of long-standing use and experience" (European Council 2004: Article 16a.1e, my emphasis),52 and consequently that it is clearly stated on product packaging or labelling that "the product is a traditional herbal medicinal product for use in specified indication(s) exclusively based upon long-standing use" (European Council 2004: Article 16g.2a). By requiring those over-the-counter products that have previously accessed the UK market through the section 12.2 exemption to apply for "traditional herbal medicinal product" status, it is argued that at least part of the gap in UK herbal safety and quality control can be plugged. Nevertheless, a final class of unlicensed herbal remedies in the United Kingdom remains, i.e. those that are combined or assembled on site as a direct result of a one-to-one consultation. But even this class of herbal remedies has come under pressure with an increasing number of calls to put effective safety and quality controls into place. In a recent consultation document prepared by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, it is argued that the section 12.1 exemption in its current form "lead[s] to inadequate public health protection", because "how can herbalists be assured that the raw or processed ingredients that they purchase for use in Section 12.1 remedies are of acceptable quality?" (Great Britain. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. 2004a: 31, 43) The consultation is ongoing and proposals to remedy the inadequate public health protection provided by Section 12.1 include the MHRA's suggestion that "a supplier of partially processed active ingredients could apply for a certificate of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)" (Great Britain. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. 2004a: 44) and the European Herbal Practitioners Association's proposal that the section 12.1 exemption should only apply to registered herbalists who "work to an agreed herbalists' Code of Conduct (analogous to the Pharmacists' Code) setting out Good Practice, for example over the use of reliable suppliers" (European Herbal Practitioners Association 2004: 1). And so, although it is pointed out that "in general, most herbal medicinal products are unlikely to pose a significant threat to human health" (Great Britain. Medicines Control Agency. 2002: A.2) and that they "cause fewer adverse events than conventional therapies 52 We will be returning to this notion of plausibility in detail in chapter 6. 102 such as treatment with conventional medicines (pharmacotherapy)" (WHO 2004a: 2),53 safety and quality concerns brought on by the industrialisation of herbal medicine have increasingly become the target of regulatory initiatives. The unregulated prescription, sale and use of 'natural', contaminated or adulterated herbal remedies is by now considered enough of a threat to warrant concrete normalising measures to protect the public health, as we have seen in both the Vietnamese and the British context. These have included: the compilation of herbal monographs and pharmacopoeias to minimise the risk of accidental substitution of medicinal plant species for inherently toxic ones; the introduction of Good Manufacturing Principles to limit possibilities of microbial contamination during production; the launching of "counterfeit drug" combating actions such as product recalls to punish manufacturers who deliberately adulterate their herbal remedies with prescription-only drugs; the introduction of elevated safety and quality requirements for any herbal remedy aimed for sale on the market (whether over-the-counter or prescription-only); as well as the introduction of sustainable harvesting practices to limit heavy metal and pesticide contamination. "Incompetent and dangerous practitioners" Notwithstanding my suggestion that quackery has been transformed in the past few decades opening up new roles and possibilities for alternative and traditional practitioners, as we saw earlier, the problem of dangerous practice is far from becoming redundant in herbal medicine today. However, rather than affecting the occupation in its entirety as was the case to a much greater extent in early 20th century Vietnam and Britain, incompetent and dangerous practice is now increasingly being addressed as a problem within herbal medicine itself - a consequence of the internalisation of dividing practices that I have spoken of. Hence, not only have the plants and products of herbal medicine been subject to a range of regulatory measures aimed at safeguarding the public, so too have the herbal practitioners who are in the business of prescribing and dispensing these products and remedies. As discussed in the previous chapter, a number of traditional and alternative therapies are currently installing self-policing procedures that many argue amounts to a professionalisation of their occupations as herbalists, acupuncturists, traditional medicine practitioners or homoeopaths. Increasing demands for their services have led to increasing 53 Griggs even argues that "the unrestricted over-the-counter sale of common pain killers such as aspirin or paracetamol probably pose a far greater threat to the public's health than all the herbal remedies and herbalists' prescriptions put together" (1997: 285). 103 demands for professional accountability and liability, as well as protection from incompetent or unscrupulous practitioners (Great Britain. Parliament. House of Lords. Select Committee on Science and Technology. 2000: 6.1). In the words of Prime Minister Tony Blair, "patients have a right to expect that the person who treats them is up to the job, government has a duty to ensure that they are" (cited in Great Britain. Department of Health. European Herbal Practitioners Association. Prince of Wales's Foundation for Integrated Health. 2003: 7), and in the United Kingdom and Vietnam this is by now, for the most part, regardless of whether that person is a medical doctor or a herbalist. However, as already underlined, there are striking differences as to the form and context of such measures of (self-)policing, from therapy to therapy and from country to country. This is certainly the case when looking at what has been happening with herbal medicine in Vietnam compared with the United Kingdom in the past few decades. In Vietnam, where a 1999 Ordinance on the Protection of Consumer Interests underlined that during the course of using any goods or services a citizen's "safety of life, health and environment shall be protected" (Vietnam. Ministry of Health. 1999b: Article 8), regulating the practice of traditional herbal medicine has been an integral part of the Vietnamese government's programme to modernise and integrate traditional medicine into national health delivery since the 1950s. As a result, Vietnam is one of the few countries in the world that is seen to be having an integrated approach to healthcare. We saw in the previous chapter how officially recognised traditional medicine practitioners in Vietnam have been classed into three different groups: an ageing group of 'purist' practitioners of classic Northern medicine (thuoc bac), some 8,000 or so practitioners who have either specialised in traditional medicine at Vietnam's medical colleges (Medical Doctors) or been trained at the Tue Tinh schools of traditional medicine (as Assistant Doctors), and finally a large group of apprentice-trained practitioners (so-called 'herb doctors') of Southern medicine (thuoc nam) who may also be familiar with Northern medicine.54 In today's Vietnam, it is by far the latter two groups who provide the majority of herbal medicine treatment, and for this reason it is worth looking at the ways in which their ability as practitioners has come to be problematised over the past decades. 54 There are about 40,000 biomedical doctors compared to anywhere between 30 and 70,000 apprentice-trained traditional practitioners in Vietnam (see chapter 3). 104 As we have already seen, traditional medicine was actively discouraged and scorned by colonial authorities in the early 20th century during which time there was a decline in systematic training of traditional practitioners. As a direct means to address this imbalance, the Vietnamese government began their efforts to fully integrate traditional medicine and its practitioners into national systems of healthcare delivery, education and research. This integration has happened via two specific routes: firstly, by making both modern and traditional medicine compulsory components of medical education and practice in Vietnam; and, secondly, by the organisation of 'herb doctors' into national associations as well as the development of a licensing system for these practitioners. From the outset of modernisation efforts, the Ministry of Health has stressed that central to their plans was cooperation between modern and traditional medicine practitioners. Four years after they had established a National Institute of Traditional Medicine in 1957 mandated with preserving and reviving traditional medicine, the Ministry of Health inaugurated what was to be the first of several Departments of Traditional Medicine at the Hanoi Medical College in 1961. All seven of Vietnam's medical colleges now have such a department, and all students of medicine are required to follow sixteen compulsory courses in traditional medicine (covering classical theory, diagnostics, medical botany and acupuncture) in the first four years of their degrees. Students can then choose to specialise in traditional medicine in their final two years (World Bank 1993: 30). Outside of Vietnam's medical colleges, the Tue Tinh secondary colleges of traditional medicine (the first of which was established in Hanoi in 1971) offer three-year "Assistant Doctor" diplomas, which likewise cover both modern and traditional medicine as well as providing further education and 'refresher courses' in the theory and practice of traditional medicine for practicing medical doctors (World Bank 1993: 31). Traditional medicine graduates from both the medical colleges and the secondary colleges are destined for work in the extensive network of health services found at national, provincial, district and commune levels in Vietnam. Further to the 40 or so specialised national and provincial hospitals of traditional medicine, the Ministry of Health stipulated by decree in 1976 that each district hospital was to have a department or section specialising in traditional medicine.55 Finally, it is also governmental policy that each commune clinic strive to have at least one staff worker specialised in traditional medicine, 55 These sections are often staffed by Assistant Doctors, although some medical doctors who have specialised in traditional medicine also work at this level. 105 responsible also for keeping a garden of medicinal herbs. Nevertheless, although the majority of Vietnamese people do have access to health care through either their local commune clinic, district hospital or provincial hospital, 'herb doctors' (apprentice-trained rather than college-educated traditional practitioners) continue to play an important role in the delivery of healthcare, especially in rural areas of the country. Herb doctors will often work in cooperation with commune clinics and district hospitals, but they constitute a separate category of traditional practitioner, subject to different practice requirements. A good share of these practitioners is represented by the National Association of Traditional Practitioners, which was founded in 1957 and has since expanded at the provincial and district levels. On the one hand, these associations of traditional medicine have played an important role in national efforts to map out medicinal plants and their uses in Vietnam, while on the other their members continue to train apprentices and provide medical services to patients via private practices, especially at commune and village levels. However, as we saw in chapter 3, the qualifications and competences of private traditional practitioners has become the subject of a series of ordinances and circulars since the early 1990s. In principle, all 'herb doctors' are now required to register their practices with provincial or district health authorities, and to apply for a practicing license in accordance with the Ordinance on Private Medical Practice and Pharmaceutical Practice as well as various follow up circulars from the Ministry of Health. As noted in a report for the World Bank, "a strong thrust of [this] legislation is to ensure that practitioners are properly qualified" (World Bank 1993: 41). Since July 1999 when Circular 13/1999/TT-BYT "guiding the implementation of the ordinance on the practice of private medicine and pharmacy as regards traditional medicine" came into effect, in principle all practitioners and dispensers of traditional medicine must be certified by the Ministry of Health. This circular further distinguishes between apprentice-trained traditional practitioners on the one hand, and traditional medicine pharmacists, producers, traders and raw materials (medicinal plants) dealers, all of whom are legally obliged to be certified on the other. Where apprentice-trained traditional practitioners are concerned, certification applicants are subject to an examination organised by health authorities in cooperation with provincial or district associations of traditional practitioners where their knowledge of fundamental theories of traditional medicine, biomedical pathology, pharmacology and ancient medical prescriptions are put to 106 the test (Vietnam. Ministry of Health. 1999a). Yet, this process of registering and certifying apprentice-trained practitioners is, however, for the most part only in its beginnings as by 2003 the Ministry of Health had 'only' licensed 3,715 private practices of traditional medicine (Huu and Borton 2003: 89), in sharp contrast to the estimated 20,000 members of the national Association of Traditional Practitioners. Nevertheless, whatever the gaps between regulatory intentions and outcomes, it is clearly this group of apprentice-trained traditional practitioners (as well as traditional pharmacists and traders of medicinal plants) who have come under increasing scrutiny in the past decade or so, especially as regards their training and qualifications. Although they are often highlighted for the important role that they can and should play in the provision of especially primary health care, a number of concerns about the abilities of apprentice-trained traditional practitioners have been raised. For example, the WHO in Vietnam lists as key concerns that: their explanations of efficacy can appear "mysterious"; some practitioners are not sufficiently qualified while others overstate their abilities; their lack of knowledge of modern medicine can be harmful to patients; and that they tend to keep their 'know-how' secret (WHO 2004b). In light of these kinds of concerns, Bui has argued that "if traditional practitioners are to play an effective role in health care, it is necessary to advance their professional skills" (Bui 1999: 33). And although, as already mentioned, this is a process that has only just begun, proposals and initiatives for addressing these concerns are plentiful, including the World Bank's suggestion that "concerns about qualifications could be offset by increasing on-job training for private practitioners" (World Bank 1993: 42), the above-mentioned Ministry of Health circulars and ordinances regarding the private practice of traditional medicine, as well as the WHO's call for "a distance learning programme... in response to the urgent need to upgrade the skills and knowledge of Traditional Medicine doctors working at provincial and district levels" (WHO 1997: 4). The various Traditional Medicine Associations and Secondary Schools of Traditional Medicine have also responded to these concerns by providing training courses and refresher courses for members, for example in the basics of anatomy and physiology (Bui 1999: 33; Huu and Borton 2003: 61). In contrast to their counterparts in Vietnam - where there are comparable numbers of traditional and modern practitioners - herbalists in the United Kingdom make up a minority of those providing health services for the many reasons already outlined in the previous 107 chapter. There are an estimated 2,000 practicing herbalists in the United Kingdom compared to 98,000 or so medical doctors (Great Britain. Department of Health. European Herbal Practitioners Association. Prince of Wales's Foundation for Integrated Health. 2003: 15). Moreover, while herbal medicine has enjoyed considerable, if fluctuating, public support over the past century in the UK, unlike in Vietnam it has remained separate from the National Health Service and from the curricula of most national medical universities and colleges.56 For these reasons, recent efforts to regulate the practice of herbal medicine in the UK have been more characteristic of a professionalisation of herbal medicine into an independent occupation, rather than an integration of it into existing national health delivery structures. Nevertheless, problematisations concerning the abilities and qualifications of its practitioners have been just as pertinent in the UK as they have been in Vietnam. The organisation of herbal medicine practitioners into associations that look after the interests and training of its members in the UK goes back at least to 1864 when the National Association of Medical Herbalists (later the National Institute of Medical Herbalists, NIMH) was formed. And ever since its Memorandum of Association came into force in 1895, they have distinguished between qualified and unqualified herbalists, actively sought "to train Medical Herbalists", worked "to repress malpractices", as well as investigated cases of "unprofessional conduct" through a General Council of Safe Medicine (Brown 1985; NIMH 1979). In lobbying for a Medical Herbalists Bill, the Association argued that "it is our desire to compel a standard of Education and Registration so that the public shall be enabled to differentiate between Bona Fide Herbalists and those who trade on the name" (cited in Griggs 1997: 262). Yet, as we saw earlier, this distinction did not gain official sanctioning during the first half of the 20th century and was firmly opposed by the medical establishment. In an increasingly hostile environment, they also struggled to finance a herbal medicine school that could ensure consistent training standards for its members. Indeed, Griggs has argued that what British herbalists faced in the period spanning the end of the 19th century to the mid 20th century was nothing short of "continuous... harassment, vexation and attempted legal suppression by the medical 56 In this connection it is important to note that the NIMH rejected an offer from the post WWII Labour government to become a part of the NHS as subordinates to biomedical doctors (see Griggs 1997: 265-6). 108 establishment" (1997: 234).57 The situation had become so dire by the late 1960s that, as the story goes, there were only a handful of actively practicing herbalists left. All this would change in the early 1970s as herbal medicine in the UK experienced the kind of tangible revival that has been common to so many different forms of CAM therapies in so many different countries. After intense lobbying, herbalists had secured the Section 12 exemptions discussed above, relieving herbal remedies provided through one-to-one consultations with herbalists and 'traditionally prepared' over-the-counter herbal medicines from the expensive safety and quality requirements that other medicinal products would have to adhere to.
