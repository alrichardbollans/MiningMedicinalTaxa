Antiseizure compounds identified from the ancient Greek medicinal plant Helleborus odorus subsp. cyclophyllus using a zebrafish epilepsy model.T. Brillatz1, M. Jacmin2,3, K. Vougogiannopoulou4, E.A.

A chemical and pharmacological investigation of the root methanolic extract (RME) of HOC was conducted using the zebrafish epilepsy model to define the compounds responsible for a potential antiseizure activity. The roots and aerial parts of HOC were extracted by solvents of increasing polarity. A root decoction of HOC was also prepared (RDE). The extracts were evaluated for antiseizure activity using a larval zebrafish epilepsy model with PTZ-induced seizures. The RME exhibited the highest antiseizure activity and was therefore selected for bioactivity-guided fractionation. Isolated compounds were fully characterized by NMR and HRMS. The HRMS/MS metabolite profiling of the RME and RDE were used for dereplication and chemical profiling. The RME of HOC showed an 80% inhibition of PTZ-induced locomotor activity. The extract was fractionated and resulted in the isolation of a new glucopyranosyl-deoxyribonolactone, a new furostanol saponin, 20-hydroxyecdysone, hellebrin, deglucohellebrin and a spirostanol glycoside derivative. The antiseizure activity of the RME was associated with the new furostanol saponin and hellebrin. A standard of hellebrigenin, the aglycone of hellebrin, was also found to be active. To further characterize the chemical composition of the RME and the RDE of HOC, 30 compounds were annotated by UHPLC-HRMS/MS profiling and included bufadienolides, furostanols, spirofurostanols and alkaloids. This study is the first to identify the molecular basis of the ethnopharmacological use of black hellebore for the treatment of epilepsy, which was achieved using a microscale zebrafish epilepsy model to rapidly quantify in vivo antiseizure activity. UHPLC-HRMS/MS profile revealed a large chemical diversity in the constituents of the extracts. The antiseizure activity of the extract and its components should be further investigated to reveal possible mechanisms of action.www.ethnopharmacology2021.org17620th International Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology Virtual Congress * 18-20 April 2021POSTER PRESENTATIONSGreek EthnopharmacologyP068. Medicinal plants of Chortiatis MountainS. Sarapis1, P.-R. Gavrilis2, E. Pantoudi1, I. Tzouvelekis3, M. Mironidou-Tzouveleki41 Postgraduate student, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece 2 Undergraduate student, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece3 Graduate, Department of Plant Production, Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki, Greece 4 Emeritus Professor of Pharmacology, 1st Laboratory of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GreeceThis study focuses on plants used for medicinal purposes, which are grown in Chortiatis Mountain in Thessaloniki. Today hundreds of medicines are released in the world with the use of medicinal herbs. Chortiatis has a plethora of wild flora. There have been recorded 94 families with 1220 different species and subspecies (Karagiannakidou & Raus, 1996).The sampling was carried out by hiking on May 17th, 2020 in two different routes in Chortiatis Mountain. Then, species were identified by special identification keys and a herbarium was made through strict instructions of a special manual.14 species of medicinal plants were collected in the first route and 11 species in the second route. From those species, 4 plants were selected (Anchusa officinalis, Cistus creticus, Galium aparine, Origanum vulgare ssp. hirtum) for further research of their morphological characteristics, historical data, ways of usage, medicinal substances they contain and their healing properties.Anchusa officinalis is generally used as a decoction or extract and has diuretic, antibacterial, antiviral and antioxidant properties. (Zelic et al., 2005). From Cistus creticus we use each extracts and each essential oil against cancer cells and pathogenic microorganisms (Dimas et al., 1999; Dimas et al., 2001; Dimas K., 2006; Demetzos et al., 1995). Galium aparine is generally used for the preparation of a decoction or as a poultice. It has antioxidant, antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties (Senio et al., 2018; Goryacha et al., 2014; Bokhari et al., 2013; Ilina et al., 2019), as well as apoptotic effects on breast and colon cancer cells (Aslanturk et al., 2017). Finally, Origanum vulgare ssp. hirtum is mainly used as a condiment, which is added in cookery. It has strong antibacterial effects it is an inhibitor against the growth of various fungi and has a strong toxic effect against viruses and against carcinogenic cells (Scortichini & Rossi, 1989; Biondi et al., 1993; Scortichini & Rossi, 1993; Sivropoulou et al., 1996; Paster et al., 1990; Paster et al., 1995; Skwarek et al., 1994)Karagiannakidou-Iatropoulou, V., Raus, T., (1996) Vascular plants from Mount Chortiatis (Macedonia, Greece).

In vitro evaluation of antioxidant, antiprotozoal and antimicrobial activity of medicinal and aromatic plants from the region of Epirus.O. Tsiftsoglou1,2, E. Sidiropoulou1, K. Kalaitsidis1, E.

Experimental material was consisted of leaves and flowers for sage, oregano and crithmum to obtain most of the active ingredients of the plant. Sage and oregano were collected from the mountainous region of Epirus (Souli, Paleochori, Filiates, prefecture of Thesprotia), whereas crithmum was collected from the prefecture of Preveza. Then, the herbal material was delivered to the Lab of Pharmacognosy, Department of Pharmacy, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, where the appropriate plant materials were hydrodistilled for two hours using a modified Clevenger apparatus. The volatile extract produced was collected according to the standard procedure described in the European Pharmacopoeia [1] The extracts were then preserved at 4 degC, in airtight closed containers until their employment in the in vitro tests and GC-MS analysis. Further analysis of the isolated essential oils (EO), included the determination of the Total Phenolic (TP) content and their antioxidant capacity measured by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test. The EOs were examined separately to test their antibacterial activity by disk diffusion agar method. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration was performed against some lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, as well as in pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, by broth microdilution method. All antimicrobial tests were implemented in the Lab of Animal Health and Food Hygiene and Quality, Department of Agriculture, University of Ioannina. Finally, the antiprotozoal activity of the EOs was tested in a bovine renal cell line (MDBK) after invasion with Eimeria tenella sporozoites [2]. The results showed that oregano EO had the highest concentration of polar phenolic components and even the strongest antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiprotozoal activity compared to the other examined EO.
