The absence of erythema and/or any impairment of the skin barrier func-tion in a 24-h occlusion study may preliminarily imply a satisfying safety profile of the creams and the used APG emulsifier.ConclusionThe study confirmed that a novel alkyl polyglucoside emulsifier, hydroxystearyl alcohol & hydroxystearyl glu-coside, could be classified as liposome-friendly. It was shown that in the system stabilized with lamellar phas-es, liposomes are apparently immobilized within its net-work and as such are mechanically stabilized. Addition-ally, due to the lack of skin irritation and skin barrier im-pairment during the application on healthy skin, it could be said that the investigated emulsifier is skin-friendly and may be safely applied as stabilizer for cosmetic or prospec-tive pharmaceutical emulsion carrier for liposomes.ReferencesKulkarni, V.S., 2005.

Macedonia* dmtlsn@unife.itIntroductionSunscreen products are cosmetics according to Coun-cil Directive 76/768/EC (CD 76/768/EC, 1976). The ef-ficacy and moreover the safety of sunscreen products, as well as the basis upon which they are claimed are part of extensive research because of the importance over the general human health. For the regulation of the sunscreen products referral to the EC 1223/2009 of the European Par-liament (EC1223/2009, 2009) and to the Recommendation EC 2006/647 (2006) on the efficacy and claims of sun-screen products was done. Based on this legislation it is necessary to validate the photo protection separately in the range of UVA and UVB, with in vitro and in vivo methods, with preference for the latter. The UVA range (320 - 400 nm) in vivo tests have been replaced with the in vitro tests, because of the con-sideration of the good correlation found, harmonized and standardized in the ISO 24443 (2012). For the UVB range (290 - 320 nm) the use of the method in vivo is still a ne-cessity, standardized by Standard ISO 24444 (2010), due to problems related to lack of correlation between the in vitro and in vivo data. The Sun Protection Factor (SPF) contin-ues to be widely used for describing the real performance of the product as well as its safety, and it is sometimes mis-understood, as the unique indicator for the efficacy and safety. Besides the numerical value of the SPF other prop-erties and factors have to be taken into account by the con-sumers. During the last decade the sunscreen formulations are enriched with many other ingredients such as boosters, antioxidants, immune-modulators. Also into many already marketed products for skin care and make up sunscreen fil-ters are added. Accordingly, it is more appropriate to describe perfor-mance as a whole formula protection factor: Formulation Efficiency Factor (FEF) calculated as SPF/actives % x 100 (O'Lenick and Lott, 2011). FEF as a new parameter in the sunscreen research relates the amount of active sunscreens in a formulation to the overall SPF of the finished prod-uct. A formulation chemist can quickly and accurately ap-ply the method to access the efficiency of a certain formu-lation. Sunscreens can be classified into three major cate-gories based on the formulation active ingredients: organ-ic, inorganic/organic and inorganic. In this complex pat-tern and to properly address our work toward the develop-ment of safe and effective solar products, we investigated the factors that influence the in vitro SPF determination. Having increasing problems in the determination of in vi-tro SPF values predictive of the in vivo assessment. With this work, we intended to evaluate, at first repeatability of the measure and, secondly, the accuracy of the same. Test variables of the in vitro SPF determination, such as substrate surface temperature, substrate choice and pres-sure of sunscreen spreading have been examined (Miksa et al., 2013).The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the type of product, way of application and method used to determine in vitro SPF.S4 OP 167356Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 355 - 356 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyOral presentationsMaterials and methodsSun Protection Factor (SPF) measurement and in vivo correlationSPF in vitro assessment was carried out on 80 random commercially available products, beside the 3 standard products prepared by us as reference formulating SPF from low and medium to high. Two different protocols for in vitro determination were used: the Diffey-Robson method (method A) and the ISO-24443 (method B), using tape and PMMA plates respectively with two different pressured ap-plied (100 and 200 g) for spreadability. In vivo tests of se-lected products were also obtained for comparison using a solar simulator SPF Ultraviolet Solar Simulator 600-150 W/300 W Multiport that provides ultraviolet radiation in the region between 290 and 400 nm from 6 independent outputs. The results were collected on 10 volunteers male and female, belonging to the phototype I, II and III, aged between 20 and 35 years.Different PMMA's and surgical tape Transpore TM, quantity of product, spectrophotometers (JascoV530PC and Shimadzu UV-2600) and method of application (man-ual and mechanical) were examined. For the ISO-24443 (method B), the tested product was applied to a new PMMA plate of 5 cm x 5 cm area, and 5 um of roughness (Schonberg GmbH). The application rate of 0.0128 g/cm2 +- 0.0003 g was controlled by mass. The application dose was determined by measuring the plates before and after the spreading operation. The application of the product has been realized according to the ISO 24443 (2012) guidelines by spotting, with a pipette, the product on several points all over the plate surface and then distributed by a finger-tip, pre-conditioned with the testing sample, for 30 second, with light circular movements; the plate is then positioned on a scale where the spreading phase is carry out perform-ing a pattern of movements in horizontal in vertical direc-tion, checking the pressure applied in all the moments. For all the products the spreading pressure is first of 100 g and in a second analyze of 200 g. Before the measure the sam-ple lies for a minimum of 30 minutes in a dark place. The spectrophotometer used in this method is a Shimadzu UV 2600 provided of integrating sphere ISR 2600 60 mm, and coupled with a SPF determination software: for each sam-ple the transmittance is measured from 290 to 400 nm. Ev-ery product has been measured 3 times, i.e. three different product applications on three different plates. Each sample has been tested in six different areas at least; therefore the results presented come from an average of 15 set of data.Results and discussionThe in vivo test is only a recommendation (EC 2006/647, 2006) and in fact many companies, limited by the cost of the in vivo procedure, are often relying on sole-ly the results from the in vitro or even on simulations from calculating software, based on the concentration of filters used. In our investigation, the limited reliability of in vitro method was confirmed on complex formulation. The cal-culated SPF data indicate that the spreading method devel-oped in our laboratory is reproducible for all the product test e with Cov% values less than 5%. Most accurate re-sults were obtained with the B method that, in terms of in-ternal repeatability and of acceptance parameters, provid-ed some correspondence with values obtained in vivo, in particular using PMMA plates standardized as the rough-ness, pressure, amount of product and way of application. In conclusion, our method B gave statistically sound re-sults and the better correlation between the in vitro and in vivo data, these data although preliminary, encourages us to further extend the study to a larger number of samples in order to better understand if any affordable method can be drawn on the basis of these premises.ConclusionOur study indicates that the variability of response is largely related with the standardization and thus harmoni-zation of the procedure between different labs and thus we suggest joint cooperative efforts toward a possible ISO def-inition of an SPF-Vitro protocol.ReferencesCD 76/768/EC, 1976.

Antonijevic* Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Greenwich at Medway, Chatham Maritime, ME4 4TB, UK* M.Antonijevic@gre.ac.ukIntroductionEmollients are therapeutic moisturisers that are usual-ly available as leave-on formulations of various types i.e. creams, ointments, lotions and gels (Ersser et al., 2007). These products are used for the treatment of dry skin con-ditions such as eczema and psoriasis (Voegeli, 2011). Due to the wide range of products available on the market it can be difficult to recommend the most effective and appro-priate emollients for the patient. As such, prescribers tend to recommend leave-on topical emollient products based primarily on patient preference and cost (Moncrieff et al., 2013). However, to achieve maximum benefit the emol-lient product must be both clinically effective as well as cosmetically appealing (Dederen et al., 2013). It is also recognised that emollient preparations are not the same even if claimed to be equivalent to other products, hence prescribers are encouraged to avoid false economy in their prescribing practices (Moncrieff et al., 2013). It is there-fore critical for manufacturers to develop innovative prod-ucts with optimised clinical performance and appealing sensory characteristics (Herman, 2007). To achieve this, application of simple and cost-effective analytical meth-odologies/approaches that can screen and compare such characteristics would be advantageous (Inoue et al., 2013; Stojiljkovic et al., 2013).Emollient gels are considered one of the most cosmet-ically acceptable leave-on topical formulations, because of their high water content and non-greasy feel (Ersser et al., 2007). These emollient formulations are oil-in-water (O/W) dispersions emulsified using, in general, carbomer gelling agents. The gelling agent(s) act as a physical stabi-lizer of the dispersed oil droplets, preventing phase separa-tion. The effectiveness of these formulations when applied to the skin, however, relies on the ability of the gel ma-trix to deconstruct, enabling the separation of the oil phase from the aqueous phase. This has the impact of allowing the oils (emollients) to spread easily and form a uniform occlusive barrier over the skin surface, whilst prolonging emollient retention on the skin by rendering the oily ingre-dients resistant to re-emulsification (removal) upon subse-quent contact with water (Ersser et al., 2007). The break-down of the carbomer gel matrix is influenced by the shear applied, but driven by the interaction of the formulation with salts on the skin (Noveon, 2002). The interaction of the emollient gel formulations with salts is therefore an im-portant consideration when occlusive performance of the product is of concern. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the physical structure changes under the influence of salts and compare two marketed emollient gel products, namely Doublebase Gel (DBG) and Zerodouble Gel (ZDG) mar-keted in the UK.Materials and methodsVisual appearanceCommercial samples of DBG and ZDG were dis-pensed into a container measuring 13 mm diameter by 1 mm deep and leveled using a glass slide. The samples were then allowed to stand at room temperature for 48 hours to allow evaporation of water. Behaviour under the influence of saltsNearly 10% w/w salt (NaCl) to gel was prepared by sprinkling 2.0 +- 0.1 g of NaCl onto 20 +- 0.4 g of each for-mulation and gently mixed by folding the sample on itself ten times using a spatula. They were then left to stand for S4 PP 168358Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 357 - 358 (2016)Pharmaceutical technology and biotechnology / Cosmetology / BiopharmacyPoster presentations30 minutes. Untreated control samples for each formula-tion were folded in the same manner without added salt so-lution.MicroscopyApproximately 20 mg of each treated and control sam-ple was mixed with Nile Red fluorescent dye. The sam-ples were then placed on microscopic slides and pressed with cover slips for 5 seconds. After 1h, the samples were viewed under a Laser microscope (Nikon eclipse 90i) x 60 magnification. Results and discussionConsiderable differences were observed between the surface characteristics and consistencies of the two formu-lations prior to salt treatment. DBG was found to have a smoother and a more homogeneous textural appearance when compared to ZDG. These differences were found to be even more evident on drying under ambient conditions. These differences in appearance could result from the man-ufacturing processes and the composition and quality of the ingredients used.Carbomers are sensitive to the presence of salts. The addition of small amounts of salt can be used to thicken the emulsion. The thickening of the polymer is brought about by repulsion of like charges on the polymer back-bone, causing the polymer to swell. Most carbomer grades have a tolerance limit of 0.1% salt (Noveon, 2002). In the presence of a higher concentration of salt, this repulsion is reduced, resulting in the collapse of the extended polymer chain and reduced viscosity. This behaviour of the poly-mer, in the presence of salt, is important for the delivery of the emollients during the application of these skincare products i.e. the salts on the skin are expected to break down the polymer, making the formulation spread more easily while releasing the emollient.The behaviour of the two gel formulations after com-ing into contact with salt (NaCl) were found to be differ-ent. The DBG formulation seems to largely break down into a liquid (decreased viscosity). The ZDG formulation, on the other hand, does not break down and instead appears to curdle and become firmer (increased viscosity). This im-plies that the polymers used in the manufacturing of the products are not similar. Furthermore, this difference in be-haviour demonstrates why the DBG formulation might be expected to spread more easily when applied to the skin.Microscopic examination also revealed differences be-tween the emulsions, both as original untreated formula-tions and following salt exposure. For DBG, the structural network stabilizing the oil droplets breaks down complete-ly, releasing the oil droplets from the emulsion.
