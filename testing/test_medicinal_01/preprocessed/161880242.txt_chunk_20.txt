The spindle staining procedure was originally described by Wissinger et al (1981).4.6.6 p~ and y-tubulin immunofluorescence staining.The prepared slides were fixed in ice-cold 90% methanol and air-dried (alternatively, they can be stored at -20degC until needed). The slides were then washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then fixed in 90% methanol at -20degC for 30 minutes, followed by 20 seconds in acetone at -20degC. The slides were then rinsed in PBT (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20). Subsequently, the cells were incubated with a diluted 1:200 mouse monoclonal anti-y-tubulin (T6557) in a humidified chamber at 37+-1degC for two hours. Then they were rinsed again in PBT followed by incubation with diluted 1:32 anti-mouse IgG Fab specific TRITC conjugate (T7782) in a humidified chamber at 37+-1degC for two hours. After another rinse in PBT, the slides were later incubated with diluted 1:100 monoclonal anti-a-tubulin conjugate (F2168) in a humidified chamber atCopy 1 163Y. SharifuddinChapter 437+-1degC for one hour. After another extensive rinsing in PBT, DNA was counter-stained with diluted DAPI.4.6.7 Slides Scoring Criteria.Mitotic index.For mitotic index measurement, slides were coded and 1000 cells per slide were scored to obtain the interphase:mitotic cells ratio according to the formula;Mitotic index (M.I.) = number of mitotic cells number of interphase cellsx 100Scoring was performed under 1000X magnification with oil immersion using Olympus BH-2 light microscope.Cell division aberrations (fluorescent microscopy).The immunofluorescence-stained slides were also coded and scored at 1000X magnification under oil immersion using an Olympus BH2-RCF fluorescence microscope. 100 cells per slide were analysed for a- and y-tubulin alterations, y-tubulin is a centrosome protein and involves in microtubule nucleation whereas a-tubulin is a microtubule monomer. * a-tubulin (microtubules) stained green. * y-tubulin (centrosomes) stained red. * chromosomes stained blue.Characteristics employed for identification:* Bipolar: cells with normal metaphase and bipolar microtubule organising centre (MTOC) division. * Tripolar: cells exhibiting abnormal metaphase with three MTOCs. * Tetrapolar: cells with abnormal metaphase due to four MTOCs and relatively more extensive aberrations. * Multipolar: More than four MTOCs present in a cell at the metaphase stage.Copy 1 164Y. SharifuddinChapter 4* Abnormal mitotit cells were scored as lagging chromosome (attached tomicrotubules), telophase bridge, multipolar whereas condensed chromatin were considered as dead cells.Figure 4.6 shows a flow chart highlighting all the necessary steps involved in elucidating the effects of andrographolide exposure on MTOCs and chromosomal aberrations in V-79 cells.4.6.8 Trypan Blue exclusion assay for cell viability.The assay was conducted as described in Section 3.5.13 in Chapter 3.4.6.9 Studies on Mitotic Fate and Cell Recovery4.6.9.1 MCL-5 cellsCulturing and treatment procedures employed for MCL-5 in these cell fate and cell recovery studies were the same as those described in Sections 3.5.4 and 3.5.6 but without the addition of cytochalasin-B. The cells were grown in carefully labelled, 25cm flasks and subjected to andrographolide treatment for 24 or 48 hours. After the treatment phase, cells intended for cell fate assessment were promptly harvested as described in Section3.5.7 and on the other hand for cell recovery experiments, the cells were harvested via centrifugation at 1500rpm for 5 minutes.For the continuous treatment of MCL-5 cells with andrographolide, the cells were left in the presence of andrographolide for 5 cell cycles (120 hours) before being harvested as conducted previously.4.6.9.2 V-79 cellsFor V-79 cells, the same culture and treatment procedures were followed as described in Sections 4.6.1 and 4.6.3. After exposure to andrographolide for 24 hours, the cells were harvested according to the aim of the experiments. For assessing aberrations in MTOCs and chromosomes, the slides that were grown in Petri dishes were carefully and gently washed twice with pre-warmed PBS in a sterile Petri dish. Autoclaved forceps was used when handling the slides and the tips of the forceps were briefly dipped into 90% ethanolCopy 1 165Y. SharifuddinChapter 4then dried before the next slides are handled. New Petri dishes were used for each slide.Washed slides were promptly placed in new Petri dishes with fresh growth medium and incubated at 37+-1degC with 5% CO2 in air for another 24 and 48 hours respectively. After these recovery periods, the slides were harvested as described in 4.6.4. Staining procedures were the same as those stated in Sections 4.6.5 and 4.6.6.For cell fate study involving V-79 cells, the cells were grown in 25cm flasks rather than Petri dishes as described in Section 3.5.5 and treatment was performed as in Section 3.5.6 in the absence of cytochalasin-B. The method employed was similar to that of MCL-5 as described previously but both floating and cells that were attached to the flasks were collected for harvesting using the cytospin as described in Section 3.5.7.Three replicate experiments were conducted for each study. Figure 4.7 displays the important steps employed in studies for cell fate, cell recovery and continuous treatment with andrographolide.4.6.10 Statistical analysisThe Fisher's Exact test was used for the analysis of cell division aberrations and 95% confidence limits were accepted as the measure of significant difference unless otherwise stated. Analysis was performed via the Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis website accessible via http://home.clara.net/sisa/Copy 1 166Y. SharifuddinChapter 4Fig 4.6 Flow chart for important steps involved in assessing MTOCs, mitotic index and chromosome aberrations in V79 cells.ANDROGRAPHOLIDE TREATMENTAfter 24 hours, the cultured cells were treated with andrographolide at selected concentrations; then incubated for another 24 hours.CELLS CULTUREDV-79 cells were cultured at 37+-1degC in DMEM which was supplemented with 10% horse serum and gassed with 5% CO-).CELLS SEEDEDThe cells were then seeded at approximately lxl(T cells/ml onto sterile microscope slides in Petri dishes and incubated at 37+-1degC with COt for 24 hours.SLIDE HARVESTINGAfter one cell cycle, the growth medium removed and the slides were washed with cold PBS twice; fix with ice-cold 90% methanol and air-dried. The slides were kept at-20degC until needed.CONVENTIONAL STAININGThe slides were stained with:* Brilliant blue* Safranin OIMMUNOFLUORESCENCESTAININGThe slides were stained with:* T6557* T7782* F2168* Counter-staining with DAP ICopy 11 6 7Y. SharifuddinChapter 44.7 RESULTSCell division aberrations due to andrographolide exposure were investigated in Chinese | hamster lung fibroblasts V-79 cell line. The mitotic spindle fibres and chromosomes were | stained with Brilliant blue and Saffanin O respectively; visualised using light microscopy | to assess cell cycle irregularity and shifts in mitotic index value. Abnormalities inii! microtubule organising centres (MTOCs) were qualitatively evaluated using fluorescentiI microscopy for better accuracy against using conventional dyes. The effect ofI| andrographolide on MTOCs integrity in interphase and mitotic cells were investigated using immunofluorescence of y-tubulin, a centrosomal protein whereas microtubule j organisation was examined by means of a-tubulin immunofluorescence. Quantification of multiple MTOCs actuation was performed by establishing the relationship between the number of tubulin signals with different concentrations of andrographolide.In untreated interphase cells the microtubule network was constructed all over the cells and centrosomes were detected as a one-spot signal of y-tubulin as shown in Figure 4.8.In untreated mitotic cells, two spots of y-tubulin signals co-localised with spindle poles. Incubation of the cells with andrographolide for 24 hours induced abnormal tripolar, tetrapolar and multipolar spindles that co-localised with three, four and multi-spots of y- tubulin signals respectively. In contrast, the presence of andrographolide did not influence the microtubule architecture and the number of y-tubulin signals in interphase j cells. Data as shown in Table 4.1 revealed a pattern of steady and significant (p<0.05)i: dose-dependent accruement in multiple MTOCs with tripolar mitosis being the most prominent. Tetrapolar and multipolar mitoses also increased significantly with reduction in normal bipolar spindle ratio in scored mitotic cells respectively. Concomitantly, mean percentage mitotic index also accrued in a dose-dependent fashion. Figures 4.9 and 4.10 shows examples of a bipolar, tripolar, tetrapolar and multipolar V-79 cells.Copy 1 169Y.

All cells were observed to possess direct association between spindle poles (y-tubulin) and microtubule (a-tubulin) as shown in Figures 4.9 and 4.10. There were no visible disruptions to the microtubule network. An increase in mitotic index was observed at 10pM, continued at 30 before beginning to decrease again at 50pM. Between lOpM and 30pM of andrographolide, the increased mitotic index value indicated aberrant MTOCs was affecting cellular division and causing mitotic arrest that can be followed by cell death. Although, higher MTOCs were observed at 50pM, the mitotic index began to decrease steadily in tandem with reduced cell viability frequency observed at 70 and 90pM of the compound. As shown in Figure 4.11(A), dead cells were not scorable for centrosome integrity. The data on the positive control, colchicine was also shown in comparison to andrographolide with expected outcome.16 14 12 10 SS 8 6 4 2 00 10 3 0 5 0Andrographolide (pM)Fig. 4.12 Graph showing the induction o f aberrations in mitotic spindle and centrosome organisation in V-79 cells after 24 hours continuous exposure to andrographolide.# Mean % Tripolar# Mean % Tetrapolar# Mean % MultipolariCopy I 1 7 2Y. SharifuddinChapter 4The cells seemed more able to tolerate the presence of tripolar MTOCs where 3.02% of untreated V-79 cell populations possessed this feature as compared to less than one percent of cells with tetrapolar and multipolar centrosomes respectively, illustrating that higher number of MTOCs are not sustainable and cells are less likely to survive the next rounds of mitoses. Furthermore, prior to harvesting, the number of floating and unhealthy-looking cells inside the petri dishes was observed to be higher than viable cells attached to the slides in a dose-dependent manner, where higher andrographolide concentration was affecting cell number.12010080o 6040204 -5=3 20I Mean % Bipolar I Mean % Multiple * Mean % Mitotic index10 30Andrographolide (pM)50Fig. 4.13 Graph to compare and contrast the reduction in normal bipolarity with increases in multiple centrosomes (tripolar, tetrapolar and multipolar) and mitotic index accruement.Andrographolide (pM)# Mean % Abnormal mitosisFig. 4.14 Shows the incidence o f abnormal mitosis in V-79 cells exposed to andrographolide for24 hours.Copy I1 7 3Y. SharifuddinChapter 4The incidence o f abnormal mitosis was also determined and as shown in Figure 4.14 and the data in Table 4.2 the frequency of aberrant mitoses increased in relation to andrographolide concentration. The presence of more than two spindle poles affected normal chromosome segregation process.Table 4.2.

The cells were exposed to andrographolide for 24 as well as 48 hours, evidently the frequency of non-viable cells increased steadily with dose, in agreement with cell growth reduction. The duration o f andrographolide treatment also affected V-79 cell viability as shown in Table 4.3 and Figures 4.15 respectively. Thus, andrographolide cytotoxicity is dose- and time-dependent in V-79 cells. Figure 4.16 shows the effect of different concentrations of andrographolide with different treatment time on V-79 cell growth.Table 4.3 Mean percentage o f non-viable V-79 cells treated with andrographolide for 24 and 48 hours with corresponding cell growth values (percentage to negative controls).0 6.83 26.50 100.00 100.0010 7.08 44.98 85.64 69.S2*130 14.45* 81.41*2 59.12* 26.89*250 38.25* 91.08*2 58.39* 15.48*270 61.10" 94.91 *2 21.90* 8.34*290 75.76" 94.88*2 14.11* 5.66*2^Statistically significant values (p<0.05) against the negative controls. 2 denotes significant difference (p<0.05) between 24 and 48-hours treatment.Copy I 1 7 4I . o r i u r i j u u m nChapter 4B 24 hours H 4 8 hours0 10 30 50 70 90Andrographolide (pM)Fig. 4.15 A comparison o f non-viable cell frequency between 24- and 48-hour treatment o f V-79 cells with different concentrations o f andrographolide.
