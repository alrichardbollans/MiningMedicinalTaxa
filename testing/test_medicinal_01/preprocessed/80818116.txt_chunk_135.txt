The endogenous ligand neuropeptide Substance P (SP) selectively binds to NK1 receptor at the plasma membrane (Munoz et al. 2011). SP is an undecapeptide that belongs to the tachykinin peptide family and widely distributed in both the central and the peripheral nervous system of mammals. Activation of NK1 receptor by SP stimulates G-protein mediated signaling pathways that are crucial for regulating cellular excitabil-ity and function such as cAMP accumulation, arachidon-ic acid mobilization and phosphatidylinositol turnover. It has been shown that activation of Akt suppresses apoptosis and stimulation of NK1 receptor by SP induces phosphory-lation on Akt or Protein Kinase B (PKB) activity in human glioblastoma cells. After binding to the NK1 receptor in tu-mor cells, SP induces mitogenesis and inhibits apoptosis. Hence NK1 receptor antagonists can lead to apoptosis and inhibit tumor cell proliferation. Antagonists of these recep-tors inhibit the development of metastasis by blocking the activation of NK1 receptor by SP. It is shown that NK1 re-ceptors are overexpressed in tumor cells and their antago-nists such as aprepitant, L-733,060, and L-732,138 have antitumor activity against several human cancer cell lines such as melanoma, neuroblastoma, glioma, retinoblasto-ma, pancreatic, larynx, gastric and colon carcinomas (Mu-noz et al. 2011). It has been demonstrated that binding sites of pep-tide antagonists and non-peptide antagonists of NK1recep-tor are different than each other. SP and peptide NK1 re-ceptor antagonists bind to the extracellular terminal region of the receptor, but non-peptide NK1 receptor antagonists bind to intracellular part of the enzyme between transmem-brane helices (Munoz et al. 2011). Ligand binding pock-et of an NK1 receptor is a hydrophobic core between the loops of transmembrane TM III-VII. Several residues, such as Gln165 (TM IV), His197 (TM V), His265 (TM VI) and Tyr287 (TM VII) are involved in the binding of many non-peptide antagonists of the NK1 receptor. The other resi-dues that are contributed in non-peptide antagonist binding are Ser169, Glu193, Lys194, Phe264, Phe267, Pro271 and Tyr272 (Almeida et al. 2004).Over the last decade our group have been designed, synthesized, and working on the new anticancer active compounds. Some of our previously synthesized benzoxa-zole and benzamide compounds showed significant inhib-itory activity for human DNA Topoisomerases and Gluta-thione S-transferases and also anticancer effects observed on various cell cultures (Pinar et al. 2004). In this research, we aimed to search the activity of our previously synthesized compound, 2-[4-(4-ethylbenzami-do)phenyl]benzothiazole (BSN009), to the new anticancer target NK1 receptor and to identify the binding site fea-tures and modes of NK1 receptor and the non-peptide an-tagonists including our synthesized compound using mo-lecular docking study.Materials and methodsThe cytotoxic activity of tested compounds (BSN009, CP-96345, L-733,060, L-732,138, and aprepitant) were as-sayed using the MTT colorimetric protocol. MTT is cleaved to formazan by the "succinate-tetrazolium reductase" sys-tem (EC 1.3.99.1) which belongs to the mitochondrial re-spiratory chain and is active only in viable cells. Human S6 PP 264554Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 553 - 554 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationscolon carcinoma cell line HT-29 (ATCC, HTB-38), breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (ATCC, HTB-38), human cervi-cal carcinoma cell line HeLa (ATCC, CCL-2) and mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 (ATCC, CRL-1658) were used in this study for cytotoxicity experiments.To analyze the binding site features of the tested com-pounds the molecular docking studies were performed by using CDocker working with Accelrys Discovery Studio (DS) 3.5 software.The homology model of the NK1 receptor with CP-96345 was developed by Evers and Klebe. For prepara-tion of protein and ligands the target protein was taken, hy-drogens were added and their positions were optimized us-ing all atom CHARMm forcefield and the Powell method available in DS 3.5 protocol. The minimized protein was defined as the receptor using the binding site module. The binding site was defined from the cavity finding method which was modified to accommodate all the important in-teracting residues in non-peptide antagonist binding site of the NK1 receptor. The protein was held rigid while the li-gands were allowed to be flexible during refinement. The docking and scoring methodology was first validated by docking of ligand CP-96345. The docked position of CP-96345 overlaps well with the homology model position,Results and discussionOur previously synthesized compound, 2-[4-(4-ethyl-benzamido)phenyl]benzothiazole (BSN009) was found as an active compound at a concentration of 50 mM as a result of MTT assay and inhibited colon cancer cell lines growth about by 57.53%. On the other hand, it has also been found that BSN-009 had no toxic effect on the normal cell line. As a result of the molecular docking studies; BSN-009 was shown similar binding modes with NK1 receptor as known antagonists L-733,060, aprepitant, and L-732,138. The tested 2-substituted benzothiazole, BSN009, has hy-drogen bonds with Gln165 (2,39 Angstrom) and His197 (1,83 Angstrom) like other non-peptide antagonists of NK1 receptor Oxygen atom of carbonyl group of BSN009 makes an H bond with His197. The phenyl ring of the ben-zamide group of BSN009 has a pi-cation interactions with His187. Binding energy values (kcal/mol-1) of BSN009 and aprepitant, which is a well-known NK1 receptor an-tagonist, is close to each other.ConclusionIn conclusion, the performed molecular docking study elucidated that Gln165, His197, His265 and Tyr287 are crucial amino acids in the non-peptide binding site of the NK1 receptor. As a result of the molecular docking study and cytotoxic experiments, it can be concluded that BSN009 may be a good anticancer drug candidate as an NK1 receptor antagonist and is worthy to carry on the an-ticancer in vivo studies. This study also provide a model to design novel and more potent antitumor agents as NK1 re-ceptor antagonists.ReferencesAlmeida, T.A., Rojo, J., Nieto, P.M., Pinto, F.M., Hernandez, M., Martin, J.D., Candenas, M.L., 2004.

Development of a new drug is connected with quantitative structure-activ-ity (properties) relationship, QSA(P)R, research. Lipohi-licity is the key physicochemical property of a molecule which depends on its structure and determines its phar-macokinetic behavior and biological activity. Due to its high cost-effectiveness and fair reproducibility, thin-lay-er chromatography (TLC) is one of important alternatives for quantifying lipophilicity of drug candidates. The aim of this study was to calculate hydrophobicity index C0 with reversed phase (RP) TLC methods of 14 compounds with assumed antiepileptic activity and to examine whether C0 values can be applied in QSA(P)R studies.Materials and methodsRP TLC was used for study of the retention behav-ior of N-(3- or 4- substituted phenyl)-2,2,-diphenyl-succin-imide derivatives. Substance number 1 (s1) is not substi-tuted, s2-s11 have attached in para position: -CH3, -OCH3, -OH, -NO2, -CN, -F, -Cl, -Br, -I, -COCH3, while s12-s14 have in position meta -CN, -OH and -Cl, respectively. Pre-coated RP-18W/UV254 10x10 cm plates (Macherey-Na-gel GmbH and Co., Duren, Germany) were used as sta-tionary phase and binary solutions of water with acetoni-trile with a varying volume fraction, ph (0.45-0.65) of or-ganic solvent, were the mobile phase. Each analyzed com-pound was dissolved in acetone (c=2mg/ml) and 0.2 ul al-iquots with a micropipette were spotted on the chromato-graphic plates. Ascending technique with previous satu-ration of the chambers was used. After development, the spots were detected at 254 nm with UV lamp and Rf val-ues were measured. For each compound analyzed in this paper, logP values (logarithm of the partition coefficient of the compound) and logD values (log of the distribution coefficient of the compound at pH=7.4) were determined by the usage of different algorithms (www.alogps.com and www.acdlabs.com). Physicochemical parameters as num-ber of rotatable bonds (RB), numbers of hydrogen bond donors (HBD), hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), polar sur-face area (PSA) and molar weight (MW) were obtained, as well. Finally, for each compound ka (constant of absorp-tion in min-1) and logBB (logarithm of blood-brain barri-er, BBB permeability) were predicted (www.acdlabs.com). All calculations and statistical analysis were done by use of software package Origin 8.0.Results and discussionRetardation factor, RM was calculated for each com-pound according to the equation: RM=log(1/Rf-1). Further-more, in the linear correlation of the RM values versus ph, the chromatographic retention constant RM0, was obtained as extrapolated value to 0% point: RM=RM0+Sxph. The iso-cratic chromatographic hydrophobicity index, C0, is calcu-lated as RM0/S and it is defined as point when the amount of S6 PP 265556Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 555 - 556 (2016)Clinical Pharmacy / Pharmaceutical chemistry / Biomolecular SciencesPoster presentationsthe analyte in the mobile and the stationary phase is equal. Since, C0 is usually applied for quantifying lipophilicity of the compound; it has been compared to the computer calculated logP values. Highly significant linear correla-tion with good correlation coefficients has been observed between the C0 values and in silico logP/logD values (r2=0.78, r2=0.94 and r2=0.77 for MlogP, ClogP and logD, respectvely) in which substance with OH group in posi-tion meta (s13) was an outlier. It has been assumed that s13 forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond since OH group as HBD is close to dione group which is HBA. Probably due to this kind of interactions, s13 has reduced affinity to form hydrogen bonds with water and to be eluted with the mo-bile phase when compared to its isomer, s4 which does not have possibility to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond.Regarding the physicochemical characteristics and re-lationship with "druglikness" properties of the compounds investigated, according to Lipinski's rule of 5, poor absorp-tion or permeation are more likely for compounds which have >5 HBD, MW>500, logP>5 and >10 HBA. As previ-ously reported, none of the compounds violates even sin-gle rule. Moreover, additional rules for good oral bioavail-ability were proposed by Veber: <=10 RB, <=140A2 PSA, or <=12 HBD+HBA. Analyzed compounds do not violate Ve-ber rules hence good oral absorption can be expected. Ac-cording to in silico data absorption rate is practically iden-tical for all the examined compounds (ka between 0.051 to 0.053 min-1). The main assumption is that the effect of the core consisted of three phenyl groups attached to suc-cinimide ring may overwhelm that of the substituent and slight changes in lipophilicity determined by C0 practi-cally do not affect their absorption rate. Physicochemical properties influence the passive BBB permeation of com-pounds. Set of BBB rules was compiled by Clark: N+O<6, PSA<60-70A2, MW<450, logD=1-3, ClogP-(N+O)>0 in order for the compound to permeate through BBB. All compounds violate one or two rules (high logD and/or PSA), while s5 violate four rules. Nitro group has defined positive and negative poles and it is partially ionized in-hibits BBB permeation of s5. Since BBB permeability de-pends on lipophilicity (Di et al., 2003), logBB was present-ed as function of C0 and square equation with good statis-tical quality (r2=0.658, p<0.001) was obtained.ConclusionFor the analyzed succinimide derivates, experimental-ly obtained C0 values are comparable to the in silico deter-mined logP/logD values with s13 excused from the com-parison. Retention parameter, C0 can be proposed for ex-pressing lipophilicity of the analytes examined in this pa-per and it can be applied in QSA(P)R studies.
