The toxicity of dimethoate results in deleterious effects caus-ing oxidative stress on many organs and systems in human and animals particularly the kidney, liver, testes, brain, ner-vous, and reproductive system (Abou-Baker et al., 2014). The cellular antioxidant defense is reinforced by the pres-ence of dietary antioxidants. Accordingly, there has been recently growing interest in the role and usage of natural antioxidants as a strategy to prevent oxidative damage in various health problems (Saafi et al., 2011).Laurocerasus officinalis Roem. is known as "cher-ry laurel" in English. L. officinalis is grown as a native fruit crop locally called "taflan, lazkirazi, karayemis"on the coasts of the Black Sea region of Turkey (Erdogan-Orhan and Kupeli-Akkol, 2011). The fruits and seeds of the L. officinalis are widely utilized as herbal medicine in Turkey for the treatment of stomach ulcers, digestive sys-tem problems, bronchitis (seeds), eczemas, hemorrhoids, anti-diabetic (seeds), analgesic on local pain, and as a di-uretic (fruits) (Ayaz et al., 1998; Elmastas et al., 2013; Kupeli-Akkol et al., 2012; Senayli et al., 2012; Yaylaci-Karahalil and Sahin, 2011). By in vitro models a neuropro-tective effect of the fruits of L. officinalis was found (Er-dogan-Orhan and Kupeli-Akkol, 2011). In vivo experimen-tal study determined the anti-inflammatory effects of L. of-ficinalis leaves (Kupeli-Akkol, 2012). L. officinalis fruit is rich in phenolics and a good source of natural antioxidant protecting humans from several diseases caused by oxida-tive stress (Yaylaci-Karahalil and Sahin, 2011). The aim of the study was to determine the nephrotoxic effects of dimethoate on biochemical indicators of kidney function tests, oxidative stress parameters, and histological examination in rats and the protective/ameliorative effects of L. officinalis fruit extract. Materials and methods60 male Wistar albino rats were divided into six ex-perimental groups of 10 rats each and were treated daily by oral gavage for 60 days. Group I (control group) re-ceived only saline (0.9% NaCl); Group II was treated with dimethoate; Group III was given fruit extract; Group IV was treated with fruit extract and dimethoate; Group V was treated with vitamin C and dimethoate; Group VI was ad-ministrated only dimethoate for the first month. During the second month, the rats were treated with dimethoate and fruit extract. Dimethoate, L. officinalis fruit extract, and vitamin C were applied at 7, 4, and 100 mg/kg/day dos-es, respectively. At the end of the 60 days, rats were an-aesthetized by ketamine and xylazine. Blood samples were taken from hearts to the sterile tubes and centrifugated at 3500 rpm for 20 min to separate serum. The serum sam-ples were stored at -80 degC until analysis of blood urea ni-trogen (BUN) andcreatine. The kidneys were removed im-mediately and washed with sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). They are divided into two sections. One section was S3 OP 116252Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 251 - 252 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionOral presentationsplaced in formaldehyde solution for routine histopatholog-ic examination by light microscopy. The other half of kid-ney tissue section was homogenized in ten volumes of ice-cold 140 mMKCl and Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.6) us-ing a homogenizer for 2 min at 13.000 rpm. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) for lipid peroxidation index were determined in the tissue homogenates by using spectropho-tometer. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 5000 g for 60 min to remove debris. Clear supernatant was used for superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glu-tathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activity assays. Results and discussionIn comparison to the control group, a statistically significant increase was observed in the serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatine in dimethote treat-ed group (p<0.05). However, administration of L. offici-nalis to dimethoate treated groups (group IV and VI) pro-vided a markedly reduction in levels of BUN and creatine (p<0.05). Moreover, vitamin C treated rats to dimethoate treated group showed decreased BUN and creatine lev-els (p<0.05).Treatment with dimethoate caused an increase in the kidney tissue levels of MDA as compared with the control group (p<0.05). However, treatment with L. officinalis to dimethoate treated groups (group IV and VI) provided a re-duction in MDA levels compared to the dimethoate treated group (p<0.05). The antioxidant enzymes activities of SOD and GPx in the group of only dimethote treated rats were significantly lower than those in the control group. Howev-er, L. officinalis treatment resulted in a significant increase of SOD and GPx activities (p<0.05). The activity of CAT enzyme was markedly decreased in dimethoate treated rats and elevated in L. officinalis treated rats as compared to control rats, but this effect was not statistically significant.The kidneys of the control group showed normal kid-ney parenchym. With light microscopic examinations, his-topathological changes such as mononuclear cell infiltra-tion, glomerular atrophy, congestion and necrosis in the kidney tissues were observed in the dimethoate treated group as compared with control group. Administration of L. officinalis apparently reduced kidney tissue damage. On the other hand, there were not any differences in histologic appearance of kidneys between the control and L. officina-lis treated group. Also, the kidney morphology in vitamin C treated group was similar to that of the control group.The antioxidants may play a major role in the preven-tion of diseases related to oxidative stress. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the research of antioxidant com-pounds such as phenolics present in the plants (Erdogan-Orhan and Kupeli-Akkol, 2011). These phenolics provide protection against toxic radicals due to their radical scav-enger activities and have therapeutically beneficial effects on human health (Yaylaci-Karahaliland Sahin, 2011). It was found that L. officinalis fruit extract has strong radi-cal scavenging activity and antioxidant effects (Erdogan-Orhan and Kupeli-Akkol, 2011; Kolayli et al., 2003). ConclusionIn conclusion, dimethoate exposure indicated the dis-ruption of nephrotic architecture in kidney section as com-pared to control group. We observed that L. officinalis fruit extract pre- and post- administration to dimethoate treated rats significantly reduced kidney injury by preventing oxi-dative damage. Therefore, L. officinalis fruit may be useful for the prevention of oxidative stress-induced kidney injury.This research was financially supported by Research Fund of the Erciyes University Scientific Research Project Unit (Project number: TCD-2013-4127).ReferencesAbou-Baker, S., Assem, A.K., Sherif, R.M., Eldesouky, T.A. 2014.

In respect to probiotic foods both the viability of the probiotic within foods and bioavailability within the host has to be studied (Figueroa-Gonzalez et al., 2011), while at least maintaining the quality of conventional prod-uct used as a carrier. Microencapsulation may offer good protection of probiotic viability loss during manufacture, product storage and after ingestion of probiotics, especial-ly during exposure to unfavorable GI conditions (Sanchez et al., 2012).The aim of the study was to obtain a functional prod-uct ayran with therapeutic level of viable and metabolic ac-tive cells of L. casei 01 (a minimum of 107 log CFU per mL ayran). Quality of the prepared probiotic and synbiotic samples was examined as well as their therapeutic benefits in animal model with chemically induced colitis.Materials and methodsAyran samples were prepared by fortifying commer-cially available product (Ayran, Zdravje, Macedonia) with non-encapsulated probiotic L. casei 01 (Chr. Hansen, Den-mark) and/or prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (Syn-ergy 1, Orafti-Rue L. Marechal, Belgium) and encapsulat-ed synbiotic. Synbiotic microparticles were produced when an overnight activated culture in MRS broth (37 degC, 24 h) with a cell load ca. 11-12 log CFU/mL in a mixture with 4% w/w alginate (Protanal LF 10/60 LS, fG 35-45%, FMC BioPolymer, IMCD, UK) and prebiotic (1.5% w/w) was infused to the spray-dryer (Buchi Mini Spray Dryer B-290, SW). Spray-drying was performed at inlet and outlet tem-perature of 120 degC and 58+-3 degC, respectively, flow rate 6 ml/min, nozzle diameter 0.7 mm, aspirator pressure 90% and atomizer pressure 600 Nlh-1. Polyelectrolyte com-plexation/cross-linking of the dried powders was done un-der continuous stirring for at least 3 h with 0.5% w/w chi-tosan (Chitine, France) and 5% w/w CaCl2 (Merck, Ger-many) dissolved in 1% v/v acetic acid. The hardened mi-croparticles were freeze-dried (-50 degC, 0.070 mbar, 24 h) (FreeZone Freeze Dry System, Labconco, USA) (Petres-ka Ivanovska et al., 2014). Analyses of the quality of ayran samples include determination of protein, fat and carbohy-drate content of the ayran by Bradford, Gerber and phenol-sulphuric acid methods, respectively, while the total solids were determined using gravimetric method. Titration acid-ity (lactic acid,%) and pH measurements were also eval-uated. AAS and HPLC was applied to quantify minerals and organic acid production, respectively. Then, to female Wistar rats (n=6, 180-250 g, 10-14 weeks old), function-al ayran samples (8.5-8.9 log CFU/mL of the food prod-uct) were administered orally, once and twice daily. Plain ayran and drinking water were given to positive controls. Two weeks after starting the experiment, the rats were fast-ed overnight and those from the positive controls and treat-ed groups were rendered colitic. Colitis was induced intra-rectally at 8 cm proximal to the anus using TNBS (trinitro-benzenesulfonic acid) dissolved in 50% ethanol at a dose 10 and 30 mg/kg.
