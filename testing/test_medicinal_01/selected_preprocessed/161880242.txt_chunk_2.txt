Traditional medicines are still widely used in developing countries and are increasingly popular in developed countries. In certain parts of the world, it is the only geographically accessible and economically feasible mode of healthcare. Globally the public, health professionals and policy-makers are wrestling with the questions about the quality, efficacy, safety, preservation and further development of this type of health care. This thesis is focusing on herbal applications in traditional medicine and highlighting the need to ensure safe application of medicines derived from plants.Modem pharmaceutical dmgs are based on chemicals with active properties and many drugs used today have been discovered through research into the physiological effects of phytochemicals, which are chemicals derived from plant sources. The primacy of plants as the source of new drug discoveries throughout human civilisation remained unrivalled until the recent competition from combinatorial chemistry (Schreiber, 2000) and computational drug design (Clark and Pickett, 2000), which effectively reduced its influence in dmgthdiscovery process. During the 20 century especially since the Industrial Revolution, efforts gradually shifted from producing medicinal plant extracts to synthetically producing these phytochemicals or their active analogues. Figure 1.1 highlights the factors that contribute to the decline of natural products in drug discovery and development. Although many can now be synthesised, such as aspirin, which is a safer analogue of salicylic acid derived from Salix alba, some of these dmgs are still derived directly from plants (e.g.Copy 1 10(c)s(U00cd0 --- 2 d>>'J j i (fi 5O 2 C3 y:n P w>-- 1 r * c / iC3 ^ SO c/500 H * =# JPS^ S' i . ^o deg c.2 & y c5EQ ._ o<U>0>T3~oCCd>Oo. a'- 3ooPS PS c 2 3 .2 * - > ' PS G -5 c -- c u.^ ' o OCJ <+C'I - a s.2 * PSCQ "5 -2> co o S~D C<U &H deg.

SharifuddinChapter 1digitalin from foxglove, Digitalis sp.). Chemicals in some plants are extracted and transformed, providing the building blocks of drugs (e.g. progesterone, synthesised from chemicals found in some species of wild yam, Dioscorea sp.). Generally, phytochemicals are referred to as new chemical entities (NCEs) especially in the industry circle and viewed as templates for structure optimisation in making perfect new drugs. Other compounds are potentially useful to humans or are of toxicological relevance.Although synthetic chemistry is currently more appealing as an approach to produce new drugs, flora's contribution in preventing and treating diseases cannot be ignored. At the beginning of the 21st century, it was reported that 11% of the 252 drugs regarded as vital by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and about 25% of drugs prescribed worldwide were solely derived from plants (Rates, 2001). Furthermore, 49% of 877 new chemical entities introduced between 1981 and 2002 were natural products, semi-synthetic natural products or mimics based on natural-products (Newman et al., 2003). As shown in Figure 1.2, there was an increasing trend in natural product patents worldwide whereas Table 1.1 lists the percentage of identified medicinal plant species in selected countries and the world in general.400-1Cl*PS 20: -1 0 0 -# Total woHdwide natural-product patents [H Original natural-product patentsT384 1985 1986 1997 1 998 1939 1993 1991 1992 1933 1994 1 935 1 936 1997 1993 1999 2*000 2C01 2002 20C6Fig 1.2. Worldwide pharmaceutical natural product patents. Original natural product patents refer to all firsttime grants o f patents for novel composition o f small molecule natural products as pharmaceuticals. Whereas those for total worldwide natural products are global grants for patents asserting composition-of-matter or small natural products applications as therapeutics. One single natural product can generate several patents based on multiple filings in different countries or for different indications. (Adopted from Koehn & Carter,2005. )Copy I3Y.

This is especially true in areas where there are insufficient synthetic leads. Furthermore, plants have utilised a more holistic tactic in their biochemical defence against pathogens by producing arrays of structurally and functionally diverse anti- pathogenic compounds that act in concert, not only to neutralise the threat but also in averting the development o f resistance in the future. For example, Berheris fremontii (Fremont barberry) produces both anti-microbial berberine alkaloid and inhibitors of a bacterial pump that strongly potentiate the activity of berberines (Hsiang & Lewis, 2000). It is for the same reason that made herbal medicines appealing not only to the scientific community but also to the public, where multi-factorial nature of many complex diseases such as psychiatric disorders and cancers cannot be ideally solve with a 'single golden molecular bullet'. Most of these diseases are not a result o f one single factor but from a combination of genetic, behavioural and environmental influences. Furthermore, many proteins and molecular targets are involved in complex biochemical and cellular processes. Thus, carelessly tampering with one reaction might affect the others.Pharmacognosy (derived from Greek words pharmakon, 'remedy', and gignosco, 'knowledge') is the science of biogenic or nature-derived pharmaceuticals and poisons. It concerns all medicinal plants including those yielding complex mixtures, those used in the crude forms or extracts (phytotherapy), pure compounds such as morphine, and foods having additional health benefits (nutraceuticals). Phytomedicines generally refer to herbal medicinal products used in phytotherapy. Phytotherapy should not be confused with other "special therapeutic disciplines" that also utilise plant materials such as anthroposophy and homeopathy. Homeopathy, whose efficacy is still being critically assessed, was proposed by Samuel Hahnemann and works on the principle o f 'similia similibus curentur'- similarCopy I4Y. SharifuddinChapter Isymptoms are healed by similar medicines. Furthermore, homeopathy mainly involves really low doses where 'efficacy' is believed to increase with dilutions, in stark contrast to current scientific comprehension.There are various ways in which plants can be used as therapeutics as listed in Table 1.2.Herbal teas and other homemade remedies are very popular. Crude or standardised extracts can be prepared in pills or capsules and can also be use as tinctures. Ultimately, as mentioned briefly before, successive extraction and purification procedures to isolate phytochemicals from plants of interests, that is bioactive and can be used straight away as drugs (e.g. ergotamine and digoxin) or use as leads in hemisynthetic processes.Table 1.2.

One good example would be artemisinin. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene trioxane lactone containing a peroxide bridge that is necessary for its activity, was first isolated by Chinese researchers from Artemisia annua (sweet wormwood) and its structure was elucidated in 1979 (Klayman, 1985). Various soluble and more active forms o f artemisinin have been synthesised to combat malaria. The phytochemical and its derivatives kills Plasmodium in all stages o f life cycle by interacting with heme resulting in carbon-centred free radicals, which alkylate protein thus damaging the membrane and microorganelles o f the parasites (Meshnick, 1998). Up to this day and to the best of the author's knowledge, there are no known cases of artemisinin-resistant malaria in humansCopy 1 5Y. SharifuddinChapter 1(Balint, 2001). Figure 1.3 highlights the evolution of Artemisia annua application starting with traditional medicine to modem drug discovery and Figure 1.4 shows the similar passage of the senna plant. The variety of development and use of natural products is shown in Figure 1.5.1.2 Increasing Public Interest in Phytomedicines and PhytotherapyIt is widely accepted that there is an increasing use of phytomedicines by the general public to replace or complement allopathic medicines (Newall et al., 1996). This revival of interest in phytomedicines is largely driven by the public's increasing interest and confidence in self-medication (Blenkinsopp and Bradley, 1996). There are many reasons for the increasing popularity of phytotherapy and most likely to include the following:* Increasing consumer interest in self-medication. * Increasing consumer interest in using herbal remedies as daily supplements. * As a complementary to allopathic medicine. * The popular notion that phytomedicines are safe and natural. * Growing concern about the adverse effects of synthetic dmgs. * Disappointment with the efficacy of conventional dmgs, especially in chronic conditions. * The desire for a more natural lifestyle. * Cost factor. Herbal medications are normally available over the counter and are cheaper than prescribed modem dmgs.The world market for phytomedicines is estimated to be PS38 billion (UNCTAD, 2000). It is estimated that Europe imports about 400,000 tonnes of medicinal plants annually with Germany as the largest market and consumer of medicinal plants, spending about PS1.4 billion, followed by France with PS116 million (Masood, 1997). The UK is third in place.As highlighted in the House of Lords Select Committee's report on complementary and alternative medicine, comprehensive information on the use of herbal medicines in the UK is insufficient (House of Lords, 2000). There are several estimates available but it is difficult to make an accurate determination as many products could be categorised as foodCopy 1 600 <N1I<3*>55*= O> .
