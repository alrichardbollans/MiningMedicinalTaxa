The pungent components responsible for themedical uses are the alkaloids called capsaicinoids. Capsaicin (trans8-methyl-N- vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is a major pungent lipophilicalkaloid of Capsicum fruits. Dermatological ointments of capsaicin areused for therapeutic purposes to treat peripherial painful diseases, like:rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, muscle pain, etc. Especiallycompelling are the promising results of medical studies showingpossible beneficial effects in many diseases. Isola tion of capsaicinfrom Capsicum fruits was described by many authors with differentmethods of extraction. Generally extracted directly from fruit hasmade necessary the using of established methods to increaseproduction through extraction. Over time these methods haveimproved, usually by applying existing techniques with some importantchanges. The most uses methods are maceration, Soxhlet extraction,supercritical fluid extraction (CO2) and ultrasound. The aim of thisstudy is to define and to optimize the efficacy of these extractingmethods applied to Albanian's Capsicum fruits.In this work are applied three methods of extracting capsaicin fromwhole pepper with organic solvents: maceration, Soxhlet andultrasound extraction. Maceration process undergoes with threesolvents: ethanol 95% for 24 hours; acetone for 2 h; ethyl acetate for24h. The Soxhlet extraction is realized with two solvents: ethanol 95%and acetone. The third process of extraction is done by usingultrasonic bath with two organic solvents: methanol for 20 minutesand acetonitril for 1 hour (3 x 20'). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is used to identify the presence ofcapsaicin on ground dried red pepper obtained from local markets inFier, Albania. Extraction and qualitative determination was carried-out in duplicatefor each method.The extraction of capsaicin by using organic solvent extractionmethods is useful and efficient. The most easy and appropriatemethods are maceration and ultrasound extraction. These methodsare not time consuming and also not much solvents are used. Theperformance of the processes is depending by the extraction methodand the solvent. Also the selectivity between all the methods is donerelying in toxicity of the solvents.In conclusion, all the three methods give good results in the extractionof capsaicin.The thin layer chromatography analysis confirms the presence of thiscompound in the Capsicum fruits.REFERENCES:Sanatombi K., Sharma G.J., 2008, Capsaicin content and pungency of differentcapsicum spp. Cultivars.

They are exploited commercially for a varietyof purposes including medicines, detergents, adjuvants and cosmetics.A large number of the Gypsophila mono- and bidesmosides have beenisolated and characterized (2-4). Excised root cultures of G. paniculatahave been described and the existence of saponins in them has beenreported (5). The aim of our study was to compare the accumulationof triterpene saponins, with focus on a prosapogenin gypsogenin 3-O-glucuronide, in roots and excised root in vitro cultures of Gypsophilaspecies.Excised root cultures from six Gypsophila species (G. paniculata, G.trichotoma, C. glomerata, G. elegans, G. scorzonerifolia and G. viscosa)was performed allowing continuous growth without phytohormones(6). Established on MH3 medium (5) from solid-grown seedlings theseroots were subcultured for one year on solid medium before any trans-fer in liquid medium to obtain substantial biomass for saponin con-tent analysis. Saponins were extracted from the in vitro and in vivoroots by sonification. After a mild acid hydrolysis of the extracts (7),the prosapogenin gypsogenin 3-O-glucuronide was isolated by SPE anddetermined by UPLC/ESI/MS. The quantitative determination of theprosapogenin was performed by RP-HPLC using a mobile phaseconsisting of acetonitril and phosphoric acid (0.1%).The saponin content in the roots of intact plants G. paniculata andG. trichotoma was compared with that of Saponin White (Merck). Inaddition, the prosapogenin quillaic acid 3-O-glucuronide was deter-mined. The quantitative determination of the prosapogenin revealedbetween 7.5 and 9 mg/g dry weigh in the roots of Gypsophila species.The maximum content was recorded for Saponin White giving valuesof 166 mg/g which represent 22-fold more compared with G.paniculata. The relative ration of the two prosapogenins in the rootsof G. paniculata was 71.4% of gypsogenin 3-O-glucuronide and 19.6%of quillaic acid 3-O-glucuronide. Significant growth for in vitro rootcultures of G. glomerata was achieved within 3 weeks on liquidmedium; biomass grew up to 50-fold in batch cultures reaching 10 g196Makedonski farmatsevtski bilten 57 (dodatok), 2011MEDITsINSKI I AROMATIChNI RASTENIJA poster prezentatsiiPETTI KONGRES NA FARMATsIJATA SO MEGjUNARODNO UChESTVODW (average dry biomass 5.68+-4.08 per explant). The root dry weightrecorded in G. elegans was 0.92+-0.54 g. The growth was similar for G.scorzonerifolia and G. paniculata; the dry weight reached 0.29 g and0.34 g per explant, respectively. Minimum growth was observed in G.trichotoma cultures. Generally, the dry weights were 2.9-5.9% of thefresh weights, which closely paralleled the fresh weights responses.The fingerprints of the saponin HPLC profiles of the root in vitroGypsophila cultures were drastically different with at least up to 30different saponins detected for some of them. The roots of G. elegansaccumulated saponins (expressed as gypsogenin 3-O-glucuronide) upto 65 mg/g DW (mean value 31.36+-31.83 mg/g DW). These amountswere higher than in G. paniculata and G. trichotoma roots found inthis study and as the best producing ones (30.2-40 mg/g). The cell linesof G. glomerata showed a smaller quantitative amount of saponins(between 1.3 and 7.10 mg/g DW) than those of G. elegans but nearlythe same HPLC profiles as for root extracts of intact G. paniculata.The other species showed a smaller production of saponins after 3months of subculture. However, individual lines (each line culturesrepresenting one phenotype) of G. scorzonerifolia, G. paniculata andG. trichotoma showed variation in gypsogenin 3-O-glucuronidecontent: in some cases the levels were below LD or LQ. Generally, thecontent of gypsogenin 3-O-glucuronide was not related to the growthrate of the cultures: the maximum average content recorded in G.elegans cultures in liquid medium represented 8-fold increasecompared with that found in G. glomerata, but the mean dry biomasswas 6 times lower.In conclusion, the biosynthetic behavior of Gypsophila species assayedwas different but we found gypsogenin saponins in all excised rootcultures which prove that in vitro root culture can contribute inproducing saponins from Gypsophila. It could be suggested thatselection of cell lines of G. elegans and G. glomerata may be effectivefor enhancing the saponin production in Gypsophila root cultures.REFERENCES1.

It is well knownthat free radicals are normally produced during the metabolicprocesses and that, in physiological conditions, their harmful effectover bio-molecules is disabled by the activity of endogenous (repre-sented mainly by antioxidant enzymes) and exogenous (representedby dietary antioxidants) antioxidant barrier. In conditions of extremelyhigh production of free radicals within the biological system and/orlack of endogenous and/or exogenous antioxidants, a state of oxida-tive stress occurs, which has been proven to be the basis of manychronic diseases, primarily atherosclerosis, various cancers and neu-rodegenerative diseases. Considering the involvement of oxidativestress in the pathogenesis of above mentioned chronic diseases, nu-merous trials were conducted to study the possible preventive effectof antioxidant (pro)vitamins: beta-carotene, vitamin C and E. Incon-sistent and mainly negative results of these trials, as well as positive re-sults from research on the effect of diet rich in fruits and vegetablesand of green tea on chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress,favored the use of natural versus synthetic antioxidants.
