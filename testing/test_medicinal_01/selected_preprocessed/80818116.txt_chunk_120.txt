One of the sam-ples was also tested for homogeneity dependant on the sampling position (bottom, top, middle, centre, left, and right).The method used for the identification and determination of isoflavones in red clover extract was developed in physico-chemical laboratory of Quality Control (QC) Pharmanova, and validated according to ICH guidelines. The technique used is HPLC with UV-VIS detector (254 nm). Separation is achieved using a Phenomenex(r) Luna C18 (2), 250 x 4.6 mm, 5 mm particle column, at isocratic elution at 1 mL/min, using the following mobile phase: acetonitrile: 0.5% phosphoric acid (40:60, V/V).Results and discussionIndividual and total isoflavone content was determined in three test samples. The results presented in percentage (%, m/m) represent the average of two consecutive results of the same sample:1. Test sample I: daidzein 0.52%, genistein 0.51%, formononetin: 19.99%, biochianin A 11.31%, total isoflavones 32.33%2. Test sample II: daidzein 9.26%, genistein 11.29%, formononetin: 17.80%, biochianin A 3.66%, total isoflavones 42.01%3. Test sample III: daidzein 3.38%, genistein 8.72%, formononetin: 15.53%, biochianin A 18.25%, total isoflavones 45.80%In order to get information on the homogeneity, one of the extract was sampled from different positions of the S5 PP 236496Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 495 - 496 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsbulk package. The total isoflavone content was determined from each of the samples and the results were as follows, top: 43.38%; bottom: 44.21%; middle center: 43.36%; middle left: 42.77%; middle right: 43.87%. When the results were statistically processed, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was found to be 0.54%, while the recovery percentage in relation to the declared value was in the range from 98.25% to 101.65%.The estrogenic activity of red clover extract originates from its isoflavones: genistein and diadzein (called soy isoflavons, due to high contents in soy products), and two structurally similar, methylated isoflavons, biochanin A and formononetin. In fact, Biochanin A is methylated genistein, and formononetin methylated daidzein, so after oral application and demethylation in the digestive tract, only genistein and daidzein are found as active metabolites in the organism (Toleson et al., 2002). What remains the question is whether demethylation can occur during one of the dry extract production phases, as well as later during storage and sample manipulation. Thus, during the quality assessment of the extract, the ratio between individual isoflavones should be considered. The U.S. Pharmacopoeia, within HPLC identification, sets requirements for quantitative ratio between two 5,7-dihydroxyisoflavones (biochanin A and genistein) and two 7-hydroxyisoflavones, to be between 0.1 and 10.0.The information collected, concerning the quality of world renowned brands used in clinical research and available in electronic databases indicate that in these products more than 75% of total isoflavone content comes from biochanin A and formononetin, while soy isoflavons (genistein and daidzein) represent a significantly smaller percentage:* Promensil(r) capsule, 43.5 mg: biochanin A 26 mg (60%), formononetin 16 mg (37%), genistein 1 mg (2%) and daidzein 0.5 mg (1%) (Knight et al., 1999)* Rimostil(r) capsule, 28.6 mg: formononetin 27 mg (87%), biochanin A 2 mg (7%), genistein and daidzein in trace amounts (Schult et al., 2004)When all is considered, the ratio of peaks from the chromatogram could indicate a possible attempt to falsi-fy the extract. It is preferable for the peaks of formonone-tin and biochanin A to stand out in relation to ones coming from genistein and daidzein.ConclusionTest sample I contains satisfactory levels of formononetin and biochanin, but low total isoflavone content (< 40%).Test samples II and III comply with requirements for total isoflavone content (> 40%), but high levels of genistein and daidzein can indicate that the extracts were not pure red clover.Requirements for the ratio between pairs of related isoflavones (B + G / D + F) were met by all of the extract samples, in accordance with USP/NF31 (0.1 to 10.0).The total isoflavone content results in samples taken from different positions of the bulk package show no statistically significant difference (RSD < 2 and recovery < +- 3%), which confirms the homogeneity of the tested extract.

Only few species produce essential oil (glandular goosefoots) usu-ally with characteristic chemical composition. In Europe, glandular goosefoot is Chenopodium botrys L. (syn. Dys-phania botrys (L.) Mosyakin and Clemants) known as Je-rusalem Oak Goosefoot, native to the Mediterranean re-gion. The plant has been used for treatment of catarrh and humoral asthma and is known as a good substitute for the traditionally known medicinal plant Chenopodium ambro-sioides (Yadav et al., 2007). C. botrys contains flavonoids, alkaloids and terpe-noids. The characteristic odor of the plant is due to some monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes which were found to be responsible for the specific aromatic and fetid scent. The presence of some oxygen-containing sesquiterpenes was correlated with pronounced antibacterial and antifungal activity (Kokanova-Nedialkova et al., 2009). Studies on the flavonoids revealed presence of flavonols: chrysoeriol, quercetin, kaempferol and herbacetin and flavones: hispid-ulin, salvigenin, 5-methylsalvigenin, 7-methyleupatulin, sinensetin and jaceosidin (Morteza-Semnani, 2015). Dried herbal part of C. botrys is used from local peo-ple in Republic of Macedonia (RM) for preparing infusions or liquid extracts with diuretic, antispasmodic, carminative and antidiarrheal properties. The aim of this study was de-termination of the chemical composition of Macedonian C. botrys and evaluation of its antimicrobial capacity.Materials and methodsThe aerial flowering parts (herba) of C. botrys, were collected in the period from July to September in 2012, 2013 and 2014 from five localities in RM: 1. Kozuf, 2. Pretor, 3. Strumica, 4. Zletovo and 5. Radovish. Collect-ed plant material was air-dried and preserved in paper bags until analysis, when it was minced and homogenised ap-propriately.The essential oil was isolated with steam distillation using all-glass Clevenger type apparatus according to the method listed in the monograph in the European pharma-copoeia. Essential oil samples were analysed on Agilent 7890A Gas Chromatography system equipped with FID detector and Agilent 5975C Mass Quadrupole detector using previ-ously published method (Adji Andov et al., 2014). Hydrolyzed extract of C. botrys herba was prepared according to the method listed in the monograph in the Eu-ropean pharmacopoeia and were analyzed using an Agile-nt 1200 series HPLC system equipped with a G1315D pho-to-diode array detector, controlled by ChemStation LC 3D software. Chromatographic separations were carried out on a XDB-C18 Eclipse column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mm, Ag-ilent Technologies, USA). Spectral data for all peaks were accumulated in the range of 190-400 nm and chromato-grams were recorded at 260, 280, 330 and 370 nm. Antimicrobial activity. Microbial strains: Staphylococ-cus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Candida albicans ATCC 10259 and clinical isolates from patients (Enterococcus, Strepto-coccus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enteriti-S5 PP 237498Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 497 - 498 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsdis) were used. Method: Disc diffusion method was used in order to determine the growth inhibition zones of the mi-croorganisms. The results were compared to the antimicro-bial activity of several antibiotic drugs. Preparation of ex-tracts: methanol extracts (1 g/mL) were prepared using ul-trasonic assisted extraction procedure. Results and discussionThe results of the GC/FID/MS analysis showed that the main compounds of the essential oil of C. botrys herba were the sesquiterpenes: elemol acetate, saline-11-en-4a-ol, selina-3,11-diene-6a-ol and elemol, followed by low-er content of a-eudesmol acetate, a-henopodiol, botrydiol and a-chenopodiol-6-acetate. These compounds represent-ed 62.74-81.21% of the oil. Additionally more than 50 oth-er compounds were identified in very low quantities or in traces. The monoterpene ascaridol was absent. In hydrolyzed extract of C. botrys herba, hydroxycin-namic acid, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid and its de-rivate were identified together with quercetin and isorh-amnetin. Tentatively apigenin and luteolin were identified, based on comparison of the Rt and UV-DAD spectra with those of the authentic substances of apigenin and luteolin, used as referent flavonoids. The component that appeared in the HPLC chromatogram on Rt 24.7 min has UV-DAD spectra with UVmax on 348 nm and was assume to be her-bacetin.Methanol extracts of C. botrys herba showed promis-ing antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, and no activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella en-teritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Additionally the extract showed promising antifungal ac-tivity against Candida albicans. Obtained results are in ac-cordance with the literature data. The essential oil isolated from C. botrys from differ-ent regions in the world contains varying chemical compo-sition where dominant components are the sesquiterpenes, mainly a- and b-chenopodiol, eudesma-3,11-dien-6a-ol, botrydiol, elemol, elemol acetate, a- b- and g-eudesmol and new identified compound guaia-3,9-dien-11-ol, that was also identified in our oil. Some authors point out on higher presence of other sesquiterpenes such as a-cadinol, epi-a-muurolol, cubenol and E-caryophyllene, while some other identified higher percentages of monoterpenes g-terpineol, b-myrcene, p-cymene, a-terpinene, limonene, and espe-cially ascaridole which were reported in essential oils of C. botrys from Spain and Slovakia (Morteza-Semnani, 2015). According Kokanova-Nedialkova et al. (2009) Cheno-podium species contain phenol derivatives such as alco-hols, aldexydes and glycosides (vanillic alcohol and vanil-lic acid, phenolic glycoside named chenoalbuside, cinnam-ic, sinapic and ferulic acid and their derivatives, hydroxy-cinnamic acylglycosides and many other phenolic com-pounds. In the group of flavonoids, quercetin, isorhamne-tin, kaempferol and herbacetin and their glycosides were the only flavonols isolated from Chenopodium species, in-cluding C. botrys, besides highly metylated flavons: salvi-genin, sinensetin, hispidulin and their derivatives. Up to now, antimicrobial activity was tested only on the essential oil of C. botrys, which expressed signifi-cant bactericidal activity against selected strains of Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria, comparable to that of the ref-erence antibiotics amicacin and cephotaxim (Kokanova-Nedialkova et al. 2009) and significant fungicidal activi-ty against selected strains of Aspergillus niger and Candi-da albicans, comparable to that of the reference antibiotics nystatine and amphotericin (Tzakou et al., 2007).ConclusionIn the essential oil chemical composition of Macedo-nian Chenopodium botrys as predominant compounds were determinate the oxygen-containing sesquiterpenes: elemol, eudesmol, chenopodiol and seline alcohols and their esters. The hydrolysed extract contained few phenolic acids, pre-dominantly, cinnamic and caffeic acid and their derivates and quercetin, isorhamnetin, apigenin, luteolin and proba-bly herbacetin. Methanol extracts show promising antimi-crobial and antifungal activity. Further investigations are required for complete chemical identification of phenolic and flavonoid compounds as well as to reveal the antimi-crobial and antifungal capacity of the plant extract, for fur-ther medicinal or commercial use.ReferencesAdji Andov, L., Karapandzova, M., Cvetkovikj, I., Stefkov, G., Kulevanova, S., 2014.
