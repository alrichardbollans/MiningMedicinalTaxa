Sharifuddin 2008SUMMARYIn this thesis, the genotoxic potential of andrographolide, which is a primary phytochemical of an annual herb Andrographis paniculata, was assessed and the possible mechanisms of action were elucidated.In silico predictions showed that andrographolide may be capable of inducing skin sensitisation and chromosome damage in mammals in vitro and the identification of possible metabolites.Andrographolide was demonstrated to induce micronuclei formation in vitro in three cell lines tested namely AHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79. In AHH-1 and V-79 cell lines, the highest frequency of micronuclei was recorded at 30 pM whereas in MCL-5 cell line, 50 pM of the compound was necessary to elicit similar damage, which may be due differences in cellular metabolism capacity. The phytochemical was shown to cause dose-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in all the cell lines tested with cells dying primarily via necrosis compared to apoptosis and effectively reduced cell number.Kinetochore labelling on MCL-5 cells challenged with increasing doses of andrographolide revealed that the phytochemical acts in aneugenic manner evident from the increment in kinetochore-positive micronuclei.The compound of interest was also found to disrupt segregation fidelity via centrosome amplification resulting in chromosomal aberration. The presence of extra microtubule organising centres may play a role in the promotion of aberrant mitoses. Disruption to normal cell division was observed even after the removal of the compound in vitro.Mammalian HPRT point mutation assay using AHH-1 cell line revealed that andrographolide induced mutation evident from HPRT~ mutant colonies formation between 5pM and 30pM. The phytochemical was also found to exert cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner between 1 pM and 50pM.Thus, andrographolide is capable of disrupting normal mammalian cell division and causing dose-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro.VIY.

Traditional medicines are still widely used in developing countries and are increasingly popular in developed countries. In certain parts of the world, it is the only geographically accessible and economically feasible mode of healthcare. Globally the public, health professionals and policy-makers are wrestling with the questions about the quality, efficacy, safety, preservation and further development of this type of health care. This thesis is focusing on herbal applications in traditional medicine and highlighting the need to ensure safe application of medicines derived from plants.Modem pharmaceutical dmgs are based on chemicals with active properties and many drugs used today have been discovered through research into the physiological effects of phytochemicals, which are chemicals derived from plant sources. The primacy of plants as the source of new drug discoveries throughout human civilisation remained unrivalled until the recent competition from combinatorial chemistry (Schreiber, 2000) and computational drug design (Clark and Pickett, 2000), which effectively reduced its influence in dmgthdiscovery process. During the 20 century especially since the Industrial Revolution, efforts gradually shifted from producing medicinal plant extracts to synthetically producing these phytochemicals or their active analogues. Figure 1.1 highlights the factors that contribute to the decline of natural products in drug discovery and development. Although many can now be synthesised, such as aspirin, which is a safer analogue of salicylic acid derived from Salix alba, some of these dmgs are still derived directly from plants (e.g.Copy 1 10(c)s(U00cd0 --- 2 d>>'J j i (fi 5O 2 C3 y:n P w>-- 1 r * c \/ iC3 ^ SO c\/500 H * =# JPS^ S' i . ^o deg c.2 & y c5EQ ._ o<U>0>T3~oCCd>Oo. a'- 3ooPS PS c 2 3 .2 * - > ' PS G -5 c -- c u.^ ' o OCJ <+C'I - a s.2 * PSCQ \"5 -2> co o S~D C<U &H deg.

SharifuddinChapter 1digitalin from foxglove, Digitalis sp.). Chemicals in some plants are extracted and transformed, providing the building blocks of drugs (e.g. progesterone, synthesised from chemicals found in some species of wild yam, Dioscorea sp.). Generally, phytochemicals are referred to as new chemical entities (NCEs) especially in the industry circle and viewed as templates for structure optimisation in making perfect new drugs. Other compounds are potentially useful to humans or are of toxicological relevance.Although synthetic chemistry is currently more appealing as an approach to produce new drugs, flora's contribution in preventing and treating diseases cannot be ignored. At the beginning of the 21st century, it was reported that 11% of the 252 drugs regarded as vital by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and about 25% of drugs prescribed worldwide were solely derived from plants (Rates, 2001). Furthermore, 49% of 877 new chemical entities introduced between 1981 and 2002 were natural products, semi-synthetic natural products or mimics based on natural-products (Newman et al., 2003). As shown in Figure 1.2, there was an increasing trend in natural product patents worldwide whereas Table 1.1 lists the percentage of identified medicinal plant species in selected countries and the world in general.400-1Cl*PS 20: -1 0 0 -# Total woHdwide natural-product patents [H Original natural-product patentsT384 1985 1986 1997 1 998 1939 1993 1991 1992 1933 1994 1 935 1 936 1997 1993 1999 2*000 2C01 2002 20C6Fig 1.2. Worldwide pharmaceutical natural product patents. Original natural product patents refer to all firsttime grants o f patents for novel composition o f small molecule natural products as pharmaceuticals. Whereas those for total worldwide natural products are global grants for patents asserting composition-of-matter or small natural products applications as therapeutics. One single natural product can generate several patents based on multiple filings in different countries or for different indications. (Adopted from Koehn & Carter,2005. )Copy I3Y.

This is especially true in areas where there are insufficient synthetic leads. Furthermore, plants have utilised a more holistic tactic in their biochemical defence against pathogens by producing arrays of structurally and functionally diverse anti- pathogenic compounds that act in concert, not only to neutralise the threat but also in averting the development o f resistance in the future. For example, Berheris fremontii (Fremont barberry) produces both anti-microbial berberine alkaloid and inhibitors of a bacterial pump that strongly potentiate the activity of berberines (Hsiang & Lewis, 2000). It is for the same reason that made herbal medicines appealing not only to the scientific community but also to the public, where multi-factorial nature of many complex diseases such as psychiatric disorders and cancers cannot be ideally solve with a 'single golden molecular bullet'. Most of these diseases are not a result o f one single factor but from a combination of genetic, behavioural and environmental influences. Furthermore, many proteins and molecular targets are involved in complex biochemical and cellular processes. Thus, carelessly tampering with one reaction might affect the others.Pharmacognosy (derived from Greek words pharmakon, 'remedy', and gignosco, 'knowledge') is the science of biogenic or nature-derived pharmaceuticals and poisons. It concerns all medicinal plants including those yielding complex mixtures, those used in the crude forms or extracts (phytotherapy), pure compounds such as morphine, and foods having additional health benefits (nutraceuticals). Phytomedicines generally refer to herbal medicinal products used in phytotherapy. Phytotherapy should not be confused with other \"special therapeutic disciplines\" that also utilise plant materials such as anthroposophy and homeopathy. Homeopathy, whose efficacy is still being critically assessed, was proposed by Samuel Hahnemann and works on the principle o f 'similia similibus curentur'- similarCopy I4Y. SharifuddinChapter Isymptoms are healed by similar medicines. Furthermore, homeopathy mainly involves really low doses where 'efficacy' is believed to increase with dilutions, in stark contrast to current scientific comprehension.There are various ways in which plants can be used as therapeutics as listed in Table 1.2.Herbal teas and other homemade remedies are very popular. Crude or standardised extracts can be prepared in pills or capsules and can also be use as tinctures. Ultimately, as mentioned briefly before, successive extraction and purification procedures to isolate phytochemicals from plants of interests, that is bioactive and can be used straight away as drugs (e.g. ergotamine and digoxin) or use as leads in hemisynthetic processes.Table 1.2. A variety o f ways in which phytochemicals can be used.Drugs Primarily single active pharmaceutical compounds originating from plants.Via prescription orover-the-counterpurchases.Aspirin, vinblastine and taxol.Botanical drugs Standardised phytochemical mixtures that are clinically proven.Via prescription orover-the-counterpurchases.Hypericumperforatum.DietarysupplementsA plant component with health benefits.Over-the counter purchases.Garlic or Echinacea extract.Phytochemicals can also be use as reference models for total synthesis with well-defined pharmacological activity or structure activity relationship studies determining a prototype drug (e.g. morphine). One good example would be artemisinin. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene trioxane lactone containing a peroxide bridge that is necessary for its activity, was first isolated by Chinese researchers from Artemisia annua (sweet wormwood) and its structure was elucidated in 1979 (Klayman, 1985). Various soluble and more active forms o f artemisinin have been synthesised to combat malaria. The phytochemical and its derivatives kills Plasmodium in all stages o f life cycle by interacting with heme resulting in carbon-centred free radicals, which alkylate protein thus damaging the membrane and microorganelles o f the parasites (Meshnick, 1998). Up to this day and to the best of the author's knowledge, there are no known cases of artemisinin-resistant malaria in humansCopy 1 5Y. SharifuddinChapter 1(Balint, 2001). Figure 1.3 highlights the evolution of Artemisia annua application starting with traditional medicine to modem drug discovery and Figure 1.4 shows the similar passage of the senna plant. The variety of development and use of natural products is shown in Figure 1.5.1.2 Increasing Public Interest in Phytomedicines and PhytotherapyIt is widely accepted that there is an increasing use of phytomedicines by the general public to replace or complement allopathic medicines (Newall et al., 1996). This revival of interest in phytomedicines is largely driven by the public's increasing interest and confidence in self-medication (Blenkinsopp and Bradley, 1996). There are many reasons for the increasing popularity of phytotherapy and most likely to include the following:* Increasing consumer interest in self-medication. * Increasing consumer interest in using herbal remedies as daily supplements. * As a complementary to allopathic medicine. * The popular notion that phytomedicines are safe and natural. * Growing concern about the adverse effects of synthetic dmgs. * Disappointment with the efficacy of conventional dmgs, especially in chronic conditions. * The desire for a more natural lifestyle. * Cost factor. Herbal medications are normally available over the counter and are cheaper than prescribed modem dmgs.The world market for phytomedicines is estimated to be PS38 billion (UNCTAD, 2000). It is estimated that Europe imports about 400,000 tonnes of medicinal plants annually with Germany as the largest market and consumer of medicinal plants, spending about PS1.4 billion, followed by France with PS116 million (Masood, 1997). The UK is third in place.As highlighted in the House of Lords Select Committee's report on complementary and alternative medicine, comprehensive information on the use of herbal medicines in the UK is insufficient (House of Lords, 2000). There are several estimates available but it is difficult to make an accurate determination as many products could be categorised as foodCopy 1 600 <N1I<3*>55*= O>

SharifuddinChapter 1supplements rather than medicines mainly for regulatory purposes, effectively the public in many cases are unable to differentiate phytomedicines for dietary supplements or therapeutic applications. A report by the Mintel market research group on retail sales of licensed homeopathic, herbal remedies and essential oils showed that phytomedicines make up more than 50% of the total complementary market in the United Kingdom with estimated value of PS38 million in 1996 compared to PS27.2 million in 1991 (Mintel, 1997). However, the total market value is likely to be higher since the study excluded ginkgo and unlicensed herbal products from its analysis.Another report estimated the phytomedicines market to be over PS60 million (Mintel, 2000).More recent reports estimated the market value of herbal remedies (excluding traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines) had grown to PS75 million in 2002, dominating the UK natural health market and accounting for almost 60% of the sector value (Mintel, 2003).Another Mintel report in 2005 noted that herbal medicines have shown greatest growth over the last two years with value sales hitting PS87 million in 2004, accounting for half of overall category sales. All these estimates should be considered as broad brush since some companies might not always have an accurate view as to which of their products would be classified as medicines.The analysis of the market structure for unlicensed phytomedicines is complicated by several factors such as:* Most phytomedicines possess borderline status as to whether they should be categorised as medicines or fall within other regulatory classification such as supplements, cosmetics or general consumer products. * A number of companies supply herbal ingredients (e.g. for herbalists' use or by manufacturers) rather than manufacture the product themselves. * Under existing regulations, companies are not required to submit products to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for determining their status.One must recognised the fact that future growth in the industry remains vulnerable to adverse publicity arising from issues over the safety and quality of phytomedicines.Copy 1 10Y. SharifuddinChapter 11.3 The Regulation of Phytomedicines in the United Kingdom and the European UnionThe House of Lord's Select Committee on Science and Technology 6th report (2000) stressed for a need of a more effective guidance to the public regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicines. The absence of central information provision for healthcare practitioners and the general public, effectively gave the media and other unregulated information sources unchecked influence in shaping opinions in the field. Over 25% of consumers believed that pharmacists should provide more information on herbal medicines highlighting increasing consumer concern, with about 20% of consumers worried about the possible side-effects from alternative medications (Mintel, 2003).Whilst the government and the industry need to address this consumer concern, Mintel's report also found that around 1 in 5 UK consumers worry about the possible side effects from standard medication too. And 18% admitted they have tried conventional medicine which did not work, suggesting a significant opening for the phytomedicine industry (Mintel, 2003).Phytomedicines intended for general retail sale reach the UK market by two different routes. First, an authorisation can be obtained from the licensing authority for marketing purposes under the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisation Use) Regulations 1994 (SI3144\/1994) that fundamentally transposed European Directive 2001\/83\/EC into UK law. Under these Regulations, authorisation is requisite for most industrially produced medicines that are to be marketed. Such authorisation is obtained by providing standards of quality, efficacy and safety.Alternatively, exemption from product licence requirement (compulsory under the Medicines Act) can be obtained under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 [and regulation 1(3) of the 1994 Regulations] for phytomedicines that do not need marketing authorisation, providing that the remedy meets various conditions. There are restrictions or prohibitions on certain ingredients, but generally there are no specific requirements for quality, safety and efficacy. Written medical claims are not permitted for these herbal remedies and specific requirement to provide the consumers with systematic information about the safe application of the product is absent.Copy 1 11Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Even though several hundred phytomedicines posses marketing permission in the UK, most herbal medicines were marketed on general sale by utilising the exemption provided in Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act as explained above.The primary piece of European legislation is Directive 2001 \/83\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code regarding medicinal products intended for human use. Thus, there was no distinction in the European legislation for medicines made from non-herbal ingredients and phytomedicine. Medicinal products are also subjected to some non-specific legislation, such as Directive 85\/374\/EEC on product viability, which was transposed into the UK law as Consumer Protection Act 1987 and applies in part to medicinal products for consumer protection.On 30th October 2005, the MHRA introduced a new scheme, the Traditional Herbal Medicines Registration Scheme implemented through the Medicines (Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2005 (SI 2005 No. 2750), which is required by the European Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products 2004\/24\/EC. This scheme will assist in protecting public health, consumer confidence and the industry itself by requiring specific standards to be met relating to the product namely quality, safety, manufacturing standards, patient information, wholesale and import. However, the key feature of this scheme is the requirement for evidence of traditional application in the EU for 30 years. Evidence for up to 15 years of traditional applications outside the Union is admissible. This new EU Directive effectively amends Directive 2001\/83\/EC, to introduce the scheme and applies many existing requirements of the later to traditional herbal medicinal products. Another separate new EU Directive 2004\/27\/EC is simultaneously amending Directive 2001\/83\/EC. All manufactured traditional herbal medicines that marketed with exemption under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act, will be required to be registered under this new scheme.However, for unlicensed herbal medicines that were legally on the market by 30 April 2004, Her Majesty's Government has opted for a seven-year transitional period that ends on 30 April 2011, a flexibility accorded to EU member States under Directive 2004\/24\/EC intended to allow companies to adjust to the new regulations.Copy 1 12Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Herbal products that are not classified as medicines are still subject to other regulations. The fact that a product is not medicinal in nature thus not necessarily means that it is safe or acceptable from a legal standpoint. Food and supplements are regulated by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) while cosmetics or other consumer products fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Industry. The MHRA accepts no responsibilities on these points. The Food Safety Act (1990) states that food sold in the United Kingdom cannot be injurious to health and according to the FSA, herbal ingredients that do not possess a history of significant consumption within the European Union prior to May 1997 may be subject to Novel Food Regulation (EC) 258\/97.1.4 The Importance of Natural Products and PhytomedicinesNatural products have enjoyed an undisputedly important role as new chemical entities (NCEs). Between the years 1981 and 2002, approximately 28% of NCEs were natural products or derived from natural products, with another 20% were considered as synthetics based on natural product pharmacophores (Newman et al., 2003).Natural products (phytochemicals) have many common structural features such as chiral centres, degree of molecule saturation, complex ring systems and aromatic rings that have been demonstrated to be highly applicable in drug discovery process (Koehn & Carter, 2005). Furthermore, the realisation that combinatorial chemistry may not always provide high degree of compound diversity led to the exploration of combining the natural product and natural product-like libraries with the potential of combinatorial chemistry in drug discovery and Table 1.3 shows some of the well-known phytochemicals in use today.The existence and application of new technologies such as combinatorial synthesis, genomics and screening technology allow new research and development strategies to be adopted and contributed to revival of interest in phytochemicals. Table 1.4 listed some phytochemicals with their known molecular targets which might pave the way for better comprehension on their mode of action(s) and possible development into clinically applicable drugs.Copy 1 13Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Table 1.3.

In May 2007, another pharmaceutical heavyweight, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) announced the establishment of its own drug research and development facility in Shanghai, China (Corporate Press Releases,Copy I1 4Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Novartis and GSK respectively, 2007). Embracing phytochemicals again and re-designing strategies for discovering new molecules from plants including studying those described in traditional medicine texts such as in China, is understandable since the new chemical entities pipeline of pharmaceutical companies were reported to be at historically low levels (Bolten & DeGregorio, 2002).1.5 The Efficacy of PhytomedicinesThe extraordinary level of phytomedicines popularity in recent years made it ethically imperative to elucidate its efficacy. There were opinions that the criteria for efficacy as well as safety of herbal medicines should be on par as those for conventional medicines and the author concur with these views. Many phytomedicines possess a long history of traditional use but most are of unproven efficacy by acceptable scientific standards, and traditional use does not necessarily confer safety usage mark. Insufficient evidence does not mean that phyomedicines are unsafe and ineffective, but that rigorous scientific investigation has not been carried out. Base on the same line of argument, the lack of evidence cannot be use to justify that all phytomedicines are safe.The accepted 'gold standard' for testing the efficacy of medicines, whether it is synthetic or herbal, is the randomised clinical trials. Depending on the research objectives, these trials can be conducted against reference medications should one exists, or against placebo or no treatment at all. There is good evidence of efficacy for some phytomedicines but usually such an evaluation is scientifically inadequate. Figure 1.6 shows the percentage of randomised clinical trials highlighting the benefit of phytomedicines based on 50 trials with 10 herbal medicines for 18 therapeutic indications, where only 34% exhibited benefit when compared against placebo and 18% showed the same activity as placebo. Almost half (48%) of the results from the trials has an unlikely benefit due to discrepancies in experimental design or data analysis.Copy 7 15Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Percentage of randomised trials showing benefit of phytomedicines# Same as compared to placebo # Benefit as compared to placebo# Benefit reported unlikely - due to design or analytic flawFig. 1.6. Percentage o f randomised trials showing benefit o f phytomedicines. Based on data in Herbal Medicines: an evidence-based look. (Therapeutics Letter, Issue 25, June-July 1998. )However, in order to provide a fair estimate of overall efficacy of a particular herbal medication, relying on the data generated from randomised trials alone is not sufficient. Only the totality of the available data that can be achieved by performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses can provide the most reliable evidence while minimising bias and random error. Determining the efficacy of an herbal product against its safety is important.1.6 Safety of Phytomedicines: Clear and Hidden RisksThe advances in organic chemistry, biological and medical sciences in the 20th century had paved the way for the introduction and consumption of powerful synthetic drugs, resulting in the decline of phytomedicines usage in modern medicine. However, the current revival of interest in phytotherapy had caused the pharmaceutical industry to start marketing an increasing amount o f new phytomedicines to accommodate the needs o f consumers. This makes the need to ensure the quality, efficacy and safety of phytomedicines even more pressing since these products are generally self-prescribed, used to treat minor and oftenCopy \/1 6Y. SharifuddinChapter 1chronic conditions. The assumption that they only possess beneficial effects has proven to be inaccurate.Furthermore, traditional medicines have developed in many different regions, having been very much influenced by historical conditions and local cultures within which they first evolved. Thus, there has been no parallel development of methods and standards, both at national or international level that are suitable for evaluation purposes.Safety evaluation of phytomedicines is difficult. Identifying plants accurately is essential as well as isolation of active ingredients, which is far more complex since the properties of phytochemicals are influenced by several factors such as environmental conditions. A single medicinal plant can also contain hundreds of phytochemicals and elucidating the individual effect of each can therefore be prohibitively expensive. Unsurprisingly, research effort has been inadequate, resulting in inadequate methodology development and paucity of reliable data. Although many phytomedicines showed promising potential and are increasingly used, many of them are untested and their use by the public not properly monitored leading to limited knowledge of their side-effects. Benefit-risk assessment can also be difficult due to insufficient information in several areas relevant to safety."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:11:47.560457Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T11:40:25.065700Z","inner_id":3,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":4,"annotations":[{"id":4,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":1922,"end":1939,"text":"anti-inflammatory","labels":["Medicinal

proper development of legislation and regulation of herbal medicines has been impaired at the public expense.Generally, data are currently lacking on:* The active constituents and\/or metabolites* Pharmacology* Pharmacokinetics* Toxicology* Possibilities of drug-herb interactions, as well as interactions with food and alcohol* Frequency of possible adverse effects, and effects of long term use* Possible effects in specific patient groups e.g. children, the elderly* Possible effects for use during pregnancy and lactationCopy 1 17Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Insufficient data on the factors stated above also makes it hard to compare and contrast the risk-benefit profile of several phytomedicines with that of conventional drugs, where effectiveness has been reported.Toxicity related to the use of phytomedicines may have multiple causes but generally can be divided into two distinguishable categories as highlighted in Tables 1.5 and 1.6 respectively. The first category can be designated as extrinsic or non-plant associated, where toxic effects or adverse reactions occurred due to accidental or deliberate substitution or contamination of the plant material described on the label. On the other hand, the second category is more intrinsic or plant-associated in nature. In this category, the plant material itself or the phytochemicals present, thus an active agent in the herbal medicinal products, which causes the health risks.Table 1.5. Extrinsic or non-plant-associated causative factors involved in adverse drug reactions.Adulteration* Accidental or deliberate substitution of the original plant material by other plant speciesContamination* Micro-organisms (bacteria including Salmonella, E.coli, yeasts, moulds)* Microbial toxins (aflatoxins, lipopolysaccharides)* Heavy metals (mercury, lead, etc. )* Pesticides and\/or herbicides* Fumigants* Radioactive particlesSubstitution* Synthetic drugs (anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids etc. )* Animal substances (enzymes, hormones etc. )Copy 1 18Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Table 1.6. Intrinsic or plant-associated causative factors; health risks related to the medicinal herb itself as active ingredient in the phytomedicine. * Use of plants containing constituents that are known to affect bioavailability and\/or pharmacokinetics of other compounds or drugs* Ignored toxicity of plant constituent(s) present in the product* Use of plants, either as raw material or in processed form, of which at present no or insufficient data regarding safety are available* Use of highly concentrated or specifically processed extractsAlthough the number of side effects attributed to the use of phytomedicines represents only a small proportion of the total amount of adverse drug reactions in the WHO database (Barnes, 1998), reports on toxic effects of or adverse reactions to herbal preparations have regularly been published over the past years (Barnes, 1998). Proponents of phytotherapy usually present long-standing experience in traditional medicine as evidence of their safety, unfortunately this type of evidence has considerable deficiencies. Determining botanicals that contain phytochemicals, which manifest their toxicities and acute adverse effects in a large fraction of users is relatively easy. A 5-year toxicological study by the UK National Poisons Unit from 1991 to 1995 on potentially serious adverse reactions attributed to exposure to herbal remedies, showed there were 785 cases of possible or definitive positive poisoning out of 1297 inquiries (Shaw et al., 1997). Although the study concluded that the overall risk to public health was low, there were clusters of cases that deserve serious attention where there were 21 incidents of hepatotoxicity including two deaths due to the use of traditional medicines although no causative agent was identified.The harder task is recognising subtle adverse effects that develop over time and occur infrequently, for example hypokalemia from the use of anthranoid laxatives (Blumenthal, 1998), or that are readily ascribed to an underlying disease such as hepatitis from celandine, a bile duct remedy derived from Chelidonium majus (Benninger et al., 1999). Hypothetically, for a herb that caused an adverse reaction in 1 for every 1000 users, a traditional practitioner would have to prescribed the herb to 4800 patients, that is 1 new user per day for more than 18 years, in order to obtain a 95% probability of observing such reaction in more than 1 user (De Smet, 1995).Copy 1 19Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Thus, the more chronic but subtle form of toxicity such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity effects of phytochemicals will remain unrecognised if their applications in traditional settings were left unexamined, as these may have been undetermined by previous generations. For example, although Aristolochia fangchi have been used for centuries in Chinese traditional medicine, its nephrotoxicity and potential to induce urothelial carcinoma by DNA-adduct formation has only recently been elucidated (Nortier|| et al., 2000; Lord et al., 2001) and it was the same case with the hepatotoxicity potential of| Piper methysticum (Escher et al., 2001). !IfFurthermore, there is always a belief among the general public that herbal medicines orj supplements are safe primarily because they are derived from nature, compared to syntheticj| compounds. Therefore, it was often considered harmless by the public that the consumption of these herbal products would not cause profound injury directly or vice-versa. Herb-drugs interactions for example, can occur at the pharmaceutical, pharmacodynamic and\/or pharmacokinetic levels (Beijnen & Schellens, 2004). The application of herbal medicines in combination with conventional therapeutics may increase the risk for undesired interactions primarily due to the narrow therapeutic window of many oncolytic drugs.| Alarmingly, more than 72% of cancer patients in the US for example, failed to inform theirij doctors about herbal products consumption when undergoing conventional therapy at the| same time (Sparreboom et al., 2004). One of the well-known examples of a clinicallysignificant effect displayed by herbs on the pharmacokinetic of chemotherapeutic drugs is Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort), which is popular among cancer patients due to its suggested activity on mild to moderate levels of depression (Mathijssen et al., 2002). The plasma levels of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan was 42% lower in cancer patients who took Hypericum at the same time. Co-administration of cyclosporin with Hypericum leads to decrease cyclosporin plasma concentration (Barone et al., 2000) and disrupts hormonal contraception with irregular bleeding when taken together with ethynylestradiol (Schwarz et al., 2003). Even the innocently looking grapefruit (iCitrus paradisi) juice, has been shown to caused 26.2% reduction in etoposide bioavailability (Reif et al., 2002) and the culprit is bergamottin, a major furanocoumarin that reversibly inhibited the activities of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 in human liver microsomes (He et al., 1998), which may last up to 24 hours. It also alters the concentration of many drug substrates for CYP3A4 when taken simultaneously (Quo et al.,2000). These examples highlight the need for more research not only into direct detrimentalCopy 1 20Y. Sharifuddinj Chapter 1effects pose by phytochemicals but also indirect effects or impacts that are not clearly manifested including mutations and metabolic enzymes manipulation. The public may not | be aware of these hidden risks due to the 'naturally safe' paradigm long held about herbaliproducts.Although phytomedicines are not devoid of risk, they could still be safer than synthetic drugs. Currently, the relative safety of phytomedicines is undefinable, many existing data indicate that adverse reactions, especially serious ones, occur less frequently than with prescribed synthetic drugs. Kava {Piper methysticum), an herbal anxiolytic (Pittler & Ernst,2003) that raised serious concern due to its hepatotoxicity effect, could be safer than benzodiazepines, according to preliminary data (Schulze et al., 2003) and herbal I antidepressant St. John's wort {Hypericum perforatum), has only about half the rate ofI possible adverse reactions compared to conventional antidepressants (Linde et al, 1996;Stevinson & Ernst, 1999). However, its use is only recommended for weak and mild | depression and was found not to be effective for major depression cases compared to| placebo (Linde et al., 1996; Shelton et al., 2001; Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group,i1 2002) The World Health Organization's monitoring centre collected 8985 reports ofj adverse reaction events associated with phytomedicines from 55 countries between 1968! and 1997 (Farah & Edwards, 2000). Even though this figure may seem impressively high,jit amounts to only a small fraction of adverse events associated with synthetic drugs held in I the same database (Farah & Edwards, 2000). However, one must recognise the fact thatrelative paucity could also be due to a relatively higher level of underreporting due to the perceived safety of natural herbs among the general population and more conclusive evidence on the relative safety risks of phytomedicines against conventional drugs is scarce.Copy I 21Y. SharifuddinChapter 11.7 Plants and Secondary MetabolitesAs briefly stated before, plants have evolved various defence mechanisms including chemical, mechanical or even mimicry to improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivory and infection. Over billions of years of evolution, plants continually produce the necessary metabolites to out-manoeuvre pathogens in their local environment or to repel herbivores. If the metabolites were useful to the plant, the biosynthetic genes were retained, with subsequent genetic modifications and improving the I process yielding exotic structures rich in functional groups and stereochemistry. Chemicalidefence involved the production of organic compounds that are not essential to metabolic, photosynthetic or other physiologically crucial activities and are known as secondary metabolites. They are usually synthesised as by-products during the production of primary metabolic process and play a major role in deterring herbivores.Plants have developed various secondary metabolites and can generally be classified into three sub-groups namely nitrogen compounds (including alkaloids and glucosinolates), terpenes and phenolics.1.8 Brief Introduction to Andrographis paniculateAndrographis paniculata is a shrub that is found throughout tropical and sub-tropical Asia | and is locally known in Malaysia as 'Hempedu bumi' and 'Akar cerita bidara'. This herbaceous, annual herb is from the family Acanthaceae with a slightly, characteristic odour and an intensely bitter taste, hence commonly known as 'king of bitter'. Pictures of various parts of the plant is shown in Figure 1.7 and Table 1.7 shows the systematic position of Andrographis paniculata.Copy 1 22Y. SharifuddinChapter IFig. 1.7.

Systematic position of A. paniculataAngiospermsDicotyledonaeGamopetalaeBicarpellataePersonalesJusticieaeAcanthaceaeAndrographispaniculataCopy I2 3Y. SharifuddinChapter IThe aerial part of the herb contains several diterpenoids and diterpene glycosides especially andrographolide, a major constituent which is not less than 6% of the total diterpene lactones present and is mainly responsible for its bitter taste. Other diterpene lactones present free and in glycosidic forms include 14-deoxyandrographolide, 14-deoxy-l 1,12- didehydroandrographolide, neoandrographolide, andrographiside, deoxyandrographiside and andropanoside (Kleipool, 1952). Table 1.8 listed the reported medical properties of andrographolide or extracts obtained from the herb.Table 1.8.

Rahman et al., 1999.Coon and Ernst (2004) conducted a systematic review on the safety and efficacy of Andrographis paniculata in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. It was found that the data collectively showed that A. paniculata is superior to placebo in alleviating the subjective symptoms of uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection. The authors also found a few spontaneous reports of adverse events and A. paniculata may be a safe and efficacious treatment for the relief of symptoms of uncomplicated upper tract infection but more research is warranted. However, there were several shortcomings of the review that need to be addressed (Coon & Ernst, 2004).Copy I2 4Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Fig. 1.8. The chemical structure of andrographolide with numbered carbon positions.1.9 The Compound of Interest: Andrographolide[ Andrographolide (CAS no: 5508-58-7) with IUPAC designation 3-{2-[decahydro-6-|I hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,8a-dimethyl-2-methylene-l-napthalenyl]-ethylidene}dihydro-4-hydroxy-2(3H)-furanone is the major bioactive constituent found in various parts of Andrographis paniculata particularly in the leaves. It is a labdane diterpene harbouring a y- lactone ring attached to a decahydronapthalene ring system via an unsaturated C-2 moiety. As shown above in Figure 1.8, it contains an a-alkylidene y-butyrolactone moiety as well as three hydroxyl groups located at C-3, C-14 and C-19 with these being secondary, allylic and primary respectively. These hydroxyls are responsible for the bioactivities of andrographolide (Nanduri et al., 2004). The stereochemistry of this phytochemical has been previously elucidated with the furan ring adopting an envelope conformation whereas the twoj bicyclic rings adopt a chair conformation (Smith et al., 1982; Fujita et al., 1984; Spek et al.,I 1987). Andrographolide was considered to be the most active constituent present in A.; paniculata extract (Kumar et al., 2004; Nanduri et al., 2004)Terpenes are ubiquitous in nature and occur in most species including humans and are sometimes referred to as isoprenes due to a common repetitive structural motif, the branched5-carbon (C5) unit or isopentane skeleton that is comparable to isoprene. They are a good example of a class of natural compound where many members are chiral, structurally diverse and have many functional group chemistry. Terpenes contribute to many of the aromas associated with plants and range in complexity from C5 units to polyisoprenes that includes leaf waxes, latex and rubber. This class of compounds are derived from a number of extensive reactions between two C5 units namely dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) whose chemical structures are depicted in Figure 1.9. Thus,Copy 1 25Y. Sharifuddinj Chapter 1the products of these reactions shall possess multiples of five carbons (C5). DMAPP and IPP1 are biosynthesised from two sources, either deoxyxylulose phosphate or mevalonic acid.I| (a) (b) (c); Fig. 1.9. Chemical structure of (a) isoprene, (b) dimethylalyll pyrophosphate and (c) isopentenyl pyrophosphate.The simplest of terpenes are hemiterpenes (C5) produced by modification reactions to either ; IPP or DMAPP and include simple acids such as angelic acid and tiglic acid, which are i structural isomers and form esters with many natural products. The complexity of structure | then progresses to monoterpenes with 10-carbon skeleton (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15),jj diterpenes (C20), triterpenes and steroids (C3o-derived) and tetraterpenes (C40, also known as 1 carotenoids).j| Diterpenes are widely distributed in plant resins and latex, some can be quite toxic. The|i presence of diterpenes in Rhododendron sp. leaves rendered them poisoinous. Diterpenes are|formed by the reaction of a 15-carbon chain, famesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) with IPP, which is the common basic unit of all terpenes with the first step of this reaction yields famesyl j allylic cation. This cation then reacts with IPP causing stereospecific loss of a proton forming I geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:11:47.561499Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T12:34:04.212843Z","inner_id":4,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":5,"annotations":[{"id":5,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":830,"end":840,"text":"anticancer","labels":["Medicinal

(Diagram obtained from the Sloan-Kettering Institute official website accessible via www.mskcc.org).High purity andrographolide which is easily obtained commercially was chosen for this study rather than extract from the plant itself. Furthermore, of all phytochemical components identified from A. paniculata, andrographolide was shown to be the most active (Kumar et al., 2004; Nanduri et al., 2004)It is estimated that 40% of plants extracts lack reproducibility of activity (Cordell, 2000) and this is one of the primary obstacles in incorporating flora in pharmaceutical discovery process, despite the diversity o f phytochemicals available. The data generated often do not replicate when sampling and extraction procedures were repeated. Different locations, climates, micro-environments, chemical stimuli and physical stresses, known as elicitors, will affect the content of phytochemicals in quantitative and qualitative manner since the biochemical pathways involved in the biosynthesis o f these bioactive compounds are highly inducible. This is especially true for terpenoids, where levels usually increase up to three orders of magnitude following elicitation (Turlings & Tumlinson, 1992; Trapp & Croteau, 2001). Recently, Bhan et al. (2006) showed the production of andrographolide, neo- andrographolide and 14-deoxy andrographolide from 10 different accessions was susceptibleCopy I2 7Y. Sharifuddin| Chapter 1\\\\| to intrinsic factors such as genotype and ontogeny as well as external factors (elicitors),I which supported previous finding by Pholphana et al. (2004). Other compounds that often ! exhibit the same propensity are phenylpropanoids and alkaloids. Furthermore, the presence I of polyphenols and pigments in complex plant extracts can interfere with the activity of j bioactive compounds.Another important factor is the lack of rapid and efficient methods in isolating and characterising phytochemicals, particularly if they are only present in trace amounts. It usually requires almost 6 months isolating and characterising compounds from a plant extract. This does not include the production of standardised extracts. Cultivation and harvesting times will also affect total yield of andrographolide (Polphana et al., 2004; BhaniI et al., 2006) and the fact that A. paniculata is an annual herb must also be taken into account.| Furthermore, only a standardised extract is ideal for experiments. Thus, employing extracts | for experiments within the time limit for this PhD was not feasible.Other argument that can be put forward is that by studying one potentially beneficial phytochemical at a time, in this case andrographolide, more understanding can be gained on | many aspects of that particular bioactive compound, in contrast to working with standardised | extract where the level of qualitative understanding can be limited. Taxol (paclitaxel), anS important diterpene isolated from Taxus (T. bacata and T. brevifolia) which exhibited anti-!| tumour activity, is a good example. The main impediment to its wide clinical use is the ! sourcing of the compound. To obtain 2.5kg of taxol, approximately 12,000 of T. brevifolia ; must be cut down (Wall & Wani, 1996). Thus, an alternative source must be sought, either from hemi-synthetic production or an analogue from other Taxus species. This task would be both scientifically inappropriate and economically unfeasible if the whole extract is examined rather than potentially beneficial individual compounds.On the other side of the coin, isolating an active compound may exclude other pharmacologically relevant phytochemicals. This is particularly true when pharmacological activity is a result of pharmacokinetic influences and\/or pharmacodynamic synergism of more than one bioactive compound. Ginkgolides A, B, C, and M from Ginkgo biloba is a good example.Copy 1 28Y. Sharifuddin| Chapter 1| 1.10 Genotoxicity Information on A. paniculata extracts and AndrographolideIi| Realising the medical potential of A. paniculata, particularly androrapholide which is the I major active compound, genotoxicity testing is crucial. There are no existing genotoxicity | studies published, to the best of the author's knowledge at the time of study, especially | recommended tests for genotoxic potential such as in vitro cytokinesis block micronucleus assay (CBMA). Furthermore, the toxic effects of this plant are not well known.| However, Liu et al. (1990) suggested that the extract of the aerial parts are not mutagenic in vitro. This suggestion is questionable since water extract was used instead of alcohol-based j extract. Most of the experimental pharmacological studies mentioned previously utilised | either alcohol-based or dried extract of the aerial parts or purified andrographolide. Gupta etj| al. (1990,1993) demonstrated that the aqueous extract of the aerial parts was not active iniexerting anti-diarrhoeal activity. Yin et al. (1991) tested the aqueous extract of A. paniculata with the Ames test utilising Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 as well as chromosomal aberration assays in mice did not find a positive result on genotoxicity. However, it must be pointed out that even with plant extracts that yielded positive results, there was noticeable discrepancy in results obtained from the mammalian chromosomal aberration and micronucleus assay with those from the Ames test. Usually, the results obtained from mammalian in vivo tests will outweigh those derived from bacterial test system in vitro. In the study conducted, the coherence between the two was low (Yin et al.,2001). Furthermore, Yin et al. (1991) justified the extraction method employed in the study as to simulate the traditional practice conducted in preparing extract for oral medication. As | has been pointed earlier, aqueous extract of A. paniculata are not ideal for experiment ; because the diterpene lactones such as andrographolide, are sparingly soluble in water compared to methanol or chloroform (O'Neil et al., 2001) therefore reducing the bioavailability of the compound to the target in this case DNA. Thus, aqueous extract of j andrographolide is unable to provide an accurate picture of genotoxicity. Another important | aspect that needs to be considered is the suitability of using bacterial test system such as the Ames test, since the extract of A. paniculata appeared to have antibacterial activity (Singha et j a\/., 2003).A standardised dried extract of A. paniculata did not produce reproductive toxicity in male | Sprague-Dawley rats. There was no sign of testicular toxicity with the treatment of 20, 200II Copy1 29| Y. Sharifuddin| Chapter 1\\and lOOOmg\/kg body weight for 60 days as evaluated by testicular histology, testosterone levels, reproductive organ weight and ultrastructural analysis of Leydig cells (Burgos et al.,1997). However, the paper mainly concentrated on histological evaluation and no observation was made on the possibilities of genotoxicological effects of the compound examined. Furthermore, it is known that testicular histology is subjective and not quantitative in testicular toxicity evaluation. Akbarsha and Murugaian (2000) demonstrated that the treatment of andrographolide to male Wistar albino rats at 25mg and 50mg\/kg body weight for 48 days resulted in decreased sperm counts, immotile spermatozoa with several of them possessing abnormalities, limited number of fully differentiated spermatozoa, the disruption of the seminiferous tubules and seminiferous epithelium as well as vacuolated Sertoli cells.The Leydig cells did not show any pathological change and supported the finding made by Burgos et al. (1997) but there were spermatotoxic effects observed and possible disruption(s) to spermatogenesis.Andrographolide extract did not cause significant reduction in progesterone concentration in pregnant rats and at therapeutic dose, is incapable of inducing progesterone-mediated termination of pregnancy (Panossian et al., 1999). However, the extract of A. paniculata should not be used during pregnancy or lactation due to potential antagonism with endogenous progesterone (Panossian et al., 1999). To the best of the author's knowledge, the teratogenicity effect of the herb has not been evaluated to this date.As a brief summary, Figure 1.11 overleaf illustrated the factors that are involved in the revival of interest in phytomedicines and the imperative needs for more information on their safety and efficacy.Copy I 30Y.

SharifuddinChapter 1CHAPTER 1PART 2: INTRODUCTION TO THE GENETIC TOXICOLOGY IN MAMMALIAN CELLS AND ITS IMPORTANCE1.11 Brief Introduction to Genetic ToxicologyParacelsus first described the 'wasting disease of miners' in 1567 based on his observations in Austrian and other several European mines in the Middle Ages. He later suggested that the exposure to realgar (arsenic sulphide) and other natural ores might have been the culprit in causing this condition, which is today known as cancer. Although this type of cancer was eventually attributed to radioactivity emitted from decay products of radon gas rather than arsenic, Paracelsus was among the first to consider chemical compounds as potential carcinogens.The study of chemical mutagenesis began in the early 1940s when Charlotte Auerbach and colleagues discovered that mustard gas, a chemical warfare agent used against soldiers in trenches during the First World War was capable of causing genetic mutation in fruit fly, Drosophila (reviewed by Beale, 1993). Since then and for the next three decades, most experiments were performed on mice or flies to study chemically-induced mutation. Eventually, better test systems based on yeast and bacteria were developed where data can be obtained cheaper and quicker than using flies or mice. Furthermore, the inclusion of liver extracts and cofactors allowed the detection of more mutagenic agents and highlight the importance of biotransformation in mutagenesis studies. Then, in 1973 Bruce Ames successfully showed that various chemical carcinogens induced mutation in the genetically- engineered Salmonella typhimurium bacteria (Ames et al., 1973), known today as the Ames test which has been widely used to screen potential cancer-causing agents.Genotoxic agents are rather ubiquitous in the environment whether they are man-made products or found naturally. Many synthetic chemicals employed in manufacturing industry,X-rays developed for medical diagnosis and carcinogenic hydrocarbons in coal tar or smelters are examples of genotoxic compounds of man-made in origin. Even the way of howCopy 1 32Y. SharifuddinChapter 1food is being prepared such as grilling red meat at high temperatures are known to yield potent mutagens. Naturally occurring agents include aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus | that grows on nuts and isothiocyanates, the mutagenic phytochemicals found in cruciferousivegetables. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals that are endogenously produced as a result of cellular metabolism are also known to be genotoxic. Figure 1.12 shows the mechanisms of actions of DNA and non-DNA reactive genotoxicants.Genetic toxicology is a broader term than chemical mutagenesis, dedicated to the study of genetic damage, the physical and chemical agents that are responsible, the mechanism involved for it as well as the cellular and organisms' responses to this injury. Since the potential consequences of genetic damage include birth defects and cancer, the elucidation of novel substances' potential to elicit DNA damage and genome instability is an important step in the development of new medicines and other products intended for human use. Various endpoints can be employed in assessing genotoxic damage and they are shown in Figure 1.13.1.12 Biotransformation of XenobioticsAll organisms are constantly exposed to foreign chemicals and these can be man-made (drugs, industrial chemicals) or naturally occurring compounds from the environment.Uptake is usually via ingestion, however inhalation and transdermal routes are also possible.Due to the lipophilicity of many chemicals that facilitate their uptake via these routes, organisms have evolved mechanisms to increase their hydrophilicity for rapid excretion via bile and urine. Otherwise, the accumulation of these xenobiotics will overwhelm defense mechanisms and disrupt systemic homeostasis. This process is known as biotransformation and is catalysed by various enzymes primarily in the liver of higher organisms but are also present in other organs such as the gut, kidneys and lungs.Plants have been known to be one of the reasons for the evolution of biotransformation in animals. Most animals are plant-eaters and customarily being bombarded by various secondary metabolites which play a role in plants' defence mechanisms. However, many chemicals can also be transformed into more reactive metabolites. In pharmacology for example, the metabolites of some parent drugs impose the desired therapeutic effect but inCopy 1 33(r)c<N.5&V. ?s>3d) DOJ) F*Irt al Mo *-- eofi ww) PS~o Of)5b \"35 <u<--* O e i^3 OJ0> csM'7*>>l r. jClJ ^ c<3Z EO C3 w -Os <&*Z << Qr 00<< .S PS 2 * 3<teftsflBIn esVfi.O#*-<w,15 r- ^*\" O *-# ~ CJ-C -- '*#5 >, oO #PS o<L>Y.

Different compounds will possess varying effects due to the length of time they remain in the organism. A compound that is toxicologically very active but is extremely hydrophilic will be easily excreted from the body without the possibility of inducing severe damage in contrast to relatively low activity compound that is hydrophobic but lingers longer in the body and could potentially be more harmful. Biotransformation will be discussed in greater length in Part 2 of the second Chapter in this thesis.I| Various pro-mutagenic and pro-carcinogenic compounds require metabolic activation before| they can exert their effect and typical cell culture techniques do not often maintain the[ metabolic capacity of the liver. Accordingly, the addition of S9-fraction of liver homogenateinto cell cultures in vitro was intended to provide an external metabolic capability. The creation of cell lines for genotoxicology applications, which have been genetically engineered to be metabolically competent such as AHH-1 and MCL-5 serve as an alternative ! to the addition of S9-fraction, thus permitting the assessment of xenobiotics that needjbioactivation.1.13 The Cycle of Cell DivisionCells proliferate in response to extracellular growth factors, passing through a repeated sequence of events known as the cell cycle. This has four major phases: Gi, then S, G2 and lastly the mitotic or M-phase. This is followed by division of the cytoplasm and plasma membrane to produce two daughter cells. Gi, S and G2 together constitute interphase, which is the majority of the cell cycle. During interphase, the cytoplasm increase in volume, the DNA is uncoiled then diffuse within the nucleus and is a stage of general growth where ribosomes, mitochondria and other cellular proteins are synthesise. The chromosomes are replicated during the DNA synthetic or S-phase. Most somatic cells in the body are not actively dividing and are arrested at Go within Gi.

The program contains a knowledge base of structure-metabolism relationships and each describes a metabolic reaction, characteristic of xenobiotics with a common structural feature. METEOR reasoning rule-base contains 841 rules, 217 mammalian Phase I and II biotranformations allowing the program to evaluate the relative probabilities of various metabolic pathways (Langowski & Long, 2002). Results are accompanied by comments and literature citations as evidence that is specific, making evaluations easier. The strength of METEOR lies in its ability to predict the metabolites that are likely to be generated rather than all possible candidates (Greene et al., 1999).In certain circumstances, experimental data from metabolism studies discloses empirical formula of metabolites and not their molecular structure, which effectively impair a thorough assessment of the possible chemical properties such as toxicity possess by the metabolites since different molecular structure denotes different activities. The program is capable of recommending the most likely molecular structure and even anticipates different promising structures from the same empirical formula.

Hydrogen options: perceive implicit and explicit hydrogens.2.11 RESULTS| The METEOR programme predicted plausible andrographolide metabolites in Phase I and| II biotransformation and the possible routes are summarised as a metabolic tree in Figurej 2.15. The data used for the tree construction were generated by METEOR and variousreactions that contributed to this process are also stated. Figure 2.17 is the same metabolicij tree but instead of empirical formula, the tree shows molecular weight. As thei| biotransformation pathway progresses, the molecular weight of the metabolites predicted| increased. Another metabolite tree shown as Figure 2.18 is essentially the same as the onei| depicted in Figure 2.15 but highlighted the Phase II reactions in blue while those that cani| be achieved by cytochrome P450 are shown in other lighter colours.Although the empirical formulae of all possible metabolites were shown in Figure 2.15, various different chemical structures can be derived from the same chemical formula, a task METEOR was equipped to handle. Due to the large size of information generated, examples of selected reactions involving the metabolism of andrographolide are shown in Figures 2.16a to 2.16f.Copy I 87Y.

SharifuddinChapter 22.12 DISCUSSIONThe metabolic tree suggested by METEOR is useful in the initial prediction of possible metabolites of andrographolide especially when there is currently a paucity of sufficient data. Figure 2.15 shows all possible metabolites derived from andrographolide, the parent compound. Various functional groups attached to the aglycone provide many possible substrates for Phase I and Phase II enzymes. The progression of the metabolic tree also showed steady increment in molecular weight and polarity of the metabolites by the addition of other groups such as glutathione and glucuronide as shown in Figure 2.17. The resultant metabolites possess higher polarity and hydrophilicity mainly attributed to the high molecular weight of the conjugates, hence facilitates their excretion from the body. As depicted both in Figures 2.17 and 2.18, the molecular size of the metabolites produced by Phase II reactions were higher that those subjected to Phase I metabolism. Indeed, the Phase II biotransformation reactions with the exception of acetylation and methylation, result in a large increase of xenobiotic hydrophilicity (Gibson & Skett, 2001). The extract of Andrographis paniculata including andrographolide and its analogues have been shown to affect hepatic biotransformation enzymes such as anilinehydroxylase, N- and O- demethylase (Choudhary & Poddar, 1984), alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (Trivedi & Rawal, 2000) as well as glutathione S-transferase and DT- diaphorase (Phase II biotransformation enzymes) (Singh et al., 2001).Several metabolites of andrographolide have also been identified in rats and humans. Ten metabolites of andrographolide mainly in the form of sulfonic acid conjugates and sulfate compounds were isolated and identified in urine, feces as well as contents of small intestine after the compound was orally administered to rats (He et al., 2003a, b, c). Cui et al. (2004) also reported structural identification of four urinary metabolites of andrographolide from human volunteers, of which three of the metabolites were categorised as 3-O-sulfate conjugates and the remaining one as 3-O-sulfate-12-S-cysteine conjugate. An additional seven Phase II metabolites were isolated from human urine and all were characterised as glucuronide conjugates, where four were found to be two pairs of geometric isomers (Cui et al., 2005). All these findings are in line with the predictions made by METEOR in terms of plausible reactions that might be involved in andrographolide metabolism where different functional groups such as primary aliphatic alcohols and epoxides are being targeted by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and glutathione S-transferases respectively.Copy 1 94Y. SharifuddinChapter 2Indeed, assessment of andrographolide structure by DEREK identified the a, p-unsaturated ester position as capable of educing chromosome damage and METEOR also suggested that this position is susceptible to conjugation with glutathione as illustrated in Figure 2.16c. Furthermore, compounds containing the a, p-unsaturated ester has been known to be metabolised via conjugation with glutathione and hydrolysis (Frederick et al., 1992; Greim et al., 1995; McCarthy & Witz, 1997)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:11:47.561499Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T13:20:11.224650Z","inner_id":6,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":7,"annotations":[{"id":7,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3805,"end":3825,"text":"Teuchrium

conjugates formed in the liver can be excreted intact in bile or they can be transformed to mercapturic acids in the kidney and excreted in urine. The conversion of glutathione conjugates to mercapturic acids requires sequential cleavage of glycine and glutamic acid from glutathione moiety subsequently followed by N-acetylation of the resulting cysteine conjugate (Gibson & Skett, 2001). Glutathione conjugation of metabolites is an important detoxification step because electrophiles for example, are known to be potentially genotoxic species and can bind to critical nucleophiles such as DNA and proteins leading to genetic mutations and cellular damage. However, in some cases, conjugation with glutathione amplifies the toxicity of a xenobiotic by being inherently toxic or being degraded into a toxic metabolite (Williams & Aruoma. 2000).As shown in Figure 2.18, andrographolide can be converted into four possible metabolites via 7 different reactions and these metabolites in turn can also be further transformed into various different metabolites. However, cellular conditions and the amounts of cofactors present for Phase II metabolism dictate the direction of biotransformation pathway. Thus, there will be major and minor andrographolide metabolites being produced depending on the circumstances. The cellular concentrations of PAPS for example (approximately 75pM), are significantly lower than those of glutathione (~10mM) and UDP-glucuronic acid (~350pM) and the relatively low concentration of PAPS limits the capacity for xenobiotic sulfonation (Gibson & Skett, 2001). The availability of UDP-glucuronic acid can also limit the rate of glucuronidation of endogenous as well as exogenous compounds especially if they are in high doses and being extensively conjugated such as acetaminophen. Figure 2.19 shows one example of possible routes for andrographolide biotransformation yielding a glutathione-conjugate.Before the Phase II biotransformation, andrographolide is susceptible to Phase I enzymes as suggested by the metabolic tree (Figure 2.18). Hydroxylation and epoxidation of doubleCopy 1 95Y. SharifuddinChapter 2bonds are two main reactions of andrographolide metabolism attributed to cytochrome P450. Even though the aglycone was predicted to be metabolised by these reactions, one cannot really ascertain whether the metabolites are more or less reactive by referring to the metabolic tree. Andrographolide is shown to be susceptible to epoxidation of the double bonds and as shown in Figure 2.16f, this epoxide group resides close to the butyrolactone moiety of the phytochemical. Although, epoxides have been known to be potentially mutagenic (Guengerich, 2003; Benigni, 2005) per se, the reactivity of epoxy- andrographolide can only be determined experimentally. Alternatively, another double bond exists within the structure at the A8(17^ position as highlighted in Figure 2.8 and is also susceptible to epoxidation according to METEOR assessment. However, the half-lives of relatively simple epoxides are known to be usually on the order of hours in the absence of added nucleophiles. Many of these simple epoxides are carcinogens when administered to rodents at high doses (Dunkelberg, 1979) whereas the evidence for human carcinogenicity such as styrene is probably equivocal at best (Yeowell-O'Connell et al, 1998). Functionalisation of epoxides with the addition of certain groups lead to enhanced reactivity such as 2 -cyanoethylene oxide that is more reactive than propylene oxide and is mutagenic (Recio et al., 1988; 2001). Butadiene diepoxide is much more reactive and genotoxic than would be expected on the statistical basis of having two epoxides (Cochrane & Skopek, 1994). A comparable example on epoxide generation in herbs is that observed in Teuchrium chamaedrys (Germander), which was once promoted as slimming products in the 1990s until hepatotoxicity cases were reported in France. The hepatotoxicity has been attributed to the diterpenoids in T. chamaedrys namely teucrin A and teuchamaedryn A.The furan ring of these diterpenoids is susceptible to oxidation by CYP3A4, which has a wide substrate spectrum, to reactive epoxides that react with proteins such epoxide hydrolase and CYP3A (Loeper et al., 1994; Lekehal et al., 1996; Fau et al., 1997; Loeper et al., 2001). The presence of these reactive epoxides led to mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and apoptosis in rat and mouse hepatocytes (Loeper et al., 1994;Lekehal et al., 1996; Fau et al 1997). It was revealed that teucrin A binds covalently to hepatocyte proteins and the furano diterpenoid part of the compound increased cytosolic^ Ilevels of Ca but decreased cellular glutathione (GSH) and cytoskeleton-associated protein thiols resulting in the formation of plasma membrane blebs and apoptosis (Lekehal et al.,1996; Fau et al 1997).Copy 1 96Y. SharifuddinChapter 2Futhermore, the epoxide functional group in andrographolide can be further converted into vicinal diols, another functional group that can be mutagenic, which may or may not increase the reactivity of andrographolide and can only be assess in laboratory studies. However, this prediction is made on the probability that these metabolic routes are the one favoured by the cellular or systemic conditions since there were other relatively safer pathways such as glucuronidation. The possibility that these metabolites are produced as minority products cannot be ruled out too. It is also important to note that the unsaturated butyrolactone site of andrographolide was predicted by DEREK as able to cause chromosome damage in mammals and whether structural transformation to this moiety will enhance or reduce the potency of such effect is not deducible without experimental data, which currently is inadequate.Recently, Jarukamjom et al. (2006) studied the impact of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of A. paniculata on mouse hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and found the extracts to significantly elevate the activities of ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) but not methoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (MROD).It was also suggested that CYP1A1 and CYP2B10 were the P450 isoforms responsive to A. paniculata extracts (Jarukamjom et al., 2006). However, the utilisation of crude extracts in the study cannot provide valuable qualitative data on the effects of individual components in the extracts on specific P450 isoforms, especially andrographolide which is a major diterpenoid present (Kleipool, 1952; Siripong et al., 1992). Furthermore, one must take into account that individual substances in the extract, as it is the case with many plant extracts, may act in an antagonistic or synergistic manner in the expression of bioactivation and detoxification pathways. Thus, another study into the effects of andrographolide on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes activities showed that the phytochemical significantly evoked the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 but not that of CYP1B1 in mouse hepatocytes in a concentration-dependent manner (Jaruchotikamol et al., 2007). The mRNA expression of CYP1A1 induced by andrographolide is higher compared to CYP1A2 but lower than that stimulated with typical CYP1A agonists such as benz(a)anthracene and p-naphthoflavone (Jaruchotikamol et al., 2007). It is known that the mechanisms of transcription regulation differ between CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 (Guengerich & Shimada, 1998) hence the dissimilarity in the expression levels observed (Jaruchotikamol et al., 2007). However, further studies involving major cytochromes such as CYP3A4 isCopy 1 97Y. SharifuddinChapter 2needed. This recent study could possibly shed more light into the reported hepatoprotective effect modulated by andrographolide.Andrographolide has been reported to be the major anti-hepatotoxic compound present in A. paniculata extract conferring protection to liver cells against toxicity induced by carbon- tetrachloride, galactosamine and acetaminophen (Handa & Sharma, 1990a; Handa &Sharma, 1990b). Since the mode of action and hence toxicity induced by galactosamine and acetaminophen are different, it was suggested that a non-specific hepatoprotective activity may be attributed to this phytochemical (Handa & Sharma, 1990b). It may be possible that andrographolide is involved in cytochrome P450 activity manipulation, effectively shielding the liver cells from cytotoxicity. After all, cytochromes 1A2, 2E1,2A6 and 3A4 have been shown to oxidise acetaminophen (paracetamol) into A-acetyl-\/?- benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) that in turn is detoxified by glutathione (GSH) resulting in the formation of acetaminophen-GSH conjugate (Patten et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1998)Although metabolic predictions made by CSAR programme such as METEOR is useful, there are several caveats to this finding. Any predictions made cannot overrule experimental data. Mammals was the chosen parameter for METEOR where no distinction was made between human and animals, thus the metabolic tree generated was not representative of any particular species but mammals in general plus there are inter- and intra-species variability in metabolic capacity. This might explain the absence of sulfonation process from the metabolic tree generated in contrary to experimental findings where sulfate conjugates were isolated (He et al., 2003a, b, c; Cui et al. 2004). Secondly, METEOR is able to suggest the most plausible molecular structure of possible metabolites but it cannot exactly determine their reactivity and toxicity, which can only be proven experimentally. This involves extraction and identification of the metabolites using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\/MS) to name a few. Subsequently, various genotoxicity studies whether in vitro and subsequently followed by in vivo if necessary, can be performed on the isolated metabolites to assess its genotoxic potential. For example, butyrylactone moiety of andrographolide was suggested to contribute to its activity but this functional group is susceptible to conjugation with glutathione and one can never be certain whether andrographolide will be more or less reactive. Finally, all of the metabolism studies cited previously merely elucidate the type of metabolites being produced by a rather small sample of healthy maleCopy 1 98Y. SharifuddinChapter 2human volunteers and rats. Although the studies did not report any adverse effects experienced by the human volunteers during the study period, this does not necessarily means that more subtle form of injury such as mutagenesis and cellular damage can be mled out despite successful extraction of more hydrophilic metabolites. Furthermore, human metabolism studies may produce metabolites from the compound of interest, which may not be observed in in vitro or animal studies and therefore may not have been thoroughly assessed for possible risk to humans. In a case where the metabolites wereconsiderably high in humans, additional testing with the metabolites or the pathwaysinvolved would be essential to properly evaluate the potential of the compound to cause genotoxicity in humans (US FDA, 2005).Therefore, METEOR was useful in determining the most plausible routes ofbiotransformation for a compound based on the application of structure-activityrelationships and meant to complement experimental data or assisting in better experimental designs. In this study, many similarities were observed between the results generated via in silico assessment of possible andrographolide metabolism pattern using METEOR and in vitro\/in vivo experiments conducted previously, thereby granting the opportunity to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of such approach. Furthermore, semi-quantitative information on metabolic fate of this phytochemical along with SAR study conducted using DEREK gave a better picture.Copy I 993CHAPTER 3ASSESSMENT OF ANDROGRAPHOLIDE GENOTOXICITY POTENTIAL USING THE IN VITRO CYTOKINESIS BLOCK MICRONUCLEUS ASSAYY. SharifuddinChapter 3CHAPTER 3ASSESSMENT OF ANDROGRAPHOLIDE GENOTOXICITY POTENTIAL USING THE IN VITRO CYTOKINESIS BLOCK MICRONUCLEUS ASSAY3.1 Micronuclei as Genotoxicity Biomarker: A Historical PerspectiveThe most often used assay in routine genotoxicity testing of xenobiotics in vitro is bacterial mutation (Ames test). However, the detection of natural and synthetic carcinogenic substances that act through a non-direct mode of DNA alteration and are negative in bacterial mutation assays requires additional test systems. Another often-used endpoint in routine testing is the induction of chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells. Alternatively, the in vitro micronucleus assay is easier to perform and is suitable to monitor genotoxicity of such compounds in mammalian cells.Micronuclei were described as \"corpuscules intraglobulaires\" by Jolly in the late 1800s and early 1900s or known as \"fragment of nuclear material\" in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes by Howell about a century ago hence these structures are known to hematologists as \"Howell- Jolly bodies\". Similar intracellular structures were described in other cell types, for example in rat and mouse embryos by Brenneke in 1937 or in Vicia faba by Thoday in 1951, and are known as \"fragment nuclei\" or \"micronuclei\". These micronuclei were consistently found after radiation exposure of cells and it was assumed that they originated from acentric fragments that were excluded from the two daughter nuclei at the late stages of mitosis. The instrumental application of micronucleus as biomarkers for cytogenetic damage was discovered by Evans et al. in 1959, while comparing the efficiency of neutrons to y-rays in Vicia faba roots.Boiler and Schmid's work paved the way for the utilisation of micronuclei as an assay system for elucidating genotoxicity potential and were first to suggest the term \"micronucleus\". Studies on bone marrow erythrocytes by Heddle also contributed to theCopy 1 100Y. SharifuddinChapter 3decisive development. Subsequently, Countryman and Heddle introduced lymphocytes as another useful cellular system for detection of chromosomal damage by the determination of micronucleus induction. They also recommended the utilisation of micronuclei as a biomarker in testing schemes.3.2 The In Vitro Cytokinesis Block Micronucleus Assay and Its ApplicationThe simplicity of scoring and wide applicability of the in vitro micronucleus test in various cell types makes it an appealing method in cytogenetic abnormality assessment. However, incomplete comprehension of micronuclei induction mechanisms and the absence of sufficient methods to concurrently assess cell proliferation and micronucleus formation, inevitably delayed the validation of the in vitro micronucleus test for genotoxicity testing.Micronuclei are small, membrane bound extranuclear bodies that arise in dividing cells from whole chromosome\/chromatids or acentric chromosome\/chromatid fragments that lag behind in anaphase and remained outside of the daughter cells' nuclei in telophase. Micronuclei are only formed during cell division regardless of the location of the actual damage that occurred during the cell cycle, either by damage to the DNA or damage to the mitotic apparatus.In the in vitro cytokinesis block micronucleus assay (CBMA) developed by Fenech and Morley (1985), cytochalasin-B is added to the cells in culture. Cytochalasin-B is a metabolite of the fungus Helminthosporium dematioideum that blocks cytokinesis but not karyokinesis and results in the formation of binucleated cells from cells that have undergone one nuclear division (Carter, 1967; Ridler & Smith, 1968). Cytochalasin-B prevents cytokinesis by binding to high-molecular-weight complexes in the plasma membrane, which is responsible in inducing actin polymerisation to form microfilaments that governs the cleavage of the dividing cell into two daughter cells. This allowed the identification of once-divided nuclei in binucleated cells and granted an efficient approach to study the mechanism leading to micronuclei formation as illustrated in Figure 3.1. With restriction on micronuclei scoring only in cells that had undergone one cell cycle, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assayCopy 1libraryY. SharifuddinChapter 3(CBMA) solved the technical predicament of possible variation in micronucleus frequency caused by modifications in the proportion of dividing cells that may occur either due to sub- optimal culture conditions or exposure to genotoxic agents (Fenech, 2000). Table 3.1 compares the in vitro CBMA and chromosomal aberration assay, which is widely used previously to assess genotoxicity.A micronucleus that contains a whole chromosome mainly results from defects in the chromosome segregation machinery such as failure of the mitotic spindle, kinetochore, or other parts of the mitotic apparatus, deficiencies in the cell cycle governing genes or by damage to chromosomal substructures, mechanical disruption (Albertini et al., 2000) as well as centromeric DNA hypomethylation (Fenech et al., 2005)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:11:47.561996Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T13:30:51.855238Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":8,"annotations":[{"id":8,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":13098,"end":13112,"text":"anti-apoptotic","labels":["Medicinal

14- days incubation period was adopted because it was the routine procedure performed previously in the laboratory (Barber et al. 2006, Doak et al., 2007).Even though the cell viability in this study was performed using equation (2), where viability was measured as part of the plating efficiency after 14-days, other methods can also be employed and the Relative Total Growth (RTG) calculation is one example. The RTG calculation depends on cell number. As stated previously, during the 14-day phenotypic expression period the cells were sub-cultured routinely on alternate days but the author inadvertently did not record the figures, since sub-culturing was performed primarily to maintain a low cell number and cell viability will be determined after another 14-days (equation 2). However, based on visual observation made by the author, the cell number showed a dose-response relationship between sub-culturing procedures and the author believes that should the Relative Total Growth were calculated for cytotoxicity, the outcome would have be the same as that observed in Figure 5.6, where the phytochemical exerted a increasing cytotoxicity with increasing concentrations. Thus, the author recommends the inclusion of Relative Total Growth (RTG) calculation as part of | cytotoxicity assessment in this assay for a more accurate measurement since cell death during the long expression period was excluded in the cell viability calculation. This may lead to underestimation of cytotoxicity.This study showed that andrographolide is able to elicit point mutations in mammalian AHH-1 cells in vitro at a concentration as low as 5pM with the highest frequency of mutants recorded at 30pM. The biological significance of this finding remains to be seen.Copy1 2126CHAPTER 6GENERAL DISCUSSIONY. SharifuddinChapter 6CHAPTER 6 GENERAL DISCUSSIONi6.1. The Objectives of the StudiesThe studies discussed in this thesis were performed to investigate the potential genotoxicity and toxicity of andrographolide, an active phytochemical found in various parts of the annual herb Andrographis paniculata.Herbal products containing phytochemicals have long been an important part and parcel of traditional medicines, that were handed down from one generation of practitioners to another over hundreds of years. The plants to be used and its applications were carefully described in various older traditional healthcare systems such in China and Ayurveda in India, which are philosophically-based and regarded to be holistic in principle, which aim to treat the patient as a whole rather than singling the disease suffered by the patient. They have much in common with traditional medical herbalism as it was and still is practised in Europe and North America.In Part 1, Chapter 1 of this thesis, various factors involved in the revival of interest in phytomedicines, current UK and EU regulations in place regarding phytomedicines, the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines were discussed in length. Furthermore, the importance of phytochemicals in drug discovery and renewed interests exhibited by the | pharmaceutical industry in concordant with the emergence of new technologies, allowing new approaches in research and development of new chemical entities isolated from plants. However, this increased interests in harnessing the hidden knowledge described in ancient medical manuscripts or those trapped within the memory of its practitioners, are not always welcome by the developing countries who claimed that they are being subjected to biopiracy. These countries have various reasons to believe so due to their rich biodiversity, local socio-economic status and the high percentage of the local population that still trust and rely on traditional herbal medications. Brazil and Malaysia for example, armed themselves with strict legislation regarding the sample collection and exports of flora fromCopy 1 213Y. SharifuddinChapter 6the rainforests. India on the other hand had embarked on an expensively ambitious project,jchristened the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library with the objective of compiling a 30- million-page electronic encyclopaedia of ancient Indian medical systems of ayurveda, unani and siddha which date back thousands of years. This initiative is perfectly understandable in ensuring such knowledge remained in public hands rather than corporate patents, as the Indian government has been embroiled in many high-profile patent litigation cases challenging individuals and companies alike in the US and European Patent Offices.\\\\\\| Part 1 of the first chapter also detailing the importance of safety assessment of phytomedicines and phytochemicals for the benefit of both the general public and the industry. Introduction to the compound of interest, andrographolide and previous studies on the potential toxicity and genotoxicity of this phytochemical was also discussed.As elaborated previously, the increased consumption of traditional herbal products by the general public in conjunction with the perception that such products are entirely safe due to its 'natural' status and the paucity of reliable scientific data on their safety as well as their efficacy, should be immediately addressed. The author also believes that such opinions and attitudes by the public towards herbal products consumption would continue as the trend of leading a natural and 'green' lifestyle is currently in vogue. Data are lacking on various aspects of herbal medicines including subtle detrimental effects such as mutations, their impact on biotransformation as well as possible drug-herb interactions.Computer-assisted structure activity relationship programmes based on expert knowledge, namely DEREK and METEOR were employed to provide semi-qualitative predictions on the toxicity and possible metabolites of andrographolide. The in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMA) was used to investigate the potential of andrographolide to induce micronuclei, a reliable genotoxic biomarker in metabolically competent cell lines, i The assay was also combined with kinetochore labelling using CREST antibodies toI elucidate the mechanisms responsible in micronuclei induction (see Chapter 3).Cytotoxicity of andrographolide was also examined using microscopical identification of necrotic and apoptotic cells as well as trypan-blue exclusion assay. After andrographolide was found to act primarily in an aneugenic manner as opposed to being a clastogen, assessment of the compound's capacity to disrupt mitotic machinery and causing chromosome aberrations were assessed (see Chapter 4). In relation to disruption to mitoticCopy 1 214Y. SharifuddinChapter 6apparatus, mitotic outcome and cellular recovery after andrographolide exposure were also looked into. The data obtained on these studies assisted in providing better comprehension | of andrographolide's possible mode of action. It is generally accepted that aneugenic compounds possess a threshold of genotoxicity (COM, 2002), thus the underlying mode of action would also show a threshold of activity. HPRT forward mutation assay was chosen because it was suitably robust for qualitative and quantitative determination of genotoxic potential (see Chapter 5).|[i| In Silico Screening of Toxicity and Prediction of Andrographolide BiotransformationThe existence of high number of phytochemicals with wide structural diversity and the paucity of data on their various properties are some of the factors that is slowing down the research & development including safety assessment procedures. Computer-assisted structure activity relationship (CSAR) assessment allows semi-qualitative assessment and priority setting for testing strategies on high number of compounds before embarking on laboratory-based experiments. Two expert-knowledge-based programmes namely DEREK and METEOR were used to predict in silico the toxicity and biotransformation of andrographolide respectively. The results obtained using DEREK showed that andrographolide is capable of causing nephropathy in rodents as well as skin sensitisation and chromosome damage in mammals in vitro, where the latter is attributed to the presence a-alkylidene y-butyrolactone moiety detected as a, p-unsaturated ester or thioester by DEREK. Indeed, this particular part of the chemical structure among others was supported by experimental data to be responsible for the phytochemical's cytotoxic activity in vitro (Nanduri et al, 2004). It is worth pointing out that DEREK regarded the cytotoxic and | genotoxic potential of andrographolide to be plausible in vitro because the programme is examining the chemical structure of andrographolide whereas in vivo, the compound would | be subjected to biotransformation where the metabolites can either be more reactive or vice-versa. Thus METEOR was utilised to providing possible Phase I and II biotransformation routes of andrographolide. The various possible metabolites anticipated by METEOR exhibited similar outcome compared to those obtained experimentally. Previous studies involving rodents and small sample of human volunteers showed a variety of metabolites and all of these were anticipated by METEOR. However, the programme was not capable of determining whether these possible metabolites are more or less reactiveCopy 1 215Y. SharifuddinChapter 6than the parent compound. As discussed previously, CSAR programmes are useful in certain aspects but they can only complement but not overrule experimental findings.DEREK, METEOR or any other expert-knowledge-based programme can also be useful in priority setting for testing strategies, for example the European Union adopted a legislative|| proposal for a new chemical management system known as REACH that for one aspect, requires thousands of chemicals in cosmetics to be tested against skin irritation and yet the EU also warrants that testing of chemicals for cosmetic products in animals to end by 2009.6.2 Elucidating the Genotoxic Potential of Andrographolide In VitroThe results obtained using the CSAR programmes provided a sketch on andrographolide's toxicity portrait. The in vitro cytokinesis-block mironucleus assay (CBMA) in combination with anti-kinetochore labelling using CREST antibodies was used to paint a better picture of the portrait and it was revealed that andrographolide induced statistically significant micronuclei frequency at the lower concentrations tested, primarily in an aneugenic manner in V-79, AHH-1 and MCL-5 cell lines. There was significant difference in the frequency of micronuclei induction between the three cell lines tested and this may be attributed to the difference in metabolic capacity. Although V-79 cells are not metabolically competent, attributing the higher micronuclei frequency observed mainly due to biotransformation deficit might not be flawless. Ideally, data comparison between andrographolide-treated V- 79 cells supplemented with S9-liver extract and those that are not might provide a better picture on the effect metabolic enzymes upon andrographolide genotoxicity potential.1| However, the presence of external metabolic capacity such as S9 poses disadvantages of its own since the low levels of certain P450 cytochromes and high levels of others, does not j necessarily represent normal animal or human biotransformation process (Tweats et al 2007). Nonetheless, these data provided valuable insights into andrographolide biotransformation in human cell lines that also augment the in silico predictions derived from DEREK and METEOR. The V-79 cell line is deficient in p53 activity whereas AHH- 1 and MCL-5 cells are capable of undergoing normal DNA repair process and judging by available data on the frequency of micronuclei induction, the cells' p53 status were considered to be not of significant influence in cellular response towards andrographolide. Rajagopal et al. (2003) reported that the p53 status of cancer cells exposed toY. SharifuddinChapter 6andrographolide did not account for the anti-proliferative properties exerted by the compound.Andrographolide was also found to cause cell death in a dose-dependent fashion mainly via | necrosis rather than apoptosis. Different methods were employed to assess the cytotoxicityof the phytochemical of interest and the trend observed was similar. Cellular toxicity exerted by andrographolide was demonstrated to be dependent on dose and incubation time. When MCL-5 cells were treated with andrographolide for 8 hours, the frequency of apoptotic cells was most prominent at 30 and 50pM but was still not as high as cells that suffered necrosis. Prolonging the treatment period from 8 to 24 hours caused even more cells to undergo necrotic cell death whereas neither increment nor reduction was recorded for apoptotic cells and the value still lingered less than 2% of the cell population scored.Cell death induced by andrographolide was recently suggested to be independent of cellular caspase activities (Li et al., 2007). As discussed previously, andrographolide's influence on apoptosis is still not clear. There were reports of anti-apoptotic properties (Burgos et al.,2004; Chen et al., 2004) as well as pro-apoptotic effects in cells (Cheung et al., 2005; Kim & Milner, 2005) treated with andrographolide. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of these effects remained largely unexplored and it is still to be determined whether andrographolide impose its anti\/pro-apoptotic effects via direct or indirect action on cellular target(s).The concentrations of andrographolide at 30 and 50pM administered to cells that elicited relatively high apoptotic response also educed comparatively high micronuclei incidence, suggesting a possible link between these doses, micronucleation and apoptotic responses. Decordier et al., (2005) proposed that increased caspase-3 activity has a direct role in | micronuclei formation. Indeed, caspase-3 activity, which is a distinguishing factor in| apoptosis execution, was observed to be up-regulated in the presence of andrographolidei(Li et al., 2007). It may be possible that this phytochemical only exert micronucleation at these concentrations after the cellular defense mechanisms has been overwhelmed or sufficient cellular target(s) has been damaged leading limited apoptotic reaction since cells die mainly via necrosis. Damage to cytoskeleton and other mitotic machinery may also initiate apoptosis (Decordier et al., 2002).Copy 1 217Y. SharifuddinChapter 6The phytochemical was demonstrated to inhibit cell growth and elicit cell death primarily via necrosis as the dose increased. Apoptosis was found to be a minor form of cell demise. Andrographolide exerts it cellular toxicity in time- and dose-dependent manner, where necrotic response was witnessed to be increased between 8 and 24 hours, in contrast to apoptosis which remained fairly stagnant during the same period. It seemed andrographolide has higher propensity to incite necrosis than the programmed cell death. Necrosis results from damage to a number of cellular constituents, including the plasma membrane. Several mechanisms alone or in combination can trigger and promote necrosis.These include plasma membrane permeability changes, which lead to a collapse of ion homeostasis, followed by cell and organelle swelling, and culminating in rupture of the cell membrane. For a given xenobiotic, the exact mechanisms leading to necrosis are not always known because the sequence of events is complex and many of these molecular events are causally interrelated with other mechanisms. Cause and effect cannot always be dissected from each other. Whether andrographolide inhibit apoptosis thus forcing damaged cells to die via necrosis, or various cellular targets were damaged by the compound and lead to necrosis, or a combination of both, is still not entirely clear.Although the genotoxicity portrait of this main phytochemical from Andrographis paniculata is clearer than before, it is still lacking refined colours. Since andrographolide act primarily in an aneugenic manner when inducing micronuclei, it may not directly acting on the DNA itself but exert its genotoxic influence indirectly by targeting various other cellular targets including but not limited to the mitotic machinery. The study on Chinese hamster lung fibroblast V-79 cells showed that andrographolide caused the numerical amplification of the microtubule organising centres (MTOCs) with corresponding aberration in chromosome segregation, which supported the data on micronuclei induction observed in V-79 cells as well as those in AHH-1 and MCL-5. This concentration- dependent effect also caused accruement of cells experiencing mitotic arrest. As the cells challenged with andrographolide harbours abnormal polarity during mitosis, it was deemed an interesting venture to see if such anomaly would give rise to cells with more than one nuclei. MCL-5 and V-79 cells were exposed to andrographolide for one and two cell cycles, subsequently cell fate and cell death frequency were determined microscopically.The presence of multiple MTOCs promoted aberrant mitoses. MCL-5 cells were also exposed to andrographolide for a longer period of 5 cell cycles in order to compare the mitotic outcome and cytotoxicity levels with cells challenged with the phytochemical in aCopy 1 218Y. SharifuddinChapter 6shorter treatment period. The data showed that longer treatment period elicit mitotic aberration, cell death and reduction in cell number. As andrographolide was shown to induce damage in aneugenic manner and aneugens are known to involve threshold of damage, the possibility of cells to recover after andrographolide exposure was also examined and the data revealed that the effect generally persisted.IiThe visual determination of MTOCs number is not hard and most studies rely on antibody- labelling followed by fluorescent microscopy. Although currently this is the preferred method, data has to be interpreted cautiously. Factors to be taken into account include antibody quality, the orientation of the centrosome relative to viewing and the fact that not every particle staining with anti-PCM antibodies necessarily represents a complete centrosome.The author believes that andrographolide may exerts it influence on mammalian cells as a parent compound and metabolism of the aglycone may reduced its genotoxicity, as shown by the observed differences in micronuclei induction between the cell lines adopted in these studies and various past publications cited in this thesis point to the same conclusion. However, it is inappropriate to speculate further until genotoxic experiments involving the possible metabolites of the compound can be performed and it is also remain to be seen if extensive metabolism (Phase I and II) would have an impact on the cytotoxicity of the compound without diminishing its reported medical properties.Andrographolide was shown to cause reduced sperm count, giant multinucleated cells formation and necrotic cell death in male rats (Akbarsha & Murugaian, 2000) and the author decided to elucidate the compounds possible mechanism of action(s) as part of the genotoxicity assessment. Furthermore, the phytochemical was previously demonstrated to be able to halt the growth of various cancer cells (Siripong et al., 1992; Rajagopal et al.,!"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:11:47.562496Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T09:43:04.447496Z","inner_id":8,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":9,"annotations":[{"id":13,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":15105,"end":15128,"text":"Andrographis

Kumar et al., 2004) and it was hoped that by understanding the mode of action(s)and the effect on cell division kinetics would pave the way to the discovery of a possible pharmacological lead if not a potential anti-mitotic compound on its own or in combination with existing treatment.The measurements of replication and mitotic indexes after exposure to andrographolide for one cell cycle may underestimate the compound's cytotoxicity since these endpoints onlyY. SharifuddinChapter 6take into account the percentage of cell population that proliferated and attempting to progress through mitosis. The proportion of dead and dying cells were excluded. These short-term cytotoxicity parameters and the trypan-blue exclusion assay were reported to underestimate cytotoxicity (Fellowes & Donovan, 2007). Andrographolide was demonstrated to cause necrotic cell death in a dose- and exposure time-dependent manneri| rather than a prominent apoptotic response. At the top dose, andrographolide caused more than 50% cytotoxicity in the cell lines as indicated by RI, MI and trypan-blue measurements and significant reduction in cell number. Continuous exposure of MCL-5! cells to andrographolide for five cell cycles also showed that the compound maintain itsIcytotoxicity. Even though the in vitro micronucleus assay was not exclusively design for cell death measurement, the estimation of necrotic\/apoptotic cell population after andrographolide exposure provided a valuable mechanistic information.The incidence of condensed chromatin, considered to be an indication of cell death was determined in V-79 cells exposed to andrographolide. The data revealed a dose-dependent pattern of dead cell population even after the treated cells were allowed to recover for one cell cycle in the absence of andrographolide and the percentage of dead cells was similar to those treated continuously (see Table 4.6). The incidence of aberrant centrosome number measured directly after exposure and the incremental increases in mitotic index even after the removal of andrographolide indicated that it profoundly affected the cell cycle mechanism, which in the long term may affect cell division and cell number.Furthermore, cell viability determined using the plating efficiency as discussed in Chapter 5, demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in growing AHH-1 cell colonies after 14-days of initial inoculation with the same cell concentration. Thus, based on the available data, andrographolide affected cell cycle kinetics via disruption to normal chromosome segregation and increased the mitotic index while a proportion of cell population exposed to the compound died primarily via necrosis in a dose-dependent manner. Disruption to normal cell division and chromosome damage as well as the cytotoxicity of the compound effectively reduced cell number. Furthermore, depending on the dose of exposure, the treated mammalian cells' ability to segregate normally might have been impeded evident from the persistence of cell cycle delay even in the absence of the phytochemical. The author believes that andrographolide may have a higher cytotoxicity than those measured using the previously stated parameters and even though the Relative Total GrowthCopy 1 220Y. SharifuddinChapter 6calculation was not determined, it can be proposed that based on the observation and plating efficiency figures that this phytochemical will inhibit normal cell proliferation.The results obtained would be more meaningful if the concentration of andrographolide presence in human serum is known or to what extent human exposure in vivo would be. At the moment, reliable data on this aspect is lacking. As stated earlier, many published works on this phytochemical tend to concentrate on the possible medical and therapeutic benefits of andrographolide, often overlooking the possible risks it might pose and the current lack of evidence in toxicity particularly genotoxicity may place the health of the public in jeopardy unless more information is obtained. History may not exactly repeat itself but it does tend to rhyme. Previous examples of herbal products that were not tested for its genotoxic potential such as Aristolochia fangchi, Piper methysticum and Teuchrium chamaedrys, to name a few, has been costly to public health and confidence.6.3 Further StudiesBased on the findings made in this thesis, various further studies can be carried out but not limited to those described below. * Since the methods employed to elucidate cell fate after aberrant mitosis due to centrosome amplification after andrographolide exposure is not very specific, time- lapsed video-microscopy on cell should be used to obtain a clearer picture. * Another round of in silico assessment using both DEREK and METEOR can be performed on the predicted metabolites of andrographolide, which will provide valuable additional insights. * In relation to the previous point and the results obtained, experiments to characterise the possible metabolites of andrographolide from AHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79 cell cultures can be performed for example by using mass spectrometry.Copy 1 221Y. SharifuddinChapter 6* Test the metabolites of this phytochemical to determine whether they can pose as agenotoxic threats and studies should also be performed on normal diploid humancells and cells with competent p53 activity. * Conducting microarray studies on gene expression for cells exposed toandrographolide to determine its impact on genes involved in cell death mainlyapoptosis, centrosome duplication and the mitotic checkpoint genes. Such studies would shed more lights on how andrographolide is affecting centrosome multiplication and cell death. * Experiments to further examine and quantitate the effects of andrographolide on mammalian cells using apoptosis specific assays such as the TUNEL and caspases- oriented technique can be performed. Several cell types should be employed to provide a better picture since andrographolide is known to exert cell-specific response. * Performing the in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay on larger samples with the aim of finding the threshold level of exposure since andrographolide behaves in an aneugenic manner. * Sequencing the HPRT \"mutants to obtain more information of the type of damage.6.4 ConclusionMajor conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are:* In silico assessment utilising expert knowledge-based program harnessing quantitative structure activity relationship such as DEREK and METEOR was useful in providing general initial information about andrographolide, where paucity of data exist. DEREK predicted that andrographolide is capable of causing skin sensitisation and chromosome damage in mammals in vitro. Whereas, METEOR predicted plausible Phase I and Phase II biotransformation routes of andrographolide that were in agreement with past published works.Copy 1 222Y. SharifuddinChapter 6* Andrographolide induced micronuclei formation in vitro in all three cell lines tested, primarily at the lower doses of the compound. Difference in cellular metabolic capabilities may explain the difference in the level of micronuclei incidence. * Andrographolide induced kinetochore positive micronuclei, hence may act in aneugenic manner. * The doses between 30 and 50pM induced high micronuclei frequency compared to other concentration tested and these doses also caused relatively high apoptotic response in scored cells. * Cytotoxicity measurement performed using replicative index calculation, microscopical identification and trypan-blue exclusion assay showed a similar trend in that andrographolide cytotoxicity is both time- and dose-dependent. Cell death was observed to be primarily via necrosis as opposed to programmed cell death. Micronuclei frequency was observed to generally increase in tandem with cytotoxicity, except at the top two concentrations of 70 and 90pM. This phytochemical also reduced cell growth as the concentration increased. However, the compound's cytotoxicity might have been underestimated. * Andrographolide instigated centrosome amplifications as the treatment dose increased and the presence of multiple MTOCs affected chromosomal segregation fidelity with corresponding increases in the mitotic index. * V-79 cells challenged with andrographolide for 24 hours and subsequently allowed to grow for a further 24 and 48 hours post-treatment still retained abnormal MTOCs number. * Centrosome numerical aberrations in V-79 cells challenged with andrographolide lead to anomalous mitoses where cells failed to undergo cytokinesis due to abnormal centrosome number, producing bi-, tri-, tetra- and multinucleated cells.Copy I 223Y. SharifuddinChapter 6Even in the absence of the phytochemical after the initial insult, there was still significant presence of abnormal mitoses. * Andrographolide elicited HPRT ~ mutants formation between 5 to 50pM and the induction is dose-related with 30pM induced the highest mutagenic response. Cell viability measured as plating efficiency showed that andrographolide affected cell growth and supported cytotoxicity assessment conducted earlier.All the studies completed in this thesis were conducted with the aim of adding value to the existing knowledge on andrographolide by determining its potential genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and shed more lights into its possible mode of action. There are various windows of opportunity in terms of necessary further work that can be pursued in the future, some of which have been outlined by the author earlier as there are still more questions need to be answered. Recently, self-organising map (SOM) analysis performed on andrographolide suggested that this phytochemical may possess novel mechanism(s) of action (Jada et al., 2007). Therefore the author would like to end his thesis as the novelist and lepidopterist, Vladimir Nabokov once put it, \"The greater one's science, the deeper the sense of mystery\".Copy 1 224BIBLIOGRAPHY AND APPENDIXCl Y.
