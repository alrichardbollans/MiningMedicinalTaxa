Sharifuddin 2008SUMMARYIn this thesis, the genotoxic potential of andrographolide, which is a primary phytochemical of an annual herb Andrographis paniculata, was assessed and the possible mechanisms of action were elucidated.In silico predictions showed that andrographolide may be capable of inducing skin sensitisation and chromosome damage in mammals in vitro and the identification of possible metabolites.Andrographolide was demonstrated to induce micronuclei formation in vitro in three cell lines tested namely AHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79. In AHH-1 and V-79 cell lines, the highest frequency of micronuclei was recorded at 30 pM whereas in MCL-5 cell line, 50 pM of the compound was necessary to elicit similar damage, which may be due differences in cellular metabolism capacity. The phytochemical was shown to cause dose-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in all the cell lines tested with cells dying primarily via necrosis compared to apoptosis and effectively reduced cell number.Kinetochore labelling on MCL-5 cells challenged with increasing doses of andrographolide revealed that the phytochemical acts in aneugenic manner evident from the increment in kinetochore-positive micronuclei.The compound of interest was also found to disrupt segregation fidelity via centrosome amplification resulting in chromosomal aberration. The presence of extra microtubule organising centres may play a role in the promotion of aberrant mitoses. Disruption to normal cell division was observed even after the removal of the compound in vitro.Mammalian HPRT point mutation assay using AHH-1 cell line revealed that andrographolide induced mutation evident from HPRT~ mutant colonies formation between 5pM and 30pM. The phytochemical was also found to exert cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner between 1 pM and 50pM.Thus, andrographolide is capable of disrupting normal mammalian cell division and causing dose-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro.VIY.

Traditional medicines are still widely used in developing countries and are increasingly popular in developed countries. In certain parts of the world, it is the only geographically accessible and economically feasible mode of healthcare. Globally the public, health professionals and policy-makers are wrestling with the questions about the quality, efficacy, safety, preservation and further development of this type of health care. This thesis is focusing on herbal applications in traditional medicine and highlighting the need to ensure safe application of medicines derived from plants.Modem pharmaceutical dmgs are based on chemicals with active properties and many drugs used today have been discovered through research into the physiological effects of phytochemicals, which are chemicals derived from plant sources. The primacy of plants as the source of new drug discoveries throughout human civilisation remained unrivalled until the recent competition from combinatorial chemistry (Schreiber, 2000) and computational drug design (Clark and Pickett, 2000), which effectively reduced its influence in dmgthdiscovery process. During the 20 century especially since the Industrial Revolution, efforts gradually shifted from producing medicinal plant extracts to synthetically producing these phytochemicals or their active analogues. Figure 1.1 highlights the factors that contribute to the decline of natural products in drug discovery and development. Although many can now be synthesised, such as aspirin, which is a safer analogue of salicylic acid derived from Salix alba, some of these dmgs are still derived directly from plants (e.g.Copy 1 10(c)s(U00cd0 --- 2 d>>'J j i (fi 5O 2 C3 y:n P w>-- 1 r * c \/ iC3 ^ SO c\/500 H * =# JPS^ S' i . ^o deg c.2 & y c5EQ ._ o<U>0>T3~oCCd>Oo. a'- 3ooPS PS c 2 3 .2 * - > ' PS G -5 c -- c u.^ ' o OCJ <+C'I - a s.2 * PSCQ \"5 -2> co o S~D C<U &H deg.

SharifuddinChapter 1digitalin from foxglove, Digitalis sp.). Chemicals in some plants are extracted and transformed, providing the building blocks of drugs (e.g. progesterone, synthesised from chemicals found in some species of wild yam, Dioscorea sp.). Generally, phytochemicals are referred to as new chemical entities (NCEs) especially in the industry circle and viewed as templates for structure optimisation in making perfect new drugs. Other compounds are potentially useful to humans or are of toxicological relevance.Although synthetic chemistry is currently more appealing as an approach to produce new drugs, flora's contribution in preventing and treating diseases cannot be ignored. At the beginning of the 21st century, it was reported that 11% of the 252 drugs regarded as vital by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and about 25% of drugs prescribed worldwide were solely derived from plants (Rates, 2001). Furthermore, 49% of 877 new chemical entities introduced between 1981 and 2002 were natural products, semi-synthetic natural products or mimics based on natural-products (Newman et al., 2003). As shown in Figure 1.2, there was an increasing trend in natural product patents worldwide whereas Table 1.1 lists the percentage of identified medicinal plant species in selected countries and the world in general.400-1Cl*PS 20: -1 0 0 -# Total woHdwide natural-product patents [H Original natural-product patentsT384 1985 1986 1997 1 998 1939 1993 1991 1992 1933 1994 1 935 1 936 1997 1993 1999 2*000 2C01 2002 20C6Fig 1.2. Worldwide pharmaceutical natural product patents. Original natural product patents refer to all firsttime grants o f patents for novel composition o f small molecule natural products as pharmaceuticals. Whereas those for total worldwide natural products are global grants for patents asserting composition-of-matter or small natural products applications as therapeutics. One single natural product can generate several patents based on multiple filings in different countries or for different indications. (Adopted from Koehn & Carter,2005. )Copy I3Y.

This is especially true in areas where there are insufficient synthetic leads. Furthermore, plants have utilised a more holistic tactic in their biochemical defence against pathogens by producing arrays of structurally and functionally diverse anti- pathogenic compounds that act in concert, not only to neutralise the threat but also in averting the development o f resistance in the future. For example, Berheris fremontii (Fremont barberry) produces both anti-microbial berberine alkaloid and inhibitors of a bacterial pump that strongly potentiate the activity of berberines (Hsiang & Lewis, 2000). It is for the same reason that made herbal medicines appealing not only to the scientific community but also to the public, where multi-factorial nature of many complex diseases such as psychiatric disorders and cancers cannot be ideally solve with a 'single golden molecular bullet'. Most of these diseases are not a result o f one single factor but from a combination of genetic, behavioural and environmental influences. Furthermore, many proteins and molecular targets are involved in complex biochemical and cellular processes. Thus, carelessly tampering with one reaction might affect the others.Pharmacognosy (derived from Greek words pharmakon, 'remedy', and gignosco, 'knowledge') is the science of biogenic or nature-derived pharmaceuticals and poisons. It concerns all medicinal plants including those yielding complex mixtures, those used in the crude forms or extracts (phytotherapy), pure compounds such as morphine, and foods having additional health benefits (nutraceuticals). Phytomedicines generally refer to herbal medicinal products used in phytotherapy. Phytotherapy should not be confused with other \"special therapeutic disciplines\" that also utilise plant materials such as anthroposophy and homeopathy. Homeopathy, whose efficacy is still being critically assessed, was proposed by Samuel Hahnemann and works on the principle o f 'similia similibus curentur'- similarCopy I4Y. SharifuddinChapter Isymptoms are healed by similar medicines. Furthermore, homeopathy mainly involves really low doses where 'efficacy' is believed to increase with dilutions, in stark contrast to current scientific comprehension.There are various ways in which plants can be used as therapeutics as listed in Table 1.2.Herbal teas and other homemade remedies are very popular. Crude or standardised extracts can be prepared in pills or capsules and can also be use as tinctures. Ultimately, as mentioned briefly before, successive extraction and purification procedures to isolate phytochemicals from plants of interests, that is bioactive and can be used straight away as drugs (e.g. ergotamine and digoxin) or use as leads in hemisynthetic processes.Table 1.2. A variety o f ways in which phytochemicals can be used.Drugs Primarily single active pharmaceutical compounds originating from plants.Via prescription orover-the-counterpurchases.Aspirin, vinblastine and taxol.Botanical drugs Standardised phytochemical mixtures that are clinically proven.Via prescription orover-the-counterpurchases.Hypericumperforatum.DietarysupplementsA plant component with health benefits.Over-the counter purchases.Garlic or Echinacea extract.Phytochemicals can also be use as reference models for total synthesis with well-defined pharmacological activity or structure activity relationship studies determining a prototype drug (e.g. morphine). One good example would be artemisinin. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene trioxane lactone containing a peroxide bridge that is necessary for its activity, was first isolated by Chinese researchers from Artemisia annua (sweet wormwood) and its structure was elucidated in 1979 (Klayman, 1985). Various soluble and more active forms o f artemisinin have been synthesised to combat malaria. The phytochemical and its derivatives kills Plasmodium in all stages o f life cycle by interacting with heme resulting in carbon-centred free radicals, which alkylate protein thus damaging the membrane and microorganelles o f the parasites (Meshnick, 1998). Up to this day and to the best of the author's knowledge, there are no known cases of artemisinin-resistant malaria in humansCopy 1 5Y. SharifuddinChapter 1(Balint, 2001). Figure 1.3 highlights the evolution of Artemisia annua application starting with traditional medicine to modem drug discovery and Figure 1.4 shows the similar passage of the senna plant. The variety of development and use of natural products is shown in Figure 1.5.1.2 Increasing Public Interest in Phytomedicines and PhytotherapyIt is widely accepted that there is an increasing use of phytomedicines by the general public to replace or complement allopathic medicines (Newall et al., 1996). This revival of interest in phytomedicines is largely driven by the public's increasing interest and confidence in self-medication (Blenkinsopp and Bradley, 1996). There are many reasons for the increasing popularity of phytotherapy and most likely to include the following:* Increasing consumer interest in self-medication. * Increasing consumer interest in using herbal remedies as daily supplements. * As a complementary to allopathic medicine. * The popular notion that phytomedicines are safe and natural. * Growing concern about the adverse effects of synthetic dmgs. * Disappointment with the efficacy of conventional dmgs, especially in chronic conditions. * The desire for a more natural lifestyle. * Cost factor. Herbal medications are normally available over the counter and are cheaper than prescribed modem dmgs.The world market for phytomedicines is estimated to be PS38 billion (UNCTAD, 2000). It is estimated that Europe imports about 400,000 tonnes of medicinal plants annually with Germany as the largest market and consumer of medicinal plants, spending about PS1.4 billion, followed by France with PS116 million (Masood, 1997). The UK is third in place.As highlighted in the House of Lords Select Committee's report on complementary and alternative medicine, comprehensive information on the use of herbal medicines in the UK is insufficient (House of Lords, 2000). There are several estimates available but it is difficult to make an accurate determination as many products could be categorised as foodCopy 1 600 <N1I<3*>55*= O>

SharifuddinChapter 1supplements rather than medicines mainly for regulatory purposes, effectively the public in many cases are unable to differentiate phytomedicines for dietary supplements or therapeutic applications. A report by the Mintel market research group on retail sales of licensed homeopathic, herbal remedies and essential oils showed that phytomedicines make up more than 50% of the total complementary market in the United Kingdom with estimated value of PS38 million in 1996 compared to PS27.2 million in 1991 (Mintel, 1997). However, the total market value is likely to be higher since the study excluded ginkgo and unlicensed herbal products from its analysis.Another report estimated the phytomedicines market to be over PS60 million (Mintel, 2000).More recent reports estimated the market value of herbal remedies (excluding traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines) had grown to PS75 million in 2002, dominating the UK natural health market and accounting for almost 60% of the sector value (Mintel, 2003).Another Mintel report in 2005 noted that herbal medicines have shown greatest growth over the last two years with value sales hitting PS87 million in 2004, accounting for half of overall category sales. All these estimates should be considered as broad brush since some companies might not always have an accurate view as to which of their products would be classified as medicines.The analysis of the market structure for unlicensed phytomedicines is complicated by several factors such as:* Most phytomedicines possess borderline status as to whether they should be categorised as medicines or fall within other regulatory classification such as supplements, cosmetics or general consumer products. * A number of companies supply herbal ingredients (e.g. for herbalists' use or by manufacturers) rather than manufacture the product themselves. * Under existing regulations, companies are not required to submit products to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for determining their status.One must recognised the fact that future growth in the industry remains vulnerable to adverse publicity arising from issues over the safety and quality of phytomedicines.Copy 1 10Y. SharifuddinChapter 11.3 The Regulation of Phytomedicines in the United Kingdom and the European UnionThe House of Lord's Select Committee on Science and Technology 6th report (2000) stressed for a need of a more effective guidance to the public regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicines. The absence of central information provision for healthcare practitioners and the general public, effectively gave the media and other unregulated information sources unchecked influence in shaping opinions in the field. Over 25% of consumers believed that pharmacists should provide more information on herbal medicines highlighting increasing consumer concern, with about 20% of consumers worried about the possible side-effects from alternative medications (Mintel, 2003).Whilst the government and the industry need to address this consumer concern, Mintel's report also found that around 1 in 5 UK consumers worry about the possible side effects from standard medication too. And 18% admitted they have tried conventional medicine which did not work, suggesting a significant opening for the phytomedicine industry (Mintel, 2003).Phytomedicines intended for general retail sale reach the UK market by two different routes. First, an authorisation can be obtained from the licensing authority for marketing purposes under the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisation Use) Regulations 1994 (SI3144\/1994) that fundamentally transposed European Directive 2001\/83\/EC into UK law. Under these Regulations, authorisation is requisite for most industrially produced medicines that are to be marketed. Such authorisation is obtained by providing standards of quality, efficacy and safety.Alternatively, exemption from product licence requirement (compulsory under the Medicines Act) can be obtained under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 [and regulation 1(3) of the 1994 Regulations] for phytomedicines that do not need marketing authorisation, providing that the remedy meets various conditions. There are restrictions or prohibitions on certain ingredients, but generally there are no specific requirements for quality, safety and efficacy. Written medical claims are not permitted for these herbal remedies and specific requirement to provide the consumers with systematic information about the safe application of the product is absent.Copy 1 11Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Even though several hundred phytomedicines posses marketing permission in the UK, most herbal medicines were marketed on general sale by utilising the exemption provided in Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act as explained above.The primary piece of European legislation is Directive 2001 \/83\/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code regarding medicinal products intended for human use. Thus, there was no distinction in the European legislation for medicines made from non-herbal ingredients and phytomedicine. Medicinal products are also subjected to some non-specific legislation, such as Directive 85\/374\/EEC on product viability, which was transposed into the UK law as Consumer Protection Act 1987 and applies in part to medicinal products for consumer protection.On 30th October 2005, the MHRA introduced a new scheme, the Traditional Herbal Medicines Registration Scheme implemented through the Medicines (Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2005 (SI 2005 No. 2750), which is required by the European Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products 2004\/24\/EC. This scheme will assist in protecting public health, consumer confidence and the industry itself by requiring specific standards to be met relating to the product namely quality, safety, manufacturing standards, patient information, wholesale and import. However, the key feature of this scheme is the requirement for evidence of traditional application in the EU for 30 years. Evidence for up to 15 years of traditional applications outside the Union is admissible. This new EU Directive effectively amends Directive 2001\/83\/EC, to introduce the scheme and applies many existing requirements of the later to traditional herbal medicinal products. Another separate new EU Directive 2004\/27\/EC is simultaneously amending Directive 2001\/83\/EC. All manufactured traditional herbal medicines that marketed with exemption under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act, will be required to be registered under this new scheme.However, for unlicensed herbal medicines that were legally on the market by 30 April 2004, Her Majesty's Government has opted for a seven-year transitional period that ends on 30 April 2011, a flexibility accorded to EU member States under Directive 2004\/24\/EC intended to allow companies to adjust to the new regulations.Copy 1 12Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Herbal products that are not classified as medicines are still subject to other regulations. The fact that a product is not medicinal in nature thus not necessarily means that it is safe or acceptable from a legal standpoint. Food and supplements are regulated by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) while cosmetics or other consumer products fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Industry. The MHRA accepts no responsibilities on these points. The Food Safety Act (1990) states that food sold in the United Kingdom cannot be injurious to health and according to the FSA, herbal ingredients that do not possess a history of significant consumption within the European Union prior to May 1997 may be subject to Novel Food Regulation (EC) 258\/97.1.4 The Importance of Natural Products and PhytomedicinesNatural products have enjoyed an undisputedly important role as new chemical entities (NCEs). Between the years 1981 and 2002, approximately 28% of NCEs were natural products or derived from natural products, with another 20% were considered as synthetics based on natural product pharmacophores (Newman et al., 2003).Natural products (phytochemicals) have many common structural features such as chiral centres, degree of molecule saturation, complex ring systems and aromatic rings that have been demonstrated to be highly applicable in drug discovery process (Koehn & Carter, 2005). Furthermore, the realisation that combinatorial chemistry may not always provide high degree of compound diversity led to the exploration of combining the natural product and natural product-like libraries with the potential of combinatorial chemistry in drug discovery and Table 1.3 shows some of the well-known phytochemicals in use today.The existence and application of new technologies such as combinatorial synthesis, genomics and screening technology allow new research and development strategies to be adopted and contributed to revival of interest in phytochemicals. Table 1.4 listed some phytochemicals with their known molecular targets which might pave the way for better comprehension on their mode of action(s) and possible development into clinically applicable drugs.Copy 1 13Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Table 1.3.

In May 2007, another pharmaceutical heavyweight, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) announced the establishment of its own drug research and development facility in Shanghai, China (Corporate Press Releases,Copy I1 4Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Novartis and GSK respectively, 2007). Embracing phytochemicals again and re-designing strategies for discovering new molecules from plants including studying those described in traditional medicine texts such as in China, is understandable since the new chemical entities pipeline of pharmaceutical companies were reported to be at historically low levels (Bolten & DeGregorio, 2002).1.5 The Efficacy of PhytomedicinesThe extraordinary level of phytomedicines popularity in recent years made it ethically imperative to elucidate its efficacy. There were opinions that the criteria for efficacy as well as safety of herbal medicines should be on par as those for conventional medicines and the author concur with these views. Many phytomedicines possess a long history of traditional use but most are of unproven efficacy by acceptable scientific standards, and traditional use does not necessarily confer safety usage mark. Insufficient evidence does not mean that phyomedicines are unsafe and ineffective, but that rigorous scientific investigation has not been carried out. Base on the same line of argument, the lack of evidence cannot be use to justify that all phytomedicines are safe.The accepted 'gold standard' for testing the efficacy of medicines, whether it is synthetic or herbal, is the randomised clinical trials. Depending on the research objectives, these trials can be conducted against reference medications should one exists, or against placebo or no treatment at all. There is good evidence of efficacy for some phytomedicines but usually such an evaluation is scientifically inadequate. Figure 1.6 shows the percentage of randomised clinical trials highlighting the benefit of phytomedicines based on 50 trials with 10 herbal medicines for 18 therapeutic indications, where only 34% exhibited benefit when compared against placebo and 18% showed the same activity as placebo. Almost half (48%) of the results from the trials has an unlikely benefit due to discrepancies in experimental design or data analysis.Copy 7 15Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Percentage of randomised trials showing benefit of phytomedicines# Same as compared to placebo # Benefit as compared to placebo# Benefit reported unlikely - due to design or analytic flawFig. 1.6. Percentage o f randomised trials showing benefit o f phytomedicines. Based on data in Herbal Medicines: an evidence-based look. (Therapeutics Letter, Issue 25, June-July 1998. )However, in order to provide a fair estimate of overall efficacy of a particular herbal medication, relying on the data generated from randomised trials alone is not sufficient. Only the totality of the available data that can be achieved by performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses can provide the most reliable evidence while minimising bias and random error. Determining the efficacy of an herbal product against its safety is important.1.6 Safety of Phytomedicines: Clear and Hidden RisksThe advances in organic chemistry, biological and medical sciences in the 20th century had paved the way for the introduction and consumption of powerful synthetic drugs, resulting in the decline of phytomedicines usage in modern medicine. However, the current revival of interest in phytotherapy had caused the pharmaceutical industry to start marketing an increasing amount o f new phytomedicines to accommodate the needs o f consumers. This makes the need to ensure the quality, efficacy and safety of phytomedicines even more pressing since these products are generally self-prescribed, used to treat minor and oftenCopy \/1 6Y. SharifuddinChapter 1chronic conditions. The assumption that they only possess beneficial effects has proven to be inaccurate.Furthermore, traditional medicines have developed in many different regions, having been very much influenced by historical conditions and local cultures within which they first evolved. Thus, there has been no parallel development of methods and standards, both at national or international level that are suitable for evaluation purposes.Safety evaluation of phytomedicines is difficult. Identifying plants accurately is essential as well as isolation of active ingredients, which is far more complex since the properties of phytochemicals are influenced by several factors such as environmental conditions. A single medicinal plant can also contain hundreds of phytochemicals and elucidating the individual effect of each can therefore be prohibitively expensive. Unsurprisingly, research effort has been inadequate, resulting in inadequate methodology development and paucity of reliable data. Although many phytomedicines showed promising potential and are increasingly used, many of them are untested and their use by the public not properly monitored leading to limited knowledge of their side-effects. Benefit-risk assessment can also be difficult due to insufficient information in several areas relevant to safety."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:11:47.560457Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T10:18:03.588861Z","inner_id":3,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":4,"annotations":[{"id":4,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3955,"end":3966,"text":"hypokalemia","labels":["Medical

proper development of legislation and regulation of herbal medicines has been impaired at the public expense.Generally, data are currently lacking on:* The active constituents and\/or metabolites* Pharmacology* Pharmacokinetics* Toxicology* Possibilities of drug-herb interactions, as well as interactions with food and alcohol* Frequency of possible adverse effects, and effects of long term use* Possible effects in specific patient groups e.g. children, the elderly* Possible effects for use during pregnancy and lactationCopy 1 17Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Insufficient data on the factors stated above also makes it hard to compare and contrast the risk-benefit profile of several phytomedicines with that of conventional drugs, where effectiveness has been reported.Toxicity related to the use of phytomedicines may have multiple causes but generally can be divided into two distinguishable categories as highlighted in Tables 1.5 and 1.6 respectively. The first category can be designated as extrinsic or non-plant associated, where toxic effects or adverse reactions occurred due to accidental or deliberate substitution or contamination of the plant material described on the label. On the other hand, the second category is more intrinsic or plant-associated in nature. In this category, the plant material itself or the phytochemicals present, thus an active agent in the herbal medicinal products, which causes the health risks.Table 1.5. Extrinsic or non-plant-associated causative factors involved in adverse drug reactions.Adulteration* Accidental or deliberate substitution of the original plant material by other plant speciesContamination* Micro-organisms (bacteria including Salmonella, E.coli, yeasts, moulds)* Microbial toxins (aflatoxins, lipopolysaccharides)* Heavy metals (mercury, lead, etc. )* Pesticides and\/or herbicides* Fumigants* Radioactive particlesSubstitution* Synthetic drugs (anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids etc. )* Animal substances (enzymes, hormones etc. )Copy 1 18Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Table 1.6. Intrinsic or plant-associated causative factors; health risks related to the medicinal herb itself as active ingredient in the phytomedicine. * Use of plants containing constituents that are known to affect bioavailability and\/or pharmacokinetics of other compounds or drugs* Ignored toxicity of plant constituent(s) present in the product* Use of plants, either as raw material or in processed form, of which at present no or insufficient data regarding safety are available* Use of highly concentrated or specifically processed extractsAlthough the number of side effects attributed to the use of phytomedicines represents only a small proportion of the total amount of adverse drug reactions in the WHO database (Barnes, 1998), reports on toxic effects of or adverse reactions to herbal preparations have regularly been published over the past years (Barnes, 1998). Proponents of phytotherapy usually present long-standing experience in traditional medicine as evidence of their safety, unfortunately this type of evidence has considerable deficiencies. Determining botanicals that contain phytochemicals, which manifest their toxicities and acute adverse effects in a large fraction of users is relatively easy. A 5-year toxicological study by the UK National Poisons Unit from 1991 to 1995 on potentially serious adverse reactions attributed to exposure to herbal remedies, showed there were 785 cases of possible or definitive positive poisoning out of 1297 inquiries (Shaw et al., 1997). Although the study concluded that the overall risk to public health was low, there were clusters of cases that deserve serious attention where there were 21 incidents of hepatotoxicity including two deaths due to the use of traditional medicines although no causative agent was identified.The harder task is recognising subtle adverse effects that develop over time and occur infrequently, for example hypokalemia from the use of anthranoid laxatives (Blumenthal, 1998), or that are readily ascribed to an underlying disease such as hepatitis from celandine, a bile duct remedy derived from Chelidonium majus (Benninger et al., 1999). Hypothetically, for a herb that caused an adverse reaction in 1 for every 1000 users, a traditional practitioner would have to prescribed the herb to 4800 patients, that is 1 new user per day for more than 18 years, in order to obtain a 95% probability of observing such reaction in more than 1 user (De Smet, 1995).Copy 1 19Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Thus, the more chronic but subtle form of toxicity such as mutagenicity and carcinogenicity effects of phytochemicals will remain unrecognised if their applications in traditional settings were left unexamined, as these may have been undetermined by previous generations. For example, although Aristolochia fangchi have been used for centuries in Chinese traditional medicine, its nephrotoxicity and potential to induce urothelial carcinoma by DNA-adduct formation has only recently been elucidated (Nortier|| et al., 2000; Lord et al., 2001) and it was the same case with the hepatotoxicity potential of| Piper methysticum (Escher et al., 2001). !IfFurthermore, there is always a belief among the general public that herbal medicines orj supplements are safe primarily because they are derived from nature, compared to syntheticj| compounds. Therefore, it was often considered harmless by the public that the consumption of these herbal products would not cause profound injury directly or vice-versa. Herb-drugs interactions for example, can occur at the pharmaceutical, pharmacodynamic and\/or pharmacokinetic levels (Beijnen & Schellens, 2004). The application of herbal medicines in combination with conventional therapeutics may increase the risk for undesired interactions primarily due to the narrow therapeutic window of many oncolytic drugs.| Alarmingly, more than 72% of cancer patients in the US for example, failed to inform theirij doctors about herbal products consumption when undergoing conventional therapy at the| same time (Sparreboom et al., 2004). One of the well-known examples of a clinicallysignificant effect displayed by herbs on the pharmacokinetic of chemotherapeutic drugs is Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort), which is popular among cancer patients due to its suggested activity on mild to moderate levels of depression (Mathijssen et al., 2002). The plasma levels of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan was 42% lower in cancer patients who took Hypericum at the same time. Co-administration of cyclosporin with Hypericum leads to decrease cyclosporin plasma concentration (Barone et al., 2000) and disrupts hormonal contraception with irregular bleeding when taken together with ethynylestradiol (Schwarz et al., 2003). Even the innocently looking grapefruit (iCitrus paradisi) juice, has been shown to caused 26.2% reduction in etoposide bioavailability (Reif et al., 2002) and the culprit is bergamottin, a major furanocoumarin that reversibly inhibited the activities of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 in human liver microsomes (He et al., 1998), which may last up to 24 hours. It also alters the concentration of many drug substrates for CYP3A4 when taken simultaneously (Quo et al.,2000). These examples highlight the need for more research not only into direct detrimentalCopy 1 20Y. Sharifuddinj Chapter 1effects pose by phytochemicals but also indirect effects or impacts that are not clearly manifested including mutations and metabolic enzymes manipulation. The public may not | be aware of these hidden risks due to the 'naturally safe' paradigm long held about herbaliproducts.Although phytomedicines are not devoid of risk, they could still be safer than synthetic drugs. Currently, the relative safety of phytomedicines is undefinable, many existing data indicate that adverse reactions, especially serious ones, occur less frequently than with prescribed synthetic drugs. Kava {Piper methysticum), an herbal anxiolytic (Pittler & Ernst,2003) that raised serious concern due to its hepatotoxicity effect, could be safer than benzodiazepines, according to preliminary data (Schulze et al., 2003) and herbal I antidepressant St. John's wort {Hypericum perforatum), has only about half the rate ofI possible adverse reactions compared to conventional antidepressants (Linde et al, 1996;Stevinson & Ernst, 1999). However, its use is only recommended for weak and mild | depression and was found not to be effective for major depression cases compared to| placebo (Linde et al., 1996; Shelton et al., 2001; Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group,i1 2002) The World Health Organization's monitoring centre collected 8985 reports ofj adverse reaction events associated with phytomedicines from 55 countries between 1968! and 1997 (Farah & Edwards, 2000). Even though this figure may seem impressively high,jit amounts to only a small fraction of adverse events associated with synthetic drugs held in I the same database (Farah & Edwards, 2000). However, one must recognise the fact thatrelative paucity could also be due to a relatively higher level of underreporting due to the perceived safety of natural herbs among the general population and more conclusive evidence on the relative safety risks of phytomedicines against conventional drugs is scarce.Copy I 21Y. SharifuddinChapter 11.7 Plants and Secondary MetabolitesAs briefly stated before, plants have evolved various defence mechanisms including chemical, mechanical or even mimicry to improve their survival and reproduction by reducing the impact of herbivory and infection. Over billions of years of evolution, plants continually produce the necessary metabolites to out-manoeuvre pathogens in their local environment or to repel herbivores. If the metabolites were useful to the plant, the biosynthetic genes were retained, with subsequent genetic modifications and improving the I process yielding exotic structures rich in functional groups and stereochemistry. Chemicalidefence involved the production of organic compounds that are not essential to metabolic, photosynthetic or other physiologically crucial activities and are known as secondary metabolites. They are usually synthesised as by-products during the production of primary metabolic process and play a major role in deterring herbivores.Plants have developed various secondary metabolites and can generally be classified into three sub-groups namely nitrogen compounds (including alkaloids and glucosinolates), terpenes and phenolics.1.8 Brief Introduction to Andrographis paniculateAndrographis paniculata is a shrub that is found throughout tropical and sub-tropical Asia | and is locally known in Malaysia as 'Hempedu bumi' and 'Akar cerita bidara'. This herbaceous, annual herb is from the family Acanthaceae with a slightly, characteristic odour and an intensely bitter taste, hence commonly known as 'king of bitter'. Pictures of various parts of the plant is shown in Figure 1.7 and Table 1.7 shows the systematic position of Andrographis paniculata.Copy 1 22Y. SharifuddinChapter IFig. 1.7.

Systematic position of A. paniculataAngiospermsDicotyledonaeGamopetalaeBicarpellataePersonalesJusticieaeAcanthaceaeAndrographispaniculataCopy I2 3Y. SharifuddinChapter IThe aerial part of the herb contains several diterpenoids and diterpene glycosides especially andrographolide, a major constituent which is not less than 6% of the total diterpene lactones present and is mainly responsible for its bitter taste. Other diterpene lactones present free and in glycosidic forms include 14-deoxyandrographolide, 14-deoxy-l 1,12- didehydroandrographolide, neoandrographolide, andrographiside, deoxyandrographiside and andropanoside (Kleipool, 1952). Table 1.8 listed the reported medical properties of andrographolide or extracts obtained from the herb.Table 1.8.

Rahman et al., 1999.Coon and Ernst (2004) conducted a systematic review on the safety and efficacy of Andrographis paniculata in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. It was found that the data collectively showed that A. paniculata is superior to placebo in alleviating the subjective symptoms of uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection. The authors also found a few spontaneous reports of adverse events and A. paniculata may be a safe and efficacious treatment for the relief of symptoms of uncomplicated upper tract infection but more research is warranted. However, there were several shortcomings of the review that need to be addressed (Coon & Ernst, 2004).Copy I2 4Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Fig. 1.8. The chemical structure of andrographolide with numbered carbon positions.1.9 The Compound of Interest: Andrographolide[ Andrographolide (CAS no: 5508-58-7) with IUPAC designation 3-{2-[decahydro-6-|I hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,8a-dimethyl-2-methylene-l-napthalenyl]-ethylidene}dihydro-4-hydroxy-2(3H)-furanone is the major bioactive constituent found in various parts of Andrographis paniculata particularly in the leaves. It is a labdane diterpene harbouring a y- lactone ring attached to a decahydronapthalene ring system via an unsaturated C-2 moiety. As shown above in Figure 1.8, it contains an a-alkylidene y-butyrolactone moiety as well as three hydroxyl groups located at C-3, C-14 and C-19 with these being secondary, allylic and primary respectively. These hydroxyls are responsible for the bioactivities of andrographolide (Nanduri et al., 2004). The stereochemistry of this phytochemical has been previously elucidated with the furan ring adopting an envelope conformation whereas the twoj bicyclic rings adopt a chair conformation (Smith et al., 1982; Fujita et al., 1984; Spek et al.,I 1987). Andrographolide was considered to be the most active constituent present in A.; paniculata extract (Kumar et al., 2004; Nanduri et al., 2004)Terpenes are ubiquitous in nature and occur in most species including humans and are sometimes referred to as isoprenes due to a common repetitive structural motif, the branched5-carbon (C5) unit or isopentane skeleton that is comparable to isoprene. They are a good example of a class of natural compound where many members are chiral, structurally diverse and have many functional group chemistry. Terpenes contribute to many of the aromas associated with plants and range in complexity from C5 units to polyisoprenes that includes leaf waxes, latex and rubber. This class of compounds are derived from a number of extensive reactions between two C5 units namely dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) whose chemical structures are depicted in Figure 1.9. Thus,Copy 1 25Y. Sharifuddinj Chapter 1the products of these reactions shall possess multiples of five carbons (C5). DMAPP and IPP1 are biosynthesised from two sources, either deoxyxylulose phosphate or mevalonic acid.I| (a) (b) (c); Fig. 1.9. Chemical structure of (a) isoprene, (b) dimethylalyll pyrophosphate and (c) isopentenyl pyrophosphate.The simplest of terpenes are hemiterpenes (C5) produced by modification reactions to either ; IPP or DMAPP and include simple acids such as angelic acid and tiglic acid, which are i structural isomers and form esters with many natural products. The complexity of structure | then progresses to monoterpenes with 10-carbon skeleton (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15),jj diterpenes (C20), triterpenes and steroids (C3o-derived) and tetraterpenes (C40, also known as 1 carotenoids).j| Diterpenes are widely distributed in plant resins and latex, some can be quite toxic. The|i presence of diterpenes in Rhododendron sp. leaves rendered them poisoinous. Diterpenes are|formed by the reaction of a 15-carbon chain, famesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) with IPP, which is the common basic unit of all terpenes with the first step of this reaction yields famesyl j allylic cation. This cation then reacts with IPP causing stereospecific loss of a proton forming I geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:11:47.561499Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T10:20:26.077723Z","inner_id":4,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":5,"annotations":[{"id":5,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":830,"end":840,"text":"anticancer","labels":["Medicinal

Depending on subsequent reactions, a simple precursor geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate can produce diverse biologically active polycyclic compound.

(Diagram obtained from the Sloan-Kettering Institute official website accessible via www.mskcc.org).High purity andrographolide which is easily obtained commercially was chosen for this study rather than extract from the plant itself. Furthermore, of all phytochemical components identified from A. paniculata, andrographolide was shown to be the most active (Kumar et al., 2004; Nanduri et al., 2004)It is estimated that 40% of plants extracts lack reproducibility of activity (Cordell, 2000) and this is one of the primary obstacles in incorporating flora in pharmaceutical discovery process, despite the diversity o f phytochemicals available. The data generated often do not replicate when sampling and extraction procedures were repeated. Different locations, climates, micro-environments, chemical stimuli and physical stresses, known as elicitors, will affect the content of phytochemicals in quantitative and qualitative manner since the biochemical pathways involved in the biosynthesis o f these bioactive compounds are highly inducible. This is especially true for terpenoids, where levels usually increase up to three orders of magnitude following elicitation (Turlings & Tumlinson, 1992; Trapp & Croteau, 2001). Recently, Bhan et al. (2006) showed the production of andrographolide, neo- andrographolide and 14-deoxy andrographolide from 10 different accessions was susceptibleCopy I2 7Y. Sharifuddin| Chapter 1\\\\| to intrinsic factors such as genotype and ontogeny as well as external factors (elicitors),I which supported previous finding by Pholphana et al. (2004). Other compounds that often ! exhibit the same propensity are phenylpropanoids and alkaloids. Furthermore, the presence I of polyphenols and pigments in complex plant extracts can interfere with the activity of j bioactive compounds.Another important factor is the lack of rapid and efficient methods in isolating and characterising phytochemicals, particularly if they are only present in trace amounts. It usually requires almost 6 months isolating and characterising compounds from a plant extract. This does not include the production of standardised extracts. Cultivation and harvesting times will also affect total yield of andrographolide (Polphana et al., 2004; BhaniI et al., 2006) and the fact that A. paniculata is an annual herb must also be taken into account.| Furthermore, only a standardised extract is ideal for experiments. Thus, employing extracts | for experiments within the time limit for this PhD was not feasible.Other argument that can be put forward is that by studying one potentially beneficial phytochemical at a time, in this case andrographolide, more understanding can be gained on | many aspects of that particular bioactive compound, in contrast to working with standardised | extract where the level of qualitative understanding can be limited. Taxol (paclitaxel), anS important diterpene isolated from Taxus (T. bacata and T. brevifolia) which exhibited anti-!| tumour activity, is a good example. The main impediment to its wide clinical use is the ! sourcing of the compound. To obtain 2.5kg of taxol, approximately 12,000 of T. brevifolia ; must be cut down (Wall & Wani, 1996). Thus, an alternative source must be sought, either from hemi-synthetic production or an analogue from other Taxus species. This task would be both scientifically inappropriate and economically unfeasible if the whole extract is examined rather than potentially beneficial individual compounds.On the other side of the coin, isolating an active compound may exclude other pharmacologically relevant phytochemicals. This is particularly true when pharmacological activity is a result of pharmacokinetic influences and\/or pharmacodynamic synergism of more than one bioactive compound. Ginkgolides A, B, C, and M from Ginkgo biloba is a good example.Copy 1 28Y. Sharifuddin| Chapter 1| 1.10 Genotoxicity Information on A. paniculata extracts and AndrographolideIi| Realising the medical potential of A. paniculata, particularly androrapholide which is the I major active compound, genotoxicity testing is crucial. There are no existing genotoxicity | studies published, to the best of the author's knowledge at the time of study, especially | recommended tests for genotoxic potential such as in vitro cytokinesis block micronucleus assay (CBMA). Furthermore, the toxic effects of this plant are not well known.| However, Liu et al. (1990) suggested that the extract of the aerial parts are not mutagenic in vitro. This suggestion is questionable since water extract was used instead of alcohol-based j extract. Most of the experimental pharmacological studies mentioned previously utilised | either alcohol-based or dried extract of the aerial parts or purified andrographolide. Gupta etj| al. (1990,1993) demonstrated that the aqueous extract of the aerial parts was not active iniexerting anti-diarrhoeal activity. Yin et al. (1991) tested the aqueous extract of A. paniculata with the Ames test utilising Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 as well as chromosomal aberration assays in mice did not find a positive result on genotoxicity. However, it must be pointed out that even with plant extracts that yielded positive results, there was noticeable discrepancy in results obtained from the mammalian chromosomal aberration and micronucleus assay with those from the Ames test. Usually, the results obtained from mammalian in vivo tests will outweigh those derived from bacterial test system in vitro. In the study conducted, the coherence between the two was low (Yin et al.,2001). Furthermore, Yin et al. (1991) justified the extraction method employed in the study as to simulate the traditional practice conducted in preparing extract for oral medication. As | has been pointed earlier, aqueous extract of A. paniculata are not ideal for experiment ; because the diterpene lactones such as andrographolide, are sparingly soluble in water compared to methanol or chloroform (O'Neil et al., 2001) therefore reducing the bioavailability of the compound to the target in this case DNA. Thus, aqueous extract of j andrographolide is unable to provide an accurate picture of genotoxicity. Another important | aspect that needs to be considered is the suitability of using bacterial test system such as the Ames test, since the extract of A. paniculata appeared to have antibacterial activity (Singha et j a\/., 2003).A standardised dried extract of A. paniculata did not produce reproductive toxicity in male | Sprague-Dawley rats. There was no sign of testicular toxicity with the treatment of 20, 200II Copy1 29| Y. Sharifuddin| Chapter 1\\and lOOOmg\/kg body weight for 60 days as evaluated by testicular histology, testosterone levels, reproductive organ weight and ultrastructural analysis of Leydig cells (Burgos et al.,1997). However, the paper mainly concentrated on histological evaluation and no observation was made on the possibilities of genotoxicological effects of the compound examined. Furthermore, it is known that testicular histology is subjective and not quantitative in testicular toxicity evaluation. Akbarsha and Murugaian (2000) demonstrated that the treatment of andrographolide to male Wistar albino rats at 25mg and 50mg\/kg body weight for 48 days resulted in decreased sperm counts, immotile spermatozoa with several of them possessing abnormalities, limited number of fully differentiated spermatozoa, the disruption of the seminiferous tubules and seminiferous epithelium as well as vacuolated Sertoli cells.The Leydig cells did not show any pathological change and supported the finding made by Burgos et al. (1997) but there were spermatotoxic effects observed and possible disruption(s) to spermatogenesis.Andrographolide extract did not cause significant reduction in progesterone concentration in pregnant rats and at therapeutic dose, is incapable of inducing progesterone-mediated termination of pregnancy (Panossian et al., 1999). However, the extract of A. paniculata should not be used during pregnancy or lactation due to potential antagonism with endogenous progesterone (Panossian et al., 1999). To the best of the author's knowledge, the teratogenicity effect of the herb has not been evaluated to this date.As a brief summary, Figure 1.11 overleaf illustrated the factors that are involved in the revival of interest in phytomedicines and the imperative needs for more information on their safety and efficacy.Copy I 30Y.

SharifuddinChapter 1CHAPTER 1PART 2: INTRODUCTION TO THE GENETIC TOXICOLOGY IN MAMMALIAN CELLS AND ITS IMPORTANCE1.11 Brief Introduction to Genetic ToxicologyParacelsus first described the 'wasting disease of miners' in 1567 based on his observations in Austrian and other several European mines in the Middle Ages. He later suggested that the exposure to realgar (arsenic sulphide) and other natural ores might have been the culprit in causing this condition, which is today known as cancer. Although this type of cancer was eventually attributed to radioactivity emitted from decay products of radon gas rather than arsenic, Paracelsus was among the first to consider chemical compounds as potential carcinogens.The study of chemical mutagenesis began in the early 1940s when Charlotte Auerbach and colleagues discovered that mustard gas, a chemical warfare agent used against soldiers in trenches during the First World War was capable of causing genetic mutation in fruit fly, Drosophila (reviewed by Beale, 1993). Since then and for the next three decades, most experiments were performed on mice or flies to study chemically-induced mutation. Eventually, better test systems based on yeast and bacteria were developed where data can be obtained cheaper and quicker than using flies or mice. Furthermore, the inclusion of liver extracts and cofactors allowed the detection of more mutagenic agents and highlight the importance of biotransformation in mutagenesis studies. Then, in 1973 Bruce Ames successfully showed that various chemical carcinogens induced mutation in the genetically- engineered Salmonella typhimurium bacteria (Ames et al., 1973), known today as the Ames test which has been widely used to screen potential cancer-causing agents.Genotoxic agents are rather ubiquitous in the environment whether they are man-made products or found naturally. Many synthetic chemicals employed in manufacturing industry,X-rays developed for medical diagnosis and carcinogenic hydrocarbons in coal tar or smelters are examples of genotoxic compounds of man-made in origin. Even the way of howCopy 1 32Y. SharifuddinChapter 1food is being prepared such as grilling red meat at high temperatures are known to yield potent mutagens. Naturally occurring agents include aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus | that grows on nuts and isothiocyanates, the mutagenic phytochemicals found in cruciferousivegetables. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals that are endogenously produced as a result of cellular metabolism are also known to be genotoxic. Figure 1.12 shows the mechanisms of actions of DNA and non-DNA reactive genotoxicants.Genetic toxicology is a broader term than chemical mutagenesis, dedicated to the study of genetic damage, the physical and chemical agents that are responsible, the mechanism involved for it as well as the cellular and organisms' responses to this injury. Since the potential consequences of genetic damage include birth defects and cancer, the elucidation of novel substances' potential to elicit DNA damage and genome instability is an important step in the development of new medicines and other products intended for human use. Various endpoints can be employed in assessing genotoxic damage and they are shown in Figure 1.13.1.12 Biotransformation of XenobioticsAll organisms are constantly exposed to foreign chemicals and these can be man-made (drugs, industrial chemicals) or naturally occurring compounds from the environment.Uptake is usually via ingestion, however inhalation and transdermal routes are also possible.Due to the lipophilicity of many chemicals that facilitate their uptake via these routes, organisms have evolved mechanisms to increase their hydrophilicity for rapid excretion via bile and urine. Otherwise, the accumulation of these xenobiotics will overwhelm defense mechanisms and disrupt systemic homeostasis. This process is known as biotransformation and is catalysed by various enzymes primarily in the liver of higher organisms but are also present in other organs such as the gut, kidneys and lungs.Plants have been known to be one of the reasons for the evolution of biotransformation in animals. Most animals are plant-eaters and customarily being bombarded by various secondary metabolites which play a role in plants' defence mechanisms. However, many chemicals can also be transformed into more reactive metabolites. In pharmacology for example, the metabolites of some parent drugs impose the desired therapeutic effect but inCopy 1 33(r)c<N.5&V. ?s>3d) DOJ) F*Irt al Mo *-- eofi ww) PS~o Of)5b \"35 <u<--* O e i^3 OJ0> csM'7*>>l r. jClJ ^ c<3Z EO C3 w -Os <&*Z << Qr 00<< .S PS 2 * 3<teftsflBIn esVfi.O#*-<w,15 r- ^*\" O *-# ~ CJ-C -- '*#5 >, oO #PS o<L>Y.

Different compounds will possess varying effects due to the length of time they remain in the organism. A compound that is toxicologically very active but is extremely hydrophilic will be easily excreted from the body without the possibility of inducing severe damage in contrast to relatively low activity compound that is hydrophobic but lingers longer in the body and could potentially be more harmful. Biotransformation will be discussed in greater length in Part 2 of the second Chapter in this thesis.I| Various pro-mutagenic and pro-carcinogenic compounds require metabolic activation before| they can exert their effect and typical cell culture techniques do not often maintain the[ metabolic capacity of the liver. Accordingly, the addition of S9-fraction of liver homogenateinto cell cultures in vitro was intended to provide an external metabolic capability. The creation of cell lines for genotoxicology applications, which have been genetically engineered to be metabolically competent such as AHH-1 and MCL-5 serve as an alternative ! to the addition of S9-fraction, thus permitting the assessment of xenobiotics that needjbioactivation.1.13 The Cycle of Cell DivisionCells proliferate in response to extracellular growth factors, passing through a repeated sequence of events known as the cell cycle. This has four major phases: Gi, then S, G2 and lastly the mitotic or M-phase. This is followed by division of the cytoplasm and plasma membrane to produce two daughter cells. Gi, S and G2 together constitute interphase, which is the majority of the cell cycle. During interphase, the cytoplasm increase in volume, the DNA is uncoiled then diffuse within the nucleus and is a stage of general growth where ribosomes, mitochondria and other cellular proteins are synthesise.

The program contains a knowledge base of structure-metabolism relationships and each describes a metabolic reaction, characteristic of xenobiotics with a common structural feature. METEOR reasoning rule-base contains 841 rules, 217 mammalian Phase I and II biotranformations allowing the program to evaluate the relative probabilities of various metabolic pathways (Langowski & Long, 2002). Results are accompanied by comments and literature citations as evidence that is specific, making evaluations easier. The strength of METEOR lies in its ability to predict the metabolites that are likely to be generated rather than all possible candidates (Greene et al., 1999).In certain circumstances, experimental data from metabolism studies discloses empirical formula of metabolites and not their molecular structure, which effectively impair a thorough assessment of the possible chemical properties such as toxicity possess by the metabolites since different molecular structure denotes different activities. The program is capable of recommending the most likely molecular structure and even anticipates different promising structures from the same empirical formula.

Testing against all biotransformations.2. Absolute reasoning used: True.3. Phase: Do not grow from phase II products.4. Species: mammals5. Likelihood at least: Plausible.6 . Hydrogen options: perceive implicit and explicit hydrogens.2.11 RESULTS| The METEOR programme predicted plausible andrographolide metabolites in Phase I and| II biotransformation and the possible routes are summarised as a metabolic tree in Figurej 2.15. The data used for the tree construction were generated by METEOR and variousreactions that contributed to this process are also stated. Figure 2.17 is the same metabolicij tree but instead of empirical formula, the tree shows molecular weight. As thei| biotransformation pathway progresses, the molecular weight of the metabolites predicted| increased. Another metabolite tree shown as Figure 2.18 is essentially the same as the onei| depicted in Figure 2.15 but highlighted the Phase II reactions in blue while those that cani| be achieved by cytochrome P450 are shown in other lighter colours.Although the empirical formulae of all possible metabolites were shown in Figure 2.15, various different chemical structures can be derived from the same chemical formula, a task METEOR was equipped to handle. Due to the large size of information generated, examples of selected reactions involving the metabolism of andrographolide are shown in Figures 2.16a to 2.16f.Copy I 87Y.

SharifuddinChapter 22.12 DISCUSSIONThe metabolic tree suggested by METEOR is useful in the initial prediction of possible metabolites of andrographolide especially when there is currently a paucity of sufficient data. Figure 2.15 shows all possible metabolites derived from andrographolide, the parent compound. Various functional groups attached to the aglycone provide many possible substrates for Phase I and Phase II enzymes. The progression of the metabolic tree also showed steady increment in molecular weight and polarity of the metabolites by the addition of other groups such as glutathione and glucuronide as shown in Figure 2.17. The resultant metabolites possess higher polarity and hydrophilicity mainly attributed to the high molecular weight of the conjugates, hence facilitates their excretion from the body. As depicted both in Figures 2.17 and 2.18, the molecular size of the metabolites produced by Phase II reactions were higher that those subjected to Phase I metabolism. Indeed, the Phase II biotransformation reactions with the exception of acetylation and methylation, result in a large increase of xenobiotic hydrophilicity (Gibson & Skett, 2001). The extract of Andrographis paniculata including andrographolide and its analogues have been shown to affect hepatic biotransformation enzymes such as anilinehydroxylase, N- and O- demethylase (Choudhary & Poddar, 1984), alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (Trivedi & Rawal, 2000) as well as glutathione S-transferase and DT- diaphorase (Phase II biotransformation enzymes) (Singh et al., 2001).Several metabolites of andrographolide have also been identified in rats and humans. Ten metabolites of andrographolide mainly in the form of sulfonic acid conjugates and sulfate compounds were isolated and identified in urine, feces as well as contents of small intestine after the compound was orally administered to rats (He et al., 2003a, b, c). Cui et al. (2004) also reported structural identification of four urinary metabolites of andrographolide from human volunteers, of which three of the metabolites were categorised as 3-O-sulfate conjugates and the remaining one as 3-O-sulfate-12-S-cysteine conjugate. An additional seven Phase II metabolites were isolated from human urine and all were characterised as glucuronide conjugates, where four were found to be two pairs of geometric isomers (Cui et al., 2005). All these findings are in line with the predictions made by METEOR in terms of plausible reactions that might be involved in andrographolide metabolism where different functional groups such as primary aliphatic alcohols and epoxides are being targeted by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and glutathione S-transferases respectively.Copy 1 94Y. SharifuddinChapter 2Indeed, assessment of andrographolide structure by DEREK identified the a, p-unsaturated ester position as capable of educing chromosome damage and METEOR also suggested that this position is susceptible to conjugation with glutathione as illustrated in Figure 2.16c. Furthermore, compounds containing the a, p-unsaturated ester has been known to be metabolised via conjugation with glutathione and hydrolysis (Frederick et al., 1992; Greim et al., 1995; McCarthy & Witz, 1997)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:11:47.561499Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T10:13:08.805970Z","inner_id":6,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":7,"annotations":[{"id":7,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3805,"end":3825,"text":"Teuchrium

conjugates formed in the liver can be excreted intact in bile or they can be transformed to mercapturic acids in the kidney and excreted in urine. The conversion of glutathione conjugates to mercapturic acids requires sequential cleavage of glycine and glutamic acid from glutathione moiety subsequently followed by N-acetylation of the resulting cysteine conjugate (Gibson & Skett, 2001). Glutathione conjugation of metabolites is an important detoxification step because electrophiles for example, are known to be potentially genotoxic species and can bind to critical nucleophiles such as DNA and proteins leading to genetic mutations and cellular damage. However, in some cases, conjugation with glutathione amplifies the toxicity of a xenobiotic by being inherently toxic or being degraded into a toxic metabolite (Williams & Aruoma. 2000).As shown in Figure 2.18, andrographolide can be converted into four possible metabolites via 7 different reactions and these metabolites in turn can also be further transformed into various different metabolites. However, cellular conditions and the amounts of cofactors present for Phase II metabolism dictate the direction of biotransformation pathway. Thus, there will be major and minor andrographolide metabolites being produced depending on the circumstances. The cellular concentrations of PAPS for example (approximately 75pM), are significantly lower than those of glutathione (~10mM) and UDP-glucuronic acid (~350pM) and the relatively low concentration of PAPS limits the capacity for xenobiotic sulfonation (Gibson & Skett, 2001). The availability of UDP-glucuronic acid can also limit the rate of glucuronidation of endogenous as well as exogenous compounds especially if they are in high doses and being extensively conjugated such as acetaminophen. Figure 2.19 shows one example of possible routes for andrographolide biotransformation yielding a glutathione-conjugate.Before the Phase II biotransformation, andrographolide is susceptible to Phase I enzymes as suggested by the metabolic tree (Figure 2.18). Hydroxylation and epoxidation of doubleCopy 1 95Y. SharifuddinChapter 2bonds are two main reactions of andrographolide metabolism attributed to cytochrome P450. Even though the aglycone was predicted to be metabolised by these reactions, one cannot really ascertain whether the metabolites are more or less reactive by referring to the metabolic tree. Andrographolide is shown to be susceptible to epoxidation of the double bonds and as shown in Figure 2.16f, this epoxide group resides close to the butyrolactone moiety of the phytochemical. Although, epoxides have been known to be potentially mutagenic (Guengerich, 2003; Benigni, 2005) per se, the reactivity of epoxy- andrographolide can only be determined experimentally. Alternatively, another double bond exists within the structure at the A8(17^ position as highlighted in Figure 2.8 and is also susceptible to epoxidation according to METEOR assessment. However, the half-lives of relatively simple epoxides are known to be usually on the order of hours in the absence of added nucleophiles. Many of these simple epoxides are carcinogens when administered to rodents at high doses (Dunkelberg, 1979) whereas the evidence for human carcinogenicity such as styrene is probably equivocal at best (Yeowell-O'Connell et al, 1998). Functionalisation of epoxides with the addition of certain groups lead to enhanced reactivity such as 2 -cyanoethylene oxide that is more reactive than propylene oxide and is mutagenic (Recio et al., 1988; 2001). Butadiene diepoxide is much more reactive and genotoxic than would be expected on the statistical basis of having two epoxides (Cochrane & Skopek, 1994). A comparable example on epoxide generation in herbs is that observed in Teuchrium chamaedrys (Germander), which was once promoted as slimming products in the 1990s until hepatotoxicity cases were reported in France. The hepatotoxicity has been attributed to the diterpenoids in T. chamaedrys namely teucrin A and teuchamaedryn A.The furan ring of these diterpenoids is susceptible to oxidation by CYP3A4, which has a wide substrate spectrum, to reactive epoxides that react with proteins such epoxide hydrolase and CYP3A (Loeper et al., 1994; Lekehal et al., 1996; Fau et al., 1997; Loeper et al., 2001). The presence of these reactive epoxides led to mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and apoptosis in rat and mouse hepatocytes (Loeper et al., 1994;Lekehal et al., 1996; Fau et al 1997). It was revealed that teucrin A binds covalently to hepatocyte proteins and the furano diterpenoid part of the compound increased cytosolic^ Ilevels of Ca but decreased cellular glutathione (GSH) and cytoskeleton-associated protein thiols resulting in the formation of plasma membrane blebs and apoptosis (Lekehal et al.,1996; Fau et al 1997).Copy 1 96Y. SharifuddinChapter 2Futhermore, the epoxide functional group in andrographolide can be further converted into vicinal diols, another functional group that can be mutagenic, which may or may not increase the reactivity of andrographolide and can only be assess in laboratory studies. However, this prediction is made on the probability that these metabolic routes are the one favoured by the cellular or systemic conditions since there were other relatively safer pathways such as glucuronidation. The possibility that these metabolites are produced as minority products cannot be ruled out too. It is also important to note that the unsaturated butyrolactone site of andrographolide was predicted by DEREK as able to cause chromosome damage in mammals and whether structural transformation to this moiety will enhance or reduce the potency of such effect is not deducible without experimental data, which currently is inadequate.Recently, Jarukamjom et al. (2006) studied the impact of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of A. paniculata on mouse hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and found the extracts to significantly elevate the activities of ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) but not methoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (MROD).It was also suggested that CYP1A1 and CYP2B10 were the P450 isoforms responsive to A. paniculata extracts (Jarukamjom et al., 2006). However, the utilisation of crude extracts in the study cannot provide valuable qualitative data on the effects of individual components in the extracts on specific P450 isoforms, especially andrographolide which is a major diterpenoid present (Kleipool, 1952; Siripong et al., 1992). Furthermore, one must take into account that individual substances in the extract, as it is the case with many plant extracts, may act in an antagonistic or synergistic manner in the expression of bioactivation and detoxification pathways. Thus, another study into the effects of andrographolide on cytochrome P450 isoenzymes activities showed that the phytochemical significantly evoked the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 but not that of CYP1B1 in mouse hepatocytes in a concentration-dependent manner (Jaruchotikamol et al., 2007). The mRNA expression of CYP1A1 induced by andrographolide is higher compared to CYP1A2 but lower than that stimulated with typical CYP1A agonists such as benz(a)anthracene and p-naphthoflavone (Jaruchotikamol et al., 2007). It is known that the mechanisms of transcription regulation differ between CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 (Guengerich & Shimada, 1998) hence the dissimilarity in the expression levels observed (Jaruchotikamol et al., 2007). However, further studies involving major cytochromes such as CYP3A4 isCopy 1 97Y. SharifuddinChapter 2needed. This recent study could possibly shed more light into the reported hepatoprotective effect modulated by andrographolide.Andrographolide has been reported to be the major anti-hepatotoxic compound present in A. paniculata extract conferring protection to liver cells against toxicity induced by carbon- tetrachloride, galactosamine and acetaminophen (Handa & Sharma, 1990a; Handa &Sharma, 1990b). Since the mode of action and hence toxicity induced by galactosamine and acetaminophen are different, it was suggested that a non-specific hepatoprotective activity may be attributed to this phytochemical (Handa & Sharma, 1990b). It may be possible that andrographolide is involved in cytochrome P450 activity manipulation, effectively shielding the liver cells from cytotoxicity. After all, cytochromes 1A2, 2E1,2A6 and 3A4 have been shown to oxidise acetaminophen (paracetamol) into A-acetyl-\/?- benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) that in turn is detoxified by glutathione (GSH) resulting in the formation of acetaminophen-GSH conjugate (Patten et al., 1993; Chen et al., 1998)Although metabolic predictions made by CSAR programme such as METEOR is useful, there are several caveats to this finding. Any predictions made cannot overrule experimental data. Mammals was the chosen parameter for METEOR where no distinction was made between human and animals, thus the metabolic tree generated was not representative of any particular species but mammals in general plus there are inter- and intra-species variability in metabolic capacity. This might explain the absence of sulfonation process from the metabolic tree generated in contrary to experimental findings where sulfate conjugates were isolated (He et al., 2003a, b, c; Cui et al. 2004). Secondly, METEOR is able to suggest the most plausible molecular structure of possible metabolites but it cannot exactly determine their reactivity and toxicity, which can only be proven experimentally. This involves extraction and identification of the metabolites using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\/MS) to name a few. Subsequently, various genotoxicity studies whether in vitro and subsequently followed by in vivo if necessary, can be performed on the isolated metabolites to assess its genotoxic potential. For example, butyrylactone moiety of andrographolide was suggested to contribute to its activity but this functional group is susceptible to conjugation with glutathione and one can never be certain whether andrographolide will be more or less reactive. Finally, all of the metabolism studies cited previously merely elucidate the type of metabolites being produced by a rather small sample of healthy maleCopy 1 98Y. SharifuddinChapter 2human volunteers and rats. Although the studies did not report any adverse effects experienced by the human volunteers during the study period, this does not necessarily means that more subtle form of injury such as mutagenesis and cellular damage can be mled out despite successful extraction of more hydrophilic metabolites. Furthermore, human metabolism studies may produce metabolites from the compound of interest, which may not be observed in in vitro or animal studies and therefore may not have been thoroughly assessed for possible risk to humans. In a case where the metabolites wereconsiderably high in humans, additional testing with the metabolites or the pathwaysinvolved would be essential to properly evaluate the potential of the compound to cause genotoxicity in humans (US FDA, 2005).Therefore, METEOR was useful in determining the most plausible routes ofbiotransformation for a compound based on the application of structure-activityrelationships and meant to complement experimental data or assisting in better experimental designs. In this study, many similarities were observed between the results generated via in silico assessment of possible andrographolide metabolism pattern using METEOR and in vitro\/in vivo experiments conducted previously, thereby granting the opportunity to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of such approach. Furthermore, semi-quantitative information on metabolic fate of this phytochemical along with SAR study conducted using DEREK gave a better picture.Copy I 993CHAPTER 3ASSESSMENT OF ANDROGRAPHOLIDE GENOTOXICITY POTENTIAL USING THE IN VITRO CYTOKINESIS BLOCK MICRONUCLEUS ASSAYY. SharifuddinChapter 3CHAPTER 3ASSESSMENT OF ANDROGRAPHOLIDE GENOTOXICITY POTENTIAL USING THE IN VITRO CYTOKINESIS BLOCK MICRONUCLEUS ASSAY3.1 Micronuclei as Genotoxicity Biomarker: A Historical PerspectiveThe most often used assay in routine genotoxicity testing of xenobiotics in vitro is bacterial mutation (Ames test). However, the detection of natural and synthetic carcinogenic substances that act through a non-direct mode of DNA alteration and are negative in bacterial mutation assays requires additional test systems. Another often-used endpoint in routine testing is the induction of chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells. Alternatively, the in vitro micronucleus assay is easier to perform and is suitable to monitor genotoxicity of such compounds in mammalian cells.Micronuclei were described as \"corpuscules intraglobulaires\" by Jolly in the late 1800s and early 1900s or known as \"fragment of nuclear material\" in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes by Howell about a century ago hence these structures are known to hematologists as \"Howell- Jolly bodies\". Similar intracellular structures were described in other cell types, for example in rat and mouse embryos by Brenneke in 1937 or in Vicia faba by Thoday in 1951, and are known as \"fragment nuclei\" or \"micronuclei\". These micronuclei were consistently found after radiation exposure of cells and it was assumed that they originated from acentric fragments that were excluded from the two daughter nuclei at the late stages of mitosis. The instrumental application of micronucleus as biomarkers for cytogenetic damage was discovered by Evans et al. in 1959, while comparing the efficiency of neutrons to y-rays in Vicia faba roots.Boiler and Schmid's work paved the way for the utilisation of micronuclei as an assay system for elucidating genotoxicity potential and were first to suggest the term \"micronucleus\". Studies on bone marrow erythrocytes by Heddle also contributed to theCopy 1 100Y. SharifuddinChapter 3decisive development. Subsequently, Countryman and Heddle introduced lymphocytes as another useful cellular system for detection of chromosomal damage by the determination of micronucleus induction. They also recommended the utilisation of micronuclei as a biomarker in testing schemes.3.2 The In Vitro Cytokinesis Block Micronucleus Assay and Its ApplicationThe simplicity of scoring and wide applicability of the in vitro micronucleus test in various cell types makes it an appealing method in cytogenetic abnormality assessment. However, incomplete comprehension of micronuclei induction mechanisms and the absence of sufficient methods to concurrently assess cell proliferation and micronucleus formation, inevitably delayed the validation of the in vitro micronucleus test for genotoxicity testing.Micronuclei are small, membrane bound extranuclear bodies that arise in dividing cells from whole chromosome\/chromatids or acentric chromosome\/chromatid fragments that lag behind in anaphase and remained outside of the daughter cells' nuclei in telophase. Micronuclei are only formed during cell division regardless of the location of the actual damage that occurred during the cell cycle, either by damage to the DNA or damage to the mitotic apparatus.In the in vitro cytokinesis block micronucleus assay (CBMA) developed by Fenech and Morley (1985), cytochalasin-B is added to the cells in culture. Cytochalasin-B is a metabolite of the fungus Helminthosporium dematioideum that blocks cytokinesis but not karyokinesis and results in the formation of binucleated cells from cells that have undergone one nuclear division (Carter, 1967; Ridler & Smith, 1968). Cytochalasin-B prevents cytokinesis by binding to high-molecular-weight complexes in the plasma membrane, which is responsible in inducing actin polymerisation to form microfilaments that governs the cleavage of the dividing cell into two daughter cells. This allowed the identification of once-divided nuclei in binucleated cells and granted an efficient approach to study the mechanism leading to micronuclei formation as illustrated in Figure 3.1. With restriction on micronuclei scoring only in cells that had undergone one cell cycle, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assayCopy 1libraryY. SharifuddinChapter 3(CBMA) solved the technical predicament of possible variation in micronucleus frequency caused by modifications in the proportion of dividing cells that may occur either due to sub- optimal culture conditions or exposure to genotoxic agents (Fenech, 2000). Table 3.1 compares the in vitro CBMA and chromosomal aberration assay, which is widely used previously to assess genotoxicity.A micronucleus that contains a whole chromosome mainly results from defects in the chromosome segregation machinery such as failure of the mitotic spindle, kinetochore, or other parts of the mitotic apparatus, deficiencies in the cell cycle governing genes or by damage to chromosomal substructures, mechanical disruption (Albertini et al., 2000) as well as centromeric DNA hypomethylation (Fenech et al., 2005)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-19T10:11:47.561996Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T10:24:39.502917Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":8,"annotations":[{"id":8,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":13098,"end":13112,"text":"anti-apoptotic","labels":["Medicinal

14- days incubation period was adopted because it was the routine procedure performed previously in the laboratory (Barber et al. 2006, Doak et al., 2007).Even though the cell viability in this study was performed using equation (2), where viability was measured as part of the plating efficiency after 14-days, other methods can also be employed and the Relative Total Growth (RTG) calculation is one example. The RTG calculation depends on cell number. As stated previously, during the 14-day phenotypic expression period the cells were sub-cultured routinely on alternate days but the author inadvertently did not record the figures, since sub-culturing was performed primarily to maintain a low cell number and cell viability will be determined after another 14-days (equation 2). However, based on visual observation made by the author, the cell number showed a dose-response relationship between sub-culturing procedures and the author believes that should the Relative Total Growth were calculated for cytotoxicity, the outcome would have be the same as that observed in Figure 5.6, where the phytochemical exerted a increasing cytotoxicity with increasing concentrations. Thus, the author recommends the inclusion of Relative Total Growth (RTG) calculation as part of | cytotoxicity assessment in this assay for a more accurate measurement since cell death during the long expression period was excluded in the cell viability calculation. This may lead to underestimation of cytotoxicity.This study showed that andrographolide is able to elicit point mutations in mammalian AHH-1 cells in vitro at a concentration as low as 5pM with the highest frequency of mutants recorded at 30pM. The biological significance of this finding remains to be seen.Copy1 2126CHAPTER 6GENERAL DISCUSSIONY. SharifuddinChapter 6CHAPTER 6 GENERAL DISCUSSIONi6.1. The Objectives of the StudiesThe studies discussed in this thesis were performed to investigate the potential genotoxicity and toxicity of andrographolide, an active phytochemical found in various parts of the annual herb Andrographis paniculata.Herbal products containing phytochemicals have long been an important part and parcel of traditional medicines, that were handed down from one generation of practitioners to another over hundreds of years. The plants to be used and its applications were carefully described in various older traditional healthcare systems such in China and Ayurveda in India, which are philosophically-based and regarded to be holistic in principle, which aim to treat the patient as a whole rather than singling the disease suffered by the patient. They have much in common with traditional medical herbalism as it was and still is practised in Europe and North America.In Part 1, Chapter 1 of this thesis, various factors involved in the revival of interest in phytomedicines, current UK and EU regulations in place regarding phytomedicines, the efficacy and safety of herbal medicines were discussed in length. Furthermore, the importance of phytochemicals in drug discovery and renewed interests exhibited by the | pharmaceutical industry in concordant with the emergence of new technologies, allowing new approaches in research and development of new chemical entities isolated from plants. However, this increased interests in harnessing the hidden knowledge described in ancient medical manuscripts or those trapped within the memory of its practitioners, are not always welcome by the developing countries who claimed that they are being subjected to biopiracy. These countries have various reasons to believe so due to their rich biodiversity, local socio-economic status and the high percentage of the local population that still trust and rely on traditional herbal medications. Brazil and Malaysia for example, armed themselves with strict legislation regarding the sample collection and exports of flora fromCopy 1 213Y. SharifuddinChapter 6the rainforests. India on the other hand had embarked on an expensively ambitious project,jchristened the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library with the objective of compiling a 30- million-page electronic encyclopaedia of ancient Indian medical systems of ayurveda, unani and siddha which date back thousands of years. This initiative is perfectly understandable in ensuring such knowledge remained in public hands rather than corporate patents, as the Indian government has been embroiled in many high-profile patent litigation cases challenging individuals and companies alike in the US and European Patent Offices.\\\\\\| Part 1 of the first chapter also detailing the importance of safety assessment of phytomedicines and phytochemicals for the benefit of both the general public and the industry. Introduction to the compound of interest, andrographolide and previous studies on the potential toxicity and genotoxicity of this phytochemical was also discussed.As elaborated previously, the increased consumption of traditional herbal products by the general public in conjunction with the perception that such products are entirely safe due to its 'natural' status and the paucity of reliable scientific data on their safety as well as their efficacy, should be immediately addressed. The author also believes that such opinions and attitudes by the public towards herbal products consumption would continue as the trend of leading a natural and 'green' lifestyle is currently in vogue. Data are lacking on various aspects of herbal medicines including subtle detrimental effects such as mutations, their impact on biotransformation as well as possible drug-herb interactions.Computer-assisted structure activity relationship programmes based on expert knowledge, namely DEREK and METEOR were employed to provide semi-qualitative predictions on the toxicity and possible metabolites of andrographolide. The in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMA) was used to investigate the potential of andrographolide to induce micronuclei, a reliable genotoxic biomarker in metabolically competent cell lines, i The assay was also combined with kinetochore labelling using CREST antibodies toI elucidate the mechanisms responsible in micronuclei induction (see Chapter 3).Cytotoxicity of andrographolide was also examined using microscopical identification of necrotic and apoptotic cells as well as trypan-blue exclusion assay. After andrographolide was found to act primarily in an aneugenic manner as opposed to being a clastogen, assessment of the compound's capacity to disrupt mitotic machinery and causing chromosome aberrations were assessed (see Chapter 4). In relation to disruption to mitoticCopy 1 214Y. SharifuddinChapter 6apparatus, mitotic outcome and cellular recovery after andrographolide exposure were also looked into. The data obtained on these studies assisted in providing better comprehension | of andrographolide's possible mode of action. It is generally accepted that aneugenic compounds possess a threshold of genotoxicity (COM, 2002), thus the underlying mode of action would also show a threshold of activity. HPRT forward mutation assay was chosen because it was suitably robust for qualitative and quantitative determination of genotoxic potential (see Chapter 5).|[i| In Silico Screening of Toxicity and Prediction of Andrographolide BiotransformationThe existence of high number of phytochemicals with wide structural diversity and the paucity of data on their various properties are some of the factors that is slowing down the research & development including safety assessment procedures. Computer-assisted structure activity relationship (CSAR) assessment allows semi-qualitative assessment and priority setting for testing strategies on high number of compounds before embarking on laboratory-based experiments. Two expert-knowledge-based programmes namely DEREK and METEOR were used to predict in silico the toxicity and biotransformation of andrographolide respectively. The results obtained using DEREK showed that andrographolide is capable of causing nephropathy in rodents as well as skin sensitisation and chromosome damage in mammals in vitro, where the latter is attributed to the presence a-alkylidene y-butyrolactone moiety detected as a, p-unsaturated ester or thioester by DEREK. Indeed, this particular part of the chemical structure among others was supported by experimental data to be responsible for the phytochemical's cytotoxic activity in vitro (Nanduri et al, 2004). It is worth pointing out that DEREK regarded the cytotoxic and | genotoxic potential of andrographolide to be plausible in vitro because the programme is examining the chemical structure of andrographolide whereas in vivo, the compound would | be subjected to biotransformation where the metabolites can either be more reactive or vice-versa. Thus METEOR was utilised to providing possible Phase I and II biotransformation routes of andrographolide. The various possible metabolites anticipated by METEOR exhibited similar outcome compared to those obtained experimentally. Previous studies involving rodents and small sample of human volunteers showed a variety of metabolites and all of these were anticipated by METEOR. However, the programme was not capable of determining whether these possible metabolites are more or less reactiveCopy 1 215Y. SharifuddinChapter 6than the parent compound. As discussed previously, CSAR programmes are useful in certain aspects but they can only complement but not overrule experimental findings.DEREK, METEOR or any other expert-knowledge-based programme can also be useful in priority setting for testing strategies, for example the European Union adopted a legislative|| proposal for a new chemical management system known as REACH that for one aspect, requires thousands of chemicals in cosmetics to be tested against skin irritation and yet the EU also warrants that testing of chemicals for cosmetic products in animals to end by 2009.6.2 Elucidating the Genotoxic Potential of Andrographolide In VitroThe results obtained using the CSAR programmes provided a sketch on andrographolide's toxicity portrait. The in vitro cytokinesis-block mironucleus assay (CBMA) in combination with anti-kinetochore labelling using CREST antibodies was used to paint a better picture of the portrait and it was revealed that andrographolide induced statistically significant micronuclei frequency at the lower concentrations tested, primarily in an aneugenic manner in V-79, AHH-1 and MCL-5 cell lines. There was significant difference in the frequency of micronuclei induction between the three cell lines tested and this may be attributed to the difference in metabolic capacity. Although V-79 cells are not metabolically competent, attributing the higher micronuclei frequency observed mainly due to biotransformation deficit might not be flawless. Ideally, data comparison between andrographolide-treated V- 79 cells supplemented with S9-liver extract and those that are not might provide a better picture on the effect metabolic enzymes upon andrographolide genotoxicity potential.1| However, the presence of external metabolic capacity such as S9 poses disadvantages of its own since the low levels of certain P450 cytochromes and high levels of others, does not j necessarily represent normal animal or human biotransformation process (Tweats et al 2007). Nonetheless, these data provided valuable insights into andrographolide biotransformation in human cell lines that also augment the in silico predictions derived from DEREK and METEOR. The V-79 cell line is deficient in p53 activity whereas AHH- 1 and MCL-5 cells are capable of undergoing normal DNA repair process and judging by available data on the frequency of micronuclei induction, the cells' p53 status were considered to be not of significant influence in cellular response towards andrographolide. Rajagopal et al. (2003) reported that the p53 status of cancer cells exposed toY. SharifuddinChapter 6andrographolide did not account for the anti-proliferative properties exerted by the compound.Andrographolide was also found to cause cell death in a dose-dependent fashion mainly via | necrosis rather than apoptosis. Different methods were employed to assess the cytotoxicityof the phytochemical of interest and the trend observed was similar. Cellular toxicity exerted by andrographolide was demonstrated to be dependent on dose and incubation time. When MCL-5 cells were treated with andrographolide for 8 hours, the frequency of apoptotic cells was most prominent at 30 and 50pM but was still not as high as cells that suffered necrosis. Prolonging the treatment period from 8 to 24 hours caused even more cells to undergo necrotic cell death whereas neither increment nor reduction was recorded for apoptotic cells and the value still lingered less than 2% of the cell population scored.Cell death induced by andrographolide was recently suggested to be independent of cellular caspase activities (Li et al., 2007). As discussed previously, andrographolide's influence on apoptosis is still not clear. There were reports of anti-apoptotic properties (Burgos et al.,2004; Chen et al., 2004) as well as pro-apoptotic effects in cells (Cheung et al., 2005; Kim & Milner, 2005) treated with andrographolide. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of these effects remained largely unexplored and it is still to be determined whether andrographolide impose its anti\/pro-apoptotic effects via direct or indirect action on cellular target(s).The concentrations of andrographolide at 30 and 50pM administered to cells that elicited relatively high apoptotic response also educed comparatively high micronuclei incidence, suggesting a possible link between these doses, micronucleation and apoptotic responses. Decordier et al., (2005) proposed that increased caspase-3 activity has a direct role in | micronuclei formation. Indeed, caspase-3 activity, which is a distinguishing factor in| apoptosis execution, was observed to be up-regulated in the presence of andrographolidei(Li et al., 2007). It may be possible that this phytochemical only exert micronucleation at these concentrations after the cellular defense mechanisms has been overwhelmed or sufficient cellular target(s) has been damaged leading limited apoptotic reaction since cells die mainly via necrosis. Damage to cytoskeleton and other mitotic machinery may also initiate apoptosis (Decordier et al., 2002).Copy 1 217Y. SharifuddinChapter 6The phytochemical was demonstrated to inhibit cell growth and elicit cell death primarily via necrosis as the dose increased. Apoptosis was found to be a minor form of cell demise. Andrographolide exerts it cellular toxicity in time- and dose-dependent manner, where necrotic response was witnessed to be increased between 8 and 24 hours, in contrast to apoptosis which remained fairly stagnant during the same period. It seemed andrographolide has higher propensity to incite necrosis than the programmed cell death. Necrosis results from damage to a number of cellular constituents, including the plasma membrane. Several mechanisms alone or in combination can trigger and promote necrosis.These include plasma membrane permeability changes, which lead to a collapse of ion homeostasis, followed by cell and organelle swelling, and culminating in rupture of the cell membrane. For a given xenobiotic, the exact mechanisms leading to necrosis are not always known because the sequence of events is complex and many of these molecular events are causally interrelated with other mechanisms. Cause and effect cannot always be dissected from each other. Whether andrographolide inhibit apoptosis thus forcing damaged cells to die via necrosis, or various cellular targets were damaged by the compound and lead to necrosis, or a combination of both, is still not entirely clear.Although the genotoxicity portrait of this main phytochemical from Andrographis paniculata is clearer than before, it is still lacking refined colours. Since andrographolide act primarily in an aneugenic manner when inducing micronuclei, it may not directly acting on the DNA itself but exert its genotoxic influence indirectly by targeting various other cellular targets including but not limited to the mitotic machinery. The study on Chinese hamster lung fibroblast V-79 cells showed that andrographolide caused the numerical amplification of the microtubule organising centres (MTOCs) with corresponding aberration in chromosome segregation, which supported the data on micronuclei induction observed in V-79 cells as well as those in AHH-1 and MCL-5. This concentration- dependent effect also caused accruement of cells experiencing mitotic arrest. As the cells challenged with andrographolide harbours abnormal polarity during mitosis, it was deemed an interesting venture to see if such anomaly would give rise to cells with more than one nuclei. MCL-5 and V-79 cells were exposed to andrographolide for one and two cell cycles, subsequently cell fate and cell death frequency were determined microscopically.The presence of multiple MTOCs promoted aberrant mitoses. MCL-5 cells were also exposed to andrographolide for a longer period of 5 cell cycles in order to compare the mitotic outcome and cytotoxicity levels with cells challenged with the phytochemical in aCopy 1 218Y. SharifuddinChapter 6shorter treatment period. The data showed that longer treatment period elicit mitotic aberration, cell death and reduction in cell number. As andrographolide was shown to induce damage in aneugenic manner and aneugens are known to involve threshold of damage, the possibility of cells to recover after andrographolide exposure was also examined and the data revealed that the effect generally persisted.IiThe visual determination of MTOCs number is not hard and most studies rely on antibody- labelling followed by fluorescent microscopy. Although currently this is the preferred method, data has to be interpreted cautiously. Factors to be taken into account include antibody quality, the orientation of the centrosome relative to viewing and the fact that not every particle staining with anti-PCM antibodies necessarily represents a complete centrosome.The author believes that andrographolide may exerts it influence on mammalian cells as a parent compound and metabolism of the aglycone may reduced its genotoxicity, as shown by the observed differences in micronuclei induction between the cell lines adopted in these studies and various past publications cited in this thesis point to the same conclusion. However, it is inappropriate to speculate further until genotoxic experiments involving the possible metabolites of the compound can be performed and it is also remain to be seen if extensive metabolism (Phase I and II) would have an impact on the cytotoxicity of the compound without diminishing its reported medical properties.Andrographolide was shown to cause reduced sperm count, giant multinucleated cells formation and necrotic cell death in male rats (Akbarsha & Murugaian, 2000) and the author decided to elucidate the compounds possible mechanism of action(s) as part of the genotoxicity assessment.

Kumar et al., 2004) and it was hoped that by understanding the mode of action(s)and the effect on cell division kinetics would pave the way to the discovery of a possible pharmacological lead if not a potential anti-mitotic compound on its own or in combination with existing treatment.The measurements of replication and mitotic indexes after exposure to andrographolide for one cell cycle may underestimate the compound's cytotoxicity since these endpoints onlyY. SharifuddinChapter 6take into account the percentage of cell population that proliferated and attempting to progress through mitosis. The proportion of dead and dying cells were excluded. These short-term cytotoxicity parameters and the trypan-blue exclusion assay were reported to underestimate cytotoxicity (Fellowes & Donovan, 2007). Andrographolide was demonstrated to cause necrotic cell death in a dose- and exposure time-dependent manneri| rather than a prominent apoptotic response. At the top dose, andrographolide caused more than 50% cytotoxicity in the cell lines as indicated by RI, MI and trypan-blue measurements and significant reduction in cell number. Continuous exposure of MCL-5! cells to andrographolide for five cell cycles also showed that the compound maintain itsIcytotoxicity. Even though the in vitro micronucleus assay was not exclusively design for cell death measurement, the estimation of necrotic\/apoptotic cell population after andrographolide exposure provided a valuable mechanistic information.The incidence of condensed chromatin, considered to be an indication of cell death was determined in V-79 cells exposed to andrographolide. The data revealed a dose-dependent pattern of dead cell population even after the treated cells were allowed to recover for one cell cycle in the absence of andrographolide and the percentage of dead cells was similar to those treated continuously (see Table 4.6). The incidence of aberrant centrosome number measured directly after exposure and the incremental increases in mitotic index even after the removal of andrographolide indicated that it profoundly affected the cell cycle mechanism, which in the long term may affect cell division and cell number.Furthermore, cell viability determined using the plating efficiency as discussed in Chapter 5, demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in growing AHH-1 cell colonies after 14-days of initial inoculation with the same cell concentration. Thus, based on the available data, andrographolide affected cell cycle kinetics via disruption to normal chromosome segregation and increased the mitotic index while a proportion of cell population exposed to the compound died primarily via necrosis in a dose-dependent manner. Disruption to normal cell division and chromosome damage as well as the cytotoxicity of the compound effectively reduced cell number. Furthermore, depending on the dose of exposure, the treated mammalian cells' ability to segregate normally might have been impeded evident from the persistence of cell cycle delay even in the absence of the phytochemical. The author believes that andrographolide may have a higher cytotoxicity than those measured using the previously stated parameters and even though the Relative Total GrowthCopy 1 220Y. SharifuddinChapter 6calculation was not determined, it can be proposed that based on the observation and plating efficiency figures that this phytochemical will inhibit normal cell proliferation.The results obtained would be more meaningful if the concentration of andrographolide presence in human serum is known or to what extent human exposure in vivo would be. At the moment, reliable data on this aspect is lacking. As stated earlier, many published works on this phytochemical tend to concentrate on the possible medical and therapeutic benefits of andrographolide, often overlooking the possible risks it might pose and the current lack of evidence in toxicity particularly genotoxicity may place the health of the public in jeopardy unless more information is obtained. History may not exactly repeat itself but it does tend to rhyme. Previous examples of herbal products that were not tested for its genotoxic potential such as Aristolochia fangchi, Piper methysticum and Teuchrium chamaedrys, to name a few, has been costly to public health and confidence.6.3 Further StudiesBased on the findings made in this thesis, various further studies can be carried out but not limited to those described below. * Since the methods employed to elucidate cell fate after aberrant mitosis due to centrosome amplification after andrographolide exposure is not very specific, time- lapsed video-microscopy on cell should be used to obtain a clearer picture. * Another round of in silico assessment using both DEREK and METEOR can be performed on the predicted metabolites of andrographolide, which will provide valuable additional insights. * In relation to the previous point and the results obtained, experiments to characterise the possible metabolites of andrographolide from AHH-1, MCL-5 and V-79 cell cultures can be performed for example by using mass spectrometry.Copy 1 221Y. SharifuddinChapter 6* Test the metabolites of this phytochemical to determine whether they can pose as agenotoxic threats and studies should also be performed on normal diploid humancells and cells with competent p53 activity. * Conducting microarray studies on gene expression for cells exposed toandrographolide to determine its impact on genes involved in cell death mainlyapoptosis, centrosome duplication and the mitotic checkpoint genes. Such studies would shed more lights on how andrographolide is affecting centrosome multiplication and cell death. * Experiments to further examine and quantitate the effects of andrographolide on mammalian cells using apoptosis specific assays such as the TUNEL and caspases- oriented technique can be performed. Several cell types should be employed to provide a better picture since andrographolide is known to exert cell-specific response. * Performing the in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay on larger samples with the aim of finding the threshold level of exposure since andrographolide behaves in an aneugenic manner. * Sequencing the HPRT \"mutants to obtain more information of the type of damage.6.4 ConclusionMajor conclusions that can be drawn from these studies are:* In silico assessment utilising expert knowledge-based program harnessing quantitative structure activity relationship such as DEREK and METEOR was useful in providing general initial information about andrographolide, where paucity of data exist. DEREK predicted that andrographolide is capable of causing skin sensitisation and chromosome damage in mammals in vitro. Whereas, METEOR predicted plausible Phase I and Phase II biotransformation routes of andrographolide that were in agreement with past published works.Copy 1 222Y. SharifuddinChapter 6* Andrographolide induced micronuclei formation in vitro in all three cell lines tested, primarily at the lower doses of the compound. Difference in cellular metabolic capabilities may explain the difference in the level of micronuclei incidence. * Andrographolide induced kinetochore positive micronuclei, hence may act in aneugenic manner. * The doses between 30 and 50pM induced high micronuclei frequency compared to other concentration tested and these doses also caused relatively high apoptotic response in scored cells. * Cytotoxicity measurement performed using replicative index calculation, microscopical identification and trypan-blue exclusion assay showed a similar trend in that andrographolide cytotoxicity is both time- and dose-dependent. Cell death was observed to be primarily via necrosis as opposed to programmed cell death. Micronuclei frequency was observed to generally increase in tandem with cytotoxicity, except at the top two concentrations of 70 and 90pM. This phytochemical also reduced cell growth as the concentration increased. However, the compound's cytotoxicity might have been underestimated. * Andrographolide instigated centrosome amplifications as the treatment dose increased and the presence of multiple MTOCs affected chromosomal segregation fidelity with corresponding increases in the mitotic index. * V-79 cells challenged with andrographolide for 24 hours and subsequently allowed to grow for a further 24 and 48 hours post-treatment still retained abnormal MTOCs number. * Centrosome numerical aberrations in V-79 cells challenged with andrographolide lead to anomalous mitoses where cells failed to undergo cytokinesis due to abnormal centrosome number, producing bi-, tri-, tetra- and multinucleated cells.Copy I 223Y. SharifuddinChapter 6Even in the absence of the phytochemical after the initial insult, there was still significant presence of abnormal mitoses. * Andrographolide elicited HPRT ~ mutants formation between 5 to 50pM and the induction is dose-related with 30pM induced the highest mutagenic response. Cell viability measured as plating efficiency showed that andrographolide affected cell growth and supported cytotoxicity assessment conducted earlier.All the studies completed in this thesis were conducted with the aim of adding value to the existing knowledge on andrographolide by determining its potential genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and shed more lights into its possible mode of action. There are various windows of opportunity in terms of necessary further work that can be pursued in the future, some of which have been outlined by the author earlier as there are still more questions need to be answered. Recently, self-organising map (SOM) analysis performed on andrographolide suggested that this phytochemical may possess novel mechanism(s) of action (Jada et al., 2007). Therefore the author would like to end his thesis as the novelist and lepidopterist, Vladimir Nabokov once put it, \"The greater one's science, the deeper the sense of mystery\".Copy 1 224BIBLIOGRAPHY AND APPENDIXCl Y.

Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra PhD February 2016 i Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Abstract Herbal medicines (HMs) have been used to supplement, maintain, and treat health conditions, and have inspired the development of many Western pharmaceuticals. Migrant South Asian (SA) communities in the UK have brought with them their own traditional forms of medicine, yet little is known about their current use of HMs in the UK. Consuming HMs alongside conventional Western medicines could affect pharmacological treatment and lead to herb-drug interactions; hence, healthcare professionals (HCPs) should be aware of their patients' use of HMs. The import of HMs to the UK raises concerns over the quality, safety and regulation of HMs. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) barcoding can be used to discriminate between different species, and identify contaminants and adulterants, thus can be used for the authentication of HMs. The South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) questionnaire explored the knowledge and use of HMs by diasporic SA communities in the UK. It uncovered a vast range of HMs which were used by participants, where ingredients were sourced from, the concurrent use of herbal and Western medicines, and how minor ailments were treated. An online survey designed to investigate UK based practitioners' views of HMs revealed that HCPs claimed to lack sufficient knowledge of HMs. HCPs said they needed more training on HMs to help them make better informed decisions. Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) was identified as a culturally and commercially valuable plant, which was used for molecular analysis. A variety of tulsi samples were collected for authentication: community samples from SA families in the UK, commercial samples, and referenced specimens. Both ITS and trnH-psbA regions were successfully used to distinguish between several Ocimum species, and identify a potential species substitution. This research represents the first time that DNA based methods have been used to authenticate medicinal plants species used by migrant SA communities living in the UK. The results of this multi-disciplinary study provide a unique contribution to the evolving discipline of ethnopharmacology. ii Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Acknowledgements Firstly, I would like to thank my parents (Hardev Singh and Kulwant Kaur) for their unconditional love and support throughout this journey; especially my mum from whom I have inherited this knowledge and passion for herbal remedies. I am sincerely grateful to all my friends and family who accompanied me along the way. Without my supervisors this would not have been possible. I am thankful to them for giving me this opportunity to explore concepts I was passionate about and helping me to develop a range of skills I would not have otherwise acquired. I would like to thank Professor Adrian Slater for guiding me along each stage of the journey and his endless support. Professor Mark Johnson for his optimistic outlook and for telling me how I was to construct my thesis the same way an Indian ate an elephant \"a bit by bit\"; with this in mind I was able to complete this thesis. Professor Michael Heinrich who always gave encouraging advice and his enthusiasm for research was inspiring. I am so grateful to him for including me in his research group where I was able to meet some wonderful people. Dr Caroline Howard for keeping me calm and composed during testing times and her meticulous feedback throughout the process. Their advice and support throughout this journey has been invaluable. The Biomolecular Technology Group at De Montfort University and 'Michael Heinrichs' Research Group' at the London School of Pharmacy introduced me to some unforgettable people who I shared an office and lab with. The coffee breaks, lunches and conferences would not have been the same without you. I was very fortunate to meet such amazing people. I appreciate the efforts of my friends and colleagues at Lloyds Pharmacy, who juggled my requests to ensure I was able to attend important events for my PhD. Their support and encouragement was highly valuable. I would also like to thank Dr Alan Paton (The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew) for helping identify some Ocimum samples collected during the research period. Dr Eike Reich (Director at CAMAG Laboratory, Switzerland), Professor Peter Nick (Botanical Institute Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany), and Sebastian Pole (Pukka Herbs) for their contribution of Ocimum samples which were used for molecular analysis. My PhD would not have been possible without the love, support, compassion, and guidance of all these people to whom I am eternally grateful to. iii Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Profile of Presentations Presentations Bi-annual presentations to Michael Heinrichs' Research Group - Update on PhD Project.

Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 1.4.1 The Origins of Traditional Herbal Medicines Human beings have evolved alongside plants, which have been used as food and medicine for millennia (Chevallier, 2007). People learnt by trial and error which plants, seeds, berries and fruits were good to eat; as a consequence they became aware of the potential health benefits. Hatfield (2007) suggests the precise origins of HMs are unclear, but it is likely to have occurred as a by-product of the use of plants in other ways; for example, chewing the leaves of a particular plant may have caused the mouth to feel anaesthetised, leading to the plant being used for toothache, or a plant rubbed on the skin to wipe a wound may have helped it heal establishing its use in wound healing. The knowledge of which plants are medicinally beneficial comes from their use as food and traditional cultural backgrounds (Chevallier, 2007). Folk practice of medicine, using plants to treat and prevent diseases, began as an oral tradition and has been passed down generations, long before written records were created (Hatfield, 2007). Around the world there are many different cultures which have created their own system of traditional medicine to diagnose, prevent and treat illnesses (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011). Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medical system, is believed to be more than five-thousand years old, and is said to be one of the oldest medical systems known; it is a holistic approach to managing health and preventing disease (Williamson, 2002; Sharma et al., 2007). Ancient Chinese traditions dating back to the Stone Age claim that man gradually learnt to recognise the properties of plants, and then used them as medicine (Hong, 2004). Egyptian papyrus scripts as early as 3000 BC found preserved, contained hundreds of hieroglyphics detailing specific medical conditions and herbal treatments (Ehrlich, 2011). Pedanius Dioscordes the famous Greek physician published the first European herbal pharmacopoeia, around 65 AD, called De Materia Medica. Dioscordes organised all the plants in a systematic manner, grouping plants with similar pharmacological actions together (Isely, 1994). More recently Saslis-Lagoudakis et al. (2011) demonstrated the applications of phylogeny in mapping the pharmacological properties of ethnomedicinal plants and bioscreening. Their phylogenetic study comparing cross cultural uses of ethnomedicinal plants uncovered that similar traditional uses were found in different areas where the related species were available. Throughout history and across the globe plants have been used as the primary source of medicine (Hatfield, 2007). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO, 2003), \"Traditional medicine refers to health practices, approaches, knowledge and beliefs incorporating plant, animal and mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techniques and exercises, applied singularly or in combination to treat, diagnose and prevent illnesses or maintain well-4 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra being\". WHO (2008) clarifies that the terms complementary\/ alternative\/ non-conventional medicines are used interchangeably when referring to traditional medicines, and the terms allopathic\/ conventional are used to refer to Western medicines. Herbal medicines form an integral part of Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM), which is a broad term used to describe hundreds of therapies including: massage, nourishment, exercise, and HMs (Kayne, 2002). For the purpose of this study the terms herbal medicine(s), traditional herbal medicine(s), herbal remedy\/remedies, and traditional herbal remedy\/remedies will be used interchangeably. 1.4.2 Herbal Medicines as Drug Leads Approximately 25% of drugs prescribed worldwide are derived from plants (Sahoo et al., 2010); for example, aspirin based on the chemicals found in willow bark (Salix spp.) is used for pain relief and anti-platelet effects, and digoxin from the foxglove plant (Digitalis lanata Ehrh.) is used for cardiac disease (Hartmann, 2007; Li and Vederas, 2009). Metformin, an oral anti-diabetic drug, often the first line treatment for type 2 diabetics is also derived from plants. It originates from French lilac or Goat's rue (Galega officinalis L.) a plant used in traditional medicine for centuries, with the first references documented in 1500 BC by Egyptian physicians (Witters, 2001). The use of papaverine from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) as a vasodilator led to the development of verapamil for hypertension. More commonly known are the opioid analgesics codeine and morphine for pain relief which are also derivatives of the opium poppy (Cragg and Newman, 2013). In 1820 French pharmacists Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Caventou isolated and purified quinine from the bark of the cinchona tree (Cinchona officinalis L.) which was used to treat malaria. The traditional use of quinine for treating fever and infectious disease dates back to the 1600s (Achan et al., 2011). Since then quinine has formed the basis of the development of other anti-malarial drugs such as cholorquine and mefloquine. More than 60% of cancer drugs on the market or being researched are based on natural products (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011); including the vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine isolated from the Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus L.) (Cragg and Newman, 2013). Over the past hundred years developments in technology have revolutionised health care across most parts of the world, where once HMs were the only source of medication (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011). Plants have the ability to synthesise a variety of chemical compounds which can be consumed by humans for maintaining health, treatment and prevention of disease. Advances in chemistry have made it possible to extract, isolate, and 5 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra synthesise compounds from natural products. This has been a contributory factor to the decline in use of plants for primary care and a rise in the use of synthetic drugs (Sahoo et al., 2010; Dias et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the search for potential therapeutic agents continues, with nearly half of the small molecules approved in this decade having originated from natural products (Kong et al., 2009; Pandikumar et al., 2011). As the process of drug discovery is becoming more expensive, reverting back to traditional remedies may provide a cheaper alternative for pharmaceutical companies (Patwardhan and Khambholja, 2011). Patwardhan and Mashelkar (2009) claim that as natural products have been used for a long time, there is more information available on tolerance and safety compared with the development of novel synthetic drugs which have never been used before. However, most of this traditional knowledge is still not documented or supported by clinical trials. Patwardhan and Mashelkar (2009) propose a \"reverse pharmacology approach\" whereby products traditionally known to have clinical effects are scientifically tested; they go on to say, \"The novelty of this approach is the combination of living traditional knowledge such as Ayurveda and the application of modern technology and processes to provide better and safer leads.\" Natural resources which have been traditionally used by indigenous people have been commercially exploited by corporations; this is known as biopiracy (Robinson, 2010). Several high profile cases of biopiracy including basmati, neem and turmeric have led to the development of guidelines to protect indigenous knowledge and resources (Robinson, 2010). In 1995 two scientists in America got a patent for the use of turmeric in wound healing. The patent was revoked in 1997 after a complaint was filed by India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, who highlighted that turmeric had traditionally been used in wound healing for thousands of years (Nobel, 2014). Since then a database (Traditional Knowledge Digital Library) to document traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and ancient formulations has been developed by the Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) to protect traditional knowledge from being exploited by biopiracy (Gupta, 2011). Patenting laws to protect indigenous species have been introduced in several countries including China, India, Peru and the Philippines (Robinson, 2010). Scientists are continuously exploring the benefits natural products offer in anticipation of discovering new drug leads and developing novel drugs. Ayyanar and Ignacimuthu (2011) suggest further ethnopharmacological studies are required for discovering potential new drugs. 6 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 1.4.3 The Use of Herbal Medicines Hatfield (2007) declares that the use of medicinal plants is part of our heritage, but fears this valuable knowledge is on the brink of extinction. Despite this, it is estimated that in some developing countries more than 80% of the population depend on HMs for primary health care (WHO, 2008). Up to 90% of the population in Africa and 70% in India depend on traditional medicine to meet their healthcare needs (WHO, 2005). This could be due to poverty, a lack of access to or knowledge of modern medicine (Ayyanar and Ignacimuthu, 2011). In India the HMs market is immense; 960 medicinal plants have been widely incorporated into the HMs industry, of which 178 have been identified as high volume due to popularity and demand (Sahoo et al., 2010). However, the use of HMs is not limited to developing countries; over the past few decades interest in HMs in developed countries has been rising (Ernst and White, 2000; Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). In Europe, Germany and France are leading in over-the-counter (OTC) sales of HMs, which are readily available even in conventional pharmacies (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011). The WHO (2003) factsheet on traditional medicines claims that in Germany 90% of the population have used a natural remedy at some time in their life. The HMs market value is steadily growing; the annual expenditure on CAM in Australia, Canada and the UK, was estimated to be worth US$ 80 million, US$ 2400 million, and US$ 2300 million respectively (WHO, 2002a). In the United States of America (USA) the use of CAM has been steadily increasing since the 1950s (Kessler et al., 2001); in 2011 the annual retail sales value of HMs in the USA was estimated to be over US$5.2 billion (Blumenthal, 2012). According to market research conducted by Mintel (2009), complementary therapies including Ayurvedic medicines, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and homeopathic remedies are becoming more popular in the UK. The report titled 'Complementary medicines- UK, December 2009,' (Mintel, 2009) identified that the number of people trying complementary medicines was increasing, with over twelve-million people reported to have used them in the UK in a single year. In 2009 the UK's complementary medicines market was worth PS213 million, and a 20% growth was predicted for the next two years (Mintel, 2009). A survey to explore the publics' perceptions of HMs in the UK in 2008 was commissioned by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The results uncovered that 35% of the population surveyed claimed to have used HMs (Ipsos MORI, 2008). In 2013 a review of ten surveys based on UK patients and HMs consumers indicated that on average 37% of the population used HMs (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2014). The UK HMs market is relatively strong, especially with a diverse ethnic population that is interested in non-Western alternatives (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2014). Wachtel-Galor and Benzie (2011) suggest some of the reasons people use HMs include: cost (i.e. 7 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra more affordable than conventional therapies), part of traditional background, HMs perceived to have less adverse effects than chemical alternatives, to replace or supplement CWM, and the notion of natural medicines being safer. 1.4.4 Potential Problems with Herbal Medicines Destruction of Natural Resources There may be important implications for the sustainability of natural resources; as the increasing demand for HMs could lead to overharvesting of endangered species and destruction of natural resources (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011; Booker et al., 2012). Alam and Belt (2009) claim, \"Medicinal plant species are depleting at a rapid pace due to large-scale, unsustainable collection from their natural habitats.\" According to one estimate over four thousand economically important species are threatened with extinction due to commercial over-harvesting to meet manufacturers demands (Schippmann et al., 2002). There are approximately 29,000 plant species protected by the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) (Hollingsworth et al., 2011); for instance, American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is native to the USA and can only be legally harvested in nineteen states with special restrictions controlling the growth, harvesting, sales, and export (US Fish and Wildlife Services International Affairs, 2015). In Europe there are several plant species which are listed as European Protected Species (EPS) under the European Habitats Directive, including shore dock (Rumex rupestris Le Gall), traditionally used as an astringent, and marsh saxifrage (Saxifraga hirculus L.) (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2014). The conservation of medicinal plants is of paramount importance as they remain an important source for natural ingredients for HMs, and there are potentially many more active compounds yet to be screened (Alam and Belt, 2009). Standardisation of Herbal Medicines Due to natural variance in the chemical composition of plants it can be difficult to standardise HMs (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011). Factors such as the climate, soil, genotype, parts of the plants used, time the plants are harvested, storage, drying, and manufacturing process can all affect the chemical composition of medicinal plants (Shaw et al., 2012); making it difficult to ensure the reproducibility of HMs (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). Manufacturers of HMs are required to standardise and quantify the active constituents 8 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra in formulations according to Pharmacopoeia standards (Waimer and Schwabe, 2011); however, if the raw plant material is consumed or unregulated formulations are used it is difficult to ascertain the chemical composition of the herbal remedy. HMs used in the UK come from all over the world, from a range of traditional medical systems including TCM and Ayurveda; therefore, problems with nomenclature and standardisation of names can occur (Shaw et al., 2012). In the USA and Europe the Latin binomials names are used as the official way of referring to plants; however, traditional names may be different and could lead to confusion when selecting the plant species. For example, in the Philippines ginseng was popular for its use as a male aphrodisiac but this \"ginseng\" was not the same as the ginseng which belongs to the genus Panax; instead it was Jatropha podagrica Hook. commonly known as the Buddha belly plant (Begg and Gaskin, 1994; Bareja, 2010). It remains unclear how the Buddha belly plant was used instead of ginseng; it may have occurred as the plants looked similar, or due to the commercial value of ginseng whereby the Buddha belly plant was a cheaper alternative. When the traditional and binomials names of species are different it increases the risk of species substitution and adulteration, which may be accidental or deliberate. The Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, has created a database called the 'Medicinal Plants Names Service' which is a resource for searching information about medicinal plant names. As different names may be used for the same plant (i.e. in different countries, communities, and languages) and even the Latin binomials themselves change; this database has collated all the relevant published information about medicinal plant names enabling more accurate communication and identification of medicinal plants (Medicinal Plants Names Service, 2015). Species Substitution and Adulteration Reports of commercially valuable species being substituted for cheaper alternatives have been documented (Vassou et al., 2015). Ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A.Mey) has numerous health benefits; it has been used for fatigue, enhancement of mental and physical performance, and as a male stimulant (Chevailler, 2007). The rising demand for ginseng has led to an increased commercial value and a decline in natural resources. Dharmananda (2002) identified several cheaper and more abundant species which were used as substitutes for ginseng in TCM including: Codonopsis pilosula Nannf. (also known as dang shen or poor mans' ginseng) which is unrelated to ginseng but believed to have a similar action, Rumex madaio Makino and Talinum paniculatum (Jacq.) Gaertn. which look similar to ginseng roots. 9 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra A Chinese slimming aid in which Stephania tetrandra S.Moore had been substituted by Aristolochia fangchi Y.C.Wu ex L.D.Chow & S.M.Hwang caused renal damage in over one hundred patients in Belgium (Vanherweghem, 1998). Stephania tetrandra is traditionally referred to as 'Fangchi' or 'Fangji', while Aristolochia fangchi is referred to as 'Mu Fangchi' or 'Mu Fangji'; the similar traditional names may explain how the confusion of the species occurred (Sim et al., 2013). The chemical composition of the two species is very different; aristolochic acids found in Aristolochia species have been known to be nephrotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. The use of Aristolochia species has since been restricted and prohibited in several countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK (Vanherweghem, 1998; Michl et al., 2014)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T10:45:23.078009Z","inner_id":15,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16,"annotations":[{"id":16,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":764,"end":779,"text":"Sida

World Health Organisation (WHO) has emphasised the need to control the quality of HMs by using modern control techniques and standards (WHO, 1998). The application of molecular techniques in identifying substitute and adulterant species in HMs has been widely investigated; hence, DNA-based techniques have been used to accurately recognise plant species in HMs (Howard, 2010). Vassou et al. (2015) highlight the problems of species substitution and adulteration in their study of Indian country mallow also known as 'Bala' in Ayurveda (Sida cordifolia L.). They bought 25 market samples of raw material from thirteen states in India. They used DNA barcoding techniques to identify the species of the samples collected, and found that none of the samples were Sida cordifolia; instead, 76% were identified as other Sida species and the remaining 24% were from other genera. Several of the samples were identified as Sida acuta Burm.f. which has six times more ephedrine in comparison to Sida cordifolia; this may be associated with adverse effects. The research by Vassou et al. (2015) signifies the importance of species authentication of HMs and the applications of DNA barcoding for this purpose. Contamination of Herbal Medicines Substitution of ingredients or species, and contamination with toxic substances may be a particular concern especially when HMs are not regulated (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). On several occasions Ayurvedic formulations have been found to contain heavy metals such as iron, mercury, and arsenic which can release toxic compounds in the body altering normal metabolic pathways, and can cause systemic toxicity (Ernst, 1998; Egbuna and Bose, 2005). Saper et al. (2008) found nearly two hundred Ayurvedic preparations bought over the internet had detectable levels of heavy metals which were not stated on the label. A British poison information centre, in the West Midlands, identified five cases of heavy metal contamination within seven years; the products contained lead, zinc, mercury, arsenic, 10 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra aluminium, and tin. The individuals who had consumed the contaminated HMs had concentrations of heavy metals 2-10 times the upper limit of normal physiological values, resulting in harmful effects and morbidities (Bayly et al., 1995). Contamination with undeclared prescription medicines, mefenamic acid and diazepam, was identified in some Chinese HMs; they caused severe adverse effects including gastrointestinal bleeding and renal failure (Gertner et al., 1994). HMs contaminated with microbes due to poor manufacturing, harvesting, and storage conditions have also been documented (Zhang et al., 2012). This identifies that stringent controls need to be reinforced over the manufacture, sales and supply of high quality and safe HMs. Interactions between Herbal and Conventional Medicines Herbal medicines have been used long before written records were created; despite this there is still limited clinical evidence to support the safety and efficacy of most HMs (Ernst, 1998). The incidence of herb-drug interactions are still not fully known, and there is no reliable body of information to assess the potential problems (Wachtel-Galor and Benzie, 2011; Williamson et al., 2013). An interaction is believed to occur when the effects of a drug are changed by the presence of another substance (Baxter, 2008). The effects of the drug may be mimicked or opposed by the herbal medicine; which in turn may alter the efficacy of the drug. For example, St John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is known to be an enzyme inducer, affecting the Cytochrome P450 enzymes; it has been associated with reducing levels of ciclosporin leading to transplant rejection as the efficacy of the drug was reduced (Graham et al., 2008; Williamson et al., 2013). There is an increased risk of toxicity if a drug's metabolism and clearance is inhibited, especially for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range such as digoxin, lithium, or theophylline (Colalto, 2010). Due to the lack of controlled research it is difficult to ascertain the prevalence of herb-drug interactions. This has been explored further in Chapter 3, section 3.4.4.1 (p91). Adverse Effects of Herbal Medicines There may be many side-effects associated with HMs which are not acknowledged; Ravindran et al. (2009) believe, ''traditional medicines are generally free of the deleterious side effects.'' In contrary Balaji (2010) expresses concerns of toxicity in using raw plant material \/ extracts by stating, ''laboratory findings suggest that turmeric extracts can be 11 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra toxic to the liver when taken in high doses, or for a prolonged period of time.'' There are several well-known Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) caused by the consumption of HMs including: burning sensation and skin irritation caused by chillies (Capsicum spp.) or Aloe vera L., allergic reactions to celery or nuts, blood disorders associated with garlic, and aristolochic acid induced nephrotoxicity (Chevallier, 2007; Michl et al., 2014). The Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) collates information on ADRs from over one hundred countries and in 2010 it found 12, 679 reports of ADRs linked to HMs (UMC, 2011). Adverse effects linked to HMs reported included: anaphylaxis, anxiety, dermatitis, chest pain, toxicity and death; due to heavy metal and microbial contamination, pesticide residues, and also the wrong species of plant used in preparation of the medicine (Sahoo et al., 2010). In the UK, the MHRA established the 'Yellow Card Scheme' (YCS) to monitor the safety of healthcare products including HMs; it was designed to enable HCPs and the public to report side-effects and ADRs caused by drugs and HMs (MHRA, 2014a). The reporting of herbal ADRs remains low, just 51 reports of herbal ADRs were received by the MHRA in 2014 (MHRA, 2014b; MHRA, 2014c). 1.4.5 Regulation of Herbal Medicines In response to some of the quality issues identified with HMs, the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) was established by the Department of Indian Systems of Medicines and Homoeopathy (ISM&H) in 2003 to regulate HMs in India. AYUSH proposed to regulate Ayurvedic formulations made in India that are often distributed worldwide, by focusing on research, quality control, and education relating to HMs. The Indian government declared that traditional herbal remedies needed scientific validation to promote national and international use of HMs which have been used for centuries (Sharma, 2000). The responsibility for ensuring the safety and standards of Ayurvedic preparations lies with AYUSH. The labelling requirements are clearly stated in AYUSH guidelines (Section III, Annex A). The scope of the AYUSH regulation covers, \"the product requirements, good manufacturing practices, requirements for competence of personnel and testing of AYUSH products included in the active pharmaceutical ingredient,\" (AYUSH, n.d.). An investigation by Saper et al. (2008) found nearly two hundred Ayurvedic preparations bought over the internet had detectable levels of heavy metals, which were not stated on the label. This highlights that products failing to comply with the guidelines are still readily available. There are concerns about the quality and safety of HMs bought online as it is difficult to regulate what is being sold via the internet (The Pharmaceutical Journal, 2002). 12 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra In Europe, the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive (THMPD) was passed in 2004 by the European Parliament and Council of Europe to set out guidelines to regulate the use of HMs (Directive 2004\/24\/EC). Previously HMs could be marketed without an official Marketing Authorisation (MA), as long as the unlicensed products were of high quality and safe for consumption, as decided by each country on a national level. The 2004\/24\/EC directive led to the development of Traditional Herbal Medicine Registration Scheme (THMRS) in the UK, which meant over-the-counter HMs which made a medicinal claim, would require a Traditional Herbal Medicine Registration (THR) or a MA, by May 2011. The legislation required herbal medicinal products to have at least 30 years of evidence of their traditional use in the EU; or 15 years within the EU and 15 years elsewhere for products from other countries (European Parliament, 2004). In addition, it required safety data to be provided and the manufacturer was obliged to guarantee the quality of the product with regards to Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) and European Pharmacopoeia standards. Manufacturers were also expected to ensure pharmacovigilance procedures were in place to monitor ADRs (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). The idea was to regulate high quality and safe HMs, in addition to giving consumers the confidence in the products they were using. As of the 30th April 2011 no unlicensed herbal medicinal product could be sold in the EU unless they held a product license. Products on the market before this date were given a three year period to sell through, until 30th April 2014. The Directive 2004\/24\/EC defines herbal medicinal products as, \"Any medicinal product, exclusively containing as active ingredients one or more herbal substances or one or more herbal preparations, or one or more such herbal substances in combination with one or more such herbal preparations.\" It also defines: - Herbal substances as, \"All mainly whole, fragmented or cut plants, plant parts, algae, fungi, lichen in an unprocessed, usually dried, form, but sometimes fresh. Certain exudates that have not been subjected to a specific treatment are also considered to be herbal substances. Herbal substances are precisely defined by the plant part used and the botanical name according to the binomial system (genus, species, variety and author),\" - Herbal preparations as, \"Preparations obtained by subjecting herbal substances to treatments such as extraction, distillation, expression, fractionation, purification, concentration or fermentation. These include comminuted or powdered herbal substances, tinctures, extracts, essential oils, expressed juices and processed exudates.\" 13 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 1.5 Overview of the Research Project The initial purpose of this research was to explore the use of HMs amongst diasporic SA communities in the UK, followed by the identification of plant species in HMs using molecular techniques (Appendix 1). As DNA-based identification techniques are a relatively new way of authenticating plant species, the research team was interested in studying this phenomenon further; with the prospect of developing a specific, fast, and reliable identification tool for a selected plant species. The first phase of this study was called the South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) Project (Chapter 2); whereby, the primary aim of investigating the current use of HMs by SA communities in the UK was explored. During the development of the SATMED project a questionnaire was designed to explore whether participants were using HMs, what they were using, where ingredients were sourced from, and where their knowledge of HMs originated. One of the key themes involved exploring whether or not participants shared the information about their use of HMs with their Western HCPs. After exploring a 'patients' perspective of HMs the researcher was intrigued to understand what HCPs thought of HMs. As there is very limited research which has looked at UK HCPs knowledge and views of HMs, it was anticipated that the results would provide an original contribution to the gap in the existing literature. An online survey to explore HCPs personal and professional experiences with HMs was created and distributed using social media (Chapter 3). From the results of the SATMED questionnaire a medicinal plant or herbal remedy which could be used for molecular analysis was identified. Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) was selected as the medicinal plant for a case study of the application of DNA analysis for confirmation of genetic identity, as tulsi was identified as a culturally and commercially valuable plant during the research period (Chapter 4). The cultural, religious and medicinal uses of tulsi were investigated during interviews with participants. Tulsi samples from participants, commercial sources, and authenticated specimen were collected for DNA analysis. This phase of the research was called the 'Tulsi Project'. All three aspects of the research overlap as the concepts are a continuation from each other (Figure 1-1). The Venn diagram in Figure 1-1 represents some of the key ideas explored within each section and some of the common themes which emerged through this research. Ethical approval from the De Montfort University Ethics Committee for each phase of the research was obtained separately (Appendix 1 & 2); further details can be found in each chapter (Chapter 2, 3, and 4). 14 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra A detailed introduction in each chapter explains the aims, objectives, and rationale for the section. As the methodology was tailored to each phase it is detailed within the specific chapter; followed by a detailed analysis of the results and a discussion. The final discussion chapter (Chapter 5) summarises the key findings of this research and illustrates how the three strands of this investigation integrate and support each other; furthermore, it highlights the implications of this research and further work which could be conducted. Figure 1-1 Venn Diagram to Illustrate the Integration of the Three Phases of the Research The Venn diagram shows how the SATMED Project, HCPs survey and the Tulsi Project interlink to explore the aims and objectives of this study. 15 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.0 South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) Project 2.1 Introduction The migration of South Asians (SAs) to the United Kingdom (UK) has created an ethnically diverse population; with SAs forming 5.3% of the total UK population as uncovered by the 2011 Census (Office for National Statistics, 2012). With the migration of people to the UK they have brought with them their own herbal remedies which they may still be using; however, there is little documented evidence to support the current use of herbal medicines (HMs) by SAs in the UK (Etkin and Elisabetsky, 2005; Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Pieroni and Torry, 2007). This raises several interesting questions such as where the knowledge originates from, how it is transmitted through generations, where ingredients for traditional remedies are obtained from, and if HMs are used in conjunction with conventional Western medicines (CWM) are Western healthcare professionals (HCPs) aware. The South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) project was designed to be an exploratory survey to establish the current use of HMs by South Asian (SA) communities in the UK. This chapter will summarise the aim and objectives of this research, followed by some background information to support the need to conduct this investigation. The methodology will describe the research methods used for the SATMED project and the results section will give a detailed analysis of the findings of this study. The terms herbal remedies, traditional herbal medicines (THM), and herbal medicines (HMs) will be used interchangeably throughout this research. 2.2 Aim of the SATMED Project The aim of the SATMED project is to explore the origins, use, and transmission of knowledge of traditional herbal medicines used amongst South Asian diasporic communities in the UK. 2.3 Objectives of the SATMED Project 1. Explore the knowledge and use of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian diasporic communities; describe where the knowledge originates from and how it is transmitted. 2. Investigate where ingredients for herbal medicines are sourced from. 16 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3. Obtain insight into the relationship between South Asian people who use herbal medicines and their healthcare professionals. 4. Summarise the types of herbal medicines and plants used within South Asian communities; to establish which plant species would be suitable candidates for DNA authentication. 2.4 Background Research In order to establish why focusing on SA populations for this research is important, the background of how migration to the UK first started will be considered. Then the types of HMs and traditional medical systems used by SAs will be established to determine the origins of HMs, and evidence to support the use of HMs will be explored. 2.4.1 South Asians in the UK The Formation of South Asia The first British men went to India as traders as part of the East Indian Company (EIC) in search of spices, silk, cotton, ivory and tea. The Indian subcontinent was rich in natural resources which Europeans wanted (Kaul, 2011). The EIC began to rule areas of India and developed its own armies. After almost a century of oppressive control in India by the EIC the Indians rebelled and the British Government rule was established in 1858 (Lambert, 2014). The two hundred years of British rule in India came to an end in 1947 after which India, which was once bigger than Europe, was partitioned into independent states. The main body was left as India while the eastern and western wings were called Pakistan (Figure 2-1). In 1971 East Pakistan was renamed as Bangladesh. After this the three states and Sri Lanka collectively formed South Asia, and its people were referred to as South Asians (Healy and Aslam, 1989; Clarke et al., 1990; Brown, 2006). Figure 2-1 Map of India Pre and Post Partitioning (adapted from Brown, 2006) 17 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Migration of South Asians to the UK Migration from South Asia started early in the 19th century when SAs first moved to countries such as Mauritius, British Guiana, and Trinidad (Clarke et al., 1990). By the late 20th century SAs had become widely spread across Europe, Africa, Asia, America, and the Middle East (Brown, 2006). Reasons for migration may have been forced (e.g. contracts of indenture or refugees), or free willed - the migration of traders, entrepreneurs, labourers, and professionals. Service in the British army took men from India across the world and as transport links improved, migration became easier so people emigrated to seek new opportunities. During the partitioning of India in 1947 there was large-scale immigration to the UK from India and Pakistan due to the violence and unrest.

immigrants clustered in inner city areas of London, Manchester and the West Midlands, working in factories, with little or no education and qualifications (Hanif and Karamat, 2009). The influx continued until restrictions were set by the Commonwealth Immigrants Act of 1962 (Healy and Aslam, 1989). During the British reign in India between 1858 and 1947 many Indians were educated or trained and taken to other countries to work in British colonies. Indians were used to work in clerical, manual labour and farming roles. Thirty two thousand Indians were taken to Southeast Africa under indentured labour contracts to build the Uganda railway networks (Kasozi et al., 1994). When East African Governments created polices to prevent British passport holders from working, many Asians who had settled there were left unemployed (Healy and Aslam, 1989). On the 4th August 1972 the president of Uganda, Idi Amin, declared that all Asians would be expelled from Uganda within ninety days. At the time of expulsion there were seventy five thousand Asians living in Uganda. Many held British passports so were able to immigrate to the UK (Kasozi et al., 1994). These immigrants were mostly of Gujarati origin and they settled around Leicester and London; they were better educated and many had successful businesses (Hanif and Karamat, 2009). According to Healy and Aslam (1989) the main types of Asians found in the UK can be categorised as Punjabi, Gujarati, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and those East African Asians usually of Punjabi or Gujarati origin from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and to a lesser extent Malawi or Zambia. The SA population in the UK can be described as being heterogeneous due to the variety of religions, cultures, languages, social and economic backgrounds (Gill and Lloyd, 2009; Hanif and Karamat, 2009). 18 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Diaspora comes from the Greek word (diaspora) which means to disperse, scatter or spread. Brown (2006) uses the word diaspora to refer to groups of people with a common ethnicity who have left their original homeland but retained a cultural kinship. Although South Asia includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, when referring to SA diasporic communities in this study it will focus on Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities as agreed by most official and research bodies (Khunti et al., 2009; Office for National Statistics, 2012). UK Census Statistics The 1991 Census was the first to account for ethnic minorities in the UK (Ballard, 2004). The SA ethnic minority encompassed Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. Of the total population 5.5% was identified as ethnic minority of which half was of SA origin (Brown, 2006). The total SA population in the UK has continued to rise from 3.9% in 2001 to 5.3% in 2011; Figure 2-2 illustrates the changes in SA ethnic groups in the UK between 2001 and 2011 (Office for National Statistics, 2012). The Census data reveals that SAs live in all areas of the UK, clustering in certain areas reflecting migration patterns (Figure 2-3). For example, there is a high concentration of Indians and Bangladeshis residing in Greater London as well as the East and West Midlands; while, Pakistanis can be found predominantly in West Yorkshire, Manchester and the Midlands (Gill and Lloyd, 2009; Hanif and Karamat, 2009). 0.00.51.01.52.02.53.0Indian Pakistani BangladeshiPopulation %South Asian Population In the UK20012011Figure 2-2 South Asian Ethnic Groups in the UK 2001 - 2011 (adapted from Office for National Statistics, 2012) 19 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.4.2 South Asian Traditional Medicine South Asian countries have a heritage of traditional herbal medicine; Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani are systems of traditional medicine (TM) native to SAs. Ayurveda is one of India's most well-known systems of TM which has hundreds of formulations; it was first documented in the Rig Veda around 1500 BC. Siddha is said to be the oldest system of medicine known, dating back over ten thousand years; it is another branch of traditional Indian medicine originating from South India. A newer concept was introduced around 1025 AD, by the Muslim herbalist Ibn Sina (more commonly known in the West as Avicenna), who took his inspiration from Greek and Islamic medicines to create Unani (Lone et al., 2012; Ansari and Satish, 2013). Ayurveda Ayurveda translates as 'the knowledge of life' and is the holistic approach to traditional Indian herbal medicine; encompassing the use of HMs, breathing techniques, meditation, yoga and exercise as a complete system of managing health and preventing disease (Williamson, 2002). Ayurveda is believed to have originated from the Hindu God, Lord Brahma, known as the creator of the universe (Nerkar, 2007). It is thought to be one of the oldest systems of TM, which was developed more than five-thousand years ago; when the wise men known as 'rishis', were thought to have retreated to the Himalayas to meditate to gain divine knowledge from Lord Brahma, about how to tackle diseases (Nerkar, 2007). Figure 2-3 Distribution of Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi Communities in the UK (adapted from Office for National Statistics, Census 2011) Indian Pakistani Bangladeshi 20 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Their enlightenment was transcribed into Vedas which are Hindu scriptures, still referred to today. There are four Vedas in Hinduism; Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samveda and Atharvaveda which contain herbal remedies and cures for diseases. The principles of Ayurveda originate from the first of the four scriptures known as the Rigveda. The Rigveda describes how the universe is made from five elements known as the Pancha Mehabhutas; space (Aksha), air (Vayu), fire (Teja), water (Aap) and earth (Prithi). In different combinations these elements make three forces: vata, pitta and kapha, which compose the human body and are known as the tridosha (Patwardhan et al., 2005). Williamson (2002) recognised that modern science has been able to interpret the three components of the tridosha as different systems within the body. Vata is equivalent to the central nervous system which regulates breathing, heart rate, and movement. Pitta represents the endocrine system and is involved in thermogenesis, digestion, and energy production. While the kapha corresponds to the immune system, providing protection to the body and wound healing. Disease occurs when components of the tridosha become imbalanced. For instance altered metabolism due to pitta imbalance links to thyroid gland malfunction (Godagama, 2001; Williamson, 2002; Patwardhan et al., 2005). Ayurveda focuses on maintaining good health and making the body more resistant to illness and disease; equal importance is also given to the treatment of disease (Vishnuprasad et al., 2013). Ayurvedic practice takes into consideration individual differences and the treatment is tailored (Godagama, 2001). Ayurvedic medicinal plants have already provided the Western world with several active molecules for treating an array of conditions including: curcumins for inflammation, and guggulsterone for hyperlipidaemia (Patwardhan, 2000). Approximately six hundred plants are described in the Ayurvedic Matria Medica (Dash and Kashyap, 1980). Ayurvedic medicinal plants are attached to five key aspects; identification (ensuring the correct species is used is of paramount importance), cultivation, harvest, storage and usage; these factors can ultimately affect the activity, effect, and potency of the remedy (Godagama, 2001). The distinctive details outlining the selection and use of plants in Ayurveda ensures the correct plants are selected for the appropriate use; an innate system for controlling production of herbal remedies. Within Ayurveda, plants are formulated into polyherbal mixtures known as 'rasayana'. A common Ayurvedic mixture is Chyawanprash, believed to replenish the bodies' nutrients, containing a combination of over forty natural herbs including: amla (Indian gooseberry), cinnamon, clove, turmeric, asparagus and beetroot; according to Dabur Research Foundation (1991), the market leader of Chyawanprash sales, this blend of herbs which has been used for over two and a half thousand years, has antioxidant properties and helps strengthen the 21 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra immune system. Triphala is another common rasayana, consisting of three fruits: amla (Phyllanthus emblica L. Indian gooseberry), beleric (Terminalia bellirica (Gaertn.) Roxb bastard myrobalan), and harad (Terminalia chebula Retx. black myrobalan). This formulation has been used to treat numerous ailments including digestive problems, constipation, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (Ponnusankar et al., 2011). In the sixteenth century during the colonization of India by the British, the traditional form of medicine was deemed backward and inferior and was gradually succeeded by Western medicine (Dash and Kashyap, 1980). Modern Western medicine was not accessible to all, it was expensive and difficult for those in rural areas to access; hence, in remote villages Ayurvedic traditions continued to thrive. Traditional doctors preserved the practices of prescribing and dispensing HMs. In 1980 the National Congress of India decided Ayurveda should be regulated just like Western medicine so institutes for training Ayurvedic practitioners were introduced (Godagama, 2001). In the late 1980's Ayurvedic remedies were being used in Western countries. In India, Ayurveda remains as the system for primary health care, and interest across the world is growing (Sharm et al., 2007; Lallanila, 2015). Yumi et al. (2008) suggest the reason why Ayurveda is becoming more popular in Western communities is due to the increased rates of immigration of Asians from India. This is supported by Sandhu and Heinrich (2005) who also found that immigrants brought their traditional forms of herbal medicine with them. Siddha Siddha is another branch of traditional Indian medicine which is believed to have originated more than ten thousand years ago. The Siddha scriptures are written in Tamil; hence, are predominantly used by people of Tamil origin (Krishnamurthy and Mouli, 1984). One of the distinctions made between Ayurveda and Siddha is that, Ayurveda is generally used more by people from the north of India and Kerala, while Siddha remains prevalent amongst those further South in Tamil Nadu (Zysk, 2008). Siddha healers still play an important role in rural health care (Pandikumar et al., 2011). Legend has it that Siddha was created by the Hindu God, Lord Shiva, who passed the knowledge of medicine to the saints known as Siddhars. There were eighteen Siddhars - men who had achieved supernatural abilities, which enabled them to heal the sick, through their spirituality and meditation. These saints were believed to be able to cure any illness by utilising their divine knowledge to produce medicines from plants. Siddha takes into account 22 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra the individuals' disease; considering the persons symptoms, age, gender and environmental factors to produce a holistic treatment. The tongue, eyes, pulse, and urine are all assessed to determine the type of imbalance and to formulate the appropriate treatment (AYUSH, 2012). There are several similarities between Ayurveda and Siddha. For example, the five elements which create the body: earth, water, fire, air and space which must be balanced. The concept of the three humours (Tamil: tiritocam, Sanskrit: tridosha) representing the wind (vata), bile (pitta) and phlegm (kapha) are also the same (Godagama, 2001; Zysk, 2008). The majority of the plants are used for similar conditions; some of the common examples include ginger for digestive complaints, tulsi for skin conditions, and garlic as an antibacterial (Chellappandian et al., 2012). The key differences recognised are that Siddha relies heavily on astrology to decide the appropriate treatment regime. The formulation process of medicines is deemed highly significant for example: the part of the plant used, the direction the sun penetrates the plant and the harvesting are all carefully regulated by the Siddha practitioners; deviations are believed to distort the effectiveness of treatment (Kumar et al., 2013). Ultimately both Ayurveda and Siddha provide a holistic system of healthcare; providing a path for life, promoting resilience to disease, and treatment for illness. Siddha remains the primary health care regime for the majority of South Indians in Tamil Nadu; and is also practiced in Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia (Chellappandian et al., 2012). Although modern medicine may be available across India, these systems of TM continue to thrive. Historical, cultural, and ecological factors could all contribute to the continued use of TM not only in India, but around the world (Kunwar et al., 2010; Pandikumar et al., 2011). Unani Unani is a newer form of TM, in contrast to Ayurveda and Siddha. Adopted by the Arabs, from the teachings of the ancient Greek and Roman philosopher-physicians Hippocrates and Galen. Having emerged over two thousand years ago (Lone et al., 2012), it incorporates traditional herbal remedies from several countries, including: India, China, Egypt, Persia, and many other Middle Eastern countries (AYUSH, 2012). The system was introduced to India by the Arabs, and used predominately by Muslims who lived there (Zysk, 2008). During the British rule, as with all the other forms of TM, Unani was deemed inferior and the availability of Western medicines surpassed the Unani system of healthcare. According to Unani principles, disease occurs as a natural process. The system is based on Hippocrates' Humoral Theory; this suggests there are four humours in the body - phlegm 23 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra (balgham), blood (dam), yellow bile (safra) and black bile (sauda). Every individual has their own unique humoral constitution; therefore, treatment has to be formulated specifically once the correct diagnosis is made. Pulse (nubz) measurement is the most common method for diagnosis, as well as examination of urine and stools (AYUSH, 2012). Unani recognises that social, economic, political, and environmental factors can affect an individual's health; reinforcing the importance of health promotion through adequate education, lifestyle and behavioural modifications (Husain et al., 2010; Lone et al., 2012). Unani offers a variety of ways of treating disease; regimental therapy, one of the most popular methods of treatment, includes: massage, exercise, diuretics and emesis, to rid the body of impurities. Diet therapy involves controlling food intake, food should be clean and fresh to prevent disease onset. Pharmacotherapy entails the use of naturally occurring medicines, and surgery - physically correcting abnormalities (AYUSH, 2012; Lone et al., 2012). One of the most common products used in Unani is black cumin (Nigella sativa L. English: small fennel, black seed, Sanskrit: kala jeera, Arabic: Habbatul barak). Seeds from the plant which is native to the Middle East and Southwest Asia are believed to be the remedy for all ailments (Tariq, 2008; Ansari and Satish, 2013). As defined by Islamic beliefs, it is said the Prophet Mohammed described the healing powers of black seed, as being able to cure any disease but death (Ansari and Satish, 2013). It is used for numerous health problems including: headache, cough, asthma, pain, rheumatism, diabetes, and many other conditions (Gali-Muhtasib et al., 2006; Tariq, 2008). The anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and analgesic effects are being widely investigated by researchers (Al-Ghamdi, 2001). Thymoquinone is one of the active compounds known to have several health benefits, including analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects (Gali-Muhtasib et al., 2006; Hosseinzadeh et al., 2007). Pharmacological and toxicological investigations have shown that some of the active compounds extracted have hepatoprotective and nephroprotective effects (Ali and Blunden, 2003). The seeds can be eaten whole, the oil extracts can be applied to the skin or mixed with other ingredients to formulate a herbal concoction. The versatility, availability, and religious significance attached to this aromatic seed means it is often consumed daily, especially by the Muslim population (Ansari and Satish, 2013). Like the other forms of traditional medicine discussed, Unani medicines have been used for centuries without real scientific validation. More research into the HMs recommended by Unani is required to investigate the safety and efficacy of this traditional medical system. 24 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.4.3 Evidence To Support the Use of Traditional Herbal Medicines Traditional plant based remedies may be preferred to synthetic alternatives as they have been considered to be relatively safer, with better therapeutic effects, less side effects, more affordable, and easily obtainable (Ayyanar and Ignacimuthu, 2011). Hatfield (2007) states, \"Man's use of plants may be viewed as a long standing clinical trial; remedies that have stood the test of time are likely to be worth further investigation.\" Although there may not be much scientific evidence to prove the efficacy of HMs, some researchers claim the fact that they have been used for so long can be used to validate their use (Pandikumar et al., 2011). Despite the long standing use of HMs, a shift towards evidence based medicine, and scientific validation is prompting more research into HMs. Two commonly used examples which have now been researched extensively are turmeric and garlic."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T11:11:22.550705Z","inner_id":17,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18,"annotations":[{"id":18,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":10,"end":26,"text":"Curcuma

(Curcuma longa L., Indian name: haldi) is commonly known as a spice, colorant and food preservative, which has several proposed medicinal benefits. It is said to have antioxidant, anticancer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects (Colalto, 2010). Curcumin, identified as the yellow pigment in turmeric, is a compound found in the rhizome of the plant; which is a therapeutically active component in turmeric responsible for its versatile medicinal properties (Sikora et al., 2010). Chemotherapeutic agents inhibit the hyperproliferation of cells, which develop into cancer. Synthetic drugs are often expensive, difficult to synthesise and have multiple side effects. On the other hand, curcumin extracted from turmeric is cheap, widely available, and is believed to kill tumour cells as it interferes with several cell signalling pathways that cause cell death by apoptosis and necrosis (Ravindran, et al., 2009; Sikora et al., 2010). Garlic (Allium sativum L., Indian name: lasan) is another popular ingredient used in many herbal formulations; which is believed to have antibacterial, anti-platelet, and anti-hypertensive effects. The therapeutically active components recognised in garlic are allicin and alliin (Colalto, 2010; Garodia, 2006). A review by Tovar and Petzel (2009) analysed the efficacy of garlic for treating dyslipidaemia, and its action in reducing high cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis; 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase. Garlic is effective at reducing low density lipids and triglycerides which contribute to high cholesterol; accordingly the benefits of reduced cholesterol correlate to reduced risk of stroke and heart disease. The antibacterial action of garlic was also observed in the West by the renowned scientist Louis Pasteur in 1858, who noted that bacteria died when they were exposed to garlic; crushed garlic juice was also used during the Second World War in wounds to prevent infections (Taylor, 2007; Arora and Kaur, 1999; Williamson, 2002). The mode of action is believed to be due to the active molecules, allicin 25 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra and alliin which interfere with thiol groups on bacterial and fungal enzymes, affecting essential metabolism leading to cell death, thus eradicating the organism (Williamson, 2002). There are numerous HMs which are getting recognition for their pharmacological effects in the Western world. Dentists commonly recommend cloves (Eugenia caryophylatta Thunb., Indian name: long) to their patients for toothaches. The dried flower buds have powerful anaesthetic, analgesic, antiseptic, antimicrobial and anti-emetic effects (Chevallier, 2007). Eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) has been identified as the active substance responsible for many of the medicinal benefits of cloves. The culinary use of cloves is not only to add a spicy aromatic flavour, but traditionally it was added to prevent food spoilage and to aid digestion (Trajano et al., 2010). Another product which is being recognised for its cosmetic value is neem (Azadirachta indica A.Juss. ); commercial soaps, shampoos, face washes, creams and lotions are now readily available. The neem tree is native to South Asia, and can grow up to thirty five meters tall; all parts of the tree can be used including the seeds, leaves and bark. It has been described as a pharmacy in its own right due to the many health benefits associated with it (Chevallier, 2007), including: antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, antipruritic, anti-cancer and a blood purifying properties (Kumar et al., 2006; Boursier et al., 2011; Pandikumar et al., 2011). The Foundation for Revitalisation of Local Health Traditions (FRLHT) in Bangalore, India, has established various projects across India to document the use of traditional HMs. One of the key priorities is to build a bridge between the traditional use and knowledge of HMs and modern scientific advances. By engaging in clinical research the FRLHT aims to establish clinical theories to support traditional use of HMs. By working with local communities, farmers, traditional healers, schools and educational institutes they have tried to preserve cultural heritage, cultivate sustainable resources, and provide an evidence base for traditional Ayurvedic practices (FRLHT, 2015). 2.4.4 Ethnopharmacological Research in the UK Ethnopharmacology is \"the scientific study of ethnic groups and their use of drugs\" (Johnson and Sargent, 1996). Ethnopharmacological research involves a multi-disciplinary approach whereby botany, chemistry, pharmacognosy, pharmacology and other disciplines are considered to document traditional knowledge and use of medicinal plants (King, 1992; Patwardhan, 2005; Heinrich et al., 2006). The research methods used are diverse and tailored to the objectives of the investigation (Elisabetsky and Etkin, 2009). Plant material may be collected, identified and examined by botanists and other scientists while social science 26 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra inquires may be conducted to explore the medicinal ethnography (Elisabetsky and Etkin, 2009; Mukherjee et al., 2010). By combining methodologies from several disciplines such as social and natural science the objective of ethnopharmacological research which sets out to explore and understand traditional systems of medicine can be attained (Elisabetsky and Etkin, 2009). There is a vast amount of ethnopharmacological research which has explored the use of traditional HMs by people around the world (Chhetri, 1994; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Malla and Chhetri, 2009; Kunwar et al., 2010; Ayyanar and Ignacimuthu, 2011; Bhatia et al., 2014). Pieroni et al. (2010) claims that most ethnobotanical research is conducted in exotic places and that a gradual shift towards exploring what is going on in 'back yards and urban environments' will occur. They go on to say that ethnobotanists began to explore the use of plants by migrant populations in the late 1990s in North America; this was driven by an increasing interest in the use and perception of traditional HMs. In the UK, surveys to explore the use of HMs have been conducted (Ipsos MORI, 2008; Mintel, 2009); however, there is limited research into the use of HMs by SA communities in the UK (Bhopal, 1986a; Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Pieroni and Torry, 2007; Pieroni et al., 2010). Bhopal (1986a) conducted interviews with 65 Asian participants in Glasgow to explore the role of TM in an Asian community. He discovered that the knowledge of HMs amongst participants was high, but HMs only had a modest role in participants' healthcare. Participants did not feel it was necessary to disclose information about their use of HMs to their HCPs; so Bhopal explored HCPs views of HMs too. He offered general practitioners (n=33) and healthcare workers (n=10) the opportunity to complete a questionnaire about Asian patients' use of HMs. The results revealed that HCPs awareness of Asian HMs was 'extremely low' and HCPs were unaware of their patients' use of HMs. As the research was conducted on a small Asian community in Glasgow the results are not representative of SAs in the UK; in addition, as the research was conducted in 1986 the results are now dated. Sandhu and Heinrich (2005) explored the knowledge and use of HMs amongst a Sikh Punjabi community in London, by conducting semi-structured interviews with 84 participants. They documented the use of numerous HMs by the research participants and uncovered how participants managed minor ailments. As this research was focused on a specific religious (Sikh) and cultural group (Punjabi) the results are not representative of SAs; the authors do highlight that there is an urgent need to investigate the use of HMs amongst other ethnic groups in the UK. The study by Pieroni and Torry (2007) focused specifically on Kashmiri, Gujarati, and English participants medical perception of five 'herbal drugs' (cinnamon, cloves, garlic, 27 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra ginger, and mint). A questionnaire was completed by 274 participants who were asked to state the perceived medicinal properties and uses of the products listed. They found a difference in traditional knowledge amongst the ethnic groups; whereby, Kashmiri participants had widespread knowledge of the herbal drugs listed while it was less prevalent amongst Gujarati and especially English participants. Pieroni et al. (2010) conducted interviews (n=37) and focus groups (n=42) with Bengalis in Bradford to explore their use of traditional HMs. They recorded approximately 150 herbal preparations recalled by participants, and identified that many of them were still commonly used in the UK. Pieroni et al. (2010) found that middle-aged and older participants were more accurately able to recall HMs than younger participants; moreover, younger generations seemed to prefer CWM over traditional HMs. The results of this research indicate that HMs are still commonly used by Bangladeshi migrant communities in the UK. The current research on SA communities' use of HMs in the UK is limited; but, it has provided a basis for conducting this research. Some of the concepts explored by other researchers will be further investigated in this study, to help gain a better understanding about the current use of HMs by SAs in the UK. 28 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.5 Methodology 2.5.1 Questionnaire Design A questionnaire to meet the aims and objectives of the SATMED project was designed; to explore the current use of HMs amongst SA diasporic communities in the UK. Several draft copies of the questionnaire were piloted; Malhotra and Birks (2006) refer to pilot studies as, ''testing the questionnaire on a small sample of respondents for the purpose of improving the questionnaire by identifying and eliminating potential problems.'' Amendments made to the questionnaire included: reducing the length of the survey without compromising the quality of the data, removing a question which used images of HMs which was ambiguous, and rewording some questions (Appendix 1). After which a more refined and tailored questionnaire was produced to meet the objectives of the research (Appendix 3). A participant information leaflet (PIL) was provided to participants to inform them about the purpose of the research (Appendix 4). Initially the questionnaire was designed for participants to complete themselves; however, after conducting a pilot study the researcher believed it was more appropriate to administer the questionnaire personally. Several reasons for changing the way the questionnaire was conducted included: incomplete questionnaires, participants dropping out part-way, illegible handwriting, and feedback from participants who stated the survey was too long to write answers to despite having great knowledge of HMs. To ensure no bias was introduced from the researcher when asking the questions, thorough training from Professor Mark Johnson was attained; the training enabled the researcher to develop skills to keep participants engaged and affirmed how to ask the questions. Although this process was time consuming for the researcher the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. Advantages of the researcher administering the questionnaires included: the chance to build rapport with the participants - gaining trust and better responses to questions, a higher response rate, more complete questionnaires returned, and clarification of questions therefore less invalid responses (Dornyei and Taguchi 2010). Furthermore, as the researcher was fluent in Punjabi, Hindi and Urdu it was easier to engage participants who could not understand, read or write English. A mixture of open and closed (quantitative and qualitative) questions were used in this survey. One of the reasons for using quantitative questions was so the data obtained could be statistically analysed; enabling the quantification of data and comparisons to be made. While the qualitative questions obtained richer, more in-depth knowledge of the individual participants' perception regarding the objectives of the study (Levin et al., 2008). The questionnaire took on average ten to twenty minutes to complete. 29 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.5.2 The Target Research Population The participant inclusion criteria for this research stated participants must be over eighteen years of age (so they could consent for their own participation without the need for parental consent), and from a South Asian (SA) background (i.e. Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi) (Office for National Statistics, 2012). There is no existing database which permits randomised or systematic identification of a suitable population of SA origin (i.e. the sampling frame); therefore, an opportunity sampling technique was used. For this reason there was no pre-defined target of gender or age group to survey. Malhotra and Birks (2006) say opportunity sampling involves, ''being in the right place at the right time.'' The sampling method used followed established practice in other similar studies whereby the target research population was directly approached in anticipation of recruiting more participants (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Pieroni et al., 2010). Participants were reassured that all responses would remain anonymous (as no personal identifiable data was taken), and confidential. All the responses were kept in the possession of the primary researcher with no unauthorised access. A unique aspect of this study was that it focused on SA populations as a whole; whereas, most other studies focused on single ethnic or religious groups (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Jennings, 2014; Pieroni et al., 2010). 2.5.3 Ethical Approval De Montfort University (DMU) ethical approval was obtained before the questionnaires were distributed (Appendix 1). The questionnaire and PIL (Appendix 3 & 4) were reviewed by the DMU ethics committee, who gave feedback and some minor suggestions. Instead of using the phrase 'side-effects' they recommended using a more neutral statement such as 'unwanted' or 'unexpected' effects. The ethics committee also commented on the length of the survey, which after the first pilot study was shortened; as some questions were removed or merged together. 2.5.4 Questionnaire Distribution In total two hundred questionnaires were conducted across several locations in Birmingham and Leicester (one hundred in each city); two cities the primary researcher knew well (Table 2-1). The Census statistics suggested that Birmingham and Leicester would provide a reliable base for the field work as 7% of the population of England are now of SA origin; hence, the data would have wider applicability (Office for National Statistics, 2012). 30 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Statistics revealed that over 30% of the residents in Birmingham are from an ethnic minority group. The SA communities of interest in Birmingham have increased from 17.9% in 2001 to 22.5% in 2011 (Office for National Statistics, 2012).The demographic profile of Leicester, in 2007, revealed that approximately 40% of Leicester's population were from an ethnic minority background (Leicester City Council, 2007). The 2011 Census suggests that the minority population of Leicester has risen to 54.9%, 35.8% of SA background (Office for National Statistics, 2012).

SPSS has multiple advantages over other analytical software including: the range of statistical techniques which enable exploration of relationships between variables (e.g. T-tests and analysis of variance test). In addition, significant differences between variables can be tested and cross-tabulations can also be created (Pallant, 2007). The software enables data to be coded; thus, allowing both quantitative and qualitative responses to be analysed. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to create the graphical representations. The number (n) of participants or responses will be referenced throughout the results. 31 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.6 Results and Discussion This section will summarise the results of the SATMED questionnaire. The survey was split into four segments: the first section explored participants' demographics, the second looked at the use of traditional herbal remedies, the third at the use of prescription medication, and finally the treatment of minor ailments. Although, two hundred surveys were conducted across several locations in Birmingham and Leicester, eight were discarded as they were either incomplete or the participants did not come under the SA inclusion criteria, leaving a total of one hundred and ninety two surveys for analysis. 2.6.1 Sample Description This section was designed to determine participants' age, gender, ethnicity, religion, and occupation. In addition, participants were asked where they currently lived, were born, and where their parents were born to establish migration patterns and links between their knowledge of herbal medicines (HMs) and their heritage. A total of 192 questionnaires were used in this analysis. Gender and Age Profile of Participants The sample was comprised of 69% (n=132) female and 31% (n=60) male participants. As an opportunity sampling technique was employed, there was no method of screening or selecting the research sample to ensure an equal number of female and male participants were selected. One of the reasons for having more female respondents was due to the locations where the research was conducted; in the community and day centres visited in both Birmingham and Leicester it was observed that there was always a disproportionately larger number of females in comparison to males."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T11:27:48.408906Z","inner_id":18,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":19,"annotations":[{"id":19,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":11671,"end":11680,"text":"digestion","labels":["Medicinal

(1994) suggested the gender of the researcher may affect participants' willingness to take part in research, saying SA male participants may not be as responsive to a female researcher. As there were fewer opportunities to approach male participants it is difficult to say whether or not the gender of the researcher affected the recruitment process. There was a mixture of participants from the different age groups defined; as illustrated in Figure 2-4 which summarises the participants' age and gender profiles. A larger number of participants (n=59) were in the 61 years plus age range; this could be explained by the locations selected to target SA participants (i.e. day centres, community centres, and religious institutes) which were predominately used by older SA cohorts. In order to explore the younger generations' knowledge and use of traditional HMs places where younger SA 32 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra participants congregated were also identified; for example, the De Montfort University campus and library. There is much debate on how to classify age groups as young, middle aged, and elderly (WHO, 2010). For the purpose of this study those under 30 years will be referred to as young participants, middle age will include 31 to 60 year olds, and those over 61 years will be classed as older or elderly participants as identified by the Department of Health (2001). Participants' Ethnicity The 2011 Census results confirm the largest SA ethnic group in the UK are the Indians, followed by Pakistanis and a significantly smaller number of Bangladeshis (Office for National Statistics, 2012); this was also evident in this research sample (Figure 2-5). There were 73% Indian, 19% Pakistani, and 3% Bangladeshi participants. Questionnaires were distributed in areas where a variety of South Asians (SAs) could be found (e.g. SA community centres and the university campus). It should be noted that there was a large number of participants who would describe their ethnicity as Indian even though their families now reside in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In addition, several participants wanted to add the option of Asian British; however, it was explained to participants that their place of birth would be where they can express their nationality; but ethnicity was to determine their racial ancestry (Prabhat, 2010). Prabhat (2010) defines a person's ethnicity as being linked to their traditional and cultural heritage, language, rituals, behavioural and religious characteristics. 73%19%3%5%Participants' EthnicityIndianPakistaniBangladeshiOtherFigure 2-5 SATMED Participants' Ethnicity 0510152025303540455020 or under 21-30 years 31-40 years 41-50 years 51-60 years 61 years +Number of participantsAge rangeAge and Gender Profile of ParticipantsMaleFemaleFigure 2-4 SATMED Participants' Age and Gender 33 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Participants' Place of Birth Figure 2-6 represents the birth place of participants and their parents; it highlights that 44% (n=84) of participants were born in the UK, 27% (n=52) in India, 17% (n=33) in Africa (Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania), 10% (n=20) in Pakistan, and 2% (n=3) in other countries which included France, Germany, and Saudi Arabia. The majority of participants born in the UK were in the young age group (n=73); while those born in India (n=46), Africa (n=29), and Pakistan (n=15) were predominately in the middle age or older age group. More than half of the participants' parents (55%, n=107) were born in India; despite this many of these participants families are now settled in Pakistan and Bangladesh but they still call themselves Indian as their parents were born in India before the partitioning into independent states (Healy and Aslam, 1989; Brown, 2006). This information can be used to determine whether participants are first or second generation citizens in the UK. The term first generation could refer to citizens born in a country or those who were born in a foreign country and moved to take residence in another (Moffett, 2015). For the purpose of this analysis, first generation immigrants will be used to describe those participants born in a foreign country but now living in the UK. From the total sample population 108 participants can be identified as being first generation immigrants as they were born outside of the UK. Nine participants stated both parents were born in the UK, making these participants first generation citizens or natives to the country of birth. Second generation refers to people who are born in the country of relocation (i.e. the UK) with one or both parents born abroad (Moffett, 2015). There were 75 participants who were second generation citizens as they were born in the UK, but one or both parents were born elsewhere. Many of the participants' parents were born in South Asia and may be responsible for transmitting valuable knowledge of THM to future generations. 020406080100120UnitedKingdomIndia Africa Pakistan OtherNumber of participantsPlace of BirthParticipants and their Parents Birth Place ParticipantMotherFatherFigure 2-6 SATMED Participants' and Their Parents' Place of Birth 34 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Participants' First Language Spoken The primary language spoken by 50% (n=97) of participants was English (Figure 2-7). Followed by a quarter of participants who said their first language was Punjabi; this included people from India and Pakistan as prior to the partitioning of India, Punjabi was the main language spoken in the North. In the UK, Punjabi is the third most popular language spoken, followed by Urdu, Bengali, and then Gujarati (Office for National Statistics, 2012). In this study, Gujarati was the third most common primary language spoken and often these participants did not speak any other language. Other first languages spoken included Mirpuri and Tamil. Participants were also asked if they spoke other languages too. Many of those who spoke English as a first language also spoke Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, and Gujarati. Other languages participants were fluent in included: Swahili, French, German, and Dutch. Participants' Religion There were a fairly even number of participants from the three main SA religions: Hinduism (34%, n=64), Sikhism (26%, n=50), and Islam (36%, n=70) (Healy and Aslam, 1989). There was a small fraction of participants who said they were Christian and their parents were originally from South India; this is where Christianity is most common in India. The option of 'No Religion' was only selected by 2% (n=4) of participants (Figure 2-8). Some religions have a strong affiliation with herbal medicines (HMs); for example the Tulsi plant represents a goddess in Hinduism (Miller and Miller, 2003). By determining participants' religion the link between religion and transfer of knowledge of HMs can be explored. 50%25%15%4%3% 3%Participants' First LanguageEnglishPunjabiGujaratiUrduHindiOtherFigure 2-7 SATMED Participants' First Language 34%26%36%2% 2%Participants' ReligionHinduSikhMuslimChristianNo ReligionFigure 2-8 SATMED Participants' Religion 35 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Participants' Qualifications Figure 2-9 represents the highest levels of qualifications attained by participants organised according to the various age groups. The majority of participants who selected 'no qualification' were first generation immigrants (n=50) and in the 61 years plus age range (n=42). Many participants who had some qualifications from India or Pakistan were considered to be equivalent to UK GCSEs; hence, a number of participants (n=10) in the 51-60 and 61+ age group had GCSEs. A-levels were the highest qualification attained for the majority of participants in the 20 or under and 21-30 years age range (n=69); 93% (n=64) of participants doing A-levels were currently enrolled on an undergraduate degree programme (e.g. pharmacy, nursing, psychology, business information technology, or accounting). Apprenticeships were more common amongst the middle aged population (n=14). Hanif and Karamat (2009) highlighted that many of the first SA immigrants had little or no qualifications; this is also evident from the results of this survey. On the other hand, some first generation immigrants with degrees may have come to the UK in search of professional job opportunities. Most of the degrees obtained by SA participants were professional degrees. Masters and PhD qualifications were also attained by a small proportion of participants. Participants' Occupational Status Participants' occupations were summarised into the following categories: student, employed, unemployed, retired, or housewife. Students formed 38% (n=73) of the research population, followed by 27% (n=52) of participants who had retired. The employed population which comprised 24% (n=46) of participants worked in professional roles such as healthcare (doctors, pharmacists, nurses, and carers), finance (accounts) construction (surveyors), management (company directors and managers), and law (solicitors).

When middle aged SA women were asked about their occupation 11 participants (6%) said their job role was a \"housewife\". As this is not a paid occupation it was not included in the employed section instead it was given its own category. Summary of the Research Participants The research sample was composed of a diverse range of SA participants. There were more female than male participants from a variety of age groups, ethnic origins, religions, and cultural groups. Although the questionnaires were conducted around several locations in Birmingham and Leicester, participants living across the UK took part in this questionnaire (Figure 2-10); this was because the temples where the research was conducted had devotees from around the country coming to worship. In addition, the students at DMU were also from different parts of the UK. Participants from all over Birmingham, Coventry, Derby, Dudley, Leicester, Liverpool, London (i.e. Croydon, Hounslow, Ilford, Slough, Southall, Surrey, and Wembley), Loughborough, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Nottingham, Rotherham, Walsall, and Wolverhampton took part in this research (Figure 2-10). Due to the number of participants living across the UK it means the results can be generalised to SAs in the UK, rather than just SA communities in the two cities where the questionnaires were conducted.

Locations participants were from in the UK. 37 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 2.6.2 The Use of Traditional Herbal Remedies Question 1: Do you use any herbs, plants, or spices to make homemade herbal remedies for your health? If YES, what do you use and why? The words herbs, plants, and spices were used to prompt participants to think about the different types of HMs they used. Two thirds of participants (66%, n=126) said they did use HMs to supplement their health and to treat various conditions. There was a vast range of HMs participants listed, including: ajwain (carom seeds) for digestion, ginger for nausea and coughs, aloe vera for eczema, cardamom as a mouth freshener or to aid digestion, mint for indigestion, fennel for coughs and constipation, and cloves for toothache. The numerous uses of turmeric recorded by participants included its use in treating coughs and colds, wound healing, as an antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and its immune boosting properties. Honey and lemon was not only used for coughs and sore throats but also as a face mask to remove pimples and lighten the skin. Several products to control diabetes were identified such as curry leaf, fenugreek, karela, and tulsi. HMs to help reduce blood pressure (e.g. garlic) and cholesterol (e.g. cinnamon) were noted. Other conditions which participants claimed to treat with HMs included: healthy hair growth by using egg and yoghurt or henna, blocked sinuses opened with menthol or eucalyptus oil, and tea tree oil for spots and scars. Pieroni et al. (2010) highlight that very little is known about the use of homemade herbal medicines amongst migrant populations. The results of this question uncover that SA migrant communities in the UK commonly use a diverse range of HMs. The herbal products identified by participants have been summarised in Appendix 5. The 34% of participants (n=66) who said they did not use any herbal remedies were asked to move on to question 6 as the following questions were about participants' personal use of HMs. For the following questions 2-5, the results are only for the 126 people who said they did use herbal remedies in question 1. Question 2: Where do you get the ingredients for your herbal remedies from? This question was asked to explore how ingredients for HMs were sourced, and to determine whether or not ingredients for HMs could be bought in the UK. This question allowed for multiple responses as often people get their ingredients from a variety of different places. Figure 2-11 illustrates the different ways participants obtained the ingredients for their HMs. From the analysis of the results, 21 participants said they got the Family\/ FriendsGrow your ownAyurvedic clinicLocal supermarketAbroadOnlineOtherIngredients for Herbal Remedies Obtained FromFigure 2-11 Where Ingredients for Herbal Remedies Were Sourced 38 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra ingredients from their 'family\/friends'. Participants mentioned family members grew some products so shared them, or parents and grandparents gave HMs if ever unwell as reasons for getting products from family and friends. Tulsi, ajwain, aloe vera, curry plant, mint, and coriander were identified as plants commonly grown by participants (n=23). A small number of participants (n=4) revealed they visited Ayurvedic practitioners and clinics for HMs. Three of the participants who selected the 'other' option, disclosed that they got their HMs from 'Baba Ramdev' they did not class this as an Ayurvedic clinic\/ practitioner as there was a strong religious affiliation. Ramdev studied Sanskrit and yoga before he began teaching others; he became famous when his yoga sessions were aired on Indian television channels across the world. He established the Divya Yog Mandir which was supported by a pharmaceutical company (Divya Pharmacy), which formulated and sold Ramdev's HMs, all based on traditional Ayurvedic remedies (Divya Yog Mandir, 2015). These HMs are manufactured in India and sold around the world; evidently they are available in the UK with Ramdev centres open across the UK and several participants claimed to be using them. The remaining six participants who selected the 'other' option said they got their HMS from: the pharmacy (n=2), Holland and Barrett, The Body Shop, and Forever Aloe Vera representatives. Participants (n=27) also stated they got their ingredients from 'abroad' this included countries such as Africa, India, and Pakistan. Raw ingredients including ajwain, shilajeet, neem, tulsi, and turmeric; as well as commercial products such as chyawanprash, churan, and amrat dhara were commonly imported from India and Pakistan. Participant 67 said, ''when my family comes from Pakistan or Saudi Arabia they bring us some neem leaves,'' while participant 108 stated, ''I buy my herbs fresh in India, let them dry and grind them, then bring them back to the UK.'' Despite the widespread availability of turmeric in the UK, several respondents mentioned that their families back in India and Pakistan grew their own turmeric; which they believed was better quality and more effective as highlighted by participant 162, ''you can tell in the colour and taste of the turmeric it is much better from Pakistan.'' Pieroni et al. (2010) also found participants in their study imported ingredients for HMs from abroad if they were not available in the UK; but, mentioned that many ingredients were now available in Bangladeshi shops or larger supermarkets. The most common place to get ingredients for HMs, selected by 101 participants, was local supermarkets. To explore the availability of ingredients in the UK participants were asked to specify whether they got their products from Asian supermarkets, Western chain supermarkets (e.g. Asda, Tesco or other Western shops) or both. Figure 2-12 exemplifies that a similar number of participants said they got their ingredients from either Asian shops only (n=35) or both Asian and chain supermarkets (n=36). 39 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Just over half of respondents (51%, n=18) who specified 'Asian shops only' were over 61 years old. Specific Asian shops where the ingredients were bought from were mentioned for example in South Birmingham 'Metha' and in Leicester the 'Kelani' store. There could be a variety of reasons why older participants preferred only to visit Asian shops; for instance, they know the stores which stock the ingredients they want, and are able to communicate with people better in their own language. Language barriers could be a key factor in explaining why elderly SAs prefer to shop in Asian supermarkets. The Census 2011 highlights that the majority of the 2.4% of the population of Birmingham who cannot speak English are from a SA background (Birmingham City Council, 2013). Other participants from the various age groups who claimed to only get their ingredients from Asian supermarkets said they were familiar with the shops and trusted the quality of the products, and commented on the price of the products; participant 131 said, ''I prefer the Asian shops because they are cheaper.''"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T10:50:03.467341Z","inner_id":19,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":20,"annotations":[{"id":20,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":4415,"end":4423,"text":"diabetes","labels":["Medical

made references to the past when products such as gor (jaggery), black seed, and churan were ordered from abroad when family and friends went to visit, as they were only available in their native countries; but, now the products were readily available in the Asian shops in the UK. The two respondents who stated 'supermarket only' said this as they claimed they did not have Asian shops nearby, so relied on whatever was available in their local area. Finally, those who stated 'both Asian and chain supermarkets' commented on how ethnic ingredients were now available in Western chain supermarkets too; so went wherever was convenient. The large supermarkets are now catering for the needs of migrant communities by stocking ethnic ingredients (Retail Think Tank, 2013). As identified by the participants in this research, ingredients which were once only available from SA countries are now becoming more easily accessible from their local supermarkets; this could suggest a change in the way ingredients for traditional herbal remedies are sourced. Asian shops only Chain supermarkets only Both Asian and chainsupermarketsAsian or Western SupermarketsFigure 2-12 Where Ingredients for Herbal Remedies Were Bought From 40 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra During the research period a satellite project to investigate the availability of traditional SA HMs in Leicester was explored in collaboration with Professor Adrian Slater, Dr. Caroline Howard, Dr. Tamsyn Thring and Dr. Ketan Ruparelia. A variety of herbal products were collected from several supermarkets and SA shops around Leicester and Birmingham. The sample inventory comprised a range of products including raw ingredients (e.g. fresh karela, ginger and turmeric), seeds, powdered and dried products, as well as preformulated herbal remedies (e.g. turmeric capsules, tulsi tablets, and Chyawanprash). While collecting samples it became apparent that the products mentioned by the participants in this research were readily available. Based on work by Seethapathy et al. (2015) and Kumar et al. (2015) the research team explored the applications of DNA authentication on the herbal remedies collected. The study by Seethapathy et al. (2015) looked at authentication of medicinal plant laxatives Cassia L., Senna Mill., and Chamaecrista Moench. After collecting market samples of dried leaf, fruit, and bark material from shops across several locations in South India, they discovered the adulteration of species amongst the samples; leading them to raise concerns about the species of medicinal plants available in the Indian herbal market. Similar work by Kumar et al. (2015) also suggests there is a problem of species adulteration and substitution amongst the Indian herbal market. DNA authentication work on the herbal remedies collected in Birmingham and Leicester correctly revealed the species of the fresh samples collected. While other formulations collected such as tablets, capsules, dried turmeric root and neem leaves were not so easy to authenticate. Work to complete this study is still in progress. One of the observations highlighted was the lack of information about the ingredients of products on the labels of some of the commercial formulations brought. Some products had very little information about the ingredients while others had none at all. Furthermore, several products which had passed their sell by date and others which had their expiry dates changed by hand were bought. This raises concerns about the quality of herbal remedies available in the UK and suggests further research in required. 41 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 3: What form of herbal remedies do you use? Participants were given several options to select the types of herbal formulations they used (Figure 2-13). The most common types of herbal formulations used included: fresh herbs (e.g. mint, coriander, and fenugreek), dry powders (e.g. turmeric, cinnamon, black pepper, black salt, hing, and churan), and seeds (e.g. fennel, rye, mustard, black seed, and ajwain). Participants mentioned that as some ingredients were not readily available in the UK, they would import dried material from countries such as India and Pakistan; tulsi, turmeric and neem leaves were commonly mentioned as being imported to the UK. Liquid formulations used included: oils (e.g. olive, almond, coconut, sunflower, and mustard oil), syrups for coughs, and juices for diabetes (e.g. karela, and carrot juice). Tablets and capsules such as ginseng, Echinacea, senna, green tea, acai berry, and primrose oil were often bought from places such as Holland and Barrett, pharmacies, and other health shops. Ayurvedic and Chinese traditional herbal tablets for digestion (e.g. Triphala and churan), diabetes and weight loss were bought from India, Ramdev centres (both in the UK and abroad), and Chinese herbal shops. One of the participants who selected the 'Other' option described a sap which is harvested from the mountains in India known as Shilajeet used to improve blood circulation, good for people who have had a stroke, and has many other health benefits associated (Wilson et al., 2011). 0102030405060708090100Fresh herbs Dry Powders Seeds Tablets\/CapsulesLiquidformulationsCreams\/PastesOtherNumber of ParticipantsTypes of Herbal FormulationsHerbal Formulations UsedFigure 2-13 The Types of Herbal Formulations Used By Participants 42 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 4: After using herbal remedies do you notice any unwanted effects? If YES please state. Of the 126 participants who stated they did use herbal remedies, 87% (n=110) said they did not experience any unwanted effects after taking HMs; while 13% (n=16) claimed they had. Generally, participants commented on how HMs were natural and so safer to use, with no side-effects. Ideologies that HMs were designed by God to help people heal themselves naturally were mentioned by participants in this survey. The notion that people think HMs are natural and therefore safe has been documented by many other researchers too (Newall et al., 1996; Ipsos MORI, 2008). The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) commissioned an investigation into the public's perceptions of herbal medicines in 2008; the report revealed that just one in ten participants were aware that some HMs have side effects (Ipsos MORI, 2008). The unwanted effects reported by participants are summarised in Table 2-2. Some of the effects noted can be classed as minor as they are intermittent effects; for example excessive gas or wind produced by some herbals (participant 61) or a sore throat caused by the consumption of ginger (participant 72). Participant 42 claimed that adverse effects could be easily managed with the correct knowledge and gave the example of how the effects from 'garam' things can be counteracted by taking some orange juice, which has an opposite effect. On the other hand, some adverse effects mentioned were more serious and potentially life threatening, as reported by participant 116, who reported fresh blood in his stools after consuming HMs. Defining the concept of garam and bhye: The term 'garam' when translated into English literally means hot. Garam is a concept used by SAs to classify ingredients which warm up the body. In Ayurvedic and other traditional medical systems the term describes substances which heat the blood or warm the body temperature. Participants identified ingredients such as: ajwain, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coconut, cardamoms, dates, garlic, ginger, karela, peanuts, and turmeric as being garam. According to the research participants, when garam ingredients are consumed in excess the side-effects of an overheated internal system can include: nose bleeds, dizziness, palpitations, sweating, itching, and gastric disturbances (e.g. diarrhoea or acid reflux). Nevertheless, the importance of consuming garam foods in proportion was highlighted for keeping the body healthy, and was useful for treating conditions such as arthritis and diabetes. Some garam foods should be avoided during pregnancy due to the risk of a miscarriage; for example, mangos and papaya during the first few months, while tulsi should be avoided throughout the entire pregnancy (Winston and Maimes, 2007). During the 43 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra distribution of the questionnaire several participants made reference to Western medicines as being garam. This may be because the side-effects from CWM are similar to those experienced after consuming garam substances, or because some of the active ingredients fall into the same category as other garam substances. Participant 2 claimed, ''paracetamol is garam and I cannot take too much, as if I do I start itching, especially in my head!'' Itching is a documented side-effect caused by paracetamol (Joint Formulary Committee, 2014). There is no straight forward translation for the term 'bhye'. In contrast to garam ingredients which cause heat, bhye ingredients have the opposite effects; so Bhopal (1986b) refers to them as 'cold' substances. It is a term used to describe an internal imbalance, to which there is no equivalent term in Western medicine. Symptoms of bhye can include: nausea, feeling bloated, excessive gas production, increased salivation, and mucus production. Substances participants identified as being bhye include: rice, pulses, potatoes, carrots, turnips, melon, lemon, oranges, okra, and cauliflower. Once again it was highlighted by the research participants that these ingredients are vital for a well-balanced internal system but deficiency or excess can cause adverse effects. Table 2-2 Unwanted Effects Experienced After Using Herbal Remedies Participant Number: Unwanted Effects From Herbal Remedies Reported by Participants: 20 ''Too much of certain ingredients can cause side effects for example when I have pure honey and turmeric mixed together for a sore throat it gives a painful burning sensation.'' 22 ''Dushanda used for high temperatures gives me phlegm- because it is bhye.'' 23 ''Some types of masalas give me diarrhoea, as they are garam.'' 29 ''Mustard oil causes sickness\/ allergy.'' 40 ''Too much neem can cause dizziness (feel faint and dizzy) so to counteract this side-effect have some ghee with it.'' 42 ''If I have too much garam food like ginger or garlic, I drink some orange juice because it is bhye so will balance the imbalance.'' 47 ''Taking too much ajwain makes me dizzy.'' 61 ''Some ingredients cause wind.''

I felt like I was going to die and it was very scary. I called the Ramdev hospital where I was being treated for my diabetes and the herbal doctor just said stop taking the medicine immediately, which I did. After that experience I would never trust that medicine again, I do not know what could have happened.'' ''Feels very hot (body temperature) when has cinnamon, as it is garam.'' From the analysis of the survey it should be noted that the definition of unwanted effects or side-effects may be different amongst SA and Western communities. During the distribution of the questionnaire it was obvious that some effects caused by the consumption of HMs were not accepted as side-effects. For example, if a remedy consumed for a headache caused GI disturbances (e.g. excessive belching, diarrhoea, or flatulence) it was believed the body was excreting the excess waste products from the body to resolve the ailment. Sometimes the undesirable effects were thought to be part of the process of recovery (Pole, 2008). In addition, there are differences in diagnosis, treatment, and side-effect profiles between cultures. This can be exemplified in the diagnosis and acceptance of various health conditions, such as mental health problems. Traditionally in SA communities the cause of mental health problems may have been due to black magic\/ witchcraft\/ evil spirits, or the will of God due to previous sins and bad deeds (Time to Change, 2010). The theories behind the cause of mental health and method of treatment are different in SA and Western cultures. This highlights that traditional and Western systems may perceive and treat illnesses in diverse ways. Due diligence is required when conducting research in SA populations as concepts can easily be misinterpreted. Whilst conducting the surveys the researcher was always mindful of such differences and asked the participants to explain concepts fully. Table 2-2 Unwanted Effects Experienced After Using Herbal Remedies Continued... 45 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 5: Where did you learn about herbal remedies? Participants who said they used herbal remedies for their health, were then asked where they had gained this knowledge from (i.e. family, friends, GP, Pharmacist, educational institute, or other); 80% (n=101) of participants stated, 'from their family' (Figure 2-14). Knowledge of HMs was gained from both male and female family members. Participant 29 mentioned her grandfather was an Ayurvedic practitioner and participant 87 said her father was an Ayurvedic practitioner. However, most participants made reference to their mums as being the main source of learning about HMs. The transmission of knowledge of HMs has been passed on by word of mouth throughout history, from one generation to the next (Chhetri, 1994; Thring and Weitz, 2006; Bhatia et al., 2014). This reinforces the key role that family play in passing on this valuable knowledge. Throughout the SATMED questionnaire any references to family and friends is combined in the option 'family\/ friends'; this is because in SA cultures friends are often referred to as family, as are neighbours and people from the same village. The distinction between family and friends is not always the same as in Western cultures. However, for the purpose of this question, to establish exactly where participants learnt about HMs, the option was split into individual components i.e. family or friends instead of family and friends. Just three participants (2%) specified that they had learnt about HMs from their friends. One participant (1%) said she learnt about HMs from her school in India, as it was part of the curriculum. The option of GP or Pharmacist was not selected by any of the respondents. Participants who selected 'other' as their option (17%, n=21) for this question, said they learnt about HMs from a variety of places such as: the television (in particular the Asian channels such as Astha which airs Baba Ramdev remedies, and ZeeTV), radio, internet (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube), herbal shops (e.g. Holland and Barrett), traditional healers, and from their religion (two participants spoke about the value of black seed in Islam). There was some discussion amongst participants about how the media was introducing them to HMs. Several participants claimed while using social media websites 80%2%1% 17%Participants Learnt About Herbal Remedies From:FamilyFriendsEducationalinstituteOtherFigure 2-14 Where Participants Learnt About Herbal Remedies 46 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra and applications, such as Facebook and Twitter, the adverts which pop up are often about HMs. Usually HMs for hair and weight loss were advertised; however, this had led the participants to look into other HMs of interest. Participants 120 and 123 explained that they often researched on the internet for natural remedies. As did participant 165 who said she often watched YouTube videos to see how to make various herbal facemasks for her acne. Kanthe (2010) suggests the media can have a significant role in influencing peoples' decision to try herbal products; this was true for some of the participants in this study. The results from this question have revealed that the principle route of transmission of knowledge of HMs is from family. The traditional knowledge of HMs has often been passed on from parents and grandparents. Each family may have their own formulation, dosage, and duration of treatment which has been optimised through generations of traditional use (Bhamra, 2011). However, with advances in technology, popularity of social media, and the ease of access to a vast array of information, the way people are learning about HMs is changing (Hegg, 2013). 47 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The following questions are inclusive of all 192 participants responses. Question 6: Is herbal medicine part of your traditional family & cultural background? SA countries are rich sources of natural remedies and are renowned for their long standing use of HMs (Bhatia et al., 2014). Pieroni et al. (2010) claims that HMs are embedded in the cultural heritage of SAs and is a representation of identity of migrant communities. This question was asked to determine the current status of such traditions amongst SA populations in the UK, and to determine whether or not the knowledge of HMs is being passed onto generations born in the UK. WHO (2008) states that in some Asian and African countries more than 80% of the population still depends on traditional HMs for their primary health care. In this study the majority of participants are first generation immigrants (n=108) or second generation citizens (n=75) in the UK; therefore, it is assumed that HMs will be part of their traditional family background. The significant majority of participants in this research (85%, n=163) said HMs were part of their heritage; this suggests that SA communities in the UK are aware of the traditional use of HMs, regardless of whether or not they use HMs themselves (Figure 2-15). Only 15% (n=29) of participants said HMs were not part of their traditional family background. Analysis of the results revealed that most of the participants who stated HMs were not part of their traditional family and cultural background were in the young age group (n=15, of which 12 participants were second generation citizens), born in the UK (n=16), with at least one or both parents also born in the UK."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T10:52:07.279778Z","inner_id":20,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":21,"annotations":[{"id":21,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":2342,"end":2350,"text":"diabetes","labels":["Medical

only a small number of participants claimed HMs were not part of their traditional family background, claims such as a loss of transmission of knowledge to SAs in the UK cannot be made; although, during data collection one participants did suggest that this was the case. Participant 39 commented on how Westernised her own children had become that they did not even let her use HMs which she knew worked, they only used CWM and never considered the use of HMs despite it being part of their heritage. It was also noted that two participants claimed their families only ever used CWM; thus, they were not aware of traditional or cultural practices of HMs. 020406080100120140No YesNumber of ParticipantsDo Participants Use Herbal MedicinesTraditional and Personal Use Of Herbal Medicines Yes-HerbalMedicines Are Partof TraditionalBackgroundNo- HerbalMedicines Are NotPart of TraditionalBackgroundFigure 2-15 Participants Personal Use of Herbal Medicines and Traditional Heritage 48 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 7: How often do you use herbal medicines? This question adopts a modification of the Likert scale to determine the frequency of use of HMs. Initially, the questionnaire was designed with the options: very frequently, frequently, occasionally, rarely and never; however, after review these options were changed to daily, weekly, monthly, when required, and never, to better determine the use of HMs. Participants were asked how often they used HMs to determine how frequently they were used by the research sample (Figure 2-16). The majority of participants (48%, n=92) claimed to use herbal remedies 'when required'. Remedies such as: cardamom pods for nausea, cloves for toothache, honey and lemon for coughs, and aloe vera for skin conditions were commonly used when required. The 26% of participants (n=50) who stated they used herbal remedies 'daily' mentioned taking substances such as cinnamon to lower cholesterol, ajwain for digestion, masala tea and turmeric milk for general health and wellbeing. Out of these 50 participant who used herbal remedies daily just over half (56%, n=28) were elderly participants. The few participants (3%, n=5) who claimed to use herbal remedies 'weekly' made reference to not taking too much of various ingredients as they are garam so should only be consumed in moderation; karela for diabetes and some masalas were amongst those that should be consumed in moderation. Despite 66 participants claiming they did not use any HMs for themselves in the first question, only 44 participants said they 'never' used herbal remedies in this question. This implies the 22 participants who selected alternative options may have later realised that they did sometimes use HMs. This would suggest that more of the research participants do actually use HMs than first thought. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100NeverWhen requiredMonthlyWeeklyDailyNumber of Participants Frequency of use Frequency of Herbal Medicine UseFigure 2-16 How Frequently Participants Used Herbal Medicines 49 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The following question was divided into two parts; the first section (a) asks participants to list any herbal remedies, products, or ingredients they know which have medicinal benefits; while the second section (b) focuses specifically on medicinal plants. Question 8A: List as many herbal remedies, products or ingredients you know of... The aim of this question was to explore participants' knowledge of HMs. The first draft of the questionnaire asked participants to list 'herbal remedies' they knew of; however, after reviewing the feedback from the pilot study the terms 'herbal remedies, products or ingredients' were used to stimulate participants to think about different HMs they knew of. The refined wording in the question acted as a prompt which permitted for a wider range of responses, without influencing participants' answers (Harris and Brown, 2010). Participants were asked to list as many products as they could think of which were good for their health or had medicinal values, even if they did not personally use them. The results exemplify a vast range of herbal remedies known and used by the research sample (Appendix 5). Figure 2-17 represents the number of items recalled by participants; this includes the individual ingredients which may be used to formulate a herbal remedy and commercial products. Only 7% (n=13) of the research population were unable to list any herbal products in this question. The mean (M) number of responses per participant was seven. The highest number of products recalled was by participant 16 who listed thirty products. The most popular product mentioned by 57% (n=109) of participants was turmeric. Other frequently mentioned items included: ginger, ajwain, fennel, cinnamon, garlic, aloe vera, clove, tulsi, black pepper, neem, and black seed. Various nuts (e.g. almonds and walnuts), teas (e.g. green tea, nettle tea, and masala tea), and oils (e.g. olive, mustard, eucalyptus, sesame, castor, sunflower, and fish oil), were also mentioned (Appendix 5). 05101520250 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 +Number of participantsNumber of items recalled Number of Herbal Remedies Listed Figure 2-17 The Number of Herbal Remedies Recalled by Participants 50 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 8B: What plants do you know that have medicinal benefits? Part B of the question asked participants to specifically name any plants which had medicinal benefits; Figure 2-18 represents the number of plants recalled by participants. The majority of participants (24%, n=46) recalled at least one medicinal plant (M = 2), the maximum number of plants listed by one participant was twelve. Aloe vera was the most frequently mentioned plant by 41% (n=80) of participants, followed by mint (28%, n=54) and tulsi (23%, n=44). Participants said they used aloe vera for skin conditions (e.g. eczema, itchy skin, burns, and skin irritation), diabetes, and arthritis. The gel contained in the fleshy leaves of the aloe vera plant has been associated with anti-inflammatory and wound healing effects which have been linked to the mannose-6-phosphate sugar component (Davis et al., 1994). Other traditional uses of aloe vera include its use in treating tooth aches, aiding the recovery of mouth ulcers, stomach and duodenal ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, and its immune boosting effects (Chevallier, 2007) Various fruits (e.g. amla, cranberry, dates, oranges, and figs), vegetables (e.g. broccoli, carrots, and karela), and herbs (e.g. basil, coriander, fenugreek, rosemary, and parsley) were documented. Other products such as ajwain, cannabis, cinnamon, chillies, curry leaves, dandelion, fennel, ginger, neem, nettles, rose, spinach, and turmeric were also cited by participants (Appendix 5). Despite having successfully named multiple herbal products in part A, 21% (n=30) of participants failed to name any plants with medicinal benefits in this section. This could have been because participants did not want to repeat themselves from part A as they had already listed numerous products; or because participants did not know of any medicinal plants, as suggested by participant 8 who listed nine herbal remedies in part A but said he could not name any plants. Some participants (2%, n=4) were able to recall more products when they were asked specifically about plants with medicinal benefits in comparison to section A of this question. The ways people use plants is dynamic (Heinrich et al., 2006); the range of plants recalled by participants illustrates that they had a considerable wealth of knowledge of medicinal plants (Appendix 5). 010203040500 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10+Number of participantsNumber of plants recalled Number of Medicinal Plants ListedFigure 2-18 The Number of Medicinal Plants Recalled by Participants 51 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 9: Do you know any herbal remedies or products which can be used for the following conditions? In this question participants were presented with seven health conditions a mixture of minor and serious health problems (i.e. arthritis, cough, diabetes, headache, indigestion, itchy skin, and wounds) and asked to state any HMs they knew of which could be used to treat or manage the conditions. The rationale for selecting these conditions is because they are amongst some of the most popular health problems people seek treatment for in the UK (PAGB, 2009). Conditions such as cough, headache, indigestion and skin disorders are amongst the top ten ailments treated over the counter (OTC) and may be considered as minor health problems (PAGB, 2009; Pharmacy Research UK, 2014). Arthritis affects around 10 million people in the UK (NHS, 2014). Research into arthritis and ethnic minority groups in the UK has found that some forms of arthritis appear to be more common and more severe in SA ethnic groups (Samanta et al., 1992; Samanta et al., 2005). It is estimated that 3.3 million people in the UK have diabetes (Diabetes UK, 2015); SAs in the UK are up to six times more likely to have diabetes than the Caucasian population (Khunti et al., 2009). These health problems can have a serious impact on peoples' lives; despite this little is known about how the conditions are managed by SA populations (Khunti et al., 2009). By investigating participants knowledge of HMs used for these conditions a better understanding of alternative therapies used for these health problems can be assessed. The majority of participants (86%, n=165) were able to list treatments for one or more of the conditions (Figure 2-19); just 8% (n=15) of participants listed a remedy for each of the seven conditions. Of the total population surveyed, 14% (n=27) were unable to state herbal remedies for any of the conditions listed. Figure 2-19 represents whether or not participants stated a response for each of the health conditions. It is evident that more participants were able to recall remedies for conditions such as a cough (n=151), indigestion (n=127), and wounds (n=98) in comparison to arthritis (n=65), diabetes (n=68), and headache (n=63). As cough, indigestion, and skin conditions are amongst the top ten conditions treated OTC in the UK (PAGB, 2009); this could explain why more participants knew of HMs to treat them in comparison to the other conditions. 020406080100120140160Number of participantsHealth conditionsHerbal Remedies Known For Health ConditionsYesNoFigure 2-19 Herbal Remedies Known for the Health Conditions Listed 52 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Figure 2-20 represents HMs stated by participants for each condition organised according to the age ranges - young, middle aged and older; it illustrates that for conditions such as itchy skin there was a similar number of responses from young, middle aged and older participants (n=25, 26, 26 respectively). For conditions such as cough and wounds there were more responses from younger participants than the other age groups. While, conditions such as arthritis and diabetes there were more responses from the middle aged and older participants in comparison to the younger participants. Although arthritis and diabetes can affect people of all ages (Arthritis Research UK, 2013a; Diabetes UK, 2015), middle aged and older participants appeared to have better knowledge of how to treat and manage them with HMs in comparison to younger participants. Ginger was mentioned for its use in arthritis (n=9); due to its anti-inflammatory action which can help with the pain and loss of mobility caused by the condition (Grzanna et al., 2005). The notion that ginger is garam and thus improves circulation was frequently documented. It could be eaten in its raw form, soaked in water over night and the liquid taken in the morning, infused in tea, or incorporated into daily meals. Ginger powder, tablets, beverages, and many other formulations are now readily available and there is a vast amount of literature which supports the medicinal claims associated with its use (Polunin and Robbins, 1992; Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). Ali et al. (2008) say the anti-inflammatory effects of ginger have been known for centuries; although, evidence was only made available when research conducted identified the active components in ginger and claimed they worked like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); moreover, ginger avoids the side-effects caused by NSAIDs. Ginger is known to contain a mixture of biologically active compounds which work in different ways to reduce inflammation; i.e. some compounds have an inhibitory effect on the production of inflammatory cytokines, while others inhibit the proliferation of inflammatory cells (Ali et al., 2008; Bartels et al., 2015). Fenugreek was 010203040506070Number of ParticipantsConditionHerbal Medicines For Health Conditions By Age Range YoungParticipantsMiddle agedParticipantsOlderParticipantsFigure 2-20 Herbal Medicines Cited for Each Condition by the Different Age Groups 53 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra another popular remedy recommended for arthritis (n=10); the fresh or dried leaves could be incorporated in cooking or infused in tea, the seeds could be ground and blended with other herbs, or soaked overnight in water and drank the next morning. Massaging the affected joints with various oils was also recommended, including: black seed oil, flax seed oil, and garlic oil - made by infusing cloves of garlic in olive or mustard oil. There was a clear warning to avoid sour or acidic foods such as yoghurt, oranges, and lemons as they were believed to make the condition worse. Participant 62 claimed, ''lemon is very bad for arthritis, anything acidic should be avoided.'' However, there is no evidence to suggest cutting these substances out of the diet helps with arthritis; if anything they are an important source of nutrients so should be consumed as part of a balanced diet (Arthritis Research UK, 2013b). For the treatment of coughs there were several common herbal remedies suggested; 50% (n=76) of participants listed honey as being useful to sooth a cough of which half (n=38) recommended taking it with lemon. While others suggested combining honey with black pepper, ginger, brandy, cinnamon, or turmeric. Honey is made up of a mixture of compounds which give it anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and antioxidant effects which explain why it has been used in traditional medicine for coughs (Oduwole et al., 2014). Liquorish, mint, tulsi, fennel, black seed, banaksha, and salt water gargles were also listed as being used for a cough. Banaksha (Viola odorata L., sweet violet) has traditionally been used to treat cough, catarrh, fever, headache and pain, hence its popularity for relieving the symptoms of coughs and colds (Bhatia et al., 2014). For diabetes it was well known that there was no cure for the condition but blood glucose (BG) levels could be managed and kept in control by the consumption of HMs. Of the 68 participants who listed a herbal remedy for diabetes, 56% (n=38) mentioned the hypoglycaemic properties of karela (Momordica charantia L.). Participant 107 claimed, ''karela is good for diabetes as bitter things can be used to counteract the sugar.'' Fresh karelas are widely available in the UK and can be consumed as a curry, juiced, or soaked overnight in water. Various commercial karela formulations are also available, including: dry powder, concentrated juice, and tablets. There is an abundance of research conducted on the use of karela in diabetes around the world (Baxter, 2008; Pandey et al., 2011; Lone et al., 2012). There are several proposed methods which can explain the hypoglycaemic effects of karela; it is believed to reduce glucose absorption, increase glucose uptake in liver cells, and improve insulin secretion (Jayasooriya et al., 2000). Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) was mentioned by 16% (n=11) of participants who highlighted the anti-diabetic properties were best obtained by soaking the seeds in water over night, or consuming the leaves regularly as part of the diet. Studies have shown that fenugreek can stimulate glucose 54 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra uptake into cells and plays a part in activating the insulin secretion signalling pathway; thus, helping reduce BG levels and improving insulin response in diabetics (Vijaykumar et al., 2005; Chevallier, 2007). Other products described by participants for diabetes included: tulsi infused in water or tea, turmeric with milk, ginger mixed with cinnamon and honey, honey to substitute other sugars, figs soaked in milk overnight, gram flour chapattis instead of wheat flour, okra as a curry or soaked in water over night, amla, cinnamon, chick peas, curry leaves, olives, grapefruit, and neem. Just 63 participants (33%) said they knew of HMs which could be used to treat a headache. The first response from many participants was often 'paracetamol' but participants were reminded that this research was focused on HMs, so these responses were disregarded. Herbal remedies to treat a headache included: massage the head with oil (olive, almond, coconut, or mustard oil), drink plenty of water, masala tea, mint tea, ginger tea, ginger infused in water, holy water, honey in hot water, ajwain seeds chewed or infused in water or tea, millet flour compress on forehead, menthol rubbed onto forehead, steam inhalation with menthol crystals, cloves warmed and the fumes released inhaled, and black pepper chewed or infused in tea. Participant 85 claimed, ''you do not get headache if your digestion is ok.'' This point was also highlighted by several other participants and an Ayurvedic practitioner (Dr. Pankanj Chansarkar, Kerala), who described the anatomy and explained the causes of a headache."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T10:55:01.113161Z","inner_id":21,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":22,"annotations":[{"id":22,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":737,"end":750,"text":"digestive

Chansarkar was introduced to the researcher during a field trip to Kerala in April 2014, where he explained how according to Ayurveda the build-up of gasses (digestive impurities) in the alimentary canal feedback and signal pain receptors which are recognised as a headache. According to Dr. Chansarkar a headache is a sign that there is insufficient clearing of the digestive tract. He recommended a digestive aid (Triphala- a mixture of amla, beleric and harad) to help clear the gastro-intestinal tract in order to eliminate the headache. Ajwain is a bitter tasting, aromatic seed that is rich in essential oils which contain thymol. It is commonly used in cooking to add flavour and has numerous health benefits; it is a popular digestive aid which can help with gastro-intestinal ailments (i.e. flatulence, diarrhoea, and indigestion) and provides anti-spasmodic, laxative, and pain relief effects (Bairwa et al., 2012). It appears many of the research participants in this study who treated headaches with a digestive aid were aware of this traditional knowledge which is not well documented. Indigestion is a common ailment which causes a discomfort in the upper abdomen, often associated with a bloated sensation, nausea and excessive belching. It was uncovered that SA communities in this research used the term 'gas' to describe these symptoms. The pathophysiology is the same; participants had a clear understanding of what indigestion was and how to treat it. Indigestion may be experienced due to eating 'heavy' meals (large portions, high fat or fried foods), stress, medication, or because of poor metabolism. From 55 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra the results (Figure 2-19) it is clearly a condition many of the participants have knowledge of how to treat; 66% of participants (n=127) surveyed stated one or more herbal remedies to treat indigestion. Remedies including: ajwain, black salt, cardamom, fennel, lemon water, mint, milk, hing, and churan were recommended for treating indigestion. Churan (also known as churna) is a digestive powder composed of several ingredients including ginger, cumin, ajwain, rock salt, black pepper, fenugreek, hing, and fennel; although, different manufacturers may have their own recipes (Chaudhury and Rafei, 2001). There are a variety of commercial products available for itchy skin which are based on HMs. Most of the products recommended by participants for itchy skin were topical preparations such as the sap from the aloe vera plant rubbed onto the skin (mentioned by 35% of respondents, n=27), oils (almond, coconut, mustard, and olive oil) and pastes (turmeric with yoghurt or olive oil, crushed garlic, onion juice, or a mixture of honey and cinnamon). A large number of participants (40%, n=31) suggested using an oil to stop the itching as it would moisturise the skin and reduce the dryness, which makes the itch-scratch cycle worse (Yosipovitch and Hundley, 2004). Other remedies were formulated to be ingested to provide systemic relief from the itching such as: turmeric in milk several times a week, dried neem leaves mixed with honey to make small balls taken daily, neem leaves infused in warm water or tea. The final condition participants were asked to detail a herbal remedy for was wounds; 98 participants (51%) stated a remedy they knew of which could be used for wounds. A considerable number of participants (77%, n=75) listed the benefits of turmeric for aiding wound healing. There were several methods of preparation and administration noted. Some participants claimed turmeric should be made in to a drink by warming with milk and drinking it every night; some recommended adding black pepper, clarified butter (ghee) or olive oil. While others preferred to use a topical formulation to give a local effect by making a paste with oil (e.g. olive oil or mustard oil), ghee, or water. The medicinal value of turmeric is undergoing extensive investigation. It has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory action which may explain its traditional use in wound healing. The antimicrobial function prevents bacterial proliferation when the skins defences have been breached; while the anti-inflammatory action will help the wound heal quicker (Colalto, 2010). Various other topical and internal preparations were also recommended for wounds including: the use of neem, honey, aloe vera and some even suggested rubbing salt directly into a wound to stop it bleeding. A list of the herbal remedies documented by participants can be found in Appendix 5. 56 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Participants' Knowledge of Herbal Medicines Participants' knowledge of HMs was measured by calculating the total number of 'items' recalled; this included any ingredients, products or remedies participants mentioned throughout the entire survey. Each response was given a value of one and this was added up to give the total number of items recalled, if an item was mentioned several times it was only counted once. Figure 2-21 illustrates the total number of items recalled increased as more questions were asked in comparison to Figure 2-17, which just looked at participants responses from question 8A. The proportion of participants who did not state any herbal products reduced from 7% (n=13) to 5% (n=10); while, those who recalled twenty or more items increased from 3% (n= 6) to 10% (n=19). The reason for an increased number of items recalled could be due to the prompts given, i.e. asking participants' to identify medicinal plants or products for specific health conditions (Harris and Brown, 2010); or even because participants had more time to think about herbal remedies as the questionnaire progressed. Question eight alone would not be sufficient to judge the participants knowledge of HMs; but, by having additional sections and questions a better indication of knowledge can be assessed. The results demonstrate that there was a great wealth of knowledge of HMs amongst the research sample. There are various parametric techniques which can be used to explore the relationships between variables in this data. For example, a t-test can be used when there are two defined groups in a variable; i.e. it can be used to explore the relationship between the difference in knowledge across male and female participants. While analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques can be employed when there are two or more groups within a variable; i.e. to determine the difference in knowledge across the different age groups (Pallant, 2007). 051015200 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 +Number of participantsNumber of items recalled Participants Total Knowledge of Herbal MedicinesFigure 2-21 SATMED Participants' Total Knowledge of Herbal Medicines 57 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Independent sample t-test An independent sample t-test can be used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between two variables. It can be used to explore the differences in the mean number of responses between male and female respondents. Table 2-3 identifies the number of male and female participants (N), and summarises the mean (M) number of items recalled for each group, along with the standard deviation (SD). The mean number of responses per female participant was 11 (SD = 7.01), and for male participants M = 7 (SD = 6.18). From this it can be concluded that the male participants recalled fewer items but there was less variance in their results. Table 2-3 T-test Group Statistics Gender N Mean number or responses Standard Deviation Male 60 7 6.18 Female 132 11 7.01 Table 2-4 Independent Samples T-test The first part of Table 2-4 indicates the 'Levene's Test for Equality of Variances' which tests whether the variation for the two groups is the same. If the significance probability (Sig) value (P) is greater than 0.05 then results from 'equal variances assumed' should be used; whereas a lower Sig value indicates results from 'equal variances not assumed' should be used. In this instance the Sig value is 0.131, as this is larger than the standard of 0.05, equal variances can be assumed (Pallant, 2007). The Sig. (2-tailed) result is then used to see if there is a significant difference between the two groups (i.e. male and female participants), if this value is equal to or less than 0.05 it suggests there is a significant difference between the means of the two genders, whereas a higher value would suggest there is no significant difference. Table 2-4 shows that the Sig (2-tailed) value p = 0.001, this is lower than the Independent Samples Test Levene's Test for Equality of Variances t-test for Equality of Means F Sig. t df Sig. (2-tailed) Mean Difference Standard Error Difference 95% Confidence Interval of the Difference Lower Upper Equal variances assumed 2.297 0.131 3.386 190 0.001 3.565 1.053 1.488 5.642 Equal variances not assumed 3.550 128 0.001 3.565 1.004 1.578 5.552 58 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra standard 0.05; therefore, this indicates there is a significant difference between the mean number of items recalled by male and female participants (Pallant, 2007; Petrovics, 2012). Effect size statistics can then be used to provide an insight into the strength of the association to show that the results have not just occurred due to chance, as well as highlighting the statistical significance (Pallant, 2007; Petrovics, 2012). Eta squared is one way of calculating the effect size statistic. The eta squared value can range from 0 to 1 and can be interpreted in the following way: 0.01 is a small effect, 0.06 is a moderate effect, and 0.14 is a large effect (Cohen, 1988). The following formula is used to calculate eta squared: Eta squared = ________t2_______ t2 + (N12 + N2 - 2) Eta squared = ________3.3862_______ 3.3862 + (60 + 132 - 2) = 0.06 The eta squared value of 0.06 suggests there is a moderate association, that this is a significant finding and not just because of chance. In summary, the results from of the t-test and eta square confirm there is a difference in knowledge between the two genders; female participants had more knowledge of HMs in comparison to male participants. This is supported by the Mintel Report (2009), which claims women have more knowledge of HMs, thus they use them more than men. Furthermore, Ernst (2000) also states that women of all ages use HMs more frequently than men. Male participants in this investigation claimed they did not take any HMs for their health (in question 1), but later revealed they did take HMs given to them by their grandparents, mother or wife (question 6). This supports the nurturing role females have been associated with throughout history (Ehrenreich and English, 1973; Hegg, 2013). The traditional role for SA women was as the house keeper; which involved cooking and looking after their husband and children once they started their own families (Samanta, 1999; Chaudhury and Rafei, 2001). As women were the ones who have traditionally been the main cooks in the home they were best equipped with the knowledge of how to use food as medicines (Jennings, 2014). This nursing and caring role women have been traditionally associated with is evidently still common amongst SA communities in the UK; where female participants appear to have more knowledge of HMs than males. 59 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Analysis of Variance An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests the hypothesis that the means of two or more variables are equal (Minitab Inc, 2014). It compares the variance between the groups, enabling conclusions to be made regarding variations among results (Pallant, 2007). A one-way ANOVA can be used to compare the variance between groups in an independent variable; for example; how knowledge (dependent variable) varies with age (independent variable). The Null hypothesis would be that knowledge is equal despite age; while the Alternative hypothesis would be that there is a difference in knowledge between the age groups. Table 2-5 summarises the mean number of responses given by each age group, with the standard deviation, standard error, and 95% confidence intervals for the mean. Table 2-5 ANOVA Summary of Participants Age and Mean Number of Herbal Medicines Recalled Age N Mean Standard Deviation Standard Error 95% Confidence Interval for Mean Lower Bound Upper Bound 20 or under 43 6 6.121 0.933 4.77 8.54 21 - 30 years 47 8 5.207 0.760 6.88 9.93 31 - 40 years 10 12 5.633 1.781 8.77 16.83 41 - 50 years 12 13 11.156 3.220 6.50 20.67 51 - 60 years 21 13 7.423 1.620 9.62 16.38 61 years + 59 12 6.346 0.826 10.55 13.86 Total 192 10 6.945 0.501 9.25 11.22 Table 2-5 identifies that the mean number of responses increases with age. A potential reason for the slightly lower mean for the 61+ age group is because during data collection it was noted that some of the older participants were reluctant to share their knowledge or take HMs at the same time as taking Western medicines. As reflected by participant 125, 'I do not want to tell anyone about any herbal remedies as if something goes wrong people will blame me. I have so much knowledge about herbal remedies but I am scared to share it, in this country people do not want to know!' In addition, many of the participants in the 61+ age group took prescription medicines for various health conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and commented on how they had stopped using HMs. This was mentioned by several participants including participant 112 who claimed, 'I do not take any herbal remedies, I only take the doctors medicines because I have to,' and participant 115 who said, ''I do not really use much herbal remedies now, I just take my prescription medicines.'' 60 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 2-6 ANOVA Summary of Variance between Participants Age and Number of Responses Sum of Squares Degrees of freedom Mean Square F Sig. Between Groups 1299.291 5 259.858 6.108 0.00003 Within Groups 7913.163 186 42.544 Total 9212.453 191 - Table 2-6 represents the results of the ANOVA test which shows the sum of squares, which is a measure of variation or deviation from the mean, and degrees of freedom (Minitab Inc, 2014). If the Sig value is less than or equal to 0.05 there is a significant difference among the mean scores of the dependent variable. The sig value indicated in Table 2-6 is 0.00003; consequently this shows there is a significant difference in the mean results. The F test represents the variance between the groups divided by the variance within each group. A significant F ratio would suggest there is more variability between the groups, due to the independent variable (i.e. the total knowledge) than there is within the group. If the F value is around 1 we can assume the null hypothesis is correct (Pallant, 2007). Table 2-6 identified that the F value is 6.108 thus the null hypothesis, that there are no significant differences in number of responses between the different age groups, needs to be rejected; while, the Alternative hypothesis, that there is a difference in knowledge between the age groups, can be accepted. To calculate the effect size the following formula can be used: Eta squared = Sum of squares between groups = 1299.291 Total sum of squares 9212.453 = 0.14 The one-way between-groups ANOVA was conducted to explore the impact of age on total knowledge (i.e. the number of herbal remedies participants recalled). The results show there was a statistically significant difference as p < 0.05 and F test results show: p = 0.0003, F = 6.108. The effect size calculated using Eta squared, was 0.14 indicating a large effect; reinforcing a statistically significant result, that knowledge was different across the various age groups (Pallant, 2007). The results of the ANOVA test suggest there is a difference in knowledge of HMs amongst the different age groups. Although, the knowledge of HMs is transmitted to younger SA generations in the UK, as exemplified by their responses throughout this investigation, the older participants still had more knowledge of HMs. This is supported by Pieroni et al. (2010) who also found that middle-aged and older Bangladeshi 61 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra participants in their research had better knowledge of traditional HMs than younger participants. 2.6.3 The Use of Prescription Medication This section of the questionnaire set out to investigate whether or not participants took prescribed CWM alongside HMs. Participants were asked what CWM they were prescribed by their doctor, nurse, pharmacist or other HCPs, to explore the safety of consuming HMs, and the potential interactions between HMs and CWM. Participants were asked whether or not they shared information about their use of HMs with their HCPs, to gain insight into the relationship between SA patients and their HCPs. In addition, the side-effects reported from CWM and HMs were compared. Question 10 A: Do you take any regular prescribed medicines? 10 B: If Yes, and you are happy to say please state what medicines you take. All of the research participants (n=192) were asked whether or not they took any regular prescribed medicines; of which more than half of the population (55%, n=106) stated they did. This included the treatment for a range of health problems including: pain relief, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, topical treatments for skin conditions, and vitamins to supplement deficiencies (Table 2-7)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T11:00:11.726342Z","inner_id":22,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":23,"annotations":[{"id":23,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":5940,"end":5953,"text":"digestive

Table 2-7 summarises the medical conditions and medicines listed by participants. The results revealed that participants were taking medication for a vast range of health conditions; the most common conditions mentioned were hypertension (n=47), diabetes (n=36), and high cholesterol (n=25). Other common health problems included thyroid disorders, asthma, and allergies. The types of CWM taken can be categorised by age groups; medicines such as the contraceptive pill, acne treatments, and iron supplements were common in younger females (aged less than 20 to 30 years). The few young males who said they took regular prescribed medication used inhalers for asthma. Medicines for arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions were generally mentioned by the latter half of the middle aged group (51-60 years) and elderly age group (61 years plus). Vitamins, topical preparations for skin conditions, thyroid disorder medication, and asthma treatments were mentioned by both genders and all age ranges.

The simultaneous use of HMs and CWM can have serious consequences; by asking participants what HMs and prescription medicines they took, the information could be used to identify any potential interactions. At the time of conducting the surveys the researcher 63 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra did not intend on identifying interactions and making participants aware; there was a disclaimer to inform participants to speak to their HCPs if they had any queries about their medication, which the DMU ethics committee advised the researcher to include. By looking at the list of CWM and HMs participants consumed, a range of adverse effects and potential interactions can be identified. Fugh-Berman (2000) says, ''concurrent use of herbs may mimic, magnify, or oppose the effect of drugs.'' Williamson et al. (2013) identifies an interaction when the effect of a drug is changed by the presence of another substance; this includes herbal medicines and food. HMs can alter the drugs pharmacokinetics by affecting the drugs absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. Cytochrome (CYP) P450 are a group of enzymes which metabolise a variety of substrates and have an important role in drug metabolism; the rate of enzyme activity can be affected by numerous herbal products. Some products may increase the rate of metabolism (enzyme inducers), rendering the drug ineffective at sub-therapeutic levels if metabolised too fast; alternatively if the drug is metabolised slower than anticipated, it can accumulate and cause toxicity. Tovar and Petzel (2009) claim, ''Garlic is safe when used in dietary amounts''; however, consumption at higher doses and stronger concentrations for medicinal purposes may be associated with underlying risks especially if used simultaneously with other drugs. Garlic has an enzyme inducing effect; therefore, it can reduce the effectiveness of drugs metabolised by CYP 3A4 (Spurgeon, 2000; Foster et al., 2001). Ponnusankar et al. (2011) investigated the effects of Triphala, a popular Ayurvedic mixture with multiple health benefits, on the CYP 450 enzyme; they found the three components of Triphala (amla, beleric and harad) caused inhibition of the enzyme; thus, reducing drug metabolism. Other interactions can be caused by HMs if they affect the drugs pharmacodynamics by imitating or inhibiting a drugs mode of action (Chavez et al., 2006). One of the most frequently mentioned herbal ingredients was ginger, cited 179 times during the surveys. Its use as an anti-emetic, digestive aid, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and for coughs and colds was commonly identified by participants. Ginger can have hypoglycaemic effects; hence, if consumed with other anti-diabetic medicines the risks associated with low blood glucose (BG) levels may be fatal (Newall et al., 1996). Fenugreek, karela, garlic, turmeric, tulsi and aloe vera were also identified by participants as being used in diabetes to lower BG. Researchers who have explored the hypoglycaemic properties of fenugreek have found it to be a very powerful anti-diabetic agent due to the actives: gonelline, nicotinic acid and coumarin found in the defatted portion of the seed (Pandey et al., 2011). A significant reduction in BG levels caused by taking HMs could lead to poor diabetic control, interactions with medication, and serious health risks for the patient (Sethi et al., 2004). 64 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Cloves have been traditionally used as digestive aids and for toothache, due to their carminative and analgesic effects. With a high eugonel content, which inhibits platelet aggregation, interactions between conventional anti-platelets (aspirin and clopidogrel) and anti-coagulants (warfarin) have been identified (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). This is also true for many other herbals including: garlic, ginger, hing, fenugreek and turmeric which can increase blood clotting time (Newall et al., 1996; Spurgeon, 2000). People are at an increased risk of haemorrhage due to the dual blood thinning effect of combining CWM with HMs (Heck et al., 2005). Liquorice was often used by participants to treat coughs and upper respiratory tract congestion. Large quantities and long term ingestion has been associated with hypokalaemia and hypertension (Lin et al., 2003; Chevallier, 2007). Due to its stimulant and fluid retention properties liquorice has been known to increase blood pressure, rendering anti-hypertensive medicines less effective (Williamson et al., 2013). If taken with prescription diuretics (e.g. Bendroflumethiazide or Furosemide), which are known to be associated with hypokalaemia, potassium levels may fall below optimum levels. Hypokalaemia is usually asymptomatic so people may not be aware of the consequences; however, sometimes it may present as symptoms of weakness, muscle cramp, constipation and palpitations (Lederer and Batuman, 2014). Without the correct knowledge, this may not be identified or treated appropriately. The incidence of interaction with CWM and HMs is not fully known; Williamson et al. (2013) highlight that despite this many HCPs openly admit they lack knowledge in this area. The insufficient reporting of interactions and adverse effects may be due to inadequate training or a lack of knowledge of how to report them. Interactions between HMs and CWM may exist; but, if people do not tell their doctors and pharmacists they will not be able to intervene. Alternatively, people may not be aware there is an interaction or adverse effect as they do not always present with symptoms. 65 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 11: Do you tell your (a) doctor and (b) pharmacist what herbal remedies you use? Figure 2-23 illustrates the responses of whether or not the participants who took regular prescribed medication told their doctor and\/or pharmacist about their use of HMs. Of the 106 participants who did take regular prescribed medication, 13% of participants (n=14) did not consume any HMs, so they answered 'not applicable'. Just 18% of participants (n=19) said they did tell their doctor, and only 5% (n=5) told their pharmacist about herbal remedies they took alongside their prescription medicines. A significant proportion of participants (69%, n=73) revealed they did not tell their doctor and even more (82%, n=87) declared they did not tell their pharmacist. Similar findings were illustrated by a study conducted by Bhopal (1986a), who found participants did not tell their doctor about herbal remedies as they felt it was a separate matter. Results from the Ipsos MORI report (2008) revealed that 20% of respondents in their survey did not think there was any need to inform their general practitioner (GP) about HMs they used; while 56% felt it was important to tell their GP. Table 2-8 summarises the reasons why participants in this study did not tell their doctor or pharmacist about their use of HMs. 0102030405060708090Doctor PharmacistNumber of participantsDo Participants Tell Their Doctor or Pharmacist About Their Use of Herbal Medicines?YesNoNot applicableFigure 2-23 Do Participants Tell Their Doctor or Pharmacist about Their Use of Herbal Medicines? 66 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 2-8 Participants Reasons for Not Telling Healthcare Professionals about Their Personal Use of Herbal Medicines Participant Number: Reasons For Not Telling Healthcare Professionals About Personal Use of Herbal Medicines: 67 ''I do not tell the doctor about herbal medicines as doctors do not believe you if you tell them they are good.'' 73 ''I do not tell the doctor or pharmacist about herbal remedies as the doctor says why are you coming to us if you want to try different medicines.'' 77 ''I do not tell the doctor about herbal remedies taken as he is not bothered.'' 105 ''My doctor has said she would not advise mixing herbal medicines.'' 109 ''I do not tell my pharmacist as I never see one.'' 111 \"I do not tell the GP about herbal medicines I take as he might say do not take it.\" 113 ''The doctors do not believe in herbal remedies so why should I tell them what I use!'' 117 ''Doctor refuses the use of herbal medicines and says do not take them without our guidance.'' 124 ''Too scared to tell the doctor about any herbal medicines taken.'' 138 ''I rarely get to see my GP and do not ever see or speak to a pharmacist when I go to collect my medicines.'' 156 ''I do not tell my doctor or pharmacist about herbal medicines used as they do not recommend it.'' Several crucial reasons for not telling the doctor or pharmacist about personal use of HMs were identified. From the participants' responses (Table 2-8) it appears that participants thought HCPs lacked interest in HMs and were not concerned if they were consumed, as stated by participants 67, 77, and 113. If HCPs are not interested in their patients' use of HMs, then patients will feel reluctant to share this information with them (Staines, 2011). HCPs need to be broad-minded and approachable so that patients feel comfortable talking to them about their use of HMs (Newall et al., 1996; Vickers, 2000). Participants in this study claimed they would be advised to stop using HMs if they told their HCPs, as exemplified by the comments from participants 73, 117, and 156. An example of how taking HMs can affect patients' compliance with CWM and why HCPs may tell patients not to take HMs was demonstrated by Vohra (2015) who detailed the conversation between a pharmacist and a SA patient during a Medicines Use Review (MUR). During the MUR the patient explained to the pharmacist that he wanted to stop taking his antidepressant as he was taking a traditional Ayurvedic remedy instead; the pharmacist said, 'Conventional medicine has been clinically trialled and is proven to be effective; Ayurvedic preparations are unstandardised and have not gone through rigorous patient trials. They also have the potential to interact and potentially reduce the effectiveness of prescribed medicines.'' There are several reasons why 67 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra HCPs may tell their patients to stop taking HMs including: the risk of herb-drug interactions, adverse effects, reduced compliance with conventional therapy if patients take HMs, and most importantly the lack of scientific evidence to support the safety and efficacy of HMs (Fugh-Berman and Ernst, 2001; Edwards et al., 2012); this concept has been explored further in chapter 3. Evidently there was a fear of telling HCPs about HMs consumed as they may be regarded as inferior to CWM; as exemplified by participant 124 who said she was, ''Too scared to tell the doctor about any herbal medicines taken.'' Also participant 39 claimed, \"My son is a doctor and will not let me take anything herbal, as he says they are all rubbish, even if I know it is good for me.\" Dash and Kashyap (1980) documented that traditional medicine was considered to be substandard in comparison to Western medicine. Participants in this study revealed their anxiety of being treated differently or not treated at all if they exposed their use of HMs to their HCPs. While conducting the questionnaire with participant 2 she said, \"The doctor might refuse my treatment if he knew I was taking herbal medicines!\" Similarly participant 73 said, \"The doctor says why are you coming to us if you want to try different medicines.\" Language and cultural barriers which prevented participants from sharing information about their use of HMs with the HCPs were also identified by participants. Participant 122 was diagnosed with end stage liver cancer, and she revealed how the terrible effects of chemotherapy were relieved by the consumption of HMs, but she did not tell her consultants as she could not speak any English. Some concepts may be difficult to explain to Western HCPs; for example, there is no translation for bhye in English and so it is very difficult to explain this condition to Western HCPs. In turn, this may make people feel like HCPs do not understand their healthcare requirements. This was also reported by participants in the study conducted by Pieroni et al. (2010), which revealed that communication problems between Bangladeshis and HCPs in the UK prevented patients from using CWM appropriately. An interesting point raised by participants 109 and 138 was that they hardly saw their doctor or pharmacist and that is why they did not tell them about their use of HMs; they went on to say if they did see their HCPs, they would mention it. Participants mentioned that they got their prescriptions delivered so did not have any contact with their doctor or pharmacist. The increased popularity of repeat prescription services which are designed to save time for the patient, doctors surgeries, and pharmacies may not be entirely beneficial to patients if it means they do not get to see their HCPs. Ultimately, healthcare is a complex issue especially when combining different cultures and traditions. The results from this question have provided clear examples of why people do not tell their HCPs about the simultaneous use of HMs with CWM. Newall et al., (1996) claim that HMs are becoming more popular and 68 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra therefore HCPs should be aware of alternative therapies; in addition, patients should feel comfortable speaking to their HCPs about their use of HMs without feeling like they are being judged. Question 12 A: Do you notice any unwanted effects from your prescription medicines? 12 B: If Yes, what do you normally do to relieve the symptoms? From the 106 participants who took prescription medication, 43% (n=46) disclosed they had experienced unwanted effects from their medicines (Figure 2-24). Participant 85 claimed, ''Doctors tablets always give me side-effects.'' This was supported by participant 87 who said, ''When you take Western medicines expect more side-effects and tablets to follow.'' Effects such as nausea, diarrhoea, indigestion, cramp, insomnia and back pain were reported by participants; more serious problems such as diabetes and hypertension induced by medication were also noted (Table 2-9). For the relief of the side-effects the majority of participants (54%, n=57) revealed they would go back to see their doctor. Participant 29 stated, ''For side-effects from a tablet the doctor just gives another tablet.'' 31% (n=33) of participants who experienced unwanted effects said they would do nothing, while 15% (n=16) would try a herbal remedy. There was some mention of CWM being 'garam' thus causing many of the side-effects associated."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T11:04:39.519864Z","inner_id":23,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":24,"annotations":[{"id":25,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":1201,"end":1207,"text":"cancer","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"WwaAdcZZuQ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":6841,"end":6864,"text":"Hypericum perforatum L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"W1owJE06Uh","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7375,"end":7393,"text":"serotonin syndrome","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"akuYJD18Eb","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7767,"end":7773,"text":"gingko","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"qaDGNAmIfF","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-04-23T11:15:02.618513Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T11:15:02.618513Z","draft_created_at":"2024-04-23T11:06:05.809619Z","lead_time":617.64,"prediction":{"id":24,"model_version":"undefined","created_ago":"1 day, 1 hour","result":[],"score":null,"cluster":null,"neighbors":null,"mislabeling":0.0,"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.717992Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.717992Z","model":null,"model_run":null,"task":24,"project":1},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"d7114877-6311-4c05-8652-f85ce4d75aec","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":24,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":24,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"c35a5aa1-task_for_labelstudio_228197190_chunk_14.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[24],"data":{"text":"With the migration of people from around the world, they have brought with them their own medicines and remedies to the UK, something which HCPs should be aware of and have some insight into (Dogra et al., 2005). There are risks and benefits of consuming HMs which HCPs need to recognise, especially if their patients are consuming products which they consider to be natural and therefore safe (Ipsos MORI, 2008). HCPs are at the forefront of primary care and need to be well equipped with the correct knowledge and training on HMs. It is not feasible for HCPs to advise patients about HMs if the background knowledge is lacking (Pokladnikova and Lie, 2008). 3.4.4 Taking Herbal Medicines alongside Western Medicines There may be several reasons why people try or use HMs in addition to CWM, including: the traditional use of HMs passed through generations, dissatisfaction with CWM, a desire to take control of their own health by making their own decisions, and curiosity to try natural and holistic therapies (Doel and Segrott 2003; Clarke et al., 2004). Furthermore, people may use HMs when CWM do not appear to be working, or to treat and manage the side effects of CWM; this is commonly seen in cancer patients having chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Sawyer et al., 1994; Ernst and Cassileth, 1998). In developing countries the high cost of pharmaceutical medicines, hospitals and medical facilities means the use of HMs is popular, as they may be a cheaper alternative (WHO, 2000). However, in the UK where medicines and treatment is often free on the National Health Service (NHS) taking HMs may actually be more expensive. During the SATMED questionnaires distribution there were mixed views about taking HMs with regards to the financial cost; some participants said they were not interested in using HMs as they had to pay for them but got their prescription medicines for free. While others mentioned it was expensive to buy ingredients for HMs in the UK but it was cheaper to bring them back from countries like India and Pakistan. The import of HMs from foreign countries leads to further risks such as contamination, adulteration, and misidentification of species (Chapter 4). HCPs views of combining THM with CWM are more likely to be determined by evidence based research and clinical guidelines, rather than the test of time (Heinrich, 2015). Awodele et al. (2012) disclosed that 41% (n = 123) of respondents in their survey to explore doctors view of THM, thought THM were effective for treating chronic conditions; although, none 91 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra of the doctors believed that THM alone could treat a patient. A comparison of UK and German general practitioners (GPs) attitudes towards CAM was done by Schmidt et al. (2002); they found GPs from both countries generally had a positive attitude towards CAM, although the Germans were more positive. GPs from the UK commonly referred patients for acupuncture, osteopathy and chiropractic treatment; while, significantly more German GPs referred their patients to herbal medicines. In the UK there is limited research to explore what HCPs think about combining HMs with CWM; this is an area which needs to be investigated further. There is a growing concern of serious interactions occurring between HMs and prescribed or over-the-counter CWM (Vickers et al., 2006). Smallwood (2005) says there is a risk of people not taking their CWM correctly or as prescribed if they use HMs. Vickers et al. (2006) found participants did not think it was important to tell their doctors about their use of HMs as they did not think they interacted or affected one another. The Ipsos MORI report (2008) revealed that 66% of participants thought it was safe to take HMs at the same time as CWM. The notion that HMs are natural and therefore safe misleads people to think HMs are safe and free from deleterious effects (Howells, 1996; Staines, 2011). Eisenberg et al. (1998) claim 60-70% of CAM users do not discuss it with their doctors, meaning patients will not get the opportunity to learn about the potential risks and interactions of combining HMs and CWM (Schmidt et al., 2002; Graham et al., 2008). If HCPs are not aware that their patients are taking HMs alongside CWM they will not be able to intervene, or identify potential adverse effects and interactions (Heinrich, 2015). Furthermore, it may affect the appropriate pharmaceutical care plan from being implemented which may cause further complications to the patients' health (Ramsay et al., 2005). Potential Herb-Drug Interactions Polypharmacy is the term used to describe the simultaneous consumption of several medicines by one person (Duerden et al., 2013). Multiple medicines may need to be taken to control or treat health problems, in which case there is always the possibility for drug interactions to occur. The definition of a drug interaction is, \"when the effects of one drug are changed by the presence of another drug, herbal medicine, food, drink or by some environmental chemical agent,\" (Baxter, 2008). Dureden et al. (2013) highlights that polypharmacy can be harmful due to the increased risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and impaired medication adherence if prescribed too many medicines. For CWM before any drug is licensed for use it undergoes rigorous testing, providing evidence for its clinical use. Details of potential drug interactions are also documented in several sources such as the 92 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra British National Formulary (BNF) and Stockley's Drug Interactions, which HCPs have access to. Various studies have found between 20-33% of the population use some form of CAM either alone or in addition to CWM (Freymann et al., 2006). Polypharmacy with CWM alone can be hazardous; but, by adding HMs it could further complicate the consequences. A herb-drug interaction is when the effect of a drug is altered by herbal products. Herb-drug interactions are based on the same principles of pharmacokinetics (i.e. affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination) and pharmacodynamics (i.e. drugs effects are mimicked or antagonised) as with conventional drug interactions (Chavez et al., 2006). Cytochrome (CYP) P450 are a group of enzymes which metabolise a variety of substrates and have an important role in drug metabolism. Enzyme-inducing herbals render drugs ineffective at sub-therapeutic levels as they are metabolised too fast. Alternatively when herbal products inhibit or reduce the rate of enzyme activity drugs will be metabolised slower than anticipated; this can cause the drug to accumulate and cause toxicity. Drug accumulation can be a serious problem especially for drugs with a narrow therapeutic range, such as digoxin (Colalto, 2010). One of the most well-known herbal products which affects the CYP 3A4 isoenzyme, is St John's Wort (SJW) (Hypericum perforatum L.); it acts as an enzyme inducer which reduces the plasma concentration of certain drugs including carbamazepine (anti-epileptic), ciclosporin (immunosuppressant), statins and oral contraceptives (Komoroski et al., 2005; Graham et al., 2008). Hyperforin one of the active constituents in SJW induces P-glycoproteins in the intestinal wall reduces drug absorption. Furthermore, if taken with Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) a type of antidepressant such as citalopram or sertraline, it can cause serotonin syndrome; where the levels of serotonin become so high in the body that it can have fatal consequences (Chavez et al., 2006; Williamson et al., 2013). Fugh-Berman and Ernst, (2001) conducted a systematic review to explore the interactions between herbs and conventional drugs. They found that warfarin, a coumarin anti-coagulant, had the most interactions. Products such as garlic, gingko, ginseng, and even excessive consumption of green leafy vegetables can alter the anti-coagulant effects of warfarin (Chevallier, 2007). The mechanisms of how such interactions occur are not always understood or clinically significant; sometimes isolated reports of an interaction are the only indication of a potential interaction (Williamson et al., 2013). Warfarin is commonly initiated in patients who may have an increased risk of blood clotting, a history of a heart attack or stroke, or with prosthetic heart valves. It prevents the blood from clotting by inhibiting the conversion of hepatic vitamin K-dependent factors which reduce the amount of prothrombin produced; thus, reduces the rate of coagulation (Chavez et al., 2006). Foods which are high in vitamin K such as: cranberry juice, raisins, kiwi fruit, soya beans, 93 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra blackberries, blueberries, broccoli, and kale should be avoided by people taking warfarin (Fay, 2009). Despite being part of a healthy diet such products could affect the dose of warfarin required to have a therapeutic effect. It is very difficult to establish interactions between HMs and CWM as they are not frequently reported (Chavez et al., 2006). This may be because people who use HMs and HCPs lack the knowledge of herb-drug interactions (Vickers et al., 2006; Staines, 2011). In addition, if HCPs are not aware of patients taking HMs they cannot intervene or identify potential interactions (Heinrich, 2015). Communication between patients and their HCPs about HMs is vital to be able to identify potential herb-drug interactions and adverse effects from HMs (Vickers et al., 2006). The incidence of interactions between HMs and CWM is not fully known, and currently there is no way of establishing potential problems or clinical outcomes (Williamson et al., 2013). The main way of monitoring the safety of HMs is via the MHRA, which set up the yellow card scheme (Barnes, 2003; MHRA, 2014a). Publications such as Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions (Williamson et al., 2013) and Phytopharmacy - An Evidence Based Guide To Herbal Medicinal Products (Edwards et al., 2015) could be essential in educating HCPs about potential herb-drug interactions; however, unlike the BNF and Stockley's Drug Interactions such texts are not readily available for HCPs to access. 3.4.5 Using Social Media to Conduct Scientific Research The internet was made available to the public in 1991 with the introduction of the World Wide Web (WWW), which revolutionised how people learn, share information, and communicate (Vance et al., 2009). In the year 2000 just 26.8% of the UK population had access to the internet, in 2014 this had increased to 89.9% (Internet Live Stats, n.d). The launch of social media websites and applications such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and YouTube have increased the ease and speed of communication; social media may be used for social, leisure, or professional communications. An Ofcom report in 2013 estimated that 82% of the UK population aged over 16 had access to the internet, of which 53% used social media websites (Ofcom, 2013). For researchers this presents exciting opportunities to conduct research as it can be used as a valuable tool to identify and recruit participants (Beninger et al., 2014); which can lead to a snowball sample for exploratory work (Bhutta, 2012). With the rise in popularity and access to social media, Murphy et al. (2013) claim that researchers should look into new ways to engage respondents and capitalise on this evolving phenomenon. 94 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra State public health departments have also adopted the use of social media to share information and health promotion updates with the public (Thakeray et al., 2012), they have used Facebook and Twitter as a way of communicating with the general public and YouTube channels to help promote health awareness. The NHS UK has over 87 thousand followers on Twitter, while the Department of Health UK have over 161 thousand followers (Twitter, 2015); the followers were comprised of a mixture of HCPs and the general public. A study by Valdez et al. (2014) explored the benefits and challenges of recruiting for research studies related to consumer health information technology using Facebook. The study was composed of two phases which aimed to recruit specific populations: the first targeted a particular ethnic group (Filipino-American) and the second focused on type two diabetics. They posted messages on target groups and pages, and also sent private messages to administrators and people within the groups to recruit them for their research. They found that using social media structures such as Facebook was good for small samples providing qualitative data; but not so good for large samples for quantitative research. On the other hand, Bhutta (2012) used her personal Facebook networks and obtained over 4000 completed surveys for her research within one month. Valdez et al. (2014) highlight the importance of creating trust and transparency to successfully recruit participants. There are several advantages of conducting research using social media; it is a fast and efficient way of spreading a message, and getting instant feedback and replies (Sutton, 2010). Traditional methods of recruiting a sample can be time consuming and costly (Valdez et al., 2014). By using social media a large research sample can be recruited from different regions and even countries, allowing cross-cultural perspectives to be explored (Woodfield et al., 2013). It provides anonymity for participants who may not wish to disclose their personal details or identity, as they do not necessarily have to have any contact with the researchers (Beninger et al., 2014). In addition, as there is no facilitator present it eliminates the effects of researcher bias and may also give participants the freedom to express their views more open and honestly. It is cheaper than traditional research methods which may require printing and postage costs; in some cases it may even be free to set up an online survey. Once the research method, e.g. survey or focus group, is established it is easy to distribute the link to the survey and data can be collected quickly (Vance et al., 2009). There is an increasing number of people who have remote access to social media via multiple channels, e.g. smart mobile phones, netbooks, laptops, and tablets (Ofcom, 2013); therefore, online surveys can be completed quickly and instantly whilst on the go. Finally, as the data is collected electronically it reduces the risks of data input errors and is easier to analyse and store (Woodfield et al., 2013). 95 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra In spite of all the benefits of using social media to conduct research, there are also some disadvantages including: poor response rate, incomplete surveys, and the lack of control of the research population (i.e. cannot be sure of who is participating). This could be a particular problem if a specific research population is required but people who do not fall within the inclusion criteria participate. As the research is conducted without any face-to-face contact it may be difficult to keep participants engaged throughout the entire process. If participants do not understand a question there is no way of clarifying it, which may lead to unanswered questions or participants dropping out. The initial cost of some online research tools may be expensive, for example the basic survey on SurveyMonkey, an online survey development software, is free; however, this only enables a maximum of ten multiple choice questions and one hundred responses. In order to create a full survey where respondents can also write comments and unlimited responses can be collected it can cost from PS229 per year (SurveyMonkey, 2014). Considering that just over 50% of British adults use social media it would mean a significant portion of potential participants are not included in the research (Woodfield et al., 2013). One of the main drawbacks of this type of research is that because it is a fairly new concept it is difficult to apply traditional ethical principles to (Beninger et al., 2014). The Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (DTB) conducted some research to explore what HCPs knew about HMs using online surveys. They emailed 1,157 subscribers to the DTB and had a response rate of 14.2% (n=164). The limitations of this research were that they had a low response rate, it only targeted HCPs who had subscribed to the DTB, and was limited to mainly doctors and clinicians rather than a variety of HCPs; thus, limiting the generalisability of the results. Despite this they did uncover some interesting results (DTB, 2010). Using social media to conduct research provides a unique opportunity to engage a diverse range of people from around the world in a study, quickly and efficiently. Enabling researchers the freedom to explore concepts in an innovative way and people to share their thoughts and perspectives on a subject they are interested in (Woodfield et al., 2013). Traditional research methods have been tried and tested; their long standing use has been refined and guidelines to conduct ethical, safe, reliable and valid data are widely available. Conversely, the use of social media for conducting scientific research is a relatively new phenomenon; any new research done this was will help to highlight the benefits and drawbacks of this research method. Scientists should be willing to move with advances in technology instead of sticking to traditional methods (Murphy et al., 2013). 96 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.5 Methodology The following section details the research methods used to conduct this study; describing the design of the questionnaire, the participant inclusion criteria, how the survey was distributed, the ethical approval process, and how anonymity and confidentiality were maintained. 3.5.1 Questionnaire Design In order to explore HCPs opinions and knowledge of HMs a questionnaire to meet the aims and objectives of this investigation was constructed (Appendix 6); with a combination of open and closed questions to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data. It was designed to be an online, self-completion questionnaire, giving participants the flexibility to complete the survey in their own time (Moore, 2000). An introductory statement was created to advise participants on the purpose of the research and inclusion criteria (Appendix 7). Brent (2014) claims the more questions you ask the less time participants spend on each question. It was important to keep the questionnaire concise as it was anticipated that participants may be deterred from a lengthy survey."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T11:15:02.791212Z","inner_id":24,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":25,"annotations":[{"id":26,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":10583,"end":10600,"text":"Nigella sativa L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"qFaYckz2ut","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":10724,"end":10745,"text":"Ocimum tenuiflorum L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"NTOB3bYwKu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-04-23T11:21:56.308038Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T11:21:56.308038Z","draft_created_at":"2024-04-23T11:16:54.347966Z","lead_time":401.683,"prediction":{"id":25,"model_version":"undefined","created_ago":"1 day, 1 hour","result":[],"score":null,"cluster":null,"neighbors":null,"mislabeling":0.0,"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.717992Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.717992Z","model":null,"model_run":null,"task":25,"project":1},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"21203ac9-3a1b-42bf-aee8-8f85d2a7c3ce","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":25,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":25,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d64b95a1-task_for_labelstudio_228197190_chunk_15.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[25],"data":{"text":"For this reason there were only twenty questions split into four sections, estimated to be completed within 10-15 minutes. The first section set out to explore participants' personal use of HMs: looking into the traditional use of HMs amongst families and cultural backgrounds, and HCPs knowledge of HMs for specific ailments. The second section focused on patients' use of HMs, whereby HCPs experience of adverse effects and interactions caused by HMs were investigated. The third section looked at the HCPs' professional opinions of THM; exploring their perceptions of safety and efficacy of HMs, and opinions on the level of education on alternative therapies during their professional training. The final section was designed to evaluate the population demographics, exploring ethnic origins, gender, and occupations. 3.5.2 Participant Inclusion Criteria The definition of a HCP was explored in section 3.4.1 (p84). After considering the definitions of a HCP and receiving feedback from the De Montfort University (DMU) Ethics committee (Appendix 2A) it was concluded that the term healthcare professionals (HCPs) would be used to refer to those who currently have or previously had interactions with patients dealing with any aspect of patient care. This could include: doctors, consultants, surgeons, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, and physiotherapists, herbal medicine practitioners, etc. 97 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The principal requirement for the participant inclusion criteria was that participants had to be a HCP from the UK or having some experience of working in the UK; this was so the results could be generalised to UK HCPs. Undergraduate students currently completing degrees or courses were not directly invited to participate, if the students had training placements or contact with patients their responses were used for the analysis (e.g. pre-registration pharmacists or optometrists or students with clinical placements). There were no other defined parameters for the research sample (i.e. gender, age, or occupation), as this was an exploratory survey to investigate the general perceptions of HCPs on HMs. 3.5.3 Distribution of the Questionnaire Initially, it was intended that the questionnaire would be posted to HCPs, mainly doctors' surgeries and pharmacies around Birmingham and Leicester (the same cities where the SATMED questionnaires were conducted). However, this raised some doubt about the ethical approval required to send questionnaires to doctors who were contracted with the NHS (see section 3.5.4, p98). Also, the cost of printing and posting the questionnaires, the time consuming process, and low response rate associated with postal questionnaires were outweighing the benefits of conducting the research. The concept of using SurveyMonkey (an online survey software) and distributing it via social media was discussed amongst the research team and was considered to be a better alternative; as it avoided the cost of printing and posting the questionnaires. As the questionnaire was published online, distribution was not limited to two cities (Birmingham and Leicester); instead participants from across the UK were able to complete the survey. It was anticipated to be a quicker and easier way of distributing the survey to the target audience. The survey was available online for one year from 12th May 2014 -12th May 2015; this gave participants the freedom to complete the survey at their own leisure. The link to the online survey was emailed to friends and colleagues by the research team, participants were then asked to forward the email to other HCPs they knew. The link was circulated around Lloyds Pharmacy stores around the West Midlands with the approval of the area and regional managers. In addition, it was posted onto the researchers' personal Facebook and Twitter accounts, where friends who were HCPs were asked to complete the survey and share the link on their own profiles too. The link was re-tweeted (shared) by various HCPs and organisations on Twitter including The Guardian Healthcare. The distribution method used led to a snowball sampling technique being adopted as the survey was passed on from person to person. 98 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.5.4 The Ethical Debate To satisfy the De Montfort University (DMU) ethical guidelines, any changes to the original PhD proposal which required ethical approval needed to be declared to the DMU ethics committee and approved before the amendments were imposed. An amendment form was completed and submitted for review (Appendix 2A). The ethics committee highlighted several points which needed to be addressed (Appendix 2B). The main concern was the requirement of the National Health Service Research and Development (NHS R&D) approval for the study as it was going to explore the views of HCPs who worked for the NHS. Contact was made with the NHS R&D team at Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), who initially said the University ethical approval was sufficient for the online distribution of the questionnaires. If the questionnaires were to be posted to doctors surgeries then approval from local CCGs would need to be obtained. The ethical approval for the project was debated amongst the Leicester CCG as there were no guidelines for online surveys with HCPs. Governance Arrangements for Research Ethics Committees (GAfREC), published by the UK Health Departments in May 2011 states, \"Research Ethics Committee (REC) review is not normally required for research involving NHS or social care staff recruited as research participants by virtue of their professional role,\" (NHS Health Research Authority, n.d.). As the online surveys were to be completed by HCPs in their personal time some said NHS ethical approval was not required. Several correspondences later it was decided that the NHS R&D and Site Specific Information (SSI) forms needed to be completed via the Integrated Research Application System (IRAS) as the team at the Leicester CCG were collectively unsure about how to treat online surveys. SSI forms detail what activities will happen in precise locations and separate forms are required for each CCG; however, as the survey was distributed online the locality of the HCPs could not be forecasted. Despite this it was agreed to complete the process to ensure the study was conducted ethically. The time consuming application process was completed and ethical approval for the study was granted by the Leicester City CCG which provides the Primary Care R&D Service across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland (Appendix 2C). Beninger et al. (2014) identifies the difficulties of applying traditional ethical principles to newly developing methods such as online and social media research. Due to the limited guidance available it proved to be a challenge; but one where valuable lessons were learnt. 99 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.5.5 Anonymity and Confidentiality As no personal identifiable data was obtained participants anonymity was ensured throughout the process. The demographic data obtained at the end of the questionnaire was designed to evaluate the types of HCPs who were completing the questionnaire, their age, place of birth and ethnic background. No personal contact details were taken and there was no way of tracing where responses had come from. The survey was designed and published online via SurveyMonkey. It was a password protected website which only the primary researcher had access to, ensuring all responses were kept confidential. By having all the data password protected the researcher ensured there was no unauthorised access. 3.5.6 Analysis of the Questionnaires The SurveyMonkey software created graphs for quantitative questions, and enabled the results to be exported; summarising them into a portable document format (pdf) or PowerPoint presentation. Although this software enabled the data to be summarised it did not allow cross comparisons or correlations to be made. For this reason the results were then manually imported into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version 21), where they were analysed. 100 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.6 Results and Discussion A total of 112 respondents attempted the questionnaire, of which 93 were completed. Of the total number of participants who started the questionnaire, 19 withdrew at different stages; 11 participants stopped after question 3, 3 participants left after question 4, 1 stopped after question 9, and the other 3 participants left out the 'about you' section. It was contemplated to discard the incomplete surveys; however, this would mean losing some valuable data. For this reason all responses were included in the analysis and the number (n) of respondents for each question has been highlighted. 3.6.1 Sample Description The 'about you' section of the questionnaire was designed to get some background information about the research participants. As 19 participants withdrew by this stage of the survey, these results are from the 93 participants who completed the entire questionnaire. Age and Gender Profiles Figure 3-1 summarises the age and gender profile of the research sample: 57% (n=53) were female and 43% (n=40) were male participants. Most of the participants (n=33) were in the 21-30 years age group; nevertheless, there was a range of participants representing the other age groups too. The two participants in the '20 years or under' age group where both optometry students who had clinical placements; thus, their responses were included in this analysis. 051015202520 years orunder21-30 years 31-40 years 41-50 years 51-60 years 61+ yearsAge rangeNumber of participantsAge and Gender of ParticipantsMaleFemaleFigure 3-1 Healthcare Professionals' Age and Gender Profiles 101 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Ethnic Origins The two main ethnic groups participants identified with were White-British (39%, n=36) and Asian\/ Asian British-Indian (38%, n=35). Figure 3-2 identifies the proportion of participants from each ethnic background. The 7% (n=6) of participants who selected other claimed to be White-Italian, White-American, White-other, White-mixed, mixed White-British with Black-Caribbean, and Turkish. Figure 3-2 Healthcare Professionals' Ethnic Origins Birthplace & Religion The majority of participants (81%, n=75) were born in the UK, 8% (n=7) were born in India, 5% (n=5) in Africa and the remaining 6% (n=6) who selected 'other' said they were born in Albania, Australia, Ireland, Poland, or the USA. Some religions have a strong affiliation with HMs; for example black seed (Nigella sativa L.) is claimed to be the cure for all diseases but death according to Islamic beliefs (Ansari and Satish, 2013), while Tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) represents a goddess in Hinduism (Miller and Miller, 2003). There was a range of participants from each of the religious options presented; 25% Christian, 20% Hindu, 11% Sikh, 10% Muslim, 4% other (other religions listed included Buddhist, Jain, Jewish, and Humanist), while 30% (n=28) of participants claimed to have 'No Religion'. Participants were asked about their birthplace and religion to see if any correlation between their knowledge and use of THM was influenced by their background (this will be explored later in the results section). 39%4%5%1%38%5%1%7%Participants' EthnicityWhite: BritishWhite: IrishBlack\/ Black British: AfricanBlack\/ Black British: CaribbeanAsian\/ Asian British: IndianAsian\/ Asian British: PakistaniAsian\/ Asian British: BangladeshiOther102 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Highest Qualification There was a vast array of qualification listed by participants, including: GCSEs, A-Levels, diploma, bachelor's degree, postgraduate\/ clinical diplomas, Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS), Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS), Doctor of Medicine (MD), Masters, Master of Science (MSc), Master of Philosophy (MPhil), Master of Pharmacy (MPharm), Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD), Member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (MRCPsych), Bachelor of Medicine and\/or Surgery (MBBS), Member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (MRCOG), Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners MRCGP, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and post-doctorate (All Acronyms, 2015). A large number of participants (46%, n=43) had a Masters Level or equivalent qualification (Figure 3-3). Several pharmacists who had either an MPharm or bachelor's degree in pharmacy stated their highest level of qualification was their post-graduate\/clinical diplomas. Two participants selected the 'other' option, of which one stated 'professional' and the other 'Fellow of the Society of Biology.' The high level of qualifications participants have reflects the types of jobs they have, and the range of HCPs who completed this survey. Figure 3-3 Healthcare Professionals' Qualifications Job Role: Over 42 different occupations were listed by participants. Table 3-1 outlines the different job roles participants stated. It would not have been possible to recruit the variety of HCPs if traditional research methods such as postal questionnaires were used. If the surveys were posted to pharmacies and GP surgeries the responses would have been limited to community pharmacists, general practitioners, and practice nurses. Due to the survey being published online, it was easier to forward the link to a diverse range of HCPs. 0 10 20 30 40 50OtherPhD\/Doctorate or equivalentMasters or equivalentPost-graduate diplomaDegree or equivalentDiplomaA-LevelsGCSEsNumber of ParticipantsSummary of Qualifications 103 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 3-1 Summary of Healthcare Professionals' Occupations Key: (n = the number of participants identified under each profession). Do you currently work\/ have worked in the UK? This question was added due to concerns over the survey spreading internationally on social media, as the link was being rapidly circulated. Although the introductory paragraph before starting the questionnaire clearly stated 'for UK healthcare professionals' there was a risk of respondents not acknowledging this. As this question was added at a later date just 20 (22%) participants who completed the surveys responded; all of whom did confirm they currently did or had worked in the UK.

Question 1: Is traditional herbal medicine part of your family\/ cultural background? Of the total population who completed this question 45% (n=50) said HMs were part of their family\/ cultural background; while, 55% (n=62) said it was not. The demographics of the participants indicated they were from a range of ethnic backgrounds, religions, and countries. A comparison of participants' ethnic origins and whether or not they said HMs were part of their family\/cultural background revealed some interesting findings (Figure 3-4). More participants from the SA ethnicities (i.e. Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi backgrounds) claimed the use of HMs was part of their family and cultural background. Whereas, participants from Western cultures (i.e. White: British and Irish) stated HMs were not part of their family or cultural backgrounds. Figure 3-4 The Link Between Ethnicity and Traditional Remedies Being Part of Participants' Cultural Background. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used to see whether or not there was a statistically significant difference between ethnicity and the traditional use of HMs by participants' families. The Null hypothesis would be 'the traditional use of HMs is not linked with ethnicity'; while, the Alternative hypothesis would state 'the traditional use of HMs is associated with ethnicity.' If the significance (Sig) value is less than or equal to 0.05, there is a significant difference between the two variables (Pallant, 2007). The results from the 05101520253035Number of ParticipantsEthnicity Use of Traditional Herbal Remedies Amongst Different Ethnic Groups THR part of family\/cultural backgroundTHR not part of family\/cultural backgroundHMs part of fa ily\/ cultural background HMs not part of family\/ cultural background 105 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra ANOVA test gave a Sig value of 0.00 which is lower than 0.05 (Table 3-2); thus, a significant difference between the traditional use of HMs and ethnicity can be assumed. For this reason the null hypothesis can be rejected and the alternative hypothesis can be accepted, as a difference between the traditional use of HMs by families in different ethnic groups was statistically significant. Therefore, it can be concluded that the use of THM is associated with ethnicity.

The Ipsos MORI report (2008) stated those educated to a degree level or above were generally more likely to use HMs. From the qualifications listed by this research population it is clear participants were highly educated, 68% of participants had qualifications higher than a degree. Despite this, a large proportion of participants (62%, n=70) said they did not use any HMs for their own health. The 38% (n=42) of participants who did claim to use plants, herbs, or spices for their health listed a range of different products (Table 3-3)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-23T11:21:56.424606Z","inner_id":25,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":26,"annotations":[{"id":27,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":97,"end":106,"text":"Echinacea","labels":["Scientific

remedies for coughs and colds were listed including: honey and lemon, turmeric in milk, Echinacea, tulsi, ginger, and cinnamon. Mint, ginger, cardamom, and cumin were frequently mentioned for improving digestion. Various remedies for skin conditions such as aloe vera, turmeric, and neem were noted. For stress, anxiety and mild depression products such as St John's wort, valerian, and passion flower were documented. The most popular product mentioned was turmeric, cited by 45% of participants (n=19); its uses as an anti-inflammatory and antiseptic for skin infections and wound healing, coughs, colds, and immune boosting properties were detailed. Other products frequently cited included: ginger, cloves, mint, honey, lemon, aloe vera, and herbal sleeping aids. Some products such as fever grass, Sorrel Bitter herbs, nettle tea, and bush tea were identified by just a small number of participants. Similar to the results from question one, SA participants claimed to use HMs more than any of the other ethnic groups. The responses from participants of SA origin were compared to the other ethnic group participants, and a distinctive difference was seen. Most of the 106 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra products listed by SA participants included herbs and spices native to Asia such as ajwain, cardamom, and tulsi. Whereas products listed by the other ethnic groups were native to Western countries for example Agnus castus, camomile, Echinacea, nettles, and valerian. The most popular Western herbal product noted was Echinacea (Echinacea angustifolia DC.) which is native to North America (Chevallier, 2007). It has a long standing use in traditional medicine and has been considered as one of the most important medicinal herbs used to treat common cold and infections (Rezaie et al., 2013). Miller (2005) identifies it as \"one of the top-selling herbs of all time,\" as numerous commercial products in different pharmaceutical forms are available. The evidence supporting the use for Echinacea, as with most other herbal remedies, is variable (Miller, 2005).

Honey and lemon for colds. 35 Herbal sleeping tablets on occasion. 44 Very rarely. In conjunction with OTC medicines I may have used a small amount of ground turmeric in some milk to help with coughs and colds. 46 Turmeric for its antiseptic properties, sometimes with a hot chapatti (wholegrain wheat flour based) to act as a heated bandage for sprains. A mixture of chapatti flour and cold water to form a paste to apply on small burns. A mixture of turmeric and honey as a cleansing face mask. 48 Mint-for upset tummy, Turmeric as antiseptic. 107 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 49 Aloe Vera, Cerissie tea, Fever grass, Sorrel Bitter herbs, Ginger, Garlic, Bush tea. 50 Turmeric, Basil. 51 I use traditional Chinese herbs for cough related to Aspergillus in my lungs.

Provides rapid and effective relief in comparison to conventional medications. There is very little research which has explored UK based HCPs personal use of HMs. Generally research focuses on patients' use of HMs, concurrent use of HMs with CWM, or undergraduate students views of HMs (Heuschkel et al., 2002; Freymann et al., 2006; Smith, 2011). The results from this question reveal there are several factors which may influence HCPs decision to use HMs including: traditional use amongst ethnic and family backgrounds, perceived safety and efficacy, and clinical evidence to support the use of HMs. It was clear from some participants' feedback that evidence based medicine was crucial in influencing their decision to take HMs; due to the lack of clinical research to support the use of HMs, HCPs were often reluctant to use them for their own health. While other HCPs revealed the use of HMs has been part of their traditional heritage and the long standing use of HMs is sufficient evidence to support their use. Table 3-3 Summary of the Herbal Remedies Used by Healthcare Professionals Continued... 108 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 3: Would you prefer to use traditional herbal remedies over conventional Western medicine for minor health problems? E.g. cold\/constipation\/mild skin irritation? The results from this investigation found that 42% (n=47) of participants said they would prefer to use HMs for minor health problems rather than CWM. As reflected by participant 91, a pharmacist, who claimed that, \"using nature's remedies rather than synthetic, has fewer side effects and many more health benefits.\" Several references to HMs being natural and therefore safe were noted. In addition, participants claimed the use of HMs had been passed on through generations of the family and therefore they had tried them, when recommended by a family member. There was no correlation between the preference of using HMs with gender, or age; however, similar to previous questions participants from SA ethnic backgrounds generally preferred to use HMs for minor health problems more than other ethnic groups (Figure 3-5). Figure 3-5 Healthcare Professionals' Ethnicity and Preference to Use Herbal Remedies for Minor Ailments On the other hand, 58% (n=65) of participants claimed they did not prefer to use THM over CWM for minor health problem. The participants forming this research group were all HCPs who were specialists in various sectors of the healthcare framework. Their practice and education is evidence based and their distrust of HMs which lacked scientific validation was evident, as demonstrated by: participant 71 who stated, \"lack of controlled trial data and standardisation of preparations is a crucial weakness in the use of herbal medicines,\" and participant 100 who said, \"to be credible more patient and double blind trials need to take place.\" Other reasons for not favouring the use HMs for minor health problems included: distrust in natural remedies, the effects of HMs being compared to a placebo, suspicion of unregulated products, and uncertainty of what the HMs actually were (i.e. adulterated species). This was demonstrated by participant 60 who said, \"The difficulties with quality control (specifically in terms of dosage and active ingredients) make treatments with herbal remedies very much a gamble.\" 05101520253035White: British\/IrishBlack\/ BlackBritish: African\/CaribbeanAsian\/ AsianBritish: Indian\/Pakistani\/BangladeshiOtherNumber of ParticipantsEthnicity Ethnicity and Preference To Use Herbal Remedies For Minor Ailments Prefer toUse HerbalRemediesDo NotPrefer toUse HerbalRemedies109 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 4: Can you name any herbal remedies which can be used for the following conditions (arthritis, cough, diabetes, and indigestion)?-If so, please state what could be used. (Question 4 was answered by 101 participants) The four conditions selected for this question, arthritis, cough, diabetes, and indigestion, were also used in the SATMED questionnaire (Chapter 2); therefore, it was decided to use the same conditions in this survey. This question was designed to explore HCPs knowledge of HMs for common health problems treated in the UK (WHO 2006; PAGB, 2009; Arthritis Research UK, 2013a). In addition, similarities and differences between the SATMED participants and HCPs knowledge of HMs used for these conditions could be compared. Less than half of the participants (46%, n=46) did not state any HMs for the conditions listed; these participants either left the question blank or replied with answers such as 'no,' 'not sure,' or 'none are useful'. Research by the DTB found that doctors' knowledge about the clinical aspects of HMs and regulation was poor; of the HCPs who completed their survey 36.2% claimed their knowledge of HMs was 'quiet poor' while 10.4% said it was 'very poor' (DTB, 2010). The results from this survey could suggest that the 47% of HCPs who did not state any HMs in this question lacked the knowledge about the clinical benefits of HMs for the conditions stated. On the other hand, it may be argued that just because participants did not list any HMs does not mean they lack the knowledge, but instead they chose not to reply. The remaining 54% (n=55) of participants did attempt to state HMs for the conditions listed: 31% of the participants stated a HM for just one condition, 15% for two conditions, 24% for three conditions and 30% were able to recall a remedy for all four conditions (Table 3-4). Figure 3-6 illustrates the number of participants who recalled a herbal remedy for each of the conditions; cough (n=37) and indigestion (n=41) had more responses in comparison to arthritis (n=30) and diabetes (n=28). Cough and indigestion are amongst the top ten most common minor ailments treated by doctors and over-the-counter by pharmacists in the UK (PAGB, 2009), which could explain why more HCPs knew about HMs for these conditions in comparison to arthritis and diabetes.

Arthritis Research UK (2012) have acknowledged that sufferers will be tempted to try alternative therapies and have created a report based on randomised controlled trials which have tested the effectiveness and safety of some common HMs used for rheumatoid and osteoarthritis. It has summarised the safety and efficacy of several products including: fish oil, borage seed oil, evening primrose oil, Cat's claw, and flaxseed oil for rheumatoid arthritis; Indian frankincense, ginger, Devil's claw, willow bark, glucosamine, and chondroitin for osteoarthritis. Each product was given an efficacy score between 1-5 depending on the reported improvement in pain, movement, and general wellbeing; 1 correlated to no or very little evidence, while 5 represented data where there was consistent evidence across several studies. A traffic light system was used to code the safety profile, green represented minor\/ infrequent side-effects reported, amber signified commonly reported side-effects (even minor ones) or more serious effects, and red illustrated serious side effects reported. The full report is available for the general public to access to help make more informed decisions about herbal remedies to help with their condition (Arthritis Research UK, 2012). The most common HMs documented for arthritis by participants in this survey were: turmeric, glucosamine, ginger, Devils' claw, cod liver oil, rosehip, apple cider vinegar, and willow bark (Table 3-4). Many of these remedies were similar to those listed in the Arthritis Research UK (2012) report 'Complementary and alternative medicines for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia.' Several remedies such as turmeric, ginger, and sesame seed oil were similar to responses listed by the SATMED survey participants. The key difference noted was that the participants in this survey mentioned products such as glucosamine, rosehip, Boswellia and willow bark, which none of the SATMED participants identified. Boswellia (also known as Indian frankincense, Boswellia serrate Roxb. ex Colebr.) is famous for its use in the traditional Indian medical system of Ayurveda (Siddiqui, 2011). The resin from the trees has an anti-inflammatory action as it is rich in mono\/di\/tri-terpenes and pentacyclic triterpenic acids i.e. b-boswellic acid which inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes (Sontakke et al., 2007). Research by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (2014) found that common ailments such as coughs and colds cost the NHS PS1.1 billion a year, when patients are treated by their GPs or Accident and Emergency. The HMs mentioned for cough included turmeric, tulsi, honey (with or without lemon, black pepper, ginger, in hot water), and liquorice. HMs such as poppy, squill, coltsfoot, mallow, and thyme were mentioned specifically by White-British\/ Irish participants. Mallow (Marshmallow, Althaea officinalis L.) is a traditional European herb; that has demulcent properties which help sooth a cough (Chevallier, 2007)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T08:15:57.142479Z","inner_id":26,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":27,"annotations":[{"id":28,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":109,"end":114,"text":"cough","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_0","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":664,"end":669,"text":"cough","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_1","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":756,"end":761,"text":"cough","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":977,"end":988,"text":"indigestion","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":1120,"end":1131,"text":"indigestion","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_5","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":1267,"end":1278,"text":"indigestion","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":1372,"end":1383,"text":"indigestion","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":1994,"end":2002,"text":"diabetes","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_11","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":2286,"end":2294,"text":"diabetes","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_13","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":2324,"end":2332,"text":"diabetes","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_14","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":3039,"end":3059,"text":"Tussilago farfara L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"entity_15","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":3074,"end":3090,"text":"Urtica diocia L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"entity_16","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":3535,"end":3544,"text":"arthritis","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_17","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":3546,"end":3551,"text":"cough","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_18","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":3553,"end":3561,"text":"diabetes","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_19","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":3567,"end":3578,"text":"indigestion","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_20","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":10763,"end":10789,"text":"Piper methysticum G.Frost.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"entity_21","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":1094,"end":1099,"text":"senna","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"JhsUHOx0D7","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1193,"end":1205,"text":"constipation","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"NaZu3YmH5_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1170,"end":1188,"text":"stimulant laxative","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"V3C8v3AiKI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1362,"end":1367,"text":"senna","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"1H_LXi19Vt","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2037,"end":2046,"text":"aloe vera","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"K9XWJtmRV3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2157,"end":2196,"text":"Gymnema Sylvestre (Retz.)

It is marketed as a traditional herbal medicine as the evidence for its efficacy was based on its traditional use. The development, marketing, and success of new HMs suggests consumers are interested in trying natural remedies; as implied by the sales figures of Bronchostop which were reported to the value of PS4.36 million since being launched in 2014 (OTC bulletin, February 2015). Those participants who did not support the use of HMs for the treatment of cough made references to HMs having a placebo effect or not having any effect on treating a cough at all, like participant 62 who claimed that, \"none are useful (neither are any conventional medicines),\" while, participant 51 stated she only used medicines \"on prescription from my practitioner\" for a cough. For indigestion peppermint, fennel, mint, aniseed, and ajwain were the most popular HMs mentioned. Participant 85 listed senna as being useful for indigestion; however, it is licensed for use as a stimulant laxative for constipation, which can cause abdominal cramping as a side-effect, making indigestion feel worse (Chevallier, 2007). Although there is no evidence to support the use of senna for indigestion it may be something the participant tried and found useful. WHO (2006) estimated that in 2000, 171 million people around the world had diabetes and they predicted it would more than double by 2030 to 366 million people; however, in 2014 an estimated 422 million adults were living with diabetes (WHO, 2016). There are currently 3.3 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the UK, a condition which can affect any age, cannot be cured, and in most cases requires medical treatment (Diabetes UK, 2015). Diabetes can have serious health consequences if not managed correctly. The most popular HMs mentioned for diabetes were karela, cinnamon, fenugreek, aloe vera, and okra. Other products listed by the HCPs included bilberry, black seed, sweet potato, and gurmar. Gurmar (Gymnema Sylvestre (Retz.) R. Br. ex Sm.) in Hindi translates to 'destroyer of sugar' and it has been used traditionally to treat diabetes and symptoms associated with diabetes such as urinary frequency (Saneja et al., 2010). Many similarities between the products\/ HMs recalled in this survey and the SATMED questionnaire were noted; i.e. turmeric, ginger, tulsi, garlic, mint, and aniseed were mentioned frequently by participants in both surveys. Whereas, products such as rosehip, Marshmallow, willow bark and Devil's claw were only identified by participants in the HCPs survey. Unlike the SATMED questionnaire which was for SA participants only, this survey was open to participants from all ethnicities which has enabled more varied responses to be collected. Participants from the non SA ethnic groups listed more Western herbals such 113 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra as coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara L.) and nettles (Urtica diocia L.) which are native to Europe (Chevallier, 2007). A difference in knowledge of HMs was also identified between the ethnic groups, as more SA participants (n=28) were able to list HMs for the conditions than White British\/ Irish participants (n=13); this suggests that SA HCPs had more knowledge of HMs for the conditions listed compared to HCPs from other ethnicities. Overall the results from question 4 have revealed a diverse range of HMs for arthritis, cough, diabetes, and indigestion known by the HCPs (Table 3-4), exemplifying the wealth of knowledge HCPs possess. 3.6.3 Patients' Use of Herbal Medicines This section of the survey tried to establish whether or not patients reported their use of HMs to their HCPs, how often HCPs came across patients using THM, and HCPs experience and knowledge of adverse effects and interaction caused by the consumption of HMs. This analysis represents the results of 98 participants who completed this section. Question 5: Do you currently have contact with patients? This question was added shortly after the survey was launched; as after reviewing the initial responses it was decided to assess whether or not HCPs were actually dealing with patients. This was to determine how many of the respondents were actively practicing their profession. As the question was added later, 11 participants had missed the question. Of those who did complete the question 91% (n=79) said they were in contact with patients, while just 9% (n=8) were not. Participants who were not in contact with patients were generally working in academia, research, or retired; they completed the survey based on their previous experience while working with patients. In addition, some HCPs no longer had regular contact with patients but were involved in different aspects of patient care for example superintendent pharmacists responsible for the overall management of professional services across pharmacies. Question 6: Do your patients tell you about any herbal medicines they use? As many as 52% of patients in the UK have tried some form of complementary therapy at some point, with HMs reported as the most common form used (Posadzki et al., 2012). One third of HCPs (33%, n=32) who answered this question said their patients did not tell them 114 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra about any HMs they used. A small number of participants (2%, n=2) selected the 'not applicable' option as they did not have contact with patients, so could not answer the question. Newall et al. (1996) claims that doctors are becoming increasingly aware of their patients' use of HMs. This is supported by the results of this survey which revealed that 65% (n=64) of HCPs said their patients did tell them about their use of HMs. Practitioners of CWM have not always accepted the use of HMs; however, there appears to be a change in the attitude of Western HCPs to complementary therapies (Vickers, 2000). In order to build trust with patients, so patients feel comfortable telling HCPs about their use of HMs, HCPs must keep an open mind and be approachable (GMC, 2009). Vickers (1994) identified that there is an increasing use of complementary therapies across Europe, and doctors should routinely include questions about complementary therapies when taking a patients history. Upon reflection of this survey, a question about whether or not HCPs asked patients about their use of HMs should have been included; to see if HCPs were proactive in finding out about their patients' use of HMs. Heuschkel et al. (2002) looked at the use of HMs in children and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease and found that just 8% of doctors initiated a discussion about CAM. If patients do not tell their HCPs about their use of HMs it can have serious consequences, such as patients delaying seeking medical attention which could exacerbate their condition (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). HCPs should be encouraged to routinely ask patients about their use of HMs (Heuschkel et al., 2002). Question 7: How often do you come across patients who take herbal medicines alongside their prescription medicines? When the initial version of the questionnaire was submitted for review to the DMU ethics committee this question was created using the likert scale: 'Very Frequently, Frequently, Occasionally, Rarely, Never.' The ethics panel review of the questionnaire led them to ask, 'how frequently is frequently?' They suggested modifying the scale to justify the frequency of reporting; thus the terms 'Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annually, and Never' were used. Figure 3-7 reveals that most HCPs did come across patients who were using HMs alongside their prescription medication. Very few HCPs (3%, n=3) claimed they met patients who told them about their use of HMs daily (this would be equal to the 'very frequent' option on the original likert scale).The majority of HCPs (35%, n=34) said patients reported their use of HMs 'monthly', an equal proportion (22%, n=22) selected 'weekly' or 'annually'. Those HCPs who disclosed that patients never reported their use of HMs (17%, n=17), most worked in academia or research, some were pharmacists in managerial or office based roles (i.e. chief or clinical research pharmacists), optometry students, and a dentist. 115 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Figure 3-7 Frequency of Patients Reporting their Use of Herbal Medicines to HCPs De Smet et al. (1997) claim patients may feel reluctant to tell their HCPs about their use of HMs; this was also observed in the results from the SATMED questionnaire, where participants did not want to tell their HCPs about their use of THM. The SATMED questionnaire participants revealed they were scared of being treated differently or judged by their HCPs. HCPs have the opportunity to build a relationship and trust with their patients. During consultations if patients feel they can trust their HCP they may feel more inclined to disclose their use of HMs. Patients may not think that reporting their use of HMs is important, due to the common misconception that, 'herbal remedies are natural and therefore safe' (Ipsos MORI, 2008; Shaw et al., 2012). In some situations, such as before surgery, it is vital for HCPs to know whether or not patients take HMs as there could be complications if not disclosed (Ang-Lee et al., 2001). Overall, the results from this question suggest that more HCPs claimed that they were informed about their patients' use of HMs than those who were not. Question 8: Have you encountered any adverse effects caused by the consumption of herbal medicines? Adverse effects from HMs could be anything from a minor side-effect, such as local irritation from using witch hazel for skin conditions, to life threatening reactions like cancer or hepatotoxicity caused by comfrey (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013); 31% (n=30) of HCPs in this survey claimed to have encountered an adverse drug reaction (ADR) associated with HMs (Table 3-5). An example of a serious herbal-ADR caused by the consumption of garlic supplements was identified by participant 15, an anaesthetic registrar, whereby the patient had impaired blood coagulation which caused severe blood loss during surgery. It has been suggested that garlic can have an anti-platelet effect similar to that of low-dose aspirin; therefore, if taken with other blood thinning drugs there is an increased risk of bleeding 05101520253035Daily Weekly Monthly Annually NeverNumber of participantsFrequency of Patients Reporting their Use of Herbal Medicines to HCPs116 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra (Williamson et al., 2013). Participant 22 (a medicines information pharmacist) recalled a patient with deranged liver functions after taking Kava kava (Piper methysticum G.Frost. ); a product which is now prohibited in the UK and many other countries due to the fatal hepatotoxic effects associated with its use (Mann and Andrews, 2007). In 2006, 79 reports of liver damage associated with the use of Kava were reported to the MHRA (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013), which eventually led to it being banned in the UK. There are several well documented adverse effects caused by the consumption of HMs, including: heartburn caused by peppermint, hypoglycaemia caused by karela or fenugreek, and renal failure or cancer caused by Aristolochia species (Newall et al., 1996; Shaw, 2010). Although peppermint is considered to be a HM it is one of the few products prescribed by UK HCPs for abdominal colic or irritable bowel syndrome (BNF July, 2015). As it is regulated and its efficacy has been clinically tested, the ADRs associated with its use are well known i.e. as it's an irritant it can cause hypersensitivity reactions such as headache, bradycardia, and muscle tremor (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). However, with most other HMs there is limited knowledge and information available on the ADRs associated with their use, making it imperative to conduct more research on the safety and efficacy of HMs. Shaw (2010) claims that adverse effects from HMs may be due to the unregulated use of HMs, poor quality of herbals, adulterated or contaminated herbs, or the wrong or misidentified herbs being used. Participant 59 also listed several reasons why patients may experience adverse effects after consuming HMs, such as \"contaminated products due to poor quality controls\" and \"adverse synergistic effects with existing prescription drugs.\" Several references to ADRs caused by Chinese herbal medicines which contain steroid contamination were also noted by participants 49, 72 and 109. Pharmacovigilance involves monitoring drug safety and adverse effects. WHO (2015) defines pharmacovigilance as, \"science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problem.\" It begins during clinical trials and continues once the drug is available on the market (Sarker et al., 2015). Although, it is focused on conventional medicines the same principles can be applied to HMs (Barnes, 2003). The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) established the 'yellow card scheme' (YCS) to monitor the safety of all healthcare products in the UK, including HMs (MHRA, 2014a). Until 1996 the YCS only collected ADR information on licensed HMs; however, in October 1996 this was changed to include all HMs (Mann and Andrews, 2007). Shaw et al. (2012) claims that as the use of HMs has increased, the reports of adverse effects should have also risen; despite this, the number of reports remains low (Barnes, 2003). This was also found in the results of this survey 117 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra whereby 69% (n=68) of HCPs said they had not come across any adverse effects caused by the consumption of HMs. In 2001, 70 reports of herbal-ADRs were received by the MHRA, this formed just 0.4% of the total number or reports received in 2001 (Mann and Andrews, 2007). The latest MHRA Annual Report and Accounts 2014\/15 reveals that 14,836 ADRs were reported, a 12.5% increase in the last three years; however, it does not specify the number of herbal-ADRs reported (MHRA, 2014b). The Herbal Medicines Advisory Committee Annual Reports 2014 identified that 51 reports of ADRs from herbal medicinal products (excluding food, cosmetics, and homeopathic products) were received via the YCS in 2014 (MHRA, 2014c). Unlike CWM which have undergone clinical trials and extensive research to document their safety and efficacy profiles, often the only evidence for the safety and efficacy of HMs is their long standing use throughout history (De Smet et al., 1997). Traditional knowledge of HMs is not well documented, let alone the adverse effects which may be associated. In addition, peoples' lack of knowledge of the adverse effects caused by HMs could have an important role in the severe underreporting of adverse reactions caused by HMs. Educating the public about potential herbal-ADRs caused by HMs could help people use them safely and reinforce the importance of reporting via the YCS (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). The need to improve pharmacovigilance of HMs to ensure people use them safely is of paramount importance (Barnes et al., 1998). 118 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 3-5 Adverse Effects Encountered From Patients Taking Herbal Medicines Participant Number: Adverse Effects From Taking Traditional Herbal Remedies: 2 Loose stools, digestive problems, nausea, dizziness, raised liver enzymes. 15 Impaired coagulation leading to excess blood loss at surgery - patient taking garlic supplements. Excess liquorice consumption has been reported to cause malignant hypertension. 20 Hypoglycaemia with karela. 22 Deranged liver function with Kava kava. Collapse with multi-constituent product. Organ failure in baby from unidentified Asian medicine ....to name a few. 33 When I worked in Oncology there were a number of occasions when ladies being treated with trastuzumab for breast cancer asked about whether there was a problem if they were taking a herbal product. The answer was always possibly and in one case the patient taking Hypericum had her dose delayed until she had stopped taking it. 36 Renal impairment. 44 A number of years ago, i was informed by a colleague of a patient who had been admitted with liver impairment thought to be caused by an Indian herbal remedy. 49 Only Chinese herbal medicines that have potent steroids in. 56 Not so much herbal but a patient using green vegetable juices for cancer; but, also taking warfarin and ended up with nose bleeds. 57 Digestion issues. 59 Many adverse reactions due to: a) contaminated products due to poor quality controls b) deliberately adulterated products to give an effect c) adverse synergistic effects with existing prescription drugs d) side effects of herbal medicines. 60 Malignant Neuroleptic Syndrome. Serotonergic Syndrome. 61 Liver damage due to use of TCM herbal remedy for eczema. 62 Many side effects have been described in literature and in MHRA warnings. 72 Renal failure after use of an aphrodisiac steroids in skin cream leading to skin thinning. 75 Severe GI bleed resulting in prolonged ICU admission, herbal medicine was for memory (not exactly sure as it has been some time since) but was not gingko. 79 Use of garlic. 82 Unsure whether traditional remedies were the causative item but dramatic increase in blood pressure for heart failure patient when taking both traditional and Western medicines , but this was about 10 years ago. 100 Urticaria. 109 Many years ago a patient taking a Chinese tea remedy which had steroids in it. 119 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 9: Are you

a third of participants (37%, n=36) said they did not know of any interactions between HMs and CWM; while, the majority of participants (63%, n=62) said they were aware of interactions. Those participants who said they knew of interactions between HMs and CWM, 56% (n=55) named at least one interaction (Table 3-6). The most common herbal product known to interact, described by 37% (n=33) of participants, was St Johns Wort (SJW). SJW is one of the most well-known herbal remedies which has been used to treat mild depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, seasonal affective disorder, toothache, pain, gastritis, stomach ulcers, and aid local wound healing (Chevallier, 2007). Due to the numerous interactions with CWM it has been extensively researched. There are several active constituents in SJW responsible for its diverse medical uses including flavonoids, hypericin, and hyperforin (Williamson et al., 2013). SJW is known to affect a number of the cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes which accounts for the range of interactions associated with it. It has an enzyme inducing effect on the CYP 3A4, CYP 219 and CYP 2E1 isoenzymes. The role of these isoenzymes on drug distribution and metabolism is speeded up rendering other drugs less or ineffective; this causes SJW to interact with drugs such as anti-epileptics (carbamazepine and phenytoin), contraceptive pills, ciclosporin, theophylline, antidepressants - monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and warfarin (Henderson et al., 2002; Williamson et al., 2013). SJW can also affect the transporter protein P-glycoprotein, which has an essential role in drug absorption from the intestine, and distribution, acting as a drug efflux pump (Gurley et al., 2008). One of the main drugs affected by this mechanism is digoxin, a drug which has a narrow therapeutic index; therefore, small variations in blood concentrations can lead to toxicity or a sub therapeutic dose (Currie et al., 2011). There are several studies which demonstrate that the induction of the P-glycoprotein in the intestine by SJW leads to reduced absorption of digoxin (Hennessy et al., 2002); hence reducing the concentration of digoxin in the blood rendering the drug ineffective. Other drugs affected by this include ciclosporin and fexofenadine (Gurley et al., 2008). Participants also mentioned the interactions between warfarin and several herbal remedies such as ginseng, gingko, garlic, and cranberry juice. It has been reported that these substances can impair platelet aggregation, therefore effect blood coagulation. The International Normalised Ratio (INR) is a measure of the blood coagulation, which should be between 2-3 depending on the condition for which warfarin is initiated (BNF, 2015). A high INR means the blood is thinner so takes longer to clot, increasing the risk of bleeding; while a low INR means the blood clots too quickly. As these HMs reduce platelet aggregation, if 120 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra taken with warfarin they can also increase the risk of bleeding. One study claimed that ginseng reduced the effectiveness of warfarin; however, the pharmacological mechanism remains unclear (Yuan et al., 2004). Reports that cranberry juice inhibited the metabolism of warfarin therefore reducing its clearance from the body and increasing its effects were documented by the Committee of Safety of Medicines \/MHRA when several incidents of increased INR and bleeding were reported (CSM\/MHRA 2003). A study in the UK which looked at the pharmaceutical care plans of 631 patients in an outpatient anticoagulant clinic found that 170 patients were using some form of HM at the same time as taking warfarin; of these patients 58% were taking something which could potentially interact with warfarin. The authors concluded that by taking a full drug history from patients, potential interactions between HMs and warfarin could be avoided (Ramsay et al., 2005). Fugh-Berman and Ernst (2001) say those taking anticoagulants especially coumarins should generally be advised to avoid taking any HMs. As the practice of polypharmacy, whereby multiple drugs are consumed concurrently is becoming more common (Edwards et al., 2012), the risk of interactions between HMs and CWM needs to be considered. Furthermore, HCPs need to be more aware about potential interactions which could affect their patients' health. Although there are some valuable texts which summarise herb-drug interactions published (e.g. Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions - Williamson et al., 2013), such books are not readily available to HCPs. As identified by participants 20, 59, and 67 there are a variety of sources available to determine herb-drug interactions; however due to the lack of research on many HMs there may be limited evidence available to inform and guide HCPs. 121 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 3-6 Interactions between Herbal and Conventional Western Medicines Identified by Healthcare Professionals Participant Number: Interactions between Traditional Herbal Medicines and Conventional Western Medicines: 2 St John's wort with contraceptives and anti-depressants (SSRI's and MAOI's).

Table 3-6 Interactions between Herbal and Conventional Western Medicines Identified by Healthcare Professionals Continued... 123 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 3.6.4 Professional Opinions of Herbal Medicines The final part of the questionnaire aimed to investigate HCPs professional opinions on the safety and efficacy of HMs. The literature search around this topic revealed that there was limited information available about how much information is passed on to undergraduate HCPs during their courses (Smith, 2011); for this reason participants were asked whether or not they received sufficient education on HMs during their training. This section was completed by 96 participants. Question 10: Do you think the use of plants, herbs and spices is effective to prevent or treat various health conditions? Two thirds of the participants (66%, n=63) said they thought HMs were effective. Participants commented on how the long standing use of HMs throughout history was an important factor in determining the efficacy of HMs; as demonstrated by participant 42 (a pharmacist) who stated, \"Pharmacy is generally sceptical about the use of traditional herbal medicines because of lack of scientific studies but, in my opinion, traditional herbal medicines can be very effective in non-Western countries where there is a tradition for this. If something has been used for centuries and works then it works.\" In addition, participant 36 (a consultant physician) claimed, \"I am sure that there is some evidence of benefit (even if placebo effect) for some herbal medicines - but I do not see them as a replacement for conventional medicine.\" Despite the limited evidence to support the health claims associated with HMs the transmission of this knowledge throughout time has been used an indicator for the efficacy of HMs. The remaining third of participants (34%, n=33) who did not think HMs were effective or any better than a placebo, made comments regarding the lack of evidence to prove the efficacy of HMs. The emphasis on the lack of reliable scientific evidence to support the use of HMs, was illustrated by participant 62 who said, \"If you look at NCCAM's herbs at a glance (http:\/\/nccam.nih.gov\/health\/herbsataglance.htm) you will see that there is not a single herbal preparation for which there is good evidence for efficacy, even according to this pro- CAM organisation. They originated in a time when anecdote rather than proper testing sufficed; there is no excuse for pharmacies selling things that are either unproven or disproved.\" Although there were mixed reviews about the effectiveness of HMs, some participants suggested that HMs were used to supplement CWM, especially in patients with cancer and HIV. Participant 63 (a GP) said, \"Western medicine alone is not enough to treat someone 124 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra holistically. Additional approaches are required, including herbal medicines and complementary therapies e.g. art therapy, hypnotherapy. Many issues are stress related or exacerbated by stress and these unfortunately are not dealt with adequately.\" This is supported by findings from Awodele et al. (2012) who uncovered that 41% (n=123) of participants in their survey of Nigerian HCPs thought that HMs were effective for chronic conditions; although none thought that HMs alone could be used to treat a patient. Subscribers to the DTB were asked to complete a survey about HMs, of the 164 respondents who were asked if they thought HMs were helpful: 22.2% (n=36) said 'rarely or never' while 75.3% (n=122) said HMs were helpful 'in some circumstances' (DTB, 2010). It is well known that many of the HMs used are based on their traditional reputation rather than clinical evidence (Newall et al., 1996). In addition, many HMs may be used in their crude form, rather than in pharmaceutical formulations making it difficult to determine the safety and efficacy of HMs due to the vast range of formulations and irregular doses. The emphasis on evidence based medicines requires validated scientific evidence including randomised controlled trials which prove the efficacy of drugs; however, this information is not available for most HMs (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). More research on HMs is now being conducted to validate the efficacy of HMs. For example, the wealth of literature available on SJW which has provided useful evidence to support the traditional health claims associated with its use. The vast amount of information available on SJW has even led some people to question whether it is still considered a HM or a CWM as stated by participant 82, \"depends if St John's wort is classed as traditional or not!\" The results for question 10 demonstrate the different views HCPs had regarding the efficacy of HMs. A larger number of participants agreed that HMs were effective for some health conditions; however, there were still some reservations regarding the perceived efficacy of HMs due to the lack of clinical data to support their use. Question 11: Do you think the use of plants, herbs and spices is safe? One of the reasons for the popularity of HMs is the belief that they are natural and therefore safe (Shaw et al., 2012); similar views were shared by 58% (n=56) of participants in this survey who thought HMs were safe. Participant 42 (a pharmacist) who agreed HMs were safe stated, \"conventional Western medicines are just as harmful as traditional herbal medicines if used improperly and in excess.\" On the other hand, 42% (n=40) of HCPs did not agree that HMs were safe. Some participants stated that HMs may be more dangerous than CWM due to the lack of evidence to support their use. Various reasons participants felt 125 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra HMs were not safe included the lack of clinical evidence to support their use, the lack of regulation of HMs, and problems of quality and contamination. Several participants commented on the need for proper regulation to be able to determine the safety of HMs. Participant 36 (a consultant physician) said, \"Whilst only a small amount of harms are caused - I cannot call them safe because in some instances they are not. I think that all in all more regulation is needed and then I would consider the patient's views in taking a cautious approach to use of herbal remedies in some conditions,\" and participant 44 (a pharmacist) who noted, \"Traditional herbal medicines need to be regulated better, I have seen recent reports of hazardous contaminants.\" An interesting statement was made by participant 15 (an anaesthesia registrar) who claimed, \"It's more complex than whether they're safe or not - it depends on the dose, what other medication the patient is on & the interaction between them (if any). Often, herbal products have inconsistent concentrations between batches & therefore the true dose is never known. There have been instances of additives not listed on packaging also being included in the product - I feel generally these products are an unknown quantity because the contents, concentration & production methods are subject to much lower standards of scrutiny than tablets. They are drugs just as much as tablets are, the 'herbal' label lulls people into thinking there are no possible side effects - this is not true, nor is it safe.\" This reiterates that there are numerous factors which can affect the safety of HMs including: the dose (high doses may cause toxicity), co-morbidities (taking HMs while taking CWM increases the risk of interactions), time of use (before surgery could impair blood coagulation or cause complications, during pregnancy or lactation could affect the baby), adulteration (the wrong species selected), or contamination (heavy metals or other active constituents) (Upton and Romm, 2012). Furthermore, participant 59 stated, \"For most conditions, herbal medicine is unnecessary, ineffective and the risk of interactions with pharmaceutical drugs too high to recommend using them for any condition. Contamination (accidental, natural and deliberate) means their safety will always be in question.\""},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T08:43:42.966186Z","inner_id":28,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":29,"annotations":[{"id":30,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":328,"end":340,"text":"aristolochia","labels":["Scientific

herbal products are now prohibited or have restricted use in the UK due to the safety concerns associated with them. The MHRA document 'Banned and restricted herbal ingredients' updated in December 2014, lists all the products which are subject to restrictions in the UK. It includes completely restricted products such as aristolochia, Kava-kava, and aconite (Aconitum species) traditionally used for poison arrows. Other products which can only be prescribed by a registered doctor or dentist include: foxglove (Digitalis purpurea L.) and opium (Papaver somniferum L.). Some products can only be purchased from a registered pharmacy under the supervision of a pharmacist such as, Mistletoe berry (Viscum album L.) and Belladonna (Atropa belladonna L.) (MHRA, 2014d). Before 126 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra concerns of the risks, adverse effects, and fatalities were recognised some of these products were widely available; but, over time as more reports documented the risks associated with them, they were withdrawn from the market. All drugs which have a marketing authorisation have to undergo extensive research to validate the risks and benefits of treatment; whereas, HMs may be consumed without any clinical research to support their use. The fact that HMs have been used for hundreds of years does not suggest they are safe (Barnes et al., 1998). Herbal products known to cause adverse effects or which may be harmful can be avoided; however, this information may not always be known and the long term implications remain to be uncovered. The risks of herb-drug interactions can affect the efficacy of conventional medicines which may threaten the pharmaceutical care of patients (Pharmaceutical Press, 2013). Participants in this survey also made reference to the fact that HMs were harmful as their patients were more reluctant to take CWM if they were taking HMs, making health problems worse and more difficult to manage once they had exacerbated. There were several concerns raised over the safety of HMs; nevertheless, with better information sharing between patients and their HCPs, reporting of ADRs, and more research on HMs the safety profiles for herbal products can be better understood. Question 12: Would you ever recommend herbal medicines to your patients? Various reasons for not recommending HMs to patients were identified by 65% (n=62) of participants, including: participant 51 (an independent public health specialist) who said he would not recommend HMs, \"Because of the antipathy and overabundance of perceived problems related to herbal remedies by the medical profession,\" participant 56 (a dietician) who claimed there was, \"Not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines and potential interactions with Western medicines,\" and participant 69 (a doctor) who stated, \"It all depends on the evidence base! Great damage is done when people take alternative medicine instead of medicine proven to work.\" The Mintel Report (2009) claims that doctors and pharmacists may be uncomfortable referring patients to herbalism due to the lack of regulation, this was also observed within this research sample whereby HCPs said that the lack of regulation was one of the main reasons for not recommending HMs. This is further supported by the findings of the DTB survey of HMs which found that 84% (n=138) of HCPs surveyed did not think HMs were well regulated (DTB, 2010). 127 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Some of the other reasons participants in this study refused to recommend HMs to patients included: Participant 16 (clinical pharmacist), \"Difficult to quantify, as each case would vary in view of co-morbidities and individuals.\" Participant 22 (medicines information pharmacist), \"As a healthcare professional recommendations on treatment should be evidence based...evidence for efficacy and safety of herbal remedies is lacking, therefore I would not recommend herbal remedies.\" Participant 32 (senior pharmacist), \"There are not enough large comparable clinical trials into herbal medicines to warrant advising patients to use them instead of Western medicines. There is insufficient data for mixing herbal medicines and Western medicines, much of the advice provided to my patients if they state they want to use herbs as well as Western medicine is based on limited data and theory.\" Participant 77 (GP), \"I work on evidence based medicine principles and therefore unless trial evidence available I could not in good faith recommend them.\" Participant 84 (pharmacist), \"I do not recommend herbal remedies due to concerns over interactions with conventional medication. I think they could play a role in prevention\/treatment of health conditions but there is variable quality between preparations which again means I do not feel I can recommend them. I do not see the harm in someone not taking a conventional medication trying herbal remedies.\" According to the GPhC standards of conduct, ethics, and performance, pharmacist are not allowed to recommend any remedy where they have any reason to doubt the safety or quality (Rees et al., 2014). In addition, pharmacists should only offer advice on HMs if they have had suitable training or knowledge. Some participants who said they would not recommend HMs went on to say they would recommend HMs if they had better knowledge of HMs; like participant 11 (a pharmacist) who claimed, \"I would recommend herbal remedies to patients if my knowledge on it was sufficient. As I do not know much about it and how it works to treat different conditions, I cannot really recommend it.\" Similarly to the findings of this research, Koh et al. (2003) found that many pharmacists like doctors did not believe they had the basic knowledge about HMs to be able to recommend them safely. Other participants who said they would recommend HMs if there was more evidence to support their use such as participant 69 (a doctor) who said, \"Herbal remedies are fine, but I will only prescribe them when I have evidence that they work better than conventional therapy and that they are safe to use within the context of the pharmaceutical regimens the 128 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra patient is already on.\" Furthermore, participant 106 (a pharmacist) claimed, \"The biggest problem with traditional herbal remedies is lack of information. The most common query I get regarding herbal products is \"Is this safe with my other medication?\" While there are very good books around (e.g. Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions) and advice (e.g. from the NPA) the books are rarely available in the average pharmacy and a phone enquiry cannot always give the immediate response that a customer may want. As a result it is frequently necessary to err on the side of caution and say that I cannot recommend it as I do not have sufficient information on the product.\" Just 35% (n=34) of participants said they would recommend HMs to their patients. The types of herbal remedies participants said they would recommend are summarised in Table 3-7. The most common herbal remedies participants said they would recommend included turmeric for various ailments such as cough, sore throat, skin conditions, and wound healing. Honey and lemon for coughs and colds, and evening primrose oil for low mood. Some of the reasons participants said they would recommend HMs to their patients included: Participant 12 (pharmacist), \"The use of herbal medicines is safe if used in context of other co-administered drugs and with full knowledge of the effects of the herb.\" Participant 20 (clinical pharmacist\/ senior lecturer), \"Alongside allopathic medicines provided the patient consults the pharmacist - I think the patients' faith in day to day traditional herbs and spices also helps them psychologically.\" Participant 27 (optometrist student), \"Because it will most probably be preservative free meaning less adverse reactions from patients. Most likely to have less side effects. More positive effects then negative even if used long term. Herbal medicines are sustainable.\" Participant 70 (pharmacist\/ researcher), \"If they are effective and safe, why not?\" Participant 88 (pharmacist), \"Because it is safer, effective and with less side effect than conventional medicine.\" 129 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Table 3-7 Herbal Remedies Healthcare Professionals Would Recommend To Their Patients Participant Number: Herbal Remedies Healthcare Professionals Would Recommend: 2 Turmeric for digestive complaints. Rhodiola for energy. Saw Palmetto for Libido. 3 Using ginger in tea or in foods to help with sickness. Green tea to help with digestion and due to anti- oxidant properties. 6 Tea bags for dry eyes. 18 Peppermint products for IBS. 21 Turmeric as it works for me! 23 For minor ailments such as cough and cold: honey and liquorice, honey and lemon. For Indigestion: fennel seeds, mint, aniseed. 26 Aloe vera creams, neem soap-is effective for patients who have skin conditions such as eczema. 46 Very simple remedies which I have tried and tested, mainly those involving turmeric and honey as previously stated. 47 For examples garlic against infections. 49 Yam for arthritis. 63 Passion flower for stress. Agnus castus for PMS\/ cycle regulation. Saw palmetto for prostate (BP) related lower urinary tract symptoms. 64 For mood - St. John's wort or evening primrose oil. 68 Black cohosh. Evening primrose oil Saw palmetto. 73 Of course most elements and biological substances have active ingredients and while all are bad for you in excess- even water - many have been synthesised, including the first manufactured drug aspirin (from salicylic acid, originally from tree bark). In fact when herbal remedies are proved in scientific trials to have beneficial effect they are absorbed in mainstream medicine. What is left is usually of minor or no value, based on placebo effect and encouraging pseudoscience. 74 Honey and lemon is much better than cough syrups. 81 Peppermint for digestive issues. 82 Echinacea proven remedy anything that I have the evidence for. 91 Typically, for constipation- figs, prunes and pears. Natural constipation relief with the added benefit of all other associated nutrients. 103 Prevention as part of balanced diet. 108 I've recommended using cider vinegar to help with arthritis as I've seen that it helped my mum. 130 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Howard et al. (2001) found that in their survey of 70 pharmacists, 53% claimed to use dietary supplements themselves, they later went on to conclude that personal use correlated to an increased likelihood of making a recommendation to a patient. This can also be seen from the results of this investigation; participants who used HMs were generally more inclined to recommend them to their patients (Figure 3-8). Newall et al. (1996) say that HCPs need to be aware of the suitability of herbal remedies, even if HCPs do not use HMs themselves or believe they are effective they should still have some awareness about HMs as their patients may be using them. Heuschkel et al. (2002) found that one of the reasons respondents in their survey, about the use of CAM in patients with IBD, said they would use complementary therapies was if they were recommended by a doctor. The results from this survey suggest that some HCPs would recommend HMs, while others may have their reservations. Generally, the reasons for not recommending HMs were due to concerns of potential interactions with CWM, reduced compliance with prescribed medication, lack of evidence to support the use of HMs (i.e. limited safety and efficacy data), and HCPs personal lack of knowledge of HMs. Participants who were happy to recommend HMs had positive attitudes towards HMs, and often had tried HMs themselves. If there was better evidence to support the use of HMs and HCPs were more competent many said they would recommend HMs to their patients. 010203040506070No YesParticipants Personally Use Herbal RemediesNumber of ParticipantsPersonal Use of Herbal Remedies and Recommendations To Patients Wouldrecommend HMsWould notrecommend HMsFigure 3-8 Correlation of Healthcare Professionals' Personal Use of Herbal Remedies to Recommending Herbal Remedies to Patients 131 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 13: Did you receive any information about herbal medicines during your professional training? As the literature available on how much information is passed on to undergraduate HCPs was limited this question was designed to try and establish whether or not HCPs in the UK had received any training on HMs. Over a third of participants (35%, n= 34) said they did receive some information on HMs while undertaking their professional training. This was exemplified by participant 33 (a senior lecturer in law, ethics and pharmacy practice) who said, \"When I trained (in the 1970's) there was a large amount of pharmacognosy taught and that did cover materials of plant origin but not herbal remedies specifically.\" However, a large number of participants (65%, n=62) said they did not receive any information about HMs during their training. HCPs are at the frontline of patient care so need to be competent in giving advice and treating patients appropriately especially if they may be taking HMs. If HCPs are not adequately trained it could affect patient care, increase the risk of interactions with CWM, and adverse effects may go undetected. Question 14: Do you think enough training is provided to you about herbal medicines? The results from this question revealed that the vast majority of participants (74%, n=71) said they did not think enough information was provided to them on HMs. Participant 67 (a professor emeritus of surgery and medical humanities) stated, \"Our students should be taught that there are no metaphysical difference in biological activity between herbal and pharmaceuticals.\" Koh et al. (2003) conducted over 400 surveys on pharmacists in Singapore to find out about their use, knowledge and attitudes towards CAM; they found that 90.5% (n=380) felt not enough information on CAM was provided during their training. Although regulatory bodies such as the GMC and GPhC do require undergraduate students to be informed about CAM, they do not specify the content. As the brief is often so broad (i.e. the GPhC standards for education states 'complementary therapies') this leaves schools open to decide what they think is suitable to meet the requirements (GPhC, 2011). Research by Smith (2011) found that in some medical schools, in the UK, a single lecture was deemed sufficient. It may be useful for regulatory bodies to clarify the extent to which CAM should be taught to students (Smith, 2011) to better prepare future HCPs to deal with patients taking HMs. 132 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Some participants in this study (26%, n=25) said they thought enough training was provided; for example, participant 85 (a pharmacist) who stated, \"I know about herbal medicines as I studied pharmacognosy during my bachelor's degree in India\"; however, this participant did her pharmacy degree in India where training on HMs is commonly included in the curriculum. Furthermore, Participant 61 (a GP) who said he did not receive any information on THM while training, nor did he think enough training was provided then went on to say, \"It's difficult to see how further training in a totally different method of medicine, using preparations with significantly varying concentrations of active ingredients and unregulated or tested by MHRA could be fitted in to an already overloaded curriculum.\" The comments made by participant 61 suggest that the intensive training programmes HCPs endure are already straining; similar responses were also seen by Smith (2011). When Smith (2011) contacted UK medical schools to investigate the extent of inclusion of CAM education in undergraduate courses it was revealed that schools felt there was a lack of interest from staff and students in CAM, limited funding, and most importantly the programmes were already congested. Newall et al. (1996) claims that, \"a pharmacist should be able to advise the consumer on the rational and safe use of all medicines; thus, a pharmacist should be fully informed about the quality, safety, and efficacy of herbal medicines.\" However, if this vital information is not transmitted to HCPs while they are training it would be difficult for them to gain this knowledge. Research conducted by the DTB (2010) explored how well informed HCPs felt that doctors were about HMs; 75.5% felt doctors were 'poorly informed' about HMs, while only 21.5% felt that doctors were 'well informed'. As the popularity of HMs increases, more high quality research to support the use of HMs is required. Vickers (2000) claims that research on CAM is being conducted worldwide reflecting the growing awareness of the use of HMs. This will enable HCPs to be educated about HMs with reliable evidence based guidelines, an issue which was raised by many participants in this investigation. Regulatory bodies should make requirements for CAM education clearer so HCPs are equipped with the knowledge to deal with HMs queries competently. Educating future HCPs and providing continual professional development (CPD) programmes to encompass HMs will help HCPs make better informed decisions about HMs. 133 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Question 15: Any other comments: The final question gave participants the opportunity to share any comments and feedback. Table 3-8 summarises the remarks made by participants. Most of the comments were generally about the structure and content of the survey. Some participants, such as participant 22, were very engaged with the questionnaire and had several points they wanted to highlight. There were concerns that just participants who used or had knowledge about HMs would complete the survey giving biased results; however, the comments suggest participants with a range of opinions completed the survey, not just people who are in favour of HMs. Table 3-8 General Comments from Healthcare Professionals Participant Number: General Comments: 2 Very nice survey, number 10 - it depends what health conditions.... 12 In line with question 12, more information is needed rather than an outright rejection by healthcare practitioners. 16 All the best with the project! 22 Your survey does not give the opportunity to say that I am happy for patient's to take alternative remedies as long as they are safe, of good quality and do not interact with other drugs. I am aware of the beneficial effects (may be placebo) of the patient being empowered by being in control of their own therapy. Taking alternative remedies should not stop a patient reporting the condition\/side effect that they are treating to their clinician. Very little information is available on South Asian alternative remedies. Have great concerns about quality of products available. 30 Use of herbal medicines is common amongst people living with HIV. This might be an area to investigate in the future. 43 Difficult to answer some questions which are closed questions and therefore black and white. 49 Would love to hear more. 50 Lot of potential. Needs research. 64 I am in mental health and do not prescribe so limited experience of patients' prescription medicines for things other than depression and pain. 66 What matters is not what people think, but what the evidence says."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T08:58:40.707805Z","inner_id":29,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":30,"annotations":[{"id":31,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":5146,"end":5154,"text":"diabetes","labels":["Medical

there is no yes or no answer for question 10 and 11. 81 Would have been nice to have a list of herbal medicines plants spices to help channel thoughts with regards to answers in survey. 90 It would be

HCPs survey was published online using the SurveyMonkey software, and distributed via social media (Facebook and Twitter), which enabled a range of HCPs from across the UK to participate. In total 112 surveys were attempted with participants dropping out at various stages; although 93 surveys were completed, responses for incomplete surveys were also used in the analysis to avoid losing some valuable data. This research has provided a unique insight into HCPs personal and professional opinions of HMs. As there is limited research into UK based HCPs views of HMs the results from this study can be used to contribute to this discipline. The use of social media to conduct scientific research has only gained attention in the last few years (Sarker et al., 2015), and proved to be highly valuable while conducting this research. By using social media to distribute the link to this survey it enabled HCPs from across the UK to be contacted to participate in this research. A range of different HCPs comprised this research population, instead of being limited to a single group of HCPs which would have been the case if postal questionnaires were used. As the survey was published online via SurveyMonkey it was easy to create, modify, and track the progress of the questionnaire. Other benefits of conducting this research using social media included the fast and efficient distribution of the survey, lots of responses were collected in a short period of time, and it was cheaper than printing and posting the questionnaires. The disadvantages of using social media while conducting this research included the lack of control of who was sharing the link, who was completing the questionnaire, and participants dropping out partway through. If the surveys were conducted face to face the process could have been regulated better with fewer participants dropping out or missing questions (Moore, 2000). The main issue was the lack of control over who was completing the questionnaire. One completed survey raised concerns about whether or not the participant was a HCP from the UK. In the introductory statement before the questionnaire there was great emphasis on 'UK based HCPs'. When the link for the survey was posted on Twitter and Facebook it was also emphasised: \"If you are a UK based healthcare professional please take a few minutes to complete this survey.\" For this reason later a question was added at the end of the survey to determine whether or not participants did or had worked in the UK, to try and overcome the issue of HCPs from outside of the UK being included in the analysis. Finally, one of the most time consuming parts of this investigation was the ethical approval process, as the use of social media and online surveys is a relatively new way of conducting research there were no guidelines for ethical approval (Beninger et al., 2014). Uncertainty amongst internal (DMU) and external (NHS) ethics committees meant the ethical review process was lengthy and complicated. Despite some of the drawbacks encountered during this study, the results 135 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra suggest it has been a very useful way of conducting research. HCPs from across the UK, the researcher would not have ordinarily come into contact with were able to take part. Responses from a variety of different HCPs representing various professions, age groups, and ethnicities were able to contribute their knowledge and opinions. As the survey was available online it enabled participants the freedom to complete it at their own leisure and pass it on to other HCPs they knew. The HCPs that formed this survey population were from a range of professions including pharmacy, medicine, dentistry, optometry, research and academia. Participants from various ethnic groups completed the survey, making it possible to compare ethnic differences between knowledge and use of HMs. Just under half of the participants (45%, n=50) said the use of HMs was part of their traditional family and cultural background. There was a statistically significant association between the traditional use of HMs and ethnicity. SA ethnic groups were more likely to say HMs were part of their family and cultural background than any of the other ethnic groups; while White British\/ Irish participants were more likely to claim that HMs were not part of their traditional heritage. Over a third of participants (38%, n=42) said they used HMs themselves, these participants documented a large assortment of HMs they knew of or used. The most common products recalled by participants included turmeric, ginger, mint, honey, lemon, and Echinacea. Participants (53%, n=54) mentioned a wide range of HMs they knew of, for the four conditions listed: arthritis, cough, diabetes, and indigestion. In comparison to the findings from the SATMED questionnaire a more diverse range of herbal products were known and documented by the HCPs in this survey; products native to Asia (e.g. ajwain and tulsi) and Western countries (e.g. camomile and Echinacea) were mentioned. The diversity of products mentioned by HCPs could be because the questionnaire was open to all ethnic groups, and not restricted to just SA participants like the SATMED questionnaire. The results from this analysis revealed that HCPs who completed this survey had variable knowledge of HMs; some participants had extensive insight into a broad range of HMs, while others had limited knowledge. A difference in knowledge of HMs between ethnic groups was also identified, as more SA HCPs recalled HMs in comparison to White British\/Irish HCPs. This knowledge difference could be linked to the traditional heritage of HMs amongst SA cultures which SA participants referred to in both this survey and the SATMED questionnaire. From the comments of several participants it was evident they were keen to learn more about HMs if there was evidence to support the claims associated with the use of HMs. When HCPs in this study were asked if their patients told them about their use of HMs 65% (n=64) said they did. However, when participants from the SATMED questionnaire were asked whether or not they told their doctor or pharmacist about their use of HMs, 69% 136 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra (n=73) said they did not tell their doctor while 82% (n=87) did not tell their pharmacist. This is supported by the findings of several studies which have found patients do not always tell their HCPs about their use of HMs. Giveon et al. (2004) found that 44.7% of participants did not tell their doctor about their use of HMs, whilst 11% did but only rarely. Results from the Ipsos MORI report (2008) on public perceptions of HMs found that 56% of participants felt it was important to tell their doctor about their use of HMs; interestingly they found that Asian and Black minority ethnic groups were less likely to disclose information about their use of HMs to their doctors (Ipsos MORI, 2008). The qualitative results from the SATMED questionnaire revealed that SA participants did not want to tell their HCPs about their use of HMs as they were afraid of being treated differently or not treated at all. The high rates of under reporting the use of HMs by patients may be influenced by several factors, of which ethnicity may be one (Williamson et al., 2013; Ipsos MORI, 2008); this could explain why the results for not reporting the use of HMs to HCPs was so high in the SATMED survey. The HCPs in this survey revealed that their patients informed them about their use of HMs fairly frequently. The importance of accepting and understanding cultural differences is vital for HCPs to be able to build rapport with their patients; as Staines (2011) highlighted, that negative attitudes of HCPs towards alternative therapies could be detrimental to the relationship with their patients. Building trust will help patients feel at ease when disclosing information about their use of HMs to their HCPs; this is vital for providing appropriate care for patients, identifying adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and interactions with HMs. Numerous herbal ADRs were noted by 31% (n=30) of participants. Some ADRs identified were considered to be minor effects (e.g. local irritation caused by using tea tree oil); whereas, others were more fatal and sometimes life threatening (e.g. hypoglycaemia caused by karela, or deranged liver functions caused by Kava kava). As people using HMs often 'self-prescribe' the risks associated with ADRs may not be known; Barnes et al. (1998) found that those who experienced ADRs (minor or serious) from HMs were less likely to see their GP than if it was an ADR caused by CWM. Although efforts to improve herbal pharmacovigilance have been implemented (i.e. the yellow card scheme has been extended to include herbal ADRs), herbal ADRs are still underreported and go unmonitored (Barnes, 2003). This reinforces the importance of HCPs being competent in recognising and reporting incidents associated with HMs. The most common herb-drug interaction reported by 33 participants in this research involved SJW. SJW was the third best-selling herbal remedy in the UK in 2013 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2014). Its traditional use for mild depression and anxiety has become so popular its status as a traditional herbal remedy has been questioned. It is one of the few HMs for which there is extensive research and clinical evidence to support the traditional health claims 137 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra associated. It could be due to the wealth of literature available for SJW that makes it so well known to HCPs. The most common CWM which participants identified as being affected by HMs was warfarin. Many participants described HMs which could potentially affect the efficacy of warfarin including garlic, gingko, SJW, and cranberry juice. Polypharmacy with CWM is common practice in patients with multiple health conditions; combining HMs into the mixture could increase the risk of ADRs and interactions (Edwards et al., 2012). Due to the unknown risk of herb-drug interactions some HCPs believe it is best to avoid taking HMs alongside CWM (Fugh-Berman and Ernst, 2001). Almost two thirds of participants (63%, n=62) in this survey were aware of herb-drug interactions and documented some of their knowledge. The 37% (n=36) of participants who said they were not aware of interactions between HMs and CWM highlighted the importance of educating HCPs about the potential risks associated with consuming HMs alongside CWM. Despite the range of ADRs and herb-drug interactions documented by the research participants their views on the safety and efficacy of HMs were mixed; 66% (n=63) of participants thought HMs were effective for treating and preventing various health conditions, and 58%, (n=56) said they were safe. Some participants felt the long standing use of HMs throughout history was sufficient evidence to support the use of HMs, while others made reference to the lack of evidence based medicine and scientific validation of HMs. The 42% (n=40) of participants who said they did not think HMs were safe and the 34% (n=33) who did not think they were effective felt the lack of clinical evidence for HMs meant they could not make an informed decision to determine the safety and efficacy of HMs. In addition, without randomised clinical trials to prove the efficacy of HMs many HCPs felt reluctant to recommend HMs to patients. Nevertheless, it was observed that those HCPs who had personally tried or used HMs were more likely to recommend them to their patients. Vickers (2000) suggested that recent advances in research have provided some good evidence to support the use of some complementary therapies; in addition, more research is being conducted around the world to provide evidence to support the use of CAM. Funding to support research has also been increased, although it still lags behind other areas of research and is still fairly restricted (Vicker, 2000; Cant et al., 2012). The significant majority of participants (65%, n=62) claimed they were not given any information on HMs during their professional training; while, even more participants (74%, n=71) believed that not enough training was provided on HMs. These results have given an insight into what HCPs in the UK think about the current level of education on HMs provided to them. The analysis reveals that HCPs are not satisfied with the existing level of training they receive on HMs, and many felt incompetent giving advice about HMs to their patients. Although regulatory bodies such as the GMC and GPhC do set standards which 138 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra require schools to include some information about CAM there is no defined syllabus; and in some cases a single lecture was deemed sufficient to meet the standards set by regulatory bodies (Smith, 2011). Very little high quality research on CAM exists (House of Lords, 2000), this could be a key reason as to why it is not extensively taught in undergraduate courses. More money is being invested in exploring the risks and benefits of CAM, and high quality research is being conducted worldwide (Vicker, 2000); this will provide better resources to educated HCPs so they can make informed decisions about HMs. Several participants expressed their interest in learning about HMs, especially if there was scientific evidence to support their use. There are some very useful texts to help HCPs learn about HMs, such as Stockley's Herbal Medicines Interactions (Williamson et al., 2013) and Phytopharmacy - An Evidence Based Guide To Herbal Medicinal Products (Edwards et al., 2015); however they are not readily available to all HCPs. The British National Formulary (BNF) is a vital resource for HCPs and is available to all doctors and pharmacists and many other HCPs. The BNF July 2015 edition explains why information on HMs is not included in the BNF; it states, \"while it would be useful to have information about herbal medicines in the BNF, in order to provide reliable and authoritative information on homeopathic or herbal medicines, it would be necessary to set up a parallel structure with specific expertise in complementary medicine. It would be very difficult to achieve this and to include all the information in the BNF.\" Having access to texts which would help HCPs make informed decisions about the safety and efficacy of HMs will help improve HCPs knowledge of HMs, relationships with patients, and increase HCPs confidence in advising patients about the use of HMs (Pokladnikova and Lie, 2008). As the popularity of HMs continues to grow (Zhang et al., 2012), and HMs become more integrated into Western healthcare (Vickers, 2000), the importance of HCPs being aware of the risks and benefits of consuming HMs alone or in conjunction with CWM will become more important. In order to ensure patients are receiving the correct pharmacological care it is vital for HCPs to deduce their patients' use of HMs; a concept which needs to be reinforced to HCPs in the UK. Changes to the regulation of HMs and more clinical research are providing evidence based support for the safety and efficacy of HMs. Furthermore, better training and education on HMs for future HCPs means they will be equipped with the knowledge to identify potential ADRs and interactions, and advise patients on the safe use of HMs. There are very few studies which have explored UK based HCPs views on CAM (Smith, 2011), and little research actually focuses on just HMs. The results from this investigation have enabled an insight into HCPs personal use and professional views of HMs to be uncovered; providing valuable data for future research. 139 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 4.0 Chapter 4 - The Tulsi Project 4.1 Introduction The Tulsi Project was developed after considering the results from the main South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) questionnaire (Chapter 2); which explored the current use of traditional herbal medicines (THM) by South Asian (SA) diasporic communities, in the United Kingdom (UK). DNA authentication projects conducted by colleagues at De Montfort University (Chapter 2, section 2.6.2, p37) and other researchers have highlighted how DNA barcoding has been used to identify adulterant and substitute species in herbal medicines (Howard et al., 2009; Kumar, 2015; Seethapathy, 2015) have inspired this research. Tulsi (Holy basil, O. tenuiflorum L.) was identified as one of the most popular herbal ingredients used and known by the SATMED participants. This plant stood out from all of the other common herbal products identified such as ginger (Zingiber Officinale Roscoe) and turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) for several reasons. Firstly, the numerous health benefits associated with tulsi ranged from minor skin ailments to long term health problems like asthma and diabetes (Chapter 2, Section 2.6.2, p37). When participants were asked if they grew any plants for medicinal purposes, tulsi was one of the main plants, after mint, which was grown; tulsi seeds were commonly brought to the UK from Africa and India. In addition, when participants revealed what products they imported to the UK from abroad it was commonly dried tulsi leaves or seeds; with reference to the poor growth conditions and low survival rates of the plant in the UK. The religious significance of tulsi was also noted as participants referred to the value of the plant for Hindus. After considering all the information collected, it was evident that participants grew their own tulsi plants, imported material from abroad (Africa and India), and bought commercial products from suppliers in the UK, online, and abroad. A variety of different tulsi plants were recognised by participants, with frequent references made to Raam, Shyam (Krishna), and Vana tulsi. Raam and Shyam tulsi are varieties of O. tenuiflorum which is native to Asia; whilst some authors claim Vana tulsi is O. gratissimum L. (Joshi et al., 2012). As participants revealed that they grew plants from seeds they acquired from abroad, an interest in the species of tulsi plants grown in the UK developed; the applications of DNA analysis for species authentication to identify tulsi species were then explored. DNA barcoding is a relatively new technique that can be used to discriminate between different plant species, and identify any contaminants or adulterants."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T12:43:21.366877Z","inner_id":30,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":31,"annotations":[{"id":32,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":661,"end":679,"text":"Ocimum

literature around this topic is ever expanding and it is anticipated that the results from this investigation will 140 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra have a novel contribution. A range of tulsi samples were collected which were subjected to DNA analysis to determine their species. Samples were collected from research participants (community samples), as well as commercial samples, and authenticated species for the identification process. This research involved a multi-disciplinary approach by combining social science research methods with molecular techniques. 4.2 Aim of the Tulsi Project The aim is to investigate the cultural and commercial value of tulsi, Ocimum tenuiflorum, amongst diasporic South Asian communities in the UK; and to authenticate tulsi samples using DNA-based analytical techniques. 4.3 Objectives of the Tulsi Project 1. Explore the cultural and commercial values associated with tulsi, in South Asian communities in the UK. 2. Collect a range of tulsi products and perform DNA analyses in order to: classify species, identify genetic variations, and isolate adulterant species. 4.4 Background to the Research This section will give an insight into the origins, cultural values, medicinal uses, and botanical identity of tulsi; in order to establish the importance of this research. An explanation of the traditional and new research methods used for medicinal plant identification will highlight the potential applications of DNA barcoding. 4.4.1 Origins of Tulsi Tulsi is native to tropical Asia, it grows wild in warm regions. It has been used in South Asia, China, the Middle East, Africa and Australia for centuries (Maimes, 2004). With the migration of people, the plant has become available around the world, and varieties are even grown in the UK. As the tulsi plant travelled West, it became known to Christians as \"holy\" basil as is reflected in its Latin binomial, O. sanctum L. (now referred to as O. tenuiflorum L.). The scared plant was given as a gift in the annual celebration of the birth of St. Basil, as people gave it the status as a 'gift from Christ' (Miller and Miller, 2003). 141 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Tulsi is used in various traditional medical systems including: Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. Ayurvedic scriptures refer to tulsi as one of the main pillars of herbal medicine, first mentioned in the Rig Veda around 1500 BC. It is widely incorporated in traditional Indian cuisine, cosmetics, herbal remedies and religious ceremonies (poojas). The whole plant can be used, seeds, roots, leaves, flowers and even the stem (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). The woody stem is often used to make tulsi beads, worn as necklaces or bracelets believed to provide physical protection, and even made into rosaries for spiritual protection (Miller and Miller, 2003). Daily use of tulsi is believed to help maintain balance of the chakras, energy centres of the body (Winston and Maimes, 2007). Tulsi is one of the most sacred plants on the Indian subcontinent, as it represents a Hindu goddess, Virinda Tulsi. Legend has it that Virinda was married to a demon called Jalandhar who was destroying the world. Due to Virinda's purity and devotion to God her evil husband was immortal. The only way to kill Jalandhar was if his wife's purity was tarnished. Lord Krishna disguised himself as Virinda's husband and tainted Virinda's purity; which led to the death of Jalandhar. Virinda felt she had been betrayed by the Gods and threw herself onto her husband's burning pyre, to relieve herself from the shame of cheating on her husband. From this it is said her soul was transformed into the tulsi plant and Lord Krishna vowed to marry her to take away the shame. Hence, every year the wedding anniversary, Tulsi Vivah, is celebrated by Hindus around the world (Figure 4-1). It is Virinda Tulsi's purity and devotion to God which makes Hindus believe the plant is so pure and sacred; thus the plant is incorporated in religious ceremonies, used as religious offerings (Prasad), and added to the burning pyre of the deceased where it is believed to aid the passage to heaven (Shatri Ramnik Dev, 2013). Tulsi plants are supposedly kept in every Hindu temple and most households where it is thought to be a blessing if the plant grows (Wagner, 2010).

Tulsi is considered one of the most powerful herbs as it is used for treating a vast array of medical disorders; including conditions which affect the skin, the cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, and central nervous system (Winston and Maimes, 2007). Traditionally tulsi has been used to treat asthma, bronchitis, diabetes, diarrhoea, eye disorders (chronic conjunctivitis, cataracts, and glaucoma), fever, insect bites, snake bites, malaria, and a variety of skin diseases. Tulsi is also known to have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antidiabetic, anticancer, antifertility, anti-inflammatory, adaptogenic, analgesic, cardioprotective, and hepatoprotective properties (Prakash and Gupta, 2005; Philip and Unni, 2011; Singh et al., 2012). Different parts of the tulsi plant including the seeds, roots, stems, and leaves are known to possess therapeutic properties and are used to formulate herbal remedies (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). There are various ways to consume tulsi in order to reap the medicinal benefits. Fresh or dried tulsi leaves can be eaten, used in cooking, infused in tea, hot water, or bath water. A variety of commercial tulsi products are also available including: capsules, creams, juices, oils, shampoos, soaps, tablets, teas, and tonics. Human and animal studies have suggested tulsi can be useful for diabetes as it has been found to alter glucose regulation via several pathways (Chattopadhyay, 1993; Vats et al., 2002; Prakash and Gupta, 2005). Agrawal et al. (1996) administered 2.5g of tulsi leaves to type 2 diabetic patients for sixty days and observed a decrease in fasting and post-prandial blood glucose. Tulsi has been shown to reduce blood glucose levels, and increase glycogen stores and insulin levels in the body (Joshi et al., 2012). Traditionally tulsi is believed to have been used as a contraceptive and to improve libido. The literature available on the antifertility and abortive effects of tulsi are dated (Khanna et al., 1986), but precaution in pregnant women are still taken (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). Studies in female rats found a reduction in implantation, full term pregnancies and a reduced litter size after the administration of tulsi (Vohra et al., 1969; Khanna et al., 1986). Animal studies suggest tulsi can temporarily reduce sperm count and sperm motility (Ahmed et al., 2002), and increase libido (Pande and Pathak, 2009). Hence, in India tulsi has traditionally been used as a male contraceptive (Sethi et al., 2010). Research even documents the powerful antibacterial effects of tulsi in treating the sexually transmitted disease, gonorrhoea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoea which is sensitive to extracts of O. tenuiflorum; Shokeen et al. (2005) refer to it as being as good as penicillin and ciprofloxacin. 143 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 4.4.3 Active Compounds in Tulsi The chemical composition of tulsi is complex and can vary between different cultivars (Rahman et al., 2011). The quantities of chemicals found in plants can be affected by the growing conditions, stage of harvesting (young or mature plant), processing and manufacturing stages, and storage conditions (Pattanayak et al., 2010). Tulsi plants contain a variety of saponins, flavonoids, triterpenoids, tannins and essentials oils; including, eugenol, methyl eugenol, eugenic acid, urosolic acid, carvacrol, linalool, limatrol, caryophyllene, and methy chavicol (Pattanayak et al., 2010; Rahman et al., 2011). Tulsi leaves contain the phenolic compounds eugenol and methyl eugenol which form part of the plants' essential oil content. Eugenol is responsible for the spicy aromatic fragrance produced by the plant, as well as some of the associated health benefits. Eugenol has antiseptic, anaesthetic, antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant effects. Quantitative variations have been seen in the composition of essential oils in tulsi plants grown in different parts of India, different seasons of harvesting and growing conditions (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). 4.4.4 Precautions with Tulsi Traditionally tulsi is avoided in pregnant women as it has been known to cause miscarriage and was used to induce abortion. Ursolic acid, one of the major constituents found in the leaves, is believed to have antifertility effects (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). Batta and Santhakumari (1970) demonstrated the antifertility affects in mice by administering a dose of 200mg\/kg of tulsi in a benzene vehicle to pregnant mice. Animal studies have shown the antifertility effects but the results remain dated and inconclusive (Gardner and McGuffin, 2013). Tulsi was traditionally considered to be a male contraceptive (Sethi et al., 2010) and has been associated with reducing sperm count and motility (Khanan et al., 1986; Ahmed et al., 2002); therefore, it should be avoided if trying to conceive. Some herbal remedies require fresh tulsi leaves to be chewed in order to obtain the medicinal effects. The plant contains natural mercury, which may be harmful to the teeth if the leaves are chewed and in prolonged contact with the mouth (Joshi et al., 2012). This can be avoided by swallowing the leaves whole with water or drinking infusions. If the plant is grown in areas where there are high levels of chromium contaminating the soil (i.e. from industrial leaks, fertilisers, and pesticides) it can have severe consequences as chromium can damage the liver and kidneys (Rai et al., 2004). 144 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Singh et al. (2001) revealed the fixed oil of tulsi at a dose of 3ml\/kg prolonged blood clotting time; they claimed the effect was because the oil prevented platelet aggregation. The blood thinning properties of tulsi have been compared to that of aspirin; therefore, people taking anti-platelets (e.g. aspirin and clopidogrel) and anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) should consume tulsi with great caution (Singh et al., 2001). Winston and Maimes (2007) highlight that tulsi enhances cytochrome CYP450 enzyme activity. This can increase elimination of drugs rendering them less useful or ineffective. However, the American Herbal Products Association released an updated botanical safety handbook in 2013 which stated there were no drug interactions or adverse effects identified for tulsi (Gardner and McGuffin, 2013). 4.4.5 Botanical Identity of Tulsi Typical characteristics of the Lamiaceae family include a square stem, opposite and decussate leaves, with numerous oil glands which secrete aromatic oils giving the plants distinct odours (Paton et al., 2005; Schmiderer et al., 2008). Part of the Lamiaceae family is the Ocimum genus, which has around thirty species (Paton, 1992). Alongside the traditional culinary basil (O. bascilium L.), tulsi (O. tenuiflorum L.) is the Indian alternative, commonly referred to as Holy basil; as reflected in its former Latin binomial O. sanctum L. which translates to sacred or the incomparable one. The word basil is likely to have originated from the Greek word Basileus which means kingly or royal. Some may refer to tulsi as the 'King of Herbs' however due to the Hindu association of the plant with the goddess Virinda Tulsi others call it the 'Queen of herbs' (Miller and Miller, 2003). Tulsi can be described as a highly branched herb or shrub which can grow up to a meter tall, from the tiny round, dark brown, odourless but pungent tasting seed (Joshi et al., 2012). The bright green to dark purple, aromatic leaves are classically arranged in an opposite formation, with an oval-oblong shape similar to that of mint leaves. The square stem is hairy, purple to brown coloured, and woody in appearance; while the flowers can range in colour from white, yellow, and purple (WHO, 2002b). There are a variety of different types of tulsi available (Figure 4-2). According to Ayurvedic scriptures the most common types being Raam tulsi, and Shyam also referred to as Krishna tulsi. Botanists classify these two types as O. tenuiflorum; and the less common type is Vana Kingdom: Plantae Division: Magnoliophyta Class: Magnoliopsida Order: Lamiales Family: Lamiaceae Genus: Ocimum Species: O. tenuiflorum Botanical name: O. tenuiflorum Synonyms: O. sanctum (Hiran, 2009) 145 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra tulsi (O. gratissimum) which is commonly known as African basil (Joshi et al., 2012). Although the plants are characteristically different, they may all be referred to and kept as tulsi (Maimes, 2004). Microscopic Characteristics of Tulsi WHO (2002) describes tulsi leaves as having a layer of small, quadrangular cells on the lower epidermis, trichomes of 2-6 cells, including short glandular trichomes, and diacytic stomata located on both the upper and lower epidermis. Similar studies by Datta et al. (2012) and Joshi et al. (2012) also recorded several important characteristics of tulsi including: oil globules, multicellular and unicellular simple and glandular trichomes (Figure 4-3). Figure 4-2 Raam, Shyam, and Vana Tulsi Grown In Bangalore, India Figure 4-3 Image of the Lower Epidermis of a Tulsi Leaf at 500x Magnification under a Scanning Electron Microscope Trichome Oil gland Stomata Taken at De Montfort University by R. Armitage and S. Bhamra. 146 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The image (Figure 4-3) reveals a high concentration of trichomes on the lower surface of the tulsi leaf. Trichomes often have several functions including: producing and storing essential oils and chemicals which may be used to supplement the defence mechanism of the plant, and offering protection to the leaf from insects and larvae (Levin, 1973). The structure, function, and density of trichomes can be used for taxonomic purposes. Numerous oil glands can also be seen in Figure 4-3. The Lamiaceae family has several species which are highly aromatic; most of the species produce and store essential oils in specialised epidermal oil glands (Schmiderer et al., 2008). The oils produced are distinctive of the species and can be used to identify the plants. The oils are composed of a mixture of compounds, which have many health benefits. The essential oils produced by tulsi contain the active compound eugenol, which has antiseptic and anaesthetic properties (Prakash and Gupta, 2005). The scent of the oil deters insects and has been used as a mosquito repellent (Joshi et al., 2012). 147 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 4.4.6 Methods of Plant Identification The European Pharmacopoeia is a standard reference for the quality control of medicines (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare, 2015); it has defined morphological and chemical profiles for medicinal plant species. Unlike traditional methods of plant authentication (i.e. morphology and chemical analysis) (Chen et al., 2014); DNA barcoding is a relatively new technique for plant identification, the applications of which are still being explored. Morphology A dichotomous key is used to sequentially identify parts of the plant to categorise the plants family, genus, and species (Jacono, 2009). Morphology encompasses the use of highly trained individuals who can identify the plants superficial structures to classify them; it includes the macroscopic and microscopic features. The macroscopic features are the physical characteristics of the plant such as the colour, size, structure, shape, taste, and aroma of the plant (Joshi et al., 2004). The microscopic structures of the plant can be seen using powerful microscopes and techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The morphological features can be affected by the age of the plant, stage of harvesting, processing, and storage of the plants (Joshi et al., 2004). A clear example of how age can affect the microscopic features can be seen in Figure 4-4; the younger tulsi leaf has more trichomes which may help protect the leaf during development, in comparison to the mature leaf which has less trichomes. SEM is a technique which can be used for examining plant surfaces at high resolution and to determine plant species. Electrons from a beam interact with atoms on the surface of the sample, producing an image of the surface composition. Previously, plant tissues needed to be preserved by dehydration for observation in an electron microscope otherwise the sample would be distorted under the high vacuum. Often samples had to be coated with conductive Figure 4-4 Image of Young and Mature O. tenuiflorum Leaf under a Scanning Electron Microscope Taken at De Montfort University by R. Armitage and S.

x = No DNA sequence obtained; \/ = DNA sequence successfully obtained. 182 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 4.6.2.3.1 Ocimum gratissimum Reference Specimen Three O. gratissimum reference specimens were obtained: G30 and G32 from Professor Peter Nick (Botanical Institute Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany), and C81 from The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew - DNA bank (Chase, M.W.). As all three samples have been identified by highly skilled botanists and identified as O. gratissimum, the sequence data of all three samples should align closely in a multiple alignment. Two samples G32 and C81 aligned together with no differences across 526 bases with the ITS region (Figure 4-21) and 336 bases with the trnH-psbA region (Figure 4-22); whereas, sample G30 did not match the other two references. The results were confirmed when the DNA samples were amplified and sequenced by both the ITS and trnH-psbA regions. To further validate these findings reference DNA sequences were obtained from GenBank and used in the analysis. ITS Sequencing of Ocimum gratissimum Reference Specimen Five O. gratissimum reference sequences obtained from GenBank were used to compare with the query samples (Figure 4-21). The alignment suggests there are two distinct varieties of O. gratissimum (A and B) which have not been differentiated. Across the entire sequence length ranging from 393-515 bases, for the ITS sequences, there are 14 bases which differentiate the two types of O. gratissimum (Appendix 13). A large number of base differences in not commonly seen in a species; but, could be explained by the high variability in the ITS region within the Ocimum species. To verify the difference was genuine the analysis was repeated using a different primer region (trnH-psbA). A B The multiple alignment represents several reference O. gratissimum sequences. Samples G30 and G32 from Professor Peter Nick, C81 from Kew DNA bank and five sequences from Genbank have been used to create this alignment which identifies there are two distinct types of O. gratissimum (A and B). Figure 4-21 Section of a Multiple Alignment of Reference O. gratissimum ITS Sequences 183 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra trnH-psbA Sequencing of Ocimum gratissimum Reference Specimen When searching for trnH-psbA reference samples, three O. gratissimum sequences were found on GenBank and used to compare the three reference specimens in question (G30, G32, and C81). Figure 4-22 highlights that sample G30 (A) has a perfect match with the three reference sequences from GenBank; while G32 and C81 (B) still align with each other, but are slightly different from the other four sequences. Across the 319 bases in the alignment there are just 3 base differences. Although there are not as many base differences seen with the trnH-psbA region, in comparison to the ITS region, the differences observed were valid. For each of the reference samples, three independent sequences were aligned in a contig to ensure a reliable consensus sequence was produced; therefore, the results from this investigation are reliable. It can be confirmed the quality of the sequence data for samples G32 and C81 was good, with clean single peaks at the base positions where the difference were found. Summary of Ocimum gratissimum Results Using both the ITS and trnH-psbA regions two varieties of O. gratissimum were identified; these were discriminated by several base differences. Although the ITS region showed greater variability between the two varieties, the trnH-psbA sequences were of high enough quality to support these findings. Using two regions has proved to be valuable in this investigation, as they have helped to verify the results. This study identifies the possibility of having different varieties of the same species; these may be referred to as cryptic or sibling species as they are morphologically identical but their genetic barcode may be significantly different (Saez and Lozano, 2005). A B A B The multiple alignment represents several reference O. gratissimum sequences. Samples G30 and G32 from Professor Peter Nick, C81 from Kew DNA bank and three sequences from Genbank have been used to create this alignment which identifies two O. gratissimum subgroups (A and B). Figure 4-22 Section of a Multiple Alignment of Reference O. gratissimum trnH-psbA Sequences 184 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Community Tulsi Samples A total of 26 community tulsi samples were collected from participants encountered throughout the research period. The species for 84% (n=22) of the samples were identified using either one or both of the barcoding regions - ITS (n=15) or trnH-psbA (n=22). The results have been summarised in Table 4-4 which details the sample identification number, where samples were originally obtained from (donor), the donor location, reported country of origin, the type of tulsi (i.e. Raam, Shyam or unknown), and the species identification after amplification of the ITS and trnH-psbA regions. The different species identified have been colour coded to easily identify the species of the tulsi samples collected. As previously highlighted there are two varieties of O. tenuiflorum commonly known as Raam and Shyam tulsi (Joshi et al., 2012). The results from this analysis revealed that most (n=10) of the Shyam tulsi samples collected from the UK and India were O. tenuiflorum; however, Raam tulsi (n=8) samples from the UK and Africa were identified as being O. gratissimum instead. Just one Raam tulsi sample (B102c) collected in India by participant B102 was correctly identified as O. tenuiflorum. One Raam tulsi sample (B04) collected from Birmingham which was a cutting passed on from a friend matched closely to O. basilicum. These results indicate the species of the tulsi plants are different to what they are expected to be (i.e. tulsi should be O. tenuiflorum). Issues with nomenclature were also identified by Jurges et al. (2009) who found that tulsi may be used to refer to any type of basil rather than a specific species. Whether or not the species of tulsi is important to people who keep tulsi is not known, but could be explored further in the future. Of the 8 samples which were identified as O. gratissimum, five samples were specifically identified as being Raam tulsi by participants. Just one participant B02b thought her tulsi was a Shyam tulsi plant but instead it matched with the Raam tulsi samples identity of O. gratissimum. These results confirm the findings which suggest that O. gratissimum species may be kept as a substitute for O. tenuiflorum in the UK. Three samples matched closely to O. basilicum reference sequences from GenBank including B04, L11 (the origins of these samples were unknown), and Li80 who noted that the sample was a basil collected from a friend's garden (Table 4-4). The species for four of the samples could not be authenticated. Two of these were seed samples (B12 and B105) which failed to germinate, while samples B09 and B101 failed to amplify with the ITS and trnH-psbA regions. Interestingly one sample (B03) from India was identified as a Veronica species. The seeds were germinated in a petri dish and re-grown in autoclaved soil to rule out the possibility of contamination in the soil but the same results were obtained. This could 185 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra suggest the seeds collected by this participant were not tulsi seeds and may have been wrongly identified.

A number of tulsi samples collected from SA communities in the UK and a sample posted from South Africa were labelled as Raam tulsi (Appendix 12). Upon identification of the species using the reference DNA barcodes, it appeared that Raam tulsi samples matched with the O. gratissimum reference sequences instead of O. tenuiflorum. This suggests that the species of Raam tulsi plants has been confused and substitution has occurred. Migration of SA communities from India to Africa and then to the UK may have affected the transfer of seeds and caused confusion of species. O. gratissimum is native to Africa and known to grow abundantly even in the wild; whereas, it is difficult to find in India and does not grow as well. Due to similar morphological features, it may have been misidentified by people or kept as a substitute as the preferred type was not available. Findings from the interviews for this research suggest Raam tulsi was easier to germinate and grow in comparison to Shyam tulsi, in the UK. The results suggest species substitution has occurred for Raam tulsi which appears to be O. gratissimum instead of O. tenuiflorum. Although reference specimens G32 and C81 were identified as O. gratissimum they appeared to be different to reference G30 (Figure 4-23), which aligned with all the community tulsi samples identified as Raam tulsi. From this analysis it can be concluded that two varieties of O. gratissimum were identified. Two community tulsi samples (B04 and L11) matched closely to O. basilicum reference sequences instead of O. tenuiflorum. This further supports the results which suggest the species of tulsi plants kept in the UK may have been substituted by alternative Ocimum species.

In total 47 samples including: capsules, creams, soaps, syrups, shampoos, teas, tablets, oils, toothpaste, and a tulsi rosary were bought. Raw tulsi material used by Pukka Herbs was also included in this collection. Table 4-5 summarises the species identification for the samples which were identified using the ITS and trnH-psbA regions. Just 5 commercial samples were identified using ITS primers (ITS 1 and ITS 4), while 13 samples were identified with the trnH-psbA region (complete list of the commercial products used in this analysis can be found in Appendix 12).

is a relatively new technique for plant authentication which requires more research, in comparison to the other identification methods which have a long standing and reputable use. The results from this investigation have revealed the usefulness of DNA analysis and can be used to contribute to this evolving discipline. 4.7.3 The Applications of DNA Barcoding for Medicinal Plant Identification While conducting background research into Ocimum DNA sequences it became apparent that there was a lack of reliable reference Ocimum DNA sequences available in the databases such as GenBank and BOLD. Chase et al. (2005) highlighted this as a potential limitation of DNA authentication, as there is a lack of DNA barcodes available in the reference databases. Before authentication of tulsi samples could commence a reference database needed to be created to be able to verify the species. This research has had an important role in collecting 196 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra a range of authenticated Ocimum specimens (n=33) from around the world to create reference barcodes which will make future authentication faster and reliable; in addition, these sequences will be submitted to the GenBank and BOLD databases. As recommended by The Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) Plant Working Group, initially the plastid matK and rbcL regions were explored for amplification of DNA samples (Kress et al., 2005; Chase et al., 2005). The PCR results were highly variable and the sequence data for the few samples which did provide a positive PCR result were very poor. From the literature it was clear these regions are highly valuable; however, their use with the Ocimum species was limited and required optimisation. When other regions such as the nuclear ITS and plastid trnH-psbA were explored amplification and sequencing results were much better. The ITS region had limited success as it was only able to amplify and sequence some of the Ocimum species (O. tenuiflorum, O. selloi, and O. gratissimum), while the trnH-psbA region provided better DNA sequencing data for a larger range of species. Of the total 111 tulsi and Ocimum samples collected during the research period, 82 samples were used for the final analysis of which 67 samples (82%) were successfully identified with the combination of the ITS and trnH-psbA regions. In order for DNA barcoding to work there must be enough variation in the DNA sequence to differentiate species from one another (interspecific variation); and a much lower level of variation within a species (intraspecific variation) (Lahaye et al., 2008). The intraspecific variation is known to be relatively low for both ITS and trnH-psbA (Kress et al., 2005). The results from this investigation revealed that the ITS region had higher intraspecific variation than the trnH-psbA region, as it was able to identify more base differences in the DNA sequence. The ITS region was highly variable but limited due to poor quality sequence data. The trnH-psbA region provides a high level of interspecific variation, therefore allowing the discrimination of different species (Kress et al., 2005). The results from this study revealed that both the ITS and trnH-psbA regions were able to distinguish and identify several Ocimum species; nevertheless, more samples (n=66) were identified using the trnH-psbA region than the ITS region (n=35). Several challenges of using the ITS region were encountered during the investigation, including the difficulty amplifying and sequencing samples, the amplification of fungal DNA instead of the plants, and poor quality sequence data possibly due to paralogous copies of ITS region being present. In cases where the complete ITS region was difficult to amplify and sequence the ITS2 region was recommended and tried; but, no improvement in results were obtained. The trnH-psbA region worked more efficiently than the ITS region and provided higher quality sequence data. Although, there is a risk of low variability within 197 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra species, the differences found for the Ocimum species was sufficient to discriminate between them. This was also observed by Hollingsworth (2011) who claimed the trnH-psbA region had better discriminatory power, and gave more efficient recovery of sequence data compared to other primer regions such as matK and rbcL. It has been proposed that a combination of regions should be used for the authentication of species (Kress et al., 2005; Li et al., 2011); this was successfully completed in this study and the results validated each other. A multigene approach using different priming regions such as the nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid trnH-psbA regions have been proposed as combinations for DNA barcoding (Chase et al., 2005; Kress et al., 2005). This study has implemented these proposals and discovered some interesting results. Both regions have had varying degrees of success with the Ocimum species. The trnH-psbA region proved to be better than the ITS region at sequencing the Ocimum samples, as it was able to authenticate more than double the number of samples. Reference specimens (n=33) obtained from several sources (Professor Peter Nick - Botanical Institute Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany; Dr. Eike Reich - Director at CAMAG Laboratory, Switzerland; and The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew - DNA bank) were used to create reference DNA sequences to identify the species of samples collected throughout the project. A large proportion of the samples collected for analysis (n=67, 82%) were identified using the reference DNA barcodes created. Fresh and dried leaf samples were the easiest to extract DNA from, amplify and sequence. A total of 26 community samples were collected of which 81% (n=21) were identified as an Ocimum species. Commercial products which had been processed were often difficult to extract DNA from, as identified by the NanoDrop analysis which often showed little or no absorbance at 280nm. This may be due to manufacturing processes involved in formulating the products which may have damaged and degraded the DNA. Although one of the advantages of DNA analysis is that it is not affected by manufacturing processes, the results from this study found that steam treatment and drying in extreme temperatures did degrade the DNA of commercial samples collected (n=47); making it very difficult and sometimes impossible to extract DNA. But, because the trnH-psbA region is a shorter fragment it worked better with commercial samples (i.e. 13 commercial samples species were identified) where the DNA may have been degraded or sheared into smaller fragments, in comparison to a longer region such as the ITS (i.e. 5 commercial samples species were identified). A large number of the commercial samples (72%, n=34) could not be used in the analysis as DNA was not successfully extracted, similar problems were also encountered by Jurges et al. (2009) who also struggled to authenticate the species of commercial tulsi products. 198 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 4.7.4 The Key Discoveries of the Tulsi Project The cultural and commercial values associated with the tulsi plant can increase the risk of adulteration due to the constant and rising demand of the market (Christina and Annamalai, 2014). The correct identification of tulsi plants is made difficult by the similar morphological features of the Ocimum species. Raam and Shyam tulsi samples collected in India looked very similar; whereas, samples from the UK were distinctly different. Both Raam and Shyam tulsi are supposed to be varieties of O. tenuiflorum; however, the DNA analysis identified Raam tulsi samples collected from SA communities in the UK and Africa as O. gratissimum instead. According to the results from this investigation, Raam tulsi species have been substituted in the UK; but how relevant this is to SA communities remains to be investigated. Many of the commercial samples collected did not specify the type of tulsi (i.e. Raam or Shyam), except for samples from Pukka Herbs(r); the Raam and Shyam tulsi samples from Pukka Herbs(r) did match the O. tenuiflorum references. In addition, Raam and Shyam samples collected personally during field work in India were also correctly identified as O. tenuiflorum; further supporting the theory of species substitution in the UK. Plant species which are difficult to source, expensive, and have limited availability are subject to adulteration with products which maybe morphologically similar. Using taxonomically correct plants is critical to the safety and efficacy of herbal medicine (WHO, 2002b). Adulteration of plants can have fatal consequences; therefore, the importance of selecting the correct plant species is of paramount importance, especially when consumed for medicinal purposes (Christina and Annamalai, 2014). The main reasons for keeping tulsi plants identified by participants in the UK were for cultural or religious purposes, in which case the species of the plant may not be as important. Different species may have different pharmacological effects; therefore, the species used for commercial and medicinal purposes must be properly identified and authenticated. DNA analysis has proved to be a technique which can accurately identify and discriminate between the Ocimum species. The results of this investigation have enabled new reliable reference DNA sequences for the Ocimum species to be created and will contribute to the DNA databases currently lacking this information (Appendix 13 & 15). This will enable more efficient authentication of Ocimum samples to take place. The ITS and trnH-psbA regions have been able to successfully authenticate and discriminate several Ocimum species. A range of unknown Ocimum samples have been identified, illustrating the usefulness of this technique. 199 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra 5.0 Chapter 5 - Discussion 5.1 Overview of the Research Outcomes The research set out to explore the knowledge and use of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian (SA) diasporic communities and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in the UK. The results of this investigation have provided an insight in to the current use of herbal medicines (HMs) by South Asians (SAs), where ingredients for HMs are sourced from, how minor ailments are treated, and where the knowledge of HMs originates from and is transmitted through generations (Chapter 2). Furthermore, patients' perspectives of HMs (i.e. SA participants taking conventional Western medicines) were compared with the views of HCPs in the UK (Chapter 3). SA participants and HCPs views of HMs and some of the key finding from this research have been summarised in Figure 5-1. Figure 5-1 highlights how the results of these two phases of the research identified the problem of species substitution and the need for authentication of HMs; as well as identifying a medicinal plant of interest (Tulsi, Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) for DNA analysis. Tulsi was one of the most popular medicinal plants mentioned by participants in both strands of the research; the religious significance and numerous medicinal benefits associated with the plant make it a culturally and commercially valuable plant. Figure 5-1 Venn Diagram of South Asian Participants and Healthcare Professionals views of Herbal Medicines and the Connection of the Three Phases of the Study The Venn diagram summarises some of the key themes identified and illustrates how the three phases of the research (i.e. SATMED Project, HCPs survey, and the Tulsi Project) interlink and led on to the identification of a medicinal plant of interest (i.e. Tulsi) for DNA analysis. Key: CWM - Conventional Western Medicines HMs - Herbal Medicines SA - South Asian SAs - South Asians 200 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The use of DNA barcoding in ethnobotany is relatively new (Newmaster and Ragupathy, 2010). This research represents the first time where the use of DNA barcoding in ethnobotany has been used to explore medicinal plants used by a diverse migrant community living in Western urban cities. A mixed methods approach combining social science research methods (i.e. questionnaires and interviews) and DNA barcoding techniques were used to fulfil the aims and objectives of this study. 5.1.1 Objective 1: Explore the knowledge and use of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian diasporic communities, in the UK; describe where the knowledge originates from. While conducting the background research for this investigation, it became apparent that there was very little information on the use of traditional HMs by SA communities in the UK. Recent ethnopharmacological research has either looked at the general UK populations' perspectives of HMs (Ipsos MORI, 2008; Mintel, 2009), or focused on a specific gender, religious or ethnic group (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005; Jennings, 2014). Hence, evidence of the current use of HMs amongst the wider SA population in the UK has been limited. Bhopal (1986a) conducted his research on the use of HMs by Asian communities over thirty years ago; the results of this study provide an important update on the use of HMs by SAs in the UK. The South Asian Traditional Medicines (SATMED) questionnaire was designed and administered by the primary researcher (Chapter 2), which enabled the collection of some valuable quantitative and qualitative primary data for this study. The migration of SAs introduced different religions, traditions, cultures, cuisines, and traditional herbal remedies to the UK (Sandhu and Heinrich, 2005); yet little was known about the current use of HMs by SAs in the UK, until this research was conducted. Figure 5-2 illustrates the migration of SA participants to the UK, which may have been direct from South Asia (i.e. India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh) or via other parts of the world (e.g. Africa, Europe, The Middle East, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, etc. ); it also summarises what participants brought to the UK with them (e.g. their knowledge and traditions of HMs) and the challenges participants faced in the UK (e.g. lack of knowledge of Western medicines, difficulty sourcing ingredients for HMs, and cultural\/ language barriers). 201 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra The knowledge of HMs has been passed on orally from generation to generation (Chhetri, 1994; Hatfield, 2007) and there is a risk of losing this knowledge if it is not documented (Thring and Weitz, 2006; Bhattia et al., 2014); this research has enabled some of this valuable information to be documented, as the vast range of ingredients, remedies, and products participants used for traditional HMs has been summarised (Appendix 5). Participants from the SATMED questionnaires (80%, n=101) and Tulsi Project interviews (62%, n=8) revealed that family was the primary source for transmitting the knowledge of traditional HMs; although, religion, the internet, television, and social media were emerging as alternative ways of learning about HMs. Hegg (2013) also identified the way people are learning about traditional HMs is changing, due to advances in technology and the popularity of social media. The SATMED questionnaire revealed that there was a significant difference in knowledge of HMs between the genders (i.e. females knew more about HMs than male participants). Ernst (2000) claims that women generally use HMs more than men which may explain this difference in knowledge. Furthermore, gender differences in knowledge of HMs were also found by the Ipsos MORI (2008) and Mintel (2009) reports who claimed females had more knowledge of HMs than males. Figure 5-2 The Migration of South Asians to the UK - What Migrants Took with Them and Challenges They faced in The UK Direct migration of South Asians to the UK Migration of South Asians around the world Migration of South Asians from around the world to the UK The diagram represents the migration pattern of South Asians to the UK which may have been direct from South Asia or from other parts of the world where South Asians moved to. It also summarises what migrants took from their native country and the challenges they faced in the UK. 202 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra A significant difference in knowledge of HMs was also identified amongst participants from the different age groups in this study (i.e. older participants had more knowledge than younger participants). Although younger participants may not have had as much knowledge of HMs in comparison to older participants, this may be due to a lack of experience which comes with age. Bhopal (1986a) predicted that the use of traditional medicines by young SAs would decline in the future as people became more familiar with Western medicines. The results of the SATMED survey identified that traditional HMs still play an important role in the lives of SAs of all ages in the UK. The results revealed that SAs participants of all ages use HMs to supplement and maintain their health, treat minor ailments, and manage side-effects caused by conventional Western medicines (CWM). It can be concluded from this research that traditional HMs still play an important role amongst SA communities in the UK as they are regarded as safe and effective and part of peoples' traditional heritage. The Retail Think Tank (2013) identified that Western supermarkets, health stores, and online retailers are now stocking ethnic ingredients to cater for migrant communities. This was echoed by participants in this investigation who said ingredients for HMs which in the past were personally brought from abroad were now becoming commercially accessible in the UK. Participants identified some HMs, ingredients, dried plant material, and seeds (e.g. tulsi) which were still personally imported to the UK from abroad, mainly from India, Pakistan, and parts of Africa (e.g. Kenya and Uganda). This added to the interest of authentication of plant species in HMs which was explored further in Chapter 4 (Objective 3). As tulsi was one of the most popular products participants claimed to grow, import, and use for religious and medicinal purposes it was selected as the plant to be used for molecular analysis. The use of HMs alongside CWM was also explored in the SATMED questionnaire, where SA participants (who can also be considered as patients) were asked about whether or not they shared the information about their use of HMs with their HCPs; 69% (n=73) of participants did not tell their doctor, while even more (82%, n=87) did not tell their pharmacist. Various reasons for not sharing information about the use of HMs with HCPs were noted including: the fear of being labelled as backwards or old fashioned, treated differently or not treated at all, HCPs not understanding problems patients presented with (i.e. due to language and cultural barriers), and not seeing their HCPs to be able to tell them. Similar results were disclosed by Eisenberg et al. (2001) where participants also reported feeling that HCPs did not understand them."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-24T13:48:11.029565Z","inner_id":33,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":34,"annotations":[{"id":39,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":1370,"end":1384,"text":"Ocimum

unregulated import of HMs, products, ingredients or seeds, to the UK carries risk of species substitution and adulteration which was demonstrated in the Tulsi Project. The molecular work conducted highlighted the usefulness of DNA analysis in authenticating plant species in HMs, and proved to be valuable technique for fast and efficient identification of the Ocimum species. The multi-disciplinary approach used to conduct this research has enabled the perspectives of SA communities and Western HCPs of HMs in the UK to be explored, as well as the use of DNA barcoding in ethnobotany; providing a unique contribution to ethnopharmacology. 211 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra References Abbot, N.C.

Brief description of proposed amendment 238 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra One of the objectives set in the initial proposal (version 3) was 'to gain an insight into healthcare professionals knowledge and understanding of traditional herbal medicines used in South Asian communities in the UK'. A questionnaire and Participant Information Leaflet (PIL) has now been created to fulfil this objective. The questionnaire has been designed to gain an insight into healthcare professionals' personal and professional opinions of traditional herbal medicines. The term healthcare professionals (HCPs) refers to those who have regular clinical contact with patients. The main focus for this study will be on General Practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists as they are at the frontline of dealing with minor health problems which may be treated with herbal medicines. In addition, for the purpose of this exploratory research other HCPs who may also have had opportunities to discuss herbal medicines with their patients will also be given the chance to participate (i.e. including nurses, dentists and opticians). The questionnaire will be administered as a postal questionnaire to GPs and Pharmacists across Birmingham and Leicester, whose addresses are readily available in the public domain (i.e. directories\/ the internet). Hence, the style of the PIL is similar to a cover letter. Survey monkey (an online survey software) will also be used to publish the same questionnaire online in anticipation of reaching more people and getting a larger response rate. An opportunity sampling technique will be employed as healthcare professionals known to the research team will be asked to participate and forward the link for the online survey to other healthcare professionals to complete. 10. Rationale for the amendment Page 6 of the ethics proposal highlighted that separate ethical approval will be sought at a later stage depending on the progress of the study. After assessing the progress of the study, it is now at a stage where this objective can be explored. 11. Please list each potential ethical issue relating to your study and state how these will be addressed: include potential risks to participants and research staff The Participant Information Leaflet (PIL) has been carefully worded to prevent harm being caused to participants. A PIL produced by the GPhC was used as a template to tailor this to healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals who use traditional herbal medicines may feel hesitant to share this information but anonymity and confidentiality will be assured. All postal questionnaires will be returned to De Montfort University and not the researchers personal address to ensure personal details of the researcher are kept safe. 239 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Appendix 2B HCPs Questionnaire Ethics Review Reply Re: Ethical Approval Application - Investigating the use and identity of traditional herbal remedies amongst South Asian communities using biomolecular techniques. (Ref: 1113) Reviewers comments: Applicants response: I was unable to find any information in the application paperwork about who is included in the definition 'healthcare professionals' and how they will be recruited. The proposal doesn't seem to have been extended from the original to include details about this section of the study - sample size, inclusion criteria, recruitment methods etc. so it is difficult to give an ethical opinion on the work to be completed. This links directly to the issue of NHS R&D approval. If the research is proposing to recruit NHS healthcare professionals, we might expect to gain this. I am assuming this is not the intention, but clarification needs to be sought on whether it is needed - dependent on the sample and the means of recruitment. We need an update on this specific phase of the study and clarification of whether NHS R&D approval is required. Clarification of Healthcare Professionals: The term healthcare professionals (HCPs) refers to those who have regular clinical contact with patients. The main focus for this study will be on General Practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists as they are at the frontline of dealing with minor health problems which may be treated with herbal medicines. In addition, for the purpose of this exploratory research other HCPs who may also have had opportunities to discuss herbal medicines with their patients will also be given the chance to participate (i.e. including nurses, dentists and opticians). Not only are we are looking for healthcare professionals who may have experience of discussing the use of herbal medicines with patients but we also want to know their personal views and opinions of herbal medicines. Recruitment methods: The postal questionnaire will only be sent to GP surgeries and pharmacies whose addresses are readily available in the public domain (i.e. directories\/ the internet). Once the target locations have been agreed (with supervisors) we will collate a list of address to post the questionnaires to. If ethical approval is granted I will seek advice from my supervisor (Prof. Mark Johnson) and DMU staff who have experience with this form of questionnaire distribution (e.g. Peter Rivers, Sandra Hall etc.). An online version of the questionnaire which will be published via Survey Monkey can be completed by any healthcare professional if they are interested in participating. An opportunity sampling technique will be employed as healthcare professionals known to the research team will be asked to participate and forward the link for the online survey to other healthcare professionals to complete. Sample size: There are no defined parameters for the sample size as this exploratory research is an open survey which will be running in the background while the main themes of the research are explored. The survey will be available online for a year, from the date of publishing the questionnaire, as this is the duration of the license we will purchase for the online survey software. Inclusion criteria: Participants must be over 18 years old so participants can consent for themselves. Participants must be a healthcare professional, either practicing or retired. The healthcare practitioner must have practiced in the UK at some point in their career (no specific time period). The rationale for posting questionnaires to GP surgeries and pharmacists is because these healthcare professionals are the first port of call in a community setting (i.e. primary care) who will deal with minor ailments which may often be treated with herbal medicines. Hence we are most interested in the views and opinions of GPs and 240 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra pharmacists. However, as this is an open survey with the intention to explore healthcare professional's views and opinions of herbal medicines anyone who is a healthcare professional and wishes to participate can do so. This is so we can get a variety of healthcare professional's views and opinions of herbal medicines. NHS R&D approval: Advice from several colleagues from DMU and external NHS ethics advisors has been useful in clarifying whether or not NHS R&D approval would be required. Including: Maggie Barrett - Senior RM&G Facilitator (Leicestershire, Northamptonshire & Rutland Comprehensive Local Research Network). Debbie Wall - Research & Development Manager, NHS Leicester City (awaiting a response). As we will not be using the NHS to recruit participants or conduct\/ host the research; we have no sponsors and will not require any patient details we would not require NHS ethical approval. I am currently working on completing the IRAS forms to get assurance from Debbie Wall to clarify this. 'Research involving staff as participants REC review is not normally required for research involving NHS or social care staff recruited as research participants by virtue of their professional role.' - See more at: http:\/\/www.hra.nhs.uk\/resources\/before-you-apply\/research-requiring-nhs-rd-review-but-not-ethical-review\/#sthash.QIjBvS5h.dpuf Exceptions to the need for REC review Subject to any overriding legal requirements, REC review is not required for the following types of research: -Research limited to the involvement of NHS or social care staff recruited as research participants by virtue of their professional role. - Research involving use of or access to a care organisation's premises or facilities, but not otherwise involving patients or service users. - See more at: http:\/\/www.hra.nhs.uk\/resources\/research-legislation-and-governance\/governance-arrangements-for-research-ethics-committees\/#sthash.LkrVSzts.dpuf In relation to ethical issues raised, the researcher has not indicated what they would do if a participant were to reveal dangerous or poor practice in this questionnaire. The questionnaire will be anonymous as we are not asking for any personal\/ identifiable details (for example registration\/ license details are not required). If dangerous practices were identified there would be no way of identifying the participant so we wouldn't be able to address them even if they were identified. The nature of this questionnaire has been designed with the intent of exploring the healthcare professionals' views and experience with herbal medicines, not their professional practice. 241 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Appendix 2C NHS R&D Approval Letter 06.05.2014 Study Ref: LCCR 200214 End Date: 31.03.2015 Project Status: Approved Dear Miss Sukvinder Bhamra Re: Investigating the use of traditional herbal remedies I am pleased to confirm that Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group which provides the Primary Care R&D Service across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland, has received a review of this research study via the Coordinated System for gaining NHS Permission (CSP) from the Clinical Research Network: East Midlands.

date for the project: Expected end date for the project: (FREC\/RCO must be advised upon completion) 01\/10\/2012 October 2016 Brief description of proposed activity and its objectives: The tulsi project has emerged as a satellite project, which has developed during the initial stages of my PhD. Extensive background research done suggests that this plant (Ocimum tenuiflorum) has multiple medicinal benefits, huge cultural significance and would be a great starting point to develop my biomolecular analytical skills. From this project we anticipate collecting a variety of tulsi samples from participants, whether it be tulsi seeds to grow in the growth room, leaves (fresh\/dry) or any other tulsi product which we can extract DNA from. These will be added to the current traditional herbal medicines inventory we have in the university. At the same time as collecting samples of tulsi we will ask participants a few questions, a semi-structured interview, about their tulsi. Questions will aim to gain an insight into where their tulsi is from, why it is kept, what it is used for and any other significant facts about the plant. Please see the attached proposal for further information*. *Please refer to the external memory device for the complete Tulsi Project Ethical Proposal 244 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Ethical issues identified: How these will be addressed: Confidentiality & anonymity. Responses will be coded with a reference number to protect participants' identity. No data will be identifiable once coded and analysed. Risk of causing distress to participants. Wording of questions will be considered carefully to prevent any adverse effects on participants. Informed consent. A participant information leaflet will be provided to all participants prior to the interview; this will enlighten participants as to what the research is about and enable them to give informed consent. Participants will have the freedom to withdraw at any point during the interview. Unauthorised access to data collected. Researcher will keep all data collected in a lockable cabinet, with restricted access. All data on computers and memory sticks will be password protected.

I will be exploring the use of traditional herbal remedies by South Asian diasporic communities in the UK. Nature has provided a pharmacy, which people have recognised and taken full advantage of. The knowledge of which plants are medicinally beneficial comes from the use of plants as food, trial and error, and now more commonly from scientific research. Many Western medicines available have been developed from natural sources; approximately 25% of medicines prescribed worldwide are derived from plants. The use of plants, herbs and spices to prevent and treat diseases goes back before written records were created and this continues to thrive today. As healthcare professionals we may be faced with many challenges; including the concurrent use of conventional western medicine and traditional herbal medicine. Is it safe or effective to consume herbs and spices for medicinal purposes? Have your say Here is the chance to share your views anonymously. Here is the opportunity to express your personal and professional opinions on traditional herbal medicines. Taking part The questionnaire is designed to explore UK based healthcare professionals' views and opinions on traditional herbal medicines. In order to participate all you have to do is answer a few questions, which will take no more than ten minutes. By completing the questionnaire you are consenting for the data to be analysed and published as part of my thesis, in academic journals and at conferences. Confidentiality All completed questionnaires will remain confidential as no unauthorised person will have access to the data. As no personal details are required the process ensures anonymity and there will be no way of identifying your responses. This study has been approved by the De Montfort University Ethics Committee and NHS Leicester City, Clinical Commissioning Group.

I am doing a PhD at De Montfort University in traditional Indian herbal medicine. I have a keen interest in tulsi, Holy basil, Ocimum tenuiflorum. Tulsi 'the queen of herbs' is one of India's most sacred herbs known for its divine healing properties. The tulsi plant holds a prestigious position in every Hindu household, as it represents the goddess Virinda Tulsi; a woman of immense purity and devotion to God. My aim is to explore the origins of tulsi, why people keep it in their homes, what they use it for and to collect a variety of samples for DNA analysis, to verify the genetics of the plant. I would also like to collect tulsi seeds to add to our current tulsi nursery. In order to participate in this research you must be over eighteen years old, you will need to answer some questions, which will take no more than fifteen minutes. By answering the questions you are consenting for the data to be analysed and published as part of my thesis. If you wish to withdraw from participation, you may choose to stop the interview at any point. If you have any tulsi products and are happy to give me a sample I only need a small amount. If you are happy to be contacted at a later date for further information please leave your name and contact details. All samples collected will be given a reference number so anonymity will be ensured throughout the process. All information disclosed will remain confidential as no unauthorised person will have access to the data.I hope you will enjoy this and thank you for participating in my research. .............................................................................................................. ........................................

Identification was based on a 100% match across the sequence length after the ends were trimmed to start and end at the same position (*some species identified according to the closest match on GenBank)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-22T09:50:38.703340Z","updated_at":"2024-04-26T08:11:24.298326Z","inner_id":41,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":42,"annotations":[{"id":41,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":443,"end":457,"text":"O.
