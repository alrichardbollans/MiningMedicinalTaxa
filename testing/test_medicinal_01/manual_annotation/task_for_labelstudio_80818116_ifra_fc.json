This herb is mostly produced for domestic or re-gional markets and its production in Europe is believed to be increasing in indoor settings, under the control of orga-nized crime groups. Usually, the authorities are faced with the problem of a lack of information on where the canna-bis was grown. This material is also widely consumed by the population in each country and therefore establishing of system for classifying the origin of this plant can be a challenge for the scientists and a great benefit for the po-lice authorities. When drugs are concerned and especially for the fo-rensic purposes, the most significant compounds in Canna-bis samples are cannabinoids, terpenophenolic compounds unique to cannabis. For the forensic practice, the most im-portant cannabinoids are: 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabidiol (CBD). The first compound, 9-THC is psychoactive component, while the other two mentioned cannabinoids are not. On the other, hand, transition metals are important for plant growth and they are distributed in different cells, in certain concen-trations due to the established homeostasis. Hemp has the ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals. Bearing in mind the lack of literature on possible correlations between content of cannabinoids in Cannabis plants and metals in both Cannabis samples and soil where the plants were cul-tivated, multivariate methods were applied aiming to assist in determination of origin of cannabis and its production. Materials and methodsYoung plants of Cannabis sativa species had been seized by the Police authorities as material planted by the criminal groups on different locations in Serbia. The plants were grown illegally under controlled indoor conditions by applying certain levels of temperature, humidity and inten-sity of light. The plants were randomly selected from the plantations in the early growing stage for the purpose of fo-rensic analyses. The rhizosphere soil from the root zone at a depth of 5-10 cm was sampled. The plant samples were further separated into roots, stems and leaves. The roots parts were cleaned from traces of soil, washed with de-ionised water and dried. The Cannabis leaves were dried and grounded to a powder. The mass of 33.3 mg of dried leaves material was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol, shak-en in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and filtered. The fil-trate was heated for 12 min at 150 degS in order to run decar-boxylation of the cannabinoid acids into cannabinoids. The evaporated extracts were reconstituted with 2 mL of meth-anol. The resulting solution of 1 uL, for each sample was applied on the TLC plate together with the volume of 1 uL of the dissolved reference materials: D9-THC, CBN and CBD in methanol in concentration of 0.05 mg\/mL and 1 uL of pure methanol. Mobile phase was n-hexane: diethyl ether in ratio 4 : 1. Visualization was conducted by the dis-solved Azoic Diazo Component in 0.1 M sodium hydrox-ide in water. In the second step, 20 mg of each sample were dis-solved in 5 mL methanol, shaken in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue was reconstituted with 2 mL of methanol. 1 uL of the re-sulting solution for each sample was injected into the GC-FID system in order to analyse the content of cannabinoids. S2 OP 56130Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 129 - 130 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsOral presentationsFor the purpose of elemental analysis, the sampled soils, roots, stems and leaves were subjected to microwave-as-sisted acid digestion, according to a known procedure (Ra-zic et al., 2006). The determination of the cannabinoids by thin lay-er chromatography (TLC) with plates made of aluminium and covered with silica gel with fluorescence indicator of UV254, by conducting the semi quantitative analyses.The determination of the cannabinoids was performed using an Agilent GC System, Model 7890A, fitted with a Flame Ionization Detector. The conditions were as fol-lows: column HP-5 (30 m x 320 um x 0.25 um), injection temperature: 250 degC, splitless mode, oven program: initial temperature 150 degC for 0 min, heating rate 15 degC\/min to 300 degC and held for 5 min, nitrogen flow rate: 46 mL\/min. The determination of the Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ca and Mg was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer Model 5000 atomic ab-sorption spectrophotometer, operated under optimized measurement (Razic et al., 2005). The determination of the Cr was accomplished using a Perkin-Elmer Model 5000 atomic absorption spectrophotometer with a graph-ite furnace HGA 400 Automatic Burner Control (Razic et al., 2006).Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and Minitab 13.20 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA), for Windows software packages. Results and discussionSince the roots contain only trace amounts of these sub-stances while the stems, branches and twigs have less than the leaf material, the cannabinoid content was measured only in the leaves. For the purpose of comparison of the can-nabinoid content in the young plants and the mature one the semi quantitative method of the TLC was conducted and the difference in the cannabinoids content was detected. The cannabinoids content in the leaves of the exam-ined cannabis plants was determined by external calibra-tion. The values varied from 0.03 to 1.47 mg\/mL for THC and from 0.11 to 1.12 mg\/mL for CBN. The lowest lev-els were from 0.003 to 0.06 mg\/mL for CBN, what is rea-sonable since the level of this cannabinoid, as degradation product of THC, increases with time during storage of can-nabis plants. Quantification of metals was performed by external cal-ibration. The accuracy of the methods was checked by anal-ysis of a standard reference material, NIST SRM 1547 - Peach Leaves and NIST SRM 2711 - Montana II Soil, when satisfactory recoveries (90.06 - 115.35%) were obtained.The objective of this study was to analyse the corre-lations of seven metals and three main cannabinoids us-ing multivariate methods of analysis. After preliminary tests (Ryan-Joiner and Grubbs tests) the concentration data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) in order to highlight any relations between the elements. Four principal components (PCs) appeared to account for 89.42% of the variance of the data. These factors are re-lated to the sources of the elements and cannabinoids in the studied samples. The first factor comprises Mn, THC and CBN with high loadings. A correlation like this indi-cates that they arise from the same sources. Fe and Cr show significant positive loadings in the second factor and are negatively correlated with Zn and CBD with high nega-tive loading. The third factor is dominantly loaded by Cu as an essential element; a constituent of co-enzymes im-portant for a plant cycle. It is also correlated with Mg, with a high but negative loading. These correlations led to the consideration of the biosynthesis of cannabinoids and the involvement of metals as cofactors in the enzymatic cata-lyzed synthesis cycles (De Meijer et al., 2002; Pate, 1994; Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al., 2014; Sirikantaramas et al., 2005; Taura et al., 2007).ConclusionThis work is conducted in order to determine whether the metals content in rhizosphere and cannabis can affect the levels of three important cannabinoids. The obtained results were subjected to chemometrics evaluation which gave an opportunity to get a better insight into role of met-als in the biosynthesis of cannabinoids. Identified patterns could be helpful in tracking the origin of Cannabis plant and its product adding a value to the applied analytical and chemometrics methods in forensic sciences.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* jelena@ff.ukim.edu.mkBackground Falsification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) has been recognized as an important health issue since a series of health scares involving large numbers of casualties happened when altered APIs escaped detection in routine analytical testing (Degardin et al., 2014). API falsification usually means discrepancy between the information for declared manufacturer and the actual manufacturer of the APIs used for manufacturing of fin-ished dosage forms (FDF). Any form of tampering the con-tent or information about the content might affect the qual-ity of an API and therefore constitutes a direct threat to the health of patients. Since the reason for any falsification is fast and easy money, there is no general rule what APIs can be subjected to falsification. For any substance that can bring economic benefits to the manufacturer \/ distributor there is a potential risk to be falsified. The conventional analytical approach often fails to de-tect falsification since the quality and quantity of the API is within the standards. Instead, methods that allow for dis-tinguishing API samples and determining the source of APIs suspected for falsification are needed. Alternative ap-proach must include broader analytical window using spe-cific techniques to reveal some characteristic analytical in-formation, such as impurity profile, spectral data, physico-chemical constants, etc., thus creating an 'API fingerprint' database. APIs can be characterized, compared and clas-sified based on features revealed from such 'fingerprints', using chemometric methods, like different pattern recog-nition techniques (PRT) (Acevska et al., 2015; Petrusevs-ki et al., 2015).The aim of this research was to give an overview of analytical and chemometric methods used to differentiate the origin of the samples based on a 'fingerprint' database by the discriminatory matching of specific analytical fea-tures of the specific API.API fingerprinting API fingerprinting is the common name of a group of analytical applications for detection, identification and quantitative determination of related substances and oth-er impurities. Impurity profiling (organic, inorganic im-purities, residual solvents, enantiomeric purity), chemi-cal characterization (polymorphism\/solvatomorphism) and other contaminants (radioactivity) of the APIs requires ad-vanced and robust fingerprint method. It usually comprise a set of several highly specific techniques, like: liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer (LC\/MS, GC\/MS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), & differential termogravimetric analysis (TG\/DTG), Furrier-transformed infrared (FTIR), near infrared (NIR), Raman or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR); in-ductively coupled plasma combined with optical emission (ICP-OES) or mass spectrometry (ICP\/MS), X-ray diffrac-tion (XRD) etc. The characteristic and reproducible chemi-cal features revealed during the API fingerprinting are used for discriminating between samples. This data highlights the API fingerprinting as core activity in modern drug anal-ysis and tool for getting reliable results for combating API falsification. Pattern recognition of API fingerprintsPattern recognition techniques that can be applied to API fingerprinting consist of two general areas; unsuper-vised or supervised. From the characterization of the sam-ples of known origin, predictive models can be built and S2 OP 57132Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 131 - 132 (2016)Oral presentationsPharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairstested with new samples of unknown composition. By de-termination of different origins of the APIs, their falsifica-tion can be detected.In unsupervised pattern recognition (hierarchical clus-ter analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), generally viewed as exploratory data analysis methods, from which natural clusters in the data set can be identi-fied, no knowledge concerning the origin of the samples is necessary. HCA gives no indication of the variables which contribute most to the classification of objects in the data set, unlike PCA, where the loadings indicate the variation contained within each variable. There may be a loss of in-formation in the dendrogram generated by HCA, especial-ly if clusters are not well resolved. However, HCA does present all the variation in the data set, in contrast to PCA where only a percentage of the variation is typically pre-sented (Adams, 2004).In supervised pattern recognition (classification and discriminant analysis (CDA), orthogonal partial least square regression (OPLS\/O2PLS), soft independent mod-eling of class analogy (SIMCA), etc. ), the groupings of samples must be known to allow predictions to take place. These methods require prior knowledge of the sample ori-gin to develop models, which are subsequently used to as-sign unknown samples to a parent group. The OPLS-DA method is well suited for classification of data that have multi-collinear and noisy variables, which is common for many types of chemical data. Refined properties of the OPLS-DA methodology have illustrated how Y-orthogo-nal variation can be useful not only for evaluation, but also for classification, thus rendering a PLS-DA\/SIMCA hybrid discriminatory model (Bylesjo et al., 2006).Validation of the classification method The outcome of the investigation on API falsification should be accurate and reliable. For sample authentica-tion purposes, it is essential to ensure that their affiliation is properly defined (Gonzalez, 2007). In other words, de-tection of false negatives (excluding sample that belongs to the class) and false positive (includes a sample that does not belong to the class) results must be enabled."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2,"annotations":[{"id":2,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":7023,"end":7039,"text":"Candida albicans","labels":["Scientific Fungus Name"]},"id":"8UmBfUl050","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7055,"end":7079,"text":"Aspergillus brasiliensis","labels":["Scientific Fungus Name"]},"id":"uSbYDhAwDG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":9898,"end":9909,"text":"C. albicans","labels":["Scientific Fungus Name"]},"id":"F-PHccipwh","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":10126,"end":10141,"text":"A. brasiliensis","labels":["Scientific Fungus Name"]},"id":"8IIAbL0WsY","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":13805,"end":13813,"text":"headache","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"qNTMdgYVRq","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":13818,"end":13822,"text":"pain","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"JssALchBH_","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":13936,"end":13944,"text":"migraine","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"S5O-pU73Lv","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.214626Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:16:38.020745Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":21606.274000000005,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"ec913829-69fe-431b-9e90-8cab75f07b3a","import_id":2,"last_action":null,"task":2,"project":8,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"099b3cd5-ifra_reviewed_all.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"For investigations of failures or action levels, a specific method is usually preferable.For the swab sampling method it is necessary to deter-mine: the percent recovered with the swab extraction pro-cedure; the effectiveness of the swab at recovering residues from equipment parts surface and the interference of swab materials in the analysis.For the rinse sampling method it is necessary to deter-mine: the percent recovered with the rinse solution extrac-tion procedure; the effectiveness of the rinse solution at re-covering residues from equipment parts surfaces and the interference of the rinse solution in the cleaning procedure and analysis; a correction for recovery efficiency in calcu-lations for acceptable residue levels.The percentage of recovery is important because it will be applied when evaluating the final concentration of residuals.All equipment that comes in contact directly with raw ma-terial -intermediate as well as final product - must be included, because of its potential to act as a possible source for microbi-ological contamination.

The results are reported in Quality Assurance Department and the Quality Assurance Manager will give final approval to the reviewed results by signing the final Report (Haider and Asif, 2010b). Validated cleaning process must be subject to change control. Further, revalidation is necessary in order to main-tain the validated status where a differentiation must be made between change-related and periodic revalidation. An effi-cient change control procedure must ensure that the effect of changes on the cleaning validation is identified and that any necessary follow-up action is initiated. Checks must be car-ried-out to verify whether revalidation is necessary follow-ing changes to the cleaning procedure, production equipment and products. A suitable time interval must be determined for the periodic revalidation. Implementation may be stream-lined by linking this to the change control procedure and by reducing the scope of the validation based on a review of data and documents (Borchert and Gomez, 2011b).ConclusionCleaning procedures should be suitable for their in-tended purpose. This should be confirmed by the success-ful execution of a cleaning validation study. The clean-ing validation must ensure that the quality of the product produced using specified equipment is not influenced by cross-contamination from the previous product, cleaning agent's residues or microorganisms.ReferencesBorchert, D., Gomez, R., 2011a.

D., Blvd. A. Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* anosacheva@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionMost people nowadays suffer from problems with the gastrointestinal tract and indigestion. Gastroguard chew-able tablets are a pharmaceutical solid dosage form from the group of antacids, which contains 680 mg calcium car-bonate and 80 mg magnesium carbonate. Its effect is to act locally and neutralize the gastric acid in the stomach, not depending on the systemic absorption. Therefore it al-leviates the symptoms caused by indigestion and releases the feeling of bloating. The carbonate salts react with the gastric acid in the stomach developing water and miner-al salts as products (http:\/\/www.alkaloid.com.mk\/vademe-cum-step-2.nspx?LekTipId=150). Every pharmaceutical product must be subjected to chemical and microbiological analysis before the batch release. Those analyses are under the jurisdiction of the Quality Control department. In addition to the microbio-logical analysis a working method for determination of the microbiological purity in this pharmaceutical solid form, which would be used in the routine, must be validated. For pharmaceutical solid forms the parameters that should be tested are Total Aerobic Microbial Count (TAMC), Total Yeasts and Molds Count (TYMC) and absence of Esche-richia coli (Ph.Eur., 2013; USP, 2014).The aim of this work is to validate the analytical meth-od which would be used in the routine work for determina-tion of the microbiological purity of Gastoguard chewable tablets as part of the quality control of the product before releasing of the batch. The method should be simple for manipulation and in compliance with the current Europe-an Pharmacopeia. The validation of the method was made by the microbiological team of the Quality Control depart-ment of Alkaloid AD.Materials and methodMaterialsDuring validation of the method standard laborato-ry equipment was used: Laminar flow Class II, Incubators Gallencamp on 20-25 oC; 30-35 oC and 42-44 oC, Bunsen burner, Vortex, glass pipetes, glass tubes intended for mi-crobiological use. In addition to validate the method 10g of Gastoguard chewable tablets were weighted using Sartori-us analytical scale. Buffered sodium chloride peptone wa-ter pH 7 was utilized as medium for dissolving of the sam-ple and for making the dilutions of the culture suspensions. Ready to use nutrient media from BioMerieux were used. 90 mm Petri dishes from Trypcase Soy agar, Sabouraud Dextrose agar and Mac Conkey agar and 100 mL Trypcase Soy broth and 100 mL Mac Conkey broth of the liquid me-dia were used for manipulation.The test microorganisms that were part of this val-idation were the standard microorganisms recommend-ed by the current European Pharmacopeia for the meth-od suitability test. Those are: Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 (Ph.Eur., 2013).Method For determination of the antimicrobial activity and validation of the test method challenge test with the above mentioned microorganisms were used and the microbio-logical method of choice was the surface-spread method and direct inoculation in the liquid media for the test of ab-sence of Escherichia coli.

The acceptability factor in this test is 0.92. The acceptability factors for all the used microorgan-isms were in the compatibility framework and they never exceed the value 2.In the test for absence of E. coli, there was good visible growth in Trypcase Soy broth after 24h and in Mac Conkey broth the growth was followed by a change of color of the medium. There was also presence of red non-mucous colo-nies on Mac Conkey agar after 24h.The growth promotion test of the used media showed that they are adequate for routine microbiological analysis.Conclusion Gastoguard chewable tablets do not have antimicrobi-al activity against the used test microorganisms.The method suitability test of the product revealed that the routine microbiological analysis should be performed with surface-spread method from 1:10 dilution for TAMC and TYMC and the method of direct inoculation in the test for absence of E. coli.

It is considered to be one of the most commonly consumed drugs with more than 80 percent of the world's population consuming caffeine daily. The Europeans are found to be the world's largest consumers of caffeine in-take of approximately 4.6 kg\/person\/year (Norton et al., 2014). The presence of the pharmaceutical residues in the environment has become the subject of growing concern in the past decade. Due to the continuous input that leads to the long-term adverse effects on the aquatic and terres-trial organisms, the special attention is being paid to their concentration levels in the aquatic environment. Caffeine can be found in traces in surface water. The main paths for caffeine to enter wastewater stream are either in urine or when caffeine-containing products are discharged through household pipelines or sewers. Determination of caffeine in surface water is an important task for environmental re-searches and analysis because it is found to be a good in-dicator for human sewage because of its relatively high concentrations in surface water and its unambiguous an-thropogenic origin. Other important usage of caffeine is as an analgesic adjuvant in drug formulations for the treat-ment of headache and pain related to postpartum, postop-erative, and dental surgery and it is therapeutically applied for the treatment of migraine in combination with other drugs such as aspirin, paracetamol and tramadol. Caffeine is claimed to enhance the efficacy of these drugs (Madhu-sudhan, 2013). The goals of this study were to develop and validate high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for caffeine determination in food, beverages, sur-face water and drugs which is simple and easy to perform. This method could have a widespread application in food, environmental and pharmaceutical sciences.Materials and methodsSamples for caffeine determination in food and bever-ages were purchased at the Serbian market, samples of sur-face water were collected in amber bottles from seven rep-resentative locations of the Danube River on the territory of Novi Sad, Serbia, and tablets of analgoantipyretics con-taining caffeine were purchased from pharmacies in the vi-cinity of Novi Sad, Serbia. Caffeine from all samples was separated by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by HPLC. The chromatography was using two-solvent isocratic elu-tion. The HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) model Agi-lent HP 1100 system equipped with an autosampler (Wald-bronn, Germany) was used. The analytical column was the Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, i.d., 5 um particle size). Mobile phase was water-THF (0.1% THF in water adjusted to pH 8 with 0.1 M NaOH) - acetonitrile (90:10) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL\/min. The HPLC mobile phase was prepared fresh daily and filtered through a 0.45 um nylon filter. Run time was 10 min, column temperature 25 degC and analytes were detected at 273 nm.Results and discussionThe linearity between caffeine concentrations and the response was tested for concentration levels ranging from (0.010-100) mg\/L. High value of coefficient of correlation r=1 showed an excellent correlation between concentra-tions and peak areas. Calculated limit of detection (LOD-3.3*s\/S) and quantification (LOQ-10*s\/S) were 0.007 mg\/L and 0.012 mg\/L, respectively. According to the re-S2 OP 61140Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 139 - 140 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsOral presentationscovery values of (98.33-100.22)% the method showed ac-ceptable accuracy. Repeatability of the method was test-ed by analyzing three different concentrations of caffeine standards in six repetitions. The relative standard devia-tions (RSD) ranged from 0.028% to 0.063% for retention time and from 0.015% to 0.65% for peak area showing ex-cellent repeatability."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:16:38.134358Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3,"annotations":[{"id":3,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3842,"end":3854,"text":"antioxidants","labels":["Medicinal

were no interferences in the HPLC results by impurities or matrix in tested samples, which indicate that developed method, had very good se-lectivity.The results of caffeine content in food and beverag-es showed that it ranged 5.6-158 mg\/100 g in food sam-ples, 24.71-30.81 mg\/100 ml in commercial tea samples, 1328-3594 mg\/100 g in coffees and 9.69-30.79 mg\/100 ml in energy drinks. Also, obtained values in this study were consistent with the available manufacturer data. Analyz-ing surface water samples for caffeine, significant concen-trations were found at the sampling sites near the waste-water discharges. Mean caffeine concentrations for sum-mer, fall, winter and spring periods were 24.78 ng\/L, 26.83 ng\/L, 24.61 ng\/L, and 86.29 ng\/L, respectively. The high-est mean caffeine concentration was detected in samples collected in the spring period which is in an agreement with the literature (Fernandez et al., 2010). The caffeine content in combined non-narcotic analgoantipiretics varied from (96.48-100.74)% of the declared value. The require-ments of the British Pharmacopoeia include (95-105)% of active drug content. According to obtained data it can be concluded that all brands did meet this specification in the HPLC assay method.ConclusionIn this work a unique and simple to perform HPLC method was established for caffeine content determina-tion in food, beverages, surface water and analgoantipiret-ics. Obtained data for accuracy, repeatability, selectivity and robustness confirmed that the proposed method could be used for routine control of caffeine content in differ-ent mixtures. The results of food and beverages analysis showed that caffeine content was consistent with the avail-able manufacturer data and obtained data for combined commercial formulations of non-narcotic analgoantipiret-ics of all brands did meet specification of the British Phar-macopoeia for active drug content. Testing the surface wa-ter samples for caffeine showed that significant concentra-tions were found at the sampling sites near the wastewater discharges.

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that ex-ists in eight different forms, among them, a-tocopherol is the most active form in humans. Vitamin E is very popular cosmetic ingredient. It acts as antioxidant to protect cells against free radicals and reduces oxidative stress. Ultravio-let light and environmental pollutants are known initiators of free radicals and skin damage. Topical antioxidants have the potential to diminish the reactive oxygen species gen-erated from the UVA radiation. For that reason, there is an increasing interest in the incorporation of vitamins and an-tioxidants in skin care products (Lupo, 2001).The stability of the vitamin E in the cosmetic formu-lations and when applied to the skin is low. When exposed to UV light, it forms a-tocopheroxyl radicals that consume other antioxidants for recycling. For better stability, vita-min E is commonly used as a biologically non-active ester-ified form, such as tocopheryl acetate (Shapiro and Saliou, 2001). Vitamin E esters act as a pro-drug since they are hy-drolyzed to the active vitamin E (a-tocopherol) upon pen-etration into skin. However, there is conflicting evidence as to what extent this conversion actually takes place in the skin and many studies have shown that these substi-tutes have very low biological activity. While numerous topical skin care products claim to contain ''vitamin E'', these products may actually contain very different concen-trations and forms including active vitamin E, its several esters and many other derivatives (Thiele and Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage, 2007).The solid and emulsified cosmetic products must be carefully prepared for any of instrumental techniques which would be employed in the tocopherol analysis. The aim of this study was to develop an effective solid-phase extraction procedure for the HPLC determination of a-tocopheryl acetate, which could be important for assess-ment the content of this synthetic form of vitamin E in sun-screen lotions and creams. Materials and methodsMaterialsMethanol, ethanol and acetonitrile used in this work were of HPLC grade (J.T.Baker). a-tocopheryl acetate (TA) of analytical grade was obtained from Fluka (Fluka-Analytical BioChemika). Stock solution of 1.03 mg\/mL was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amounts of the a-tocopheryl acetate in absolute ethanol. Two sets of cali-bration standards were prepared by diluting aliquots of the stock solution.Cosmetic productsCommercial sunscreen products were purchased from a local cosmetic shop. Formulations under study were Pro-ducer 1-Sun Lotion SPF 30 and Producer 2-Sunscreen cream SPF 50. According to the product label, both formu-lations contained vitamin E only in the form of tocopheryl acetate and TA content was not exactly declared.Sample preparationA 0.5 g of the formulation was measured in 20 ml plas-tic volumetric container and 0.5 mL of 0.5% ascorbic acid was added. The emulsion was dissolved by vortex-mixing with 5 mL of ethanol. After centrifugation for 10 min, a 3 mL of the supernatant was pipetted and applied to the SPE column.SPE conditionsSolid phase extraction was performed on Chromabond C18ec cartridges (1ml\/100mg, Macherey-Nagel, GmbH, Duren, Germany), which was previously selected among S2 PP 62142Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 141 - 142 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsfive cartridges with different sorbent type. Cartridges were conditioned with 1mL of deionized water, followed by 1mL of methanol and 1mL of acetonitrile. After the sam-ple was aspirated through the cartridge, analyte elution was made by 2 x 1 mL of methanol.HPLC conditionsThe Agilent Technologies 1200 Series apparatus with DAD and FL detection was used for the analysis. Sepa-ration was performed on the Restek Ultra IBD C18 col-umn (150 mm x 3 mm, 3 mm). UV detector was set at 220 nm and 295 nm. Based on our previous work, 100% ace-tonitrile was selected as the optimal mobile phase (Sunaric et al., 2012). The column temperature was maintained at 40degC and the flow rate was kept at 0.45 ml\/min.Results and discussionTocopheryl acetate in extracted samples of the sun-screen formulations was identified by comparing the re-tention time of the observed chromatographic peak with that of the standard. Recovery of the solid-phase extrac-tion method was calculated by comparison of the TA peak area for extracted and non-extracted standard TA solution on five different cartridges. The obtained recovery value was higher than 85% for Chromabond C18ec, therefore this cartridge was selected for further analysis. Addition-ally, the cartridge selection was confirmed by extraction of the real samples supernatants obtained in sample prepa-ration procedure for the examined cosmetics. Even in this case, the highest chromatographic peak area of TA was ob-tained on Chromabond C18ec cartridge. The calibration curves for two concentration ranges, 0.2 mg\/mL - 2.0 mg\/mL and 0.1 mg\/mL - 1.0 mg\/mL with the correlation coefficients > 0.998 were constructed and applied for the determination of TA in the injected samples. Final tocopheryl acetate content found in the examined formulations was as follows: (200+-15) mg\/100g (0.2%) in Producer 1-Sun Lotion SPF 30 and (490+-20) mg\/100g (0.49%) in Producer 2-sunscreen cream SPF 50. These re-sults are in agreement with those given by other authors, that TA content is from 0.1% to 1% (Shapiro and Saliou, 2001; Thiele and Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage, 2007). As was expected, much higher content of TA was found in the formulation with a higher SPF level.ConclusionCosmetic formulations contain a high number of in-gredients and the analysis often requires extensive pre-treatments. A SPE method followed by HPLC determina-tion has been developed for the analysis of tocopheryl ace-tate in cosmetics. For the present experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the proposed extraction method was appropriate for the determination of TA in sunscreen lotion and cream. The extraction procedure was efficient, showing good accuracy and precision. Proposed analytical procedure for TA determination can be useful tool to know the amount of this synthetic form of vitamin E in cosmet-ic products.

D, Blvd. Aleksandar Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* szlatanovic@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionNon-sterile drugs must satisfy the appropriate microbi-ological purity criteria which are included in monographs in pharmacopoeias. Pharmacopoeial studies are prepared specifically to ensure that the medicinal product is thera-peutically effective and safe for the patient.Caffetin Cold is a combined medicinal product, con-taining several active ingredients: paracetamol (500 mg), pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (30 mg), dextrometho-rphan hydrobromide (15 mg) and ascorbic acid (60 mg). Paracetamol is a pain reliever and reduces body tempera-ture. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride decreases nasal con-gestion, allowing nasal and respiratory passages to open up. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide suppress cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation. Ascorbic acid (Vi-tamin C) fortifies the immune system (www.alkaloid.com.mk\/vademecum-step-2.nspx?LekTipId=64). The importance of determination of microbiological purity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in solid forms comes from the fact that the final product must com-ply with the criteria for microbiological purity.Objective: Validation of analytical method for deter-mination of microbiological purity of paracetamol, pseu-doephedrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobro-mide and ascorbic acid in the composition of Caffetin cold tablets. This method further should be used for routine de-termination of microbiological purity of APIs in Caffetin cold tablets. The method should be simple for manipula-tion and in compliance with the current edition of Europe-an Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur., 2013).Materials and methodsMaterialsStandard laboratory equipment was used. Buffered so-dium chloride peptone solution pH 7.0 was used as medi-um for dissolving of the sample and for making the dilu-tions of the culture suspensions.Ready to use nutrient media from BioMerieux(r) (69280 Marcy-l'Etoile-France) 90 mm Petri dishes of Trypcase Soy agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar were used.Standard test microorganisms recommended by the current Ph.Eur. for the method suitability test: Escherichia Coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergil-lus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 were used for challenge test.MethodsSurface-spread method and determination of antimi-crobial activity of APIs in Caffetin cold tablets was used. The number of all test microorganisms applied in the chal-lenge tests was less than 100 cfu\/ml. Each application was made in duplicate and the temperature and time of incu-bation depended of the type of the medium. Trypcase Soy agar was incubated for five days at a temperature from 30-35 @C, Sabouraud Dextrose agar was incubated for 7 days at a temperature from 20-25 @C. After the incubation time, the relation between the number of the each test microor-ganism dissolved in buffered sodium chloride pepton solu-tion pH 7.0, and the number of that test microorganism in the presence of the product was calculated. When verifying the suitability of the plate-count meth-S2 PP 63144Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 143 - 144 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsod, a mean of any of the test organisms not differing by a factor greater than 2 must be obtained (Clontz, 2009; Ph.Eur. 2013; USP, 2014).Results and discussion Microbiological purity was determined with direct application on the nutrient medium with surface-spread method. Results for paracetamol (1:10) showed that acceptabil-ity factor is 0.93 when Escherichia coli was used, 1.35 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.97 for Staphylococcus aure-uss and 1.05 for Bacillus spizizenii.

The reliability of the method is remarkably dependent upon the timely recognition of all factors that may generate erroneus resuts once the validated method is applied in practice. Therefore the scientific approach in course of LC-MS\/MS bioanalytical method development should involve risk analysis. The risk analysis denotes as-sessment of all critical steps (factors) that may affect the accuracy and ruggedness of the method. Matrix effect, me-tabolite interference, stability of the analyte and the selec-tion of an adequate regression model are identified as most common sources of method imprecision (Mulvana, 2010). Assessment of critical steps in bioanalytical method developmentMatrix effect (ME) is directly related to the sample clean-up procedure, thus selecting the optimal extraction procedure plays a crucial role for ensuring data quality in LC-MS\/MS bioanalysis (Chambers et al., 2007). Different types of extraction procedures, depending on the analyte, exhibit different extraction recoveries and ME. Therefore testing out various extraction procedures should become inevitable part of the contemporary bioanalytical meth-od development. The implementation of Quality by de-sign, as a new trend, enables shortening the time needed for the optimization of the sample preparation procedure. Until recently, the optimal extraction procedure was cho-sen only upon the extraction recovery. However, consider-ing the LC-MS\/MS analysis, the cleanliness of the extract, expressed through ME, obtained with different extraction procedures gains paramount importance. The EMA vali-dation guideline (EMA, 2011) recommends evaluation of the variability of the internal standard (IS)-normalized ME. However, it is more rational to assesses the degree of the absolute ME itself and not just the variability of the IS-nor-malized ME. This derives from the fact that the IS-normal-ized ME indicates that ME is consistent and not affected by the different lots of biological material. On the other hand, the absolute ME points out to the cleanliness of the ex-tracts (Nakov et al., 2015). Hence, it becomes evident that the selection of the sample preparation procedure should be based on the absolute ME and the extraction recovery should be put in second place, especially when problems related to the sensitivity of the method are not expected. The quantitative acceptance criteria applied in bioan-alytical validation guidelines (EMA, 2011; FDA, 2001) rely on data generated using quality control (QC) samples. However the QC samples do not contain phase I and II me-tabolites of the analyte of interest and therefore may be un-reliable model for real study samples. These metabolites are usually not stable and they can convert back to their parent drug in the mass spectrometer (in source back-con-version) and\/or during sample preparation (in vitro back-conversion), jeopardizing the accuracy of the bioanalyti-cal method (Wenkui et al., 2011). Therefore the assessment of the possibility of metabolite back-conversion prior the method validation becomes a crucial part of risk analysis. The first step includes assessment of the in source back-conversion through the verification of the chromatographic separation between the analyte and its metabolite. This is especially important for high throughput LC-MS\/MS anal-ysis, where chromatographic separation between the ana-lyte and the metabolite can be compromised, resulting in overestimated measurements. In case of this type of inter-S2 PP 64146Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 145 - 146 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsference, optimization\/modification of the ion source pa-rameters and\/or the chromatographic conditions should be applied. The metabolite back-conversion could also occur during the different steps of the sample preparation pro-cess, so second step involves investigation whether the proposed extraction procedure leads to metabolite back-conversion. For that purpose the optimized extraction pro-cedure should be applied on samples containing only the metabolite standard and the amount of analyte generated by metabolite back-conversion is then computed. In case of unavailability of metabolite standards, stability exper-iments under different storage conditions using real sam-ples could be applied as well (Jemal et al., 2010). The investigation of the sample stability in course of method development helps to avoid stability related prob-lems that may latter appear during the validation and appli-cation of the method. Although various sources may affect the sample stability, the focus within this paper is placed on chiral interconversion. All chiral compounds may undergo in vitro R\/S conversion occurring at physiological pH and temperature or under extreme pH and elevated temperature (Briscoe and Hage, 2009). Therefore the assessment of the possibility of R\/S interconversion during the overall ana-lytical procedure should be an integral part for every enan-tioselective method development, thus allowing quantifi-cation of the extent of in vivo interconversion without bias.The selection of an adequate regression model is the basis for accurate and reproducible quantification over the whole concentration range (Rozet et al., 2011). Most bio-analytical methods usually have wide concentration range, so heteroscedasticity of the data may be expected. In the above instance weighted linear or quadratic regression models should be applied. The recommendation of the reg-ulatory agencies (EMA, 2011; FDA 2001) is that the sim-plest model that adequately describes data should be used and the selection of more complex model should be jus-tified. Therefore the use of statistical approach based on non-parametric statistical tests (Nakov et al., 2014; Singto-roj et al., 2006) during the selection of the regression mod-el will provide justification of the choice of the adequate regression model, and will enable accurate quantification in whole calibration range.SummaryThe implementation of risk analysis during the LC-MS\/MS bioanalytical method development is longer last-ing process compared to conventional method develop-ment. However the timely perceiving and assessment of the critical steps generates highly reliable bioanalytical methods and lowers the possibility of late discovery of un-expected problems than often lead to method re-optimiza-tion and revalidation.ReferencesBriscoe, C.J., Hage, D.S., 2009.

Macedonia* Hadzievam@yahoo.comIntroductionForced degradation studies provide data to support identification of possible degradants; degradation path-ways and intrinsic stability of the drug molecule and vali-dation of stability indicating analytical procedures (Singh and Bakshi, 2002). Although most of the literature de-fines the concept of forced degradation, they do not pro-vide detailed information about a forced degradation strat-egy (Klick et al., 2005) and the experimental conditions to conduct forced degradation are described in a general way (Singh and Bakshi, 2000) without description of the exact stress conditions to be applied. Generally, a trial and error approach is adopted to select the strength, temperature and time of exposure to achieve loss of active substance from 10-30% (ICH, 2003; Singh and Bakshi, 2000). Such approach involves consid-erable cost, time consumption and scientific expertise and there is high incidence of random results. Therefore a need for more systematic approach is recognized (Dolan, 2002).A contemporary approach in the field of forced degra-dation is to evaluate correlation of degradation parameters by applying the concept of design of experiment (DoE). In turn, this can help studying the combination of conditions where optimal enrichment of degradation products is ob-tained. The basic concept of factorial design is performing an experiment in which all the possible combinations of fac-tors and levels are investigated (Lundstedt et al., 1988).Literature review reveals the implementation of DoE and factorial design concepts for optimization of forced degradation conditions (Kurmi et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2013; Sonawane and Gide., 2011), but no report exists on application of DoE for simvastatin (SIM) as model drug.The aim of this study was to develop stability-indicat-ing LC-MS method for quantification of SIM and its im-purities, and also, an attempt was made to simplify forced degradation studies by adopting DoE concept.Materials and methodsSimvastatin (SIM) samples with Certificate of Suit-ability to the monographs of the European Pharmacopoia (CEP) were used. Simvastatin CRS and Simvastatin for peak identification were provided by the EDQM (Stras-bourg, France). All reagents used were of analytical grade.Experiments were made on Dionex UltiMate(tm) 3000 (Thermo Scientific), interfaced with mass spectrometer with an electrosparay-ionization source, operated in neg-ative mode. Mass parameters were optimized as follows: Ion source heater temperature was set at 350 degC; capillary temperature at 300 degC; capillary voltage was 10 V with collision energy 35 eV. The separation was performed on Poroshell 120 EC C18 (Agilent Technologies, USA), 50 x 3.0 mm, 2.7 mm, using buffer (10 mM ammonium format, pH 4.0) and acetonitrile as a mobile phase in a gradient mode. The column temperature was 40 degC. Flow rate was 0.5 mL\/min. Injection volume was 5 mL. UV detection was performed at 238 nm. SIM was subjected to stress under acidic, alkaline, ox-idative, thermal and photolytic conditions. Variables, cho-sen from previously conducted initial experiments were: time of exposure, temperature and stressor strength. The forced degradation experiments set-up on the basis of 2n full factorial design were performed and the obtained re-sults from LC-MS samples were analyzed by Design Ex-S2 PP 65148Maced. pharm.

The last one was dominant fraction in both species (65.25% in nuts of Pinus peuce and 58.65% in nuts of Pinus nigra), while the fraction of saturated and monounsaturat-ed fatty acids were present in smaller amount (7.15% and 26.10% in Pinus peuce and 14.70% and 25.56% in Pinus nigra, respectively). Total of 21 fatty acids were identified in the investigat-ed oil samples isolated from Pinus peuce nuts which rep-resented 97.79% of total oil. The most abundant fatty acids were linoleic acid (61.95%) which is classified as polyun-saturated o-6 fatty acid and oleic acid (24.98%) known as monounsaturated o-9 fatty acid. Palmitic acid (3.51%) was dominant in the class of saturated fatty acids. Similarly 28 fatty acids were identified in the oil samples isolated from nuts of Pinus nigra which represented 98.60% of total oil. Predominant fatty acids were the same linoleic (54.81%), oleic (22.80%) and palmitic acid (9.07%).In terms of data concerning the chemical composi-tion of oil isolated from pine nuts, only one study could be found regarding chemical composition of fatty oil isolated from black pine or Pinus nigra but still there is no avail-able published data about the composition of oil obtained from nuts of Pinus peuce or Macedonian pine. According Bagci and Karaagacli (2004), the oil isolated from nuts of black pine from Turkey contains linoleic (47.10%), oleic (17.80%) and palmitic acid (4.70%) as major constituents what correlates to our findings.ConclusionSummarizing the obtained results, it is evident that pine nuts collected from Macedonian species are rich in oil that contain significant amount of unsaturated o-6 as well as o-9 fatty acids thus could be considered as their potential source. Moreover further investigations of chem-ical composition should be made in order to provide more data for their possible medicinal, pharmaceutical or com-mercial utilization.ReferencesAlbert, C.M., Gaziano, J.M., Willett, W.C., Manson, J.E., 2002.

They are organic bases with aliphatic (putres-cine (Put), cadaverine (Cad), spermine (Spm), spermidine (Spd)), aromatic (tyramine (Tyr), phenylethylamine (Phe)) or heterocyclic (histamine (His), tryptamine (Trp)) struc-tures, can be classified as monoamines (Phe and Tyr), di-amines (His, Cad, Put) or such as volatile (Phe) and non-volatile (His, Cad, Put, Tyr, Spm, agmatine (Agm), Trp) biogenic amines. The main factors for formation of bio-genic amines in foods or fermented foods are following: the availability of free amino acids, the existence of de-carboxylase positive microorganisms and the presence of suitable pre-conditions that allow bacterial growth. Pres-ent in higher concentration in foods, poses health risk for sensitive peoples and are cause for a number of adverse ef-fects on human health such as rash, edema, headache, ur-ticaria, rhinitis, respiratory and digestive problems (Lade-ro et al., 2010). Some pharmacological effects of biogen-ic amines which have appropriate precursors are: liberates adrenaline and noradrenaline, stimulates both sensory and motor neurons, controls gastric acid secretion (histamine); increases the cardiac output, causes lacrimation and saliva-tion, increases respiration (tyramine); hypotension, depre-ciation of the wine aroma, potentiate the toxicity of other amines (putrescine and cadaverine); releases noradrenaline from the sympathetic nervous system, increases the blood pressure, causes migraine (phenylethylamine) etc. (EFSA, 2011; Shalabi, 1996). During wine production biogenic amines are already present in must obtained from sunny or rotten grape, be-cause from vineyard it is not possible to get grape which will be free of biogenic amines (Gloria et al., 1998). Addi-tionally the biogenic amines are accumulated during fer-mentation, from yeast (alcoholic fermentation) or bacteria (malolactic fermentation) or from other naturally present microorganisms. According to that, the wines where the amino acids are present are ideal environment for produc-tion of biogenic amines. The negative influence of biogen-ic amines on human health is the reason why the world with high velocity works on detection and determination the level of biogenic amines in different foods and wines. Although, different methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) are usually used for sep-aration and detection of biogenic amines in foods, ferment-ed foods and wines, the aim of this study is to develop and optimise the HPTLC method for qualitative and quantita-tive analysis of five biogenic amines in few red and white wines as an alternative method with several advantages. Materials and methodsSamples and chemicals: A total 12 wine samples (six red wines and six white wines) were collected from differ-ent winery and different aging period for determination of five biogenic amines. All chemicals and reagents were ana-S5 OP 220464Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 463 - 464 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationslytical grade. The hydrochloride forms of biogenic amines were used as standards and purchased from Sigma, Merck and VWR from Germany. Stock solution of His, Cad, Put, Phe and Tyr dissolved in 10% EtOH was prepared (500 ppm) and then for determination of calibration curve were prepared standard biogenic amines solutions: 0.1 mg\/L; 0.5 mg\/L; 1 mg\/L; 5 mg\/L; 10 mg\/L; 15 mg\/L in which 1.6 diaminohexan was added as internal standard. Preparation of wine samples for HPTLC analysis: liq-uid-liquid extraction of biogenic amines from wines was made by following procedure: 5 mL of wine sample was mixed with 1 mL 5 M NaOH and 2 mL 5 M Na2CO3. Af-ter that were added successively three times butanol (6 Ml + 3 mL + 3 ml), and upper butanol layer was segregate and mixed 4 min. with 5 mL 0.1 M HCl. Separated lower layer was derivatised as followed: 200 mL sample was mixed in plastic tubes (2 mL) with 400 mL Dansyl chloride (50 mg\/ 10 mL acetone) and 200 mL NaHCO3 (1.5 g\/ 10 mL H2O). Derivatisation was conducted at 60 degC on dark place for 60 min. and after that in sample was added 500 mL toluene. The above layer was separated and put in vials for automat-ic ATS4 application of the sample on the HPTLC plate. For elution of biogenic amines was used 10 mL mobile phase: Toluene:Chloroform:Trietylamine (10:6:5 by volume) and 0.5% Tween 80. Saturation time was 40 min. at room tem-perature, on dark, avoiding air movements. Overall elution time was 20 min. Instrumentation and conditions: HPTLC plates pre-coated with silica gel 60F254 (20 cm x 10 cm) from Merck (Germany) were used as the stationary phase. The samples were sprayed on the HPTLC plate (spray-on technique) with the help of a sample applicator AUTOMATIC TLC SAMPLER 4 (ATS4, CAMAG). The chromatogram was developed in horizontal developing chamber (CAMAG). Detection of components from developed HPTLC plates was made with fluorescence Vilber Lourmat detector. Ob-tained chromatograms were analyzed by software packag-es Infinity 15.01 and Tina.Results and discussionBiogenic amines are of increasing interest to the wine industry due to proposed regulatory issues. Although HPTLC technique is relatively simple, it is difficult to make directly separations of biogenic amines from com-plex wine matrix. For effectively separation of biogenic amines and solve the problem with effect of wine matrix into qualitative and quantitative routine analysis two deri-vatisation agents FMOC-CL (9-fluoroenylmethyl chloro-formate) and DAN-CL (dansyl chloride) were investigat-ed. After derivatisations and liquid-liquid extraction, bio-genic amines in wine samples were simultaneously anal-ysed by using CAMAG ATS 4 automatic sampler on pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 plate and Vilber Louromat fluo-rescent detector. After analysis of obtained results was con-cludes that second development derivatisation and modifi-cated liquid-liquid extraction protocol allowed effectively HPTLC separations and identification of biogenic amines in complex wine (red and white) matrix in concentration from 0.1 to 15 mg\/mL. Results of analysis shown that all red wine samples had higher level of biogenic amines than white wines. The validated method displayed excellent se-lectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and ro-bustness.ConclusionAccording to the known literature data, analysis of bio-genic amines by HPTLC method in wines has been used for the first time in Republic of Macedonia. The optimised HPTLC method compared with HPLC is less expensive for routine analyses of wines and enables reducing the use of organic solvents for derivatisation and for mobile phase, and provides an opportunity for determination of biogen-ic amines without higher interference with the compounds from the complex red or white wine matrix. In conclusion, the proposed HPTLC method is suitable for application in analysis of biogenic amines in differ-ent wines and could be considered as an alternative meth-od and an important tool in routine analysis of biogenic amines in wine.

also follows EU legis-lation. Laws on Medicines in Macedonia and Serbia are harmonized with the EU regulation of medicines.Macedonia follows EU legislation for food supple-ments. The products are regulated by the special require-ments for safety of food supplements from 2012 (Official Gazzette of Republic of Serbia no. 45\/10, 27\/11; 50\/12), and the Rulebook amending the Rulebook on special re-quirements for food supplements from 2013 and 2015 (Of-ficial Gazzette of Republic of Serbia, no. 41\/13), and in compliance with the Croatian Rulebook on food supple-ments in terms of their classification from 2013. Serbia also follows EU legislation, but has not implemented and do not follow the Regulation on nutrition and health claims, novel food regulation procedures and the law on using symbols on packaging and packaging waste. For food supplements, indications and properties that are not possessed should not be attributed (Dzeparoski, 2013; Kotler, 1989; Kotler and Keler, 2009). The main goal of this paper was to make comparative analysis of advertising and promotion of the product Sen-tis by the company Bionika Pharmaceuticals in Macedonia and Serbia. The marketing campaigns, TV spots and inter-net advertisement have been analyzed. The choice of the countries is based upon different product categorization in which Sentis is classified.Materials and methodsComparative method for analyzing the regulation, ad-vertising and promotion of the food supplements and tradi-tional herbal medicines was used.Results and discussionCase studySentis is a natural sedative in the form of soft gela-tin capsules containing 200 mg of extract of valerian root (Valeriana Officinalis). In Macedonia Sentis is registered in 2012 as traditional herbal medicine (THM), while in Serbia is registered as a food supplement in 2013. Valeri-an root has been used since ancient times before the exis-tence of synthetic sedatives. The action is due to valeren-ic acid; experimental pharmacological studies have shown that it reduces motility, causing hypnotic activity, offset-ting the effect of caffeine and improves coordination. In both countries registered indications are temporary relieve of the symptoms of nervous tension, stress and insomnia. Benefits are unlike synthetic sedatives, it does not cause drowsiness and dependence (Bionika, 2013; PDR, 2007; WHO, 1999).The differences regarding dosing and indications, re-sulting from the different classification of the same prod-uct are as follows:- dosing registered as THM in Macedonia is 4 x 200 mg, while as food supplement in Serbia maximum daily dose is decreased to 2 x 200 mg;- -indications are the same in both countries, ex-cept that in Macedonia additionally is registered the sedative effect. S2 PP 75168Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 167 - 168 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsThese differences concern advertising and promotion-al activities. In Macedonia and Serbia same package in green and stylized cubist design of flowers and brain with minimal-istic look is used. The text on the package and the patient leaflets are different in accordance with the categoriza-tion, in correlation with the specific regulation. For THM it is written clearly that it is medicine without prescription, with specific 6 line content structure of the patient leaflet and indications based on traditional use. For the food sup-plement is clearly stated that the product is food supple-ment and also ingredients, nutrition and energetic values must be printed on the package, whereas the leaflet and claims are not obligatory. In Serbia the food supplement Sentis is sold with leaflet which contains claims.Internet is universal and powerful digital marketing tool in promotion of company products, including compa-ny web-sites. The content of websites also varies in differ-ent countries.Promotional materials are with similar text content and same design in both countries, except the statement that it is THM or food supplement. The other difference for the THM is also that \"the patient leaflet should be read, for more information you should consult your pharmacist or doctor\". The last is valid for all forms of advertisement. TV spot for Sentis as THM has been approved for ad-vertising in electronic media to the general public by the Ministry of Health. The message which should remain in the subconscious of the audience is that when you use Sen-tis the life will be without anxiety, stress, carefree, without worries and the consumer will continue on with life. TV spot for Sentis as food supplement in Serbia is from infor-mative character. It is not necessary approval for advertis-ing, because is based on generally accepted scientific data and they are comprehensible to the average consumer. In Serbia should be submitted for approval only health claims for reducing the risk of disease. The message which should remain in the subconscious of the audience is that it is a natural product for healthy people, which if used will help reduce certain symptoms. Except promoting the product, with both advertise-ments is also promoted the new pharmaceutical company. TV advertising in Macedonia with a strong and distinctive message, along with the promotion activities, helped the company to achieve significant market share in this seg-ment. Marketing of products by companies should be in accordance with the current country regulation for specif-ic product category.ConclusionThere are major differences in the marketing of THM\/OTC and food supplements. All promotional materials for THM to the general public are subject to approval by reg-ulatory bodies, based on the approved summary of product characteristics and patient leaflet. The marketing of food supplements is more liberal in advertising and in Serbia is not subject to approval, if based on generally accepted sci-entific data. Macedonia follows the EU Regulation on nu-trition and health claims for food supplements. The results of the case study can also be used for preparation of mar-keting materials for other products on other markets of in-terest with similar regulation.

Trajkovska, Maja Ilijoska, Andrea Alagjozovska, Hristina Tomovska, Nada Stojanoska, Hristina Babunovska ALKALOID AD-Skopje, Pharmaceutical, Chemical and Cosmetics Company, Aleksandar Makedonski 12, Skopje, Macedonia* bbujarovska@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionNear InfraRed - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) in recent years has gained much interest due to its simple maintenance and short measuring time. This technique differs from the conventional techniques such as HPLC and GC, because the essential component is the sampling interface. That allows for fast, non-destructive measurement of materials with little or no sample preparation. Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is used for identification on every container that has been delivered. The principle is based on the comparison of the spectral data of the substance with the spectral data of several samples, which are present in a spectral reference library. These samples have positive chemical\/physical and microbiological test analysis, tested in accordance with producer Certificate of Analysis and producer Drug Master File. Positive identification of these samples originally is confirmed with IR Spectrophotometry or other specific identification method. Besides others parameters, these analyses include testing of loss on drying, content of water, optical rotation, related substances and assay that may cause of variables in the NIR spectra. According to the \"Guideline on the use of NIR spectroscopy by the pharmaceutical industry and the data requirements for new submission and variations\" issued by the European Medicine Agency, when NIR procedures are used for qualitative analysis should be validated for a minimum specificity and robustness (EMA, 2009). For the specificity, independent set of samples is created of different batches, which are not included in the creating of the reference library. All of the samples should be approved correctly (pass). The reference library should be also challenged with relevant structural analogues, which should be rejected (fail). As for robustness, the effects of relevant variables should be understood, tested and documented. Some of the variables include: environmental temperature, humidity, different probe depth, different packaging material, changes in the instrumental method, for example the number of scans. Also instrumental variation can be consider, e.g. changing lamps or reflectance material.Materials and methodsThe NIRS analyses were performed on Thermo Antaris II FT-NIR Analyzer. It is dedicated FT-NIR analyzer designed specifically for use in the industrial environments of the pharmaceutical, food and beverages, chemical and polymer industries (Hirsch, 2008). Some of the characteristics of the instrument are: the detection is performed on high - sensitive, high - stable matched InGaAs; the light source is long - life, high intensity halogen NIR source; the interferometer is frictionless stable, long - life Michelson. The sampling method used is Fiber Optic. NIRS sampling by fiber optics allows rapid point-of-use QC for raw material identification. The Antaris II Fiber Optic module can be used with the SabIR hand - held diffuse reflectance probe which can analyze samples directly or indirectly through packaging materials. The spectral range of SabIR Probe is 12000 - 4000 cm-1. The probe shaft is made of stainless steel, and the window material of the shaft is made is made of high quality, chemical resistance sapphire according to the instrument specification (Antaris II FT-NIR Analyzer).The method that is used in Alkaloid is with SabIR Fiber Optic module. The spectral range in which the collecting is performed is 10000 - 4000 cm-1. The number of scans in 30, and the resolution is 8 cm-1.In the first step of creating the reference library, NIR S2 PP 76170Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 169 - 170 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsspectrum of Ibuprofen Lysine Reference standard was collected. Due to lack of certified reference standard from pharmacopoeia, in - house standard sent from the suitable manufacturer was used. Further the library was continually updated with samples of commercial batches of Ibuprofen lysine received from the manufacturer.The spectral reference library is composed of spectra collected with direct scanning of the substance and indirect scanning (through the polyethylene bag). In routine, indirect scanning is preferred, by reason of faster scanning and not requiring opening every package. The NIR method for identification of Ibuprofen lysine was validated in terms of Specificity and Robustness, according to the Guideline on the use of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) by the pharmaceutical industry and the data requirement for the new submissions and variations, issued by the European Medicine Agency.Results and discussionVerification workflows are created for performance the following tests of specificity and robustness. These workflows are chosen for verification of the production workflow for Ibuprofen lysine.Verification workflow for performing specificityOne verification workflow that contains independent set of three samples, which are batches not included in the reference library are included is created. The results for these samples are PASS. The other verification workflow has three different substances that have similar structure with Ibuprofen Lysine, and therefore is expected to have similar NIR spectrum. That is Ibuprofen, the difference is with the Lysine group; Ketoprofen, belongs to the same group of Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; Paracetamol, together with Ketoprofen, they have similar structure. The result for Ibuprofen Lysine is PASS, and for the other three substances is FAIL.Verification workflow for robustnessRobustness is performed for testing the effect of minor changes to normal operating conditions on the analysis (Tang, 2012). Verification workflows are created for performance these tests. The parameters for validation robustness of the method, which can affect the method in our operating environment, are the following: change in the number of scans (performed only with indirectly scanning), change in probe depth (performed with direct scanning) and change in thickness of the packaging material (performed with indirect scanning). The results for these three workflow are PASS, which brings the conclusion that certain changes in the method does not affect the test results. ConclusionThe obtained results confirm that the NIR method for identification of Ibuprofen lysine is verified and appropriate for it use. ReferencesEuropean Medicines Agency, 2009.

The solvents are not completely removed by the manufacturing techniques and therefore it is required appropriate selection of the solvent for the synthesis. The solvent used can enhance the yield, or even determine some of the characteristic of the substances, such as crystal form, purity and solubility (CHMP, 2015). Considering that residual solvents do not provide any therapeutically benefits, they should be removed, to the extent possible, to meet ingredient and product specifications and good manufacturing practices. The residual solvents, based on their toxicity, are divided into three groups. The solvents that are known to cause unacceptable toxicities are class 1. In this group belongs: benzene, carbon tetrachloride; 1,2-dichlorethane; 1,1 - dichlorethene and 1,1,1-trichlorethane. These solvents are proven human carcinogens and environmental hazardous. Considering the unacceptable toxicity, this class of solvents should be avoided during the manufacturing process, unless their use can be strongly justified in a risk-benefit assessment. The Class 2 solvents are associated with less severe toxicity. Some of the solvents that belong to this group are: acetonitrile; chloroform; 1,2-dichlorethene; N,N-dimethylacetamide; N,N-dimethylformamide; 1,4-dioxane; ethylene glycol; formamide; methanol; hexane; pyridine; toluene. The use of these solvents should be limited in order to protect the patients from potential adverse effects. Ideally, less toxic solvents should be used where is possible. Those are solvents that belong to Class 3. They are counted as less toxic and of lower risk to human health then Class 1 and Class 2 residual solvents. The solvents in this class are not known as a human health hazard at level normally accepted in pharmaceuticals. However there are no long-term toxicity or carcinogenicity studies for many of the residual solvents in Class 3. Available data so far, indicate that they are less toxic in acute or short term studies and negative in genotoxicity studies. Some of the solvents that belong to this group are: acetic acid; acetone; 1-butanol; 2-butanol; dimethyl sulfoxide; ethanol; ethyl acetate; ethyl ether; formic acid (USP, 2015).Residual solvent that was used in the synthesis of sodium citrate is methanol. Since methanol belongs to class 2 residual solvents, quantification should be performed. Materials and methodsThe experiments were performed on Shimadzu 2010 Plus GC instrument. The pressure was set to 9.8 Psi, column flow was 2.08 mL\/min and total flow was 15.5 mL\/min. Helium was used as the carrier gas. Other gases that were used are Hydrogen and Air. The injection volume was 1000 uL and the split was 1:5. The column used is DB-624, 30 m x 0.32 mm, 1.8 um (Agilent). Methanol standard was supplied from Merck Darmstad (Shimazdu, 2013).The methanol standard solution was prepared in final concertation of 150 ppm."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","inner_id":6,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":7,"annotations":[{"id":7,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":11626,"end":11644,"text":"multiple

Proper function-ing and performance of software and computer systems play a major role in obtaining consistency, reliability and accuracy of data. Therefore, computer system validation (CSV) should be part of any good development and manufacturing practice. It is also requested by EU and FDA regulations and guidelines through the overall requirement that \"equipment must be suit-able for its intended use\".Specific requirements for computers can be found in sec-tion 211.68 of the US cGMP regulations (USC, 2008). * Automatic, mechanical, or electronic equipment or other types of equipment, including computers, or related systems that will perform a function satis-factorily, may be used in the manufacture, process-ing, packing, and holding of a drug product. If such equipment is so used, it shall be routinely calibrat-ed, inspected, or checked according to a written pro-gram designed to assure proper performance. Writ-ten records of those calibration checks and inspec-tions shall be maintained. * Appropriate controls shall be exercised over comput-er or related systems to assure that changes in master production and control records or other records are instituted only by authorized personnel. * Input to and output from the computer or related system of formulas or other records or data shall be checked for accuracy. * The degree and frequency of input\/output verifica-tion shall be based on the complexity and reliability of the computer or related system. * A backup file of data entered into the computer or re-lated system shall be maintained except where cer-tain data, such as calculations performed in connec-tion with laboratory analysis, are eliminated by com-puterization or other automated processes. In such instances a written record of the program shall be maintained along with appropriate validation data. * Hard copy or alternative systems, such as duplicates, tapes, or microfilm, shall be designed to assure that backup data are exact and complete and that it is se-cure from alteration, inadvertent erasures, or loss shall be maintained.Specific requirements for computers and electronic re-cords and signatures are also defined in FDA's regulations 21 CFR Part 11 on electronic Records and Signatures (USC, 1997).The Good Automated Manufacturing Practices Forum (GAMP) has developed guidelines for computer validation. All these guidelines and publications follow a couple of prin-ciples:* Validation of computer systems is not a onetime event. It starts with the definition of the product or project and setting user requirement specifications and cover the vendor selection process, installation, initial operation, going use, and change control and system retirement. * All publications refer to some kind of life cycle mod-el with a formal change control procedure being an important part of the whole process. * There are no detailed instructions on what should be tested. All guidelines refer to risk assessment for the extent of validation.Validation of computer systems is not a once off event. Annex 11 of the European GMP directive is very clear about this: Validation should be considered as part of the complete life cycle of a computer system. This cycle includes the stag-es of planning, specification, programming, testing, commis-sioning, documentation, operation, monitoring and modify-ing\" (EC, 2010).Scope The scope of this work is to present the validation of ERP SAP computer system used in Alkaloid AD Skopje known as AlkaSAP system.S2 PP 110238Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 237 - 238 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsBackgroundAlkaSAP system was implemented in Alkaloid AD Sko-pje in 2007. Within AlkaSAP there are several 'modules', each of which contains transactions in order to perform nec-essary tasks to complete business processes. Several of these tasks and processes are considered critical or have regulatory implications to Alkaloid. The SAP implemented modules in Alkaloid AD Skopje in 2007 were: 1. Sales & Distribution (SD)2. Production Planning (PP)3. Quality Management (QM)4. Materials Management (MM)5. Financial Accounting (FI)6. Controlling (CO)During 2014 additional SAP module concerning human capital management (HCM) was implemented. Validation of the AlkaSAPValidation of the AlkaSAP system was made in accor-dance with GAMP 4. All validation activities were defined in Validation Master Plan (VMP). The validation programme was divided into phases according to the validation life cy-cle. Each phase was divided into tasks and for every task there were actions, responsibilities and associated procedures. Specification \/ Design PhaseDuring this phase the following documents were created:Validation Master Plan (VMP); User Requirement Spec-ification (URS); Functional Specification (FS); Risk Assess-ment (RsA); Hardware Design Specification (HDS); Software Design Specification (SDS); Code Review (CR);Testing phaseBoth hardware and software elements were tested as part of the AlkaSAP implementation.Hardware Acceptance TestingHardware Acceptance Testing (including Infrastructure) was conducted successfully on all servers.Document reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP HATSSoftware Acceptance TestingAll bespoke and functional application software identi-fied in the Functional Specification or Software Design Speci-fication was tested against the Software Acceptance test Spec-ification.Document Reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP SATSSoftware Performance Test SpecificationAll software identified in the Functional Specification or Software Design Specification was given a risk priority and was tested against the Software Performance Test Specifica-tion:Document Reference: CSV VMP AlkaSAP SPTSIn accordance with risk priority given in the Risk Assess-ment tests were executed as Detailed Functional Tests; User Acceptance Tests; Business ScenariosValidation ReportThe Validation Report has been issued as a phased report for the purpose of 'go-live' for the AlkaSAP and summarizes the validation programme activities.Document Reference: CSV VMR AlkaSAPOngoing Operation and EvaluationIn order to control and maintain the validation status of the AlkaSAP system, the following procedures are established and written:Policies and Procedures for Security and Access to serv-ersPolicies and Procedures for Back Up, Restore and Ar-chiveProcedures for Training and Operating of the systemPeriodic reviewPeriodic Reviews of the System is covered by Alkaloid Guideline ensuring SOPs, validation documentation and re-cords are audited on a regular basis to evaluate the effective-ness of controlling procedures.SummaryAlkaloid AD Skopje started 'go-live' with the validated AlkaSAP computer system. The validation test results were of sufficient detail and quality to establish that this computer sys-tem does what it purports to do. AlkaSAP still remains status of \"validated system\" which can be proved with regular periodic review of the system.ReferencesAlkaSAP Validation Master Plan version 2.0, 21st November 2006.European Commission (EC), 2010.

There are 400 - 500 compounds that have been identified in its extracts, and among them approximately 70 are C21 terpenophenols, members of a group known as cannabinoids, specific for this plant (ElSohly and Slade, 2005; Fischedick, et al., 2009; Turn-er, et al., 1980). The constituent of Cannabis sativa L., D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9THC), is the primary psychoac-tive cannabinoid. Given that the main pharmacological and psychoactive effects have been attributed to this com-pound, the most of the studies have been focused on its ef-fects (Costa, 2007). The effects of Cannabis sativa L. are not solely due to 9THC because cannabidiol (CBD) was found to cause pharmacological effects (Russo and Guy, 2006). It was shown that CBD and other cannabinoids achieve synergy with 9THC causing potentiation of ben-efits, antagonism of adverse effects, summation, pharma-cokinetic advantages, and metabolism (Russo and Guy, 2006). Many countries became more liberal towards medici-nal use of Cannabis sativa L. (Baker et al., 2003). Recent-ly there has been an increasing interest in development of cannabinoids and Cannabis sativa L. preparations as legiti-mate medicines for a variety of medical applications. Some of them include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, glaucoma, asthma and cardiovascular condi-tions, and as an antiemetic (Williamson and Evans, 2000). Cannabidoids are very potent compounds and their control in Cannabis sativa L. preparations is very important, espe-cially because their potential users are patients which al-ready have serious health problems. The aim of this study was to apply our in-house HPLC\/DAD method on the Cannabis sativa L. preparations pres-ent in the European market and to control their quality.Materials and methodsThe samples of Cannabis sativa L. preparations were purchased from the European market, produced by Endoca (Pharmaceutical Company, Denmark). The standard sub-stances were obtained from Lipomed AG (Switzerland). The samples of standard substances were: 9-THC (3-pen-tyl-6,6,9-trimethyl-6a,7,8,10a-tetrahydro-6H-dibenzo(b,d)pyran-1-ol), delivered as 1 mL ampule solution (5 mg\/ mL prepared in ethanol, with purity 98.52%, m\/m) and CBD ((-)-trans-2-p-mentha-1,8-dien-3-yl-5-pentylresorcinol) as the solid substance (99.73%, m\/m). The solvents used dur-ing the analysis were with HPLC grade. For the chromatographic analysis Agilent Technolo-gies HPLC system 1200 series (Germany) was used. The analysis was performed on HPLC-column: Purospher(r) Star RP18e (150 mm x 4.6 mm ID, 5 um) from Merck KGaA (Germany) using mobile phase composed of ace-tonitrile and water in gradient mode with acetonitrile from 50%, V\/V, to 80%, V\/V, at flow rate 1.5 mL\/min, tempera-ture 30 degC, detection at 220 nm, injection 10 uL, in 31 min run time. The working solutions of standard substance CBD were prepared in methanol in two concentration ranges: S2 PP 111240Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 239 - 240 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentations95.48 ug\/mL - 286.43 ug\/mL and 103.13 ug\/mL - 309.40 ug\/mL. The 9THC working solutions were prepared in methanol in concentration range: 9.81 ug\/mL - 19.63 ug\/mL. The sample solutions were prepared by liquid\/liquid extraction technique using a mixture of methanol and chlo-roform (9:1). When the layers were clearly separated, the sample from the methanolic layer was applied in HPLC\/DAD system. Results and discussionFive different Cannabis sativa L. preparations pur-chased from the European market were analyzed. All were prepared from hemp oil with various amounts of CBD as active compound and naturally contains 9-THC, as an im-purity. According to the certificates the amount of CBD was: 3%; 5%; 10 %; 15% and 30%, m\/m, and expected im-purity as 9THC was limited at maximum of 0.20%, m\/m.For preparation of the samples we used the recom-mended United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime meth-od (UNODC Manual, 2009). For identification and quan-tification of cannabinoids we used our in-house chromato-graphic gradient method which we have proposed for hemp seed oil analysis (Shishovska et al., 2014) because of the similarity of samples in origin and form. In the analyzed samples of hemp oil preparations can-nabidiol and 9THC were identified and quantified. Iden-tifications were done by comparing of the retention times and UV spectra of standard compounds with retention times of peaks at the chromatograms of samples and their UV spectra. The retention times of CBD and 9THC peaks were 15.9 min and 21.0 min, respectively.For the quantification, data obtained from the chro-matograms were calculated using the method of the cal-ibration curve (constructed as concentration, c (ug\/ml), versus peak area, A (mAU)). The analyzed working solu-tions of the active compound CBD and the trace compound 9THC showed high linearity in the working ranges. The estimated coefficient of the linearity for CBD working so-lutions at concentration range: 95.48 ug\/mL - 286.43 ug\/mL was 1.000 (A = 23688 c + 16.188); while for the CBD working solutions at concentration range: 103.13 ug\/mL - 309.40 ug\/mL it was 0.9998 (A = 39613 c + 31.129), and for the working solutions of standard substance 9THC at concentration range: 9.81 ug\/mL - 19.63 ug\/mL it was 0.9997 (A = 25269 c - 7.0738).It was found that content of cannabidiol in analyzed samples is from 109.7% to 125.4%, m\/m of the declared values. The assays of 9THC traces at the samples vary according the concentration of the active compound. As quantities of CBD at samples were lower (3 - 5%), the as-say of 9THC is under the allowed maximum limit (0.02% - 0.14%), but at samples with higher concentrations of CBD (10 - 30%) the 9THC traces are above the allowed maximum limit (0.45% - 1.14%).ConclusionThe satisfactory chromatographic data proved that our in-house gradient HPLC\/DAD method can be successful-ly used for determination of the active substance CBD and traces of 9THC in Cannabis sativa L. preparations. The results obtained for the analyzed samples of Cannabis sati-va L. preparations showed higher amounts of CBD than de-clared value in the certificate (differences range from 9.7% m\/m to 25.4%, m\/m). In two samples, the amount of 9THC found was under allowed maximum limit of 0.20%, while in three samples the amount was above that value."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":8,"annotations":[{"id":8,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":711,"end":729,"text":"Cannabis sativa L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"XG9nwjj6In","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":1252,"end":1270,"text":"Cannabis sativa L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"7UX8Fuh4IW","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.215618Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.215618Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7375.286000000002,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"d5cbefff-02b3-4414-bf26-73785f586381","import_id":8,"last_action":null,"task":8,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"099b3cd5-ifra_reviewed_all.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Not all of the samples tested have composition as declared in the certificate, although they all origin from a European manu-facturer and are present in the European market.ReferencesBaker, D., Pryce, G., Giovannoni, G., Thompson, A.J., 2003.

G. Bonchev Str., build. 9, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria* deni@orgchm.bas.bgIntroductionNitrofurantoin (N-(5-nitro-2-furfurylidene)-1-amino-hydantoin) is antimicrobial compound, used extensively as a prophylactic for urinary tract infections in humans and animals (Maaland and Guardabassi, 2011). It is reported that the modes of action underlying DNA damage or cyto-toxicity induced by nitrofurantoin in rodent liver and lungs may involve ROS generation by reduction to nitro radi-cal anion (Suntres and Shek, 1992). A recent study showed that the drug exhibits carcinogenicity in the kidneys of male rats and the structure of the nitro furan plays a key role in the induced genotoxicity (Kijima et al., 2015).Most nitroaromatic drugs, containing nitroquinone, ni-troimidazole or nitrofuran moiety, are considered to ex-ert their toxic effect by nitro reduction (Boelsterli et al., 2006). One-electron reduction of the nitro group catalyzed by nitro-reductase gives rise to nitro anion radical, the chemical instability of which promotes production of var-ious ROS such as superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical via its electron-donating ability (Wang et al., 2008).Despite these drawbacks, new nitrofuran derivatives are still being developed as antimicrobial agents (Zorzi et al., 2014). Therefore, improved knowledge on the struc-ture and reactivity of nitrofurantoin radical anion could help reduce the toxicity of the new nitrofuran antimicro-bial agents.This reports motivated us to generate electrochemi-cally the nitro radical anion of nitrofurantoin and study its chemical structure by spectroscopic IR methods and DFT computations. The radical anion was electrochemically generated and the spectral and structural changes arising from the conversion were described based on IR spectra and DFT calculations. The structural variations, electron charge distribution over molecular fragments and IR fre-quency shifting were discussed. Materials and methodsThe electrochemical generation of the radical anion of nitrofurantoin was carried out in a special CaF2 cell, provided with platinum electrodes build in the polyethyl-ene spacer. 4.5 V were applied to the cathode in the solu-tion cell containing 0.1 mol\/l nitrofurantoin and equimo-lar amount of tetraethylammonium bromide in DMSO-d6. Electrochemical generation of the radical anion was con-tinued for a period of 75 min and then the polarity of the electrolysis cell was reversed in order to regenerate the parent compound. The process of nitrofurantoin reduc-tion and regeneration was monitored by recording IR spec-tra in 10 min intervals. The IR spectra were measured on a Brucker Tensor 27 FT spectrometer at a resolution of 2 cm-1 and 64 scans. All theoretical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package of programs. Geometry and vibra-tional frequencies of species studied were performed by analytical gradient technique without any symmetry con-straint. All the results were obtained using the density func-tional theory (DFT), employing the B3LYP (Becke's three-parameter non-local exchange correlation) method in con-junction with 6-311+G(2df,p) basis set. In order to account for the ifluence of the medium, we used the Integral Equa-tion Formalism Polarizable Continuum Model (IEF-PCM) on the same level of theory with inclusion of DMSO.Results and discussionThe initial IR spectrum of nitrofurantion in DMSO-d6 solution, containing tetraethylammonium bromide as S2 PP 112242Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 241 - 242 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationselectrolyte salt, showed that the asymmetric and symmet-ric stretching vibrations of the nitro group are observed at 1521 and 1350 cm-1. The stretching vibration of the N-C bond linking the nitro group to the furan ring is found at rather high wavenumber - 1211 cm-1, respectively. A few minutes after applying the current, the solution in cathode space became brown, and the bands of the anion radical of nitrofurantoin appeared in the IR spectrum. More pro-longed electrolysis (75 min) caused strong increase of the bands of the anion radical, while the bands of the neutral compound vanished. Reversal in the polarity of the elec-trolysis cell resulted in gradual decrease of the IR bands of the radical anion and reappearance of the neutral mole-cule absorptions. After 75 min of reversed electrolysis the initial spectrum of the parent compound was completely restored without the presence of any additional IR bands. This fact unambiguously demonstrates that the observed spectral changes are due to the reduction of nitrofurantoin to radical anion and not to other chemical transformations.The conversion of nitrofurantoin into radical anion is related to strong frequency decreases in the assymetric N-O stretching: Dnas(NO2) = 220 cm-1, strong frequency decreases in the symetric N-O stretching: Dns(NO2) = 209 cm-1 and strong frequency increase in C-NO2 stretching: Dn(C-NO2) = 273 cm-1. Based on the calculated spin den-sity, the odd electron is localized mainly on the nitro group (c.a. 70%) and in smaller extends - on the furan ring (c.a. 30%). The radical anion formation leads to simultaneous shortening of the C-N bond and lengthening of the N-O bonds.ConclusionThe observed frequency shifts arising from the con-version of nitrofurantoin into radical anion are larger than those found with the conversion of dinitrobenzenes and cy-anobenzonitriles. It is evidence that larger structural vari-ations in the nitrofuran moiety occur upon conversion into radical anion than in case of dinitrobenzenes and nitroben-zonitriles. The localization of the spin density over the ni-tro group is a sign for high reactivity of the formed nitro-furantoin radical anion and strong ability to initiate pro-duction of various ROS via electron donation. The impor-tance of aminohydantoin moiety for the stability and reac-tivity of the nitrofurantoin radical anion has to be elucidat-ed by studying other nitrofuran derivatives with modified side chains.Acknowledgements The financial support of this work by the National Sci-ence Fund of Bulgaria (Contracts RNF01\/0110), Science Fund is gratefully acknowledged.ReferencesBoelsterli, U.A., Ho, H.K., Zhou, S., Leow, K.Y., 2006.

Generally, its treatment is based on immunosuppressive drugs. Azathioprine is thiopurine metabolite with immuno-suppressive and cytotoxic effects, which is used in the treat-ment of inflammatory bowel disease and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Unfortunately, about one third of patients under azathioprine therapy, have need for modify-ing or terminating the treatment because of adverse effects or low therapeutic outcome. As a prodrug of 6- mercapto-purine (6-MP), azathioprine acts through the formation of thioguanine and methylthioinosine nucleotides, which are capable of incorporating in DNA strains like \"false\" bases (Dervieux and Boulieu, 1998). Hence the immunosuppres-sive effect, target cells of azathioprine main metabolites - 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercapto-purine (6-MMP) are the \"fast-growing\" cells, mainly lym-phocytes, though the bone marrow and the hepatic cells are not excluded. Consequently, the risk-benefit ratio of azathi-oprine therapy is dose-dependent and here lies the crucial need for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) (Vikingsson, 2012). On the other hand, intra- and inter-individual varia-tions seem to reflect individual differences in 6-MP absorp-tion and metabolism, resulting in different bioavailability and distribution of the active metabolites in patients receiv-ing similar doses. The purpose of this study is to establish a specific, sensitive HPLC method for simultaneous deter-mination of 6-TGN and 6-MMP found in erythrocytes af-ter azathioprine administration. Materials and methodsChemicals and reagents. 6-MMP, 6-TGN and dithio-threitol (DTT- derivatization agent) were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, USA. Methanol, phosphate buffer (pH 3,5), perchloric acid, hydrochloric acid, all HPLC grade, were obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Ger-many. For all analysis, HPLC grade water was used. Zorb-ax Eclipse XDB C18 column, 150 x 4.5mm, 5 mm was sup-plied by Agilent Technologies. Erythrocyte samples. Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers (used for method validation) and from patients under azathioprine therapy (used like testing samples). Erythrocytes were extracted by centrifugation at 4 degS. Further on, the eppendorf tubes were normalized on 4kh109 erythrocytes, and frozen at -80 degS until the analysis.Preparation of standard solutions. Stock solution of the analytes (5 mg\/ml 6-TGN and 40 mg\/ml 6-MMR) were pre-pared by dissolving each compound in 0,1 M HCl. Work-ing solutions were prepared in 6 different concentrations (concentration range between 0,04 mg\/ml to 2,50 mg\/ml for 6-TGN and 0,25 mg\/ml to 20 mg\/ml for 6-MMR) from stock solutions by dilution with 0,1 M HCl. Calibration stan-dards were made by spiking the blank erythrocytes with appropriate volume of working solutions of 6-TGN and 6-MMP at six different concentration. Samples for qual-ity control (QC) were prepared in 4 different concentra-tions that cover the range of the calibration curve (LLOQ, low QC, medium QC, high QC appropriate for 6-TGN and 6-MMP). Sample preparation. Sample solutions were made by adding DTT in each eppendorf tube which contains 500 ml of erythrocytes from patients under azathioprine therapy. In each eppendorf tube 50 ml 70% Perchloric acid (acid hy-drolysis and deproteinization agent) was added and centri-fuged at 3000 rpm, for 15 minutes at 4 degC.

Acid superna-tants were collected and heated at 100 degC for 45 minutes in order to release thiopurine bases after hydrolysis. Chromatographic conditions. The separation was car-ried out with Agilent 1100 HPLC system on Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18, 150 x 4.5mm, 5mm column using gradient elu-tion with methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 3,5) in ratio 5:95 (V\/V) with linear gradient to 15:85 (V\/V) for a period of 12 minutes and flow rate of 1,2 ml\/min. The temperature was set at 25 degC with UV detection at 341 nm for 6-TGN and 304 nm for 6-MMP. Method was validated following the recommendations for validation of bioanalytical meth-ods of EMA guideline (Guideline on validation of bioana-lytical methods, European Medicines Agency, 2011). Results and discussionThe recovery values of the extraction procedure were higher than 84% for both metabolites, 6-TGN and 6-MMP. Under the proposed chromatographic conditions, no inter-fering peaks were observed in the retention time of analyt-es. The correlation coefficient from calibration curves for linearity of the method was 0.9996 for 6-TGN and 0.9989 for 6-MMP, respectively. The results for accuracy (+-15% of the nominal values for the QC samples and +- 20% of the nominal value for the LLOQ) and precision (the val-ue for coefficient of variation should not exceed 15% for QC samples and 20% for LLOQ) were within recommend-ed limits. Stability studies indicated that no stability relat-ed problems would be expected during the routine erythro-cytes sample analysis."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","inner_id":8,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":9,"annotations":[{"id":9,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":2201,"end":2217,"text":"anti-inflamatory","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"8nv0GsoJba","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":5049,"end":5065,"text":"anti-inflamatory","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"Yo3CUAOwzC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":5245,"end":5262,"text":"anti-inflammatory","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"Wa-dxRFaio","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":5547,"end":5564,"text":"anti-inflammatory","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"rT6uKhKHEC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7273,"end":7290,"text":"anti-inflammatory","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"L4f1LNq2gM","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7515,"end":7526,"text":"antioxidant","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"bj-8cxGZ7F","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7540,"end":7549,"text":"cytotoxic","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"coe5Gcbu-9","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7591,"end":7612,"text":"Plantago altissima L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"P9AxXPEVfg","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7617,"end":7639,"text":"Plantago lanceolata L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"NscGxD5dKX","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7799,"end":7810,"text":"antioxidant","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"bQ9T_iElDi","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7812,"end":7829,"text":"anti-inflammatory","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"dK-eqhOn3t","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7834,"end":7843,"text":"cytotoxic","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"sqvwdEHKHn","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7866,"end":7894,"text":"Plantago reniformis G.

These compounds include the eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, prostacyclin, leu-kotrienes, and thromboxane and the modified phospholip-ids such as platelet activating factor (PAF). Eicosanoids are synthesized from 20-carbon polyunsaturated fatty arachi-donic acid, found in many cells, including activated leu-kocytes, mast cells, and platelets and therefore are widely distributed. Many inflammatory mediators (TNF-a, brady-kinin) stimulate eicosanoid production either by direct ac-tivation of PLA2, or indirectly by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, which in turn activate the enzyme. Ar-achidonic acid can be converted to these products by three different pathways: cyclooxygenase, leading to the forma-tion of prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes), li-pooxygenase, where leukotrienes and certain mono-, di- and tri-hydroxy acids are synthesized, and epoxygenase pathway, which includes cytochrome P-450 and epoxides as final products. Accordingly, cyclooxygenases, lipooxy-genases and epoxygenases are enzymes involved in these pathways (Smith, 1989). Cyclooxygenase (COX), impli-cated in cyclooxygenase pathway, exists in two forms, named COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitu-tively in different tissues, blood monocytes and platelets, and transforms arachidonic acid to prostanoids, which are involved in normal cellular homeostasis. In contrast, COX-2 may be induced by a series of pro-inflammatory stimuli and its role in the progress of inflammation, fever and pain has been known (Hawkey, 1999). Furthermore, three types of lipoxygenases, termed 5-, 12- and 15-lipoxygenase are engaged in lipoxygenase pathway. Some compounds, like 12(S)-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), a product of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), has influence on the regulation of platelet aggregation, but is also found to be involved in the progression of several hu-man diseases like various cancers (Nie and Honn, 2002) psoriasis (Muller, 1994) and rheumatoid arthritis (Liagre et al., 1997). Aforementioned enzymes can be found in dif-ferent cell types. Thus, in human platelets, COX-1 and 12-LOX are the initial enzymes responsible for arachidonic acid metabolism leading to the formation of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 12-HHT (12(S)-hy-droxy-(5Z,8E,10E)-heptadecatrienoic acid) and 12-HETE. In vitro technique for evaluation of anti-inflamatory activities of natural products and plants extractsSince our research is focused on biological activity of plant extracts, we aimed to evaluate and optimize an in vi-tro assay for anti-inflammatory activity, that can be easi-ly used to determine COX-1 and 12-LOX inhibitory po-tential of plant extracts or natural products, using LC-MS\/MS technique for quantification of metabolites and human platelets as a source of enzymes. We used human platelets as the cell system for testing anti-inflammatory activity of numerous plant extracts and secondary metabolites. Inflammation is induced by cal-cymicin (calcium ionophore A23187) with subsequent ad-dition of Ca2+. Detailed procedure is described in our previ-ous report (Beara et al., 2010; Lesjak et al., 2013). Consid-ering quantification of formed products, our research was focused on LC-MS\/MS technique in order to attain high sensitive and specific method with short analysis time. Furthermore, tandem mass spectrometry provides far bet-ter sensitivity and selectivity than traditional UV detectors S3 OP 114248Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 247 - 248 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionOral presentationsand does not depend on presence of chromophores. The method is optimized in order to get best performance for detection of PGE2, TXB2, 12-HHT (COX-1 pathway) and 12-HETE (12-LOX pathway) products, using PGB2 as in-ternal standard. The method performances were confirmed by measuring several parameters (Beara et al., 2010). The advantage and efficiency of this method was fur-ther confirmed through numerous subsequent studies on biological activity of natural plant products (Beara et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2014; Lesjak et al., 2011; Lesjak et al., 2013; Nadjpal et al., 2016, Simin et al., 2013). Further-more this method provides valuable information about the metabolism of arachidonic acid under inflammation. And finally, it should be noted that one of the important advan-tage of applied experiment is avoidance of undesirable in vivo tests on experimental animals.

All environmental media have naturally occur-ring mixtures of metals, and metals often are introduced into the environment as mixtures. Some of them are es-sential for maintaining proper health of humans, animals, plants, and microorganisms.Metals and inorganic requiring different approach-es for Environmental Hazard and Exposure assessments, compared to \"typical organic contaminants\". Several prop-erties and aspects of metals - their natural occurrence, es-sentiality, bioavailability, homeostatic control mechanisms and acclimatization to diverse natural environments, - re-quire specific recognition in the context of an environmen-tal risk assessment. The basic concept of ENV-Hazard and Risk Assessment of metals consist of four stages:- Classification & ranking (acute\/ chronic aquatic tox-icity, transformation \/dissolution, particle sizes, rank-ing systems, etc...);- Effects assessment (soil, sediment, water, data selec-tion, data handling, effects analysis, uncertainty man-agement, etc... sec. Poisoning...);- Exposure assessment (data selection, data handling, local scenario, regional scenario, waste scenario, etc... ) and- Risk characterization (soil sediment water sec. Poi-soning, local scenario, regional scenario, waste sce-nario, etc...) (USEPA, 2007).This paper will be short introduction to challenges and key concepts specific to metals environmental assessment, through specific parts on bioavailability, effects assess-ment, and bioaccumulation.BioavailabilityBioavailability should be taken into account for hazard and risk assessment of metal compounds in order to focus on interspecies sensitivity. A tired approach can be used, ensuring that first tier assessments use effects data where bioavailability is maximized (MERAG, 2007). Knowl-edge of the chemistry of a compound will normally guide the need for the development of bioavailability correction models. Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) can be used to esti-mate bioavailability, taking into account competition from other ions and binding of metals with natural organic mat-ter. Many countries have developed frameworks for tak-ing into account metal specificities in environmental risk assessment.Bioavailability models have a specific applicability domain and have to cover soil\/water parameters and back-ground relevant for the region where they are applied; in addition it may be needed to do checks with species spe-cific for that region. Further research is recommended to investigate to which extent commonalities between Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for species from different trophic levels apply amongst different metals. Further discussion is needed for developing a decision scheme as to the con-ditions for implementing BLMs in risk assessment.Effects assessmentHazard identification of metals and metal compounds is related to the toxicity of the soluble metal ions. The tox-icity of the metal ions and the release of these ions from the metal-containing substances are therefore used as a ba-sis for read-across.Effects assessments of metals could follow the follow-ing strategy: Data compilation & read-across- Data screening for relevancy and quality- Database developmentS3 OP 115250Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 249 - 250 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionOral presentations- Data normalization (i.e. Bioavailability correction) Data aggregation- Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) construction and HCX derivation if relevant PNEC derivation (in-cluding uncertainty assessment).- Metal-specific criteria for quality and relevancy of ef-fects data to be used in the assessment should be de-veloped, taking into account criteria already developed for chemicals effect data in general (MERAG,2007).Bioaccumulation and bioconcentrationFor some metals, background can be significant (rela-tive to the PEC or PNEC) and should be integrated in the risk assessment. At the level of PEC\/PNEC: the total bio-availability approach and the added risk approach could be considered; Background should be measured in unpollut-ed environments.Available data for BCFs and other Accumulation Fac-tors for metals indicate that they are inversely related to water (and sediment, and soil) concentrations. Therefore the use of a single value for assessing risks from secondary poisoning has to be considered.Measures of tissue concentrations along the food chain provide a useful way to assess secondary poisoning.Further discussion is needed as to how to improve comparisons\/interpretations of BCFs and BAFs for metals to regulatory threshold values.For the assessment of secondary poisoning, a tiered approach should be used, taking into account: dietary com-position for consumer organisms, high BCF values could be used as a trigger to perform more detailed assessments, relevant food chains should drive the selection of BAFs and oral PNEC values, bioavailability of the metal in the food or incidentally ingested soil\/sediment and the water concentration used in BCF or BAF experiments should preferably be in the same range as the PEC.ConclusionPresented key guiding principles is based on the unique attributes of metals. Metal speciation affects met-al behavior in environmental media. PH and redox poten-tial affect speciation. Kd values - a coefficient for mobili-ty in soils limited use of single values. Aging of metals in media reduces bioavailability."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","inner_id":9,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":10,"annotations":[{"id":10,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":1111,"end":1141,"text":"Laurocerasus

The toxicity of dimethoate results in deleterious effects caus-ing oxidative stress on many organs and systems in human and animals particularly the kidney, liver, testes, brain, ner-vous, and reproductive system (Abou-Baker et al., 2014). The cellular antioxidant defense is reinforced by the pres-ence of dietary antioxidants. Accordingly, there has been recently growing interest in the role and usage of natural antioxidants as a strategy to prevent oxidative damage in various health problems (Saafi et al., 2011).Laurocerasus officinalis Roem. is known as \"cher-ry laurel\" in English. L. officinalis is grown as a native fruit crop locally called \"taflan, lazkirazi, karayemis\"on the coasts of the Black Sea region of Turkey (Erdogan-Orhan and Kupeli-Akkol, 2011). The fruits and seeds of the L. officinalis are widely utilized as herbal medicine in Turkey for the treatment of stomach ulcers, digestive sys-tem problems, bronchitis (seeds), eczemas, hemorrhoids, anti-diabetic (seeds), analgesic on local pain, and as a di-uretic (fruits) (Ayaz et al., 1998; Elmastas et al., 2013; Kupeli-Akkol et al., 2012; Senayli et al., 2012; Yaylaci-Karahalil and Sahin, 2011). By in vitro models a neuropro-tective effect of the fruits of L. officinalis was found (Er-dogan-Orhan and Kupeli-Akkol, 2011). In vivo experimen-tal study determined the anti-inflammatory effects of L. of-ficinalis leaves (Kupeli-Akkol, 2012). L. officinalis fruit is rich in phenolics and a good source of natural antioxidant protecting humans from several diseases caused by oxida-tive stress (Yaylaci-Karahalil and Sahin, 2011). The aim of the study was to determine the nephrotoxic effects of dimethoate on biochemical indicators of kidney function tests, oxidative stress parameters, and histological examination in rats and the protective\/ameliorative effects of L. officinalis fruit extract. Materials and methods60 male Wistar albino rats were divided into six ex-perimental groups of 10 rats each and were treated daily by oral gavage for 60 days. Group I (control group) re-ceived only saline (0.9% NaCl); Group II was treated with dimethoate; Group III was given fruit extract; Group IV was treated with fruit extract and dimethoate; Group V was treated with vitamin C and dimethoate; Group VI was ad-ministrated only dimethoate for the first month. During the second month, the rats were treated with dimethoate and fruit extract. Dimethoate, L. officinalis fruit extract, and vitamin C were applied at 7, 4, and 100 mg\/kg\/day dos-es, respectively. At the end of the 60 days, rats were an-aesthetized by ketamine and xylazine. Blood samples were taken from hearts to the sterile tubes and centrifugated at 3500 rpm for 20 min to separate serum. The serum sam-ples were stored at -80 degC until analysis of blood urea ni-trogen (BUN) andcreatine. The kidneys were removed im-mediately and washed with sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). They are divided into two sections. One section was S3 OP 116252Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 251 - 252 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionOral presentationsplaced in formaldehyde solution for routine histopatholog-ic examination by light microscopy. The other half of kid-ney tissue section was homogenized in ten volumes of ice-cold 140 mMKCl and Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.6) us-ing a homogenizer for 2 min at 13.000 rpm. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) for lipid peroxidation index were determined in the tissue homogenates by using spectropho-tometer. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 5000 g for 60 min to remove debris. Clear supernatant was used for superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glu-tathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme activity assays. Results and discussionIn comparison to the control group, a statistically significant increase was observed in the serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatine in dimethote treat-ed group (p<0.05). However, administration of L. offici-nalis to dimethoate treated groups (group IV and VI) pro-vided a markedly reduction in levels of BUN and creatine (p<0.05). Moreover, vitamin C treated rats to dimethoate treated group showed decreased BUN and creatine lev-els (p<0.05).Treatment with dimethoate caused an increase in the kidney tissue levels of MDA as compared with the control group (p<0.05). However, treatment with L. officinalis to dimethoate treated groups (group IV and VI) provided a re-duction in MDA levels compared to the dimethoate treated group (p<0.05). The antioxidant enzymes activities of SOD and GPx in the group of only dimethote treated rats were significantly lower than those in the control group. Howev-er, L. officinalis treatment resulted in a significant increase of SOD and GPx activities (p<0.05). The activity of CAT enzyme was markedly decreased in dimethoate treated rats and elevated in L. officinalis treated rats as compared to control rats, but this effect was not statistically significant.The kidneys of the control group showed normal kid-ney parenchym. With light microscopic examinations, his-topathological changes such as mononuclear cell infiltra-tion, glomerular atrophy, congestion and necrosis in the kidney tissues were observed in the dimethoate treated group as compared with control group. Administration of L. officinalis apparently reduced kidney tissue damage. On the other hand, there were not any differences in histologic appearance of kidneys between the control and L. officina-lis treated group. Also, the kidney morphology in vitamin C treated group was similar to that of the control group.The antioxidants may play a major role in the preven-tion of diseases related to oxidative stress. Therefore, there is an increasing interest in the research of antioxidant com-pounds such as phenolics present in the plants (Erdogan-Orhan and Kupeli-Akkol, 2011). These phenolics provide protection against toxic radicals due to their radical scav-enger activities and have therapeutically beneficial effects on human health (Yaylaci-Karahaliland Sahin, 2011). It was found that L. officinalis fruit extract has strong radi-cal scavenging activity and antioxidant effects (Erdogan-Orhan and Kupeli-Akkol, 2011; Kolayli et al., 2003). ConclusionIn conclusion, dimethoate exposure indicated the dis-ruption of nephrotic architecture in kidney section as com-pared to control group. We observed that L. officinalis fruit extract pre- and post- administration to dimethoate treated rats significantly reduced kidney injury by preventing oxi-dative damage. Therefore, L. officinalis fruit may be useful for the prevention of oxidative stress-induced kidney injury.This research was financially supported by Research Fund of the Erciyes University Scientific Research Project Unit (Project number: TCD-2013-4127).ReferencesAbou-Baker, S., Assem, A.K., Sherif, R.M., Eldesouky, T.A. 2014.

In respect to probiotic foods both the viability of the probiotic within foods and bioavailability within the host has to be studied (Figueroa-Gonzalez et al., 2011), while at least maintaining the quality of conventional prod-uct used as a carrier. Microencapsulation may offer good protection of probiotic viability loss during manufacture, product storage and after ingestion of probiotics, especial-ly during exposure to unfavorable GI conditions (Sanchez et al., 2012).The aim of the study was to obtain a functional prod-uct ayran with therapeutic level of viable and metabolic ac-tive cells of L. casei 01 (a minimum of 107 log CFU per mL ayran). Quality of the prepared probiotic and synbiotic samples was examined as well as their therapeutic benefits in animal model with chemically induced colitis.Materials and methodsAyran samples were prepared by fortifying commer-cially available product (Ayran, Zdravje, Macedonia) with non-encapsulated probiotic L. casei 01 (Chr. Hansen, Den-mark) and\/or prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin (Syn-ergy 1, Orafti-Rue L. Marechal, Belgium) and encapsulat-ed synbiotic. Synbiotic microparticles were produced when an overnight activated culture in MRS broth (37 degC, 24 h) with a cell load ca. 11-12 log CFU\/mL in a mixture with 4% w\/w alginate (Protanal LF 10\/60 LS, fG 35-45%, FMC BioPolymer, IMCD, UK) and prebiotic (1.5% w\/w) was infused to the spray-dryer (Buchi Mini Spray Dryer B-290, SW). Spray-drying was performed at inlet and outlet tem-perature of 120 degC and 58+-3 degC, respectively, flow rate 6 ml\/min, nozzle diameter 0.7 mm, aspirator pressure 90% and atomizer pressure 600 Nlh-1. Polyelectrolyte com-plexation\/cross-linking of the dried powders was done un-der continuous stirring for at least 3 h with 0.5% w\/w chi-tosan (Chitine, France) and 5% w\/w CaCl2 (Merck, Ger-many) dissolved in 1% v\/v acetic acid. The hardened mi-croparticles were freeze-dried (-50 degC, 0.070 mbar, 24 h) (FreeZone Freeze Dry System, Labconco, USA) (Petres-ka Ivanovska et al., 2014). Analyses of the quality of ayran samples include determination of protein, fat and carbohy-drate content of the ayran by Bradford, Gerber and phenol-sulphuric acid methods, respectively, while the total solids were determined using gravimetric method. Titration acid-ity (lactic acid,%) and pH measurements were also eval-uated. AAS and HPLC was applied to quantify minerals and organic acid production, respectively. Then, to female Wistar rats (n=6, 180-250 g, 10-14 weeks old), function-al ayran samples (8.5-8.9 log CFU\/mL of the food prod-uct) were administered orally, once and twice daily. Plain ayran and drinking water were given to positive controls. Two weeks after starting the experiment, the rats were fast-ed overnight and those from the positive controls and treat-ed groups were rendered colitic. Colitis was induced intra-rectally at 8 cm proximal to the anus using TNBS (trinitro-benzenesulfonic acid) dissolved in 50% ethanol at a dose 10 and 30 mg\/kg."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","inner_id":10,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":11,"annotations":[{"id":11,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":16416,"end":16429,"text":"antimicrobial","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"Iisip1u4rQ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16431,"end":16448,"text":"anti-inflammatory","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"pk-t06hpYn","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16450,"end":16464,"text":"antirheu-matic","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"RwVA32uv7R","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16466,"end":16482,"text":"hepatoprotective","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"bRvT-84KjA","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16484,"end":16497,"text":"antimutagenic","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"ge6w_W-jfu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":16503,"end":16513,"text":"anticancer","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"DXzzA2neyD","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":12955,"end":12966,"text":"Antioxidant","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"5mYDtzx48e","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":11795,"end":11822,"text":"Hunteria umbellata k. schum","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"WOuFcwKBme","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":11735,"end":11752,"text":"Anti-inflammatory","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"ariBegWW7J","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":11395,"end":11408,"text":"antimicrobial","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"dk_VHUPfro","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":11413,"end":11430,"text":"anti-inflammatory","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"7Qfai2nUdj","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":11826,"end":11856,"text":"acute and chronic inflammation","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"ZGknyo5_53","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":15772,"end":15783,"text":"antioxidant","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"ygxuak2pqi","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":15602,"end":15614,"text":"antioxidants","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"QVIrNY-6XC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"from_id":"WOuFcwKBme","to_id":"ariBegWW7J","type":"relation","direction":"right","labels":["has_medicinal_effect"]},{"from_id":"WOuFcwKBme","to_id":"ZGknyo5_53","type":"relation","direction":"right","labels":["treats_medical_condition"]}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.215618Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.215618Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7476.6500000000015,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"6dd35be9-3e2d-466f-909e-03d56bf22f15","import_id":11,"last_action":null,"task":11,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"099b3cd5-ifra_reviewed_all.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Toxicity studiesOne of the most essential steps in the evaluation of a potential diagnostic\/therapeutic antibody is determination of the toxicity of an antibody (often radiolabelled) and the ratio of antibody uptake in the tumor versus normal tissues. This information is essential for the rational design of an-tibody conjugates therapy, where uptake of antibodies by normal tissues is crucial for predicting toxicity on one side, but also is crucial for defining dose regimen where optimal tumor concentration of the antibodies will be achieved on the other. S3 OP 119258Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 257 - 258 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionOral presentationsNormal and tumor tissue distribution can be quanti-fied and evaluated by toxicity studies in animal models, where kinetics, distribution and induced effects in mice\/rats or other nonrodent species, with or without implanted tumor are followed. These studies include administration of selected doses of radiolabelled mAbs and monitoring of tumor growth or survival of animals over time (Reilly et al., 2006). A control group of animals receives only the sol-vent of the formulation or non-specific radiolabelled mAbs of the same class. Generalized and gastrointestinal toxici-ty is followed by the weight monitoring (significant weight loss > 10-20%), while bone marrow toxicity is assessed by hematology analyses including leukocyte (WBC), erythro-cyte (RBC), and platelet counts as well as hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations. Biochemistry anal-yses included serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for liver toxicity and creatinine (Cr) levels for renal toxicity. In addition, samples from different tissues (liver, kidneys, etc) are obtained for hystopatological examination by light or electron microscopy. Potential radiotherapeutic agent should demonstrate specific anti-tumor effects targeted only tumor tissue with only minimal to moderate toxici-ty to normal tissues. ConclusionsVaried and newly designed antibody conjugates are currently directed toward various tumor targets in clinical trials, and more are nearing clinical trial. Before reaching any possibility for patient's treatment, successfully passed preclinical phase is essential. The future development of antibody conjugates as therapeutics in cancer treatment is dependent on data from laboratory studies, on applying in-novative approaches to target and antibody selection and on appropriate development strategies, leading at the end, to clinical benefit in cancer patients.Referencesde Bono, J.

In the field of environmental toxicology, the animals, also, play important roles in establishing the degree of tox-icity of the potential toxic agents. In the scientific research the mice are preferred as ani-mal models. The strain of mice is chosen by respecting dif-ferent conditions, such as: the type of experiment that will be performed, the susceptibility of the mice to develop the pathology or the signs specifics to the model desired, the mouse genetics, the lifespan and other factors experiment-related.The Cosorb process is known as the process used for the recovery of carbon monoxide (CO) from gas mixtures. This method requires an equimolar amount of CuCl and AlCl3 that will be added to an excess of toluene and the re-sult will be the formation of a CuAlCl4-toluene complex that is capable to fix CO (Foster, 2007). The objective of this study was to evaluate the pro-in-flammatory effect of the organic phase resulted during the Cosorb process by the means of ear-inflammation mouse model using 3 different strains of mice: Balb\/c, SKH-1 and C57BL\/6J mice. Materials and methodsFor this experiment there were used male Balb\/c, SKH-1 and C57BL\/6J mice weighing between 23-35g, purchased from Charles River Labs, Budapest, Hungary and housed in standard conditions in the Animal house Fa-cility from our University.The organic phase composition consists of the follow-ing aromatic volatile compounds: toluene (84.46%), xy-lems (5.3%) and benzene (0.1%). The ear-inflammation mouse model protocol proposed in this study was per-formed as described in the literature (Dkhil et al., 2010; Iyadomi et al, 2000) with several modifications. In brief, different volumes of the organic phase (20, 40 and 80 ul) were applied using a micro-pipette on the skin of the front and back of the right ear and the left ear was untreated in order to be used as control. The ear swelling was monitored for 24h post-application and at different time points: 2h, 4h, 8h and 24h were taken photos and the mice were weighed. At every time point mentioned, the mice were sacrificed under anesthesia and the both ears were cut off, sized and weighed. The increase in ear's weight determined by the organic phase application which represents the intensity of ear edema was calculated by subtracting the weight of the treated ear from that of the left ear, untreated, used as con-trol (Dkhil et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011).Samples from control and treated ears of mice were collected and fixed in formalin solution for histopathologi-cal analysis. The samples will be stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed. S3 OP 120260Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 259 - 260 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionOral presentationsResults and discussionThe aim of our study was to evaluate the pro-inflam-matory effects of the compounds found in the organic phase: toluene, xylene and benzene as a mixture of organic solvents by using animal models of ear inflammation. We decided to use three different strains of mice (Balb\/c, SKH-1 and C57Bl\/6J mice) to verify if the species variability in-fluences the effects of these compounds at skin level.Our data indicated the presence of erythema, swelling and edema, first signs being observable earlier than 2 hours post-application of the organic phase in all three strains of mice. The weights of the right ears treated with the organ-ic phase solution were bigger as compared to the left ears untreated used as controls, a marker of ear edema intensity. The capacity of inducing ear edema was dose dependent, the intensity of the effects being higher at the highest vol-umes added. In a previous study, we showed that topical applica-tion of organic and inorganic phases induced modifications in the physiological cutaneous parameters (hydration, tran-sepidermal waterloss and erythema) in a hairless SKH-1 mouse model (Coricovac et al., 2015; Simu et al., 2016). The use of xylene as an inducer of ear edema mouse model was associated with acute inflammation character-ized by severe vasodilation, edematous changes at skin level and infiltration of inflammatory cells (Igbe et al., 2010). Another signs of xylene toxicity at skin level after topical application were: increased vascular permeability, swelling within the dermis and proliferation of keratino-cytes (Dkhil et al., 2010). Iyadomi and coworkers showed that application of toluene to the ear skin of Balb\/c mice induced ear swelling and skin irritancy in a dose depen-dent manner (Iyadomi et al., 2000). Similar results were observed in our study, too.Toluene is an aromatic organic solvent known as an environmental toxicant. Inhalation of toluene was associat-ed with airway inflammation and neurotrophin production in hippocampus of mice. Benzene and xylene induce irri-tation of the airway and dizziness in humans. Volatile or-ganic compounds as toluene, benzene and xylene were de-scribed as substances able to determine inflammatory re-sponses at pulmonary level, but also to modulate neurolog-ical responses in brain (Wang et al., 2012).According to the literature, Balb\/c mice are suscepti-ble to develop tumors, like mammary and colon cancer, to infection diseases and as animal models for ear edema studies by the dermal application of different inflammatory agents (Chen et al., 2005; Iyadomi et al., 2000).SKH-1 hairless mice are a strain used very often in studies concerning the development of skin cancers and, in pathologies involving skin changes, due to the fact that the lack of hair offers a better observation of the changes that occur.ConclusionOur preliminary data indicate that the application of the organic solvents mixture induced ear inflammation in all three strains of mice used in the study. The information obtained in the present study is valuable, especially from the point of toxicity that might develop by the workers in the industry of CO recovery and, in addition, this mixture could be used as an agent for animal model of ear edema in order to test the anti-inflammatory effects of different compounds.AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by the PN-II-PT-PC-CA-2013-4-0612 grant, nr. 110\/2014 (REMACAT).ReferencesDkil, M.A., Abdel-Baki, A.S., Al-Quirashi, S.,Al-Khalifa, M., 2010.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are strongly related with the onset of dis-eases such as cancers, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, diabe-tes, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, idiopathic pulmo-nary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.ROS are produced from molecular oxygen as a result of the normal cellular metabolism in living organisms or as a result of environmental factors. The three major types of ROS that are of physiological significance are superox-ide anion, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide. They are essential for the physiological signaling pathways and other cell processes. However, these highly reactive mol-ecules, if present at high concentrations, damage the cell structures (such as lipids, proteins, nucleic acids) and al-ter their functions. The disbalance between the oxidant and antioxidant effects inside a viable cell in favor of the oxi-dants is described with the term \"oxidative stress\". Oxida-tive stress occurs when the balance between antioxidants and ROS is disrupted because of either depletion of anti-oxidants or accumulation of ROS. Consequently, high con-centrations of ROS result in a higher degree of oxidative stress leading to many pathological conditions.Aerobic organisms have integrated antioxidant sys-tems that are usually effective in blocking the harmful ef-fects of ROS. If present in small quantities, antioxidants are powerful agents that can prevent or reduce the oxida-tive destruction of biomolecules. Generally, antioxidants can be divided in two categories: enzymatic and nonen-zymatic. The major enzymatic antioxidants are superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin, glutathione transferase. Nonenzymatic an-tioxidants include vitamins C and E, b-carotene, uric acid, and glutathione. However, in pathological conditions, the antioxidant systems can be overwhelmed, causing disbal-ance of ROS\/antioxidant index. Consequently, additional source of antioxidants is essential, to enhance the metabo-lism against the excess of free radicals.Natural sources of antioxidantsBeside the many benefits of the plant utilization for different reasons, herbs have been identified as sources of various phytochemicals, many of which cause antioxidant effects. For a very long time, herbs were the only medici-nal therapy that people used in the treatment of various dis-eases. Although synthetic drugs were developed in the 19th century and replaced herbal therapy in many fields of treat-ment, herbs are still found in 40% of prescription drugs. Additionally, herbs are also used in the cosmetics industry, food industry and chemical industry. Herbs and spices are reliable sources of potential bio-active compounds in human diet. Research indicates that these bioactive components may act alone or in combina-tion with other bioactive moieties to reduce disease risk through their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antirheu-matic, hepatoprotective, antimutagenic, and anticancer ac-tivities."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.209446Z","inner_id":11,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":12,"annotations":[{"id":12,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":13118,"end":13135,"text":"Capsicum annum L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"Mkvrai1F8X","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.215618Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.215618Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3369.856,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"2acec070-f7df-4f24-8d9b-e8a5bca4f487","import_id":12,"last_action":null,"task":12,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"099b3cd5-ifra_reviewed_all.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"SKH-1 mice are a variety of unpigmented and immuno-competent mice which are characterized by a more perme-able skin than the human one. Their skin is less permeable to benzo[a]pyrene than the skin of haired mice. Moreover, a prolonged in vitro hydration of their skin can generate a consistent increase in permeability, particularly to polar or ionized solutes. The C57BL\/6N mice were used in order to emphasize the differences between pigmented skin model and the SKH-1's ones.Corneometry is a non-invasive technique which is able to estimate the hydration level of the skin surface (mainly at the stratum corneum level). The measurements associ-ated to this technique offer valuable information onto the modifications of the dielectric constant, due to skin surface hydration changing. So, this method presents a great deal of interest in dermatological and cosmetic applications, but also in formulation, claim support and efficacy testing of moisturizers. Corneometry is of great importance in objec-tive clinical diagnosis, as well as for monitoring therapies. The obtained results from the Corneometric study showed a significant decrease of the skin's hydration level in both types of mice, as well as for both studied aggressors (inorganic and organic phases). This decrease was noticed after the first 24 hours after application of the test solution, in both animal models. The decrease of this parameter may be associated to some toxicity signs, or may indicate the apparition of different injuries at skin level. It is important to note that in the case of the mice topically treated with the inorganic phase, some skin colour changes were noticed. Nowadays, Tewametry is used for many purposes, in-cluding dermatology (for objective clinical diagnosis) and occupational medicine, for monitoring and detecting skin damages, as well as in the testing of cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals. Through this technique, the TEWL parameter is assessed. This parameter brings information onto the skin's intrinsic properties, especially as its water barrier function. The measurements evaluate the density gradient of the water evaporation from the skin indirectly, by means of temperature and relative humidity. Great val-ues of this parameter indicate that the water barrier func-tion of the skin become inefficient, or even some stratum corneous deteriorations. It was found that increased TEWL values can be associated with different skin diseases, but could be also induced by different chemical compounds. The evolution of the TEWL parameter was studied both for the inorganic phase solution and the organic one. The obtained results indicate a significant decrease of this parameter in both cases. In the case of both animal mod-els, it was noticed that the organic phase induced cutane-ous damages after only 2 weeks after exposition (2 weeks). However, the progress of lesions was slightly decreased when medical treatment was applied at this stage.ConclusionModifications of skin surface hydration level, and of the TEWL parameter were induced by the topical applica-tion of inorganic and organic phase solutions resulted from the Cosorb process. These results were more obvious in the case of the SKH1 mice model, and could be associated with the first signs of a short-term pathology at the skin's level.AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by the PN-II-PT-PC-CA-2013-4-0612 grant, nr. 110\/2014 (REMACAT).ReferencesChadeesingh, R., 2011.

The World Health Organization (WHO) strongly supports breastfeed-ing for newborns from birth until 6 months postpartum as a global public health recommendation. Sometimes mothers are unable to make enough milk for the infant feeding and in such a case, milk-based infant formulas might be used as supplement to breast milk or may also be used as substi-tute if breastfeeding is impossible. Human milk provides the normative standard for infant nutrition with its unique composition that differs from infant formulas, although nu-trient composition of infant formulas is generally based to have similar functional properties as breast milk. Infant formula is a product based on milk of cows or other animals and\/or other ingredients which have been proven to be suitable for infant feeding. Nowadays, a wide variety of infant formulas are available, so its nutritional safety and adequacy should be scientifically demonstrated to support normal growth and development of infants, es-pecially during the first 6 month of age. Infant formula is not officially a pharmaceutical prod-uct, though in many cases the manufacturers are pharma-ceutical companies. Regulatory bodies around the world agree that continual nutrient analysis is crucial in infant formulas quality control. The nutritional composition of all infant formulas must fulfill the global standards recom-mended by the European Society for Paediatric Gastroen-terology, Hepatology and Nutrition's (ESPGHAN) interna-tional expert group that was commissioned by The Codex Alimentarius Commission. These documents contain data about minimum and maximum values of nutrient contents in infant formulas with the goal to provide safe and nu-tritionally adequate infant formula products that meet the nutritional requirements of healthy babies during the first months of life until the introduction of appropriate comple-mentary feeding (Owens et al., 2012).Thiamine (vitamin B1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2) are nutritional components present in both breast milk and in-fant formulas which support normal infant growth. Thia-mine pyrophosphate as biologically active form of vitamin B1, is a cofactor for a number of key enzymes in Krebs cy-cle and in pentose phosphate pathway. Riboflavin is a pre-cursor of the flavin coenzymes, flavin adenine dinucleo-tide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), which par-ticipate in oxidation-reduction reactions in many meta-bolic pathways. As FAD is part of the respiratory chain, riboflavin is central to energy production. Both vitamins are essential for development of infant tissues, function of muscles, heart, nervous system and mental activity. Also they are involved in carbohydrates, lipid and protein me-tabolism, red blood cell formation, respiration, antibody production and normal infant growth (Lalic et al., 2014; Sunaric et al., 2012). The levels of these vitamins in infant formulas are very important for term infants during the first 6 months of life, and especially for pre-term or low birth weight infants.The aim of this work was to determine thiamine and ri-boflavin content in some infant formulas available in Ser-bian pharmacies, as well as to define the level to which these infant formulas comply with the ESPGHAN recom-mendations and with Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI) for infants.S3 PP 128276Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 275 - 276 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionPoster presentationsMaterials and methodsTen most commonly used standard infant formulas were purchased from a local pharmacy. All analyzed brands were initial milk-based formulas designed for infant con-sumption during the first 6 months of life. Powdered sam-ples were dissolved and prepared following manufactur-er's instructions, in order to attain vitamins concentrations as given on the label.Samples preparation procedures and vitamins content analysis were done according to our previously published methods with minor modifications (Lalic et al., 2014; Sunaric et al., 2012). The percentage of compliance has been calculated with the mean minimum and maximum levels of vitamins according to ESPGHAN recommendations using the for-mula: Composition in 100 ml infant formula\/ ESPGHAN mean value by 100 ml x 100.Results and discussionVitamins contents in analyzed samples were expressed as micrograms (mg) per 100 ml of prepared milk, as given on the label. The concentrations of thiamine and ribofla-vin in herein examined infant formulas were in the range of 57.5-91.3 mg\/100 ml and 106.7-224.8 mg\/100 ml, re-spectively. Also, values obtained for thiamine and ribofla-vin content in all samples accounted for over 88.5% of the values declared on the product label, with good precision (RSD < 1.8%, n = 5).The amounts of both vitamins in all analyzed samples exceeded the minimum requirements according to ESP-GHAN recommendations (48 mg\/100 ml for thiamine and 180 mg\/100 ml for riboflavin). The percentage of compli-ance was in the range of 39.9-63.4% for vitamin B1 and 19.8-41.6% for vitamin B2, respectively. These results were within the acceptable limits found in most of the lit-erature and very similar compared to the data in other stud-ies conducted according to ESPGHAN recommendations.Recommended Dietary Intake for infants (0-6 months old) are 200 mg\/day for thiamine and 300 mg\/day for ribo-flavin. Thus, assuming that the advised daily intake of 500 ml of prepared infant formula is optimal for 0- to 6-month infants, all analyzed samples supply much higher lev-els than the values established by the RDI for B1 (143.7-228.2%) and B2 (177.8-374.6%).ConclusionIn this work, thiamine and riboflavin content in differ-ent infant formulas available in Serbian pharmacies was determined. Levels of both vitamins in all samples were consistent with the values declared on the products label. Results of this study revealed that analyzed infant formu-las comply with the nutritional needs of infants with regard to vitamins B1 and B2. Their content in all samples ex-ceeds the RDI values, so there is an excess of these nutri-ents supplementation. Moreover, the satisfactory compli-ance with ESPGHAN recommendations was observed so analyzed milk-based formulas might be used as adequate breast milk supplements or substitutes.AcknowledgmentThis research was supported by grant TR 31060 from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological De-velopment of the Republic of Serbia.References Lalic, J., Denic, M., Sunaric, S., Kocic, G., Trutic, N., Mitic, S., Jovanovic, T., 2014.

The determination of pesticides in fruits and vegetables has always been an important issue in ensuring the quality of the products, given the fact that residues of pesticides in raw food could affect the consummator (Abbassy et al., 2014). Neonicotinoid insecticides, which have a high affinity for insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Matsuda et al., 2001) are widely used to protect against a broad range of pests, including aphids, whitefly, thrips and mealy bugs. Their physicochemical properties make them useful for a wide range of application techniques, including seed treatment, soil drench, and foliar and stem application (Tomlin, 2009). Because some pesticides can be applied to crops up to the day before harvest, the residual pesticide concentrations in crops immediately after harvest may be relatively high. Among the neonicotinoid pesticides commercially available, imidacloprid and acetamiprid are of common use in our region. This study focuses on the residuals of acetamiprid on green peppers (Capsicum annum L.) one of the most important vegetable crops in our country. Various methods for neonicotinoid insecticide residue analysis have been reported, demonstrating that acetamiprid could be analyzed by both gas and liquid chromatography (Mateu-Sanchez et al., 2003; Navalon et al., 1997; Obana et al., 2002). According to the recommendation issued by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)\/WHO the Maximum Residual Levels (MLR) for acetamiprid in vegetables should not exceed 0.2 mg\/kg. Materials and methodsThe study was conducted in a ventilated and temperature regulated greenhouse. The surface involved approximately 250 m2 and was divided in three main sections consisting of 30 plants each: S1 - untreated plants; S2 - plants treated with the minimal dose of acetamiprid (Mospilan(r)) 0,02%; and S3 - treated with the maximal dose of acetamiprid (Mospilan(r)) 0,04%. Considering that the Pre Harvest Interval (PHI) for acetamiprid is 7 days, the residual levels have been measured up to 9 days after spraying with two different concentrations of Mospilan(r). Sampling was conducted in compliance with the guidelines published by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CCPR, 2009).Approximately 300 g of vegetables were chopped into small pieces and blended in a homogenization apparatus so that a fine paste is formed. A portion of 5 g was accurately weighted and mixed with 10 g of hard-powdered synthetic magnesium-silica gel (Florisil(r)) in a mortar. Cleanup was carried out using a chromatographic column. The column (40 cm x 20 mm) was carefully prepared placing at the end glass wool and a thin layer of anhydrous sodium sulphate (Kadenezki et al., 1992). The column was then packed by transferring the mixture prepared in the mortar using a funnel. Extract was eluted with 50 ml of ethyl acetate and acetone mixture and elute was evaporated to dryness on rotary evaporator and reconstituted in 1ml hexane. The cleaned extracts were analyzed on a Shimadzu gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with capillary column using an electron capture detector (ECD) (Chandra et al., 2010). Analysis of acetamiprid was carried out in a 30 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter and 0.25 um film thickness coated DB-5 column. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 ml min-1 flow. The injector was set at constant temperature of 260 degC and the detector temperature was S3 PP 129278Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 277 - 278 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionPoster presentations300 degC. The initial oven temperature was set at 170degC (1 min isothermal) then the temperature increased with a ramp of 10 degC\/ min till 280 degC and subsequently isothermal for 15 minutes. The injection volume was 1ul. All the solvent used were HPLC grade.Results and discussionThe compound of interest was identified by comparing its retention time with respect to technical grade reference standard. The elution time for acetamiprid under the chosen chromatographic conditions was 7.29 min. The quantitative determination was carried out with the help of a calibration curve drawn from chromatographic experiments with standard solutions. The limit of quantification (LoQ) was measured by the signal to noise ratio and was 0.01 mg\/ml (ppm). The method was validated. Linear calibration curve was found between peak areas and analyte concentration in the whole range of the study. The linear regression (y = a + bx) parameters for method calibration were taken and the regression coefficients (R2) was near 0.998, which allows the quantification of this compound by the method of external standardization.

In the sam-ples containing microparticles enumeration was done after removing the particles by filtration, washing with sterile saline solution and liquefying with phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). The pH values of synbiotic samples were also exam-ined (pH meter PB 11 Sartorius, Germany). The production of lactic and acetic acid was measured using HPLC (Agile-nt Technologies 1200, USA) by loading supernatants of the pretreated samples with 0.5 M H2SO4 on a reverse phase column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mm, Discovery HS C 18, Su-pelco Park, USA) set at 40 degC and eluted with 0.005 M H2SO4 at a flow rate of 1 mL\/min with detection wave-length of 210 nm.Results and discussionEncapsulated L. casei 01 added to ayran either carrot juice survived significantly better compared to non-encap-sulated cells upon cold storage due to the ability of chito-san-coated alginate particles to preserve cell viability. Rel-atively high viable cell counts in carrot juice and ayran at the end of storage were observed, 9.11 and 8.22 log CFU\/mL, respectively. The viability of free and encapsulated L. casei 01 in ayran samples was reduced for 3.38 and 1.21 log CFU\/mL, respectively, while the corresponding cell vi-ability loss in carrot juices was 1.49 and 0.44 log CFU\/mL. Results have shown that both non-encapsulated and encap-sulated L. casei 01 survived better in carrot juice compared to ayran. This finding may be the result of characteristics of probiotic strain or substrate as well as the oxygen con-tent in the product. Acidity of the carrot juice as substrate was determined to be lower than ayran acidity (pH 6.25 vs. 4.55, respectively). The mild acidity of carrot juice de-clined to 4.23 and 5.44 after fermentation with free and en-capsulated L. casei 01, respectively, while pH values mea-sured in ayran samples enriched with free and encapsulat-ed L. casei 01 were 4.54 and 4.58, respectively. The reduc-tion of pH values was similar in both carrot juice or ayran samples during the storage, but ayran contains 0.4% salt which may contribute to further reduction of the cell via-bility. Probiotic culture L. casei 01 produced higher quan-tity of lactic acid in ayran samples compared to carrot juice samples due to the presence of lactose in dairy products. In ayran samples containing non-encapsulated and encap-sulated synbiotic, the concentration of lactic acid tend to increase during storage from initial values of 51.32 and 56.94 mmoL\/L to 59.14 and 72.36 mmoL\/L, respective-ly. Production of acetic acid was lower, but with similar in-creasing trend to those of lactic acid. As the result of sac-charolytic activity of the probiotic culture able to ferment sugars present in the carrot juice, production of lactic and acetic acid was observed. Initially measured concentra-tion of 30.53 mmoL\/L lactic acid remained constant during the storage of the carrot juice containing non-encapsulat-ed synbiotic, while initial concentration of 18.43 mmoL\/L lactic acid of the sample with encapsulated synbiotic in-creased to 31.53 mmoL\/L at the end of storage. In the car-rot juice samples both containing non-encapsulated or en-capsulated synbiotic, the concentration of acetic acid was significantly lower compared to corresponding ayran sam-ples and tend to decrease during the storage period. How-ever, in both dairy either non-dairy product, the metabolic activity of L. casei 01 was better retained in samples with encapsulated synbiotic as lactic acid is the main product of lactobacilli metabolism.ConclusionSurvival rate of the encapsulated L. casei 01 incor-porated in carrot juice as well in ayran was found to be above the therapeutic level with retained metabolic cell activity during the investigation period. The results have shown higher probiotic viability in carrot juice compared to ayran, albeit dairy products are naturally connected with lactic acid bacteria. Further, synbiotic carrot juice may be offered to lactose intolerant individuals and to those suffer-ing from cardiovascular diseases. Additional studies to in-vestigate the influence of the food matrix in preserving cell viability under gastrointestinal conditions as well the abil-ity of the matrix to deliver viable cells to the lower intes-tine are required.ReferencesDo Espirito Santo, A.P., Perego, P., Converti, A., Oliveira, M.N., 2011.

It has been reported that the consumption of low alcohol wines had a very positive effect on the consumer's health. Thus, Karatzi (Karatzi et al., 2004), showed that the consump-tion of 250 mL per day of alcohol free wine has improved the condition of the cardio-vascular system in patients with a progressive coronary disease. There are, also, literature data witnessing the benefit of alcohol free wine consump-tion and its connection with lowering the high blood pres-sure (Chiva-Blanch et al., 2012). In order to produce low or alcohol free wines, food in-dustry applies several pre-fermentative, during and post-fermentative procedures. Post-fermentative techniques are usually physical like pervaporation or utilization of spin-ning cone column, but all of these processes have draw-backs such are specific and expensive equipment and changes in aromatic composition (Heux et al., 2006).Unlike post-fermentative, pre-fermentative enzymatic methods for lowering the alcohol level in wines are fast-er, high specific methods that minimize loss or alteration of sensory qualities and off-flavor development (Schmid-ke et al., 2012). In this paper the effect of glucose concentration in the minimal model must on the enzymatic activity of sever-al different commercial glucose oxidase preparations was examined. The first one was the commercial bakery addi-tive Alphamalt Gloxy 5080 (glucooxidase and low catalase activity). The second one was pure glucooxidase from the mould Aspergillus niger and the third preparation was cou-pled mould glucooxidase and a beef liver catalase. The glu-cose concentration of 10 g\/L and 100 g\/L were used as sug-ar concentrations in the minimal model must. The effect of the enzyme activity on the final pH of the reaction media was also studied.Materials and methodsEnzymatic preparations: Alphamalt Gloxy 5080 (Muhlenchemie, Germany) was a commercial enzyme preparation obtained from Aspergillus niger strain. This was a food grade bakery additive with activity of 10500 units per gram (U\/g) and low catalase activity. The pure glucose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.4) was in its ly-ophilized form and was also derived from Aspergillus ni-ger (Merck, Germany). This preparation was with much lower activity than the previous one. The activity of the ly-ophilized glucose oxidase was 8 U\/mg. The liquid catalase (Merck, Germany) was obtained from beef liver and had an activity of 1300000 U\/mL. Media: A medium with high glucose concentration of 100 g\/L was prepared. This high concentration was chosen to be of the same order of magnitude as the one measured in the real must. For comparison, the medium with low-er concentration of glucose of 10 g\/L was also used. The minimal model must, besides glucose, was also containing 4.0 g\/L tartaric acid, 1.5 g\/L malic acid and 0.5 g\/L citric acid. The pH of the medium was adjusted to pH 3.5 using sodium hydroxide (10 M NaOH) to be similar as the pH of the real must.Glucose oxidase reaction: All the three preparation used were diluted in the medium to give a certain concen-tration of the enzyme preparation. The reactions were car-S3 PP 134288Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 287 - 288 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionPoster presentationsried on an orbital shaker (Ceromat R, B. Brown Biotech In-ternational) with agitation rate of 150 rpm (oxygen disso-lution) in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of medium. The reaction temperature was kept 30 degC.Determination of glucose concentration: D-glucose was measured using DNS method for determination of reduced sugars (Miller, 1959). The absorbance was mea-sured on a spectrophotometer Cary 50 Scan (Varian) at 540 nm wave length.Determination of pH value: The pH value of the media was determined by utilization of Sartorius Basic pH Meter PB-11. The pH value was determined at the beginning (ini-tial pH value) and at the end of the enzymatic reaction (fi-nal pH value).Results and discussionEnzymatic reaction in the minimal model must with 10 g\/L glucoseThe effect of the lower concentration of glucose, 10 g\/L, on the enzymatic activity was evaluated by utilizing three different glucose oxidase preparations in the medi-um simulating a must (minimal model must). Those were Alphamalt Gloxy 5080, pure glucose oxidase and the third one was a combination of glucose oxidase and catalase. The most active of all the three was the commercial Alpha-malt Gloxy 5080 preparation, showing even 71.12% con-version at the 24th hour of the reaction. Unlike the Alpha-malt Gloxy 5080, the other two glucose oxidase prepara-tions showed negligible activity towards the glucose sub-strate used in the concentration of 10 g\/L. It was, thus, ob-vious, that not even the presence of catalase could increase the activity of the pure glucose oxidase, in this, not favor-able conditions for the enzyme activity (pH 3.5).Enzymatic reaction in the minimal model must with 100 g\/LIn the second experiment, ten times higher concentra-tion of glucose was used, as it was actually necessary to simulate the concentration of glucose present in the real must (approx. 100 g\/L glucose+100 g\/L fructose). None of the three enzymatic preparations used was active enough at this high concentration of glucose. However, the Alpha-malt Gloxy 5080 showed certain activity. Namely, during the reaction period of 120 hours it converted only 7.37% of the substrate. It can be assumed that for the conversion of glucose into gluconic acid in media with high glucose con-centration, at these unfavorable conditions for glucose ox-idase activity, the acidic environment, high concentrations of enzyme preparation, preferably Alphamalt Gloxy 5080, should be used. The pH value of the media and its difference between the initial and the final value (after the reaction), is also a good indirect indicator of the enzymatic activity. Thus, the very logical results were obtained when the pH value of the medium containing 100 g\/L was used as a minimal model must. Only a very slight difference in the pH value (from 3.55 to 3.50) was measured in the medium with coupled glucose oxidase\/ catalase enzymatic system used as a cata-lyst. It was interesting that the Alphamalt Gloxy 5080 has changed the pH value of the medium from 3.50 to pH 3.00, and it was the most active enzymatic preparation among the three examined.ConclusionThe effect of glucose concentration on the enzyme ac-tivity was evaluated by utilization of three different enzy-matic preparations. It was found out that the commercial bakery additive Alphamalt Gloxy 5080 was the most suit-able enzymatic preparation for glucose oxidation, at as low pH of the medium as pH 3.5, although even this enzymatic preparation was not very active at the higher glucose con-centration (100 g\/L). This paper is only a part of the com-plex research process for development of a sophisticated method for pre-fermentative lowering of the sugar concen-tration in the must, with a final aim- production of low al-cohol wine.

Although heavy metals are usually present in foods at very low levels, long-term exposure can have negative health impacts. According to the Macedonian regulations for gen-eral requirements for food safety, determination of cadmi-um (Cd) and lead (Pb) are obligatory. It can enter food ei-ther through environmental processes or through contami-nation in processing and\/or packaging. Therefore, it is very important to measure levels of Cd and Pb in a variety of food matrices.

This is due to a decreased urinary creatinine excretion as a result of reduced lean body mass rather than to renal dysfunction. Plasma urea concentration and urinary protein excretion increase with age. In addition to differences in gender specific hormones, differences also exist in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters. Plasma concentrations of amino acids, urea, uric acid and creatinine are higher in males than in females. Clinical chemistry analytes are greatly influenced by diet and drinking. A high-protein diet increases plasma urea, serum cholesterol, and phosphate concentrations. In contrast, starvation, fasting and malnutrition also induce clinically significant changes in analytes concentrations. Long-term starvation entails decreased concentrations of blood protein, cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins, and urea. On the other hand, the concentrations of creatinine and uric acid increase. Urinary excretion of ammonia and creatinine is increased, whereas the excretion of urea, calcium and phosphate is reduced. Due to the decreased skeletal mass, serum concentrations of urea and creatinine as well as creatinine clearance are reduced. Hemolysis can cause an interference factor for the analysis of creatinine. Also, bilirubin can cause false positive results in creatinine determination.ConclusionFrom this data for creatinine, with the usage of the t-test, we can conclude that there are significant differences in results between different age groups and gender, but there is no significance in results for urea for participants with age of 50-65 in both male and female groups.The inter-individual variations for creatinine are 15,64% and for urea are 26,94%. The range of variability in serum creatinine between individuals in this study is between 61,57-100,4 umol\/L for male participants and 50,9-82,66 umol\/L for female, but according to the kit documentation creatinine levels should be 62-106 umol\/L for male and 44-80 umol\/L for female. For urea this range is between 2,08-7,64 mmol\/L (2,6-6,5 mmol\/L by the kit documentation).It is of great importance that physicians be aware of these factors, because the final interpretation of the analyses and decisions on therapeutic procedures based on this interpretation actually lead to the physician's final judgment. In this process, the laboratory should act as a reliable and consistent collaborator.ReferencesHosten, O.A., 1990.

Worldwide urine screening tests use for preliminary re-sults of opiate abuse for employees in the workplace, ath-letes in doping control and etc. (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Lum and Mushlin, 2004). However, existing problem in interpreting the results of opiate urine analysis arises be-cause immunoassays screening tests have high sensitivity but lower specificity because of cross-reactivity with sub-stances other than the drugs in question (Lum and Mush-lin, 2004). Therefore, it is well known that positive opi-ate results may be obtained during drugs of abuse screen-ing related to certain drugs and food intake (EFSA, 2011; Jankovicova et al., 2009; Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Lum and Mushlin, 2004). Seeds of the opium poppy plant are legally sold and widely consumed as food. Morphine and codeine are nat-urally occurring substituent of the poppy plant, Papa-ver somniferum. The opiate content of poppy seeds var-ies greatly and is dependent on the seed origin and meth-od processing (EFSA, 2011; Samano et al., 2015). Due to contamination during harvesting, the seeds can contain morphine and other opiate alkaloids (Lachenmeier et al., 2010). Literature data and our previous case study indi-cate that consummation of both, raw poppy seeds and bak-ing mixtures, induce positive immunoassay test for opiates (Dukic-Cosic et al. 2014; Jankovicova et al., 2009; Sama-no et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2014). However, the time pe-riod during which it is possible to obtain false positive opi-ates results is not yet sufficiently understood.The purpose of this case study was to determine time period of presence of opiates in urine after the consump-tion of product which contain poppy seed using immuno-assay test and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\/MS) technique. Materials and methodsFemale participant age between 20 and 25 years with-out previous known history of substance abuse provided written informed consent to participate in this case study. Participant consumed a piece of strudel with poppy seeds from a local bakery in the morning on the first day and collected ad libitum each urine sample during next three days. Urine samples (n=8) were collected 5, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60 and 72 hours after strudel ingestion. Specimens were analyzed with the Opiates Test Card (MP Biomed-icals, LLC, California) immunoassay at 300 ng\/mL cut-offs, and all positive samples were quantified for morphine and codeine by LC\/MS. Urine specimen was prepared us-ing liquid\/liquid extraction of opiate by mixture of chloro-form and isopropanol (9 : 1; v\/v). Extracts were analyzed by LC\/MS technique: separation column Waters Spheri-sorb 5 mm, ODS2, 4.6 x 100 mm; mobile phase: ammo-nium acetate:acetonitrile (80 : 20; v\/v), mobile phase flow rate 0.3 mL\/min; mass detection range: 100-400 m\/z.S3 PP 154328Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 327 - 328 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe screening immunoassay test for opiates (cutoff 300 ng\/mL) was positive for all investigated urine samples. These results in accordance with previous studies that pop-py-seed food products, such as poppy-seed strudels, may cause a true-positive immunoassay screening test for opi-ates due to the presence of low, but still detectible, levels of opium alkaloids (Lum and Mushlin, 2004). The morphine content in poppy seeds from around the world is variable (0.1-294 mg\/g), and exposure concentrations depend on poppy seed origin, harvesting procedure and the method of poppy seed foodstuffs preparation (Samano et al., 2015; Thevis et al., 2003). Significant reductions in opiate con-tent have been documented after food preparative process-es, with decreased drug concentration shown after wash-ing, soaking, grinding and baking (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Samano et al., 2015). To minimize the number of positive opiate tests resulting from poppy seed consump-tion, cutoff concentration for morphine and codeine raised from 300 to 2,000 ng\/mL (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Sa-mano et al., 2015). However, only screening immunoassay test for opiates with lower cutoff (300 ng\/mL) are avail-able in our country. In all investigated urine samples, morphine and co-deine concentrations were determined by LC\/MS. The following values were obtained for morphine: 0.25, 0.06, 0.05, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02, 0.01 and 0.01 mg\/L, and codeine 0.07, 0.09, 0.06, 0.02, 0.009, 0.008, 0.001, 0.001 mg\/L, re-spectively. The highest measured concentration of mor-phine and codeine was obtained at 5 and 12 hours, respec-tively. This is in agreement with literature data that peak concentrations of morphine and codeine appeared 4-12 hours after consumption of poppy seed (Lachenmeier et al., 2010). However, for interpreting urine opiate results need to know that measured concentrations of morphine and codeine after the consumption of products which con-tain poppy seed are noticeably lower then concentrations of opiates which can be measured in urine of opiate abus-ers. Furthermore, presence of heroin metabolite 6-mono-acetylmorphine can be detected in urine of opiate abusers using LC\/MS or GC\/MS techniques (Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Samano et al., 2015). In contrast to results of this case, the most studies with intake of poppy seeds, raw and cakes, shows that urine samples were negative by 20 hours after consumption (Jankovicova et al., 2009; Lachenmeier et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014). Present data show that, even 72 hours after the oral intake of strudel containing poppy seeds, the urinary level of opiate alkaloids can be detectible. Namely, approx-imate detection time of opiates of abuse in urine is up to three days and these data demonstrated that opiates can be detected in urine after consumption poppy seed stru-del during the same time period as in users of psychoactive substances. Thevis et al. (2003) also demonstrated positive opiate urine at 48 h after consumption a typical poppy seed cake with high morphine content (151.6 mg\/kg). The con-sumption of poppy seed products in those out-of-competi-tion time spaces might be considered as non problematic, but the long length of stay of opiates in urine samples can lead to positive doping results in competition tests up to three days after oral intake of cakes with poppy seeds (The-vis et al., 2003; Lachenmeier et al., 2010). ConclusionThe results of the present case study support previous findings and confirm that opiates can be detected in urine after consumption popular poppy seed strudel. However, these data indicates that time period of presence of opiates in urine can be prolonged after consumption of this prod-uct. This finding should be taken into account in routine testing of employees in the workplace, members of the mil-itary, students in schools, as well as athletes.

Capitata) is a vegeta-ble crop, economically important in Republic of Macedo-nia. In nutrition, it is used in fresh or processed state.Dobricevic et al. (2006), have determined the chem-ical composition of 100 g of cabbage, where the amount of vitamin C ranges from 20 to 100 mg\/100 g, dry mat-ter content from 5% to 9%, fiber 1.0% to 1.7%. Accord-ing to Rumeza et al. (2006), the water content in cabbage was 92%, protein 1.6%, fat 0.2%, carbohydrates 4.8%, ash 0.6%, Ca 52 mg\/100g and P 44 mg\/100g. The energy val-ue is 24 kcal\/100 g. Vitamin C which is contained in the cabbage has antioxidant effect, it protects the human body from stress, and it is a cofactor in several vital enzymat-ic reactions (Cauniietal, 2010). According to Gjorgjev et al. (2008), the content of Ca and P in cabbage is in pro-portion that contributes to a better use of these micronu-trients for growth and development of the organism. There are also the following elements: K, Na and Cl, and the trace elements: Cu, Zn, Co and Mn (Lambasa, 2006). Cab-bage contains a significant amount of aromatic substanc-es and organic acids, which give the typical taste and smell (Gjorgjev et al., 2008). Fresh cabbage has healing proper-ties when treating stomach ulcer, protects mucous mem-branes, strengthens the immune system against many dis-eases, increases hemoglobin in the blood and cures anemia, affect the normalization of blood pressure, cures rheuma-tism, reduces the risk of colon hose etc (Vlahovic, 1999).During the drying process on appropriate temperature, free water evaporates which preserves the stability of the product from microbiological and chemical aspect. The content of water in the dried vegetables ranges from 8 to 12%. At the same time, it the concentration of sugars and other ingredients is increased (Katalinic, 2006)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.210365Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.210365Z","inner_id":14,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":15,"annotations":[{"id":15,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":381,"end":392,"text":"antioxidant","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"fNDrcDfQow","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":414,"end":435,"text":"Juniperus communis L.","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"2e_YTywrgI","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":670,"end":681,"text":"antioxidant","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"x23X4OVhnd","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":686,"end":699,"text":"antimicrobial","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"El1f1VFHxw","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":727,"end":762,"text":"Juniperus communis L. var. communis","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"vkyokqIV9t","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":3197,"end":3218,"text":"lipoprotein disorders","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"tKH9Kg0wn6","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7766,"end":7781,"text":"hyperlipid-emia","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"b3Hg4X_Pat","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7809,"end":7822,"text":"heart disease","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"mNby9ZdpSP","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7873,"end":7887,"text":"hyperlipidemia","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"vMTB1uk77F","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":7909,"end":7937,"text":"Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"igRN8BzwH4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":9975,"end":9989,"text":"kidney disease","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"yKHTizdrR4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":9994,"end":10008,"text":"renal problems","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"Du46PEQW9t","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":10915,"end":10926,"text":"dehydration","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"EuOnp19311","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":10930,"end":10942,"text":"malnutrition","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"WMkPhcr4oc","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":10946,"end":10960,"text":"kidney failure","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"XVmNQzV_WS","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":960,"end":1012,"text":"Juniperus oxycedrus L. subsp. macrocarpa (Sm.)

A. Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, Macedonia* bsimonovska@gmail.comIntroductionMany analytes of interest in the clinical laboratory can vary over an individual's lifetime, simply because of natural biological factors involved in the aging process. These variations may occur rapidly at critical points in the life cycle, such as during the neonatal period, childhood, puberty, menopause, or old age. Biological variation has an important effect on the interpretation of all laboratory investigations, including triglycerides and cholesterol (Fraser, 2001).Biological variation, i.e., the normal day-to-day variation of cholesterol is within the range of 3-5%. Many studies have also documented a seasonal variation. Although there is a discordance between the studies, cholesterol levels tend to be higher in winter and lower during the summer months independent of the country of origin, ethnicity, age, sex, and baseline lipids. The seasonal variation has been reported to be as high as 12% (Deeg, 2006). Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in humans and animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transfer of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils.Cholesterol is a sterol (or modified steroid), a lipid molecule that is biosynthesized by all animal cells because it is an essential structural component of all cell membranes required to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. It enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall to protect membrane integrity and cell viability.Cholesterol and triglycerides, like many other essential components of the body, attract clinical attention when present in abnormal concentrations. For the diagnosis of different lipoprotein disorders, one can usually rely on simple plasma values of total cholesterol and triglycerides. Obtained lipid values will be interpreted in relation to age and gender according to reference values (Mula-Abed et al, 2008). MethodsAnalysis of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides is usually performed on blood specimens collected by the standard procedure. Fasting venous blood was collected at 8-10 am following an overnight fast, from apparently healthy participants (men and women, aged 15-67 years). The specimens were collected in 1-year period. Serum TG and total cholesterol were measured by enzymatic methods using kits from Biosystems (Spain) and biochemistry analyzer Mindray BS-200. Cholesterol was assayed by the cholesterol esterase\/cholesterol oxidase\/4-aminophenazone\/phenol method and the triglycerides by glycerol phosphate oxidase\/peroxidase method (Biosystems, 2012)Standard statistical methods were used or the analysis of data. The mean and SD were calculated for each parameter of serum triglycerides and cholesterol from each participant. The data was inspected for any outlier (defined as values outside +- 3 SD from the mean). There was no outlier and all results were within the mean value +- 2 SD. ResultsThe study was conducted with cholesterol samples from 210 apparently healthy participants with mean of 5.22+-1.85 (Coefficient of variation (CV) 17.73%) and triglycerides samples from 204 participants with mean of 1.56+-1.54 (CV 49.46%). These results were divided for observation in groups by age and gender. S3 PP 152324Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 323 - 324 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionPoster presentationsThere are 10 groups with number of participants: Group 1: 15-29 years male, Group 2: 15-29 years female, Group 3: 30-39 years male, Group 4: 30-39 years female, Group 5: 40-49 years male, Group 6: 40-49 years female, Group 7: 50-59 years male, Group 8: 50-59 years female, Group 9: 60+ years male and Group 10: 60+ years female. From these groups 5 groups were made for observation by gender. The obtained results from the participants were compared with the reference values provided by the used kits manufacturer (Biosystems, 2012).The results from cholesterol measurements follows:Group 1, N=26, x=5.11+-1.76 (CV 17.19%); Group 2, N=21, x=4.87+-1.6 (CV 16.46%); Group 3, N=23, x=5.37+-1.84 (CV 17.2%); Group 4, N=21, x=5.00+-1.76 (CV 17.67%); Group 5, N=20, x=5.58+-1.92 (CV 17.24%); Group 6, N=20, x=5.25+-1.06 (CV 20.19%); Group 7, N=21, x=5.27+-2.16 (CV 20.5%); Group 8, N=20, x=5.57+-1.12 (CV 10.1%); Group 9, N=21, x=5.15+-2.22 (CV 21.53%); Group 10, N=17, x=4.99+-1.5 (CV 14.97%).The results from triglycerides measurements follows:Group 1, N=24, x=1.57+-1,7 (CV 54.12%); Group 2, N=22, x=1.16+-1.0 (CV 43.37%); Group 3, N=22, x=1.94+-1.06 (CV 27.53%); Group 4, N=21, x=1.20+-1.7 (CV 70.71%); Group 5, N=17, x=1.96+-1.58 (CV 40.64%); Group 6, N=18, x=1.40+-1.8 (CV 64.65%); Group 7, N=20, x=1.72+-1.86 (CV 54.13%); Group 8, N=21, x=1.73+-1.26 (CV 36.36%); Group 9, N=20, x=1.33+-1.08 (CV 40.38%); Group 10, N=19, x=1.66+-1.48 (CV 44.39%).DiscussionBiological variation has an important effect on the in-terpretation of different laboratory investigations, includ-ing triglycerides and cholesterol. There is also a growing interest in evaluating the cut-off limits for the desirable thresholds of serum cholesterol and triglycerides accord-ing to different recommendations and clinical trials, with a trend is towards lowering these limits.The inter-individual variations for cholesterol are 17.73% and for triglycerides are 49.46%. The study by Ford (1989) had reported an inter-individual variation 17.3% for cholesterol, which is in agreement with the val-ues observed in our study. The range of variability in serum lipid profile between individuals in this study for cholester-ol is 4.3-6.14 mmol\/L, but according to the kit documenta-tion cholesterol level should be lower than 5.2 mmol\/L and for triglycerides this range is between 0.79-2.33 mmol\/L (lower than 1.7 mmol\/L declared in the kit documentation).ConclusionFrom the data for cholesterol, with the usage of t-test, we can conclude that there are no significant differences in the results between different age groups and gender, but there is a significance in results for triglycerides (p<0,05) between participants with age of 15-49 in both male and female groups. The study should be widened with imple-menting analytical variation and intra-individual data.Extensive medical research has identified hyperlipid-emia as a major risk factor for heart disease with an estab-lished clinical correlation between hyperlipidemia and the incidence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). The impor-tance of this study is detection of sudden changes in lipid values that may indicate a change in diet, medications, or onset of a new disease state.ReferencesBiosystems, S.A., 2012.

Also gender in various analytes can play an important role. In our study we made a comparison between different age groups, gender and reference range for creatinine and urea in serum (Cvitkovic and Mesic,1999).Creatinine is a chemical waste molecule that is produced when muscles use creatine, another naturally occurring product in the body, to create energy. About 2% of creatine is converted to creatinine each day. Most of the waste creatinine is expelled from the body in the urine (Hosten, 1990). The creatinine level measured for an individual should be relatively constant over time and should be within a \"normal\" range. The creatinine level is one of the main indicators of kidney function. If the creatinine level is elevated, the patient should be further evaluated for other signs of kidney disease and renal problems. Normal creatinine level ranges will depend on age, gender and other health factors (Taylor, 1989).Blood urea nitrogen, known by the simple initials BUN is the measurement of urea nitrogen levels in the blood. Urea nitrogen is naturally produced by the liver as a waste product of digested protein. After production, urea is transported to the kidneys where it is excreted from the blood stream. The BUN test is therefore conducted to determine how much urea nitrogen is still present in the blood, and this test mainly determines if the kidneys renal functions are working as they should. There are many factors that could bring about high or low levels of BUN.BUN and creatinine tests are often used together to determine the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine. The BUN to creatinine ratio ultimately helps the physician to find the cause of the poor kidney function and the causes may vary from dehydration to malnutrition or kidney failure.MethodsAnalysis of serum creatinine and urea was performed on blood specimens collected by the standard procedure. Fasting venous blood was collected at 8-10 am following an overnight fast, from apparently healthy participants (men and women, aged 15-65 years). The specimens were collected in a period of one year. Serum creatinine and urea were measured by enzymatic methods using kits and from Biosystems (Spain) and the biochemistry analyzer Mindray BS-200. Creatinine was assayed by picrate in alkaline medium forming colored complex, Jaffe method (Fabiny and Ertingshausen, 1971) and urea by urease\/glutamate dehydrogenase method (Gutmann and Bergmeyer, 1974).Standard statistical methods were used or the analysis of data. The mean and SD were calculated for each parameter of serum creatinine and urea from each participant. The data were inspected for any outlier (defined as values outside +- 3 SD from the mean). There was no outlier and all results were within the mean +- 2 SD.ResultsThe study was conducted with creatinine samples from 220 apparently healthy participants with mean value of 74.19+-23.22 (coefficient of variation (CV) 15.64%) and urea samples from 217 participants with mean of 4,88+-1,31 (CV 26,94%). These samples results were divided for observation in groups by age and gender.

(Proleterska), 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* nbitoljanu@gmail.comIntroductionAccording to World Health Organization, the suicide death rate per population of 100000 in the Republic of Macedonia is 5.42 suicides (WHO, 2014). The most com-mon suicide methods in our country are hanging, intoxica-tion with corrosive substances and gunshot wounds. Rarest way of suicide is intoxication with drugs especially with barbiturates. We have only two cases of intoxication with barbiturates in the last five years. Materials and methodsCase hystory: Female, twenty-five years was found dead lying on the bed in a hotel room, where she stayed. During the external examination of the body on the crime scene we found complete development of rigor mortis. On the bedside table, were found a box of Diazepam, gel tube of Lidocaine, a plastic bag with white powder contents and two suicide letters (one designated for the mother, and one for the police). The suicide letters for the police contained the whole process of the suicide, with mentioning of the drug types used. In the letter was described Pentobarbital used because causes coma and respiratory depression, Li-docaine used for decrease the unpleasant bitter taste and Metoclopramide used to prevent vomiting. Postmortem blood and urine samples were collected for toxicological investigation. Toxicological qualitative analysis of blood using gas chromatography mass spec-trometry (GC-MS) was performed. Determination of eth-anol was performed using headspace gas chromatography. Quantification of urine samples was performed with fluo-rescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA, AxSym system analyser- Abbott, USA). ResultsAutopsy findingsPostmortem lividity was developed, distributed on the dorsal portion of the body and disappeared on blunt pres-sure. Medico-legal autopsy revealed no external changes. No findings of natural disease were observed. During the internal examination, we observed non-specific signs of asphyxia. The brain was slightly oedematous. The lungs were congested and oedematous, with subserous petechi-al hemorrhages.Toxicology findings GC-MS toxicological analysis confirmed the presence of Pentobarbital, Diazepam, Lidocain-M-(desethyl) and Metoclopramide. No ethanol was detected in the samples. FPIA results from the urine samples indicated a level of pen-tobarbital (more than 2000 ng\/ml) and 498 ng\/ml of diaze-pam. According to urine cut-off levels for reporting posi-tive blood level or limit of quantitation (CLR,2016), both urine pentobarbital and diazepam are over the cut off. No other drugs were found in the blood and urine of the victim.PsychoautopsyThe suicide letter to her mother contained the reason of the suicide explaining the lack of reason and motivation for life and fatigue, mentioning unsuccessful treatment at S3 PP 150320Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 319 - 320 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionPoster presentationsphysiatrist. In the letter to her mother she stated that she was tired from being depressed all the time and that she had had nothing to live for, because she had no intention to work, get married or have a child. She had one previ-ous suicide attempt with barbiturates and benzodiazepines. Discussion Suicide is an act or an instance of taking one's own life voluntarily and intentionally. Suicide is a behavior that dif-fers from one person to another and from one time to an-other and has different motivations and anticipated gains. There are differences in the suicide method used in dif-ferent countries. Three methods - hanging, pesticide poi-soning and firearm are dominated. Jumping from a height and other methods of poisoning (i.e. mainly poisoning by drugs) occasionally appears as important alternative meth-ods. The suicide method with poisoning is more popular in women than in men. In general, underlying suicide pat-terns tell us more about the availability and acceptability of suicide methods than about other disparities (Ajdacic-Gross et al., 2008). Factors that affect the risk of suicide include genetic vulnerability and psychiatric, psychologi-cal, familial, social, and cultural factors. The effects of me-dia are also important; the spread of information about sui-cide methods affects the choices that people make when at-tempting to kill themselves. In this case during forensics analyses and psychoautopsy of the suicide letters we con-cluded depressed mood, lack of interest in pleasure, fillings of worthlessness, guilt, suicide statements and attempts all point out to major depressive disorder. Detailed description of suicide, the information of drug effects used direct on preparation process and internet investigation, which sug-gest awareness of the consequences.The suicide letter mentioned alleged ingestion of Pen-tobarbital, Diazepam, Lidocaine and Reglan. The toxicol-ogy department of our institute confirmed the presence of these compounds in the blood and urine of the victim. Pen-tobarbital is a short-acting barbiturate that acts like a non-selective central nervous system depressant, and is primar-ily used as sedative hypnotic, as an anticonvulsant in sub hypnotic doses, medically induced coma and euthanasia in veterinary medicine (Charney et al., 2006; Greenblatt et al., 1979). In cases of intoxications, suppression of the cen-tral nervous system, hypotension, hypothermia, coordina-tion disorders, respiratory failure and coma are the major clinical symptoms (Fell et al., 1968). Diazepam is a de-rivative of benzodiazepine that is widely prescribed as an antianxiety agent. Diazepam is sometimes used with other medications to treat seizures. When barbiturates are com-bined with other central nervous system (CNS) depres-sants, such as alcohol, opiates, or benzodiazepines, over-dose is even more dangerous due to additive depressant effects on the CNS and respiratory system (Mactier et al., 2014). The clinical effects of barbiturates and benzo-diazepines are similar and result as sequelae to hyperpo-larizing the neuron, there are subtle differences in terms of receptor binding. Barbiturates increase the duration of Cl ion channel opening at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, which, in turn, increases the efficacy of GABA. Benzodiazepines, on the other hand, increase the frequency of Cl ion channel openings at the GABA recep-tor, which, in turn, increases the potency of GABA (Shar-ma and Hoffman, 2011). ConclusionSuicides with intoxication with these types of drugs are rare because of the unavailability of drugs, because they are prescription drugs, or are intended for clinical practice only. This case, suggest on detailed planned and determination to end her life. The combination of Pentobarbital, Diazepam, antiemetic drugs and the content of the suicide letter stat-ing when, and how she will die, suggest that the victim was familiar with drug effects and knew where to get them. We should point that among all classical forensic methods, we include psychoautopsy as a good method which helps us to finalize all investigation and make scientific based conclu-sions for motivation and way of taking her own life.

Cyril and Methodius University,Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* leonardkurti@hotmail.comIntroductionFor centuries, juniper berries and leaves extracts and their essential oils have been used in the folk medicine due to their therapeutic properties, such as antimicrobial, an-ti-inflammatory, diuretic, hypoglycemic, hypotensive and analgesic effect. Due to the exclusive aroma, juniper cones are utilized in the food industry as a spice and in the pro-duction of alcoholic beverages as flavor. Today, there is an increased interest in the identification of natural and safe sources of antioxidants, in order to replace synthetic anti-oxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylat-ed hydroxytoluene (BHT) and tertiary-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) which have a limited use due to their toxicity and carcinogenicity.The purpose of this study is to determine total phenols, total flavonoids and the antioxidant activity of ethanol ex-tracts from berries of Juniperus excelsa, Juniperus commu-nis and Juniperus foetidissima from different localities of the R. of Macedonia.Materials and methodsThe plant samples were collected in late autumn in 2011 and 2012. The berries (4 samples) of J. communis (JC) were collected from Skopje (sk), Velestovo (ve), Kice-vo (ki), and Resen (re), the berries (2 samples) of J. excel-sa (JE) from Dojran (do) and Velestovo (ve) and the berries (2 samples) of J. foetidissima from Valandovo (va) and Ve-lestovo (ve). Botanical identification was made at the Insti-tute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy - Skopje. The plant material was properly dried, stored in paper bags and kept in dark and cool place until testing.The plant material (0.5 g) was milled to a fine powder and extracted with 70% ethanol. The extraction procedure for sample preparation was performed with 10 mL of 70% ethanol for 30 min in the ultrasonic bath. After filtration of the extracts, the volume was adjusted to 10 mL. Estimation of the total phenolic content (TPC) was done using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent according to the Sin-gleton's method with minor modifications.The total flavonoid content (TFC) was estimated using the aluminium chloride colorimetric method described by Talari (Talari, 2012).The antioxidant activity was determined using three methods: DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) method, FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) method and H2O2 (Hydrogen peroxide) method.The ability of the tested extracts to reduce the DPPH radical was determined from the color bleaching of the purple ethanol solution of DPPH. The antioxidant activi-ty of the extracts is expressed as IC50 (mg\/mL), indicating the concentration that is required to cause 50% reduction of the DPPH radical. The FRAP activity of the extracts was determined according to the procedure described by Oyai-zu. The scavenging capacity of the extracts for hydrogen peroxide was determined according to the method of Ruch with minor modifications. S3 PP 151322Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 321 - 322 (2016)Clinical biochemistry \/ Toxicology \/ Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe content of total phenolic compounds in all in-vestigated samples vary from 41.32+-0.20 mg GAE\/g dw to 96.83+-0.41mg GAE\/g dw in the samples JF(va) and JE(ve), respectively. The total flavonoid content in the plant samples was in the range from 14.03+-1.20 mg QE\/g dw to 34.01+-3.87 mg QE\/g dw in the samples of JF(va) and JC(ki), respectively.All the extracts showed antioxidant activity using the DPPH method. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the samples increased with an increase in extract concen-tration. The ability of the corresponding extract for reduc-tion of DPPH free radicals expressed as IC50 values was obtained in the range from 0.006 mg\/mL for the sample JF(ve) to 0.713 mg\/mL for the sample JC(ki). The obtained reducing ability against DPPH radical was compared to the IC50 values for Quercetin and BHA (1.0 ug\/mL and 6.0 ug\/mL, respectively). All tested samples manifested good scavenging potential for H2O2. The lowest inhibitory activ-ity against H2O2 was found in JE(do):17.68%, 16.29% and 15.24% for the extract concentrations 25, 10, and 5 mg\/mL, respectively, while the highest inhibitory activity was found in JF(va): 52.73%; 49.47% and 44.2%, for the corre-sponding extract concentrations.The ferric reducing antioxidant potential was deter-mined by evaluating the capacity of the extract to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Very similar to the DPPH test, the reducing antioxidant potential of every extract showed a positive correlation with their concentrations. The JF(ve) sample showed the strongest reduction of iron 51.08%, 25.19%, and 16.33% for the corresponding concentrations of the extract (0.71; 0.28 and 0.14 mg\/mL), while the weak-est activity is detected in the JC(re) sample with 18.85%, 11.13% and 6.88% for the corresponding extract concen-trations. The activity of extract was compared to the reduc-ing capacity of two standard substances - ascorbic acid and quercetin in concentrations of 0.007 mg\/mL, with 27.71% and 21.37% FRAP capacity, respectively.The berries of the Macedonian wild grown J. commu-nis, J. excelsa and J. foetidissima are a rich source of poly-phenolic compounds. These results are corresponding to those obtained by other authors (Miceli et al., 2009, Elmas-tas M., 2006). Additionally, the obtained values for the an-tioxidant potential of the tested samples are also in accor-dance with the results found in numerous research papers in the field of interest, suggesting that the selected plant samples are a rich source of phenolic and flavonoid com-ponents, and a potential source of antioxidant compounds (Stassi et al., 1998).ConclusionAccording to the obtained results for total phenols, fla-vonoids and the antioxidant potential of the selected plant samples, it may be concluded that the ethanol extracts of berries of J. communis, J. excelsa and J. foetidissima rep-resent potential sources of natural antioxidants. Although a positive correlation was obtained between the total phenol content and the antioxidant activity, further studies are re-quired to clarify which of the components are responsible for the antioxidant properties."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-24T11:13:49.210365Z","updated_at":"2024-05-24T11:27:42.286292Z","inner_id":16,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
