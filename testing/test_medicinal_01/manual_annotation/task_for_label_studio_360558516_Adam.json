Plants such as kawakawa (Piper excelsum), manuka (Leptospermum scoparium), and koromiko (Hebe salicifolia), for example, were among 31 those listed, the last being noted as a treatment for diarrhoea. There was no recognition in these pages of the wider spiritual context of rongoa Maori as a whole system of healing, which is much more complex than herbal medicines alone (Ahuriri-Driscoll, 2014). . The persistence of home remedies into the mid-20th century The home remedies and self-help therapies mentioned in the Colonists' Guide may sound quaint and outdated today, but many of them were still current until at least the early 1970s. My own memories stretch back to my early childhood in the 1950s when pharmacists stocked a wide range of components for making up home remedies. They could be purchased by members of the public in small quantities or made up in the pharmacy on request (Combes, 1981). Home remedies in widespread use at the time included Bonnington's Irish Moss cough mixture, different brands of indigestion tablets, California syrup of figs (a laxative), gripe water for babies, and the patent medicines brought round by the Rawleigh's man.6 Our local chemist made up his 'own brand' range of basic products in brown glass bottles, labelled with his credentials. Diarrhoea and vomiting (sometimes known euphemistically as 'summer sickness') were subject to a range of recommendations for home remedies that were supposed to 'settle the stomach' including grated apple, dry toast, a Rawleigh's product known as Pleasant Relief, flat lemonade, and even ice cream. Basic products and the patent medicines along with aspirin, beef tea, and bed rest were used as supportive care in the days before vaccinations were available for measles7, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. All children were expected to contract them at some stage and my siblings and I were no exception. Non-ingested products such as antiphlogistine for boils, hydrogen peroxide and antiseptic dyes for skin abrasions, thrush and tinea, salt water gargles for sore throats, and camomile lotion for bites and skin rashes were also common. From my own experience, the remedies used were largely limited to treating an illness or skin infection; it was not usual to take a product for prevention apart from patent medicine 'tonics' that were available. Vitamin C tablets appeared in our household for the first time during the mid-1960s as a protection from winter colds and bronchitis, and during the late 1960s large fizzy 6 Rawleighs: a Australasian company that sold patent medicines and cooking essences door to door. It still exists today though the method of sale and the range of products have changed, see https:\/\/www.rawleighs.com\/ 7 The first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 (Bloch et al 1985), with the others following. 32 tablets containing 1000mg doses of Vitamin C became a remedy for hangovers after student parties among some of the young men I knew. Developments in medical care that offered more treatments with prescribed antibiotics, anti- fungals and anti-histamines beginning in the 1940s became more widely available during the 1950s (Gaynes, 2017). In the following couple of decades, the advent of mass production of pre- packaged medicines saw many of the home remedies become outdated or the substances needed to make them no longer readily available. Compounding by community pharmacists was less necessary except in specialised cases, and is now likely to be less than one percent of prescriptions according to Krochmal (2009). Moreover, pharmacists were reluctant to stock ingredients for which there was only minor demand and which had to be discarded before their expiry date (Louise Kennedy pharmacist, personal communication). 'Own brand' basics and ingredients for home remedies were gradually replaced by commercially produced products that could be bought off the shelf or ordered independently in an increasingly globalised market. These were sometimes simply older remedies in a new guise. Garlic, for example, which has been recognised as having medicinal properties since ancient times (Rivlin, 2001), no longer needs to be peeled, crushed and ingested in its raw state but can be bought in a pharmacy or health food store as a prepackaged concentrated and odourless extract known as Kyolic(r) (Balamash et al., 2012). So while the 'natural health' products on pharmacy and health store shelves may appear to be a new phenomenon, they would seem, rather, to be part of a long continuum of obtaining substances to treat illness or maintain health that is connected to the history of humanity from earliest times. The difference is that the physical substances formerly used in home remedies and self-care have been reimagined, repackaged and marketed in a way that resonates with the contemporary citizen and can be obtained over-the-counter in a convenient ready-made form. 33 Chapter 3: Methodology and methods Introduction The key focus of my research was to gain an insight into the perspectives of people who used supplements regularly. I wanted to find out why they first started to take supplements, how they decided what to take, and what kind of effects they reported on their health and wellbeing. I was also interested in their sources of information about supplements, how they chose where to buy them and what their general relationship was with the orthodox health system. In addition I was interested in investigating whether people who used supplements were influenced by social attitudes and discourses that were evident in popular and academic publications and how these related to contemporary and historical ideas and expectations of health, illness and wellbeing throughout the life course. When I started out on the study, I had thought that building a greater understanding of the reasons people chose to use supplements might give a greater insight into the criticism that supplement use attracts in orthodox health care and perhaps go some way to reconciling the disparate views between users and critics. As the study progressed, however, I discovered that it was more important to examine supplement use as a practice in its own right rather than attempting to compare it to or reconcile it with other views. Epistemological approach A fundamental consideration in qualitative research is the ontological and epistemological position of the researcher; that is, their beliefs about what it is possible to find, and how to go about finding it (Giacomini, 2010). The individual researcher's beliefs about the nature of reality shape his or her view of the world; they affect how they approach the topic, how they generate and analyse the data and how they view the topic within the broader social and political context (Giacomini, 2010; Green & Thorogood, 2009). Realist assumptions assume that facts are stable and independent of values, and that researchers can and must distance themselves from the data and take an objective stance (Green & Thorogood, 2009: 13). Constructionists on the other hand, consider that reality is shaped by human processes that influence how the material world is experienced and interpreted and that one person's reality will differ from another's. Extreme constructionists take the view that all reality is relative and depends entirely on how it is constructed by human processes (Green and Thorogood 2009). An individual researcher may sit anywhere along this spectrum from positivist assumptions that reality is fixed at the one end, to 34 extreme constructionist view that nothing has independent reality and everything is relative at the other end. This study started from a constructionist standpoint in which I took the view that while reality exists, human beliefs and attitudes have a major influence on how people perceive and engage with it. Moreover that each individual will construct these influences in different ways and that their beliefs will change over time according to new experiences that they have, and new ideas they come across, as well as their own stage in life (Tulloch & Lupton, 2003). People's constructions of the world are developed as the result of an interaction between their own private, cognitive processes and their exposure to the publicly shared discourses and social norms of the age they live in (Giacomini, 2010). My study aimed to understand more about the phenomenon of supplements and their use by investigating perspectives and subjective experiences of the individual participants by talking to them and so gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding from their point of view (Kelly, 2010; Liamputtong, 2013). As the study progressed, however, it became obvious that the role of the supplement products themselves needed to be included as an important part of the study. This led me to consider a post-humanist element in the overall approach so that these products could be given due consideration. Post-humanism or materialist thinking, encompasses a diverse range of ideas (Bennett, 2010, 2012; Braidotti, 2006; Coole & Frost, 2010; Law, 1999), but they are all consistent in contesting the binary opposition that sees matter as simply inert and passive until humans take an interest in it (MacLure, 2015: 96). This way of thinking disturbs the privileged position of human agency and the primary importance it accords to human \"language, discourse, culture and values\" (Coole & Frost, 2010: 3). It acknowledges that material factors are influential in what happens both in individual lives and more generally within society. Matter is seen as having agency of its own, and that it can be \"...active ... productive, unpredictable\" (Coole & Frost, 2010: 9). Bringing matter back into consideration does not mean excluding the human, but rather restoring materiality to its place and recognising that matter and discourse come together \"...in complex and shifting arrangements from which the world emerges\" (MacLure, 2015:96). To write about both the human and non-human in the context of this study, I have chosen to use the term 'actants'. Actants is a neutral term which simply describes the many and various elements that come together in a phenomenon and avoids the limitations of language that always categorises people and things as being essentially different in their capacities. An actant 35 can be any entity, whether human or non-human, that \"modifies a state of affairs by making a difference\" (Latour, 2005: 71); people, material things, discourses, practices, relationships, or concepts. Using materiality thinking to examine supplements and supplement practices made it possible to incorporate any actants which proved to be important in the study and allowed a greater range of insights than would have been possible by focusing on human discourse alone. Venturing into a post-humanist approach and combining it with the study's original constructionist intention created a number of tensions in bringing these potentially divergent approaches together. Nevertheless there were compelling reason for including both. Much of the data entailed participants' perceptions about what was natural, holistic and safe about supplement practices. I believed that constructionist analysis was the most fitting way to do justice to these data, which had been generated through talking to participants, and was the dominant mode of investigation throughout the study. On the other hand, I considered it equally important not to leave aside the unexpected demonstrations that had occurred during the interviews about the role that the material products played in their lives. This dual approach was a direct result of being confident enough to stay with one of the core strengths of qualitative research, that is, the researcher needs to remain open to being surprised by developments that come to light in the course of their investigation and not set them aside if they do not fit with prior intentions or assumptions (Green & Thorogood, 2009). A number of authors have listed criteria against which qualitative research should be measured, citing characteristics such as validity, reliability and transferability (Pope & Mays, 2006) or credibility, authenticity, dependability and confirmability (Liamputtong, 2013). Lists of desirable qualities, however, tend to raise more questions than they answer. These terms are \"quite loose and imprecise as far as criteria go...and are themselves subject to interpretation...and seem resistant to ever being translated into relatively stable and general standards\" (Smith, 1990: 185- 186). I found that a more helpful approach was Liamputtong's general comment that \"validity lies more in a subjective, human estimation of what it means to have done something well, to have made an effort that is worthy of trust and to have written it up convincingly\" (2013: 43) This was the guidance I attempted to follow in being clear about the evolving process that resulted in moving between a constructionist and a post-humanist approach in different parts of the thesis. 36 Reflexivity One measure of being trustworthy as a researcher working within a constructionist frame is to acknowledge that they do not sit outside the data as an authority who creates categories that interpret and explain the subjects of the research. Rather they need to consider how their own experience, context and broader world view may influence what is found (Green & Thorogood, 2009: 23; Liamputtong, 2013: 29-30; Potvin et al., 2010: 447). They need to reflect critically on the preconceptions and values that they bring to the topic and subject them to the same analysis that they use with the data (Green and Thorogood, 2009). Essentially the researcher needs to acknowledge that a completely objective and value-free stance is not possible, and that their findings from research will inevitably be coloured by their own views and experience. Malterud (2001:484) defines this as \"the knower's mirror: an attitude of attending to the context of knowledge construction, especially to the effect of the researcher, at every step of the research process.\" That means researchers need to examine how their own assumptions and background have influenced their choice of topic, their research methods, and the analyses, interpretations, and writing methods that contribute to the final result (Bourke, 2014; Moser, 2008; Wiederhold, 2015). Rather than this being a disadvantage, explicit acknowledgement of personal and intellectual preconceptions enhances rather than detracts from the credibility of the research findings as the different ways that each researcher approaches the same subject help to generate a more complex understanding of the phenomenon in question (Malterud, 2001). In the following paragraphs, I set out my reflections on my own prior experience and assumptions I brought into the research. As a mature student with a wide range of life experience over more than six decades, I believed that I came to the topic with the advantage of having witnessed many changes in social thinking that had come about over this time. I had lived through major changes in technology and communications, advances in treatment and prevention of health and disease, the globalisation of trade and dissemination of goods, and an increasing diversity of the New Zealand population through immigration. Another important difference from my early years had been the change over the last 60 years from beliefs that nature was there to be used by humans for their purposes and benefit, to the belief that the natural environment must be protected from exploitation and sustained for generations to come. These changes had brought new ideas, discourses, and practices that were widely different from the homogeneous society of my childhood in the 1950s and I believed they had all played some part in contemporary notions of health and illness and had an influence on the use of supplements. 37 On a personal front, I was also well aware that I had led a secure and relatively privileged life compared to many others. I had the advantage of a stable upbringing and had enjoyed access to a wide variety of educational and occupational experiences across a variety of fields. I had studied and worked in the humanities, then in health sciences information, and over the last several decades in public health and primary health care research. I was conscious of the fact that this experience would have inevitably influenced how I thought about supplements and their users, and that I would need to guard against a potential tendency on my part to privilege the accounts of people who were more like me, and perhaps to place less credibility on those reporting attitudes and behaviour in relation to supplement use that was beyond what I would be comfortable with. Yet I was also aware that participants whose views were framed by a different world view from mine (that is, without the same longstanding exposure to the academic and health world), would be the most likely to contribute new and unknown information that would enrich my study. Although I used supplements myself from time to time, particularly to ward off respiratory infections, it was not something I had given much thought to or felt strongly about before the piece of previous research which had aroused my interest. I also believed I had a relatively neutral position towards the orthodox health system, seeing its practitioners as necessary and valuable, particularly in acute care. At the outset of my study, I believed I had no fixed opinion either for or against supplement use and believed I had a good grasp of the main issues. Just how superficial this turned out to be became apparent as I progressed through the study and heard the diverse views of the participants. It was oddly reassuring, however, as it confirmed that the topic I had chosen was worthwhile investigating in depth. The contact with the participants, the settings in which we met, the data itself and the reading and theory I examined opened up a whole new range of ideas about supplements and insights about their place in people's lives and at a more complex level than I had considered previously. Jackson and Mazzei (2012:6) have remarked on the way a researcher's memory of the interviews and their interactions with the participants, their personal and professional knowledge and their \"shifty selves as researchers\", inevitably has an effect on the way they think. This very much reflected what happened to me during the course of the study where my own thinking evolved in unexpected directions as a result of my experiences in conducting the research and becoming immersed in the theory and data. I note in the following chapters the instances where this happened. 38 Methods I chose in-depth interviews as being the most suitable method of generating data for this study as they work well with an inductive approach when new and unknown information is being sought to fill a gap in knowledge about a topic (Pope & Mays, 2006; Rice & Ezzy, 1999). A key advantage of in-depth interviews is that they allow time for the perspective of one individual to be explored in detail, so producing new knowledge through the interaction between the interviewer and interviewee (Kvale 2007 cited in Liamputtong, 2013: 52). They also avoid a participant being interrupted or dominated by the ideas of another person as can sometimes happen in focus groups."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":112,"annotations":[{"id":112,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":13175,"end":13181,"text":"eczema","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_1","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":13216,"end":13231,"text":"Stellaria media","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"entity_2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":18376,"end":18388,"text":"ginko biloba","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"entity_3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":18399,"end":18417,"text":"good for the brain","labels":["Medicinal Effect"]},"id":"7eXwTfs5VH","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"from_id":"entity_2","to_id":"entity_1","type":"relation","direction":"right","labels":["treats_medical_condition"]},{"from_id":"entity_3","to_id":"7eXwTfs5VH","type":"relation","direction":"right","labels":["has_medicinal_effect"]}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.120945Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.120945Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":963.775,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"67abe158-5bcb-4630-9575-774470834326","import_id":3,"last_action":null,"task":2,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f855151c-project-2-at-2024-04-30-16-16-691636e5.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"We do not have to choose between unity and multiplicity ...you see, pure unity or pure multiplicity - when there is only totality or unity and when there is only multiplicity or disassociation - is a synonym of death....A culture is different from itself; language is different from itself; the person is different from itself. Once you take into account this inner and other difference then you pay attention to the other (Derrida, 1997: 13-14). Derrida rejected the criticism of his theory of deconstruction as being a negative concept and emphasised that it was a productive process, that used \"the tension between memory, fidelity, the preservation of something that has been given to us, and at the same time, heterogeneity, something absolutely new, and a break\" (Derrida, 1997: 6). For this study, deconstructing the concepts of naturalness, holistic health and safety from risk meant carefully examining the participants' remarks on these qualities of supplements to see how they unsettled the dominant interpretations about them as being concepts that 'everyone' understood in the same way (Jackson & Mazzei, 2012). It meant being alert to the wide spectrum of views that were expressed in the discussions with the participants, as well as paying attention to the nuances that were implied but less directly stated. It meant noticing that some participants implicitly engaged in their own form of deconstruction, offering both complementary and competing explanations about the qualities of supplements in the course of their remarks. It did not mean undermining or negating what any of them said or treating some remarks as insignificant, but opening up the ideas around the qualities of supplements to show how they were evolving. 53 Using deconstruction within the wider framework of Deleuze and Guattari's rhizomatic assemblage that underpins this study overall allows it to act as a force that diversifies the assemblage of actants. Rather than competing ideas participants put forward about naturalness, for example, being put aside as outliers because they were inconsistent with one another, all interpretations had their place among the heterogeneous components of the assemblage. This diversification resulted in an exponentially greater capacity for connections to be made between the components, which in turn could be seen to be changing the way that the supplement assemblage was spreading out in different directions as it evolved. According to Bearn (2000, 2013), the crucial difference between Derrida and Deleuze is that Derrida sees deconstruction within a framework of success or failure. Opening up to the 'other', according to Derrida (1997: 6), \"this newness, this novelty is a risk ... it is guaranteed by no previous rules.\" Deleuze, in contrast, moves right outside the framework of winning or losing in the 'game of existence' and \"the point of the game floats away, leaving us just playing\" (Bearn, 2013: 53-54). Using both Derrida and Deleuze to think about supplements, then, is a way of looking at supplements as ongoing health practices, comprised of multiple components, that are undertaken in the course of individual lives, not focused on any particular end point, and which are always in process, \"in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo\" (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987:26). This approach avoids deciding whether deconstructing the discourses around supplements 'succeeds' or not. Instead, it shows the variety of interpretations around the common discourses about supplements to be unique interconnections that individuals make between the many components in the assemblage, mobilizing them according to what they do in their everyday life, the \"plastic habits ... dynamics and ruptures ... that affect bodily states, modes of attention, and ways of experiencing time and space\" (Dewsbury, 2011: 149, 150). The chapter has three major sections which deconstruct in turn the discourses of naturalness, holistic health, and safety from risk. In each of the three sections I have firstly examined the participants' comments to show the way they unsettled the assumed meaning of each of these qualities and showed up the \"absent present...which has been ignored in an attempt to preserve the illusion of truth as a perfectly self-contained and self-sufficient present\" (Jackson and Mazzei, 2012: 18). I then look at the evolving assemblage of actants that surrounded the idea of supplements as natural, holistic and safe: the products themselves, what the participants said about them, what they said about their own background, relationships, attitudes and experiences of health and life, their reference to discourses in wider society, and their use of information. I show that there were both commonalities and differences in the way the 54 participants thought about the natural, holistic and safe qualities of their supplements, drawing from the past but moving and changing as the participants themselves moved on with their lives, being influenced by new experiences and new social discourses. To conclude, the chapter looks at the three assemblages as part of a greater and even more tangled assemblage where all these connections are intimately linked in shifting arrangements that are always changing, a process which Bearn (2013: 53) terms \"the liquid time of becoming.\" This resonated not only with the study participants as individuals who were striving to pursue a healthy life, but also with the idea of the life quest, where individuals evolve in themselves through the 'becomings' that take place on the journey. Nature and naturalness That supplements and herbal medicines are 'natural' is arguably the most dominant discourse around these products and one which formed a frequent topic in the discussions with the participants. Many of them expressed straightforward views that constructed natural products as being simpler and better for them. I just liked the more natural kind of things rather than getting too carried away with pills and potions. I like them to be a bit more natural. ... I went to a herbalist ... and they would recommend things if I had something wrong ... if you had a sore throat they would recommend this might actually be better for you rather than having something that's got chemicals in it. I guess if I was given the option I would rather something that was natural. (Johnny) Johnny here seems to assume that there is a standard meaning of what is natural and that the two of us who are discussing the issue share an understanding about the positive benefits that it brings to mind. Johnny is not unusual in contemporary times in the way he talks about naturalness, as others have also remarked (Devcich et al., 2007; Li & Chapman, 2012; Rozin et al., 2012; Rozin et al., 2004). Amos et al (2014: 268) suggest that labelling a product as natural evokes \"sentimental pastoral associations\" for consumers that they transfer to the product itself, crediting it with being free of contamination and offering health benefits. All kinds of products - fabrics, foods, construction materials - as well as supplements, draw on naturalness in promoting their benefits to consumers (Childs & Poryzees, 1998; Lahteenmaki, 2013; Rozin et al., 2004). The closer one looks at what is 'natural', however, the more it demonstrates Derrida's notion that there are \"tensions, contradictions, heterogeneity\" (1997: 9) within what appears on the surface to be a single understanding. Deconstructing the 'natural' reveals that it is deeply 55 imbued with complex economic, cultural, social and political currents (Pawson & Brooking, 2013), with many contested meanings, all of which depend to a greater or lesser extent on the contrast between nature and humanity (Kellert, 1993; Rozin et al., 2004; Soper, 1998; Van Koppen, 2000). Nature has never been a neutral, value-free concept (Kearns & Gesler, 1998); it has been associated with sacredness, beauty and peace, as well as fear and destruction. So while nature is beautiful and beneficent it is also terrifying (Kellert, 1993). Awe and worship of the natural environment are considered the most ancient form of religious belief (Shibley, 2011; Snodgrass & Tiedje, 2008). Many modern customs, too, both secular and religious, have their roots in ancient rites associated with natural features such as springs, hills and rocks (Gesler, 1996: 102; Strang, 2004: 111). Yet nature also brings horror and death through cyclones, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires and floods. So in spite of the positive associations that labelling of food products and supplements draws on, for example, nature has many layers of meaning that have differed across historical eras and varied between individuals according to their experience and attitudes to the world (Heintzman, 2009; Lee, 2010; Soper, 1995, 1998). Until relatively recently, mastering, and improving on nature was seen as a universal 'good' for the human race because it increased the chance of survival in an unpredictable world where no one, however wealthy or important, was exempt from sudden death through disease or the vagaries of natural events (Rozin et al., 2004). During the late 19th and first half of the 20th century, however, major advances in engineering, science and food safety saw these fears moderate as life became less uncertain (Stanziani, 2008). Longevity improved and confidence increased in \"Western models of progress\" (Soper, 1998: 5) which would improve on the natural world through science and technology. By the second half of the 20th century, however, it became clear that conquering nature was not an unalloyed good and that human disregard for the importance of the natural eco-system had created a range of disastrous consequences (Beck, 2000; Chapman et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2016; Meffe, 1992). Environmental and human disasters such as the dust bowl in the US in the 1930s (Romm, 2011), the Bhopal chemical explosion (Varma & Varma, 2005), and the nuclear accident at Chernobyl (Bouville et al., 2005; Moller & Mousseau, 2006) to name just a few, saw a realisation that exploiting and damaging the natural environment would ultimately rebound on humanity. More recently, the series of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2019), and the linking of extreme weather events to human-induced climate change rather than to exclusively natural causes (Mann et al., 2017; Stott et al., 2016), have added even more 56 compellingly to the acknowledgement that the natural environment needs to be respected and cared for and that damage done will eventually have to be addressed. There has been a widespread societal change in attitudes to environmental protection, encompassing several strands of interwoven ideas. Firstly, that natural resources need to be preserved for sustainable use for future generations (Hansen et al., 2013; Holden et al., 2014); secondly, that human health and global environmental health are intimately linked (Rabinowitz & Conti, 2013; Stephenson et al., 2013) and thirdly, that the natural environment and non-human species have an intrinsic value that humans have a moral responsibility to preserve (Batavia & Nelson, 2017; Chan et al., 2016; Piccolo, 2017). These dominant, though not uncontested, social discourses appear to underpin the attitude to nature and natural things as pure, simple and superior to the non-natural (Amos, 2014; Li & Chapman, 2012; Rozin et al., 2012). One particular way that preference for natural things manifests itself is in relation to substances that are ingested as food, drink and medicines (Aprile et al., 2016; Li & Chapman, 2012; Saher et al., 2006; Thompson, 2003). Johnny, in the excerpt above, demonstrates this attitude in his comments, yet he also implicitly acknowledges that there are gradations within naturalness. He does not explain, for example, what he means by 'a bit more natural' and he constructs the herbalist's products as different from 'pills and potions' because they do not have 'chemicals' even though he may well take them, too, in the form of pills or potions. Many participants also seemed to see it as self-evident that 'natural products' and pharmaceuticals were on separate sides of a divide in medicinal products and had their own idea of where the boundary between them should be drawn. Prescribed medicines, constructed as 'drugs' were on the other side of that boundary for most of them and not thought of as natural products: Certainly with the things I use for my family, I think I'm doing the right thing. It's quite empowering in a way. Because it's shown to be natural you feel like you're doing something - you're not pumping drugs into your body. (Vonnie) It is noticeable that Vonnie's use of the expression 'pumping drugs' calls to mind syringes and hospitals, which emphasise the sharp contrast she is making between the two constructs; one draws on the idea of treating oneself with a simple product from nature, while the other draws on concepts of interventionist medicine over which the individual has limited control. Olivia 57 brought this out even more directly in her account of treating her child's eczema with a paste made from chickweed (Stellaria media) from her own garden: In a couple of days it had gone. You know, nothing else - we were trying all those remedies - we had gone to get those lipid creams, steroid stuff and then it would go and then come back. With this, a few days - a week and it was gone until maybe the next season and we would try it again. We did that a few seasons and it never came back again. (Olivia) Olivia makes her point by pointing to the clear contrast between the (natural) home-made herbal remedy and the (non-natural) 'steroid stuff' of the prescribed medicines. Yet a large number of prescription drugs are either directly plant-based or a chemically modified version of compounds from plants, so that the difference between a natural health product and a pharmaceutical medicine can be very small (Holt & MacDonald, 2008: 22-23). A number of participants, however, without any prompting, commented on the indeterminate line between what was natural and what was not. I did not specifically ask them to articulate what they meant by 'natural' but it is possible that participating in the study led them to think more critically about their practices than before. Whether or not this was the case, they engaged in their own form of deconstruction, reflecting on the competing meanings that existed, including in their own practices. How natural is 'natural'? Participants' comments ranged from the sceptical to the pragmatic and the (relatively) idealistic. Some of them acknowledged that thinking of supplements as natural required a certain amount of willing suspension of disbelief, an awareness that the 'natural' label on a product was not something that stood up to investigation and could simply be a marketing tool. Iris, for example, indicated that she chose not to think too deeply about the substances she took which were \"meant to be all natural but it's in a powder so you have to wonder how natural that is\". Bryony shared Iris's scepticism about the products available for sale. She noted that though she bought so-called 'natural medicines' for herself and her family, they were usually powdered extracts in capsules bought from a shop, and quite possibly made in a factory by the same company that made pharmaceuticals: Just because it is on a shelf and is labelled as natural doesn't mean it doesn't have an effect on your whole body balance. ...natural to me would be if I went and picked 58 something and I could see all the bits of dried leaves and twigs and dried berries and made some kind of something out of it and drink it. To me that's natural. (Bryony) However, she acknowledged that this artisan ideal was unrealistic for her and most others, as they would have neither the ingredients nor the desire to formulate their own products. Her compromise was to get products that were \"just as close to natural as I can get in the form of medicine that you get from a health food store or from a pharmacy.\" As Bryony indicates here, if the original substances are going to be sold in shops, they need to be packaged into a stable format that can be shipped to different destinations and still retain their active properties, but in doing so they lose their completely 'natural' qualities. Almost all participants relied on commercially sold products and even for those few who made some of their own, it was only as a complement to other products that they bought. The standardisation needed to produce and market herbal medicines on a large scale so that they are consistently the same quality is another contested area which unsettles the idea of 'true' naturalness. The commercial marketing of supplements has been seen as distancing herbal traditions from their craft-based origins in order to turn them into a globalised industry. Some have interpreted standardisation as being politically and economically motivated by \"seemingly inevitable biomedical hegemony\" (Singer & Fisher, 2007: 25) that wants to force traditional healing modalities to \"play the evidence game\" (Barry, 2006: 2650) and be brought within the \"structurally dominant scientific paradigm\" (Jagtenberg & Evans, 2003: 321). The contrasting view is that 'natural' (that is, alternative) and orthodox medical approaches have much to offer each other and that they can and should work together for mutual benefit. Wahlberg (2008) for example, supports the standardisation of plant extracts as being an avenue through which they may be accepted as potential treatments available either within orthodox medicine or as an additional support to what has been prescribed. One of the pharmacist participants voiced a similar view; his experience was that an integrated approach provided a greater range of options and ultimately benefited his customers: [the customer] would come with a prescription and say, well I don't know about this but anyway I was sort of thinking about another alternative, what is there? And so you would still support the doctor who prescribed it but on the other hand you could say, well there are other options, maybe as a helper for what you have been given ...So in a sense it helps that person. Or they will come in and say I've heard that ginko biloba is really good for the brain, what do you think about that? (Lou) 59 Participants generally seemed to agree in principle with this practical, open approach."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":113,"annotations":[{"id":113,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.120945Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.120945Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":677.334,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"1274e711-6225-45d1-b30b-df5c7484c8d9","import_id":4,"last_action":null,"task":3,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f855151c-project-2-at-2024-04-30-16-16-691636e5.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"They drew from the assemblage of the natural whatever fitted with their own concept and they felt was appropriate in a particular situation. Although some of their comments indicated that they saw natural products and prescribed medicines as ideologically separate categories, they generally seemed to take the view that having access to all kinds or products in both categories gave them greater choice. Even those, like Vonnie, who made the comment about \"pumping drugs into your body\", were not averse to using prescribed medicines if they believed them appropriate to particular circumstances. They appeared to see this as practical and realistic rather than being concerned that it was inconsistent with their views on naturalness. Some did, however, comment on how disappointing it was that their doctors did not seem to have an equally open and flexible attitude to suggesting natural products as an option: I feel I have had some really good doctors through the years, I just don't feel that they ever even give the option for the natural way forward. It's usually, here's your whatever medication it is. (Penny) Another participant, Paul, drew attention to the way perceptions of a product could be manipulated by a simple labelling change; privileging a popular or botanical name of a herbal product would point out its simplicity and naturalness, but the chemical name component could be used in other circumstances to create a different impression: ...because of having chemical names for everything, people are actually looking for it to be simpler than that. The ones in our shampoo are extracted from the palm tree. The neem tree. And the active ingredient in it has got a chemical name - Azarydin [Azadirachtin]. So, people say, are they chemical free? But in actual fact they have got chemicals in them because everything has a chemical symbol of some sort. (Paul) Other examples of constructing products using different discourses that frame them as either 'natural' or a 'chemical' product are also easy to find. The wholesome sound of 'pure spring water' or 'naturally fermented cider vinegar' on labels, for example, creates quite a different perception than if the same products are described as H2O or E260 on another (Beebee & Sabbarton-Leary, 2010; Plessi, 2003). Naturalness is clearly not the \"perfectly self-contained and self-sufficient\" truth (Jackson and Mazzei, 2012: 18) that it may appear to be on the surface. The 'naturalness' of supplement products can easily be deconstructed to show the multiplicity of understandings and perceptions about them that unsettle the idea of a dualistic division between them and prescribed 60 medicines. While some participants appeared to accept their naturalness as being obvious and simple, they also seemed well aware that labelling something as 'natural' did not necessarily make it so. Others were self-reflexive, presenting thoughtful insights about the inconsistencies in what they said and what they actually did in their practices with supplements. The participants' comments reflected the tension and multiplicity that Derrida spoke about that keep ideas alive and make them productive instead of closing them in on themselves. 'Natural', it seemed, was a flexible enough descriptor to retain its overall salience as a concept but one that could be interpreted from a variety of perspectives and fit a variety of circumstances. As other writers have also noted, while everyday understandings about the natural are imprecise and can easily be deconstructed, it is a mistake to overlook the sentiments that they give rise to; the concept of naturalness has a broad and enduring appeal across cultural and philosophical differences, values and self-image (Johar & Siergy, 1991; Soper, 1998: 181). Importantly, ideas about what was natural were in process of change. It was clear from talking to the participants that their practices and the particular substances they thought of as natural were becoming even more nuanced as they continued to evolve. New products, new circumstances and experiences continued to arise, and new discourses and information continued to come to hand which fitted in one way or another with various individuals' view of what naturalness consisted of. Some of these changing aspects of the natural assemblage were highlighted by the participants, and are discussed below. The evolving assemblage of the natural: traditional, exotic, novel, ethical Many of the participants looked back to the past, referring to practices that had been used by their parents and grandparents when they spoke about their preference for natural products. They frequently drew on childhood memories, recalling simple home remedies that had been used at the time. They gave accounts of family illnesses being treated successfully with a minimum of fuss. There was a strong element of nostalgia in the way participants recalled these traditional practices using products that were readily to hand: My mother was a country girl, and my grandmother. In those days they were isolated, I suppose. There was always lemon honey for a sore throat, those sort of things. Baking soda for bites, vinegar for stings ... (Frances) Comments like this evoked an idyllic and comfortable past \"... as it should have been\" (Thomson, 2008: 4-5), when simple remedies sourced from home kitchens sufficed to soothe all ailments. 61 But as the epigram rather cleverly puts it, \"Nostalgia is like grammar: the present is tense but the past is perfect\" (Lowenthal, 2015).9 Common cultural narratives which draw on memories of a better, simpler past from which unpleasantness has been brushed away are a known phenomenon (Horton, 2008; Taylor, 2000). The (re)construction of childhood as being a utopian time, a golden age that has been displaced by modernity, according to Soper (1988: 188) is not just a contemporary phenomenon but can be found as far back as the beginning of recorded history. Many of the participants' reminiscences drew on this sort of familiar narrative. Interestingly, no matter whether their childhood years were quite recent or many decades behind them, participants of all ages spoke of their childhood as a time when household remedies had been used at home for family illnesses and \"you didn't just pop down to the doctor for anything\" (Johnny). They indicated that they were simply continuing this tradition by being self-reliant and using the knowledge that they had been brought up with. They framed their practices learned from their earlier years as 'natural' but it was clear that, even if they did not recognise it, both the participants and their 'natural' practices had changed and evolved considerably over time. Two of the Maori participants illustrated precisely how their traditions had drawn from the past but evolved over time, and for each of them in a different way. Caro had grown up in a farming family where rongoa (Maori traditional healing) was in everyday use. She explained that her grandmother was a skilled practitioner and her treatments worked \"for us in the old days\" but since then, attitudes and practices had changed: In my Nanny's days, there was always karakia [prayer], there was always a big process. It wasn't just about making rongoa and selling it and using it. There was all this pre- stuff, you stuff. ... See, at the Matatini [the national festival of Maori culture], and I'm not bagging them, but they had a tent with people in there doing massage and things and they had things in bottles. In my day, they didn't have that. You became unwell, Nanny went into the bush or wherever, got stuff, made stuff, and did the karakia, and did all the things before she applied or you took the stuff. It wasn't about going somewhere and buying stuff and taking it. That's where the difference is. (Caro) 9 Lowenthal (2015) cites this epigram and indicates in a footnote that this remark is of doubtful origin and is \"attributed to radio historian Owens Lee Pomeroy or speechwriter Robert Orben.\" I have not been able to find any further source for this. 62 Caro was now a grandmother herself, and while she clearly regretted that the old ways were disappearing, she acknowledged that the social context had changed and the practices could not remain static, but had to adapt. The positive aspect, she went on to remark, was that interest in traditional Maori medicine was growing and being opened up to a much wider range of people. She wished that she knew enough to \"educate people correctly\", but noted that keeping strictly to the old traditions would not be an option for most people as the necessary natural substances were hard to find in urban environments. Another participant, Marama and her family, had a different way of adapting the older ways they knew. They had prioritised retaining one traditional practice they considered important to carry out in the original way they had learned. She and her husband had first-hand knowledge from elders in their family for brewing infusions from the leaves of the kawakawa tree (Piper excelsum). They went on family expeditions to rural areas to gather the leaves themselves, recited the traditional karakia (prayers) that had come down to them from older generations, and kept special utensils for brewing and processing the leaves into a liquid. In keeping with changing times, however, they kept the infusion in the fridge and mixed it with orange juice for their children to drink. Many of the other participants who recounted home health care practices from their past could also be seen to have adapted them as time passed and the context changed. They might still fall back on old home remedies like lemon and honey drinks, but equally they had added new and different options that were readily available. Glucosamine and magnesium, for example, which are clearly not kitchen cupboard essentials, were the most frequently mentioned products in the study, with many participants taking one or the other (or both) regularly. The evolution of health practices in just this way appears to be inevitable and is not necessarily something to be regretted. Moreover, it also happens in less developed countries where people's use of traditional practices is common but changes over time and when new circumstances arise. An example reported in a study of traditional health practices in Tanzania (Bignante & Tecco, 2013) showed that although some aspects of traditional medicines had been lost, people now had access to a wider range of health care options: herbal remedies and traditional healers, as well as doctors and allopathic medicines, all of which they found valuable. Somewhat paradoxically, the interest in home-made traditional medicines has given rise also to a surge of interest in the traditional medicines of distant societies that are made from substances little known to Western consumers (Connell, 2006; May, 1996). This fascination has been attributed to a type of nostalgia, not for a personal past, but for a utopian 'ideal' and a way of getting in touch with a simpler and more natural way of life that has retained what has been 63 lost by those living in contemporary Western society (Holbrook & Schindler, 2003; Pickering & Keightley, 2006). While this is clearly an oversimplification of the complexities involved (see Snodgrass & Tiedje, 2008), part of the appeal of unfamiliar substances seems to be in their exoticism, their 'otherness' and novelty \"rather than any particular efficacy or medical merit\" (Bivins, 2007: 12). There also appears to be an element of the mythologisation of indigenous cultures as exemplifying an authentic and uncorrupted way of living harmoniously with nature, a phenomenon that Davidov describes as: burgeoning worldwide, creating instances of performed culture through a web of commodification connecting the indigenous producers, brokering their own culture with Western consumers that come in search of their fantasies (2012: 482). Two examples of these 'new' products sought by Western consumers are powdered maca root (Lepidium meyerii) from the Peruvian Andes (Gonzales 2012), and Garcinia cambogia (Nayak et al 2010), a fruit from Indonesia. The medicinal uses of maca and garcinia have been well known for centuries in their places of origin but have only recently entered the 'natural health' range in health stores and pharmacies. Loyer and Knight (2018) in their case study of maca, show that the discourses around this so-called 'Inca superfood' draw on an idealised framing of the people of the Andes as living in a nutritional utopia where plants are grown using traditional and timeless methods, presenting it in contrast to the industrialisation of the developed countries where it has suddenly become popular. Certainly, products containing maca or garcinia were heavily promoted in the print publications that I collected during the course of this study, often with reference to their exotic origins. So while the assemblage of the natural includes discourses of simplicity, homeliness, and memories of the past, it may also evolve to encompass those products which are unfamiliar but seem appealing both because of their exoticism in the individual's particular context and the idea they convey of a more 'natural' way of life. Pickering et al (2006) have argued that nostalgia is not necessarily a regressive longing for the past, but can also accommodate progressive ideals for change. One participant, for example, spent much of the interview enthusiastically describing his recent discovery of a new and exotic product known as etherium gold, which, he told me had originated with the pharaohs of ancient Egypt 2000 years ago, and which he was able to obtain online: ....this is a white powder a nano-particle white powder. They found that throughout Egypt ... there's some temples in Syria that are Egyptian that have every pharaoh there 64 and it's dedicated to gold and all they found inside was massive amounts of this white powder. And this is what they put in the bread and the mana and everything else that the pharaohs ate that let them contact the after-life. (Cliff) It seemed as if its main appeal for him was in its novelty, exoticism and links to a distant mythical past rather than any particular naturalness. But rather than nostalgia for his own, or an ancient past, he appeared to be using the novel substance as a means to progress and renew his life in which, he told me, he had at times become trapped in negative and damaging behaviour patterns which he regretted and had now put behind him. Some participants, in contrast, were uncomfortable about the idea of exotic products, commenting on their decided preference for products to which they felt a connection to their own environment: I feel like our natural environment where we live affects us and what is grown in that environment I feel generally is what is good for the climate and the people that are living there. And when you start getting things from overseas and all over the place out of season and what not, then sometimes you can disturb the balance that you have to you as a person living in the environment and right now. (Bryony) People with this kind of preference for the local product have been described elsewhere as 'ethnocentric' consumers (Batra et al., 2000; Haque & Maheshwari, 2015), that is, individuals who relate their health and social practices to feelings about their own culture and environmental surroundings. Olivia was another such individual; even more than Bryony, she voiced active disapproval of exoticism and found it to be a form of cultural appropriation, an attempt to 'buy' into traditions that had no place out of their own context: I have a distaste for a lot of that ... new ageism, stuff that goes into things that I don't understand why you would want to connect to something that is so foreign. ... On the other hand, if you are connecting to traditions that your ancestors have practised for thousands and thousands of years but have been displaced through colonisation or other effects of migration, for me, that's an entirely appropriate way back to source. (Olivia) Olivia is not alone in viewing the 'exotic' in this way. Davidov (2011:483), while primarily discussing eco-primitivism, has referred to the appeal of the exotic as a form of retro- colonialism, where fragments of nature serve to connect the user to \"post-colonial fantasies of an authentic pre-industrial harmonious fusion of nature and culture\". But this too is not as clear 65 cut as it seems; what is 'natural' and what is 'exotic' evolves over time and space and is never static. Many plants now perceived as being local and natural in New Zealand, are not natives, but arrived with European colonisation in the 19th century. Centuries before that, the kumara, a staple of the pre-European diet for Maori, was in its turn brought to New Zealand from islands in the Pacific and adapted for New Zealand growing conditions (Law, 1970; Yen, 1963). Additionally, participants' interpretations of what was 'naturally' found locally tended to vary depending on their own life trajectory. Bryony quoted above, indicated that for her, it was plants that grew in her own garden and nearby, regardless of where they were originally from. Devon, on the other hand, who had come to New Zealand quite recently as an adult, did not consider the herbs she knew from her home country as being 'local' to her new surroundings: So that is perhaps another unique thing here, that we use western medicine - or western herbs, which actually have to be [imported] - well some of them grow here now - but they are not natives here. (Devon) Even very recent 'exotics' that have come into favour as components in natural products, such as the goji berry plant (Lycium barbarum), can now be bought from plant nurseries in New Zealand by the home gardener, demonstrating that being 'local' is a dynamic concept that resists being bounded to a physical place once it becomes established in another. Modern communications and population movements, globalisation and multiculturalism give rise to co-mingling and fusion of cultures that at the same time \"dilutes, enriches and alters individual cultures\" (Craig & Douglas, 2006: 323). So the assemblage of the 'local' and 'exotic' is made up of individual connections, and is continually evolving, including, in the world of herbal medicines. Another evolving meaning of the 'natural' that came to light in the study was an implication that natural products are environmentally sustainable and therefore an ethically responsible choice (Soper, 1998: 2; Todd, 2004). A considerable number of the participants commented on their preference for the Kiwiherb(r) range of herbal medicines, where both the name and the use of New Zealand native plant products indicate that it is literally, 'rooted' in the local environment: ...we are developing a whole lot more natural based products within New Zealand compared to way back then, which is interesting...maybe it's the clean, green image that we have. ... Maybe the greeny side of people in New Zealand who are conscious of the carbon footprint as well, whether that comes into it ... accessibility, I think we are more looking after our own in our own little space."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","inner_id":3,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":114,"annotations":[{"id":114,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.120945Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.120945Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":493.113,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"c6a53f51-68f1-4660-9359-604a366118de","import_id":5,"last_action":null,"task":4,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f855151c-project-2-at-2024-04-30-16-16-691636e5.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"(Lesley) 66 Here Lesley is drawing on discourses that construct the New Zealand environment as a pristine land of natural landscapes symbolised by the international marketing promotion that has been used to advertise New Zealand tourism and agricultural products as '100 percent pure' (Desmarais, 2015; Patil, 2019). Though easily deconstructed to show that the New Zealand environment cannot live up to this impossible claim, the belief that New Zealand has a unique and largely unspoilt natural environment has tended to persist. The use of New Zealand products in supplements resonated strongly with other 'ethnocentric' (Batra et al., 2000) participants who valued home-grown products that they found familiar and culturally congruent with their own upbringing. Lesley's comment about being conscious of the carbon footprint also touches on the concept of reducing the environmental impact of bringing imported products in to New Zealand when they can be produced on site, and implicitly draws on concepts related to the wider discourses around climate change and human behavior that affect the natural environment (Holden et al., 2014; Stephenson et al., 2013). While the Kiwiherb(r) products appear to live up to their reputation of using (at least some) home grown ingredients, labels that claim naturalness do not always live up to what they imply. The phenomenon of 'borrowing' an aura of naturalness but without any grounds for doing so is known as 'greenwashing' and is a way of promoting sales by linking to discourses of sustainability and naturalness that resonate with consumers. 'Greenwashing' has been described in the supplement field (Todd, 2004), as well as in the marketing of organic foods and fair trade products (Jaffee, 2010; Jaffee & Howard, 2010). Moreover, even if products themselves are genuinely naturally grown and produced, there may be other perverse effects if a particular plant becomes the focus of a wave of global attention. One participant raised this issue in relation to the surge of interest in honey and oils from manuka [Leptospermum scoparium], a New Zealand native plant that grew prolifically in her home area: An American company had come in to the Hokianga [a rural area in the north of New Zealand] and bought some land up there that had loads and loads of manuka. There were acres of it full of manuka .... it is going to America and they are putting it in plasters and bandages. ... What that spoke to me was, why didn't Maori get on to this? Why are we leaving Americans to come and buy our land and we can't even buy it? Then they speak of - we are going to bring work into the Hokianga, we're going to bring revenue - of course it hasn't happened. I think they are getting Norwegians and Germans, you know, tourists, student visas, to work, to do that, and not the locals. (Marama) 67 Not only had the local population missed any benefit as Marama suggested, but the swift rise in global demand for manuka products had been acutely negative. The so-called 'manuka honey wars' had broken out; thefts, vandalism, violent beatings of competitors, outsiders coming into the area, uplifting or sabotaging competitors' hives, poisoning the bees, and putting long-term beekeepers who understood the sensitivity of the local ecology out of business (Neal, 2016; Roy, 2016). A different set of adverse consequences from the same popular demand for naturally grown herbal products in Nepal was reported by Kunwar et al (2013). Whereas local people had been able to gain an extra means of livelihood for their families by gathering and selling the plants (Larsen & Olsen, 2007; Olsen & Larsen, 2003), the lack of an overall strategic plan for sustainability had \"pushed many of Nepal's medicinal plants to the brink of extinction\" (Kunwar et al., 2013:1). So while both the manuka products and the Nepalese medical plants were certainly 'natural' by one reckoning, they resulted in environmentally and ethically questionable situations. This kind of blending of the natural into the different, new, or 'other' also seemed to be linked to a further phenomenon that I encountered on my pharmacy and health store visits. Some of the products in the 'natural health' section were branded with names that made them seem more like a chemical or pharmaceutical, rather than anything obviously 'natural'. Examples included CoQ10 (Co-enzyme Q10), Kyolic (a garlic extract), and curcumin (from turmeric), all of which are derived directly from natural substances. Kerry, a participant who worked in one of the stores I visited showed me sample sachets of both Kyolic and CoQ10 that she gave out as a trial for customers who wanted something that might enable them to cut down or even substitute for some of their prescribed medicines that they believed were giving them negative reactions: ...there seems to be a little bit more sensitivity coming in to drugs. I can't take that because it reacts with me so I take CoQ10 and Kyolic instead for my blood pressure, that sort of thing. I'm not sure whether that's because I am dealing with it more often or because that's a trend. (Kerry) Deliberately branding products with a name that conveys neither what the product does, nor the common name for what it is, seems a puzzling strategy. Several things may possibly be happening here at once that make the seemingly counter-intuitive label work: the name is both novel and intriguing so that a certain mystique is generated for those who are attracted to something 'other'. Moreover, because it is shelved in the 'natural health' space and alongside products with functional names for similar conditions, those whose prime need is to stick with 'natural' products may be reassured, even though the name seems obscure at first sight. 68 Conversely, it may also be that the more 'medicinal' sounding name may reassure others new to or suspicious of 'alternatives'. Deconstructing the natural shows how it \"opens things up for] the \"incoming of the other\" (Derrida, 1997: 77) and undermines the notion of a sharp dividing line between what is natural and what is not. The participants' comments about what was natural were at once far more nuanced and also far more productive of change and development than the polarised oppositions that see separately bounded categories between natural products and prescribed medicines. A spectrum of meanings of naturalness could be accommodated within the assemblage around supplements no matter where individual participants drew their own line between what they considered natural or not. The diverse products, public and private discourses, experiences and understandings of the participants and the unique connections that each person had made between them formed a complex network of actions and interactions around ideas of what was natural. Past and present, novelty and tradition, exoticism and localness, environmental sustainability, all were tangled together and connected to naturalness in different ways. Names of products could be highlighted as simple natural substances, or presented to appear more like a medicine. Older ideas might fall out of favour and be discarded, or just as easily be reformulated or reimagined to suit changing times. The connections and relationships between the many components could be arranged and rearranged according to the interpretation of different individuals, in a constant state of immanence, connecting to \"the semantic and pragmatic contents of statements, to collective assemblages of enunciation, to a whole micropolitics of the social field\" (Deleuze and Guattari, 1987: 6). Together all these perspectives of the natural formed an intricate and complex rhizomatic assemblage that was constantly in a state of becoming and changing. Woven into the components of the natural was a further notion as yet only touched on; the idea that natural products have integrity; they are pure, complete in themselves, whole and untampered with by human interference. As such they are often described as 'holistic' and the use of them to be a part of an 'holistic' approach to health care. The next section of the chapter examines the various interpretations of this ubiquitous word that were manifested in the discussions with the participants. Holism and holistic health Studies examining the preferences of users of alternative products and therapies have commonly accepted participants' assertions of the preference for 'holistic' health without 69 further analysis or comment (Barrett et al., 2003; Doel & Segrott, 2003; Sointu, 2013; Vickers et al., 2006). Peters et al (2003: 121) for example, report without further comment, that the people they talked to stated they wished \"to take a more holistic approach to treatment and health.\" Similarly, Vickers et al. (2005: 5) found that participants in their study \"preferred a more natural way of healing embedded in a holistic approach\". The underlying idea in all these attempts seems to be that holistic health care is everything that 'reductionist' health care is not (Bell et al., 2002; Plsek & Greenhalgh, 2001). Participants, too, talked about holistic health as a desirable approach that went beyond biomedical care. Lesley, a health store owner, for example described her approach to clients as: .... putting the jigsaw puzzle together for them and then I can make a much better go at supporting whatever system is down or supporting where they are coming from - a holistic approach, if you know what I mean. (Lesley) The term holistic as it is used in general speech today, however, is itself an assemblage of ideas that span almost any area of human endeavour. While 'holistic' is frequently seen in relation to health and health care, it is also used as a descriptor for fields as diverse as computing (Soomro et al., 2016), religion (Parmer & Rogers, 1997), organic farming (Hole et al., 2005), entrepreneurialism (Jensen, 2014), human resources management (Hecklau et al., 2016), the organisation of government services (Dawes et al., 2004) and many more. Health practitioners who describe themselves as holistic range from registered medical professionals in general practice on the one hand (RNZGP, Undated), to alternative therapists offering services such as \"a holistic pulsing journey to peace awareness and healing\" (Murray, Undated). It is no wonder then there is a \"plurality of understandings of holism, [that] encapsulate a fluid spectrum of perspectives\"(Nissen, 2011: 80) covering scientific, sociological and metaphysical world views. As Kretchmar (2013: 23) notes succinctly, \"much traffics under the name of holism today\". There are two vastly different philosophical approaches to holism. The first of these, the cosmic or metaphysical view of holism, has its origins in the eastern religions of Hinduism, Taoism, and Buddhism (Cobb et al., 2012; Erickson, 2007; Shroff, 2011). Holism in this sense is the belief that all matter, whether human or non-human, is unified by a life force; the self is merely a small part of the collective which in turn is part of the wider cosmos (Joshanloo, 2014; Shroff, 2011). The abnegation of the self and its desires are viewed as the way to achieve inner peace and harmony rather than the individualism and autonomy which are more generally admired in Western societies (Ricard, 2011; Shamasundar, 2008). The same fundamental belief in a unifying life force that permeates all matter is also shared by many indigenous cultures including Canadian First 70 Nations (Auger et al., 2016; Hunter et al., 2006), African and South American traditional healing systems (Izquierdo, 2005; Truter, 2007). Similarly, in the Maori world, the life force (mauri) exists in all things, binding people to the environment and to the whole cosmos (Mark & Lyons, 2010; Roberts et al., 1995): Everything is related - people (living and dead), land, sea, flora and fauna, and the spiritual world. Land, sea, wind, and other environmental elements .... A person's well- being [is] intimately linked to the wellbeing of all others, human or non-human (Waitangi Tribunal, 2011: 64). In the metaphysical view of holism, an individual is intimately connected with everything around them and their health and wellbeing will be disrupted if their body, mind, and spirit are out of balance within themselves, or within their wider family, society or natural environment. The other major approach to holism was first proposed by Smuts in his 1926 publication Holism and Evolution (Erickson, 2007; Freeman, 2005; Nissen, 2011). Smuts' defined holism as a state where the body, mind, and spirit are in perfect balance within each individual. If this state is achieved, the totality constitutes more than the sum of its parts. It is a creative synthesis where \"all parts reciprocally influence and determine each other...\" (Smuts 1926: 86 cited in Nissen 2011:77). Adherents to this view of holism dismiss the life-force, or metaphysical approach to holism as belonging to \"primitive and closed belief systems\" (Baum, 1998). They prefer to distance themselves from it, terming it 'vitalism', and describe it as superstitious, anti-scientific, and lacking in intellectual rigour (Nissen, 2011). Smuts himself described cosmic holism as \"...a vague expression, already ruined by popular use and abuse\" (Smuts 1926: 86 cited in Nissen 2011:77). Much contemporary writing, however, seems to subscribe to neither of the two theoretical approaches entirely but to draw from both in a range of widely different combinations. Where definitions are attempted they seldom agree with one another; some incorporate metaphysical elements while others do not (Erickson, 2007; Goldstein et al., 1988; Hoffmann, 1988; McColl, 1994; Shroff, 2011; Sointu, 2013). One commentator, for example, states that holistic health promotes \"integrative energy that pervades, unites and directs all human dimensions\" (Goddard, 1995: 810), while another (Shroff, 2011: 245) proposes that the term 'holistic health care' can be used \"interchangeably with alternative or complimentary [sic] medicine\". Orthodox medical practices too draw very different meanings from the term. A New Zealand 'integrative' medical practice indicates it follows \"an holistic philosophy...addressing body, mind and spirit\" (Helios Health, Undated), but the definition by the Royal New Zealand College of General 71 Practitioners omits any reference to things spiritual, or even emotional. Their definition, instead, refers to the way health services are provided, contrasting specialist with generalist care: Where hospital doctors often focus on just one part of your body, a GP looks at your whole body, your background, and the environment you live in when diagnosing illnesses and prescribing treatments. This is known as holistic healthcare (RNZGP, Undated). McEvoy and Duffy (2008: 413) attempt to pin down exactly what holism is and provide a detailed analysis of what they term the \"nebulous and subjective\" concept of holism. However, the lengthy table of components they list appears to add further to the confusion and demonstrates the futility of trying to provide a bounded definition. Their efforts underline yet again Derrida's insistence that any attempt to \"totalize, to gather\" into a unified and bounded definition is doomed to failure and will always run up against \"the limit it had to encounter\" (Derrida 1997: 13). My own ideas about holism and holistic health were just as ill-defined at the time of the interviews and I accepted what the participants said without exploring further how they understood the concept of holism. It was only on analyzing the data that I realised how vague and undefined the participants' statements were when they mentioned holistic health, although clearly they all recognised it as something positive to aspire to. None of them referred directly to either of the philosophical approaches to holism, and none reflected on the meaning of the term as several had done when talking about what was natural. Nevertheless, on closer examination of the participants' comments, I was able to distinguish a number of underlying concepts that provided some insights into the meanings that they associated with the aspiration for an holistic approach to caring for their health. Balance and uniqueness of the person Foremost among the ideas participants expressed regarding holistic health were their various interpretations of 'balance'. Balance (or harmony) is an important and uncontroversial concept in holism (McEvoy & Duffy, 2008; Shroff, 2011) and one which is common to both the cosmic 'life force' and the 'integrated individual' theoretical approaches. 72 I would say I am into holistic, without being over the top. I'm into the whole thing about doing the best you can for your body, looking after yourself, everything in moderation kind of. (Frances) Frances here interprets the idea of balance as moderation and avoiding extremes. There is a suggestion in her comment that she applies the idea of balance not only to her physical health but to other areas of her life as well. For Murray on the other hand, the idea of balance was about the physical body alone and the use of supplements was to ensure he had what he believed to be the 'correct' mix of nutrients for good health: ...the unpaired electrons attack unhealthy cells trying to balance themselves. Well if, for whatever reason, the body is slightly run down, the baddies can overwhelm the goodies and invade the body. So if the body is healthy through having all the sufficient minerals, vitamins and amino acids, it can stay at that higher level of health and fitness. (Murray) Wendy similarly focused on the body and the importance that she and her husband placed on \"getting the balance right\" by adding various supplements to their diet in addition to the food they ate. Bryony's views, on the other hand, were more aligned with the concept of the body as an integrated whole; in her view, she said, any health care treatment should be designed to address a person's \"unique way of disharmony\" and restore their \"whole body balance\". Other participants, however, seemed to connect their idea of balance with cosmic holism. In the discussion with Tracy, for example, she referred to being guided by the Maori model of health which uses the metaphor of a house with four pillars, all of which must be equally strong to keep everything in balance."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","inner_id":4,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":115,"annotations":[{"id":115,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":2317,"end":2331,"text":"stomach cancer","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"entity_2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":2455,"end":2464,"text":"aloe vera","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"entity_3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":2232,"end":2241,"text":"aloe vera","labels":["Scientific Plant Name"]},"id":"VU5xLDqGA2","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":2755,"end":2769,"text":"stomach cramps","labels":["Medical Condition"]},"id":"AnatfuVtCd","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"from_id":"entity_3","to_id":"entity_2","type":"relation","direction":"right","labels":["treats_medical_condition"]},{"from_id":"VU5xLDqGA2","to_id":"entity_2","type":"relation","direction":"right","labels":["treats_medical_condition"]},{"from_id":"entity_3","to_id":"AnatfuVtCd","type":"relation","direction":"right","labels":["treats_medical_condition"]}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.120945Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.120945Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1027.898,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"07489e7b-0a42-4d07-a4eb-b970ff1f013f","import_id":6,"last_action":null,"task":5,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f855151c-project-2-at-2024-04-30-16-16-691636e5.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"The creation of an identity and a group of like-minded contacts built around the material 'things' (the products) draws on an assemblage of entrepreneurialism, social capital (Lin, 2007), brand commitment and loyalty (Hur et al., 2011), while also being inspired by the idea of helping (or saving) others whose health is affected. The implicit promise is not only of health and happiness, but also prosperity for those who are prepared to place their trust in the company and its products. Pratt (2000: 456) interprets this strategy as a necessary one to 'win the hearts and minds' of those who work for a network marketing organisation in the absence of regular hours, work colleagues, a physical location, and the psychological contract of job security provided in the traditional workplace. 137 Part of the identity creation appears to be the implicit invitation to the distributor to model themselves on the inspirational life story of the company founder which, as Cardwell (1998:17) describes, commonly follows a nearly identical trajectory in all companies: ...the guru as head of the company [who] ...was told by conventional medicine that he ... had only six weeks\/months\/hours to live. Fortunately they found one or more 'natural' plant based products that cured their cancer ... and now they have a fundamental and evangelistic desire to sell their amazing product to the world. This was indeed closely paralleled by four stories that were related to me by different participants about four different brands of products. Each time it was presented as a type of hero's journey (Campbell, 1973); the quest of the company founder to overcome a health threat to themselves or a close family member; the breakthrough discovery after a period of isolation or intense study; the struggle to overcome others' disbelief; and their subsequent dedication to sharing their discovery for the betterment of the world and making a fortune in the process. Here is just one of them: The history behind it was a guy from South Korea [who] was a billionaire. He was an industrialist and the story is that he got stomach cancer. So he went and lived up in the mountains somewhere and started eating an aloe plant, and basically lived off an aloe vera plant for quite a long time and then went back down and got tested and his stomach cancer was gone. So he took all his money and basically sold all his assets from his steel and invested it in this technology for aloe vera plants and then built these big farms and then started a system where you buy in, you sell it to your friends and you get a profit. .... they would give this big seminar to everyone and tell them how this special herbal - medicine I guess - has changed their life. Everything from people's stomach cramps to all these different types of healing, almost like miracles that they've experienced with this. (Duncan) These narratives with their tales of the quest, seclusion from the world, and return with \"the goods of salvation\" (Rey, 2004: 331), had unmistakable overtones that resonated with the myths, legends, and religious figures that were described in the background chapter. Albertson (2011: 127) draws attention to the implicit appeal of religious language in societies where \"...religion has old roots in the lives of many ... people carry emotional and cognitive residue from their pasts that are at work in their current political attitudes and choices.\" Even for those without these religious echoes from their past, the narratives in fairy tales abound with the 138 same elements of quest and salvation. These generic tales or \"ur-narratives ...contain the seeds of many genres\" (Berger 2016: 71); in them the heroes are often aided by magic objects or 'things' through which they manage to find the inner strength to prevail over difficulties. The universal appeal of the hero(ine) winning the battle against the odds would seem to be not only deeply rooted in the ancient myths of humanity's distant past but to be always evolving, rearranging itself to any context without losing its intrinsic qualities. Rey (2004: 333) has drawn attention to the way these ur-narratives are echoed in economic success stories of this sort, when the company founder, the 'charismatic prophet' produces symbolic goods for benefit of the people. Even in network marketing the reworking of these themes with their origins in the distant past demonstrates that \"mythology shows itself to be as amenable as life itself to the obsessions and requirements of the individual, the race, the age\" (Campbell 1973: 330). All the companies named by study participants were based in the United States, where there is a lengthy history of network marketing companies being investigated by the US Food and Drug Administration for deceptive marketing practices or conducting illegal pyramid selling schemes focused around the material products (Anonymous, 2003; Berg, 1994; Herbig & Yelkurm, 1997). One controversial area has been the evangelistic nature of network company distributors in their efforts to recruit others. The fascination and fear associated with such companies has led to them being described as cults (Bhattacharya & Mehta, 2000; Krzywirzeka, 2013) who use \"mind control\" (Pratt, 2000: 456) to exert overly strong attachments among their adherents. Certainly those participants who were currently distributors for network marketing companies at the time I spoke to them were fulsome and evangelistic in the way they spoke about the products (the 'things'). They demonstrated high levels of commitment, enthusiasm, and a sense of making a worthwhile contribution by making the company products available to people who needed help. While they at no time appeared to be in the grip of a cult, I gained the impression that too much confidence in the company's products could lead to potentially overblown claims about what their 'things' could achieve. One network marketer gave an account of stepping in to help an acquaintance who was awaiting an amputation in hospital because of diabetic complications: So it is a very simple programme getting rid of diabetes and our shake just puts your blood sugar right straight away. ... Well! The next day he is sitting up in bed and he is coming to life already. Each day they said, Oh, he's getting stronger by the day. Well, when they got him back [to hospital], his blood sugar was exactly right ... Everything was coming right after four days and then the surgeon looked at his leg and said, \"I must have made a mistake. He doesn't need his leg off!\" (Clara) 139 Clara here represents the 'shake' that she gave to her acquaintance as being the 'goods of salvation' mentioned above, that saved his leg. Molly, however, was much more reserved about what she claimed to do herself, noting that she would never give more than generic advice but would always refer to other sources in her company: There's certain things you can and can't do. So if you are not a qualified nutritionist you can't give nutrition advice. .... You've just got to be really careful and that's fair enough because if you are not qualified I don't feel you should do it anyway. (Molly) Another major criticism of network marketing has highlighted the high rates of turnover among disillusioned distributors, with some said to be filled with hatred for the companies they formerly belonged to (Pratt, 2000; Mswelli and Sargeant, 2001). There were a few study participants who were ex-network marketers, but they were neutral about the companies they had been involved with. It seemed that they had mostly been drawn in to oblige a friend or relative but and had never fully 'bought in' emotionally to the assemblage of discourses that hinged on the 'thing power' of the products that the companies sold. Moreover, the expense of the products deterred younger people who were not yet well established financially and they found the commitment more than they could maintain on their limited budget: I think it was about $60 ... I remember I got a discount I think of 20%. That was still a lot for me anyway. I think they would expect you to get a new one [pack] every one or two months. I can't really afford that. (Iris) Duncan also had a history of being both a user and distributor and although he had extricated himself from the company without great difficulty, he admitted that the entanglement of personal and business relationships had made it awkward. He too had found it an expensive exercise: It's a community; you make friends, you get involved and it almost turns into a community group. You know, you go to meetings together and you make friends... And then they would say, well you know, you purchase this. The thing was that a bottle like this [indicating size] was about $90 so it would last you a month. (Duncan) Network marketing proved to be an interesting way of examining the assemblage of actants around supplements from a different angle. It encompassed the same levers of supply and demand, and the same discourses of naturalness and risk. However, it differed in that it drew directly on personal commitment to a particular company and appealed more intensely to 140 emotional engagement with 'things' which not only had value as supplements but also symbolised the underlying narrative of altruism and salvation more overtly entangled with the economic values of entrepreneurialism and personal profit (Berger, 2016: 71), in a way that was absent from those participants who sold products in health stores and pharmacies. Conclusion In concluding this chapter, it is useful to return to Bennett's words quoted at the beginning of the chapter, framing non-human matter as: ...an actant inside and alongside intention-forming, morality-(dis)obeying, language using, reflexivity wielding and culture making human beings and as an inducer-producer of salient, public effects (Bennett, 2010: 39). Assemblages of ingested matter, whether supplements, pharmaceuticals or ordinary foods, whether helpful or harmful, have been analysed from countless medical, public health, commercial, and sociological perspectives but human behaviour has almost always been at the centre of these analyses (Flegal et al., 2012; Gotay et al., 2013; Mayes, 2015; Mitchell, 2001; Wang & Lim, 2012). Here, in contrast, non-human things have been brought into the foreground as vital matter that acted as an important catalyst in the participants' lives. What may have begun as a minor or random decision to take a supplement 'thing' appeared to have had the power to generate physical, mental and spiritual effects in their lives and given them hope for the future, even if their basic conditions were still troublesome. They had developed a personal story around their supplement use that resulted from a maze of connections in which the material products - the things - had a central role in making their story what it was. The meaning was what mattered; the precise mechanism by which the 'thing' mattered, appeared to be irrelevant. Humans organize their experiences into temporarily meaningful episodes. Narrative is both a mode of reasoning and a mode of representation. People can \"apprehend\" the world narratively and people can \"tell\" about the world narratively. ... Explanation in the narrative mode is contextually embedded, whereas the logico-scientific explanation is extracted from spatial and temporal events. Both modes are rational ways of making meaning (Richardson, 1990: 118). Moreover, the meaning they drew from their products was not static but always in process, constantly forming and reforming as it evolved and changed. The participants were part of this 141 dynamic evolution, contributing to its onward movement through the effects of their actions to research, purchase and consume supplements to look after their health. These activities were also changing the participants themselves as they gained experience and expertise as 'supplement users'. The effect of their interaction with the 'thing power' of the supplements appeared to have given them a sense of control over their health care options and to be an important influence in their decision making not only for themselves but in their interactions with orthodox health care options. The next chapter moves on to tackle the issue of power and expertise over health and to look at the part supplements played in identity building for participants in their ongoing life journey. 142 Chapter 6: Supplements: through responsibility and expertise to power Introduction The previous chapter ended by looking forward to the sense of control that the participants experienced through making independent decisions around supplements and health. This chapter examines the assemblage of ideas that had come together to build that sense of control. Primarily, these focused around two prominent themes that were raised by the participants: being responsible about their health, and developing expertise in doing so. The participants clearly saw themselves as responsible people who were taking every care to look after their health, yet they were quite well aware that supplement use was not endorsed as a responsible practice by health experts. They did not see this as a conflict, however, but viewed their supplements as something extra that they could do over and above following the recommended precepts about living a healthy life. Moreover, they explained, they were becoming their own experts about supplements and their uses, searching out information from a wide range of sources and putting their new knowledge into practice as they learned more about them. For those participants who also sold supplements, this included building expertise in how to advise others in their use. To examine these issues relating to the tension between authorised advice and independent decisions that deviate from it, this chapter draws from Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality as they are manifested in the modern neoliberal state. As Foucault described it, biopower is the guiding and shaping of citizens to be \"eminently governable\" neoliberal subjects (Lorenzini, 2018: 155). Biopower operates through what Foucault termed the 'conduct of conduct' (Burchell et al., 1991; Foucault, 1988; Lemke, 2002), that is, the provision of guidance by officially authorised experts so that people internalise the approved way to behave and do so freely, but in a way which also serves the interests of the state (Danaher et al., 2000; Petersen & Lupton, 1996). In the sphere of health, governmentality works by encouraging people to take responsibility for looking after themselves according to the advice of medical professionals and public health experts who are credentialed and sanctioned by the state. They are seen as the repository of expert knowledge which is deployed in \"shaping the thoughts and actions of subjects in order to make them more useful and 'governable'\"(Petersen & Lupton, 1996: 14). Choosing to follow the advice and make 'correct' choices, they reduce their likelihood of becoming unwell and therefore creating a burden for themselves and for the state to look 143 after. Responsible citizens who have internalised this advice and willingly submit to this 'conduct of conduct', have the greatest likelihood of being considered well-ordered and healthy, thereby contributing to the productivity of the state as a whole. While individuals are not forced to conform to these norms, they are encouraged to see them as being in their own interests. Nevertheless, many people do resist being 'conducted' according to recommended advice. They may continue to smoke, drink too much alcohol or keep on with 'unhealthy eating' that makes them overweight, even though they know quite well that these are not considered responsible health practices. Yet all these behaviours are quite legal and the products that enable them are easily available, often heavily advertised with special offers and discounting that make them even more attractive. Viewed from an economic perspective, the buying and selling of such things is generally seen as uncontroversial, for they fit with the modern neoliberal state's focus on ensuring that the freedom of the market is maintained, that consumers keep spending, and that the economy continues to grow. The interests of the market, therefore, frequently run directly counter to expert advice on health and take precedence over policies which would be likely to constrain commercial activity and inhibit growth. Instead, the onus is placed on individuals to be 'responsible' and refrain from indulging in behaviours which are not approved (Herrick, 2011). Clearly, supplements are in a different category from these overtly harmful products, but they too are frowned on by health experts, albeit for different reasons. There are continuing calls for more restrictions on their availability or to bring them under the control of health professionals. Yet the importance of the commercial activity these products generate (Grand View Research, 2019) appears to outweigh the voices of health experts when it comes to policy making and regulations. By resisting authorised health advice and instead turning to the market for their products, however, it may be that individuals who wish to use or sell supplements are merely exchanging one form of being conducted for another, that is, the subtle and less overtly stated form of control that commercial interests exercise over people who buy their products (Kasabov, 2004). Foucault's concept of governmentality has been taken up and applied to this viewpoint as well, showing that the ever increasing use of digital surveillance is continually and relentlessly gathering and analysing the personal details and habits of those who buy, whether they shop online or in person (Ganesh, 2016). This digital surveillance has been likened to an \"electronic super-Panopticon\" (Zwick & Knott, 2009: 227) that constructs consumers as passive commodities to be manipulated by personalised advertising (Couldry & Turow, 2014). They are seen as being induced to spend money on products that merely enrich commercial companies 144 and their shareholders and that do nothing to benefit the people that buy them (Boyd & Crawford, 2012; Brayne, 2017; Ganesh, 2016). This construction, however, would seem to underestimate the power of ordinary citizens. The tensions between the two competing forces - that is, the conduct of citizens by expert health advice and the machinations of the market to control them - create areas of \"fragility and blindspots\" where the modern neoliberal state is at cross purposes with itself (Lorenzini, 2018: 157). Individuals such as the participants may engage in what Foucault termed \"strategic games between liberties\" (Foucault 1988 cited in Lemke 2002: 53), that is, they may use their freedom creatively to exploit those tensions and resist being 'conducted' quite so much (Lorenzini, 2018). In effect, this response by individuals is another example of the far reaching interconnections that are possible in the rhizomatic network of actants that are interconnected in a moving assemblage around a particular issue. By exploring and experimenting with ways to benefit from all the options that are available from both orthodox health advice and the commercial market, and resisting and avoiding those aspects they dislike, they may develop expertise in using both to maximum advantage for themselves, thereby gaining a sense of control and independence from both. This chapter has three sections that discuss these issues in the light of the participants' reports. The first focuses on the participants' construction of themselves as responsible and morally 'good' people who took great care to look after their health."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T16:31:00.116961Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":null,"comment_authors":[]}]
