This herb is mostly produced for domestic or re-gional markets and its production in Europe is believed to be increasing in indoor settings, under the control of orga-nized crime groups. Usually, the authorities are faced with the problem of a lack of information on where the canna-bis was grown. This material is also widely consumed by the population in each country and therefore establishing of system for classifying the origin of this plant can be a challenge for the scientists and a great benefit for the po-lice authorities. When drugs are concerned and especially for the fo-rensic purposes, the most significant compounds in Canna-bis samples are cannabinoids, terpenophenolic compounds unique to cannabis. For the forensic practice, the most im-portant cannabinoids are: 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC), cannabinol (CBN) and cannabidiol (CBD). The first compound, 9-THC is psychoactive component, while the other two mentioned cannabinoids are not. On the other, hand, transition metals are important for plant growth and they are distributed in different cells, in certain concen-trations due to the established homeostasis. Hemp has the ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals. Bearing in mind the lack of literature on possible correlations between content of cannabinoids in Cannabis plants and metals in both Cannabis samples and soil where the plants were cul-tivated, multivariate methods were applied aiming to assist in determination of origin of cannabis and its production. Materials and methodsYoung plants of Cannabis sativa species had been seized by the Police authorities as material planted by the criminal groups on different locations in Serbia. The plants were grown illegally under controlled indoor conditions by applying certain levels of temperature, humidity and inten-sity of light. The plants were randomly selected from the plantations in the early growing stage for the purpose of fo-rensic analyses. The rhizosphere soil from the root zone at a depth of 5-10 cm was sampled. The plant samples were further separated into roots, stems and leaves. The roots parts were cleaned from traces of soil, washed with de-ionised water and dried. The Cannabis leaves were dried and grounded to a powder. The mass of 33.3 mg of dried leaves material was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol, shak-en in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and filtered. The fil-trate was heated for 12 min at 150 degS in order to run decar-boxylation of the cannabinoid acids into cannabinoids. The evaporated extracts were reconstituted with 2 mL of meth-anol. The resulting solution of 1 uL, for each sample was applied on the TLC plate together with the volume of 1 uL of the dissolved reference materials: D9-THC, CBN and CBD in methanol in concentration of 0.05 mg\/mL and 1 uL of pure methanol. Mobile phase was n-hexane: diethyl ether in ratio 4 : 1. Visualization was conducted by the dis-solved Azoic Diazo Component in 0.1 M sodium hydrox-ide in water. In the second step, 20 mg of each sample were dis-solved in 5 mL methanol, shaken in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue was reconstituted with 2 mL of methanol. 1 uL of the re-sulting solution for each sample was injected into the GC-FID system in order to analyse the content of cannabinoids. S2 OP 56130Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 129 - 130 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsOral presentationsFor the purpose of elemental analysis, the sampled soils, roots, stems and leaves were subjected to microwave-as-sisted acid digestion, according to a known procedure (Ra-zic et al., 2006). The determination of the cannabinoids by thin lay-er chromatography (TLC) with plates made of aluminium and covered with silica gel with fluorescence indicator of UV254, by conducting the semi quantitative analyses.The determination of the cannabinoids was performed using an Agilent GC System, Model 7890A, fitted with a Flame Ionization Detector. The conditions were as fol-lows: column HP-5 (30 m x 320 um x 0.25 um), injection temperature: 250 degC, splitless mode, oven program: initial temperature 150 degC for 0 min, heating rate 15 degC\/min to 300 degC and held for 5 min, nitrogen flow rate: 46 mL\/min. The determination of the Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ca and Mg was conducted on a Perkin-Elmer Model 5000 atomic ab-sorption spectrophotometer, operated under optimized measurement (Razic et al., 2005). The determination of the Cr was accomplished using a Perkin-Elmer Model 5000 atomic absorption spectrophotometer with a graph-ite furnace HGA 400 Automatic Burner Control (Razic et al., 2006).Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and Minitab 13.20 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA), for Windows software packages. Results and discussionSince the roots contain only trace amounts of these sub-stances while the stems, branches and twigs have less than the leaf material, the cannabinoid content was measured only in the leaves. For the purpose of comparison of the can-nabinoid content in the young plants and the mature one the semi quantitative method of the TLC was conducted and the difference in the cannabinoids content was detected. The cannabinoids content in the leaves of the exam-ined cannabis plants was determined by external calibra-tion. The values varied from 0.03 to 1.47 mg\/mL for THC and from 0.11 to 1.12 mg\/mL for CBN. The lowest lev-els were from 0.003 to 0.06 mg\/mL for CBN, what is rea-sonable since the level of this cannabinoid, as degradation product of THC, increases with time during storage of can-nabis plants. Quantification of metals was performed by external cal-ibration. The accuracy of the methods was checked by anal-ysis of a standard reference material, NIST SRM 1547 - Peach Leaves and NIST SRM 2711 - Montana II Soil, when satisfactory recoveries (90.06 - 115.35%) were obtained.The objective of this study was to analyse the corre-lations of seven metals and three main cannabinoids us-ing multivariate methods of analysis. After preliminary tests (Ryan-Joiner and Grubbs tests) the concentration data were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) in order to highlight any relations between the elements. Four principal components (PCs) appeared to account for 89.42% of the variance of the data. These factors are re-lated to the sources of the elements and cannabinoids in the studied samples. The first factor comprises Mn, THC and CBN with high loadings. A correlation like this indi-cates that they arise from the same sources. Fe and Cr show significant positive loadings in the second factor and are negatively correlated with Zn and CBD with high nega-tive loading. The third factor is dominantly loaded by Cu as an essential element; a constituent of co-enzymes im-portant for a plant cycle. It is also correlated with Mg, with a high but negative loading. These correlations led to the consideration of the biosynthesis of cannabinoids and the involvement of metals as cofactors in the enzymatic cata-lyzed synthesis cycles (De Meijer et al., 2002; Pate, 1994; Radosavljevic-Stevanovic et al., 2014; Sirikantaramas et al., 2005; Taura et al., 2007).ConclusionThis work is conducted in order to determine whether the metals content in rhizosphere and cannabis can affect the levels of three important cannabinoids. The obtained results were subjected to chemometrics evaluation which gave an opportunity to get a better insight into role of met-als in the biosynthesis of cannabinoids. Identified patterns could be helpful in tracking the origin of Cannabis plant and its product adding a value to the applied analytical and chemometrics methods in forensic sciences.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* jelena@ff.ukim.edu.mkBackground Falsification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) has been recognized as an important health issue since a series of health scares involving large numbers of casualties happened when altered APIs escaped detection in routine analytical testing (Degardin et al., 2014). API falsification usually means discrepancy between the information for declared manufacturer and the actual manufacturer of the APIs used for manufacturing of fin-ished dosage forms (FDF). Any form of tampering the con-tent or information about the content might affect the qual-ity of an API and therefore constitutes a direct threat to the health of patients. Since the reason for any falsification is fast and easy money, there is no general rule what APIs can be subjected to falsification. For any substance that can bring economic benefits to the manufacturer \/ distributor there is a potential risk to be falsified. The conventional analytical approach often fails to de-tect falsification since the quality and quantity of the API is within the standards. Instead, methods that allow for dis-tinguishing API samples and determining the source of APIs suspected for falsification are needed. Alternative ap-proach must include broader analytical window using spe-cific techniques to reveal some characteristic analytical in-formation, such as impurity profile, spectral data, physico-chemical constants, etc., thus creating an 'API fingerprint' database. APIs can be characterized, compared and clas-sified based on features revealed from such 'fingerprints', using chemometric methods, like different pattern recog-nition techniques (PRT) (Acevska et al., 2015; Petrusevs-ki et al., 2015).The aim of this research was to give an overview of analytical and chemometric methods used to differentiate the origin of the samples based on a 'fingerprint' database by the discriminatory matching of specific analytical fea-tures of the specific API.API fingerprinting API fingerprinting is the common name of a group of analytical applications for detection, identification and quantitative determination of related substances and oth-er impurities. Impurity profiling (organic, inorganic im-purities, residual solvents, enantiomeric purity), chemi-cal characterization (polymorphism\/solvatomorphism) and other contaminants (radioactivity) of the APIs requires ad-vanced and robust fingerprint method. It usually comprise a set of several highly specific techniques, like: liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometer (LC\/MS, GC\/MS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), & differential termogravimetric analysis (TG\/DTG), Furrier-transformed infrared (FTIR), near infrared (NIR), Raman or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR); in-ductively coupled plasma combined with optical emission (ICP-OES) or mass spectrometry (ICP\/MS), X-ray diffrac-tion (XRD) etc. The characteristic and reproducible chemi-cal features revealed during the API fingerprinting are used for discriminating between samples. This data highlights the API fingerprinting as core activity in modern drug anal-ysis and tool for getting reliable results for combating API falsification. Pattern recognition of API fingerprintsPattern recognition techniques that can be applied to API fingerprinting consist of two general areas; unsuper-vised or supervised. From the characterization of the sam-ples of known origin, predictive models can be built and S2 OP 57132Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 131 - 132 (2016)Oral presentationsPharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairstested with new samples of unknown composition. By de-termination of different origins of the APIs, their falsifica-tion can be detected.In unsupervised pattern recognition (hierarchical clus-ter analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), generally viewed as exploratory data analysis methods, from which natural clusters in the data set can be identi-fied, no knowledge concerning the origin of the samples is necessary. HCA gives no indication of the variables which contribute most to the classification of objects in the data set, unlike PCA, where the loadings indicate the variation contained within each variable. There may be a loss of in-formation in the dendrogram generated by HCA, especial-ly if clusters are not well resolved. However, HCA does present all the variation in the data set, in contrast to PCA where only a percentage of the variation is typically pre-sented (Adams, 2004).In supervised pattern recognition (classification and discriminant analysis (CDA), orthogonal partial least square regression (OPLS\/O2PLS), soft independent mod-eling of class analogy (SIMCA), etc. ), the groupings of samples must be known to allow predictions to take place. These methods require prior knowledge of the sample ori-gin to develop models, which are subsequently used to as-sign unknown samples to a parent group. The OPLS-DA method is well suited for classification of data that have multi-collinear and noisy variables, which is common for many types of chemical data. Refined properties of the OPLS-DA methodology have illustrated how Y-orthogo-nal variation can be useful not only for evaluation, but also for classification, thus rendering a PLS-DA\/SIMCA hybrid discriminatory model (Bylesjo et al., 2006).Validation of the classification method The outcome of the investigation on API falsification should be accurate and reliable. For sample authentica-tion purposes, it is essential to ensure that their affiliation is properly defined (Gonzalez, 2007). In other words, de-tection of false negatives (excluding sample that belongs to the class) and false positive (includes a sample that does not belong to the class) results must be enabled."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-09T09:32:50.320021Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T12:33:41.648604Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":279,"annotations":[{"id":295,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":4271,"end":4282,"text":"indigestion","labels":["Medical

investigations of failures or action levels, a specific method is usually preferable.For the swab sampling method it is necessary to deter-mine: the percent recovered with the swab extraction pro-cedure; the effectiveness of the swab at recovering residues from equipment parts surface and the interference of swab materials in the analysis.For the rinse sampling method it is necessary to deter-mine: the percent recovered with the rinse solution extrac-tion procedure; the effectiveness of the rinse solution at re-covering residues from equipment parts surfaces and the interference of the rinse solution in the cleaning procedure and analysis; a correction for recovery efficiency in calcu-lations for acceptable residue levels.The percentage of recovery is important because it will be applied when evaluating the final concentration of residuals.All equipment that comes in contact directly with raw ma-terial -intermediate as well as final product - must be included, because of its potential to act as a possible source for microbi-ological contamination. The microbial testing is performed on the selected surface of the equipment in order to determine the number of colony forming units (CFUs) present. Analysts from Quality Control Department will per-form the analysis on the swab and\/or rinse samples. The results are reported in Quality Assurance Department and the Quality Assurance Manager will give final approval to the reviewed results by signing the final Report (Haider and Asif, 2010b). Validated cleaning process must be subject to change control. Further, revalidation is necessary in order to main-tain the validated status where a differentiation must be made between change-related and periodic revalidation. An effi-cient change control procedure must ensure that the effect of changes on the cleaning validation is identified and that any necessary follow-up action is initiated. Checks must be car-ried-out to verify whether revalidation is necessary follow-ing changes to the cleaning procedure, production equipment and products. A suitable time interval must be determined for the periodic revalidation. Implementation may be stream-lined by linking this to the change control procedure and by reducing the scope of the validation based on a review of data and documents (Borchert and Gomez, 2011b).ConclusionCleaning procedures should be suitable for their in-tended purpose. This should be confirmed by the success-ful execution of a cleaning validation study. The clean-ing validation must ensure that the quality of the product produced using specified equipment is not influenced by cross-contamination from the previous product, cleaning agent's residues or microorganisms.ReferencesBorchert, D., Gomez, R., 2011a.

D., Blvd. A. Makedonski 12, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* anosacheva@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionMost people nowadays suffer from problems with the gastrointestinal tract and indigestion. Gastroguard chew-able tablets are a pharmaceutical solid dosage form from the group of antacids, which contains 680 mg calcium car-bonate and 80 mg magnesium carbonate. Its effect is to act locally and neutralize the gastric acid in the stomach, not depending on the systemic absorption. Therefore it al-leviates the symptoms caused by indigestion and releases the feeling of bloating. The carbonate salts react with the gastric acid in the stomach developing water and miner-al salts as products (http:\/\/www.alkaloid.com.mk\/vademe-cum-step-2.nspx?LekTipId=150). Every pharmaceutical product must be subjected to chemical and microbiological analysis before the batch release. Those analyses are under the jurisdiction of the Quality Control department. In addition to the microbio-logical analysis a working method for determination of the microbiological purity in this pharmaceutical solid form, which would be used in the routine, must be validated. For pharmaceutical solid forms the parameters that should be tested are Total Aerobic Microbial Count (TAMC), Total Yeasts and Molds Count (TYMC) and absence of Esche-richia coli (Ph.Eur., 2013; USP, 2014).The aim of this work is to validate the analytical meth-od which would be used in the routine work for determina-tion of the microbiological purity of Gastoguard chewable tablets as part of the quality control of the product before releasing of the batch. The method should be simple for manipulation and in compliance with the current Europe-an Pharmacopeia. The validation of the method was made by the microbiological team of the Quality Control depart-ment of Alkaloid AD.Materials and methodMaterialsDuring validation of the method standard laborato-ry equipment was used: Laminar flow Class II, Incubators Gallencamp on 20-25 oC; 30-35 oC and 42-44 oC, Bunsen burner, Vortex, glass pipetes, glass tubes intended for mi-crobiological use. In addition to validate the method 10g of Gastoguard chewable tablets were weighted using Sartori-us analytical scale. Buffered sodium chloride peptone wa-ter pH 7 was utilized as medium for dissolving of the sam-ple and for making the dilutions of the culture suspensions. Ready to use nutrient media from BioMerieux were used. 90 mm Petri dishes from Trypcase Soy agar, Sabouraud Dextrose agar and Mac Conkey agar and 100 mL Trypcase Soy broth and 100 mL Mac Conkey broth of the liquid me-dia were used for manipulation.The test microorganisms that were part of this val-idation were the standard microorganisms recommend-ed by the current European Pharmacopeia for the meth-od suitability test. Those are: Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 (Ph.Eur., 2013).Method For determination of the antimicrobial activity and validation of the test method challenge test with the above mentioned microorganisms were used and the microbio-logical method of choice was the surface-spread method and direct inoculation in the liquid media for the test of ab-sence of Escherichia coli. The number of all microorgan-isms applied in the challenge tests was less than 100 cfu\/mL. Each application was made in duplicate and the tem-S2 OP 60138Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 137 - 138 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsOral presentationsperature and the time of incubation depended of the type of the medium. Trypcase Soy agar was incubated for five days at temperature from 30-35 @C, Sabouraud Dextrose agar was incubated for seven days at temperature from 20-25 @C, Trypcase Soy broth was incubated for 24h at tem-perature from 30-35 @C, Mac Conkey broth was incubat-ed for 24h at temperature from 42-44 @C and Mac Conkey agar was incubated for 24h at temperature from 30-35 @C.After the incubation time the relation between the number of the each microorganism dissolved in buffered sodium chloride pepton water pH 7 and the number of the of the same microorganism in the presence of the product was calculated. When verifying the suitability of the plate-count method, a mean of any of the test organisms not dif-fering by a factor greater than 2 must be obtained (Clontz, 2009; Ph.Eur., 2013; USP, 2014).Results and discussionThe results from the determination of the antimicrobial activity of Gastoguard chewable tablets showed that it does not show antimicrobial effect against the used microorgan-isms. In addition to this the working dilution of the product would be 1:10 dilution. The individual challenge test revealed the following results:The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with P. aeruginosa was 93 cfu\/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 89 cfu\/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.04.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with B. spizizenii was 52 cfu\/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 50 cfu\/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.04.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with E. coli was 61cfu\/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the product was 50 cfu\/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.22.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with S. aureus was 26 cfu\/mL and the average num-ber of the microorganism in the presence of the product was 20 cfu\/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 1.30.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with C. albicans was 31cfu\/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 37 cfu\/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 0.84.The number of cfu of the challenge microorganism in the test with A. brasiliensis was 22cfu\/mL and the average number of the microorganism in the presence of the prod-uct was 24 cfu\/mL. The acceptability factor in this test is 0.92. The acceptability factors for all the used microorgan-isms were in the compatibility framework and they never exceed the value 2.In the test for absence of E. coli, there was good visible growth in Trypcase Soy broth after 24h and in Mac Conkey broth the growth was followed by a change of color of the medium. There was also presence of red non-mucous colo-nies on Mac Conkey agar after 24h.The growth promotion test of the used media showed that they are adequate for routine microbiological analysis.Conclusion Gastoguard chewable tablets do not have antimicrobi-al activity against the used test microorganisms.The method suitability test of the product revealed that the routine microbiological analysis should be performed with surface-spread method from 1:10 dilution for TAMC and TYMC and the method of direct inoculation in the test for absence of E. coli. The acceptability factors were in the frame provided by the current European Pharmacopeia and never exceeded the value 2.ReferencesClontz, L., 2009. Microbial limit and bioburden tests.

It is considered to be one of the most commonly consumed drugs with more than 80 percent of the world's population consuming caffeine daily. The Europeans are found to be the world's largest consumers of caffeine in-take of approximately 4.6 kg\/person\/year (Norton et al., 2014). The presence of the pharmaceutical residues in the environment has become the subject of growing concern in the past decade. Due to the continuous input that leads to the long-term adverse effects on the aquatic and terres-trial organisms, the special attention is being paid to their concentration levels in the aquatic environment. Caffeine can be found in traces in surface water. The main paths for caffeine to enter wastewater stream are either in urine or when caffeine-containing products are discharged through household pipelines or sewers. Determination of caffeine in surface water is an important task for environmental re-searches and analysis because it is found to be a good in-dicator for human sewage because of its relatively high concentrations in surface water and its unambiguous an-thropogenic origin. Other important usage of caffeine is as an analgesic adjuvant in drug formulations for the treat-ment of headache and pain related to postpartum, postop-erative, and dental surgery and it is therapeutically applied for the treatment of migraine in combination with other drugs such as aspirin, paracetamol and tramadol. Caffeine is claimed to enhance the efficacy of these drugs (Madhu-sudhan, 2013). The goals of this study were to develop and validate high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for caffeine determination in food, beverages, sur-face water and drugs which is simple and easy to perform. This method could have a widespread application in food, environmental and pharmaceutical sciences.Materials and methodsSamples for caffeine determination in food and bever-ages were purchased at the Serbian market, samples of sur-face water were collected in amber bottles from seven rep-resentative locations of the Danube River on the territory of Novi Sad, Serbia, and tablets of analgoantipyretics con-taining caffeine were purchased from pharmacies in the vi-cinity of Novi Sad, Serbia. Caffeine from all samples was separated by solid-phase extraction and analyzed by HPLC. The chromatography was using two-solvent isocratic elu-tion. The HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) model Agi-lent HP 1100 system equipped with an autosampler (Wald-bronn, Germany) was used. The analytical column was the Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, i.d., 5 um particle size). Mobile phase was water-THF (0.1% THF in water adjusted to pH 8 with 0.1 M NaOH) - acetonitrile (90:10) with a flow rate of 0.8 mL\/min. The HPLC mobile phase was prepared fresh daily and filtered through a 0.45 um nylon filter. Run time was 10 min, column temperature 25 degC and analytes were detected at 273 nm.Results and discussionThe linearity between caffeine concentrations and the response was tested for concentration levels ranging from (0.010-100) mg\/L. High value of coefficient of correlation r=1 showed an excellent correlation between concentra-tions and peak areas. Calculated limit of detection (LOD-3.3*s\/S) and quantification (LOQ-10*s\/S) were 0.007 mg\/L and 0.012 mg\/L, respectively. According to the re-S2 OP 61140Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 139 - 140 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsOral presentationscovery values of (98.33-100.22)% the method showed ac-ceptable accuracy. Repeatability of the method was test-ed by analyzing three different concentrations of caffeine standards in six repetitions. The relative standard devia-tions (RSD) ranged from 0.028% to 0.063% for retention time and from 0.015% to 0.65% for peak area showing ex-cellent repeatability."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-09T09:32:50.320021Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T12:33:44.058456Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":280,"annotations":[{"id":296,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":3842,"end":3854,"text":"antioxidants","labels":["Medicinal

were no interferences in the HPLC results by impurities or matrix in tested samples, which indicate that developed method, had very good se-lectivity.The results of caffeine content in food and beverag-es showed that it ranged 5.6-158 mg\/100 g in food sam-ples, 24.71-30.81 mg\/100 ml in commercial tea samples, 1328-3594 mg\/100 g in coffees and 9.69-30.79 mg\/100 ml in energy drinks. Also, obtained values in this study were consistent with the available manufacturer data. Analyz-ing surface water samples for caffeine, significant concen-trations were found at the sampling sites near the waste-water discharges. Mean caffeine concentrations for sum-mer, fall, winter and spring periods were 24.78 ng\/L, 26.83 ng\/L, 24.61 ng\/L, and 86.29 ng\/L, respectively. The high-est mean caffeine concentration was detected in samples collected in the spring period which is in an agreement with the literature (Fernandez et al., 2010). The caffeine content in combined non-narcotic analgoantipiretics varied from (96.48-100.74)% of the declared value. The require-ments of the British Pharmacopoeia include (95-105)% of active drug content. According to obtained data it can be concluded that all brands did meet this specification in the HPLC assay method.ConclusionIn this work a unique and simple to perform HPLC method was established for caffeine content determina-tion in food, beverages, surface water and analgoantipiret-ics. Obtained data for accuracy, repeatability, selectivity and robustness confirmed that the proposed method could be used for routine control of caffeine content in differ-ent mixtures. The results of food and beverages analysis showed that caffeine content was consistent with the avail-able manufacturer data and obtained data for combined commercial formulations of non-narcotic analgoantipiret-ics of all brands did meet specification of the British Phar-macopoeia for active drug content.

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that ex-ists in eight different forms, among them, a-tocopherol is the most active form in humans. Vitamin E is very popular cosmetic ingredient. It acts as antioxidant to protect cells against free radicals and reduces oxidative stress. Ultravio-let light and environmental pollutants are known initiators of free radicals and skin damage. Topical antioxidants have the potential to diminish the reactive oxygen species gen-erated from the UVA radiation. For that reason, there is an increasing interest in the incorporation of vitamins and an-tioxidants in skin care products (Lupo, 2001).The stability of the vitamin E in the cosmetic formu-lations and when applied to the skin is low. When exposed to UV light, it forms a-tocopheroxyl radicals that consume other antioxidants for recycling. For better stability, vita-min E is commonly used as a biologically non-active ester-ified form, such as tocopheryl acetate (Shapiro and Saliou, 2001). Vitamin E esters act as a pro-drug since they are hy-drolyzed to the active vitamin E (a-tocopherol) upon pen-etration into skin. However, there is conflicting evidence as to what extent this conversion actually takes place in the skin and many studies have shown that these substi-tutes have very low biological activity. While numerous topical skin care products claim to contain ''vitamin E'', these products may actually contain very different concen-trations and forms including active vitamin E, its several esters and many other derivatives (Thiele and Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage, 2007).The solid and emulsified cosmetic products must be carefully prepared for any of instrumental techniques which would be employed in the tocopherol analysis. The aim of this study was to develop an effective solid-phase extraction procedure for the HPLC determination of a-tocopheryl acetate, which could be important for assess-ment the content of this synthetic form of vitamin E in sun-screen lotions and creams. Materials and methodsMaterialsMethanol, ethanol and acetonitrile used in this work were of HPLC grade (J.T.Baker). a-tocopheryl acetate (TA) of analytical grade was obtained from Fluka (Fluka-Analytical BioChemika). Stock solution of 1.03 mg\/mL was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amounts of the a-tocopheryl acetate in absolute ethanol. Two sets of cali-bration standards were prepared by diluting aliquots of the stock solution.Cosmetic productsCommercial sunscreen products were purchased from a local cosmetic shop. Formulations under study were Pro-ducer 1-Sun Lotion SPF 30 and Producer 2-Sunscreen cream SPF 50. According to the product label, both formu-lations contained vitamin E only in the form of tocopheryl acetate and TA content was not exactly declared.Sample preparationA 0.5 g of the formulation was measured in 20 ml plas-tic volumetric container and 0.5 mL of 0.5% ascorbic acid was added. The emulsion was dissolved by vortex-mixing with 5 mL of ethanol. After centrifugation for 10 min, a 3 mL of the supernatant was pipetted and applied to the SPE column.SPE conditionsSolid phase extraction was performed on Chromabond C18ec cartridges (1ml\/100mg, Macherey-Nagel, GmbH, Duren, Germany), which was previously selected among S2 PP 62142Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 141 - 142 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsfive cartridges with different sorbent type. Cartridges were conditioned with 1mL of deionized water, followed by 1mL of methanol and 1mL of acetonitrile. After the sam-ple was aspirated through the cartridge, analyte elution was made by 2 x 1 mL of methanol.HPLC conditionsThe Agilent Technologies 1200 Series apparatus with DAD and FL detection was used for the analysis. Sepa-ration was performed on the Restek Ultra IBD C18 col-umn (150 mm x 3 mm, 3 mm). UV detector was set at 220 nm and 295 nm. Based on our previous work, 100% ace-tonitrile was selected as the optimal mobile phase (Sunaric et al., 2012). The column temperature was maintained at 40degC and the flow rate was kept at 0.45 ml\/min.Results and discussionTocopheryl acetate in extracted samples of the sun-screen formulations was identified by comparing the re-tention time of the observed chromatographic peak with that of the standard. Recovery of the solid-phase extrac-tion method was calculated by comparison of the TA peak area for extracted and non-extracted standard TA solution on five different cartridges. The obtained recovery value was higher than 85% for Chromabond C18ec, therefore this cartridge was selected for further analysis. Addition-ally, the cartridge selection was confirmed by extraction of the real samples supernatants obtained in sample prepa-ration procedure for the examined cosmetics. Even in this case, the highest chromatographic peak area of TA was ob-tained on Chromabond C18ec cartridge. The calibration curves for two concentration ranges, 0.2 mg\/mL - 2.0 mg\/mL and 0.1 mg\/mL - 1.0 mg\/mL with the correlation coefficients > 0.998 were constructed and applied for the determination of TA in the injected samples. Final tocopheryl acetate content found in the examined formulations was as follows: (200+-15) mg\/100g (0.2%) in Producer 1-Sun Lotion SPF 30 and (490+-20) mg\/100g (0.49%) in Producer 2-sunscreen cream SPF 50. These re-sults are in agreement with those given by other authors, that TA content is from 0.1% to 1% (Shapiro and Saliou, 2001; Thiele and Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage, 2007). As was expected, much higher content of TA was found in the formulation with a higher SPF level.ConclusionCosmetic formulations contain a high number of in-gredients and the analysis often requires extensive pre-treatments. A SPE method followed by HPLC determina-tion has been developed for the analysis of tocopheryl ace-tate in cosmetics. For the present experimental conditions, it can be concluded that the proposed extraction method was appropriate for the determination of TA in sunscreen lotion and cream. The extraction procedure was efficient, showing good accuracy and precision. Proposed analytical procedure for TA determination can be useful tool to know the amount of this synthetic form of vitamin E in cosmet-ic products.

Macedonia* szlatanovic@alkaloid.com.mkIntroductionNon-sterile drugs must satisfy the appropriate microbi-ological purity criteria which are included in monographs in pharmacopoeias. Pharmacopoeial studies are prepared specifically to ensure that the medicinal product is thera-peutically effective and safe for the patient.Caffetin Cold is a combined medicinal product, con-taining several active ingredients: paracetamol (500 mg), pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (30 mg), dextrometho-rphan hydrobromide (15 mg) and ascorbic acid (60 mg). Paracetamol is a pain reliever and reduces body tempera-ture. Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride decreases nasal con-gestion, allowing nasal and respiratory passages to open up. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide suppress cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation. Ascorbic acid (Vi-tamin C) fortifies the immune system (www.alkaloid.com.mk\/vademecum-step-2.nspx?LekTipId=64). The importance of determination of microbiological purity of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in solid forms comes from the fact that the final product must com-ply with the criteria for microbiological purity.Objective: Validation of analytical method for deter-mination of microbiological purity of paracetamol, pseu-doephedrine hydrochloride, dextromethorphan hydrobro-mide and ascorbic acid in the composition of Caffetin cold tablets. This method further should be used for routine de-termination of microbiological purity of APIs in Caffetin cold tablets. The method should be simple for manipula-tion and in compliance with the current edition of Europe-an Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur., 2013).Materials and methodsMaterialsStandard laboratory equipment was used. Buffered so-dium chloride peptone solution pH 7.0 was used as medi-um for dissolving of the sample and for making the dilu-tions of the culture suspensions.Ready to use nutrient media from BioMerieux(r) (69280 Marcy-l'Etoile-France) 90 mm Petri dishes of Trypcase Soy agar and Sabouraud Dextrose agar were used.Standard test microorganisms recommended by the current Ph.Eur. for the method suitability test: Escherichia Coli ATCC 8739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Bacillus spizizenii ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergil-lus brasiliensis ATCC 16404 were used for challenge test.MethodsSurface-spread method and determination of antimi-crobial activity of APIs in Caffetin cold tablets was used. The number of all test microorganisms applied in the chal-lenge tests was less than 100 cfu\/ml. Each application was made in duplicate and the temperature and time of incu-bation depended of the type of the medium. Trypcase Soy agar was incubated for five days at a temperature from 30-35 @C, Sabouraud Dextrose agar was incubated for 7 days at a temperature from 20-25 @C. After the incubation time, the relation between the number of the each test microor-ganism dissolved in buffered sodium chloride pepton solu-tion pH 7.0, and the number of that test microorganism in the presence of the product was calculated. When verifying the suitability of the plate-count meth-S2 PP 63144Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 143 - 144 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsod, a mean of any of the test organisms not differing by a factor greater than 2 must be obtained (Clontz, 2009; Ph.Eur. 2013; USP, 2014).Results and discussion Microbiological purity was determined with direct application on the nutrient medium with surface-spread method. Results for paracetamol (1:10) showed that acceptabil-ity factor is 0.93 when Escherichia coli was used, 1.35 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.97 for Staphylococcus aure-uss and 1.05 for Bacillus spizizenii. For Candida albicans the acceptability factor ranges from 0.93 to 1.07 and for Aspergillus brasiliensis from 1.06 to 1.13.Paracetamol does not have antimicrobial activity on the used test micro-organisms. Acceptability factor ranged within the compatibility framework and it never exceeded the value of 2.Results for pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (1:10) showed that there is no increase of colonies of Escherich-ia coli. Acceptability factor when Pseudomonas aerugino-sa was used is 29.33, for Staphylococcus aureus is 1.61, for Bacillus spizizenii is 6.00, for Candida albicans is 2.15 and for Aspergillus brasiliensis ranges from 1.30 to 2.93.Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride has an antimicrobial activity on the used test micro-organisms.

The reliability of the method is remarkably dependent upon the timely recognition of all factors that may generate erroneus resuts once the validated method is applied in practice. Therefore the scientific approach in course of LC-MS\/MS bioanalytical method development should involve risk analysis. The risk analysis denotes as-sessment of all critical steps (factors) that may affect the accuracy and ruggedness of the method. Matrix effect, me-tabolite interference, stability of the analyte and the selec-tion of an adequate regression model are identified as most common sources of method imprecision (Mulvana, 2010). Assessment of critical steps in bioanalytical method developmentMatrix effect (ME) is directly related to the sample clean-up procedure, thus selecting the optimal extraction procedure plays a crucial role for ensuring data quality in LC-MS\/MS bioanalysis (Chambers et al., 2007). Different types of extraction procedures, depending on the analyte, exhibit different extraction recoveries and ME. Therefore testing out various extraction procedures should become inevitable part of the contemporary bioanalytical meth-od development. The implementation of Quality by de-sign, as a new trend, enables shortening the time needed for the optimization of the sample preparation procedure. Until recently, the optimal extraction procedure was cho-sen only upon the extraction recovery. However, consider-ing the LC-MS\/MS analysis, the cleanliness of the extract, expressed through ME, obtained with different extraction procedures gains paramount importance. The EMA vali-dation guideline (EMA, 2011) recommends evaluation of the variability of the internal standard (IS)-normalized ME. However, it is more rational to assesses the degree of the absolute ME itself and not just the variability of the IS-nor-malized ME. This derives from the fact that the IS-normal-ized ME indicates that ME is consistent and not affected by the different lots of biological material. On the other hand, the absolute ME points out to the cleanliness of the ex-tracts (Nakov et al., 2015). Hence, it becomes evident that the selection of the sample preparation procedure should be based on the absolute ME and the extraction recovery should be put in second place, especially when problems related to the sensitivity of the method are not expected. The quantitative acceptance criteria applied in bioan-alytical validation guidelines (EMA, 2011; FDA, 2001) rely on data generated using quality control (QC) samples. However the QC samples do not contain phase I and II me-tabolites of the analyte of interest and therefore may be un-reliable model for real study samples. These metabolites are usually not stable and they can convert back to their parent drug in the mass spectrometer (in source back-con-version) and\/or during sample preparation (in vitro back-conversion), jeopardizing the accuracy of the bioanalyti-cal method (Wenkui et al., 2011). Therefore the assessment of the possibility of metabolite back-conversion prior the method validation becomes a crucial part of risk analysis. The first step includes assessment of the in source back-conversion through the verification of the chromatographic separation between the analyte and its metabolite. This is especially important for high throughput LC-MS\/MS anal-ysis, where chromatographic separation between the ana-lyte and the metabolite can be compromised, resulting in overestimated measurements. In case of this type of inter-S2 PP 64146Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 145 - 146 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis \/ Quality assurance \/ Regulatory affairsPoster presentationsference, optimization\/modification of the ion source pa-rameters and\/or the chromatographic conditions should be applied. The metabolite back-conversion could also occur during the different steps of the sample preparation pro-cess, so second step involves investigation whether the proposed extraction procedure leads to metabolite back-conversion. For that purpose the optimized extraction pro-cedure should be applied on samples containing only the metabolite standard and the amount of analyte generated by metabolite back-conversion is then computed. In case of unavailability of metabolite standards, stability exper-iments under different storage conditions using real sam-ples could be applied as well (Jemal et al., 2010). The investigation of the sample stability in course of method development helps to avoid stability related prob-lems that may latter appear during the validation and appli-cation of the method. Although various sources may affect the sample stability, the focus within this paper is placed on chiral interconversion. All chiral compounds may undergo in vitro R\/S conversion occurring at physiological pH and temperature or under extreme pH and elevated temperature (Briscoe and Hage, 2009). Therefore the assessment of the possibility of R\/S interconversion during the overall ana-lytical procedure should be an integral part for every enan-tioselective method development, thus allowing quantifi-cation of the extent of in vivo interconversion without bias.The selection of an adequate regression model is the basis for accurate and reproducible quantification over the whole concentration range (Rozet et al., 2011). Most bio-analytical methods usually have wide concentration range, so heteroscedasticity of the data may be expected. In the above instance weighted linear or quadratic regression models should be applied. The recommendation of the reg-ulatory agencies (EMA, 2011; FDA 2001) is that the sim-plest model that adequately describes data should be used and the selection of more complex model should be jus-tified. Therefore the use of statistical approach based on non-parametric statistical tests (Nakov et al., 2014; Singto-roj et al., 2006) during the selection of the regression mod-el will provide justification of the choice of the adequate regression model, and will enable accurate quantification in whole calibration range.SummaryThe implementation of risk analysis during the LC-MS\/MS bioanalytical method development is longer last-ing process compared to conventional method develop-ment. However the timely perceiving and assessment of the critical steps generates highly reliable bioanalytical methods and lowers the possibility of late discovery of un-expected problems than often lead to method re-optimiza-tion and revalidation.ReferencesBriscoe, C.J., Hage, D.S., 2009.

Macedonia* Hadzievam@yahoo.comIntroductionForced degradation studies provide data to support identification of possible degradants; degradation path-ways and intrinsic stability of the drug molecule and vali-dation of stability indicating analytical procedures (Singh and Bakshi, 2002). Although most of the literature de-fines the concept of forced degradation, they do not pro-vide detailed information about a forced degradation strat-egy (Klick et al., 2005) and the experimental conditions to conduct forced degradation are described in a general way (Singh and Bakshi, 2000) without description of the exact stress conditions to be applied. Generally, a trial and error approach is adopted to select the strength, temperature and time of exposure to achieve loss of active substance from 10-30% (ICH, 2003; Singh and Bakshi, 2000). Such approach involves consid-erable cost, time consumption and scientific expertise and there is high incidence of random results. Therefore a need for more systematic approach is recognized (Dolan, 2002).A contemporary approach in the field of forced degra-dation is to evaluate correlation of degradation parameters by applying the concept of design of experiment (DoE). In turn, this can help studying the combination of conditions where optimal enrichment of degradation products is ob-tained. The basic concept of factorial design is performing an experiment in which all the possible combinations of fac-tors and levels are investigated (Lundstedt et al., 1988).Literature review reveals the implementation of DoE and factorial design concepts for optimization of forced degradation conditions (Kurmi et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2013; Sonawane and Gide., 2011), but no report exists on application of DoE for simvastatin (SIM) as model drug.The aim of this study was to develop stability-indicat-ing LC-MS method for quantification of SIM and its im-purities, and also, an attempt was made to simplify forced degradation studies by adopting DoE concept.Materials and methodsSimvastatin (SIM) samples with Certificate of Suit-ability to the monographs of the European Pharmacopoia (CEP) were used. Simvastatin CRS and Simvastatin for peak identification were provided by the EDQM (Stras-bourg, France). All reagents used were of analytical grade.Experiments were made on Dionex UltiMate(tm) 3000 (Thermo Scientific), interfaced with mass spectrometer with an electrosparay-ionization source, operated in neg-ative mode. Mass parameters were optimized as follows: Ion source heater temperature was set at 350 degC; capillary temperature at 300 degC; capillary voltage was 10 V with collision energy 35 eV. The separation was performed on Poroshell 120 EC C18 (Agilent Technologies, USA), 50 x 3.0 mm, 2.7 mm, using buffer (10 mM ammonium format, pH 4.0) and acetonitrile as a mobile phase in a gradient mode. The column temperature was 40 degC. Flow rate was 0.5 mL\/min. Injection volume was 5 mL. UV detection was performed at 238 nm. SIM was subjected to stress under acidic, alkaline, ox-idative, thermal and photolytic conditions. Variables, cho-sen from previously conducted initial experiments were: time of exposure, temperature and stressor strength. The forced degradation experiments set-up on the basis of 2n full factorial design were performed and the obtained re-sults from LC-MS samples were analyzed by Design Ex-S2 PP 65148Maced. pharm.

The last one was dominant fraction in both species (65.25% in nuts of Pinus peuce and 58.65% in nuts of Pinus nigra), while the fraction of saturated and monounsaturat-ed fatty acids were present in smaller amount (7.15% and 26.10% in Pinus peuce and 14.70% and 25.56% in Pinus nigra, respectively). Total of 21 fatty acids were identified in the investigat-ed oil samples isolated from Pinus peuce nuts which rep-resented 97.79% of total oil. The most abundant fatty acids were linoleic acid (61.95%) which is classified as polyun-saturated o-6 fatty acid and oleic acid (24.98%) known as monounsaturated o-9 fatty acid. Palmitic acid (3.51%) was dominant in the class of saturated fatty acids. Similarly 28 fatty acids were identified in the oil samples isolated from nuts of Pinus nigra which represented 98.60% of total oil. Predominant fatty acids were the same linoleic (54.81%), oleic (22.80%) and palmitic acid (9.07%).In terms of data concerning the chemical composi-tion of oil isolated from pine nuts, only one study could be found regarding chemical composition of fatty oil isolated from black pine or Pinus nigra but still there is no avail-able published data about the composition of oil obtained from nuts of Pinus peuce or Macedonian pine. According Bagci and Karaagacli (2004), the oil isolated from nuts of black pine from Turkey contains linoleic (47.10%), oleic (17.80%) and palmitic acid (4.70%) as major constituents what correlates to our findings.ConclusionSummarizing the obtained results, it is evident that pine nuts collected from Macedonian species are rich in oil that contain significant amount of unsaturated o-6 as well as o-9 fatty acids thus could be considered as their potential source. Moreover further investigations of chem-ical composition should be made in order to provide more data for their possible medicinal, pharmaceutical or com-mercial utilization.ReferencesAlbert, C.M., Gaziano, J.M., Willett, W.C., Manson, J.E., 2002.

They are organic bases with aliphatic (putres-cine (Put), cadaverine (Cad), spermine (Spm), spermidine (Spd)), aromatic (tyramine (Tyr), phenylethylamine (Phe)) or heterocyclic (histamine (His), tryptamine (Trp)) struc-tures, can be classified as monoamines (Phe and Tyr), di-amines (His, Cad, Put) or such as volatile (Phe) and non-volatile (His, Cad, Put, Tyr, Spm, agmatine (Agm), Trp) biogenic amines. The main factors for formation of bio-genic amines in foods or fermented foods are following: the availability of free amino acids, the existence of de-carboxylase positive microorganisms and the presence of suitable pre-conditions that allow bacterial growth. Pres-ent in higher concentration in foods, poses health risk for sensitive peoples and are cause for a number of adverse ef-fects on human health such as rash, edema, headache, ur-ticaria, rhinitis, respiratory and digestive problems (Lade-ro et al., 2010). Some pharmacological effects of biogen-ic amines which have appropriate precursors are: liberates adrenaline and noradrenaline, stimulates both sensory and motor neurons, controls gastric acid secretion (histamine); increases the cardiac output, causes lacrimation and saliva-tion, increases respiration (tyramine); hypotension, depre-ciation of the wine aroma, potentiate the toxicity of other amines (putrescine and cadaverine); releases noradrenaline from the sympathetic nervous system, increases the blood pressure, causes migraine (phenylethylamine) etc. (EFSA, 2011; Shalabi, 1996). During wine production biogenic amines are already present in must obtained from sunny or rotten grape, be-cause from vineyard it is not possible to get grape which will be free of biogenic amines (Gloria et al., 1998). Addi-tionally the biogenic amines are accumulated during fer-mentation, from yeast (alcoholic fermentation) or bacteria (malolactic fermentation) or from other naturally present microorganisms. According to that, the wines where the amino acids are present are ideal environment for produc-tion of biogenic amines. The negative influence of biogen-ic amines on human health is the reason why the world with high velocity works on detection and determination the level of biogenic amines in different foods and wines. Although, different methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) are usually used for sep-aration and detection of biogenic amines in foods, ferment-ed foods and wines, the aim of this study is to develop and optimise the HPTLC method for qualitative and quantita-tive analysis of five biogenic amines in few red and white wines as an alternative method with several advantages. Materials and methodsSamples and chemicals: A total 12 wine samples (six red wines and six white wines) were collected from differ-ent winery and different aging period for determination of five biogenic amines. All chemicals and reagents were ana-S5 OP 220464Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 463 - 464 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationslytical grade. The hydrochloride forms of biogenic amines were used as standards and purchased from Sigma, Merck and VWR from Germany. Stock solution of His, Cad, Put, Phe and Tyr dissolved in 10% EtOH was prepared (500 ppm) and then for determination of calibration curve were prepared standard biogenic amines solutions: 0.1 mg\/L; 0.5 mg\/L; 1 mg\/L; 5 mg\/L; 10 mg\/L; 15 mg\/L in which 1.6 diaminohexan was added as internal standard. Preparation of wine samples for HPTLC analysis: liq-uid-liquid extraction of biogenic amines from wines was made by following procedure: 5 mL of wine sample was mixed with 1 mL 5 M NaOH and 2 mL 5 M Na2CO3. Af-ter that were added successively three times butanol (6 Ml + 3 mL + 3 ml), and upper butanol layer was segregate and mixed 4 min. with 5 mL 0.1 M HCl. Separated lower layer was derivatised as followed: 200 mL sample was mixed in plastic tubes (2 mL) with 400 mL Dansyl chloride (50 mg\/ 10 mL acetone) and 200 mL NaHCO3 (1.5 g\/ 10 mL H2O). Derivatisation was conducted at 60 degC on dark place for 60 min. and after that in sample was added 500 mL toluene. The above layer was separated and put in vials for automat-ic ATS4 application of the sample on the HPTLC plate. For elution of biogenic amines was used 10 mL mobile phase: Toluene:Chloroform:Trietylamine (10:6:5 by volume) and 0.5% Tween 80. Saturation time was 40 min. at room tem-perature, on dark, avoiding air movements. Overall elution time was 20 min. Instrumentation and conditions: HPTLC plates pre-coated with silica gel 60F254 (20 cm x 10 cm) from Merck (Germany) were used as the stationary phase. The samples were sprayed on the HPTLC plate (spray-on technique) with the help of a sample applicator AUTOMATIC TLC SAMPLER 4 (ATS4, CAMAG). The chromatogram was developed in horizontal developing chamber (CAMAG). Detection of components from developed HPTLC plates was made with fluorescence Vilber Lourmat detector. Ob-tained chromatograms were analyzed by software packag-es Infinity 15.01 and Tina.Results and discussionBiogenic amines are of increasing interest to the wine industry due to proposed regulatory issues. Although HPTLC technique is relatively simple, it is difficult to make directly separations of biogenic amines from com-plex wine matrix. For effectively separation of biogenic amines and solve the problem with effect of wine matrix into qualitative and quantitative routine analysis two deri-vatisation agents FMOC-CL (9-fluoroenylmethyl chloro-formate) and DAN-CL (dansyl chloride) were investigat-ed. After derivatisations and liquid-liquid extraction, bio-genic amines in wine samples were simultaneously anal-ysed by using CAMAG ATS 4 automatic sampler on pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 plate and Vilber Louromat fluo-rescent detector. After analysis of obtained results was con-cludes that second development derivatisation and modifi-cated liquid-liquid extraction protocol allowed effectively HPTLC separations and identification of biogenic amines in complex wine (red and white) matrix in concentration from 0.1 to 15 mg\/mL. Results of analysis shown that all red wine samples had higher level of biogenic amines than white wines. The validated method displayed excellent se-lectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and ro-bustness.ConclusionAccording to the known literature data, analysis of bio-genic amines by HPTLC method in wines has been used for the first time in Republic of Macedonia. The optimised HPTLC method compared with HPLC is less expensive for routine analyses of wines and enables reducing the use of organic solvents for derivatisation and for mobile phase, and provides an opportunity for determination of biogen-ic amines without higher interference with the compounds from the complex red or white wine matrix. In conclusion, the proposed HPTLC method is suitable for application in analysis of biogenic amines in differ-ent wines and could be considered as an alternative meth-od and an important tool in routine analysis of biogenic amines in wine.

Recently, there has been a considerable interest in extracts and essential oils from common culinary herbs, spices and aromatic plants with established antimicrobial and antioxidant potency. Among all, some representatives of the Lamiaceae family (oregano, marjoram, savory, sage, rosemary, thyme, basil ect. ), possessing high polyphenols content and vol-atile compounds, are often used to prevent different meet products from food born microorganisms or to stabilize fat and fat-containing foods."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-04-09T09:32:50.320021Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T12:33:49.749609Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
