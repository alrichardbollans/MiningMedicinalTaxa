and its side effects - an inquiry into the revival and renaissance of herbal medicine in Vietnam and Britain A thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy Ayo Wahlberg Department of Sociology London School of Economics and Political Science October 2006 2 3 For the Willamos & the Wahlbergs 4 Abstract Herbal medicine has experienced tangible revivals in both Vietnam and the United Kingdom since the mid-20th century, as reflected in sales of herbal medicinal products, numbers of users and the availability of training opportunities for aspiring herbalists. In both countries, this revival came on the back of more or less concerted official efforts to discourage and even ban the practice and use of herbal medicine, by colonial authorities (in Vietnam) or professional medical associations and regulatory bodies (in the UK). Utilising archaeological and genealogical methods as developed by Canguilhem, Foucault and others, this study seeks to account for these revivals by pursuing three particular lines of analysis. Firstly, by describing the formations of power-knowledge relations which have allowed Vietnamese and British herbal medicine to challenge biomedical monopolies in the latter half of the 20th century, it is argued that the ways in which 'quackery' is conceptualised and regulated against in both countries today, has undergone substantial transformations. Secondly, by identifying the techniques of truth making which either suggest or contest a superior efficacy (over placebo) for two particular herbal medicines in the treatment of depression (in the UK) and addiction (in Vietnam), the study demonstrates how the concept of 'efficacy' not only pertains to bio-physiological effects but also to the symbolic effects of the treatments in question. Finally, by asking what kind of 'life' herbal medicine is seen to be affecting, it is suggested that longevity has been joined by quality of life as a separate, yet inherently interlinked, therapeutic site. One of the key conclusions of the dissertation is, that the sub-disciplines of medical anthropology and sociology have played a crucial role in the 20th century births of 'traditional medicine' and 'complementary and alternative medicine' (as opposed to 'primitive' and 'fringe' medicine). Firstly, in diagnosing a 'crisis of modern medicine' by highlighting its dehumanising and toxifying effects, and secondly, in providing a theory of symbolic efficacy which could help explain the continued importance of what had in the past been written off as 'esoteric' or 'backward' healing practices. As a consequence, the study describes how an ongoing governmentalisation of human subjectivities has been a requisite side effect of modernisation in the recent revival and renaissance of herbal medicine in Vietnam and the United Kingdom. 5 Table of contents ABSTRACT .................................................................................................................... 4 LIST OF TABLES AND PLATES ............................................................................... 6 ACRONYMS................................................................................................................... 7 PREFACE - KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE......................................................... 8 1 MODERN FAILURES, TRADITIONAL REMEDIES........................................ 14 2 HISTORIES OF THE PRESENT........................................................................... 41 3 TRANSFORMATIONS IN QUACKERY ............................................................. 60 4 BIO-POLITICS AND THE NORMALISATION OF HERBAL MEDICINE... 87 5 ABOVE AND BEYOND SUPERSTITION ......................................................... 119 6 PATHWAYS TO PLAUSIBILITY....................................................................... 159 7 PETTY ENGINEERS OF MODERN LIFE ........................................................ 190 8 CONCLUSION ....................................................................................................... 223 REFERENCES ........................................................................................................... 237 6 List of tables and plates TABLE 1: CAM HIERARCHIES ..........................................................77 TABLE 2: LEVELS OF EVIDENCE ......................................................142 TABLE 3: RATING SCALES AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA USED IN SJW TRIALS .............................................................................153 TABLE 4: LOG FOR MONITORING EFFECTS OF ST.

Addiction? Yes... Vietnam... Yes... Well, that sounds pretty amazing, how much do we know? Really? Yes, let me call you back.\" A Master's student at the time, I was working a few days a week as an assistant in the information unit of a UN development agency in Copenhagen. My boss called me into her office where she had just finished the telephone conversation I had overheard. I was asked if I wanted to go to Hanoi a few months later in August. The Vietnamese government and the UN Development Programme were about to sign a three-year agreement in June of 1997 for a project on the \"International Scientific Development of the Anti-Drug Medication Heantos\". This was a story that would sell itself and the idea was to invite a group of European journalists to meet with the herbalists, scientists, doctors, UN officials and government representatives who had made the project possible. In the field of international development, most stories have to do with a one-way flow of resources, technology, know-how and humanitarian aid from industrialised to developing countries. Here was a story that turned the tables, a herbal remedy from a developing country which could potentially help the industrialised West with one of its fastest growing scourges, namely drug addiction. Before boarding my return flight back home from Hanoi, I bought myself a copy of the 22 September 1997 issue of Time magazine to help pass the hours. A full-page article in the health section was asking whether St. John's Wort, a folk remedy made from the plant hypericum perforatum, was \"Nature's Prozac?\". Apparently a string of recent clinical trials and pharmacological experiments in Germany were suggesting exactly that, with European sales skyrocketing as a result. I was otherwise busy finalising a degree in social science and international development studies in the middle of a field some thirty kilometres west of Copenhagen. The development studies course at Roskilde University was consistently overbooked. Most of us had travelled the world many times over, enough to realise how much of a luxury shoestring travel was when compared to the misery of the lives of the majority in many of the countries we had travelled in. We were convinced that the time was indeed ripe for alternative thinking in development studies as a new millennium approached; the World Bank, the WTO, the WHO and other international agencies had got it all wrong. An 9 alternative development was needed or even better, alternatives to development. Resistance, emancipation and the subaltern were the orders of the day. At the same time, a few of us at the institute began wondering how we could be so sure in our convictions. Post-lecture discussions turned into weekly 'grid sessions', as we called them. Rather than approach underdevelopment as some kind of ontological state or condition (of a continent, country or community), we learned to ask how we might approach it as a problem. What was it that made the alternative so compelling in attempts to address this problem? It was an approach I would pursue intensely in a Master's thesis about alternative development and one that I continue to pursue with equal intensity in the chapters that follow about alternative medicine. Since the summer of 1997, I have returned to Hanoi for extended stays on three occasions, twice to work as an intern at the Institute of Chemistry (in 1998 and 1999) where herbalists and scientists have been working to further develop Heantos for a decade now, and most recently in the fall of 2004 to do some follow-up fieldwork for this current study. During these stays I had the opportunity to travel throughout the north of Vietnam, meeting and learning from traditional practitioners, users of herbal medicine, doctors, government officials, UN agency representatives and local members of the Communist party in the many towns I visited. I had the chance to visit remote villages where opium cultivation and use have been a practice for centuries, to drive along the treacherously winding roads favoured by traffickers of opium resin, to talk with the addicts whose demographics neatly match the traffickers' routes, and to witness the treatment of addicts with Heantos and other forms of treatment in rehabilitation centres usually located on the fringes of towns and cities. In Hanoi, I spent many hours in the laboratories of the Institute of Chemistry, also visiting institutes of Drug Quality Control, Materia Medica and Traditional Medicine. In the United Kingdom (the second empirical site of my study), I have been closely following debates over complementary and alternative medicines since November 2000 when a research visit of mine to the British Library happened to coincide with the publishing of a controversial House of Lords Select Committee report on the growing use of CAM therapies in the UK (I recall an editorial in the Guardian asking \"Con or cure?\"). This task has been facilitated by my move to London in the fall of 2003 to commence work on this dissertation. Based in London, I have had the chance to explore the many different features of an urbanised herbal medicine which, in contrast to almost universal usage in 10 Vietnam, is very much a minority medicine. This has included forays into the Holland & Barrett outlets that stock natural remedies, bookshops that supply self-medicating herbal medicine users with guides and tips, and internet community sites where sufferers of depression exchange their experiences with St. John's Wort. I have also had the opportunity to speak with practitioners of western herbal medicine in the United Kingdom about ongoing efforts to professionalise their trade and to industrialise their remedies. As it happened, my interest in Heantos and St. John's Wort took me to numerous laboratories and clinics throughout Germany, a country that has long played a leading role in developing scientific techniques for the modernisation of herbal remedies. Over the past three years, I have spoken at length with the scientists and clinicians in these different sites about the challenges they face when working with herbal medicines. While in the laboratories I was given the opportunity to see the scientists at work as well as given layman's introductions to the technologies and equipment they use. In the clinics, I learned about the diagnostic criteria, clinical outcome measures, and patient selection processes used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of St. John's Wort and Heantos in the treatment of depression and addiction respectively. I also spent hours in medical libraries photocopying articles about the pharmacology of the plants I was interested in, as well as clinical trial results. I have done all this because I am interested in herbal medicine as a problem, or rather as a field of problematisation made up of bodies of knowledge and assemblages of practices. If herbal medicine is to be promoted, what are the problems to which it is seen as a solution? Conversely, if herbal medicine is to be discouraged, what are the problems that its practice and use are seen to engender? If we are in need of an alternative medicine then what are the failings of the medicine that it is an alternative to? If we are not in need of an alternative medicine then what should be done with those medicines which indeed are alternative? These are the kinds of questions which might be asked if we want to understand the conditions that make the alternative possible. Acknowledgments As always, the making of such a study as this could not have been possible without the support, guidance and expertise of a number of people. My sincere thanks to the Danish Research Agency for a three-year internationalisation grant which has not only allowed me 11 to devote my time entirely to this project, but also to do fieldwork in Vietnam and to attend international conferences; a privilege in today's world that is not lost on me. The grant has been ably administered by the Graduate School of International Development Studies at Roskilde University, my thanks to Professor Christian Lund and Inge Jensen for their support. Thanks also to the Central Research Fund of the University of London for a grant that has enabled me to carry out a number of field visits to laboratories and clinics in Germany. That I at all was given the chance to travel to Vietnam and to meet the many remarkable people that I have over the past years, I owe to Eva Arnvig and Dr. Lutz Baehr who I warmly thank for their support and encouragement over the years. In Hanoi, it is safe to say that without the generosity and assistance of Tran Khuong Dan, Professor Tran Van Sung, Nguyen Ba Chinh and Nguyen Quang, this study would never have happened. The passion and inventiveness of their work remains an inspiration in my own. Thanks also to the Institute of Chemistry of the National Academy of Natural Science and Technology for generously providing me with facilities and assistance, especially with translation, during my stays. I also owe my gratitude to Professor Hoang Bao Chau for patiently providing me with fascinating first-hand insight into the history of traditional medicine in Vietnam. And in further socio-historically contextualising my own contemporary analysis I have benefited greatly from the work of Laurence Monnais, Michele Thompson and Annick Guenel, all of whom generously shared their knowledge and insights with me. In Europe, my thanks go to herbalists Nina Nissen and Ned Reiter for taking the time to talk to me about the many challenges facing their profession in the UK. Thanks also to Professor Walter Muller of the Department of Pharmacology, University of Frankfurt for inviting me to his laboratories and educating me on the pharmacology of St. John's Wort. At the Leibniz Institute of Plant Bio-Chemistry in Halle, Professor Ludger Wessjohann and Dr. Katrin Franke were very patient and thorough in answering my many questions about their work on the phytochemistry of Heantos. My analysis has benefited considerably from what I learned. On the clinical side, I would like to express my appreciation to Professor Norbert Scherbaum of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the University of Duisburg-Essen. Thanks also to Dr. Klaus Linde of the Centre for Complementary Medicine Research at the Technical University of Munich for his insight into the complexities surrounding the clinical testing of complementary therapies. And on the 12 regulatory side, my thanks to Anna Dixon (LSE Social Policy) for sharing her extensive insight into the development of professional regulation for CAM practitioners, both nationally and internationally. In terms of academic training and inspiration, there are also a number of people whom I am greatly indebted to. As already alluded to, this project and the questions that it attempts to raise started some years ago for me. The community of students studying international development studies at Roskilde University in the late 1990s, especially the grid'ers among us, were a massive motivation for me in deciding to continue with my academic training. Fellow PhD candidate and philosopher Janne Mantykoski has also been an invaluable intellectual companion for almost two decades now. Since moving to London to study at the LSE, I have been especially fortunate to be able to share the challenges and highlights of postgraduate research with fellow PhD students at the BIOS Centre and at LSE Sociology. In particular, I would like to thank Chris Hamilton, Annette Jensen, David Reubi, Dr. Scott Vrecko, Linsey McGoey, Megan Clinch, Kerstin Klein, John MacArtney, Btihaj Ajana, Lamprini Kaftantzi and Mathew Kabatoff for always constructive engagement and for so many delicious cakes. I would also like to thank Dr. Carlos Novas, Dr. Filippa Lentzos and Dr. Michael Barr for sharing their insight and thoughts along the way, especially Carlos and Filippa for comments and valuable help in the final working through of the dissertation. As a part of my Danish internationalisation grant I have had the fantastic fortune of receiving support from two places, my grant-administering institution in Denmark, Roskilde University and the London School of Economics where I have been enrolled. A warm thanks to my supervisor of many years in Denmark, Dr. Afonso Moreira for guidance, countless brainstorming sessions, and for always challenging me when I thought I had reached my limits. In London, a very special thanks to my supervisor Professor Nikolas Rose for welcoming me to the LSE and helping me to develop academically in such an amazing environment as BIOS. This dissertation could not have come into being without his intellectual guidance and support. It has been a privilege. 13 Family and friends who are by now spread across the world's continents, though happily only cyber-seconds away, have and continue to be a constant source of inspiration and encouragement. And finally, yet in so many, many ways above all, thank you to Helle and Mathias. 14 1 Modern failures, traditional remedies When a working party put together by the British Medical Association in 1983 reported on some of the main causes they had identified to explain a growing interest in alternative therapies, their conclusions were rather familiar: Relatively few years ago, when little therapeutic help could be offered, the physician devoted much time to counsel and to support the patient. Now therapeutic intervention, often life-saving, is quickly and skilfully available, and has become so commonplace that the swiftness of the changes is forgotten and the significance of the consequences passes unnoticed. One of the consequences of the changed nature of the relation of the doctor to the patient is that the current pressures and the technical demands of modern medicine do not allow him the opportunities formerly devoted to counselling, sympathetic contact and support... An additional consequence of the advances in medicine in the latter part of this century is the impact of these far-reaching changes on the nature of the doctor's training, with increasing emphasis on the scientific aspects of the curriculum, and a growth of specialisation... An additional aspect should be mentioned. The growth and dependence on new diagnostic aids of all kinds, the nature of the haematological and pathological services, and their matter-of-fact and impersonal nature are identified by the patient, the physician and the medical technologist alike as an intrusion juxtaposed between patient and physician... Yet this new orientation and attitude of doctors trained in the last 30 years has not been matched in the provision of support services to meet the novel and still-growing demand from the modern patient for communication, information and instruction. (British Medical Association. Board of Science and Education. 1986: 3-4) It is no secret that modernity has of late been in for somewhat of a scolding. The processes of industrialisation, commodification, technologisation, differentiation, rationalisation, modernisation, professionalisation, and bureaucratisation that are considered defining of the modern era have been variously diagnosed as alienating, disenchanting, ossifying, repressing, and dehumanising in their effects."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-03-20T10:52:13.998647Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T16:45:52.205725Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":273,"annotations":[{"id":289,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":1692,"end":1706,"text":"anti-influenza","labels":["Medicinal

the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, the government's efforts to encourage use of traditional medicine were expanded to the rest of the country, with the Ministry of Health issuing a decree requiring every district to have a department or institute that provided traditional medical treatment. It is estimated that 40-50% of all medical treatment being provided at the time was based on traditional medicine, with herbal medicine and acupuncture being the most popular therapies (Hoang 2004; Huu and Borton 2003). However, when the Vietnamese government embarked on a series of economic reforms starting in 1986 it had a marked impact on the provision and practice of traditional medicine with \"many herbal pharmacists and acupuncturists abandon[ing] their practices\" (Huu and Borton 2003: 87), mainly because the subsidies they had been receiving from health authorities were rescinded. At the same time, modern drugs were becoming more freely available with trade embargos gradually being lifted. As a result, traditional medicine experienced a period of decline that lasted until about 1992. Since then, however, the Ministry of Health has led an active campaign to \"revitalise\" or \"revive\" traditional medicine (this being the third and final part of the post-independence period). Important components of this \"revival\" campaign have been the \"Drugs at Home\" and \"Doctor at Home\" programmes of the Ministry of Health (see World Bank 1993). Picking up where they had left off, the \"Drugs at Home\" programme was designed to once again encourage communal clinics as well as villagers to grow thirty-five species of 116 essential medicinal plants in their gardens known for their anti-influenza, anti-inflammatory, anti-dysenteric, anti-rheumatic, anti-tussive, anti-diarrhoeic and emmenagogic properties.62 Each commune is now encouraged to reserve more than half a hectare for such cultivation; the goal is to have about 40% of patients treated with herbal remedies at communal clinics (Bui 1999: 30-31). As part of the \"Doctor at Home\" programme, a book entitled \"Herbal Medicines for Families\" has been prepared providing users with instructions on how to prepare remedies for some of their most common ailments, including diarrhoea, whooping cough, allergies, hormonal imbalance and colitis (see Bui 1999; World Bank 1993). This renewed revitalization effort, spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and involving a number of trained activists, has been described as a programme to \"re-educate the local people on the use of herbal remedies and [to] encourage them to grow and use medicinal plants\" (Huu and Borton 2003: 67). And so, while the aim of normalisation efforts in the United Kingdom (where scepticism as to the efficacy of herbal medicine is still widespread) has been one of instilling and cultivating a kind of herbal pharmacovigilance in consumers of herbal medicines, in Vietnam (where the efficacy of herbal medicines is more or less taken for granted and they are used pretty much universally) it has much more been about \"re-educating\" the people about the virtues of herbal medicine as a means of instilling a self-sufficient approach to looking after their own health, among other things by cultivating essential medicinal plants in their own gardens. The extent of self-medication with herbal medicines is both recognised, and in the case of Vietnam, encouraged albeit with the relatively new caveat that this self-use be \"appropriate\". That is to say, public use of herbal medicine is to be promoted insofar as it contributes to the overall promotion of health and well-being. Moreover, as consumers are increasingly encouraged to take an active part in ensuring their own health, the proper use of herbal medicine through \"informed choice\" now stands as one option among many others. Such proper use is, however, not to be taken for granted, but is rather encouraged through a range of awareness raising and educational efforts that aim to responsibilise and\/or activate users of herbal medicines.63 62 These essential medicinal plants had been identified during the course of the various botanising missions carried out by scientists and herbalists described earlier. 63 See chapter 7 for further discussion on how herbal medicine use has been intervened upon in recent decades. 117 Conclusion As already forewarned, for all its discussion of regulatory initiatives, governmental herbal medicine policies, consumer awareness programmes and herbal practitioner association activities, this chapter cannot be said to have provided an exhaustive or representative history of the regulation of herbal medicine in Vietnam and the UK. Nor has my intention been to evaluate the benefits or disadvantages associated with different regulatory regimes, as has perhaps otherwise been customary in policy-oriented research. Instead, what I have done in this chapter is trace the emerging contours of the contemporary problem of herbal medicine in the Vietnamese and UK contexts over the past decades, showing where differences and overlaps have appeared. Rather than approach the field of herbal medicine in terms of marginalisation or coercion, I have chosen to analyse it as a field of problematisation that has opened up debates about who should be allowed to practice herbal medicine, what herbal products should be allowed on to the market, and what patients should do to get the best and safest possible herbal treatment. These problematisations have in turn both relied on and made available a host of new possibilities for action, where producers, practitioners and users are concerned. Herbal practitioners are to be competent, responsible and accountable, which requires: adhering to new codes of conduct; attendance to lifelong learning; refraining from 'quacking' one's wares and abilities; maintenance of skills; registration with local health authorities or practitioner associations; utilisation of quality-controlled herbal remedies; and recognition of the limitations of one's healing abilities. Producers of herbal medicinal products are to follow Good Manufacturing Principles; ensure that they have a sustainable, pesticide-free supply of fresh herbs; and refrain from lacing their products with any 'foreign' substances. And, on their part, herbal medicine users\/patients are to act responsibly and vigilantly by making informed choices about the products and practitioners they choose; they should report any false or misleading claims that might be made; in the United Kingdom, they should preferably consult with their GPs before taking any herbal medicines; and in Vietnam, they are to take an active part in growing and harvesting essential herbal medicinal plants, and to learn how to prepare home remedies for common ailments. In sum, promoting and protecting the public health in the field of herbal medicine today requires \"appropriate\", \"informed\" and \"safe\" use of it by active, vigilant and responsible subjects that are enabled to tell the competent from the incompetent herbal practitioner and 118 protected from counterfeit or contaminated herbal remedies. It requires the \"responsible\" and \"ethical\" practice of herbal medicine by \"qualified\" practitioners, who adhere to strict codes of conduct and commitments to continued professional development. What is more, a whole industry is emerging around the practices of assurance that are increasingly demanded of the manufacturers and practitioners of herbal medicines - involving quality controls, clinical trials, training programmes, refresher courses and codes of conduct. The key debates in herbal medicine today are not over whether it should be regulated and controlled (as opposed to marginalised or banned), but rather over how such practices of assurance should be organised so as best to preserve the 'real value' of herbal medicine while at the same time protecting the public from dangerous practitioners and products. Some argue that the kind of regulatory efforts I have been describing in this chapter may in fact end up disenchanting, ossifying or diluting herbal medicine,64 while others are convinced that they have improved its quality, safety and efficacy, a debate we will be returning to throughout the following chapters. For now it is important to understand that the transformation of herbal medicine, from fringe to alternative in the UK and from primitive to traditional in Vietnam, has opened up a new field of problematisation in terms of competency, safety and responsibility which is already being played out through a number of concrete strategies of normalisation. This is what I have called a bio-politicisation of herbal medicine as the objective has been to devise ways of ensuring that herbal medicine - its production, practice and use - promotes rather than harms the health of populations and individuals in both countries. Let us now turn our attention to a concept that I have yet to deal with at length, namely efficacy. 64 For example, herbalist Peter Jackson-Main argues that: \"By defining herbal medicine as a graduate entry profession, there is a danger that the emphasis on academic learning may eclipse traditional values and practices. The introduction and consolidation of herbal medicine in universities is a vital step in the fight for recognition, and a coming of age of Western herbal medicine. At the same time, it echoes the process of exclusive professionalisation that characterised the medical profession's assault on the lay community of practitioners in the nineteenth century\" (2005: 97). Saks makes a similar point suggesting that one of the dangers of professionalisation is \"the way in which such enclaves of exclusionary social closure can become pockets of self-interested protectionism that retard progress, despite the positive ideologies of professional bodies\" (2003: 152). 119 5 Above and beyond superstition In the early part of the 1980s, Tran Khuong Dan set off northward from Ho Chi Minh City on a journey that would take him the length of Vietnam's 2,000 or so kilometres. Trained as a traditional herbalist by his father, Dan's travels were to be of a medically edifying nature. For after having witnessed the miserable effects opium addiction was having on individuals and communities first hand in his own neighbourhood, Tran Khuong Dan became determined to find a remedy that could help rid opium-dependent users of their addiction. And very much in tune with national efforts to revive traditional medicine, Dan felt that the experiences and knowledge that traditional herbalists throughout the country had had with opium dependency was a good place to start. His travels would therefore take him off the beaten track, to rural communes and villages where opium cultivation and use had been a part of daily life for centuries. In these villages, Dan sought out traditional herbalists to discuss and exchange ideas on treating opium dependency, only to discover that in most cases local herbal remedies included some quantity of opium aimed at appeasing withdrawal symptoms. Having reached the north of Vietnam towards the end of the 1980s, Dan settled down to digest and organise the experiences and knowledge he had amassed during his travels. He also began scouring traditional Chinese and modern medical texts to learn as much as he could about addiction as well as methods of treatment. It was from this broad base of knowledge, spanning the traditional practices of village herbalists and the theoretical underpinnings of Sino-Vietnamese traditional medicine, that Dan began developing a herbal remedy for addiction. His aim was to home in on a range of plants that could address what he had come to see as the key problems of addiction: an imbalance in the bodies of the addicts, a continuous shortage of drugs in the brain, and a set of sixteen different withdrawal symptoms that made 'cold turkey' detoxification a nightmare. From Sino-Vietnamese theories of healing, Dan knew that addiction could be understood in terms of a Yin-Yang imbalance with addicts suffering from extreme Yin. At the same time, from his own observations in Ho Chi Minh City and during his travels, Dan had become convinced that each of the sixteen withdrawal symptoms that manifest themselves during the first 72 hours of detoxification had to be understood and medicinally addressed in their specificities, albeit as complementary parts of a holistic treatment. This conviction was 120 further corroborated by two years of successive self-inflicted addiction withdrawals, during which Dan self-experimented with various herbs and mixtures.65 And so finally, in September 1990, Tran Khuong Dan approached local health authorities with a complex thirteen-plant herbal syrup, which he was convinced could cure addicts of their addiction by appeasing withdrawal symptoms, restoring balance and, importantly, eliminating cravings. Only a few months later, a memorandum from Minister of Health Pham Song was sent to Prime Minister Do Muoi to inform him that \"the Ministry of Health has received a request for a license to manufacture and distribute the medication TKD [later renamed Heantos]... It has been determined that this medication for the cure of drug addiction has an important potential for the social economy and thus the Ministry of Health has granted a license to proceed with trials\" (Vietnam. Ministry of Health. 1991). Six years later, in 1996, Dan joined forces with the Institute of Chemistry in Hanoi to further develop his remedy, arguing: while traditional medicine was developed over thousands of years, certain aspects still need to be explained scientifically. And so, it tends to be regarded as superstition. Using science to throw light on traditional medicine is imperative. (cited in Impact 2000) Unbeknownst to Tran Khuong Dan, during the same decade that Heantos was being developed in Vietnam, a plant long known for its medicinal value in Europe was about to be 'rediscovered', kicking off a chain of events that would eventually turn St. John's Wort (hypericum perforatum) into one of the first herbal blockbusters. Records of the medicinal uses of St. John's Wort date back to Theophrastus (373-287 BC), Pliny (23-79 AD) and Dioscordes (40-90 AD) who recommended it for burns, snakebites and as a diuretic. But it was not until the 16th century that the first references to its use as an \"arnica for the nerves\" can be found, when Paracelsus (1493-1541) recommended it for not just wounds and parasites, but also for what he called 'phantasmata' (see Muller 2005). A century later, in 1630, Italian iatrochemist Angelo Sala reported that: St. John's Wort has a curious, excellent reputation for the treatment of illnesses of the imagination... and for the treatment of melancholia, anxiety 65 This is how Tran Khuong Dan has recounted the story of how he developed Heantos on numerous occasions, see for example, Impact (2000) or the 24 November 1997 issue of Time magazine (Larimer 1997). 121 and disturbances of understanding... With the same power it works against the symptoms caused by witches. (cited in Rosenthal 1998: 197) During the so-called 'golden age of quackery' of the 17th to 19th centuries (Holbrook 1959; Porter 1989), the effectiveness of St. John's Wort in treating \"illnesses of the imagination\" was accounted for in a few different ways. Ascribing to astrological explanations as well as to the doctrine of signatures, Nicholas Culpeper classed the very yellow-flowering St. John's Wort \"under the celestial sign Leo, and the dominion of the Sun\" in his English Physitian (1652), while Robert John Thornton explained in his Family Herbal (1814) how \"formerly it was supposed, and not without reason, that madmen were possessed of the devil, and this plant was found so successful in that disorder, that it had the title Fuga daemonum, as curing demoniacs\" (cited in Rosenthal 1998: 202). Indeed, Rosenthal has shown how accounts of the powers of St. John's Wort to ward off spirits, chase away the devil, or overcome witchcraft were \"rampant throughout Europe and the British Isles\" during these centuries (1998: 203). But it would not be long before, as we saw in previous chapters, such explanations would come to be dismissed as the superstitions and old wives' tales of backward rural populations, which probably also explains the relative medicinal anonymity of St. John's Wort during the ensuing 'golden age of biomedicine'. In fact, it would not reappear until the early 1980s,66 when a small manufacturer of herbal remedies, Lichtwer Pharma, commissioned a series of clinical trials to test the efficacy of St. John's Wort extract in the treatment of an emerging epidemic of fast-paced modern life: depression. This chapter is about the concept of efficacy. What does it entail to claim that an alternative or traditional remedy is efficacious? What kinds of claims to truth are invoked in doing so? And crucially, how does one go about validating efficacy claims? In the following, we will take a closer look at some of the conditions which have allowed for Heantos and St. John's Wort to rank among the most prominent herbal remedies in Vietnam and the United Kingdom in recent years. Importantly, as we will see, this has relied on an active effort to dismiss suggestions that these remedies are just another set of backward, superstitious concoctions, or to put it in more updated terms, that they have a therapeutic effect that is above and beyond placebo. In both cases, confirming clinical efficacy has taken priority 66 Dr. K. Daniel of Germany did carry out the first controlled trials on patients suffering from mild depression in the late 1930s, but his research appears to have become lost as war broke out in Europe (see Rosenthal 1998: 200-2). 122 over determining the exact (biological) mechanism of action that might be responsible for this effect, although as we will be seeing in the following chapter, this latter work has also begun in earnest. Yet, while randomised controlled trials have played a crucial role in attempts to validate the specific (biological) verum effects (what might be termed the bio-efficacy) of Heantos and St. John's Wort, I will argue that by virtue of their status as traditional and alternative remedies, confirming clinical efficacy has been in part facilitated by an early 20th century anthropological recasting of evolutionarily 'primitive' and 'immature' medical practices into highly rational, sophisticated and coherent systems of healing. As such, there are three particular conceptual recasts, that I will be describing in this chapter and which I will demonstrate have been instrumental in the framing of recent efforts to validate the efficacy of Heantos and St. John's Wort. The first relates to 20th century ethnographic accounts of how 'symbolic cognitive frameworks' - which these two herbal remedies and the healing systems they invoke are certainly seen to provide patients with - are crucial in helping people cope with their diseases\/illnesses. By showing how what were once considered the immature superstitions of easily suggestible and backward rural populations - whether in Vietnam or the United Kingdom - were recast into coherent cognitive frameworks, I will argue that pioneer medical anthropology studies have been instrumental in positing a very concrete symbolic efficacy for all therapies, remedies and healing encounters, regardless of whether they are considered primitive, modern, traditional or alternative."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-03-20T10:52:13.998647Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T14:03:26.879469Z","inner_id":3,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":274,"annotations":[{"id":290,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":332,"end":346,"text":"drug

set times, the clinician visited each trial participant to rate the severity of each symptom, giving a maximum of three marks for each symptom. The tabulation of this data in the different patients over the set, 10-day period could then provide a visual presentation of the performance of Heantos in \"alleviating withdrawal from drug addiction\", especially when compared against a non-compliant group of trial subjects (as happened in the first trial), a group receiving a different treatment (as happened in the second controlled trial), or against a group receiving placebo (as is planned to happen in the University of Essen trials). As the two first controlled trials were only ten days in length, the scientific committee could not conclude anything about the efficacy of Heantos in \"curing\" addiction by eliminating cravings in the long-term, which has been one of its claims. Instead they were limited to commenting on the short-term efficacy of Heantos in alleviating withdrawal symptoms (including craving) during a ten-day detoxification treatment. Conclusions from the first controlled trial which compared the detoxification of 23 patients receiving Heantos to that of a group of five non-compliant patients, were that: in general, we found that Heantos supports the alleviation of withdrawal from drug addiction. The medicine has effects that reduce cravings, reduce paraesthesia, reduce symptoms of digestive disorder, recover the patients' sleep habits and that help the patients recover their health rapidly as well as clear their minds. (Vietnam. Institute of Chemistry. 1999: 43) Conclusions from the second controlled trial were that: ATK [neuroleptic] therapy is more efficacious than Heantos in alleviating paraesthesia and insomnia whereas symptoms of diarrhoea and mydriasis were minor and appeared with lower frequency in patients treated with Heantos. The efficacy of Heantos is weaker than ATK therapy in alleviating drug craving. However, the overall health of patients treated with Heantos recovered more rapidly than of those treated with ATK (Vietnam. Central Psychiatric Hospital. 2002: 50-1) At the same time, another confounding factor for the scientific committee has been an ongoing and parallel effort to improve extraction methods in the production of Heantos (see 145 chapter 6). While the very first 'quasi-experimental' studies were carried out with Heantos in its original liquid-syrup form, and the first two controlled trials were carried out with the first-ever batch of Heantos capsules produced at the Institute of Chemistry in April 1998 following two years of collaboration between Tran Khuong Dan and plant chemists, by the time the controlled trials had been completed a new \"improved\" batch had been produced in October of 2001 following further phytochemical extraction and isolation work on the thirteen different plants that make up Heantos. Nonetheless, notwithstanding these systematic and formalised efforts by an appointed national scientific committee to evaluate the short-term efficacy of Heantos in the alleviation of withdrawal from opiate addiction, scepticism has persisted both outside of the Asian region as well as within Vietnam. For example, local media in Hanoi reported the alleged deaths of up to six patients after treatment with Heantos in 1998, including suggestions by other herbalists (who it should be pointed out promoted rival detoxification remedies) that Tran Khuong Dan was an \"impostor\" (see Boggan 1998). The WHO, while suggesting that preliminary Vietnamese clinical research results \"indicate the potential of Heantos\" has stressed that \"international clinical testing\" must be a crucial component of \"a rigorous process of scientific evaluation\" (WHO 2000a). Another UN agency, the UN Drug Control Programme, has argued that \"there is insufficient information available... [and that] there does not appear to be any evidence that Heantos is more effective than any other products available for a similar 'treatment'\" (UNDCP 2001). And finally, a recent article on Heantos in Nature suggested that international testing was necessary as \"clinical research is weak in Vietnam\" (Aldhous 2005: 569). For these kinds of reasons, the UN-funded project included from its beginning in 1996 a parallel drive to gain international recognition of the efficacy of Heantos via three specific routes: the treatment of a handful of foreign nationals to gain testimonial evidence of its efficacy on 'non-Vietnamese', the invitation of an international expert group of doctors and clinicians to witness the treatment of addicts with Heantos in Vietnam, and, finally, preparation of a double blind randomised controlled trial to be carried out in Germany (the first planned trial outside of Vietnam). In the late 1990s, foreign nationals from Switzerland, Denmark, USA and Ghana were given permission to follow a treatment course of Heantos \"on an exceptional basis\", as prescribed by inventor Tran Khuong Dan and closely monitored by both Vietnamese and accompanying medical doctors (UNOPS 1998b). The process was relatively similar in each 146 case, with international doctors responsible for preparing case histories on each subject that had been voluntarily selected in their country of origin, accompanying subjects to monitor their treatment with Heantos in Vietnam, reporting on what they had observed and, in a number of cases, securing testimonials from the treated subjects as well.79 While these treatments were not designed as part of the formalised validation process, one of the more or less explicit rationales for securing these testimonials was to demonstrate that Heantos had an efficacy that was not somehow socio-culturally esoteric to Vietnam but rather 'universal' in a \"diversity of cultural situations\" (UNOPS 1998a: 8). As we saw earlier, both the inventor of Heantos and his scientist partners were well aware of biomedical scepticism towards traditional medicine. In May 1999, five doctors and clinicians with experience in the treatment of drug addicts from America, Denmark, Sweden and Norway were invited by the Institute of Chemistry in Hanoi to visit Vietnam in order to \"assess the utilisation and efficacy of Heantos\" (Baehr, et al. 1999). The goal of this mission was to obtain the expert opinions of 'western' doctors and clinicians on the potential of Heantos as an addiction treatment, or put in another way, to secure 'level IV evidence' (see Table 2) on the efficacy of Heantos. During its six days in Hanoi, the international group of experts was given the opportunity to follow the detoxification of nine Vietnamese addicts and five western addicts. The addicts were given a treatment of Heantos according to a regimen provided by inventor Tran Khuong Dan, which was divided into two phases, a 72-hour detoxification followed by three to four days to \"restore the health condition of the detoxed addict\" (Baehr, et al. 1999: appendix 2). While underlining the inherent limitations of such short observations, the expert group did conclude that based on their knowledge of addiction treatment \"Heantos appears to be a better agent for detoxification than the standard methods used in... the western world\", and 79 A typical testimonial reads: \"I flew out to Hanoi... and took the Heantos treatment. Since then I have not touched any drugs. The detox was good. It took away all the physical pain right from the first day. It also got rid of all the mental desire. I no longer want to take drugs. I did not do anything special for this to happen. I just took Heantos. The treatment is so perfect that the first night I slept 8 hours and then got up and went out for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It was like that for the rest of the treatment. I do understand that after reading my words you must be thinking that I am still on drugs or completely off my trolley. But I can assure you that this treatment really works. I actually am not going to go on about how wonderful it is but let me say this, that with the quantities of cocaine, heroin, and 90 milligrams of methadone I was using, I would of need at least 6 months to get a good nights sleep, not mentioning the other BS that goes along with it. I think in the past 2 months I must of had 2 sleepless nights. I don't really think I should complain about that or consider that a withdrawal symptom but, I had to complain about something or it just wouldn't be me. I still wonder how those small capsules could do such a job. Heantos is actually the drug addicts dream come true, a pain free detox in 4 days and no more cravings to use again\" (from http:\/\/hometown.aol.com\/heanto\/, accessed on 9 November 2005). 147 Plate 1 Clinical outcome measures Table and graph of modified Himmelsbach withdrawal scale tracking withdrawal symptoms of a non-compliant 'control' group (Nhom I) compared with two groups (Nhom II & Nhom III) following separate regimens of Heantos treatment over ten days (Vietnam.

Finally, following a similar visit to Vietnam by German clinicians from the University of Essen later in the same year, the regional government of Nord-Rhein Westfalen agreed to fund a double-blind randomised controlled trial in Essen at the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy. The trial, which is pending final authorisation from German health officials,80 has been designed as a double-blind randomised controlled trial with the efficacy of Heantos in treating withdrawal compared to a placebo arm. As we have seen, the efforts to validate the efficacy of Heantos can be understood as a series of more or less coherent attempts to ascend the WHO's levels-of-evidence hierarchy, especially in the face of scientific scepticism towards traditional medicine on the one hand, but also towards the capacity of Vietnamese scientists to carry out \"rigorous\" research on the other. At the same time, assessments of Heantos' efficacy in the alleviation of withdrawal symptoms have relied on standardised diagnostic admissions criteria to identify relevant trial subjects, as well as standardised clinical outcome measures which allow for the quantification and tabulation of clinical trial results. While the trial results to have come out of Vietnam so far have on the whole been positive, this has not as yet translated into the \"international recognition\" that clinical testing outside of Vietnam is considered requisite by, for example, the WHO and UNDCP, who have at best been sceptical of the capacity of Vietnamese scientists to carry out \"rigorous\" clinical trials. Moreover, as we will be seeing, the ongoing effort to scientifically develop Heantos that has resulted in frequent formula changes has opened up the question of just what is being tested for efficacy: a particular active ingredient, a whole plant extract, many different whole plant extracts combined in a specific (yet changing) way, or an entire 'holistic' way of treating addiction which includes the use of Heantos? Let us now turn to the past twenty years worth of efforts to validate the efficacy of St. John's Wort in the treatment of depression. Templates of healing - St. John's Wort and the psychometrics of depression While Heantos has been subject to relatively few clinical trials to date, the same cannot be said of St. John's Wort. In fact, together with garlic (allium sativum) and ginkgo (ginkgo biloba), St. John's Wort (hypericum perforatum) has become one of the most clinically 80 This was the status in October 2006. 150 studied plants in the world.81 As described in the introduction to this chapter, although there had been some interest in the anti-depressant action of St. John's Wort throughout the 20th century, the vast majority of its clinical testing has taken place in the past two decades. And not so surprisingly, it was in Germany that this late 20th century intensification of clinical studies began,82 eventually spreading to America and Europe. In December 1984, the German Commission E83 published the first of 360 medicinal herb monographs based on extensive bibliographic reviews. Among these was a monograph for the well-known German folk remedy plant johanniskraut. While there was little clinical data available at the time on St. John's Wort, an otherwise long bibliographic reference trail led the 24-person Commission (made up of physicians, pharmacists, non-biomedical practitioners, pharmacologists, toxicologists and biostatisticians) to list \"psychovegetative disturbances, depressive moods, anxiety and\/or nervous unrest\" as possible treatment uses for it, as well as to note that \"a mild antidepressant action of the herb and its preparations has been observed and reported by numerous physicians\" (Heilpflanzen-Welt 2005). As it happened, this positive monograph would be an important catalyst for a spate of clinical trials in the ensuing ten years, a good part of which were funded by herbal medicine manufacturer Lichtwer Pharma in Germany (see Muller 2005). By the mid 1990s, at least 37 clinical trials had been carried out on extracts of hypericum, enough for Linde et al. (1996) to carry out the first meta-analysis of clinical trials that had compared the efficacy of St. John's Wort in the treatment of depression against either placebo or standard antidepressant treatments. Based on these inclusion criteria, Linde et al. analysed 23 out of the 37 identified trials, concluding that \"there is evidence that extracts of hypericum are more effective than placebo for the treatment of mild to moderately severe depressive disorders\" (1996: 253). While use of St. John's Wort had been growing steadily in Germany since 1984,84 it was this meta-analysis published in the British Medical Journal, together with some of the first pre-clinical study results on possible pharmacological 81 A simple PubMed clinical trial-related search gave 109 articles for 'allium', 195 for 'ginkgo' and 116 for 'hypericum'. See also American Botanical Council (1999). 82 As mentioned earlier, Dr. K. Daniel had carried out the first controlled trials with hypericum perforatum before WWII broke out, reflecting a significant German scientific tradition in plant bio-chemistry that was consistent throughout the 20th century (see Timmermann 2001). 83 A commission established by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices following the passing of Germany's Second Medicines Act in 1976 to review the safety and efficacy of 'phytomedicines' available on the German market. 84 By 1997, johanniskraut extract had become the most prescribed single antidepressant in Germany, making up as much as 25% of all prescriptions for antidepressants, sales of Licthwer Pharma's St. John's Wort extracts tripled from $23 million in 1994 to $66 million in 1996 (Muller 2005: 2; Nash and Cray 1997). 151 antidepressant mechanisms of action published in 1994 and 1997 Pharmacopsychiatry supplements, that would re-introduce St. John's Wort to the English-speaking world. In an interesting coincidence, in the exact same months that news of Heantos was breaking in the world press in 1997, a flurry of media stories suggesting that St. John's Wort might be \"Nature's Prozac\" also emerged, citing the recently published clinical and pre-clinical research (see Andrews 1997; Hicks 1997; Johnson, et al. 1997; Nash and Cray 1997). And the effect of this media storm would be tangible as St. John's Wort virtually overnight transformed into one of the world's first herbal 'blockbusters' throughout Europe and America, notwithstanding persistent reminders from herbal practitioners that Hypericum has a much wider use and is most often used by herbalists as one element of a holistic 'polypharmacy' approach (Chevallier 1999: 12, 91).85 Today, two decades after Commission E's monograph was first published, extracts of St. John's Wort remain a popular treatment for especially mild depression, and there is no sign that clinical interest is abating.86 At the same time, it cannot be said that a clear consensus has emerged as to the therapeutic merits of St. John's Wort in the treatment of depression. Debates have centred around five specific concerns: the possibility that St. John's Wort extract can negatively interact with other commonly used drugs; the drastically varied quality of extracts available to unknowing consumers; pharmacologic debates over which of the many active ingredients found in St. John's Wort extract (if any) are responsible for antidepressant activity (which has bearing on extract standardisation and quality control of products); disputes over whether St. John's Wort is only effective in cases of mild depression as opposed to moderate and major depression;87 and finally, whether it is more effective than standard antidepressants. On the other hand, it is widely agreed that St. John's Wort has a much better safety profile than pharmaceutical antidepressants, although concerns about negative drug interactions and low quality extracts have certainly troubled this consensus to some extent. 85 The sales figures for the US market were spectacular in the final years of the 1990s, with some estimates suggesting that sales jumped 190% from $48 million in 1997 to $140 million in 1998. In Europe, sales figures for 1998 have been estimated at $6 billion. And in Britain, an estimated 2 million people were using St. John's Wort in 2000."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-03-20T10:52:13.998647Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T14:17:00.112893Z","inner_id":4,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":275,"annotations":[{"id":291,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":8629,"end":8649,"text":"hypericum

a paper on 'The nature and scope of ethnobotany', Volney Jones (1941) argued that as a discipline it should be \"concerned not only with uses of plants, but with the entire range of relations between primitive man and plant\", which is to say not just economic and medical but also symbolic and cultural. These latter relations have of course been the primary domain of medical anthropologists throughout the 20th century and beyond, who on their part have recently been highlighted for a general and converse \"lack [of] full engagement with phytomedical reality, and... acceptance that the healthcare practices of most people on the planet depend 98 In recent years, many researchers have questioned the economic viability of bio-prospecting as a business model because of the \"elusive value of traditional knowledge\" (see Clapp and Crook 2002). Indeed Shaman Pharmaceuticals, founded in 1989 went bankrupt in 2001. 167 on plants and animals\" (Ellen 2006: 10). As a result, what has been called for today is more of an inter-disciplinary ethno-science that is \"first and foremost, the study of how people of all, and of any, cultural tradition interpret, conceptualize, represent, cope with, utilize, and generally manage their knowledge of those domains of environmental experience which encompass living organisms, and whose scientific study we demarcate as botany, zoology, and ecology\" (ibid. : 2, my emphasis). This is where Heinrich et al. argue that an ethnopharmacological approach to developing medicinally useful complex plant extracts for \"local use\" comes in, as it is an approach which they see as emphasising the \"cultural meaning of resources and understanding of indigenous concepts about plant use and of the selection criteria for medicinal plants\" (2004: 54). Moreover - and perhaps the revitalisation efforts in Vietnam that focused on developing herbal remedies particular to the health needs of rural populations would be taken as a case in point here - they also argue that rather than only look for patentable single-compound drug candidates, an ethno-pharmacological approach will often prioritise 'local solutions for local problems' as a matter of economic and practical feasibility and not necessarily of commercial viability. As argued by Health Minister Pham in 1965: Take for instance the medicinal plants. In the West, scientists abandon plants and resort to chemical synthesis. But what is the extract of a plant, if not a complex body, the product of complicated synthesis? Thus, we have either ready-made medicines or products from which we can make higher synthesis, a good part of which process has already been made by those living laboratories: the plants... [With] traditional medicine, we have at the same time clinical indications to choose the plants for experimentation, and the products of a total or partial synthesis. These are the real short cuts offered us by traditional medicine [and] we are working systematically in this direction. One of the great difficulties of poor countries is lack of medicines. We still have to import a number of products, because our pharmaceutical industry is not yet well developed. Nevertheless, from our experiments with traditional medicine, we have succeeded in preparing a great number of local products... We have even begun to export a number of pharmaceutical products extracted from our country's flora. (Pham 1965: 15) And so, as we have seen in both the British and Vietnamese contexts, while a distinction between ethnopharmacology and bio-prospecting approaches might be tenable to some extent, they can and often do merge and blend into each other. Whatever the particularities of the strategies chosen, it is evident from recent efforts to recapture and exploit age-old traditions and experiences with medicinal plants in these two countries that ethno-sciences, 168 as a particularity of the 20th century, have played and continue to play a pivotal role in the development of their respective traditions of herbal medicine. Disciplining living laboratories Yet it is not only through an ethno-botanic taming of the countryside with the aid of field notes, databases and nomenclatures that the disciplining of herbal medicine is taking place. It is also increasingly taking place in chemistry laboratories filled with high-tech extraction apparatus, chromatographs and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopes. It is in these laboratories that the biomass plant samples collected and taxonomised by herbalists and ethno-scientists are subject to labour intensive phytochemical scrutiny - soaked in extraction solvents, percolated, centrifuged, filtered, dried, partitioned, separated, elucidated and finally characterised in their chemical multiplicities. It is a process which is not only necessary for subsequent pharmacological mechanism of action research, but is equally necessary for those regulatory efforts that seek to assure consumers, as best possible, that they can expect some kind of standardised quality, not to mention safety, of the industrialised herbal products they purchase. For, if there is one thing that is characteristic of phytochemistry, it is that it is a science of ranges that seeks to apply some kind of consistency to the notoriously inconsistent 'chemists' that plants have been shown to be. Whatever disagreements herbalists and scientists may have over specific mechanisms of action as well as concepts used to account for these mechanisms, there is broad agreement that it is the chemicals found in a plant that have a therapeutically significant effect on the body's physiological functioning when ingested. There is also agreement that the amount and quality of chemicals found in an extract of a particular plant species is dependent on growing conditions (soil, climate, weather conditions, pesticide use), time of harvest (before or after flowering, early morning or evening), which part of the plant is used (flower, leaves, stem, bark), extraction processes (drying, grinding, boiling, solvent used), as well as storage conditions (humidity, light, temperature). And while all this can be complicated enough with a single-plant like St. John's Wort, it becomes even more complex when working with a thirteen-plant herbal remedy like Heantos. Plants may well be superb chemists, but the exploitation of the chemicals they produce is dependent on both the conditions in which they 'naturally' produce them and the expertise in extracting them from the plants into a form suitable for ingestion. And so while sustainable cultivation 169 practices are increasingly being developed with the aim of optimising growing conditions for medicinal plant species, phytochemistry has been harnessed in herbal medicine to help reduce batch-to-batch inconsistencies, by breaking plant or remedy extracts down into identifiable single chemical compounds that can be isolated, chemically characterised and thereby used as markers in the standardisation of herbal products. These optimised cultivation practices and standardised chemical markers, it is argued, can then replace a herbalist's traditional organoleptic evaluation of medicinal herbs (taste, smell, texture, appearance) when controlling for quality in industrially produced herbal medicinal products. The goal is to ensure \"a consistent content of therapeutically active constituent(s)... irrespective of the year of harvest and the year of production\" (Gaedcke and Steinhoff 2002: 16) by standardising production procedures.99 This of course means that in order to be able to standardise a herbal medicinal product according to a defined range of therapeutically active constituents, a manufacturer requires not only a clear understanding of what is to be standardised (i.e. which chemical compounds), but also an understanding of how to ensure more or less controlled cultivation and harvest, of appropriate production methods which will not damage or degrade chemical constituents excessively during extraction, and of acceptable ranges of constituent content in the final plant extract products. These are the specific problems related to the production of plant extract based products as opposed to single active compound drugs. St. John's Wort is a single-plant remedy, even if very often used by herbalists in combination with other medicinal plants. Not only has it become one of the most clinically studied plants in the world, as we saw in chapter 5, it has also become one of the most phytochemically and pharmacologically studied plants in the past few decades. With a long history of documented medicinal use, St. John's Wort (or hypericum perforatum) has recently been described as a \"prolific producer of secondary metabolites\" (Muller 2005: 5). One of the first of these to have been isolated and characterised is the naphtodianthrone hypericin, a red pigment long known for secreting when the yellow flowers of St. John's Wort are squeezed by hand. It has also been found to be the culprit in causing hypericism (a 99 As Gaedcke and Steinhoff (2002) point out, it should be underscored that in far from all herbal plants and remedies have therapeutically active constituents been pharmacologically identified. For these herbal medicinal products, 'standardisation' refers to the implementation of standardised Good Manufacturing Procedures which can ensure some kind of batch-to-batch consistency. 170 disease that leads to potentially lethal photosensitisation) in cattle who feed off of the plant, and as a result it has been described as defence agent of the plant. Perhaps not so surprisingly then, it was also hypericin that became one of the first lead candidates in the phytochemical search for active compounds that might explain its anti-depressant effects. But hypericum perforatum has since been found to contain many more classes of secondary metabolites including phloroglucinols (mainly hyperforin and adhyperforin), flavonoids (quercetin, rutin and hyperoside), biflavonoids (biapigenin), xanthones, proanthocyanidins (catechin), acid phenols (p-coumric, ferulic and caffeic acids) and essential oils (including 2-methyloctane, limonene and myrcene). To date, pharmacological studies have singled out hypericin, hyperforin, quercetin and rutin as candidate compounds when accounting for St. John's Wort's anti-depressant action. As much as is now pharmacologically known about the active constituents and possible mechanisms of action which might account for any experienced anti-depressant effects, it remains very difficult to devise standardisation procedures for St. John's Wort products. To begin with, comparisons of the composition of eight key chemical constituents in different St. John's Wort plant specimens have shown variations of as much as 700% in individual constituent content measured in micrograms\/flowers (Muller 2005: 16). And while the German Commission E monographs (published in the 1980s) recommend that products be standardised according to a range of hypericin content (0.2-1 mg of total hypericin per 2-4 g of herbal drug), more recent research has suggested that hyperforin is more prominent in generating anti-depressant pharmacologic action. Moreover, hyperforin has been shown to be so chemically unstable (due to a liability to oxidative degeneration) that standardisation according to hyperforin content requires very sophisticated and costly extraction techniques. With so many variables at play, it is little wonder that an LA Times-commissioned chemical analysis of 10 St. John's Wort brands from 1998 found considerable discrepancies between what was promised on labels in terms of hypericin content and what was found to be present in sample capsules (three brands contained no more than half the listed amount and four had less than 90% of the listed amount) (Monmaney 1998). The challenge for standardising St. John's Wort then, has become one of balancing a need for suitable (preferably therapeutically relevant) biochemical markers that can ensure batch-to-batch consistency within an accepted range of marker constituents on the one hand, and 171 on the other to ensure that the entire spectrum of chemicals particular to St. John's Wort are present in any whole plant extract products made from it. Ensuring that a final herbal drug preparation contains a certain constituent within a defined content range, either by adding inert adjustment material (e.g. lactose) or blending extract (of the same plant), can ironically enough diminish the quality of the original or so-called 'native extract', and as a result, it is argued \"the initial question prior to adjustment should always be, if it is considered more important to administer a sufficient quantity of native extract or a defined quantity of the constitutent(s) the extract is to be adjusted to\" (Gaedcke and Steinhoff 2002: 17). The answer to this initial question is far from clear cut with pharmacologists probably inclined to favour the latter and herbalists the former. For example, herbalist Peter Conway argues that \"most herbalists would rather use a St. John's Wort preparation that has a natural balance of constituents, achieved through good growing, harvesting and processing, over one that has unnaturally high amounts of one element, as in many standardised products\" (2003: 21). Bearing in mind that 'natural' variation in this \"natural balance of constituents\" can be considerable, Conway does suggest that \"it is possible to check the quality of herbal preparations and ensure that there are the right amounts of a broad spectrum of the desirable chemicals present in the product without artificially altering their relative amounts\" (ibid. ).100 And so the problem remains of just how to define what is meant by the \"right amounts\", a task that invariably will require some kind of 'normal spectrum' marker profiles against which batches can be checked or 'quality controlled'. As already mentioned, herbalists in both Vietnam and the United Kingdom have in the past relied extensively on organoleptic evaluations of quality, either as they gather their starting materials from the wild or upon purchasing them from commercial suppliers or at medicinal herb markets. However, as we saw in chapter 4, regulations in both countries are increasingly requiring laboratory-confirmed quality assurances for especially industrially produced herbal products, but also for starting materials. And it is in these practices of quality assurance that control profiles based on chromatographic 'fingerprints' have become crucial. By using thin layer (TLC), gas liquid (GLC) and high performance liquid (HPLC) chromatography methods, a plant extract can be broken down into its various chemical constituents, appearing as either bars on a TLC chromatogram or peaks on GLC and HPLC chromatograms. And just as the fingerprints from a crime scene can be checked 100 Mills concurs arguing that \"although there is variability, it is within workable limits, and quality control can reduce it even further\" (1993: 262). 172 against a database of past suspects for a match, so too can the chromatograms from a new batch of herbal medicine extract be checked against constituent control 'profiles' to ensure a standard batch-to-batch consistency.101 For, once chromatographically separated, chemical constituents can be phytochemically identified using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or mass spectrometry, which allow for three-dimensional structure elucidation of an individual molecule of the chemical constituent under scrutiny. The goal being to identify suitable marker compounds unique to the medicinal herb in question, which can then be used to build chemical reference profiles based on norms of purity and content. It is also these isolated chemical constituents which can then be individually assayed for possible pharmacologic actions (something we will return to later in this chapter), and thereby classed into groups of either therapeutically active constituents (i.e. those \"with known therapeutic activity\"), active constituents (i.e. those \"which contribute to therapeutic efficacy\"), or marker substances (i.e. those \"which, according to the state of scientific knowledge, do not contribute to therapeutic activity... [yet] are suitable for identification tests and assay (e.g. batch-to-batch control)\") (Gaedcke and Steinhoff 2002: 22-3). Hence, the standardisation of St. John's Wort products today is carried out using not only quantitative content ranges for hypericin and\/or hyperforin (expressed in terms of mg per daily dose) which have been identified as pharmaceutically relevant constituents, but also qualitative chromatographic standards which reflect an aim to ensure that an extract contains the plant's 'full spectrum' of constituents in relevant amounts. Ethno-chemistry Now, as we can see, the challenge of standardisation in the case of St. John's Wort has been a time-consuming, costly and technically sophisticated affair. So much so that one can only imagine the magnitude of such a task when presented with a mixed extract containing all of thirteen different plants, such as Heantos. When Tran Khuong Dan approached the health authorities in Vietnam with his herbal mixture for the treatment of drug addicts, his remedy came in the form of a dark, rather earthy-tasting syrup, the result of a complex process of cutting, drying, boiling and mixing. As already highlighted, Dan had spent many years learning from the experiences of fellow traditional practitioners, by travelling 101 Recall that the Institute of Drug Quality Control in Vietnam has, over the years, built up a library of such 'profiles' against which they check the quality of 'raw material' plant samples collected from various medicinal herb markets (see chapter 4). 173 throughout the countryside collecting over one hundred home-made recipes for treating opium addiction in the 1980s. On the basis of this gathered 'ethno-knowledge' combined with information gleaned from classic medicinal texts (most of which were written in Chinese and Nom102), Dan began experimenting with various herb combinations and preparation methods. It was at this time, during the late 1980s, that Dan decided to intentionally addict himself to opium in order to personally evaluate the different remedy batches. He would later argue that \"the only way I could test my medication was to experience the torture of withdrawal for myself\" (Tran 1999). And so, through a period of two years, Dan would undergo a series of self-inflicted withdrawals, all the while experimenting on himself with the different mixtures he would devise. Dan's final choice fell on a set of thirteen plants and a complex processing protocol which together would consistently produce a herbal remedy for treating addiction. As a complex mixture, Heantos would target each of the individual withdrawal symptoms common in addicts undergoing 'cold turkey', redress what Dan has described as \"the continuous shortage of drugs in the brain of the addict\", and restore balance and health to the addicts (ibid.). It was using this home-brewed syrup that health officials in Vietnam carried out their first trials on the efficacy of Heantos in treating addiction in the early 1990s.103 Since 1995, however, as we saw in the previous chapter, Tran Khuong Dan has donned a white laboratory coat in an interesting collaboration with some of Vietnam's top scientists at Hanoi's Institute of Chemistry, as part of an international effort to standardise and further develop Heantos."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-03-20T10:52:13.998647Z","updated_at":"2024-03-20T15:08:41.665474Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":276,"annotations":[{"id":292,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":516,"end":520,"text":"heal","labels":["Medicinal

of the most important recasts that I have described has been the challenging of an evolutionary anthropology, which had its heyday in the 19th century, by a social and cultural anthropology in the early 20th century. The effect of this challenge was to flatten racist civilisational hierarchies through an insistence that we are all human subjects, regardless of cultural, social or geographical origin. We may well ascribe to different worldviews, adopt different cultural practices in efforts to, for example, heal ourselves, or enjoy different forms of food, but we are nonetheless all subjects whose practices are informed by worldviews, cultural values and social norms, as different as they may be. Indeed, it is exactly in its effort to map out these different worldviews, collective cognitive frameworks, and social norms that anthropology and sociology have reinforced this universally human subject. If anything, I would argue that Vietnamese regulators, herbal practitioners, doctors and community workers are well 'ahead' of their British counterparts when it comes to modernising, rationalising and industrialising the production, practice and use of herbal medicine. While distinctions between western and Vietnamese medicine certainly persist to this day, there has been a consistent call to \"unify\" and \"collaborate\" - reflected in the ways in which public health delivery is organised. Vietnamese chemists, botanists and pharmacologists have been travelling the countryside since the 1960s to collect folk remedies, and to collaborate with apprentice-trained practitioners in identifying medicinal plants and in modernising traditional remedies. In the United Kingdom, the Ethnomedica-research group with a similar mandate was set up as recently as 1999. Moreover, while practices of self-regulation by British herbalists date back to the mid 19th century, it was not until 2001 that a Herbal Medicine Working Group was set up to investigate the possibility of statutory recognition for herbal practitioners. In Vietnam, as we saw, traditional herbal practitioners have been actively recruited into the public health delivery system since the late 1950s. Now, to suggest that Vietnamese herbal practitioners, scientists and government officials have been somehow duped into modernising, rationalising and industrialising their herbal medicines by a hegemony of 'western rationalities' is in my view to completely miss the point, if not outright condescending. As already emphasised, whether herbal medicine in Vietnam is better or worse off following six decades of modernising, rationalising and industrialising or whether it could have been done better are questions that cannot be concluded on the basis of my analysis. What I can say without hesitation is that these 233 processes have been robustly and actively pursued by herbalists, doctors and government officials alike - not without disagreement or debate, but pursued nonetheless as described in my analysis. Histories of the present and their limitations In chapter 2, I made a point of distinguishing a history of the present approach to investigating the revival of herbal medicine in Vietnam and the United Kingdom from those of a sociology of health and illness, a sociology of professions, and a sociology of knowledge. In doing so, I wanted to emphasise that I would be asking a different type of question than would have been posed had I chosen one of these latter approaches. I also argued that the critical contribution my study would make would be one of troubling self-evidences and historicising practices rather than exposing shams or identifying shortcomings. As a direct consequence, there are of course many aspects of traditional herbal medicine in these two countries that have not been covered in the preceding chapters. I have not, for example, provided a detailed analysis of the regulatory and policy frameworks and processes within which herbal medicine has been mobilised in each of the countries. This would have entailed mapping out and following the processes of policy formulation, implementation and review. I could have spent many more hours speaking to Ministry of Health officials, and sifting through many more pages of legislation and policy proposals than I have. I could also have written an entire dissertation on recent efforts to professionalise and organise local district level associations of traditional practitioners in Vietnam or on ongoing efforts to unify herbal practitioners (whether Western, Chinese, Tibetan or Ayurvedic) in the United Kingdom under one umbrella professional association. Neither can I claim to be at this time an erudite expert in the teachings and texts of either Sino-Vietnamese medicine or western herbal medicine. I could certainly have committed myself to a much more in-depth immersion in the conceptual universes of Vietnamese and British herbal medicine and the medical texts upon which they have been built up. This would have entailed many more exchanges with herbal practitioners, and perhaps even concerted efforts to begin training myself in the art of herbalism. In the same way, I could also have concentrated my entire fieldwork on the phytochemical laboratories in which pharmacological work to understand the workings of herbal medicines and pharmaceutical work to improve extraction and production procedures are taking place. I could have followed the trials, errors and successes of the scientists and herbalists in the laboratories in 234 a much more detailed way, attempting to understand how they arrive at the findings they do, errors made along the way, and new challenges arising from their work. And finally, without having carried out ethnographic field observations and interviews I have of course not been able to provide a \"patient's eye view\" of herbal medicine use, its cultural meanings, the innovative ways in which people use herbal medicine in their day-to-day healthcare activities, or the functions it fulfils in generating individual coping strategies. It would have been fascinating, for example, to have identified a rural village in Vietnam where the \"Doctor at Home\" programme has been introduced and spent time looking at the everyday ways in which such programmes are adopted and\/or rejected. Similarly I have not spent sufficient time with herbal practitioners in their practices observing the ways in which they interact with their patients, the challenges they face when working with biomedical doctors, or the microphysics of the power relationships that are emerging out of ongoing professionalisation efforts, to be able to provide a \"practitioner's view\" on herbal medicine in the two countries in question. With so much happening in terms of the professionalisation of British herbal medicine, it would undoubtedly have been rewarding to spend more time delving into the practicalities of this process, as well as the ways in which it is being received and debated. As I have already highlighted, the point to be made is that each of these limitations that have arisen on the back of the methodological choices I made to begin with, suggest fields of study which merit monographs in themselves - and indeed there are plenty of researchers who in fact are carrying out such studies. As such, a more pertinent point to reflect on when discussing the limitations of my approach regards the analytical findings and conclusions that I have summarised above. What is it that my study can tell us about British and Vietnamese herbal medicine and just as importantly what is it unable to conclude? My aim has been to establish the contours of the conditions of possibility that can help us to explain ongoing efforts to mobilise and revive British and Vietnamese herbal medicine. How have these efforts become possible? At the same time, I have also aimed to demonstrate that these efforts inevitably entail liabilities as well, and that one of the self-reflexive components of these efforts has been exactly to try and offset some of these liabilities by insisting on humanised and holistic processes of modernisation. This is a very different critical task than that which is perhaps characteristic of the sub-disciplines of medical anthropology and medical sociology, which have often explicitly worked to 235 demonstrate the shortcomings of a particular form of medicine (usually biomedicine) while advocating more 'holistic' or 'socio-culturally grounded' forms of medical intervention. The links between medical sociology and medical activism, as I have noted, are intimate. Nevertheless, it is of course standard fare to be asked of and held accountable for the normative contributions that academic endeavours like this current study deliver. And to answer this, I would highlight the conceptual moves proposed in the preceding chapters much more than any kind of practical reforms or improvements of regulatory or healing interventions that concern British and Vietnamese herbal medicine. As I demonstrated in the beginning of this dissertation, incommensurability between the modern and the traditional, biomedicine and alternative medicine, or holism and reductionism have permeated much of the research and policy work done in this field. If anything, this study has shown that, first of all, incommensurability becomes increasingly difficult to discern the further you delve into the microphysics of traditional herbal medicine. And, second of all, to the extent that there are incommensurabilities, these are increasingly being tackled and addressed as technical hurdles to be overcome. Perhaps this point would not have been as accentuated as it has been in my study had I chosen crystallography in the United Kingdom and traditional healing in Vietnam as my empirical sites rather than herbal medicine, or had I chosen to seek out those 'dissident' voices who resist all efforts to \"combine\" modern and traditional medicine in Vietnam, or to \"professionalise\" herbal medicine in the UK. Nevertheless, it should certainly be clear from my analysis that that which is celebrated as 'holistic' and 'human' has objectifying effects in the same way that a 'reductionist' and 'mechanistic' biomedicine is seen to have objectifying effects. And similarly, while traditional and alternative medicine are often highlighted for their subject-centred approaches to healing, biomedicine and the various theories of life that it encompasses without question also have subjectifying effects. And so, while one of the crucial limitations of a history of the present is its inability to provide concrete and stable proposals for reforming, improving or mainstreaming that which it studies (not least because any such proposals would be instantly open to genealogical and archaeological scrutiny), one of its most important contributions is the kind of 'attitude' that it brings to the critical task. It is not about breaking down or exposing the insidious effects of various power-knowledge constellations and the ontologies they engender, rather it is to bring a certain humility and deference to these assemblages, 236 whether they derive from a 'hegemonic' biomedicine or a 'subjugated' alternative medicine. Deference, because these assemblages of power-knowledge relations will always have their side effects. 237 References Ackerknecht, E.
