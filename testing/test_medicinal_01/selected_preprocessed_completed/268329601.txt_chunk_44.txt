Fresh cut leaves are soakedfor about half a day and aerated. The blue precipitatethat develops settles out. This is dried and becomesthe "indigo cake." When indigo became popular, it metstiff resistance from the woad dyers (the "Woadites").In 1577, England "...prohibited under the severestpenalties... the newly invented, harmful, balefullydevouring, pernicious, deceitful, eating and corrosivedye known as 'the devil's dye'...."Madder (Rubia tinctorum). The brilliant red dye isextracted from the roots. The roots are washed, dried,and then pulverized. The color of madder will varywith the mordant.Logwood (Haematoxylon campechianum). This treeis native to Mexico and Central America. The dye isextracted from the heartwood. The dark purple dye isused on cotton, leather, furs and silk. Logwood is alsothe basis of a black ink and the histological stainwidely used in biology.Annatto (Bixa orellana). The annatto plant is nativeto Brazil, but it is now very widely planted. The dyecomes from the pulp around the seeds. It may beextracted with water or some solvent, such as-150-chloroform. Annatto is an orange dye that is widelyused as a food coloring in cheese, butter, andmargarine; as a condiment on rice; as a dye; as a skinpaint; and as an ingredient in lipstick.Saffron (Crocus sativus). This was the principalyellow dye of ancient times. It is extracted from thestigmas of the flowers.Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius). This thistle-likeplant is native to Asia. The dye is obtained from theflowering heads. This dye has been used as a saffronsubstitute. Safflower is also the source of an importantoil.DYE PLANTS OF THE U.

BAMBOOS &GOURDSPlants of industry and technology suggest those thatare the basis of large and sophisticated corporateentities, such as rubber, cotton, and timber. There aremany other plants that are used locally andindividually by peoples around the world. In therealms of economic botany and anthropology, theseconstitute examples of the material culture ortechnology of a culture.To my way of thinking, the bamboos and the cucurbitsor squashes, offer us many excellent examples ofthese "non-corporate" plants of industry.BAMBOOS"It is quite possible not to eat meat, but not to bewithout bamboo." (Su Dongpo, Song Dynasty poet)"Bamboo is my brother." (Vietnamese proverb)' ' ' ' 'Bamboos, or tree grasses as they are sometimescalled, constitute one subfamily of the grasses. Thereare about 1200-1500 species, native to everycontinent but Antarctica and Europe. They range frommodest shrubs to large tropical bamboos over 120 ft.tall and about one foot in diameter. Some of thembloom every year, others on an irregular basis, andstill others only after several decades. Bamboos growmore rapidly than any other plant. The record appearsto be 47.6 inches in a 24 hour period!Several authors have stated with some certainty thatno other single group of plants has so many differentuses - Hans Sporry in 1903 compiled a list of 1048them.

Fishingpoles, timber, paper pulp, walking sticks, umbrellahandles, musical instruments, and furniture.GOURDSA gourd is generally defined as the hard-shelled,durable fruit of the squash family (Cucurbitaceae) thatis grown for making various utensils, for orna-ment,and for a wide variety of minor uses. Here is a farfrom complete list of how we have used gourds:' bottles' storage containers' eating utensils' drinking cups' snuff boxes' bird houses' cricket containers' pipes' masks' hats' penis sheaths (yes, really)' decoration' floats' artistry (carving, painting)' musical instruments (rattles, scrapers, etc.)' grown as curiosities because of size/shapeA KEY TO GOURDS*1.

We have good fossil remains fromEgypt (3500 BCE), from Peru (12,000 BP), and fromMexico and Thailand (7000 BCE). Was it distributed inPre-Columbian times by us or by ocean currents? Bothviews have their advocates. The exterior of this gourdis tough, almost woody, and more or less imperviousto water. That explains its ability to float longdistances and its use as a container. The bottle gourdis also a favorite of artists who paint on or carveintricate designs in its woody surface.The loofa (loofah, luffa) or vegetable sponge(Luffa aegyptiaca) is native to the Old World. Maturefruits the softer outer skin and inner flesh have rottedaway. Once the seeds have been removed, theremaining vascular system (the plumbing system ofthe fruit) is bleached to yield the familiar luffa sponge.You may have one hanging in your bathroom or youknow someone who does. The next time that you havethe opportunity, turn the luffa on end and notice thethree chambers that run the length of the fruit. This isa standard feature of the squash family. They wereonce filled with seeds.Recent magazine advertisements taut the virtues ofthe vegetable sponge as the "Amazing oriental plantthat helps to wipe away ugly cellulite in just minutesa day!" Oh, really?Tree-gourd. If you see a gourd growing on a tree, itis not a true gourd. It is probably the fruit of thecalabash tree (Crescentia cejute) a member of thefamily Bignoniaceae. Its gourd-like berries are used tomake bowls, scoops, etc. Larger fruits have had eyeholes cut in them to camouflage fishermen who swiminto flocks of birds and pull them underwater withoutalarming the others.THE GOURDSAsh gourd Benincasa hispidaBalsam pear Momordica charantiaBitter gourd Momordica charantiaBottle gourd Lagenaria sicerariaBuffalo gourd Cucurbita foetidissimaCalabash gourd Lagenaria sicerariaChinese snake gourd Trichosanthes kirilowiiClub gourd Trichosanthes cucumerinaDipper gourd Lagenaria sicerariaFig-leaf gourd Cucurbita ficifoliaGoar berry gourd Cucumis anguriaGooseberry gourd Cucumis anguriaHedge-hog gourd Cucumis metuliferusIvy gourd Coccinia grandisMalabar gourd Cucurbita ficifoliaOrnamental gourd Cucurbita pepoPointed gourd Trichosanthes dioicaPrairie gourd Cucurbita foetidissimaScallop gourd Cucurbita pepoSerpent gourd Trichosanthes cucumerinaSiamese gourd Cucurbita ficifoliaSilver-seed gourd Cucurbita mixtaSnake gourd Trichosanthes cucumerinaSpine gourd Momordica dioicaSweet gourd Momordica cochinchinensisTeasel gourd Cucumis dipsaceusTexas gourd Cucurbita pepo-153-Tree gourd* Crescentia cejuteTrumpet gourd Lagenaria sicerariaTurban gourd Cucurbita maximaViper's gourd Trichosanthes cucumerinaWax gourd Benincasa hispidaWhite-flowered gourd Lagenaria sicerariaYellow-flowered gourd Cucurbita pepo* This is the only plant on this list that is not a member ofthe squash family (Cucurbitaceae).-154-SECTION 9.0 ! POISONOUS PLANTS9.1 - AN OVERVIEW' The toxic compounds that plants make areprobably, in many cases, a defense mechanismagainst being eaten. In other instances, we arenot quite certain.' Curiously enough, we knowingly or unknowinglyexperience the symptoms of toxicity from plantpoisons when we use plant-derived medicinesand psychoactive materials.' Many of our most valuable food plants comefrom plant families that are notorious for theirtoxicity, such as the carrot family, mustardfamily, and nightshade family.' A poisonous plant is not necessarily a lethal one.' There are many factors that influence the toxiceffects that a plant will have on its victim.'
