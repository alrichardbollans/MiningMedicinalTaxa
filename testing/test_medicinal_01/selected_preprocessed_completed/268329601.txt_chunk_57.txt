PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS11.1 - AN OVERVIEW' The plant kingdom is the source of most of thesubstances that affect our mental processes,behavior, or that alter our perception of theuniverse around us.' We have become dependent upon a series ofplant products that provide these psychoactiveeffects.' Many of these plants are used by individuals;others are used more commonly in a ceremonialor ritual context where they have becomeimportant elements in our religions, myths, andmagic.' These plants contain one or more chemicals(often alkaloids) that stimulate, depress, producea sense of well-being, or cause us to hallucinate.' This category overlaps with medicinal plants(opiates, cocaine, marijuana), beverages (tea,coffee, cocoa, alcohol), spices (nutmeg), andrecreational ones (tobacco).' Only a few of these plants (tobacco, alcohol, tea,coffee, cacao, coca, marijuana, and opium) are ofeconomic significance. Most of the others areused locally.' Most of what we experience from psychoactiveplants can be explained by the toxic effects thatthey have on our central nervous system.' For some yet unexplained reason, the New Worldhas more psychoactive plants than the Old World.' Many psychoactive plants are not as dangerousas their critics suggest, nor are they as risk freeas their proponents believe them to be.' Terms such as psychoactive, hallucinogenic,addictive, and narcotic have reasonably precisedefinitions, but they are often lost in everydaydiscussions.' Recent research has brought into question thepsychoactive properties of several plants withlong standing reputations, such as the mescalbean.11.2 ! INTRODUCTION"If human consciousness is the most wonderful thingon earth, the attempt to fathom the depths of thepsychophysiological action of narcotic and stimulatingdrugs makes this wonder seem greater still.... Sucheffects are brought about by chemical substances. Themost powerful of these are products of the vegetablekingdom, into whose silent growth and creativeabundance man has not yet fully penetrated. By theexercise of their powers on the brain, they releasemarvelous stores of latent energy. They relieve thementally tortured, assuage the racking pains of thesick, inspire with hope those doomed to death, endowthe overworked with new vitality and vigour such asno strength of will could attain, and replace for anhour the exhaustion and langour of the overworked bymental comfort and conten(tL. "ouis Lewin, Phantastica)"Experiences with plant drugs have puzzled andfascinated our species for millennia. They haverevealed substances powerful enough to heal or to kill.Yet, whether they help or hurt, these plants are alsopursued for their power to intoxicate with stimulating,inebriating, tranquilizing, or hallucinogenic properties.We search our planetary garden for these mind-altering delights with a passion so blinding that thegarden becomes a labyrinth, the search becomes thegoal, and our passion becomes addiction. "(Ronald Siegel, Intoxication)"Every kind of addiction is bad, no matter whether thedrug be alcohol, morphine or idealism." (Carl Jung)' ' ' ' 'There are about 250,000 different kinds of plants.Only a 150 or so have been used as sources ofpsychoactive substances in either primitive oradvanced societies. Siegel (1989) has suggested thatif we look at the history of our species we will discoverthat the use of these intoxicants is one our four basicdrives, along with hunger, thirst, and sex. Of theseplants, only tobacco, opium, coca, cacao, marijuana,coffee, tea, and alcohol are of any commercialimportance.WHAT TO CALL THEM?Scholars have found it difficult to come up with anacceptable collective name for this category of plants.Those that have been suggested include: deliriants,delusionegens, eidetics, entheogens, genussmittel,hallucinogens, misperceptinogens, mysticomimetics,phanerothymes, phantastica, phantasticants,psychedelics, psychodelics, psychotica, psychoticants,psychogens, psychosimetics, psychodysleptics,psychotaraxics, psychotogens, psychomimetics,psychotomimetics, psychotropic, and schizogens.WHY DO WE USE THEM?Various authors have suggested the following reasonsfor our use of these plants. They are not in anyparticular order of importance.' to alter moods' to explore self' to escape boredom and despair' to enhance sensory experiences and pleasure' to stimulate artistic creativity and performance' to improve physical performance' to treat disease' to rebel-197-' to go along with peers' to establish an identity' to aid in religious experiences.HOW DO WE USE THEM?We have discovered a variety of ways of introducingpsychoactive materials into our bodies. Eating,drinking, and smoking of plant materials come quicklyto mind. Less obvious methods include mastication(chewing on plant material without swallowing it),inhaling/snuffing, applying materials to the skin (oftenmixed with animal fat), putting finely ground powdersunder our eyelids, injecting via the hypodermic needle(a 19th century invention), and inserting material intothe nostrils, rectum, and vagina.These different approaches have something incommon. They are designed to bring the psychoactivesubstance into contact with capillary-rich tissues or tointroduce them directly into the circulatory system.This is their pathway to chemical binding sites in thecentral nervous system. Depending on the methodemployed and the chemicals involved, it can take onlya few seconds to a few minutes for these psychoactivesubstances to reach the brain.THEIR EFFECTSWe are dealing here with plant materials that haveprofound or significant effects on our mentalprocesses. They affect our mental activity, ourbehavior, and even our perceptions of the worldaround us. Many of these substances are intoxicantsthat either dull the senses or stimulate them. Othersare narcotics. In the popular sense, this term is usedfor any dangerous drug. In the narrower sense,narcotics are those materials that induce drowsiness,sleep, or anesthesia. Some of these plants canproduce addiction. You can become enslaved to itsuse. Addiction is characterized by craving for thematerial, developing a tolerance to it, and sufferingreasonably serious trauma when we attempt to ceaseusing it (withdrawal).The classification developed by Louis Lewin (1931)may be helpful in understanding the breadth of effectsof psychoactive plants. He recognized five classes:Excitantia. "Their action, which extends to the brainand particularly to the cerebral cortex, is a purelyexciting or stimulating one, which, even if highlyconcentrated and intense, produces these effectswithout calling forth serious symptoms of fatigue orinhibition of the functions." Examples: tobacco,caffeinated beveragesInebriantia. "A primary phase of cerebral excitationis followed by a state of depression which mayeventually extend to complete temporary suppressionof functions." Examples: alcoholic beveragesHypnotica. These are the sleep-producing agents.Example: kavaEuphorica. "These substances diminish or evensuspend the functions of emotion and perception intheir widest sense, sometimes reducing orsuppressing, sometimes conserving consciousness,inducing in the person concerned a state of physicaland mental comfort." Examples: coca and opiumPhantastica. "... I mean the action of chemicalsubstances capable of evoking such transitory stateswithout any physical inconvenience for a certain timein persons of perfectly normal mentality who arepartly or fully conscious of the action of the drug...These phenomena may be accompanied or followed byunconsciousness or other symptoms of alteredcerebral functioning." Examples: marijuana, fly agaric,sacred mush-rooms, nutmeg, Jimson weed, andpeyoteYou may be surprised to find coffee, tea, chocolate,and the various alcoholic beverages classed aspsychoactive. How could it be otherwise? These plantshave been discussed elsewhere and will not be treatedfurther here. The remaining three categoriesconstitute the subjects for this section. The last class,the Phantastica, is probably the most interesting.These plants, in particular, have been afforded a veryspecial place in both primitive and advanced societies.They are the plants that bring about hallucinations.We can perceive an external object or stimulus withany of our five senses. There are visual (sight),auditory (hearing), olfactory (smell), tactile (touch),and gustatory (taste) hallucinations.SOME CHEMICALCONSIDERATIONSThe chemical basis of the activity of the many plantsclassed as psychoactive is incompletely understood.Many species have had their active principles analyzedin great detail. Others remain completely unknown.The chemical nature of the Excitantia and Inebriantiahave been discussed elsewhere. Kava of the Hypnoticacontains methysticin and other components in a seriesof related substituted 5,6-dihydro-a-pyrones. Coca ofthe "Euphorica" contains about 25 alkaloids, of whichcocaine is the best known. The hallucinogens ofLewin's "Phantastica" contain a variety of activeprinciples, most of them containing nitrogen. A few ofthe hallucinogens are partly or wholly synthetic.Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), for instance, doesnot occur naturally in plants, although LSD-likesubstances are found.CHEMISTRY OF THE PSYCHOACTIVESGroup: Plant Chemical GroupExcitantia:Tobacco Alkaloids (nicotine)Coffee Alkaloids (caffeine)Tea Alkaloids (caffeine)Chocolate Alkaloids (caffeine)Khat Alkaloids (d-norpseudoephedrine)Inebriantia:Alcoholic beverages Alcohol (ethanol)Hypnotica:Kava kava Dihydro-a-pyronesEuphorica:Coca leaf Alkaloids (cocaine)Opium Alkaloids (morphine codeine)Betel nut Alkaloids (arecoline)Phantastica (Hallucinogens):Ayahusaca Alkaloids (tryptamine carboline)Belladonna Alkaloids (tropane)Datura (Jimson weed) Alkaloids (tropane)Fly agaric Alkaloids (muscimol)Marijuana Resins (tetrahydrocanninols)-198-Mescal bean Alkaloids (quinolizidine)Nutmeg Phenylpropenes (myristicin)Ololiuqui Alkaloids (ergoline)Peyote Alkaloids (mescaline)Sacred mushrooms Alkaloids (tryptamine)Snuffs Alkaloids (tryptamine)P S Y C H O A C T I V E P L A N T SGroup: Family Scientific Name (Common Name) Part Used Where Used (Type)FUNGIAgaricaceae Amanita muscaria (fly agaric, soma) Sporocarp Eurasia (H)Agaricaceae Conocybe spp. (sacred mushroom) Sporocarp Mexico (H)Agaricaceae Panaeolus sphinctrinus (sacred mushroom) Sporocarp Mexico (H)Boletaceae Boletus spp. (kuma mushroom) Sporocarp New Guinea (H)Clavicepitaceae Claviceps purpurea (ergot) Sclerotium (beak) Widespread (H)Lycoperdaceae Lycoperdon mixtecorum (gi-i-wa) Sporocarp Mexico (H)Lycoperdaceae Lycoperdon marginatum (gi-i-sa-wa) Sporocarp Europe & N.
