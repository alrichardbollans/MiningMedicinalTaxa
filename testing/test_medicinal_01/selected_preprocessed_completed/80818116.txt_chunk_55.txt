G. Bonchev Str., build. 9, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria* deni@orgchm.bas.bgIntroductionNitrofurantoin (N-(5-nitro-2-furfurylidene)-1-amino-hydantoin) is antimicrobial compound, used extensively as a prophylactic for urinary tract infections in humans and animals (Maaland and Guardabassi, 2011). It is reported that the modes of action underlying DNA damage or cyto-toxicity induced by nitrofurantoin in rodent liver and lungs may involve ROS generation by reduction to nitro radi-cal anion (Suntres and Shek, 1992). A recent study showed that the drug exhibits carcinogenicity in the kidneys of male rats and the structure of the nitro furan plays a key role in the induced genotoxicity (Kijima et al., 2015).Most nitroaromatic drugs, containing nitroquinone, ni-troimidazole or nitrofuran moiety, are considered to ex-ert their toxic effect by nitro reduction (Boelsterli et al., 2006). One-electron reduction of the nitro group catalyzed by nitro-reductase gives rise to nitro anion radical, the chemical instability of which promotes production of var-ious ROS such as superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical via its electron-donating ability (Wang et al., 2008).Despite these drawbacks, new nitrofuran derivatives are still being developed as antimicrobial agents (Zorzi et al., 2014). Therefore, improved knowledge on the struc-ture and reactivity of nitrofurantoin radical anion could help reduce the toxicity of the new nitrofuran antimicro-bial agents.This reports motivated us to generate electrochemi-cally the nitro radical anion of nitrofurantoin and study its chemical structure by spectroscopic IR methods and DFT computations. The radical anion was electrochemically generated and the spectral and structural changes arising from the conversion were described based on IR spectra and DFT calculations. The structural variations, electron charge distribution over molecular fragments and IR fre-quency shifting were discussed. Materials and methodsThe electrochemical generation of the radical anion of nitrofurantoin was carried out in a special CaF2 cell, provided with platinum electrodes build in the polyethyl-ene spacer. 4.5 V were applied to the cathode in the solu-tion cell containing 0.1 mol/l nitrofurantoin and equimo-lar amount of tetraethylammonium bromide in DMSO-d6. Electrochemical generation of the radical anion was con-tinued for a period of 75 min and then the polarity of the electrolysis cell was reversed in order to regenerate the parent compound. The process of nitrofurantoin reduc-tion and regeneration was monitored by recording IR spec-tra in 10 min intervals. The IR spectra were measured on a Brucker Tensor 27 FT spectrometer at a resolution of 2 cm-1 and 64 scans. All theoretical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package of programs. Geometry and vibra-tional frequencies of species studied were performed by analytical gradient technique without any symmetry con-straint. All the results were obtained using the density func-tional theory (DFT), employing the B3LYP (Becke's three-parameter non-local exchange correlation) method in con-junction with 6-311+G(2df,p) basis set. In order to account for the ifluence of the medium, we used the Integral Equa-tion Formalism Polarizable Continuum Model (IEF-PCM) on the same level of theory with inclusion of DMSO.Results and discussionThe initial IR spectrum of nitrofurantion in DMSO-d6 solution, containing tetraethylammonium bromide as S2 PP 112242Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 241 - 242 (2016)Pharmaceutical analysis / Quality assurance / Regulatory affairsPoster presentationselectrolyte salt, showed that the asymmetric and symmet-ric stretching vibrations of the nitro group are observed at 1521 and 1350 cm-1. The stretching vibration of the N-C bond linking the nitro group to the furan ring is found at rather high wavenumber - 1211 cm-1, respectively. A few minutes after applying the current, the solution in cathode space became brown, and the bands of the anion radical of nitrofurantoin appeared in the IR spectrum. More pro-longed electrolysis (75 min) caused strong increase of the bands of the anion radical, while the bands of the neutral compound vanished. Reversal in the polarity of the elec-trolysis cell resulted in gradual decrease of the IR bands of the radical anion and reappearance of the neutral mole-cule absorptions. After 75 min of reversed electrolysis the initial spectrum of the parent compound was completely restored without the presence of any additional IR bands. This fact unambiguously demonstrates that the observed spectral changes are due to the reduction of nitrofurantoin to radical anion and not to other chemical transformations.The conversion of nitrofurantoin into radical anion is related to strong frequency decreases in the assymetric N-O stretching: Dnas(NO2) = 220 cm-1, strong frequency decreases in the symetric N-O stretching: Dns(NO2) = 209 cm-1 and strong frequency increase in C-NO2 stretching: Dn(C-NO2) = 273 cm-1. Based on the calculated spin den-sity, the odd electron is localized mainly on the nitro group (c.a. 70%) and in smaller extends - on the furan ring (c.a. 30%). The radical anion formation leads to simultaneous shortening of the C-N bond and lengthening of the N-O bonds.ConclusionThe observed frequency shifts arising from the con-version of nitrofurantoin into radical anion are larger than those found with the conversion of dinitrobenzenes and cy-anobenzonitriles. It is evidence that larger structural vari-ations in the nitrofuran moiety occur upon conversion into radical anion than in case of dinitrobenzenes and nitroben-zonitriles. The localization of the spin density over the ni-tro group is a sign for high reactivity of the formed nitro-furantoin radical anion and strong ability to initiate pro-duction of various ROS via electron donation. The impor-tance of aminohydantoin moiety for the stability and reac-tivity of the nitrofurantoin radical anion has to be elucidat-ed by studying other nitrofuran derivatives with modified side chains.Acknowledgements The financial support of this work by the National Sci-ence Fund of Bulgaria (Contracts RNF01/0110), Science Fund is gratefully acknowledged.ReferencesBoelsterli, U.A., Ho, H.K., Zhou, S., Leow, K.Y., 2006.

Generally, its treatment is based on immunosuppressive drugs. Azathioprine is thiopurine metabolite with immuno-suppressive and cytotoxic effects, which is used in the treat-ment of inflammatory bowel disease and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Unfortunately, about one third of patients under azathioprine therapy, have need for modify-ing or terminating the treatment because of adverse effects or low therapeutic outcome. As a prodrug of 6- mercapto-purine (6-MP), azathioprine acts through the formation of thioguanine and methylthioinosine nucleotides, which are capable of incorporating in DNA strains like "false" bases (Dervieux and Boulieu, 1998). Hence the immunosuppres-sive effect, target cells of azathioprine main metabolites - 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN) and 6-methylmercapto-purine (6-MMP) are the "fast-growing" cells, mainly lym-phocytes, though the bone marrow and the hepatic cells are not excluded. Consequently, the risk-benefit ratio of azathi-oprine therapy is dose-dependent and here lies the crucial need for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) (Vikingsson, 2012). On the other hand, intra- and inter-individual varia-tions seem to reflect individual differences in 6-MP absorp-tion and metabolism, resulting in different bioavailability and distribution of the active metabolites in patients receiv-ing similar doses. The purpose of this study is to establish a specific, sensitive HPLC method for simultaneous deter-mination of 6-TGN and 6-MMP found in erythrocytes af-ter azathioprine administration. Materials and methodsChemicals and reagents. 6-MMP, 6-TGN and dithio-threitol (DTT- derivatization agent) were purchased form Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, USA. Methanol, phosphate buffer (pH 3,5), perchloric acid, hydrochloric acid, all HPLC grade, were obtained from Merck, Darmstadt, Ger-many. For all analysis, HPLC grade water was used. Zorb-ax Eclipse XDB C18 column, 150 x 4.5mm, 5 mm was sup-plied by Agilent Technologies. Erythrocyte samples. Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers (used for method validation) and from patients under azathioprine therapy (used like testing samples). Erythrocytes were extracted by centrifugation at 4 degS. Further on, the eppendorf tubes were normalized on 4kh109 erythrocytes, and frozen at -80 degS until the analysis.Preparation of standard solutions. Stock solution of the analytes (5 mg/ml 6-TGN and 40 mg/ml 6-MMR) were pre-pared by dissolving each compound in 0,1 M HCl. Work-ing solutions were prepared in 6 different concentrations (concentration range between 0,04 mg/ml to 2,50 mg/ml for 6-TGN and 0,25 mg/ml to 20 mg/ml for 6-MMR) from stock solutions by dilution with 0,1 M HCl. Calibration stan-dards were made by spiking the blank erythrocytes with appropriate volume of working solutions of 6-TGN and 6-MMP at six different concentration. Samples for qual-ity control (QC) were prepared in 4 different concentra-tions that cover the range of the calibration curve (LLOQ, low QC, medium QC, high QC appropriate for 6-TGN and 6-MMP). Sample preparation. Sample solutions were made by adding DTT in each eppendorf tube which contains 500 ml of erythrocytes from patients under azathioprine therapy. In each eppendorf tube 50 ml 70% Perchloric acid (acid hy-drolysis and deproteinization agent) was added and centri-fuged at 3000 rpm, for 15 minutes at 4 degC.

Acid superna-tants were collected and heated at 100 degC for 45 minutes in order to release thiopurine bases after hydrolysis. Chromatographic conditions. The separation was car-ried out with Agilent 1100 HPLC system on Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18, 150 x 4.5mm, 5mm column using gradient elu-tion with methanol and phosphate buffer (pH 3,5) in ratio 5:95 (V/V) with linear gradient to 15:85 (V/V) for a period of 12 minutes and flow rate of 1,2 ml/min. The temperature was set at 25 degC with UV detection at 341 nm for 6-TGN and 304 nm for 6-MMP. Method was validated following the recommendations for validation of bioanalytical meth-ods of EMA guideline (Guideline on validation of bioana-lytical methods, European Medicines Agency, 2011). Results and discussionThe recovery values of the extraction procedure were higher than 84% for both metabolites, 6-TGN and 6-MMP. Under the proposed chromatographic conditions, no inter-fering peaks were observed in the retention time of analyt-es. The correlation coefficient from calibration curves for linearity of the method was 0.9996 for 6-TGN and 0.9989 for 6-MMP, respectively. The results for accuracy (+-15% of the nominal values for the QC samples and +- 20% of the nominal value for the LLOQ) and precision (the val-ue for coefficient of variation should not exceed 15% for QC samples and 20% for LLOQ) were within recommend-ed limits. Stability studies indicated that no stability relat-ed problems would be expected during the routine erythro-cytes sample analysis.
