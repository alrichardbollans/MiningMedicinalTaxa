In addition, screening with in vitro assays has little meaning if there is no clear evi-dence of the effectiveness of the extracts in vivo. There-fore, it is suggested that further studies are to be performed in order to evaluate the in vivo effects of these extracts.ReferencesElmastas, M., G.

These variations may occur rapidly at critical points in the life cycle, such as during the neonatal period, childhood, puberty, menopause, or old age. Biological variation has an important effect on the interpretation of all laboratory investigations, including triglycerides and cholesterol (Fraser, 2001).Biological variation, i.e., the normal day-to-day variation of cholesterol is within the range of 3-5%. Many studies have also documented a seasonal variation. Although there is a discordance between the studies, cholesterol levels tend to be higher in winter and lower during the summer months independent of the country of origin, ethnicity, age, sex, and baseline lipids. The seasonal variation has been reported to be as high as 12% (Deeg, 2006). Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in humans and animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transfer of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils.Cholesterol is a sterol (or modified steroid), a lipid molecule that is biosynthesized by all animal cells because it is an essential structural component of all cell membranes required to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. It enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall to protect membrane integrity and cell viability.Cholesterol and triglycerides, like many other essential components of the body, attract clinical attention when present in abnormal concentrations. For the diagnosis of different lipoprotein disorders, one can usually rely on simple plasma values of total cholesterol and triglycerides. Obtained lipid values will be interpreted in relation to age and gender according to reference values (Mula-Abed et al, 2008). MethodsAnalysis of serum total cholesterol and triglycerides is usually performed on blood specimens collected by the standard procedure. Fasting venous blood was collected at 8-10 am following an overnight fast, from apparently healthy participants (men and women, aged 15-67 years). The specimens were collected in 1-year period. Serum TG and total cholesterol were measured by enzymatic methods using kits from Biosystems (Spain) and biochemistry analyzer Mindray BS-200. Cholesterol was assayed by the cholesterol esterase/cholesterol oxidase/4-aminophenazone/phenol method and the triglycerides by glycerol phosphate oxidase/peroxidase method (Biosystems, 2012)Standard statistical methods were used or the analysis of data. The mean and SD were calculated for each parameter of serum triglycerides and cholesterol from each participant. The data was inspected for any outlier (defined as values outside +- 3 SD from the mean). There was no outlier and all results were within the mean value +- 2 SD. ResultsThe study was conducted with cholesterol samples from 210 apparently healthy participants with mean of 5.22+-1.85 (Coefficient of variation (CV) 17.73%) and triglycerides samples from 204 participants with mean of 1.56+-1.54 (CV 49.46%). These results were divided for observation in groups by age and gender.

From these groups 5 groups were made for observation by gender. The obtained results from the participants were compared with the reference values provided by the used kits manufacturer (Biosystems, 2012).The results from cholesterol measurements follows:Group 1, N=26, x=5.11+-1.76 (CV 17.19%); Group 2, N=21, x=4.87+-1.6 (CV 16.46%); Group 3, N=23, x=5.37+-1.84 (CV 17.2%); Group 4, N=21, x=5.00+-1.76 (CV 17.67%); Group 5, N=20, x=5.58+-1.92 (CV 17.24%); Group 6, N=20, x=5.25+-1.06 (CV 20.19%); Group 7, N=21, x=5.27+-2.16 (CV 20.5%); Group 8, N=20, x=5.57+-1.12 (CV 10.1%); Group 9, N=21, x=5.15+-2.22 (CV 21.53%); Group 10, N=17, x=4.99+-1.5 (CV 14.97%).The results from triglycerides measurements follows:Group 1, N=24, x=1.57+-1,7 (CV 54.12%); Group 2, N=22, x=1.16+-1.0 (CV 43.37%); Group 3, N=22, x=1.94+-1.06 (CV 27.53%); Group 4, N=21, x=1.20+-1.7 (CV 70.71%); Group 5, N=17, x=1.96+-1.58 (CV 40.64%); Group 6, N=18, x=1.40+-1.8 (CV 64.65%); Group 7, N=20, x=1.72+-1.86 (CV 54.13%); Group 8, N=21, x=1.73+-1.26 (CV 36.36%); Group 9, N=20, x=1.33+-1.08 (CV 40.38%); Group 10, N=19, x=1.66+-1.48 (CV 44.39%).DiscussionBiological variation has an important effect on the in-terpretation of different laboratory investigations, includ-ing triglycerides and cholesterol. There is also a growing interest in evaluating the cut-off limits for the desirable thresholds of serum cholesterol and triglycerides accord-ing to different recommendations and clinical trials, with a trend is towards lowering these limits.The inter-individual variations for cholesterol are 17.73% and for triglycerides are 49.46%. The study by Ford (1989) had reported an inter-individual variation 17.3% for cholesterol, which is in agreement with the val-ues observed in our study. The range of variability in serum lipid profile between individuals in this study for cholester-ol is 4.3-6.14 mmol/L, but according to the kit documenta-tion cholesterol level should be lower than 5.2 mmol/L and for triglycerides this range is between 0.79-2.33 mmol/L (lower than 1.7 mmol/L declared in the kit documentation).ConclusionFrom the data for cholesterol, with the usage of t-test, we can conclude that there are no significant differences in the results between different age groups and gender, but there is a significance in results for triglycerides (p<0,05) between participants with age of 15-49 in both male and female groups. The study should be widened with imple-menting analytical variation and intra-individual data.Extensive medical research has identified hyperlipid-emia as a major risk factor for heart disease with an estab-lished clinical correlation between hyperlipidemia and the incidence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). The impor-tance of this study is detection of sudden changes in lipid values that may indicate a change in diet, medications, or onset of a new disease state.ReferencesBiosystems, S.A., 2012.

Also gender in various analytes can play an important role. In our study we made a comparison between different age groups, gender and reference range for creatinine and urea in serum (Cvitkovic and Mesic,1999).Creatinine is a chemical waste molecule that is produced when muscles use creatine, another naturally occurring product in the body, to create energy. About 2% of creatine is converted to creatinine each day. Most of the waste creatinine is expelled from the body in the urine (Hosten, 1990). The creatinine level measured for an individual should be relatively constant over time and should be within a "normal" range. The creatinine level is one of the main indicators of kidney function. If the creatinine level is elevated, the patient should be further evaluated for other signs of kidney disease and renal problems. Normal creatinine level ranges will depend on age, gender and other health factors (Taylor, 1989).Blood urea nitrogen, known by the simple initials BUN is the measurement of urea nitrogen levels in the blood. Urea nitrogen is naturally produced by the liver as a waste product of digested protein. After production, urea is transported to the kidneys where it is excreted from the blood stream. The BUN test is therefore conducted to determine how much urea nitrogen is still present in the blood, and this test mainly determines if the kidneys renal functions are working as they should. There are many factors that could bring about high or low levels of BUN.BUN and creatinine tests are often used together to determine the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine. The BUN to creatinine ratio ultimately helps the physician to find the cause of the poor kidney function and the causes may vary from dehydration to malnutrition or kidney failure.MethodsAnalysis of serum creatinine and urea was performed on blood specimens collected by the standard procedure. Fasting venous blood was collected at 8-10 am following an overnight fast, from apparently healthy participants (men and women, aged 15-65 years). The specimens were collected in a period of one year. Serum creatinine and urea were measured by enzymatic methods using kits and from Biosystems (Spain) and the biochemistry analyzer Mindray BS-200. Creatinine was assayed by picrate in alkaline medium forming colored complex, Jaffe method (Fabiny and Ertingshausen, 1971) and urea by urease/glutamate dehydrogenase method (Gutmann and Bergmeyer, 1974).Standard statistical methods were used or the analysis of data. The mean and SD were calculated for each parameter of serum creatinine and urea from each participant. The data were inspected for any outlier (defined as values outside +- 3 SD from the mean). There was no outlier and all results were within the mean +- 2 SD.ResultsThe study was conducted with creatinine samples from 220 apparently healthy participants with mean value of 74.19+-23.22 (coefficient of variation (CV) 15.64%) and urea samples from 217 participants with mean of 4,88+-1,31 (CV 26,94%). These samples results were divided for observation in groups by age and gender. There are 10 groups with number of participants: Group 1 - 15-29 years male, Group 2 - 15-29 years female, Group S3 PP 153326Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 325 - 326 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentations3 - 30-39 years male, Group 4 - 30-39 years female, Group 5 - 40-49 years male, Group 6 - 40-49 years female, Group 7 - 50-59 years male, Group 8 - 50-59 years female, Group 9 - 60-65 years male and Group 10 - 60-65 years female.
