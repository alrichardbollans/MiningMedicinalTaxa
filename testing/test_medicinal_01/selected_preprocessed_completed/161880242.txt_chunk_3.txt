SharifuddinChapter 1supplements rather than medicines mainly for regulatory purposes, effectively the public in many cases are unable to differentiate phytomedicines for dietary supplements or therapeutic applications. A report by the Mintel market research group on retail sales of licensed homeopathic, herbal remedies and essential oils showed that phytomedicines make up more than 50% of the total complementary market in the United Kingdom with estimated value of PS38 million in 1996 compared to PS27.2 million in 1991 (Mintel, 1997). However, the total market value is likely to be higher since the study excluded ginkgo and unlicensed herbal products from its analysis.Another report estimated the phytomedicines market to be over PS60 million (Mintel, 2000).More recent reports estimated the market value of herbal remedies (excluding traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines) had grown to PS75 million in 2002, dominating the UK natural health market and accounting for almost 60% of the sector value (Mintel, 2003).Another Mintel report in 2005 noted that herbal medicines have shown greatest growth over the last two years with value sales hitting PS87 million in 2004, accounting for half of overall category sales. All these estimates should be considered as broad brush since some companies might not always have an accurate view as to which of their products would be classified as medicines.The analysis of the market structure for unlicensed phytomedicines is complicated by several factors such as:* Most phytomedicines possess borderline status as to whether they should be categorised as medicines or fall within other regulatory classification such as supplements, cosmetics or general consumer products. * A number of companies supply herbal ingredients (e.g. for herbalists' use or by manufacturers) rather than manufacture the product themselves. * Under existing regulations, companies are not required to submit products to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for determining their status.One must recognised the fact that future growth in the industry remains vulnerable to adverse publicity arising from issues over the safety and quality of phytomedicines.Copy 1 10Y. SharifuddinChapter 11.3 The Regulation of Phytomedicines in the United Kingdom and the European UnionThe House of Lord's Select Committee on Science and Technology 6th report (2000) stressed for a need of a more effective guidance to the public regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicines. The absence of central information provision for healthcare practitioners and the general public, effectively gave the media and other unregulated information sources unchecked influence in shaping opinions in the field. Over 25% of consumers believed that pharmacists should provide more information on herbal medicines highlighting increasing consumer concern, with about 20% of consumers worried about the possible side-effects from alternative medications (Mintel, 2003).Whilst the government and the industry need to address this consumer concern, Mintel's report also found that around 1 in 5 UK consumers worry about the possible side effects from standard medication too. And 18% admitted they have tried conventional medicine which did not work, suggesting a significant opening for the phytomedicine industry (Mintel, 2003).Phytomedicines intended for general retail sale reach the UK market by two different routes. First, an authorisation can be obtained from the licensing authority for marketing purposes under the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisation Use) Regulations 1994 (SI3144/1994) that fundamentally transposed European Directive 2001/83/EC into UK law. Under these Regulations, authorisation is requisite for most industrially produced medicines that are to be marketed. Such authorisation is obtained by providing standards of quality, efficacy and safety.Alternatively, exemption from product licence requirement (compulsory under the Medicines Act) can be obtained under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 [and regulation 1(3) of the 1994 Regulations] for phytomedicines that do not need marketing authorisation, providing that the remedy meets various conditions. There are restrictions or prohibitions on certain ingredients, but generally there are no specific requirements for quality, safety and efficacy. Written medical claims are not permitted for these herbal remedies and specific requirement to provide the consumers with systematic information about the safe application of the product is absent.Copy 1 11Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Even though several hundred phytomedicines posses marketing permission in the UK, most herbal medicines were marketed on general sale by utilising the exemption provided in Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act as explained above.The primary piece of European legislation is Directive 2001 /83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code regarding medicinal products intended for human use. Thus, there was no distinction in the European legislation for medicines made from non-herbal ingredients and phytomedicine. Medicinal products are also subjected to some non-specific legislation, such as Directive 85/374/EEC on product viability, which was transposed into the UK law as Consumer Protection Act 1987 and applies in part to medicinal products for consumer protection.On 30th October 2005, the MHRA introduced a new scheme, the Traditional Herbal Medicines Registration Scheme implemented through the Medicines (Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2005 (SI 2005 No. 2750), which is required by the European Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products 2004/24/EC. This scheme will assist in protecting public health, consumer confidence and the industry itself by requiring specific standards to be met relating to the product namely quality, safety, manufacturing standards, patient information, wholesale and import. However, the key feature of this scheme is the requirement for evidence of traditional application in the EU for 30 years. Evidence for up to 15 years of traditional applications outside the Union is admissible. This new EU Directive effectively amends Directive 2001/83/EC, to introduce the scheme and applies many existing requirements of the later to traditional herbal medicinal products. Another separate new EU Directive 2004/27/EC is simultaneously amending Directive 2001/83/EC. All manufactured traditional herbal medicines that marketed with exemption under Section 12(2) of the Medicines Act, will be required to be registered under this new scheme.However, for unlicensed herbal medicines that were legally on the market by 30 April 2004, Her Majesty's Government has opted for a seven-year transitional period that ends on 30 April 2011, a flexibility accorded to EU member States under Directive 2004/24/EC intended to allow companies to adjust to the new regulations.Copy 1 12Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Herbal products that are not classified as medicines are still subject to other regulations. The fact that a product is not medicinal in nature thus not necessarily means that it is safe or acceptable from a legal standpoint. Food and supplements are regulated by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) while cosmetics or other consumer products fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Trade and Industry. The MHRA accepts no responsibilities on these points. The Food Safety Act (1990) states that food sold in the United Kingdom cannot be injurious to health and according to the FSA, herbal ingredients that do not possess a history of significant consumption within the European Union prior to May 1997 may be subject to Novel Food Regulation (EC) 258/97.1.4 The Importance of Natural Products and PhytomedicinesNatural products have enjoyed an undisputedly important role as new chemical entities (NCEs). Between the years 1981 and 2002, approximately 28% of NCEs were natural products or derived from natural products, with another 20% were considered as synthetics based on natural product pharmacophores (Newman et al., 2003).Natural products (phytochemicals) have many common structural features such as chiral centres, degree of molecule saturation, complex ring systems and aromatic rings that have been demonstrated to be highly applicable in drug discovery process (Koehn & Carter, 2005). Furthermore, the realisation that combinatorial chemistry may not always provide high degree of compound diversity led to the exploration of combining the natural product and natural product-like libraries with the potential of combinatorial chemistry in drug discovery and Table 1.3 shows some of the well-known phytochemicals in use today.The existence and application of new technologies such as combinatorial synthesis, genomics and screening technology allow new research and development strategies to be adopted and contributed to revival of interest in phytochemicals. Table 1.4 listed some phytochemicals with their known molecular targets which might pave the way for better comprehension on their mode of action(s) and possible development into clinically applicable drugs.Copy 1 13Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Table 1.3.

In May 2007, another pharmaceutical heavyweight, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) announced the establishment of its own drug research and development facility in Shanghai, China (Corporate Press Releases,Copy I1 4Y. SharifuddinChapter 1Novartis and GSK respectively, 2007). Embracing phytochemicals again and re-designing strategies for discovering new molecules from plants including studying those described in traditional medicine texts such as in China, is understandable since the new chemical entities pipeline of pharmaceutical companies were reported to be at historically low levels (Bolten & DeGregorio, 2002).1.5 The Efficacy of PhytomedicinesThe extraordinary level of phytomedicines popularity in recent years made it ethically imperative to elucidate its efficacy. There were opinions that the criteria for efficacy as well as safety of herbal medicines should be on par as those for conventional medicines and the author concur with these views. Many phytomedicines possess a long history of traditional use but most are of unproven efficacy by acceptable scientific standards, and traditional use does not necessarily confer safety usage mark. Insufficient evidence does not mean that phyomedicines are unsafe and ineffective, but that rigorous scientific investigation has not been carried out. Base on the same line of argument, the lack of evidence cannot be use to justify that all phytomedicines are safe.The accepted 'gold standard' for testing the efficacy of medicines, whether it is synthetic or herbal, is the randomised clinical trials. Depending on the research objectives, these trials can be conducted against reference medications should one exists, or against placebo or no treatment at all. There is good evidence of efficacy for some phytomedicines but usually such an evaluation is scientifically inadequate. Figure 1.6 shows the percentage of randomised clinical trials highlighting the benefit of phytomedicines based on 50 trials with 10 herbal medicines for 18 therapeutic indications, where only 34% exhibited benefit when compared against placebo and 18% showed the same activity as placebo. Almost half (48%) of the results from the trials has an unlikely benefit due to discrepancies in experimental design or data analysis.Copy 7 15Y.

Percentage o f randomised trials showing benefit o f phytomedicines. Based on data in Herbal Medicines: an evidence-based look. (Therapeutics Letter, Issue 25, June-July 1998. )However, in order to provide a fair estimate of overall efficacy of a particular herbal medication, relying on the data generated from randomised trials alone is not sufficient. Only the totality of the available data that can be achieved by performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses can provide the most reliable evidence while minimising bias and random error. Determining the efficacy of an herbal product against its safety is important.1.6 Safety of Phytomedicines: Clear and Hidden RisksThe advances in organic chemistry, biological and medical sciences in the 20th century had paved the way for the introduction and consumption of powerful synthetic drugs, resulting in the decline of phytomedicines usage in modern medicine. However, the current revival of interest in phytotherapy had caused the pharmaceutical industry to start marketing an increasing amount o f new phytomedicines to accommodate the needs o f consumers. This makes the need to ensure the quality, efficacy and safety of phytomedicines even more pressing since these products are generally self-prescribed, used to treat minor and oftenCopy /1 6Y. SharifuddinChapter 1chronic conditions. The assumption that they only possess beneficial effects has proven to be inaccurate.Furthermore, traditional medicines have developed in many different regions, having been very much influenced by historical conditions and local cultures within which they first evolved. Thus, there has been no parallel development of methods and standards, both at national or international level that are suitable for evaluation purposes.Safety evaluation of phytomedicines is difficult. Identifying plants accurately is essential as well as isolation of active ingredients, which is far more complex since the properties of phytochemicals are influenced by several factors such as environmental conditions. A single medicinal plant can also contain hundreds of phytochemicals and elucidating the individual effect of each can therefore be prohibitively expensive. Unsurprisingly, research effort has been inadequate, resulting in inadequate methodology development and paucity of reliable data. Although many phytomedicines showed promising potential and are increasingly used, many of them are untested and their use by the public not properly monitored leading to limited knowledge of their side-effects. Benefit-risk assessment can also be difficult due to insufficient information in several areas relevant to safety.
