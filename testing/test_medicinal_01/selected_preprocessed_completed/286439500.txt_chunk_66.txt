Theidentification was based on the mass spectra of the compounds(Grosso et al., 2014). In stems, leaves, and flowers, 5'-methoxy-flavonol [43] and 6'- methoxy-flavonol [44] were also detected(Stancic-Rotaru et al., 2003).Hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic) andtheir derivatives ((-)-2-(E)-caffeoyl-D-glyceric acid [46], (-)-4-(E)-caffeoyl-L-threonic acid [47], (-)-2-(E)-caffeoyl-L-threonicacid lactone, (+)-(E)-caffeoyl-L-malic acid [48]), as well ashydroxybenzoic acids (genistic, p-hydroxybenzoic) wereidentified in aerial parts (Hahn and Nahrstedt, 1993; Wojdyloet al., 2007). Later, another three hydroxycinnamic acids wereidentified using HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS: caffeoyl threonic acid,caffeoyl glyceric acid, caffeoylmalic acid (Grosso et al., 2014), thathave been detected previously by Hahn and Nahrstedt (1993).Two caffeoyl acid derivatives isomers with precursor ions at m/s359 corresponding to rosmarinic acid were also found in aerialparts (Grosso et al., 2014).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299171Zielin'ska et al.

Whether or not the presenceof cystatin is relevant to the medicinal properties and suchtraditional folk uses as anti-warts is yet to be found out.In a series of papers, Nawrot et al. (2007a,b, 2008, 2013,2014, 2016, 2017a,b) described a number of proteins from rootand leaf latex. Proteomic analysis using LC-ESI-MS/MS systemrevealed the presence of three categories of proteins accordingto their functions: proteins involved in disease and defensesresponses (i.e., superoxide dismutases, lactoylglutathione lyases),nucleic acid binding proteins (i.e., glycine-rich proteins, nucleicacid binding, DNA-binding, or RNA-binding proteins), andthese that are involved in general metabolism (acyl-CoAbinding protein, malate dehydrogenase, flavodoxin-like quinonereductase, ubiquitin, polyubiquitin, serine/threonine proteinkinases, rubber elongation factor). A total of 21 proteins wereidentified in C. majus latex, although in several cases theidentification was based on correlation between experimentaland the theoretical pI/molecular mass, due to their low scoreresults.

Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majusFIGURE 7 | Structures of miscellaneous compounds.METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF ACTIVECOMPONENTS FROM Chelidonium majusAlkaloidsFirst isolation of Chelidonium alkaloids was achieved innineteenth century with an important contribution from Mr.Emanuel Merck's company at Darmstadt (Henschke, 1888;Schmidt, 1888) and obtaining and characterization of purecompounds (chelidonine [1], chelerythrine [9], protopine [37])was successful in the following years (Selle, 1890; Wintgen andSchmidt, 1901). Alkaloids of C. majus occur as salts or basesdepending on pH of medium; thus, their extraction was mostlycarried out in acidic condition to convert all compounds towater-soluble salts. Methanol or ethanol often with additionof water (Bugatti et al., 1987; Han et al., 1991; Koriem et al.,2013) and hydrochloric (Kursinszki et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2010)or acetic acid (Paulsen et al., 2015) were used as extractants.The isolation from plant material was also achieved with theuse of pure acidified water; further, the solution was alkalizedwith ammonia or sodium hydroxide to obtain base formsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299175Zielin'ska et al.

The isolation wasconducted by percolation (Capistrano et al., 2015), maceration(Koriem et al., 2013; Borghini et al., 2015), heating under reflux(Gu et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2011; Seidler-Lozykowska et al.,2016), in water bath (Sa-rkozi et al., 2006) or Soxhlet apparatus(Bugatti et al., 1987; Stuppner and Ganzera, 1995) as well asultrasound assisted (UAE) (Kursinszki et al., 2006; Sarkozi et al.,2007; Paulsen et al., 2015; Jesionek et al., 2016) or microwaveenergy (MAE) (Then et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2012). Supercriticalfluid extraction (SFE) (Then et al., 2000) or SFE combined withenhanced solvent extraction (ESE) and low pressure solventextraction with water (LPSE) (Ganan et al., 2016) was alsoapplied. Moreover, in situ solvent formation microextraction(ISFME) with the use of ion-pairing agent (KPF6) and awater-miscible ionic liquid ([C6MIM][Br]) which formed ahydrophobic ionic liquid extraction phase ([C6MIM]PF6) forthe pre-concentration of sanguinarine [12] and chelerythrine[9] was elaborated by Wu and Du (2012). After extraction, thesolution was usually filtrated through a 0.22-um membrane (Guet al., 2010) or additionally purified using solid phase extraction(SPE) on C18 cartridge (Stuppner and Ganzera, 1995; Kursinszkiet al., 2006; Sa-rkozi et al., 2006). Sa-rkozi et al. (2006) developedion-pair SPE with n-heptanesulfonic acid (HS). Dried residueobtained after extraction was dissolved in methanol with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid, diluted with 0.05M aqueous solution of HSand loaded on an SPE C18 microcolumn. Further, 70% HS(0.05M) in methanol was used to remove the matrix and 5%HS (0.05M) in methanol to elute analytes. The examples ofconditions used to isolate alkaloids from C. majus are presentedin Supplementary Table 1.Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)TLC was mostly employed for screening purposes or forqualitative analysis of alkaloid composition in C. majus extracts.This technique has been largely limited to the screening andmultiple sample fingerprinting, but usually does not enable high-sensitivity or high-resolution insight into the minor componentsof the phytochemical profile. Despite of being less intensivelymodernized in comparison to column-based techniques like(U)HPLC, this method is still favored when cost-effectivenessand simplicity of sample preparation is important, for example inherbal industries and educational use. Some recent developmentsin mass spectrometry hyphenation in form of matrix transferor DART (direct analysis in real time) used already in studyingof other species (Moricz et al., 2018) should be useful also forC. majus alkaloids.Silica was the most common stationary phase, oftenimpregnated with salts (Ni, Zn, Cr, Co) to improve the selectivity(Wagner et al., 1984; Then et al., 2000; Waksmundzka-Hajnoset al., 2000; Sa-rkozi et al., 2006; Sarkozi et al., 2007; Petruczyniket al., 2008; Jesionek et al., 2016) Silica modified with octadecyl(C-18) and cyanopropyl (CN) groups and aqueous solutions ofmethanol or isopropanol with ammonia or diethylamine whichprevented tailing of chromatographic bands were sporadicallyapplied (Petruczynik et al., 2007). Petruczynik et al. (2008)combined various types of stationary phases e.g., cyanopropylsilica with silica or octadecyl silica to obtain adsorbent gradient.Apart from the routine isocratic elution with solventmixtures, using different modes of gradient elution improved theseparation, e.g., as a two-dimensional or unidimensional multipledevelopment (Szumilo and Flieger, 1999; Waksmundzka-Hajnoset al., 2000; Migas et al., 2012), bivariant multiple development(Bogucka-Kocka and Zalewski, 2017), or stepwise gradientelution (Matysik and Jusiak, 1990; Waksmundzka-Hajnos et al.,Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299176Zielin'ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majus2000; Bogucka-Kocka and Zalewski, 2017). TLC separation ofalkaloids was supported by use of magnetic field (Malinowskaet al., 2017) or forced flow of mobile phase (OPLC--overpressure layer chromatography or optimum performancelaminar chromatography; Pothier et al., 1993; Malinowska et al.,2005).TLC was also applied for direct bioautography (TLC-DB) totest the antibacterial activity of C. majus extracts (Sarkozi et al.,2007; Moricz et al., 2015; Jesionek et al., 2016) combined withdensitometry for quantitative analysis (Then et al., 2000; Sa-rkoziet al., 2006) and it proved useful as preparative technique forisolation of alkaloids (Waksmundzka-Hajnos et al., 2002; Koriemet al., 2013).High Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC)High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-fast liquid chromatography (UFLC) have been the most oftenapplied analytical techniques. For many years, separation ofC. majus extracts was mostly carried out in reversed phase(RP) system using long (150 or 250mm) C18 columns with4.6mm of diameter and 5um of particle size (Niu and He, 1994;Petruczynik et al., 2002; Kursinszki et al., 2006; Borghini et al.,2015; Paulsen et al., 2015; Ganan et al., 2016). More recently,adsorbents with smaller particles (<=3um) or shorter columns(Prosen and Pendry, 2016; Seidler-Lozykowska et al., 2016) werealso applied to achieve shorter separation and saving solvents.Mobile phases are usually composed of water and acetonitrileor/and methanol with various additives e.g., ammoniumformate/acetate (Borghini et al., 2015; Seidler-Lozykowska et al.,2016), organic amines (triethyl-, tetrabutylamine) (Paulsen et al.,2015), ion-pair reagents (sodiumdodecylsulfate, alkylsulfonicacids) (Ganan et al., 2016).
