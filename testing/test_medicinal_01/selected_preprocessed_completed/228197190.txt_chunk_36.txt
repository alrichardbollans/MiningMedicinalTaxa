Start date for the project: Expected end date for the project: (FREC/RCO must be advised upon completion) 01/10/2012 October 2016 Brief description of proposed activity and its objectives: The tulsi project has emerged as a satellite project, which has developed during the initial stages of my PhD. Extensive background research done suggests that this plant (Ocimum tenuiflorum) has multiple medicinal benefits, huge cultural significance and would be a great starting point to develop my biomolecular analytical skills. From this project we anticipate collecting a variety of tulsi samples from participants, whether it be tulsi seeds to grow in the growth room, leaves (fresh/dry) or any other tulsi product which we can extract DNA from. These will be added to the current traditional herbal medicines inventory we have in the university. At the same time as collecting samples of tulsi we will ask participants a few questions, a semi-structured interview, about their tulsi. Questions will aim to gain an insight into where their tulsi is from, why it is kept, what it is used for and any other significant facts about the plant. Please see the attached proposal for further information*. *Please refer to the external memory device for the complete Tulsi Project Ethical Proposal 244 Sukvinder Kaur Bhamra Ethical issues identified: How these will be addressed: Confidentiality & anonymity.
