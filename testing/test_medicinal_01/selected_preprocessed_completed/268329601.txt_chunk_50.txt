PURPOSEFUL USE OFTOXIC PLANTS"We did not escape without damage because [theIndians] killed another companion of ours ... and intruth, the arrow did not penetrate half a finger, but asit had poison on it, he gave up his soul to our Lord. "(Francisco de Orellana, 1541)We have knowingly used poisonous plants asinstruments of punishment, torture, murder, andsuicide. As interesting as some of these episodesmight be, they are not the subject of this section. Iwant to concentrate instead on our use of plant toxinsin arrow poisons, in the little-known ritual known asthe "ordeal," and on their use to kill fish, insects, androdents.ARROW & DART POISONSPeoples of both the Old World and the New Worldhave used many different plants in the preparation ofthese poisons. Native Americans on this continentused relatively few arrow poisons from plant sources,relying instead on rattlesnake venom and the juices ofthe black widow spider. The Indians of South Americaand the tribesmen of Africa used arrow poisons bothto hunt wild game and in wars against their enemies.CURARE. This is probably the most famous arrowpoison. The name is a phonetic rendering of an Indianphrase meaning, "He, to whom it comes, falls." Otherspellings used in the literature are urari, woorari,woorali, and wourali. Curare is the name for a wholegroup of arrow poisons used in South America. Thefact that the ingredients and their relative proportionsvary from one location to the next hindered any realunderstanding of the botanical and chemical nature ofthe poison.The Baron Alexander von Humboldt was probably thefirst European to witness the preparation of curare. Hewrote that the Indians shredded bark of certain treesand made an infusion from it. This was furtherconcentrated by boiling it. Several other plantmaterials were added to the mixture.The Indians have several different ways of assayingthe strength of curare. One is to wound a frog with apoisoned arrow or dart. If it can jump more than eighttimes without the curare taking effect, then the potionis deemed too weak. Another test involves a monkeyjumping from tree to tree. When the curare is at itsproper strength, an animal should not be able to jumpto more than one tree before the toxin takes effect.And, a final test is that since the honor of preparingcurare often falls to the old women of the tribe, if theyare not half intoxicated by the fumes of the boilingmixture, the brew is not yet ready.The exact botanical nature of curare is still in somedoubt. The two principal toxic ingredients areStrychnos spp. (often S. toxifera) of the Logan-iaceaeand Chondrodendron tomentosum of the moonseedfamily (Menispermaceae).Three basic groups or kinds of curare are oftenrecognized, based upon the physical form in whichthey are prepared. Tubocurare, also known as tubecurare or bamboo curare, is cylindrical, having beenpacked in hollow bamboo stems. The two other kindsare gourd or calabash curare and pot curare.Chondrodendron is the principal ingredient in tubecurare; it is also used in pot curare. Strychnos is usedin both calabash and pot curare.The active ingredient is d-tubocurarine chloride ortubocurarine chloride, a whitish, odorless powder.Poisoning manifests itself in muscular relaxation byblocking of impulses between the nerve and themuscle fiber activated by it. Symptoms include:' impaired vision' bilateral drooping of lips' heaviness of face' relaxation of jaw' weakness of head muscles' inability to raise head' paralysis of spinal muscles, legs, & arms' slowed respiration, and' death.Curare is rapidly destroyed and excreted. Its actionusually lasts for about 15-20 minutes, during whichthe victim dies. The flesh of animals killed by curaremay be eaten.There are also medicinal uses for curare. Because it isa muscle relaxant, it may be used in the treatment ofconvulsive mental patients and in certain types ofsurgery. Curare is also used to diagnose myastheniagravis, a muscular disorder characterized by an overalldeterioration of muscle tone.KOMBI. The action of this African arrow poison wasfirst described in detail by Dr. David Livingstone, themissionary to Africa of "Dr. Livingstone, I presume"fame. He observed people preparing a poison from thefruits of Strophanthus, a member of Apocynaceae, thedogbane family. The action of kombi is much like thatof curare. The wounded animal rarely runs more thanabout a hundred yards before it falls. Kombi containsstrophanthin, a glycoside with digitalis-like effects. Itmust get into the blood stream, which means that theflesh of kombi victims is edible.Strophanthin also finds limited uses in medicine. It isused on heart attack victims when time is of theutmost importance. It takes effect much faster thandigitalis, but it is such a violent poison that thedosages must be carefully controlled.UPAS. This is an arrow poison used by the natives ofJava. The chief ingredient is Antiaris toxicaria ofMoraceae, the mulberry family.OUABAIN. The natives of tropical Africa prepare anarrow poison from Strophanthus gratus. A somewhatinferior brand can be made from Acokantheraschimperi and A. deflexa. Ouabain is the most rapidlyacting heart-glycoside known.-172-NEW WORLD ARROW & DART POISONSScientific Name (Family) Area of UseAconitum spp. (Buttercup) North AmericaAnemone spp. (Buttercup) North AmericaAnomospermum spp. (Moonseed) South AmericaCapsicum annuum (Nightshade) South AmericaCocculus spp. (Moonseed) South AmericaColliguaja odorifera (Spurge) South AmericaChondrodendron spp. (Moonseed) South AmericaConium maculatum (Parsley) North AmericaCynanchum macrophyllum (Milkweed) N.

The technique is notcomplex. It typically involves putting the required partof a particular plant in a still body of water. The planttoxin is released into the water, numbing the fish sothat it comes floating to the surface.The California buckeye (Aesculus californica) was usedby several tribes of Native Americans. Seeds,sometimes leaves or young stems, were crushed andmade into a mash that was floated on the surface ofthe water. The stupefied fish were then gathered byhand or in nets. The fish poison tree (Piscidia piscipula) of the beanfamily occurs in Texas, Florida, Mexico, the WestIndies, and South America. Its leaves, stems, and rootbark are macerated with a rum distillation residue orlime water. The material is then placed in baskets andfloated in the water until the stupefied fish surface.The plant contains piscidin, a mixture of two toxicglycosides.FISH POISONSScientific & Common Name Where Used ?Aesculus californica (California buckeye) CaliforniaChlorogalum pomeridianum (soaproot) CaliforniaClibadium spp. (Cunambi) AmazonConium maculatum (wasia) MexicoCroton setigerus (turkey mullein) CaliforniaDerris elliptica (tuba-root) AsiaEchinocystis fabacea (manroot) CaliforniaErythrina piscipula South AmericaHura crepitans (oassucu) South AmericaLomatium dissectum CaliforniaLonchocarpus spp. (barbasco) Tropical AmericaLycopus spp. (horehound) CaliforniaManihot esculenta (cassava) GuianaPatinoa sphaerocarpa AmazonPaullinia spp. (timbo) South AmericaPhyllanthus spp. South AmericaSapindus saponarius (amolli) MexicoSerjania spp. (timbo) South AmericaSmilacina sessilifolia (Solomon seal) CaliforniaTephrosia piscatoria South AmericaThevetia peruviana (jorro-jorro) BrazilTrichstema lanceolatum (blue curls) CaliforniaUmbellularia californica (pepperwood) CaliforniaWikstroemia spp. Hawai'iINSECTICIDESIn addition to the more exotic arrow and ordealpoisons, the plant kingdom yields useful poisons forthe control of insects. About 1200 different specieshave been used in this context, although onlyrotenone, pyrethrum, and nicotine are of any realcommercial value. One of these, rotenone, was usedfor centuries as a fish poison in South America beforeits use as an insecticide.Rotenone is a very popular insecticide derived fromthe roots of Derris and Lonchocarpus, both membersof the bean family. The former is native to the OldWorld tropics, while the latter is New World in itsdistribution. Rotenone was first isolated from Derris in1902. It is a colorless, crystalline compound extractedfrom the dried roots. Rotenone is insoluble in water,but soluble in oil. It is about fifteen times more toxicthan nicotine. The toxic principle has no effect onwarm blooded animals. Rotenone was isolated fromthe roots of Lonchocarpus in 1926. Its roots are richerin the toxin than those of Derris.Pyrethrum is the name given to the dried flowerheads of three species of Chrysanthemum. They yieldvolatile oils that paralyze insects. This came as nosurprise to horticulturists who knew that these plantswere rarely attacked by insects. Depending upon thespecies, the pyrethrum is often called "Dalmatianinsect powder," "Caucasian insect powder," or"Persian insect powder." Pyrethrum has been usedsuccessfully in the control of flies, fleas, malarialmosquitos, and body lice.INSECTICIDES FROM PLANTSScientific Name (Common Name) CommentAnabasis ioaphylla Used in Near EastAnnona cherimola (cherimoya) Used against liceChrysanthemum cinerariifolium PyrethrumCroton texensis (croton) Used in New MexicoCymbopogon nardus (lemon grass) Citronella oilDelphinium spp. (larkspur) Seeds usedDerris spp. (tuba-root) Root source of rotenoneDolichos pseudopachyrrhizus Tropical Africa-173-Duboisia hopwoodii Leaves contain nornicotineEupatorium spp. (boneset) Eastern N.

Therefore, they are sometimes calledraticides. They are effective in small quantities, andappear to taste just fine.Squill or sea-onion (Drimia maritima) is aMediterranean member of the lily family. Since ancienttimes, its bulbs and extracts of the bulbs have beenused to kill rodents. If you or I eat this material, it willmake us sick and we will vomit, thereby ridding thesystem of the toxin. Rodents, on the other hand, haveno "vomit control center" in their brains so that anyplant parts consumed will remain in the stomach andbe absorbed. The sea-onion contains a series of toxinsthat affect the heart. They are called cardiacglycosides and they are chemically similar to thosefound in the foxglove plants. The sea-onion toxins,given by injection in moderation, have medicinal usesas diuretics, emetics, and expectorants.Sweet clover. One of the most pleasant smells ofrural areas is freshly mown pastures. Part of that nicearoma comes from sweet clovers (Melilotus spp. ),herbs of the legume family.
