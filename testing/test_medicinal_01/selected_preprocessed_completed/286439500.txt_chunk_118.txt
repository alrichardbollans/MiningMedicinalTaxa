Falcarindiol (3-20 uM) increased cholesterol efflux from THP-1-derivedmacrophages. Western blot analysis showed an increased protein level of ABCA1upon falcarindiol exposure. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that also ABCA1 mRNAlevel rise with falcarindiol (10 uM) treatment. The effect of falcarindiol on ABCA1protein as well as mRNA level were counteracted by co-treatment with BADGE, anantagonist of PPARg. Furthermore, falcarindiol significantly inhibited ABCA1 proteindegradation in the presence of cycloheximide. This post-translational regulation ofABCA1 by falcarindiol occurs most likely by inhibition of lysosomal cathepsins, resultingin decreased proteolysis and extended protein half-life of ABCA1. Taken together,falcarindiol increases ABCA1 protein level by two complementary mechanisms, i.e.,promoting ABCA1 gene expression and inhibiting ABCA1 protein degradation, whichlead to enhanced cholesterol efflux.Keywords: falcarindiol, cholesterol efflux, ABCA1, protein degradation, PPARgINTRODUCTIONCardiovascular disease (CVD) associated with atherosclerosis is a leading cause of mortality inthe world. Cholesterol metabolism has been considered as a major player in the pathogenesis ofCVD. Excessive cholesterol deposition resulting in plaques is a critical cause of atherosclerosis.Reverse cholesterol transport (RTC) is a complex multi-step process overall resulting in therelocation of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver for excretion into the bile andultimately the feces. Cholesterol efflux, the initial step of RTC, is known to enhance the exportof excessive cholesterol from peripheral tissues, in particular macrophages, and thereby toinhibit the accumulation of cholesterol in the wall of arteries (Fielding and Fielding, 1995).There is strong evidence that the cholesterol efflux capacity is inversely associated with the310Wang et al. Falcarindiol Promotes Cholesterol EffluxGraphical Abstract: The dietary constituent falcarindiol promotes macrophage cholesterol efflux by increasing ABCA1 transporter gene transcription (via PPARgactivation) and protein stability (via inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis).incidence of CVD (Rohatgi et al., 2014). Therefore, theenhancement of cholesterol efflux from macrophages mightprevent CVD, making it a potential strategy for pharmacologicalinterventions. Key determinant of cholesterol efflux is theexpression level and activity of transmembrane transporterproteins such as the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1(ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1) and the scavenger receptor classB member 1 (SR-B1) (Duffy and Rader, 2006). Among them,ABCA1 is the predominant one and it contributes to most of thecholesterol transport in macrophages (Rosenson et al., 2012; Duet al., 2015). ABCA1 mediates mostly transfer of cholesterol tolipid-poor apolipoprotein A1 (apo A1), but it can also mediatecholesterol transport using high density lipoproteins (HDL) asan acceptor (Du et al., 2015). Modulation of the ABCA1 proteinlevel is considered an important regulator for cholesterol efflux.In general, the level of ABCA1 protein is determined by denovo synthesis and protein degradation. Several nuclear receptorsare implicated in the regulation of ABCA1 gene transcription.Thus, the activation of the ligand-dependent nuclear receptorsperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) andsubsequently the liver X receptor (LXR), can lead to increasedABCA1 gene transcription (Chawla et al., 2001; Chinetti et al.,2001; Ozasa et al., 2011). The ABCA1 protein half-life is largelyregulated via the proteolytic activity of calpain-, lysosome-, andubiquitin-degradation pathways (Wang et al., 2003;Mizuno et al.,2011; Liu and Tang, 2012; Yokoyama et al., 2012). Cathepsinsrepresent key lysosomal proteases (Turk et al., 2012) and diversecathepsin isoforms (e.g., cathepsin B, D, K, L, S) are known tobe expressed in macrophages (Punturieri et al., 2000; Beers et al.,2003; Bracke et al., 2005; Vasiljeva et al., 2006).Natural products have proven to be an excellent source ofmolecules with promising pharmacological activities and novelmechanisms of action (Atanasov et al., 2015). Here, we reportthe identification and characterization of the natural productfalcarindiol (Figure 1A) as a novel enhancer of macrophagecholesterol efflux. Falcarindiol is a C(17)-polyacetylene and atypical constituent of roots and rhizomes of Apiaceae plantsused worldwide, including in Europe, such as the commonlyused vegetables and herbs carrot (Daucus carota L.) (Garrodet al., 1978), celery (Apium graveolens L.) (Zidorn et al., 2005),Notopterygium incisum K.C.Ting ex H.T.Chang (Zschocke et al.,1997), and Aegopodium podagraria L. (Kemp, 1978), amongothers. Taking the important role of PPARg in the regulationof macrophage cholesterol efflux into consideration, we havechosen this natural product as a study subject in the contextof cholesterol efflux because falcarindiol, extracted from therhizomes and roots of Notopterygium incisum K.C.Ting exH.T.Chang, was recently identified as a partial PPARg agonistin HEK-293 cells transfected with a PPARg-responsive luciferasereporter (Atanasov et al., 2013).MATERIALS AND METHODSChemical ReagentsRoswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI-1640) mediumwas obtained from Lonza (Basel, Switzerland).
