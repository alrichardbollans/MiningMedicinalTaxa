Assay was performedin triplicate.ABTS Radical Cation Scavenging ActivityThe scavenging activity of the A. laxmannii ethanol extractagainst the ABTS radical cation (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline)-6-sulphonic acid) was measured according toZengin et al. (2014). ABTSr+ was produced directly by reacting7 mM ABTS solution with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate andallowing the mixture to stand for 12-16 h in the dark at roomtemperature. Prior to beginning the assay, ABTS solution wasdiluted with methanol to an absorbance of 0.700 +- 0.02 at734 nm. Sample solution was added to ABTS solution (2 mL)and mixed. After 30 min incubation at room temperature,the sample absorbance was read at 734 nm. The ABTS radicalcation scavenging activity was expressed as milligrams ofTE per gram of extract (mg TE/g). Assay was performed intriplicate.Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)SpectroscopyIn order to compare with the results of the spectrophotometricmeasurements, the radical scavenging activity of the A. laxmanniiethanol extract was additionally measured with EPRspectrometry using the stable synthetic radical Fremy's saltas reported previously (Barakat and Rohn, 2014; Moussa-Ayoub et al., 2014). A mixture of 25 mL of the diluted extractand a 25 mL of a 1 mM Fremy's salt solution [potassiumnitrosodisulfonate, K2NO(SO3)2] in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)were filled into a 50 mL capillary. After a reaction time of30 min, the EPR spectrum of Fremy's salt radical was recordedand intensity was obtained by integration of the signal. Theantioxidant activity of the extract, expressed as milligramsof Fremy's salt equivalents per gram dry weight (mg FSE/gFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7254fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 4Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniidw), was calculated in comparison to a control reaction withthe solvent. Spectra were recorded at 21*C on a MiniscopeMS 200 X-band spectrometer (Magnettech GmbH, Berlin,Germany) with the microwave power set to 10 dB and usingmodulation amplitude of 1500 mG. Assay was performed intriplicate.Identification and Quantification ofPolyphenolic CompoundsGeneral Apparatus and Chromatographic ConditionsAn Agilent 1100 HPLC Series system was used (AgilentTechnologies, Darmstadt, Germany), coupled with an AgilentIon Trap SL mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray orAPCI ion source.Chromatographic Conditions for the Analysis ofPolyphenolic CompoundsThe experiment was carried out using an Agilent 1100 HPLCSeries system (Agilent, United States) equipped with degasser,binary gradient pump, column thermostat, autosampler andUV detector. The HPLC system was coupled with an Agilent1100 mass spectrometer (LC/MSD Ion Trap VL). For theseparation, a reverse-phase analytical column was employed(Zorbax SB-C18 100 mm x 3.0 mm i.d., 3.5 um particle); thework temperature was 48*C. The detection of the compoundswas performed on both UV and MS mode. The UV detectorwas set at 330 nm until 17.5 min, then at 370 nm. TheMS system operated using an electrospray ion source innegative mode. The chromatographic data were processedusing ChemStation and Data Analysis software from Agilent,United States.The mobile phase was a binary gradient prepared frommethanol and solution of 0.1% acetic acid (v/v). The elutionstarted with a linear gradient, beginning with 5% methanol andending at 42% methanol, for 35 min; isocratic elution followed forthe next 3 min with 42% methanol. The flow rate was 1 mL/minand the injection volume was 5 uL.The MS signal was used only for qualitative analysisbased on specific mass spectra of each compound. The MSspectra obtained from a standard solution of polyphenolswere integrated in a mass spectra library. Later, the MStraces/spectra of the compounds from analyzed samples werecompared to spectra from library, which allows positiveidentification of each substance, based on spectral match.The UV trace was used for quantification of identifiedcompounds from MS detection. Using the chromatographicconditions described above, the polyphenols eluted in less than35 min. Four polyphenols cannot be quantified in currentchromatographic conditions due overlapping (caftaric acidwith gentisic acid and caffeic acid with chlorogenic acid).However, all four compounds can be selectively identified inMS detection (qualitative analysis) based on differences betweentheir molecular mass and MS spectra. The detection limits werecalculated as minimal concentration producing a reproductivepeak with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than three. Quantitativedeterminations were performed using an external standardmethod. Calibration curves in the range of 0.5-50 ug/mL rangewith good linearity (R2 > 0.999) for a five point plot wereused to determine the concentration of polyphenols in plantsamples.Mass Spectrometry AnalysesThe detection and quantification of polyphenols was madein UV assisted by mass spectrometry. Due peak overlapping,four polyphenol-carboxylic acids (caftaric, gentisic, caffeic, andchlorogenic) were determined only based on MS spectra, whereasfor the rest of compounds the linearity of calibration curves wasvery good (R2 > 0.998), with detection limits in the range of 18to 92 ng/mL. The detection limits were calculated as minimalconcentration producing a reproductive peak with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than three. Quantitative determinationswere performed using an external standard method; retentiontimes were determined with a standard deviation ranging from0.04 to 0.19 min. Accuracy was checked by spiking sampleswith a solution containing each polyphenol in a concentrationof 10 ug/mL. In all analyzed samples, the compounds wereidentified by comparison of their retention times and therecorded electrospray mass spectra with those of standardsin the same chromatographic conditions (Vlase et al., 2013;Andriamadio et al., 2015).Identification and Quantification ofPhytosterolsChromatographic Conditions for the Analysis ofPhytosterolsCompounds were separated using a Zorbax SB-C18 reversed-phase analytical column (100 mm x 3.0 mm i.d., 5 um particle)fitted with a guard column Zorbax SB-C18, both operatedat 40*C. Sterols were separated under isocratic conditionsusing a mobile phase consisting of 10:90 (v/v) methanol andacetonitrile. The flow rate was 1 mL/min and the injection volumewas 5 uL. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on anAgilent Ion Trap 1100 VL mass spectrometer with atmosphericpressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface. The instrumentwas operated in positive ion mode. Operating conditions wereoptimized in order to achieve maximum sensitivity values: gastemperature (nitrogen) 325*C at a flow rate of 7 L/min, nebulizerpressure 60 psi and capillary voltage-4000 V.The identification of sterols was performed by comparingthe retention times and mass spectra with those of standardsin the same chromatographic conditions. To avoid or limit theinterference from background, the multiple reactions monitoringanalysis mode was used instead of single ion monitoring(e.g., MS/MS instead of MS). Linearity of calibration curveswas very good (R2 > 0.998), with detection limits in therange of 69 to 3312 ng/mL for ergosterol, 62 to 2952 ng/mLfor brassicasterol, 59 to 2808 ng/mL for campesterol, 136 to6528 ng/mL for stigmasterol, and 132 to 6336 ng/mL forb-sitosterol. The results are expressed as ug per mL of extract(ug/mL).The software ChemStation (vA09.03) and DataAnalysis (v5.3)from Agilent, United States were used for the acquisition andanalysis of chromatographic data (Vlase et al., 2013).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7255fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 5Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiIdentification and Quantification ofIridoidsTargeted A. laxmannii iridoids (aucubin, catalpol, harpagide,harpagoside, and 8-O-acetylharpagide) were analyzed by HPLC-MS on a Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system equippedwith a binary pump, autosampler, thermostat and detector (all1100 Series from Agilent Inc., United States). The system wascontrolled with Data Analysis software (version B01.03, AgilentInc., United States). The separation was carried out on anAtlantis HILIC 3.5 um (100 mm x 3.0 mm i.d.) (Waters Inc.,United States) column equipped with an online 0.2 um filter(Agilent Inc.), at a working temperature of 40*C, a flow rate of0.75 mL/min and an injection volume of 8 uL. A binary gradientsystem with eluent (A) 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) and 20 uM sodiumacetate in water, and eluent (B) 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) and 20 uMsodium acetate in acetonitrile was used for the analyzed sampleswith the following gradient: 95-80% B (0-5 min). The HPLCsystem was coupled with an Agilent Ion Trap 1100 SL massspectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionisation (ESI)source and operated in the positive mode with a scan rangebetween 360 and 680 m/z. The newly developed LC-ESI-MS/MSmethod was used to identify the targeted compounds based ontheir sodium adducts (M+23 m/z): aucubin (369 m/z), catalpol(385 m/z), harpagide (387.2 m/z), harpagoside (517.4 m/z)and 8-O-acetylharpagide (429.3 m/z), and by comparison withstandards in the same chromatographic conditions. The capillaryvoltage was set to 4 kV and the capillary temperature to 300*C.Nitrogen (N2) was used as dry gas with a dry flow of 12 L/minand a pressure of 60 psi for the nebulizer. For quantification ofthe iridoids, stock solutions of the five commercially availablestandards substances were prepared in acetonitrile, and differentconcentrations of each standard were used. All calibration curvesyielded a coefficient of determination of R2 >= 0.990. The resultsare expressed asug per mL of extract (ug/mL). All phytochemicalassays were performed in triplicate.Antibacterial ActivityMicroorganisms and Culture ConditionsFor the bioassay, five aerobic bacterial strains were used,two Gram positive: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 49444),Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19114) and three gramnegative: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Salmonellatyphimurium (ATCC 14028) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922).All of the tested microorganisms were obtained from FoodBiotechnology Laboratory, Life Sciences Institute, Universityof Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj Napoca,Romania. The bacteria were cultured on Muller-Hinton Agarand cultures were stored at 4*C and subcultured once a month.Microdilution MethodThe modified microdilution technique was used to evaluateantimicrobial activity. Bacterial species were cultured overnightat 37*C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) medium at 37*C. Thebacterial cell suspensions were adjusted with sterile saline to aconcentration of approximately 2.5 x 105 CFU/mL in a finalvolume of 100 uL per well. The inoculum was stored at +4*Cfor further use. Dilutions of the inoculum were cultured on solidMuller-Hinton (MH) for bacteria in order to verify the absenceof contamination and to check the validity of the inoculum.Determinations of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)were performed by a serial dilution technique using 96-wellmicrotitre plates. Different A. laxmannii ethanol extract dilutionswere carried out over the wells containing 100 uL of TSB andafterwards, 10 uL of inoculum was added to all the wells. Themicroplates were incubated for 24-48 h at 37*C. The MICof the samples was detected following the addition of 20 uL(0.2 mg/mL) of resazurin solution to each well, and the plateswere incubated 2 h at 37*C. A change from blue to pink indicatesreduction of resazurin, therefore, the bacterial growth. The MICwas defined as the lowest drug concentration that preventedthis color change. The minimum bactericidal concentrations(MBCs) were determined by serial subcultivation of a 2 uLinto microtitre plates containing 100 uL of broth per well andfurther incubation for 48 h at 37*C. The lowest concentration,with no visible growth, was defined as MBC, indicating 99.5%killing of the original inoculum. Gentamycin (25 uL/well atconcentration of 4 ug/mL) was used as positive control forbacterial growth. A 50% solution of ethanol in water was used asnegative control. All determinations were performed in triplicate,and values are the averages of three replicates (Mocan et al.,2014).Antifungal ActivityTo investigate the antifungal activities of A. laxmannii extracts,the following fungi were used: Aspergillus flavus (ATCC 9643),Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Candida albicans (ATCC 10231),Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 22019) and Penicillium funiculosum(ATCC 56755). These fungi were obtained from the FoodBiotechnology Laboratory, Life Sciences Institute, University ofAgricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca,Romania. Cultures were maintained on malt agar at 4*Cand subcultured every month. Spore suspension (1.0 x 105CFU/mL) was obtained by washing agar plates with sterilesolution containing [0.85% saline, 0.10% Tween 80 (v/v)], thenadded to each well to a final volume of 100 uL. Inocula werescreened for contamination by culturing on a solid medium.The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum fungicidal (MFC)concentrations assays were determined using the microdilutionmethod by preparing a serial of dilutions in 96-well microtiterplates. The extracts (EE, PEE, CE) were diluted in 0.85% saline(10 mg/mL), then added to microplates containing Broth Maltmedium with inoculum and incubated for 72 h at 28*C on arotary shaker. The lowest concentrations without visible growth(at the binocular microscope) were defined as MICs. The MFCswere determined by serial sub-cultivation of 2 uL of testedextracts dissolved in medium and inoculated for 72 h, intomicrotiter plates containing 100 uL of broth per well and furtherincubation 72 h at 28*C. The lowest concentration with novisible growth was defined as MFC indicating 99.5% killingof the original inoculum. The fungicide fluconazole was usedas positive control (1-3500 ug/mL). All the experiments wereperformed in duplicate and repeated three times (Stana et al.,2017).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7256fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 6Toiu et al.
