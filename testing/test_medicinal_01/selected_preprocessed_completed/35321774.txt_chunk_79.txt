G. Bonchev str., bl. 23, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria Pre-exploitation of the natural resources leads to their decrease.Nowadays it is a great challenge to find a way to maintain and use sus-tainably the source of medicinal plants. Ex-situ collections of Arnicamontana L. (Asteraceae) and Gypsophila trichotoma Wend. (Caryophyllaceae) were established in Bulgaria. These two species arevaluable medicinal plants, but their populations are decreasing in thenative habitats due to destruction of the areal and over-harvesting formedicinal purpose. Arnica is protected in many European countriessince the species in some countries is endangered, and in another isvulnerable [1,2,3,4]. Gypsophila trichotoma is protected by the Bul-garian Biodiversity Law and its IUCN category is assessed as endan-gered (EN) [5,6]. Studying the specific features of plant ontogeneticdevelopment is an important circumstance for its successful protec-tion and cultivation.The biological and morphological characteristics of these two plantswere followed up. The seed germination was investigated [7, 8]. Phe-nological observations and biometrical measurements were carriedout for each stage of development [9].The results show that capacity of germination of Arnica montana washighest under laboratory conditions. The seedlings were adaptedunder greenhouse conditions and then placed in the experimentalplot. The plants grew slowly in the aerial part in their first vegetationseason, but they intensely developed the rhizome being perennialplant. Most plants overwintered and came into generative period dur-ing the second year. The main flowering stage had duration aboutthree-four weeks (June-July). The records for Gypsophila trichotomashow that the seeds germinated well in some degree but then many ofthe seedlings did not survive their early stages of development; onceplanted in the experimental plot, they developed well. Few plantscame into generative period during the first year of ontogenesis. Theblossoming rhythm started in the middle summer and ended at thebeginning of autumn (August-October/November).193Macedonian Pharmaceutical Bulletin 57 (suppl), 2011MEDICINAL AND AROMATIC PLANTSposter presentationsFIFTH CONGRESS OF PHARMACY OF MACEDONIA WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATIONBoth species adapted successfully to their new habitat and conditionsand kept growing quite well during the following years preserving themain specific characteristics of their life form.REFERENCES[1] WWF Germany/TRAFFIC Europe-Germany.

OBJECTIVESThe objective of our research was to investigate if these plants (theirflavonoid components) can have any activity on human melanomacells (TVM-A12 and M14).METHODSWe received extracts of flavonoid compounds for these two plants byusing acetone and ethyl acetate for the extraction. We used the Hel-vetica pharmacopoeia and we evaluated the presence of flavonoidcompounds through spectroscopic methods.We found a 0.6% quantity of flavonoids in Sambuci Flos and 0.7%flavonoid content for Betulae Folium.These extracts were further used to determine their activity on humanmelanoma cells (TVM-A12 and M14). It was investigated the ability of these extracts to influence the cellproliferation. The cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 completed with10% foetal calf serum (FCS) at a density of 5x105/ml and distributed at100ml/well on piastre of 96 wells. The extracts were added as a seriesof dilutions (1/4; 1/8; 1/20; 1/50; 1/100) and putted in incubation at37oC for 72 hours. In the last 18 hours it was added Triziate-Thymidineas 1mCi/well.At the same experimental conditions we used these cell lines to eval-uate the influence on cellular metabolism through colorimetric meth-ods (MTS assay) using 3- (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 5- (3-carboxy -me thoxy phenyl)- 2-(4-sulfophenyl)- 2H-tetrazolium-salt as reagentwhich is added at the end of the incubation as 10ml/well. This salt isbio-reduced by the cells and its release at the culture is measured atphotometer at 490nm.The 1/10 dilution that resulted the most efficient and free of toxicitywas used to evaluate the eventual protective activity of these extractsagainst apoptotic events induced by H2O2. To realize this evaluation:cells were incubated overnight, was added H2O2 at different concen-trations for further 24 hours and than the cells marked for the evalu-ation at flow cytofluorometry. For each sample were collected andevaluated at least 5000 events, through CellQuest (BD Bioscience)software.RESULTSBoth plant extracts didn't show any toxicity and thus there is not anyevidence for antiproliferative efficacy.Both plants extracts didn't show any cytotoxic activity on these celllines.These two preliminary experiments helped us to identify the appro-priate dilutions to be further investigated on their ability to induceand/or enhance apoptosis events. After evaluation at cytofluorometry it was shown that there is a rela-tive efficacy on the enhancement of the cellular apoptosis induced byH2O2 when plant extracts are added to the cell cultures prior to H2O2. CONCLUSIONSThere is space to investigate on the eventual possibility of these plantcompounds to interfere on the cellular apoptosis. Indeed this is onlysmall evidence that should be further elaborated.REFERENCESBradley P.; A handbook of scientific information on widely used plant drugs.Bournemouth; British Herbal compendium, Vol.2; British Herbal medicineAssociation; 2006.Fecher L.A., Cummings C.D., Keefe M.J., Alani R.M. ; Toward a molecularclassification of melanoma; Journal of Clinical Oncology 25, 1606-1620; 2007.Melino G., Sinibaldi Vallebona P., D'Altri S., Annichiarico-Petruzzelli M., Rasi G.,Catani M.V., Tartaglia R.L., Vernole P., Spagnoli L.G., Finazzi-Agro A., Garaci E.;Characterization of three melanoma cell lines (TVM-A12, TVM A-197, TVM-BO)sensitivity to lysis and effect of retinoic acid; Clin.

The genus Artemisia,with up to 500 species, is one of the largest and most widelydistributed in the tribe Anthemideae. In ancient Greece and in theRoman Empire the essential oil from the Artemisia species was usedas poison antidote and to elevate gastric insufficiency. It also affect tothe blood circulation and has anti-malaric and anti-helminicproperties (1, 2). Some of these essential oils have found uses inperfumery and medicine (3, 4, 5). Artemisia species are reported topossess anti-diabetic effect and have been used in many countries ofmiddle east and Iran as a herbal medicine for treatment of diabetes,high blood pressure, anti-migraine, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-helmintic, digestive, mycolytic, stomachic, lipolytic activity (6, 7, 8, 9,10). Because of application of Artemisia in traditional medicine, manyspecies of this genus have been surveyed by phytochemists andpharmacologists (11, 12, 13). One of the important species is Artemisiaalba Turra (syn. A. camphorata) (14).The aim of our this study is to compare the content and chemicalcomposition of essential oils obtained from fresh and dried herb ofthis plant species, to determine whether there is a significantdifference in the quality of herbal raw materials.Plant material was collected in the flowering stage in September 2009from the municipality of Knjazevac. Plants were collected in the morn-ing hours, in dry place and dried 15 days in the shade of a draughtyplace. Isolation of the essential oil from fresh and dried herb of A. alba wascarried out by steam distillation in the Clevenger type apparatus, ac-cording to procedure Ph. Jug. IV (15). The oil was yellow with the odorcharacteristic of that plant. Qualitative and quantitative analysis ofessential oil was conducted by GC-FID and GC-MS methods.GC-FID analysis of the oils was carried out on a HP-5890 Series II GCapparatus, equipped with split-splitless injector and automatic liquidsampler (ALS), attached to HP-5 column (25 m x 0.32 mm, 0.52 mm filmthickness). Split ratio 1:30, injector temperature 250degC, detectortemperature 300degC, while column temperature was linearlyprogrammed from 40-260degC (4deg/min). Solutions of essential oils (1% inethanol) were consecutively injected by ALS (1 ml). Area percentreports, obtained as result of standard processing of chromatograms,were used as base for the quantification purposes. The same analyticalconditions as those mentioned for GC-FID were employed for GC-MSanalysis, along with column HP-5MS (30 m x 0.25 mm, 0.25 mm filmthickness), using HP G 1800C Series II GCD system. Transfer line washeated at 260degC. Mass spectra were acquired in EI mode (70 eV), in m/zrange 40-450. Solutions of the essential oils (1% in ethanol) wereinjected by ALS (200 ml). The constituents were identified bycomparison of their mass spectra to those from Wiley275 andNIST/NBS libraries, using different search engines. The experimentalvalues for retention indices were determined by the use of calibratedAutomated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification Systemsoftware (AMDIS), compared to those from available literature (16), andused as additional tool to approve MS findings.The contents of the essential oil of the fresh and naturally dried herbwere different. The largest quantity has been obtained from the dryherb (0.5%), while it has been around (0.2%) in the case of the freshherb. Chemical composition of essential oils is also variable.Thirty components were identified in the essential oil obtained fromfresh A. alba. Content of dominant component camphor was 24.7%,along with a-bisabolol 19.4%, 1,8-cineole 9.8%, artemisia ketone 7.9%,g-muurolene 4.5%, a-muurolol (torreyol) 3.9%, pinocarvone 3.0% andtrans-chrysanthenol 2.7%. In the essential oil obtained from the naturally dried herb twenty eightcomponents were identified. Content of camphor was 23.7%, a-bisabolol 6.1%, 1,8-cineole 14.1%, artemisia ketone15.2%,g-muurolene 0.6%, pinocarvone 1.6% and trans-chrysanthenol 8.6%. Camphor was the major constituent in both oils in approximately thesame concentration (~25%). Fresh herb oil contained significantlyhigher content of a-bisabolol (19.4%) in comparison to that originatingfrom the dried plan material (6.1%). Content of artemisia ketone indried herb oil (15.2%) was two times higher to that from fresh herb oil(7.9%). The oil from the fresh herb contained also smaller quantities of1,8-cineole (9.8%) in comparison to that obtained from the dried herb(14.1%).
