It was once thought to be made by thesun's rays or to be petrified whale sperm. Ambervaries from yellow to black. The lighter colors will getdarker upon continued exposure to light. Amberpolishes up well and is often incorporated into jewelry.When rubbed, it takes on a negative charge. One ofthe most fascinating aspects of amber is that insectsthat were flying about when the trees were exudingthe resin sometimes became trapped in the viscousmaterial, just as they do today. This means that wehave available to us now the amazingly well preservedremains of insects, millions of years old, trapped inthe amber. Large chunks of amber are quiteexpensive. The largest specimen that I know aboutweighed 18 lbs. and sold for $30 million.BALSAMS are oleoresins that contain benzoic orcinnamic acid. They are typically highly aromatic.Balsam-of-Peru, the resin found in Myroxylonbalsamum of the New World tropics, has been used toheal persistent sores, as a fixative in perfumes, as avanilla substitute, and as an ingredient in arrowpoisons, soaps, and consecrated oils.LACQUER is the resin obtained from Rhus verniciferaand other plants of the cashew family(Anacardiaceae). These shrubs are native to China,Japan, and other countries in the Old World. The resinis milky when it comes out of the plant, but it darkensupon exposure to the air. Sometimes as many as 300layers of lacquer are applied to furniture. Becausethese resins are from plants closely related chemicallyto those found in poison ivy-oak-sumac group, someindividuals will have an allergic reaction to furnituretreated with these lacquers.MIXTURES OF GUMS AND RESINS. You haveperhaps heard of three of them that were once morepopular than they are now. Frankincense is anexudate scrapped from the trunk and branches ofBoswellia carteri and B. fiereana, trees of the burserafamily (Burseraceae). The elephant tree that lives insouthern California is one of the few members of thisfamily in our part of the world. Frankincense was onceimportant as a fumigant and it was used in medicineand in embalming. It was also traded. Myrrh is asimilar material that comes from Commiphora spp.,African trees in the same family.Asafetida is a truly foul-smelling, milky juice thatexudes from the roots of Ferula assafoetida, an herbin the carrot or parsley family (Umbelliferae). Itenjoyed limited popularity as a medicine, often byhanging a bag of asafetida around the neck. I suspectthat this malodorous gunk did reduce the spread ofillness by keeping people from getting too close to-142-someone using it.GUMS AND RESINSProduct (Source) Plant Family or GroupGUMSAgar (Gelidium spp., etc.) Red algaeAlgin (Ascophyllum spp., etc.) Brown algaeArabic (Acacia senegal, etc.) BeanCarob (Ceratonia siliqua) BeanCarrageenan (Chondrus crispus) Red algaeCatechu (Acacia catechu) BeanFurcellaran (Furcellaran fastigiata) Red algaeGhatti (Anogeissus latifolia) CombretumGuar (Cyamopsis tetragonolobus) BeanKaraya (Sterculia urens) SterculiaLarch (Larix occidentalis) PineLocust bean (Ceratonia siliqua) BeanTragacanth (Astragalus gummifer) BeanRESINSOpopanax (Opopanax chironium) ParsleyPitch (Pinus australis) PineTurpentine (Pinus australis) PineOLEORESINSBalm of Gilead (Abies balsamea) PineCanada balsam (Abies balsamea) PineElemi (Several different plants) BurseraMastic (Pistacia lentiscus) CashewHARD RESINSAmber (Pinus succinifer) PineCopals (Hymenaea and related genera) BeanDammars (Hopea + related genera) DipterocarpDragon blood (Dracaena draco) Century plantLacquer (Rhus and related genera) CashewBALSAMSBalsam of Peru (Myroxylon balsamum) BeanBalsam of Tolu (Myroxylon balsamum) BeanBenzoin (Styrax benzoin) StyraxGUM RESINSAsafetida (Ferula assafoetida) ParsleyFrankincense (Boswellia carteri) BurseraGamboge (Garcinia hanburyi) MangosteenMyrrh (Commiphora spp.) BurseraSource: Hill (1952)8.6 - STARCH PLANTSStarch may be the most widely distributed organiccompound found in plants and it occurs in practicallyall parts of the plant. Although it is usually producedin the leaves as a temporary storage form forphotosynthetic products, it is primarily in seeds, roots,and a few stems where it is stored permanentlyenough and in sufficiently large quantities to make itsextraction economically feasible. Starch occurs withinthe plant body as insoluble granules that havecharacteristic sizes, shapes, and striations. Experts insuch matters can tell the source of a starch sample byexamining these granules under a compoundmicroscope.The most common sources of commercial starch aremaize, the potato, wheat, rice, sorghum, cassava,arrowroot, and the sago palm.Starch is a glucose polymer. So is cellulose. Thedifference between the two is the nature of thechemical bond that unites the glucose molecules toone another. In starch they are a-bonds; in cellulosethey are &-bonds. Now you know! In starch theindividual glucose building-blocks are linked in a lineararray (amyloses) or in a branched configuration(amylopectins). Because a-bonds are more easilyattacked by enzymes, starch can be broken downmore readily than cellulose. Alpha-amylase is theenzyme that occurs in our saliva and pancreatic juicethat breaks down starch into simpler sugars. Completehydrolysis of starch will yield glucose.Starch has many uses. We produce billions of tons ofit each year in the United States, with 95% of thestarch coming from maize. You may be surprised tolearn that about 60% of the starch used in thiscountry goes into the paper and cardboard industry,as sizings. A size is a substance used to fill in thepores of paper or cloth to make the surface appearmore uniform. In the textile industry, starch is used tostrengthen fibers and to make thread easier to weave.Laundries use starch to give a shirt a more finishedappearance. In the food industry, starch is athickening agent. On a much smaller scale, we do thesame thing in our kitchens when we thicken gravy.Starch has a number of cosmetic applications, as invarious soothing powders.We manufacture much of our industrial alcohol fromstarch. The process is essentially the same as thatused to produce ethyl alcohol, the kind found in beer,wine, and distilled beverages. The difference is thatindustrial alcohol has been denatured -- renderedundrinkable -- by adding methyl alcohol to it. Perhapsthe least known use of starch is in the manufacture ofexplosives. Cellulose + nitric acid u nitrocellulose.Starch + nitric acid u nitrostarch. Toward the end ofWorld War II, the United States was using almost 2million lbs. of nitrostarch a month to make theexplosives for hand grenades.-143-STARCH PLANTSCommon & Scientific Name Plant FamilyAir potato (Dioscorea bulbifera) YamAmerican cabbage palm (Roystonea oleracea) PalmArrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) Prayer plantBread tree (Encephalartos altensteinii) CycadCassava (Manihot esculenta) SpurgeCocoyam (Xanthosoma atrovirens) AroidCorn (Zea mays) GrassCush-cush (Dioscorea trifida) YamDasheen (Colocasia esculenta) AroidEast Indian arrowroot (Curcuma angustifolia) GingerFijian arrowroot (Tacca leontopetaloides) TaccaGiant swamp taro (Cyrtosperma chamissonis) AroidGiant taro (Alocasia macrorhiza) AroidGomuti palm (Arenga pinnata) PalmGreater Asiatic yam (Dioscorea alata) YamJapanese sago palm (Cycas revoluta) CycadKaffir bread (Encephalartos caffer) CycadMaize (Zea mays) GrassManioc (Manihot esculenta) SpurgePotato (Solanum tuberosum) NightshadeQueensland arrowroot (Canna edulis) CannaRice (Oryza sativa) GrassSago palm (Arenga pinnata) PalmSago palm (Caryota urens) PalmSago palm (Cycas circinalis) CycadSago palm (Metroxylon sagu) PalmTanier (Xanthosoma atrovirens) AroidTaro (Colocasia esculenta) AroidWheat (Triticum spp.) GrassWhite Guinea yam (Dioscorea rotundata) YamYam (Dioscorea spp.) YamYampee (Dioscorea trifida) YamYellow Guinea yam (Dioscorea cayenensis) Yam-144-8.7 ! ESSENTIAL OILSIn the section on spices and flavorings, I mentionedthat spices usually owe their desirable qualities to theessential oils that they contain. They are characterizedby their ability to evaporate readily, by their aromaticodors, and by their pleasing taste. These essential orvolatile oils are different from the fatty or fixed oils.From a chemical standpoint, essential oils arecomplex. They are often benzene or terpenederivatives or hydrocarbons of intermediate molecularlength. Some contain sulfur and nitrogen. Typicallythey are liquids. Their function in the plant is stilluncertain. Essential oils are often found in flowers, butthey may be found in other plant parts. They aretypically produced in special glands.Essential oils are widely used in perfumes,deodorants, and soaps. They also flavor manybeverages and tobacco mixtures. Industrial usesinclude insecticides, solvents for paints, and as aningredient in glue, paste, and polish. Some haveantiseptic properties and are useful in medicine.EXTRACTION METHODSDISTILLATION. When an essential oil is not solublein water (immiscible), steam distillation or boiling maybe used. A layer of oil separates from a layer of water.Hot water or live steam is injected into a still filledwith the aromatic plant part. Both vaporize and arethen condensed into an adjacent receptacle. When theoil and water are miscible, it is necessary to usetechniques that take into account the different boilingand volatilization temperatures. In this process, thereis a gradual increase in temperature, with the morevolatile essential oils distilling off first. Severaldistillations may be necessary.ENFLEURAGE (COLD FAT EXTRACTION).Distillation can ruin certain oils by the chemicalprocesses of hydrolysis, polymerization, or the loss ofa delicate oil in relatively large quantities of water.Enfluerage is the process of applying fresh flowers orother aromatic plant parts to glass plates covered withpure tallow and lard. These absorb the essential oilsfrom the plant. The saturated fat is then subjected toalcoholic extraction. This dissolves the trappedessential oil, but not the insoluble fat. The essential oilis then concentrated. Much of this process involveslaborious hand labor in which women with tweezersremove wilted petals and replace them with freshones.SOLVENT EXTRACTION. Fresh flowers and asolvent, often petroleum ether, are placed in anextractor. The ether dissolves out the essential oil,along with other impurities. The ether is then removedby a vacuum. All of this is done at room temperature.The principal drawbacks of this process are theexpensive equipment required and the precise controlneeded.EXPRESSION. This process involves the squeezing ofplant material under great pressure, either in handpresses or in giant mechanical devices. Oils and otherliquids that are expressed are separated from oneanother by centrifugation.ESSENTIAL OILSEssential Oil (Scientific Name of Source) Family Part Usedacacia (Robinia pseudoacacia) Bean Flowersambrette (Hibiscus abelomoschus) Mallow Flowersangelica root (Angelica archangelica) Carrot Roots and seedsanise (Pimpinella anisum) Carrot Seedsbalsam amyris (Amyris balsamifera) Citrus Leaves and twigsbalsam fir (Abies balsamea) Pine Leaves and twigsbasil (Ocimum basilicum) Mint Leavesbay (bay-rum) (Pimenta racemosa) Myrtle Leavesbergamot (Citrus aurantium) Citrus Fruit rindbitter almond (Prunus amygdalus) Rose Fruitsbitter orange (Citrus aurantium) Citrus Leavesbois de rose (Aniba rosqedora) Laurel Woodbroom (Cytisus scoparius) Bean Flowersbuchu (bacco) (Barosma betulina) Citrus Leavescalamus (Acorus calamus) Philodendron Rhizomecamphor (Cinnamomum camphora) Laurel Leavescarnation (Dianthus spp.) Pink Flowerscassia (Cinnamomum cassia) Laurel Barkcedar (Thuja occidentalis) Cypress Needlescedarwood (Juniperus virginiana) Cypress Woodchampaca (Michelia campaca) Magnolia Flowerschia (ghia) (Salvia hispanica) Mint Seedscitronella (Cymbopogon nardus) Grass Leavesclary (Salvia sclarea) Mint Leavescornmint (Mentha arvensis) Mint Leaveseucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) Myrtle LeavesFrench lavender (Lavandula stoechas) Mint Leaves and flowers-145-gardenia (Gardenia spp.) Gardenia Flowersgeranium (Pelargonium spp.) Geranium Leavesginger (Zingiber officinalis) Ginger Rhizomehorehound (Marrubium vulgare) Mint Leaveshuisache (Acacia farnesiana) Bean Flowershyacinth (Hyacinthus orientalis) Lily Flowershyssop (Hyssopus officinalis) Mint Leavesjasmine (Jasminum grandiflorum) Olive Flowerslabdanum (Cistus ladaniferus) Rockrose Leaves and twigslavandin (Lavandula hybrida) Mint Flowerslavender (Lavandula officinalis) Mint Flowerslemon (Citrus limon) Citrus Fruit rindlemon grass (Cymbopogon nardus) Grass Leaveslinaloe (Bursera spp.) Bursera Woodmarjoram (Origanum majorana) Mint Leavesmignonette (Reseda odorata) Mignonette Flowersnarcissus (Narcissus spp.) Lily Flowersneroli (Citrus spp.) Citrus Flowersorange (Citrus aurantium) Citrus Leaves, fruit rindorris root (Iris florentina) Iris Rhizomeotto of roses (Rosa damascena) Rose Flowerspalmarosa (Cymbopogon martinii) Grass Leavespatchouli (Pogostemon cablin) Mint Leavespennyroyal (Mentha pulegium) Mint Leavespeppermint (Mentha x piperita) Mint Leavespetitgrain (Citrus aurantium) Citrus Leavespine (Pinus palustris) Pine BarkRoman chamomile (Anthemis nobilis) Sunflower Flowersrose (Rosa centifolia) Rose Flowersrosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) Mint Flowersrosewood (Aniba perutilus) Laurel Woodsaffron (Crocus sativus) Iris Stigmas and stylessandalwood (Santalum album) Sandalwood Wood and rootsspearmint (Mentha spicata) Mint Leavesspikenard (Nardostachys grandiflora) Valerian Rhizomessweet balm (Melissa officinalis) Mint Leavesthuja (Thuja occidentalis) Cypress Leaves and twigsthyme (Thymus spp.) Mint Leavestuberose (Polianthes tuberosa) Lily Flowersvalerian (Valeriana officinalis) Valerian Rhizomesvanilla (Vanilla planifolia) Orchid Fruitsverbena (vervain) (Verbena triphylla) Vervain Leavesvetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) Grass Rootsviolet (Viola odorata) Violet Flowerswintergreen (Gaultheria procumbens) Heath Leaveswitch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) Witch hazel Stemswormseed (Chenopodium ambrosioides) Goosefoot Fruitswormwood (Artemisia absinthium) Sunflower Leavesylang-ylang (Cananga odorata) Annona Flowers8.8 ! FIXED OIL PLANTS"The diesel engine can be fed with vegetable oils andwould help considerably in the development ofagriculture of the countries which will use it. "(Rudolph Diesel, 1911)' ' ' ' 'In the last section, we looked at volatile, aromatic oils.Clearly, there are other kinds of oils produced byplants; ones that are not volatile and that are more orless odorless. These are the fixed oils. They are alsoknown as vegetable oils and fatty oils. Plants thathave high fatty oil content often are rich in proteins aswell. Chemically they are very closely related to fatsand waxes. Waxes are esters of certain alcohols.Because they are impervious to water, they serve toprotect the plant and we use them in the same way.Fats and oils are glycerides of organic acids.
