During the drying process it is important to apply appropriate temper-ature, otherwise it will adversely affect the texture and the color (Karakashova, 2003).Hussein (2012), determined the chemical composition of the dry cabbage: water content 7.25%, proteins 14.34%, fat 0.97%, fiber 21.64%, ash 5.82%, carbohydrates 71.62% and phenolic components 81.58 mg/100 g.Materials and methodsThe research in both hybrid cabbage, transam (white cabbage) and maestro (red cabbage), in fresh and dried samples showed: total dry matter content, soluble dry mat-ter, total acids, reducing sugars, ash, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin C, chlorophyll and anthocyanins.In the analysis were used the following methods: total dry matter with drying chamber at T 105 degC to a constant mass; soluble dry matter by refractometer at 20 degC; vitamin C by Tillmans method with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol; total organic acid with 0.1 M solution of NaOH; reduc-ing sugars by Luff-Schoorl method; total mineral matter (ash) in Muffle furnaces on 550 oC; calcium and phospho-rus were studied by the ICC ENISO14082:2003 method. Quantification of chlorophyll and anthocyanins was per-formed by using a spectrophotometer, for chlorophyll at a wavelength 662 and 644 nm, and for anthocyanins at a wavelength of 700 and 420 nm.The obtained results were statistically processed, using a special computer program (SPSS for Windows, Sum of squares procedure, Model III). S3 PP 155330Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 329 - 330 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsResults and discussionThe tested hybrids transam and maestro have Dutch origin, they have high dry matter content and are suitable raw material for the manufacturing industry.Determination of total dry matter content is an impor-tant parameter according to which are determined the qual-ity features of tested hybrids in fresh state, as well as in dried products. It was determined that the average content of the total dry matter content of the hybrid maestro was 7.50% in fresh and 86.85% in the dried samples, while hy-brid transam had a value of 8.45% in fresh and 88.4% in the dried samples. The average content of reducing sug-ars in hybrid transam was 4.40% in fresh and 39.75% in the dried samples and in the fresh head of cabbage of hy-brid maestro is3.6%, while in the dried samples is 33.95%.The total acids in fresh head of cabbage of the hybrid transam are 0.19% and for hybrid maestro are 0.21%, while for the dried samples they are 1.63% for hybrid maestro, to 1.76% for the hybrid transam. The tests for vitamin C in hybrid maestro in fresh head of cabbage determined aver-age content of 80.95 mg/100 g and 31.69 mg/100 g in the dried samples, the hybrid transam in fresh head of cabbage is 19.50 mg/100 g and 17.7 mg/100 g in the dried samples.The average ash content in both fresh tested hybrids was 0.53% for the maestro and 0.63% for transam, while for the dried samples were determined values of 5.70% for the mae-stro and for the hybrid transam the value of ash was 6.20%. By analyzing the average calcium Ca content in tested fresh hybrids determined were the following values: 80.95 mg/100 g in hybrid maestro and 45.15 mg/100 g in hybrid transam. Unlike in the fresh, in the dried samples the Ca is more com-mon in the hybrid transam 41.11mg/100 g than in the hybrid maestro 36.26 mg/100 g. The average content of P for both tested hybrids in fresh head of cabbage was 0.53 mg/100 g for maestro and 0.63 mg/100 g for transam. In the dried sam-ples were determined values of P 23.6 mg/100 g in hybrid transam and 21.2 mg/100 g in hybrid maestro.By analysis of variance and LSD test at the level of 0.05 and 0.01, it has been determined a statistically signif-icant difference in values for all tested parameters between both hybrids for both the fresh and the dried samples.In the hybrid transam in fresh state it has not been quantified the presence of chlorophyll. In the dried samples of the hybrid transam was found a greater concentration of chlorophyll b (0.24 mg/cm3) compared to chlorophyll a (0.20 mg/cm3). The presence of anthocyanins is found only in hybrid maestro. In the fresh head of cabbage was found more anthocyanins content, 7.14% and 1.5% polymeric dyes, compared to the dried cabbage, where the content of anthocyanins was 26.04% and 1.0% polymeric dyes. Their representation in dried cabbage compared with fresh cab-bage, point to possible degradation changes of the antho-cyanins colored matters which occur in the drying process of red cabbage.ConclusionBased on the analysis it can be concluded that the test-ed hybrids are characterized by good technological and nutritional properties. Better nutrition values are featured in dried samples of the hybrid transam than of the hybrid maestro. In the hybrid maestro, the value of vitamin C is statistically significantly higher than the hybrid transam. Dry samples of the hybrid transam contain a larger amount of chlorophyll b than chlorophyll a, and of the hybrid mae-stro contain larger amounts of anthocyanins and polymeric dyes compared with fresh red cabbage. Dried cabbage has a high nutritional and biological value, and the obtained dried product is greatly appreciated and interesting for the European and world markets.ReferencesCaunii, A., Cuciureanu, P., Zakap, A.

In fact, Anatolia is believed to be the birthplace of vineyards and winemaking. The earliest records regard-ing Anatolian wine production dates back to the Neolith-ic age (Ozdemir, 2015). Currently, Turkey ranks fourth in the world in terms of area devoted to viticulture and fifth regarding the harvested grape tonnage (Peri et al., 2015). Grapes of local varieties such as Kalecik karasi, Bogaz-kere, Okuzgozu, and Papazkarasi are the popular native Turkish cultivars of Vitis vinifera L. and they are used along with those of French origin for wine production in Turkey. The color of its fruits is black with gray bloom (Bozan et al., 2008; Peri et al., 2015). On the other hand, the interest on fruit wines, which are produced from fruits other than grapes, has also been recently increasing. A fruit wine can be considered as a biotechnological product of yeast fer-mentation of natural sugars present in the fruit juice. Gen-erally, the process forfruit wine production resembles that of grape wines. Consequently, a non-grape fruit wine is a mixture com-posed of fruit juice, alcohol, and a wide range of biomole-cules that may already be present in the fruit or be biosyn-thesized during the fermentation process (Amidzic Klaric et al., 2015; Kalkan Yildirim, 2006). Individuals are ad-vised to boost their intake of dietary antioxidants, since they play a major role in increasing the body's antioxidant potential and to provide protection against the harmful ef-fects of oxidative stress (Willcox et al., 2004). Recent ep-idemiological data have clearly indicated that regular con-sumption of wine in moderate amounts may have positive effects on health care. This health-promoting effect is gen-erally attributed to their rich phenolic content and antiox-idant effect (Naissides et al., 2006). The antioxidant po-tential of wine is closely related to its phenols content, which may be affected by a number of factors, including grape variety, fermentation processes, vinification tech-niques, ageing, and geographical and environmental fac-tors (soil type and climate). In this study, selected Anato-lian red wines and fruit wines were assayed for their poly-phenols contents. Materials and methodsStandard materials of gallic acid (1), chlorogenic acid (2), epigallocatechin (3), caffeic acid (4), vanillin (5), p-coumaric acid (6), rutin (7) and quercetin (8) were pur-chased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St. Lou-is, MO, USA). Ortho-phosphoric acid (85%) solution, eth-anol (HPLC gradient grade) and methanol (HPLC gradient grade) were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Ultrapure water for preparation of mobile phase (18.2 MO.cm at 25 degC) was obtained by using Millipore Sim-plicity UV apparatus (Millipore , Molsheim, France).The eight analytes stock solutions were prepared by dissolving weighed amount of the standard substance in ethanol at 1mg/mL concentration value. All stock solutions were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degC. Combined working solutions of mixed analytes at the concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 ug/ml were obtained by dilution of appropri-ate volume of stock solutions in volumetric flasks. Calibra-tion curves were plotted, in triplicate, by analysing these standard solutions prepared freshly. Concentration values of the quality control samples (QC) were 7.5, 30 and 80 ug/ml. Chromatographic experiments were performed by using Agilent 1260 HPLC system consisting of a quaterna-ry pump model G1311B, an auto injector model G1329B, S3 PP 156332Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 331 - 332 (2016)Clinical biochemistry / Toxicology / Food and nutritionPoster presentationsa thermostated column compartment model G1316A and a diode array detector (DAD) model G4212B. The chro-matograms was monitored and integrated by using Agile-nt ChemStation software. Chromatographic separations of analytes was achieved on an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB- C18 column (4.6 mm x 150 mm, 3.5 um particle size) and the column was thermostated at 25+-1 degC during analysis. DAD signals for every analyte were selected acoording to their spectrums obtained from Agilent ChemStation Soft-ware. Appropriate wavelenghts were selected as: 214 nm for gallic acid, chlorogenic acid and quercetin, 306 nm for vanillin, p-coumaric acid and rutin, 333 nm for chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid. Gradient elution system was used to separate all analytes. For this purpose two different mobile phase were used; Mobile phase A was 10mM phosphor-ic acid solution and mobile phase B was methanol using a flow rate of 1ml/min. The optimised gradient programme was as follows: 0-15 min (0-60% B), 15-20 min (60-80% B), 20.0-22 min (80-100% B), 22-27 min (100-0% B) and 27-32 min (0% B). Samples were injected into the system as 10 ul. Both fruit wines and grape wine of Papazkarasi type cultivar were purchased from local producers in Tur-key. After removal of alcohol by using a rotatory evapora-tor, the residual part of each wine was lyophilized. The ly-ophilized extracts were dissolved in water at proper con-centrations prior the experimentation.Results and discussionTo achieve the best separation different mobile phas-es were investigated like buffers, organic solvents and dif-ferent concentrations and different mixtures of these solu-tions. 10 mM phosphoric acid solution was used as mobile phase A and methanol was used mobile phase B for fur-ther experiments. On the other hand, other chromatograph-ic conditions like flow rate, injection volume and tempera-ture were investigated. At the end of experiments optimum parameters were determined as 1 ml/min for flow rate, 10 uL for injection volume and 25degC for temperature provid-ing the best separation of eight phenolic compounds. In the light of this information system suitability test results were investigated before validation studies. Six replicate analy-sis of this standard mixture was performed. Different con-centration values of each phenolic compounds were inves-tigated to determine dynamic range for the method devel-oped. For this purpose standard solutions of each analyte as a mixture were prepared daily by diluting from stock solution of compounds. Chromatograms obtained for each standard mixture were recorded and investigated to deter-mine calibration parameters of the method. Accuracy stud-ies for the method developed was performed by three re-petitive analyzing samples of known concentration at three different level as low, medium and high level in dynam-ic range. For this purpose standard mixtures of each com-pund at three different concentration values were prepared by diluting stock solution and concentration values were as 7.5, 30 and 80 ug/mL. Precision of the method was investi-gated bythe way of RSD values obtained from three repeti-tive analysis of known amount of standards at three differ-ent level. These RSD values for inra-day studies were low-er than 1% value that the method very precise in intra-day studies. The specifity of the method was demonstrated by using spiked wine extract samples. For this purpose each standard solution was spiked to same wine extract and ana-lyzed. It was observed that materials being in wine extract samples do not present overlapping peaks with eight phe-nolic compounds.The method developed and optimized was applied for analysis of eight different phenolic com-pound in different wine extract samples.ConclusionThe method developed was sensitive, accurate and sensitive for analysis of these phenolic constituents in dif-ferent wine samples.ReferencesAmidzic Klaric, D., Klaric, I., Mornar, A., Nigovic, B., 2015.
