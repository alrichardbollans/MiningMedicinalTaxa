PLANT KINGDOMRECORDSI began constructing this section several years agobecause these kinds of questions were often asked.What is the biggest, smallest, oldest, most expensive..., etc. Some of what follows is found in the GuinnessBook of World Records; much of it comes from a widevariety of newspaper articles and more obscuresources.Oldest plant: King's holly (Lomatia tasmanica), amember of the protea family growing in southernAustralia, is estimated to be 43,000 years old.Oldest tree: bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) inCalifornia is estimated to be 4700 years old. Somereferences cite the "Eon" tree, a redwood growing inHumboldt County, California, as 6200 years old.Tallest living tree: The "stratosphere giant," aredwood (Sequoia sempervirens) in HumboldtRedwoods State Park is 112.3 m (368.6 ft.) tall, asdetermined by Dr. Stephen C. Sillett, a botanist atHumboldt State University.Tallest tree ever measured: "Ferguson tree"(Eucalyptus regnans) in Australia was 470-480 ft. tall.Tree with the largest canopy: the Great Banyan(Ficus benghalensis), growing at the Indian BotanicalGarden in Calcutta, has 1775 prop roots and coversabout three acres.Most massive organism (plant or animal):"Pando" aspen clone in the Wasatch Mtns. of Utah. Its47,000 trunks cover 106 acres and weigh anestimated 13 million pounds.Plant with greatest coverage: The honeymushroom (Armillaria ostoyae), growing in theMalheur National Forest in Oregon, covers about 2000acres or 3.5 sq. miles. It is estimated to be 2400years old.Most massive living tree: "General Sherman," aSierra redwood (Sequoiadendron giganteum) inSequoia Natl. Park in California. At 274 ft. tall, 36.5 ft.in diameter, 82.3 ft. in circumference, and weighingan estimated 4.5 million pounds, this tree may be thelargest single organism that has ever lived on ourplanet, exceeding by far the size of any knowndinosaur or whale. It would yield 600,120 board feetof lumber.Most massive tree ever measured: The "LindseyCreek" redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), with anestimated weight of 8 million lbs. It was downed by astorm in 1905.Tree with the lightest wood: Aeschynomenehispida, a South American legume, has wood with aspecific gravity of 0.044. A cubic foot weighs only 2.75lbs.Tree with the heaviest wood: ironwood (Olealaurifolia), an African relative of the olive tree. With aspecific gravity of 1.49, one cubic foot weighs 93 lbs.Largest yield of cork bark from a single tree. Asingle tree produced enough cork for 100,000 bottlesof wine. The average yield is closer to 4000 corks.Fastest growing plant: Chaparral yucca (Yuccawhipplei). It grew 12 ft. in 14 days.Largest simple leaf: elephant ear (Alocasiamacrorrhiza), a member of the philodendron or aroidfamily growing in Malaysia. One leaf was measured at9 ft. 11 in. long by 6 ft. 3 in. wide.Largest compound leaf: raffia palm (Raphiafarinifera), from tropical Africa, has leaves with a 13ft. petiole and a 65 ft. long blade.Largest flower cluster: Puya raimondii, a memberof the pineapple or bromeliad family, that grows onlyin Peru and Bolivia.

DOMESTICATION2.1 - AN OVERVIEW' We have domesticated plants and they, in asense, have domesticated us.' In many cultures, if you cultivate plants, you arecivilized; if you do not, you are a savage.' Agriculture is a relatively recent invention; for90% of the time that we have been on earth, wehave been hunter-gatherers.'
