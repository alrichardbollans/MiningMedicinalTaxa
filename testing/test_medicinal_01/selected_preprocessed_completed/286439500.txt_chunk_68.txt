Sanguinarine [12] was also found to inhibit thedevelopment of Entamoeba histolytica, responsible for the hepaticabscess (Kozicka and Radomanski, 1963; Vychkanova et al.,1969).Liver and Biliary TractOne of the most widespread and repeatedly mentionedindications of C. majus, both in European/Mediterranean andEast Asian (TCM) tradition, was for various liver complaints.It may date back to "signatura rerum" rule from coloration ofthe latex and flowers but obviously must have been verified byobservations. Nowadays, even though this indication has beensupported by just a few in vitro and in vivo studies, caution isnecessary for alleged hepatotoxicity. Also, clinical evidence isnot sufficient to ultimately recommend this herb and galenicpreparations thereof (European Medicines Agency, 2011).Some of the hepatoprotective and choleretic/cholagogueactivity could be more aptly attributed to the presence ofhydroxycinnamic (caffeic) acids esters which have been quitefrequently overlooked in alkaloid-focused studies (Weiskirchen,2016).The question whether the supposed stimulation of bile flowis caused only by cholagogue activity or also by increasing bileproduction or excretion was first addressed by Rentz (1947).Comparison of guinea pigs and rats (that do not have gallbladder and did not respond to the treatment) reaction toC. majus tincture suggested only cholecystokinetic mechanismof action, attributed by the author to the stimulation ofsmooth musculature by berberine [28]. However, the tincturecomposition was unknown.Vahlensieck et al. (1995) indicated using isolated rat liversthat beside the earlier reports on cholecystokinetic action, alsoincrease of bile production contributes to the final outcome. Theactivity was not very high, reaching 20% increase by perfusionwith C. majus extract. The activity of alkaloid and polyphenolFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299179Zielin'ska et al. Medicinal Uses of Chelidonium majusfractions separately were only about half of that. It suggests anadditive action of the complex mixture of all active constituents.The antispasmodic activity of C. majus extract was testedin trials based on acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contraction inisolated rat ileal smooth muscle (Boegge et al., 1996). The extractwas found to be moderate antagonist (12.7%; 2.0 x 10-4 g/mlorgan bath) against (ACh)-induced contraction compared tocaffeoylmalic acid [48] (6.9%; 2.5 x 10-5 g/ml) and coptisine[31] (16.5%; 1.0 x 10-5 g/ml). Also, individual alkaloids, i.e.,chelidonine [1], stylopine [33], and coptisine [31] have beentested for relaxant activity on ileum smooth muscles (Hilleret al., 1998). Among them, chelidonine [1] and stylopine [33]showed papaverine-like musculotropic action, whereas coptisine[31] was ineffective in BaCl2 stimulation model. In carbacholand electric field induced contractions, all three alkaloids andethanolic extracts were effective.In a different contraction model--isolated and perfusedporcine uterus, the commercial alcoholic extract exhibited two-phase response, initially stimulating very strong contractionsfollowed by a longer relaxation period (Kuenzel et al., 2013).These properties were suggested as potentially useful insupporting artificial insemination or facilitating fertilizationby acceleration of sperm movement toward fallopian tubes.However, this indication was rather unknown in traditional usageand would be a novel application of C. majus.CytoprotectiveThe macerated ethanol extract from juice expressed frompulped fresh plant material (according to the homeopathicrecipes) was able to counteract carbon tetrachloride inducedhepatotoxicity (Mitra et al., 1996). The effects of extractadministration included reduced cell necrosis, absence of fibrosis,and lower lipid accumulation. Here again, no reliable data onthe composition of the tested extract was available. C. majusprimary tincture (German Homeopathic Pharmacopeia), diluted100x and 1,000x was significantly effective against cadmium-induced hepatoxicity in HepG2 and primary rat hepatocytemodels (Gebhardt, 2009). The activity was stronger thanthe proprietary compound preparation and similar to therecognized hepatoprotective herb--Silybum marianum. Theputative mechanisms of cytoprotective activity was associatedto oxidative stress relieve as demonstrated by improvementof several parameters such as lipid peroxidation, intracellularReactive Oxygen Species, reduced glutathione (GSH) level, aswell as diminished apoptosis symptoms (nuclei fragmentation,cytochrome C release, caspase 3 activation). Hepatotoxicitycaused by cadmium was also ameliorated in vivo in mice and exvivo in hepatocyte cultures. In mice, administration of 50 or 75mg/kg body weight chelidonine [1], also in form of nanocapsules,improved histopathological picture of livers damaged by Cdtreatment. Also, biochemical parameters such as ALT, AST, andALP activities were lowered to the levels intermediate betweencontrol animals and Cd treated ones. Moreover, the expression ofcell death related genes Bax and Bcl-2 was modulated to the levelscloser to the Cd untreated animals. In all tested hepatotoxicityparameters, nanoencapsulated chelidonine [1] wasmore efficient.It was corroborated with the ca. 1/3 higher distribution ofchelidonine [1] from nanoformulation into the liver tissues.The putative mechanisms relate to alleviation of oxidative stressas revealed by improvement of antioxidant status (lower lipidperoxidation, higher GSH level, and SOD and CAT activities) andvarious cell death and inflammation markers (decreased proteinlevel of TNF-a, IL-6, NFkB, p65, cas-3, iNOS) (Paul et al., 2013).Notwithstanding, the literature evidence supporting beneficialproperties in hepatobiliary disorders from both in vitro, in vivo,or ex vivo studies is still less abundant than case reports onliver toxicity. This, quite surprising disparity, should motivatepharmacologists and clinical researchers to do further and moreinsightful studies to explain the mechanisms of action andpinpoint the most active constituents or their combinations.Antiproliferative, Pro-apoptotic, and Cytotoxicity toCancer Cell LinesAs in case of liver and biliary tract disorders, the antitumorproperties have been indicated since antiquity. Today, this kindof activity belongs to the most intensely investigated. Unlikethe hepatoprotective properties, this kind of properties has beenquite well-documented in a high number of studies. Mostly,some of the major alkaloids are expected to be able to causecell death or stop proliferation of cancerous cells. This is basedon the ability of berberine [28], chelerythrine [9], sanguinarine[12], and to some extent also other alkaloids to intercalateDNA that should interfere with replication and cell division(Philchenkov et al., 2008; Basu et al., 2013; Noureini et al., 2017).However, other mechanisms have been also discovered, albeitmost studies used in vitro experiments on cell lines. Chelidonine[1] appeared to exert its cytostatic activity through interactionswith microtubules and thereby causing cell cycle arrest (Panzeret al., 2001; Havelek et al., 2016a).The selected examples of cell line-based studies on cytotoxicproperties of C. majus and its major alkaloids are summarized inTable 2.In more detail, quite many different, but mostly human celllines were used as model systems (for references see Table 2),representing leukemias (Jurkat with several modifications tostudy certain cell death mechanisms), Raji, MT-4, MOLT-4, HL-60, U-937, HEL-92.1.7, CCRF/CEM, CCRF/ADR5000), coloncarcinomas (Caco-2, HT-29, HCT116, SW480), breast cancer(MCF-7, MDA-MB231), pancreatic cancer (human PANC-1, murine PANC02), lung cancer ((A549, H460), prostatecancer (DU-145), cervical cancer (HeLa), ovarian carcinoma(A2780), liver cancer (HepG2), gastric cancer (SGC-7901),vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (A431), oesophageal squamouscarcinoma (WHCO5), and mouse melanoma (B16F10). Non-cancerous lines, such as lung fibroblasts (MRC-5, WI-38), skinfibroblasts (Hs27) immortalized cells from mice (3T3), greenmonkey (Vero), humans (293N3S, HS-27, HaCaT), or SV-40transformed bronchial epithelium (BEAS-2B) were also used.From most of the published mechanistic studies a cleardistinction can be established between mechanisms ofaction of chelidonine [1] and sanguinarine [12]/berberine[28]/chelerythrine [9].Sanguinarine [12], chelerythrine [9], and berberine [28]possess strong affinity to binding G-quadruplex in telomeresFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 299180Zielin'ska et al.
