Macedonia* bqazimi2003@yahoo.comIntroductionSideritis scardica Griseb. is wild, hardy flowering pe-rennials, known as mountain tea and is often used for pre-paring teas to cure common cold, to alleviate sinus con-gestion, aches, pains and viruses, including flu (Karapan-dzova et al., 2013). The important role of S. scardica as traditional remedies tea and its conservation status has re-quired its cultivation as market production (Kostadinova et al., 2008). Methanol and boiling water extracts (by do-mestic infusion procedure) of S. scardica showed that ex-tracts were rich in bound forms of phenolics such as hy-droxycinnamic acids, phenylethanoid glycosides and fla-vonoid glycosides, and showed very high antioxidant ca-pacity (Petreska et al., 2011a). Phenolic compounds have several roles in the plants physiological processes and have demonstrated significant health beneficial effects (Petres-ka et al., 2011b).Therefore, the aim of this work was the determination of the phenolic compounds in the methanolic extracts of spontaneous and cultivated flowering stems of S. scardica using LC/DAD/ESI-MSn.Materials and methodsPlant material: The flowering stems of S. scardica were collected in four different localities in R. Macedonia during the summer of 2013. The spontaneous samples (Ss) were collected from Ljuboten (Shara Mountain), Gurgur-nica (Suva Gora) and Lazaropole (Bistra Mountain). One cultivated sample (Sc) was collected from Dren (near to Prilep). The plant material was air dried, packed in paper bags and kept in a dark and cold place until analysis. Extraction of phenolic compounds: 0.2 g of powder plant material (homogenized samples from flower, leaf and stem) was extracted with 25 mL of 70% methanol, 30 min using US bath. The supernatant was filtered through 0.45 mm pore-size polyethersulfone filter before analysis.LC/DAD/ESI-MSn analysis: Chromatographic separa-tions were carried out on 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 um C18 Luna column (Phenomenix). The mobile phase consist-ed of two solvents: water - formic acid (1% v/v) (A) and methanol (B). A linear gradient starting with 25% B was installed to reach 30% B at 7 min, 45% B at 30 min, 50% B at 50 min and 100% B at from 55 to 60 min. The flow rate was 0.5 mL/min to 50 min and 0.8 mL/min from 50 min to 65 min, the injection volume 10 uL. The HPLC sys-tem was equipped with an Agilent 1100 series diode array and mass detector in series (Agilent Technologies, Wald-bronn, Germany). Spectral data from all peaks were accumulated in range 190-600 nm and chromatograms were recorded at 290 and 300 nm from glycosides and acylated derivatives and at 330 nm for phenylethanoid glycosides and hydroxy-cinnamic acid. The mass detector was a G2449A Ion-Trap Mass Spectrometar equipped with an electrospray ionisa-tion (ESI) system and controlled by LCMSD software (Ag-S5 PP 233490Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 489 - 490 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsilent, v.6.1.). Nitrogen was used as nebulising gas at pres-sure of 65 psi and the flow was adjusted to 12 L/min. The heated capillary and the voltage were maintained at 325 oC and 4 kV, respectively. MS data were acquired in the nega-tive ionization mode. The full scan covered the mass range at m/z 100-1200. Collision-induced fragmentation experi-ments were performed in the ion trap using helium as col-lision gas, with voltage ramping cycle from 0.3 up to 2 V. Maximum accumulation time of ion trap and the number of MS repetitions to obtain the MS average spectra were set at 300 ms and 5, respectively.The identification and peak assigmentation of all phe-nolic compounds was based on comparison of their reten-tion times and mass spectral data with those of standards and published dates. Hydroxycinnamic acids were quanti-fied using 5-caffeoylquinic acid external standard at 330 nm, phenylethanoid glycosides were quantified and ex-pressed as verbascoside equivalent at 330 nm, hypolae-tin glucosides were quantified with 4'-O-methylhypolae-tin 7-O-[6'''-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1-2)glucoside at 290 nm, whereas isoscutellarein glucosides were quantified and ex-pressed as isoscutellarein 7-O-[6'''-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1-2)glucoside equivalent at 300 nm. The stock solutions of phe-nolic standards were made up in 70% methanol to a con-centration of 1000 ug/mL. The corresponding calibration curves were constructed with five dilutions of the stock so-lutions.Results and discussionPhenolic compounds in the Sideritis extracts were identified by their UV spectra, their deprotonated molec-ular ions and their corresponding ion fragments, by using LC/DAD/ESI-MSn. Total of 30 and 19 individual compo-nents were identified in the methanolic extracts of sponta-neous (Ss) and in the cultivated (Sc) flowering stems of S. scardica, representing 45.71-100.97 mg/g DW and 49.46 mg/g DW of the total content, respectively. Phenolic com-pounds in Ss and Sc were classified into four groups: hy-droxycinnamic acids derivatives (4 and 3), phenylethanoid glycosides (8 and 5), flavonoid 7-O-diglucosides (5 and 4) and flavonoid acetylglucosides aglycones (13 and 7).The total amount of hydroxycinnamic acid deriva-tives in Ss and Sc extracts ranged from 2.80-5.31 mg/g and 2.28 mg/g, respectively. 5-Caffeoylquinic acid was found in all samples and it was dominant hydroxycinnamic acid. Phenylethanoid glycosides (PHEG) were the abundant group of polyphenols in the studied samples with the con-tent ranging from 17.92-59.39 mg/g in Ss and 11.68 mg/g in Sc. Verbascoside (7.07-24.00 mg/g), lavandulfolioside (4.77-14.92 mg/g), jonaside A (0.75-6.54 mg/g), allysono-side (1.23-6.40 mg/g), forsythoside A (1.03-4.01 mg/g) and leucoseptoside A (1.32-3.00 mg/g) were the most abundant compounds in Ss samples and represent around 90% of to-tal PHEG content. Verbascoside (6.77 mg/g) and lavan-dulfolioside (2.47 mg/g) were the major compounds in Sc sample. Total content of flavonoid glycosides (non acet-ylated and acetylated) in Ss and Sc ranged from 24.75- 42.00 mg/g and 35.49 mg/g, respectively. The prevail-ing components in Ss and Sc samples were isoscutella-rein 7-O-[6'''-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1-2)glucoside (2.00-5.47 mg/g and 12.89 mg/g), 3'-O-methylhypolaetin 7-O-[6'''-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1-2)glucoside (2.89-10.76 mg/g and 10.34 mg/g), hypolaetin 7-O-[6'''-O-acetyl]-allosyl(1-2)glucoside (2.44-3.79 mg/g and 1.13 mg/g) and apigen-in 7-(6"-p-coumaroylglucoside) (1.72-2.52 mg/g and 2.61 mg/g), respectively. 4'-O-Methylhypolaetin 7-O-[6'''-O-acetyl]-allosyl-(1-2)-[6''-O-acetyl]-glucoside (3.34-8.78 mg/g) was the major component only in Ss samples.ConclusionGenerally, the number of phenolic components found in Ss was larger than in Sc. The differences in total phe-nolic content between spontaneous and cultivated samples are directly correlated with differences in phenylethanoid content.

Cyril and Methodius", Mother Theresa 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* bozhana@orgchm.bas.bgIntroductionPepper is an excellent source of proteins, vitamins, minerals, fats and oils, phenolic compounds, aromatic sub-stances and other biologically active compounds (Campos et al., 2013). The importance of the red hot pepper varieties and their oleoresin extracts in the food and pharmaceutical industry is caused by the characteristic compounds, capsa-icinoids and carotenoids (Guzman et al., 2011). Mainly, for determination of the compounds in the sweet or hot pepper varieties, the chromatographic methods (TLC, HPLC and GC) and UV-VIS spectrometric method were used (Davis et al., 2008; Othman et al., 2011). On the other hand, 1H NMR spectroscopy has been extensively used to provide information about the composition and relative content of fatty acid units in triglycerides (Barison et al., 2010). For analysis of the capsaicinoids and carotenoids, NMR spec-troscopy is one of the most informative methods applied (Gomez-Calvario et al., 2015). The degree of unsaturation of vegetable oils can be effectively studied by IR spectros-copy based on the changes observed in the frequency data of some bands and in the ratios of absorbances of the IR spectra (Vlachos et al., 2006). Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the possibility of applying spectroscop-ic techniques (NMR and IR) in the characterization of ex-tracts obtained from red hot pepper.Materials and methodsExtracts from the pericarp, placenta, seeds, and stalk of red hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L., ssp. microcarpum longum conoides, convar. Horgoshka) obtained by extrac-tion with n-hexane using Soxhlet method and supercriti-cal carbon dioxide were analyzed using NMR and ATR-IR spectroscopy. The NMR spectra were run on a Bruk-er AVANCE II+ 600 spectrometer at ambient temperature. About 15 mg of each sample were dissolved in CDCl3. TMS was used as an internal standard. The ATR-IR spec-tra were measured in the middle IR region 600-4000 cm-1 on a Brucker Tensor 27 FT spectrometer. The samples were directly deposed on diamond crystal ATR accessory and spectra were recorded by accumulating 64 scans at resolu-tion of 2 cm-1.Results and discussionNMR Spectra. It was shown that the samples of ex-tracts from the seeds contain exclusively triglycerides (TG). The calculated percent of unsaturated fatty acids was estimated about 80%. The estimated linoleic:oleic acid ra-S5 PP 234492Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 491 - 492 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationstio was 2:1. N-polyunsaturated fatty acids (linolenic acid) were not observed. In this way the composition of TG in the seeds was shown to be similar to the corn and soybean oil. Traces of capsaicinoids were detected, while quantita-tive determination was not possible. Carotenoids were not detected. The spectra of the samples from pericarp showed similar composition as these from the seeds. Additionally, the presence of about 25% of n-polyunsaturated fatty acids was detected. In the samples from the placenta a substan-tial amount of capsaicinoids was presented. The proportion of TG:capsaicinoids was 1:2. In the region delta about 1.2-1.4 ppm intense signals appear for long CH2 chains, prob-ably waxes. In the stalk samples intensive signals were obtained due to presence of waxes. The proportion of the TG:capsaicinoids was approximately 1:0.15. ATR-IR Spectra.
