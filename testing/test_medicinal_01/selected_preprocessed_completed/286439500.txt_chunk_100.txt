Many recent investigationsconfirmed antibacterial and antifungal properties of phenoliccompounds from plant origin, among which are the mainconstituents of examined extracts (rutin and isoquercitrin) (Alveset al., 2013; Stojkovic' et al., 2013). The exerted antibacterialpotential of A. laxmannii could be associated with higher levelof mentioned phenolic compounds in ethanol extract.Antifungal ActivityThe antifungal activity of the A. laxmannii extracts (EE, PEE,and CE) was tested against a panel of five fungi, selectedon the basis of their relevance for public health. The resultsobtained for the antifungal efficacy of A. laxmannii extractsand fluconazole against tested strains are presented in Table 8.FIGURE 9 | Oxidative stress index (OSI).

Moreover, Candida albicans andPenicillium funiculosum were similarly susceptible to theinhibitory (MICs = 0.012 mg/mL) and fungicidal effects(MFCs = 0.025 mg/mL) of the chloroform extract. Nonetheless,the most resistant fungal strains were Candida parapsilosis andCandida albicans, toward petroleum ether extract with MFCs 0.5and 0.2 mg/mL, respectively. According to Kawamura and Ohara(2005), the antifungal activity of plant extracts might be ascribedto the high level of iridoids. Both methanol and ethanol extractsfrom A. laxmannii aerial parts showed high values for iridoidglycosides, especially for 8-O-acetylharpagide. These results arein accordance to previous studies performed by Makni et al. (2013), who similarly demonstrated the antifungal effect of A. ivaextracts.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7263fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 13Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiAnti-inflammatory ActivityThe anti-inflammatory effects of three A. laxmannii ethanolextract concentrations (25 mg dw/mL, 50 mg dw/mL, and100 mg dw/mL) were evaluated in vivo on a model turpentineoil-induced inflammation in rats by determining WBC count,differential WBC count, serum total nitrites and nitrates, TOS,TAR and OSI. These three extract dilutions were also evaluatedin vitro for the ability to inhibit phagocytosis. The 50 mg dw/mLdiluted extract had the best inhibitory activity on phagocytosisand oxidative stress. In conclusion, these results support thehypothesis that extracts from A. laxmannii aerial parts exert anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting phagocytosis through thereduction of oxidative stress (Table 9).Compared to the inflammation group, A. laxmannii ethanolextracts significantly reduced (p < 0.001) total WBC count(Figure 2) by lowering PMN% (Figures 3, 4). That was associatedwith an important decrease of the phagocytosis indices PA(Figure 5) and PI (Figure 6) (p < 0.001). Extracts 50 mg dw/mLand 25 mg dw/mL had the best inhibitory effects (p < 0.001) andthis was comparable to diclofenac activity (p > 0.05).Turpentine-induced inflammation significantly increased(p < 0.001) and treatment with diclofenac significantly reduced(p < 0.001) the TOS (Figure 7). Importantly, the TOSwas also reduced by the treatment with all dilutions of theA. laxmannii extract. The inhibitory effects were strongest forthe 50 mg dw/mL (p < 0.001) and 25 mg dw/mL (p < 0.01)plant extracts. Diclofenac treatment had a similar effect on TOSinhibition (p < 0.01) compared to treatment with either the25 mg dw/mL (p < 0.01) or the 50 mg dw/mL (p < 0.01)extract. The A. laxmannii extract had no important effect on TAR(Figure 8) (p > 0.05).In the inflammation group, the OSI was significantly elevated(p < 0.001), and diclofenac treatment decreased the OSI(p < 0.001) (Figure 9). The 25 mg dw/mL and 50 mg dw/mLextracts of A. laxmannii aerial parts induced a significant declinein OSI (p < 0.001). The 50 mg dw/mL extract was the bestOSI inhibitor (p < 0.001). The 50 mg dw/mL (p < 0.001)and 25 mg dw/mL (p < 0.01) A. laxmannii extract dilutionssignificantly reduced NOx (Figure 10). The OSI correlated withthe TOS (r = 0.92) and NOx (r = 0.81).Compared to diclofenac treatment, A. laxmannii extract hada lower anti-inflammatory and anti-nitro-oxidative stress effectupon all measured parameters (p < 0.001). Among the threeextracts, the 50 mg dw/mL A. laxmannii one had the best effect incomparison with diclofenac.CONCLUSIONIn the present study, the chemical composition, antioxidant,antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties of differentA. laxmannii (from Romania) extracts were evaluated for thefirst time. The major identified compounds were rutin, 8-O-acetylharpagide and b-sitosterol. The content in polyphenoliccompounds, iridoids and phytosterols could be correlatedwith the evaluated pharmacological effects. The antioxidantactivity of A. laxmannii extracts was assessed using severalmethods, and results showed good antiradical effects. The resultsof the antimicrobial evaluation showed a potent antifungalactivity against C. albicans and P. funiculosum. The anti-inflammatory effect was determined by monitoring someparameters involved in the inflammatory process, and thesefindings could indicate a possible mechanism of action. Theobtained results showed differences between the analyzedextracts; and therefore the importance of choosing the bestsolvent in order to extract the appropriate amounts ofbioactive compounds. A. laxmannii ethanol extract possessedanti-inflammatory effect by reducing total leukocytes, PMN,phagocytosis, and oxidative stress. Compared to diclofenac,only the 50 mg/mL A. laxmannii extract showed better anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects, and this couldjustify the importance of the correlation between the activityand the dose. The results confirm the use of A. laxmanniiin traditional medicine as an anti-inflammatory agent. Furtherresearch is needed in order to deeply comprehend thebioavailability and how processes are involved in the metabolicpathways.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAT, AM, LV, AP, DV, A-MG, and IO conceived and designed thestructure of the manuscript and data collection.
