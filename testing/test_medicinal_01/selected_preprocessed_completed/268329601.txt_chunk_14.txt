Sometimes the search for useful or preciousplants was the principal justification for a voyage;at other times they were incidental.' The early voyages were not well-documented.Those of Columbus marked a turning point.' Sometimes the expeditions were paid for withprivate funds; mostly they were sponsored bymonarchs or government agencies.' Especially since the 1700's, naturalists and artistswere often part of the expedition.' These voyages brought back tens of thousands ofscientific specimens, principally to the greatbotanical research centers in Europe and theUnited States.' The explorers also brought back criticalethnographic data; the first knowledge thatEuropeans had of many of the world's peoples.' Exploration continues!3.2 ! THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE"I simply do not know where to go next. I never tirefrom looking at such luxurious vegetation, which is sodifferent from ours. I believe there are many plantsand many trees that could be worth a lot in Spain foruse as dyes, spices, and medicines; but to my greatsorrow I do not recognize them.... I am the saddestman in the world for not knowing what kind of thingsthese are because I am very sure that they arevaluable. I am bringing a sample of everything I can. "(Christopher Columbus)' ' ' ' 'Christopher Columbus was not the first person inhistory to be involved in some aspect of botanicalexploration. Hatshepsut [1495-1475 B. C. E.], Queenof Egypt, is often cited as the individual behind thefirst botanical expedition. She ordered a military partyto the Land of Punt to bring back myrrh and otheraromatic resins used in religious ceremonies. TheVenetian, Marco Polo [1254-1324], explored Asia from1271 to 1295. His memoirs contain many referencesto pepper, sesame oil, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, andcassia, and to the production of these spices. He alsowrote of how people used various plants, such asflavoring wine with rice and spices.A little over 500 years ago, Christopher Columbus and80 or so companions left on a long ocean voyage, andthe world has not been the same since. Why did heundertake this great adventure? It was not to provethat the earth was a globe. That had been acceptedfact for quite some time. Columbus told his potentialsponsors that his voyage had three goals:(1) to find a water route to the Indies;(2) to bring back precious materials, including thewealth of the Indies themselves (black pepper,cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, etc. ); and(3) to bring the message of Christianity to theheathen.Somewhat more privately, he suggested that some ofthis new found wealth could be used to freeJerusalem.If we look at how well he accomplished his statedgoals, we would have to conclude that Columbus wasa failure. He did not find the Indies, although hebelieved that he had until the day he died. He was notable to bring back caravels filled with precious spices.He did not succeed in bringing the message of hisreligion to the Indians.Perhaps we are being too harsh. Was he not the firstEuropean to travel to the New World? No! Norsemenvisited coastal North America in A. D. 900-1000. Theremay well have been Polynesian voyages to the Pacificside of South America centuries before Columbus.If he was not the first, at least he did discover a newworld. While it was new to him and to his companions,it was not new to the 60-70 million people who wereliving there at the time. It had been their home for10,000-60,000 years. They had built great cities in theAmericas when London and Paris were little more thandirty little villages.Why then do we make so much of a failed mission?The voyage of Columbus was the first documentedcontact. He kept diaries that we can still consult. Sofar as we know, he was also the first to return to theNew World, a second, third, and fourth time. He wasalso the first person to lay claim to what he hadfound. He became "Admiral of the Ocean Sea" and theViceroy and Governor General of various lands.The true significance of the voyages of Columbus isthat he brought two existing worlds into contact withone another. He initiated communication andexchange -- a two-way movement of people, usefulplants and animals, harmful ones, ideas, prejudices,and diseases. This commerce has been called "TheColumbian Exchange." His voyages and those whocame after him did create a New World.The log of the Santa Maria for 13 October 1492 givesus the first European reference to tobacco. "In themiddle of the gulf ... I found a man in a canoecarrying a little piece of bread ... a gourd of water ...and some dry leaves which must be a thing very muchappreciated among them." Other major New World discoveries included maize(corn), the potato, many new kinds of beans, thepeanut, vanilla orchid, chocolate, pineapple, horse,-46-and turkey. The Food and Agriculture Organization ofthe United Nations cites four principal plants that feedour species: wheat, rice, maize, and the potato --three cereals and a root crop. Two are of New Worldorigin.A more complete listing of the two-way traffic thatconstitutes the Columbian Exchange follows:FROM THE NEW WORLD TO THE OLDCereals:Maize, wild-riceRoot Crops:Potato, sweet potato, Jerusalem artichoke, cassavaVegetables:Beans (lima, scarlet), squash, pumpkinsSpices/Flavorings:Peppers, vanilla, pimento, allspice, coriander(cilantro), chocolateFruits/Nuts:Pecan, black walnut, blueberry, cranberry,strawberry, persimmon, cashew, pineapple, guava,papaya, avocado, sunflowerBeverages:Cacao (chocolate)Medicinal/Psychoactive:Quinine, coca, tobaccoMiscellaneous:Rubber, sugar maple, turkey, slaves, syphilis (? )FROM THE OLD WORLD TO THE NEWCereals:Wheat, barley, rice, oats, millets (a group of small-grained cereals)Vegetables:Cabbage, lettuce, onions, watermelon, soybean,peas, lentilsSpices/Flavorings:Black pepper, cloves, cinnamon, apple, pear, citrusfruits, olive, bananaBeverages:Coffee, teaMedicinal/Psychoactive:Foxglove, opium, marijuanaMiscellaneous:Sugar cane, sugar beet, horse, cow, pig, chicken,honeybee, slaves, missionaries, smallpox,diphtheria, measles3.3 ! THE POLYNESIANEXCHANGEWhile much has been made, and justifiably so, of thevoyages of Columbus and their consequences, lessattention is often paid to the cultural and biologicalimportance of the earlier oceanic explorations madeby Asians who traveled to the far outposts of what wenow call Polynesia. The spread of these Proto-Polynesians and their plants and animals acrossthousands of miles and taking thousands of years tocomplete is one of the great events in human history.THE POLYNESIAN EXPANSIONB.

Consider theplants that we call to mind when someone says"Hawai'i." My guess is that every one on your list wasbrought there hundreds or thousands of years agoduring the waves of colonization. They are oftencollectively known has the heritage plants. Or to putit another way, none of the plants that most of usassociate with Hawai'i is native to the island chain.HAWAI'IAN HERITAGE PLANTSHawai'ian English Name Scientific NameRoot Crops:Ape Elephant ear Alocasia macrorrhizaHoi Air-potato Dioscorea bulbiferaPia Arrowroot Tacca leontopetaloidesPi'a Five-leaved yam Dioscorea pentaphyllaTaro Taro Colocasia esculentaU a l a Sweet potato Ipomoea batatasUhi Common yam Dioscorea alataSpices & Flavorings:Ko Sugar cane Saccharum officinarumAwapuhi Shampoo ginger Zingiber zerumbetFruits:Mai'a Banana Musa x paradisiacaNiu Coconut Cocos nuciferaOhi'a al Mountain-apple Syzgium malaccenseUlu Breadfruit Artocarpus altilisCosmetics:Tiare Tahitian gardenia Gardenia taitensisIndustrial:Hala Screwpine Pandanus tectoriusHau Hawaiian tree hibiscus Hibiscus tiliaceusIpu Bottle gourd Lagenaria sicerariaKou Cordia Cordia subcordata-47-Kukui Candle nut Aleurites moluccanaMilo Pacific rosewood Thespesia populneaOhe Bamboo Schizostachyum glaucifoliumTi, ki Cordyline fruticosaWauke Paper mulberry Broussenetia papyriferaMedicinal, Psychoactive, & Toxic:Auhuhu Tephrosia purpureaAwa Kava Piper methysticumKamani Calophyllum inophyllumNoni Indian-mulberry Morinda citrifolia3.4 ! MORE RECENTEXPLORATION"The discovery of America, and that of a passage tothe East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, are thetwo greatest and most important events recorded inthe history of mankind." (Adam Smith, 1776)"Wherever the European had trod, death seems topursue the aboriginal. We may look to the wideextent of the Americas, Polynesia, the Cape of GoodHope, and Australia, and we find the same result." (Charles Darwin, 1839)' ' ' ' 'The brief sketches that follow tell of two kinds ofexplorers. In many cases, the leader of theexpedition had no particular training or interest inbotany or natural history. However, the exploringparty often included specialists in various areas.Charles Darwin served on the H. M. S. Beagle.Joseph Banks was the naturalist on Captain Cook'sfirst voyage to the South Pacific. Other greatexpeditions were led by scientists, such as Alexandervon Humboldt, for the specific purpose of collectingbotanical specimens and making detailedobservations. The diaries and field notes of thefamous explorers often contained information aboutuseful plants, how they were prepared, theiraboriginal names, and other ethnographic data.Vasco da Gama [1469?-1524], Portuguesenavigator. His party of about 170 men on four shipsexplored the coasts of Africa and India. They wereespecially interested in locating cloves, pepper, andginger.Francisco Pizarro [1470-1541], Spanishconqueror of Peru. The dates of his major activitiesare 1524-1525, 1526-1527, and 1531-1533.Ferdinand Magellan [1480-1521], Portuguesenavigator and explorer. Of particular interest is hisvoyage to the Spice Islands from 1519-1522.Hernan Cortes [1485-1547], Spanish conquerorof Mexico (1519-1521).Francisco de Orellano [1490-1546], Spanishexplorer of the Amazon (1541-1542) and usuallycited as the first man to go down the Amazon River.Gaspar de Carvajal kept detailed diaries. He wrote ofa race of tall, white, naked warrior women who usedthe bow and arrow much better than did the maleIndians. He called them Amazons. A second voyageoccurred in 1545-1546.Jacques Cartier [1491-1557], French explorer.His three voyages (1534-1542) provided an earlyinventory of the natural products of the New World.Francisco Hernandez [1515-1578], Spanishphysician and natural historian. His work wascompiled into 16 folio-sized volumes that were sentto King Philip II. He deposited them in the library atthe Escorial. A terrible fire would later destroy mostof Hernandez's work.Jan Pieterszoon Coen [1587-1629], Dutchexplorer. He sailed to the Spice Islands, where heattempted to control the sales of cloves, nutmeg,and pepper.Abel Tasman [1602-1659], Dutch navigator andexplorer (1642-1643; 1644) of the South Pacific. Hediscovered New Zealand and Van Damien's Land,now known to us as Tasmania.Louis-Antoine de Bougainville [1729-1811],French navigator and explorer who wascommissioned by the French to circumnavigate theglobe (1766-1769) on the La Boudeuse and theL'Etoile (storeship).
