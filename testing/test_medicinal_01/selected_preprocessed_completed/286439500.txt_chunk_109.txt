The hydrolysates werediluted with methanol-water (7:3, v/v) to 50 mL, filtered througha PTFE syringe filter (as above) and injected (5 uL) intoFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 680284Marchelak et al. Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower Extractsthe HPLC system. The HPLC-PDA assays were carried outaccording to Olszewska (2012) with quercetin, kaempferol andisorhamnetin used for external calibration. Results were re-calculated for total contents of glycosides with the molecularmasses of avicularin, juglanin, and isorhamnetin diglucoside,correspondingly. The total contents of phenolic acids (TAC) wereassayed by HPLC-PDA according to Olszewska et al. (2012) withcaffeic acid and chlorogenic acid used as calibration standards forquantification of simple hydroxycinnamic acids and quinic acidpseudodepsides, respectively.Antioxidant Activity in Chemical ModelsThe DPPH free-radical scavenging activity was determinedaccording to the method optimized previously (Olszewskaet al., 2012) and expressed as normalized EC50 valuescalculated from concentration-inhibition curves. The FRAP(Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) was determined accordingto Olszewska et al. (2012) and expressed in umol of ferrousions (Fe2+) produced by 1 g of the dry extract or standard,which was calculated from the calibration curve of ferroussulfate. The ability of the extracts to inhibit AAPH-inducedperoxidation of linoleic acid (LA) was assayed as describedpreviously (Olszewska et al., 2012) with peroxidation monitoredby quantification of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances(TBARS) according to the method of Kljak and Grbesa (2015)with some changes. Briefly, before and after the sampleswere incubated for 3 h at 50.0 +- 0.1*C in the dark, thereaction solution (0.5 mL) was mixed with 0.67% (w/w)aqueous thiobarbituric acid (1 mL), 0.05M HCl (0.5 mL),Tween R(c)40 (1 mL), and then heated for 30 min in thewater bath at 95*C. The absorbance was measured at 535nm vs. the control with methanol-water (7:3, v/v) insteadof the reaction mixture. The inhibition ratio (I%) of theLA-peroxidation was calculated as follows: I% = (1Acontrol- 1Asample)/1Acontrol, where 1A is the difference betweenthe absorbance measured before and after incubation. Finally,antioxidant activity was expressed as IC50 values calculated fromconcentration-inhibition curves.Antioxidant Activity in Human PlasmaModelsIsolation of Blood Plasma and Preparation ofSamplesBlood from five healthy, non-smoking volunteers wasobtained from the Regional Centre of Blood Donationand Blood Treatment in Lodz (Poland), collected on CPD(citrate/phosphate/dextrose) solution in the Fresenius-KabiCompoflex bags, and next plasma was isolated by differentialcentrifugation of blood (Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et al., 2013). Allexperiments were approved by the committee on the Ethics ofResearch at the University of Lodz 8/KBBN-UL/II/2015. Forthe FRAP assay and measurements of 3-nitrotyrosine, plasmasamples were diluted with a (Ca2+)-free PBS buffer (1:4, v/v),whereas for hydroperoxide and TBARS assays plasma wasdiluted with (Ca2+)-free PBS in a volume ratio 1:1. For all tests,samples were pre-incubated for 5 min at 37*C with the examinedextracts added to the final concentration range of 1-50ug/mL,and then exposed to 100 uM peroxynitrite (ONOO-). Controlsamples were prepared with plasma untreated with the extractsand/or peroxynitrite. In the experiments with blood plasma andthe extracts only (without adding ONOO-) no pro-oxidativeeffect was found. Protein concentration in blood plasma wasestimated using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (according toprotocol provided by the manufacturer).Determination of 3-Nitrotyrosine in Human PlasmaProteinsDetection of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins by thecompetitive ELISA (C-ELISA) method in plasma samples(control or antioxidants and ONOO--treated plasma) wasperformed according to Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et al. (2013). Theconcentrations of nitrated proteins were estimated from thestandard curve and are expressed as the 3NT-Fg equivalents (innmol/mg of plasma protein).Ferric-Xylenol Orange Hydroperoxide AssayConcentration of hydroperoxides in plasma samples (controlor antioxidants and ONOO--treated plasma) was determinedby a ferric-xylenol orange (FOX-1) protocol (Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et al., 2013). The FOX-1 reagent contained 125 uMxylenol orange and 100mM sorbitol in 25mM sulfuric acid, andwas freshly prepared each time before use by the addition ofammonium ferrous sulfate to the final concentration of 250 uM.To perform FOX-1 assay, blood plasma samples were mixed withthe reagent in a volume ratio 1:9 and incubated for 30 min inthe dark (25*C). Absorbance of the sample was measured at560 nm against blank (water instead of plasma). The amount oflipid hydroperoxides was calculated from the standard curve ofhydrogen peroxide and expressed in nmol/mg of plasma proteins.TBARS TestDetermination of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances(TBARS) in plasma samples (control or antioxidants andONOO--treated plasma) was performed according toKolodziejczyk et al. (2011). Results were expressed in umolTBARS/mL of plasma.Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) AssayThe influence of the extracts on the total antioxidant activityof plasma (dependent on non-enzymatic antioxidants) wasdetermined according to Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et al. (2014) withsome modifications. The freshly collected plasma samples werediluted with a (Ca2+)-free PBS buffer in a volume ratio of 1:4,prepared as described above, and then added to the reagentmixture in a volume ratio of 1:10:1:1 for plasma, acetate buffer(300mM, pH 3.6), TPTZ (10mM, in 0.04M hydrochloric acid),and ferric chloride (20mM), respectively. After incubation for 15min at 37*C, the measured FRAPs of plasma samples (controlor antioxidants and ONOO--treated plasma) were expressed inmM Fe2+ in plasma.Inhibition of Pro-Inflammatory EnzymesThe ability of the extracts to inhibit lipoxygenase (LOX) andhyaluronidase (HYAL) was examined as described by Michelet al. (2017) with some changes. Briefly, in the LOX tests thereagents were used in a volume ratio of 1:2:1 for workingsolutions of the tested analyte, linoleic acid, and enzyme. ResultsFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 680285Marchelak et al. Bioactivity Potential of Prunus spinosa L. Flower Extractsof the both assays were expressed as IC50 values calculated fromconcentration-inhibition curves.Cell Viability AssayPBMCs were isolated from human blood (obtained and collectedas described above) using the Histopaque R(c)-1077 medium (asterile solution of polysucrose, 57 g/L, and sodium diatrizoate,90 g/L, with a density of 1.077 g/mL). From each of eightdonors, two independent PBMCs isolations and incubationswith the extracts were performed. Blood was carefully layered(in a volume ratio of 1:1) onto the medium, and centrifugedfor 30 min (400 x g, at room temperature). Then, the pelletwas washed two times with 0.02M PBS buffer. The obtainedfraction of PBMCs was suspended in PBS. Cell suspensions (1x 106 PBMCs/mL) were incubated with plant extracts, addedto the final concentration of 5ug/mL. Cell viability (%) wasdetermined during a spectrofluorimetric analysis, involving theuse of propidium iodide as a fluorescent dye. Measurements wereconducted using a microchip-type automatic cell counter Adam-MC DigitalBio (NanoEnTek Inc., Seoul, Korea), after 60 and120 min of incubation of PBMCs with the examined substances(at 37*C). The procedure was carried out according to themanufacturer's protocol.Statistical AnalysisNormality of the distribution of the results was verified using theShapiro-Wilk test, and the homogeneity of variances using theLevene's test. The results are reported as means +- SD (standarddeviation) or +- SE (standard error) for the indicated number ofexperiments. The significance of differences between samples andcontrols was determined with one-way ANOVA (for chemicaltests) or one-way ANOVA for repeated measures (for humanplasma model), followed by the post-hoc Tukey's test for multiplecomparisons. The correlations were evaluated using F-test. Allcalculations were performed using the Satistica12Pl software forWindows (StatSoft Inc., Krakow, Poland) with p-values less than0.05 regarded as significant.RESULTSLC-MS Metabolite ProfilingPhytochemical profiling of the dry extracts revealed significantdifferences in their chemical composition depending on theextraction solvent (Figure 1, Tables 1, 2). The qualitativeUHPLC-PDA-ESI-MS3 analysis resulted in full or partialidentification of over fifty phenolic constituents (Figure 1,Table 1, peaks 1-59) belonging to three main classes ofphytochemicals--flavonols (thirty eight analytes), flavan-3-olderivatives (catechins and proanthocyanidins, seven peaks)and phenolic acids (twelve compounds). The analytes werestructurally characterized based on the comparison of theirchromatographic behavior and ESI-MS3 fragmentation patterns(in positive and negative ionization modes) with the literaturedata or reference standards, both commercial and isolatedFIGURE 1 | Representative UHPLC chromatograms of the P. spinosa flower dry extracts at 280 nm: (A) MED, defatted methanol-water (7:3, v/v) extract; (B) DEF,diethyl ether fraction.
