Blank PEGylated liposomes had a mean size of 141 nm (SPAN 3.845) The steric stabilization afforded by PEG incorporation into the lipid bilayer of RA-HE loaded liposomes affected the mean size of the vesicles. Namely, sample P2a had D50 of 163 nm (SPAN 2.06), which is known to be suitable for intravenous application achieving long plasma circulation time (Tanaka et al., 2004), and no significant difference in EE was observed. Further studies related to the influence of PEG quantity on the physicochemical and biopharmaceutical properties of liposomes should reveal the potential of designed system for efficient brain delivery of RA-E. ConclusionIn this study, RA-E loaded conventional and PEGylat-ed liposomes were successfully prepared. Considering the characteristics of the liposomes such as particle size, dis-tribution and encapsulation efficiency, the delivery system seems suitable to overcome the drawbacks and to improve brain drug therapy after parenteral application.ReferencesCvetkovikj, I., Stefkov, Gj., Acevska, J., Petreska-Stanoeva, J., Karapandzova, M., Stefova, M., Dimitrovska, A., Kulevanova, S., 2013.

Spreng from Korab mountainViktorija Labroska *, Ivana Cvetkovikj, Gjoshe Stefkov Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, "Ss. Cyril and Methodius" University, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, R. Macedonia* viktorija.labroska312@gmail.comIntroductionArctostaphylos uva-ursi (L.) Spreng. fam. Ericace-ae, also known as bearberry or bear's ear, is a small pro-cumbent woody groundcover shrub, widely distributed on a global level. The flowers are small, urn-shaped and grouped in terminal clusters that bloom in summer and the fruits are a red berries. The leaves are small, shiny and ev-ergreen, remaining green for 1-3 years before falling. The use of bearberry leaves for the first time was lit-erally documented in the middle Ages in the Welsh "Phy-sicians of Nyddfai" from the 13th century. From the begin-ning of 19th century, bearberry is in official use. It was used for treatment of different diseases such as hydrops, lithia-sis, in diabetes, for the therapy of gonorrhoea, etc. Now-adays only the use as urinary tract antiseptic and diuret-ic remains due to the presence of arbutin and hydroqui-none (Beaux et al., 1999; Jurica et al., 2015). Additional-ly, the herb contains tannins that have astringent effect and protect from early stage of infections (Dykes et al., 2003; Head, 2008; Pegg et al., 2008). According to Ph.Eur.8.0 (2014), commercial forms that are used consist of whole or cut, dried leaf of Arcto-staphylos uva-ursi that contains not less than 7.00% of an-hydrous arbutin (Ph.Eur.8.0., 2014). The content of arbu-tin can be determined in plant extracts by many methods including: sprectrophotometry, capillary zone electropho-resis, and HPCL method, that was found to be the most suitable for arbutin separation and is prescribed within the Ph.Eur.8.0. (Amarowizh et al., 2009; Parejo et al., 2001; Ph.Eur.8.0, 2014). In the Republic of Macedonia the natural populations of bearberry represent a unique source of leaves which are distributed in the following areas: Skopje Valley, moun-tains of Yakupitsa, Karadzitsa, Dautitsa, Shar Mountain, Osogovo Mountains and Mariovo. Bear's ear thrives on rocky ground in the light woods of black and white pine and in subalpic plant communities on limestone and dolo-mite ground. Although it is an indigenous species for this region there are no literature data for the content of the ar-butin in bearberry populations.Therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantify the amount of arbutin from seven different populations of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi from Korab Mountain with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).Materials and methodsPlant MaterialLeaves were collected from seven different natural populations of A. uva-ursi from seven different mountain areas of Korab, from R. Macedonia. Every area shows dif-ferent geographical characteristics. Plant identity was veri-fied and voucher specimens were deposited at the Institute of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Skopje, Macedo-nia. Leaves were air dried, packed in paper bags, and kept in the dark and cold until analysis.Extraction: The water extracts were isolated from dried leaves from bearberry, according to the method de-scribed in the European Pharmacopeia (Ph.Eur.8.0., 2014).HPLC methodChromatographic analyses were carried out using an HPLC system from the Agilent 1200 series, apply-S8 OP 307644Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 643 - 644 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessioning the method described in the Ph.Eur.8.0 monograph (01/2008:1054), using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB RP C-18 col-umn (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mm, Agilent, Germany), pro-tected with a guard column (4 mm x 4.6 mm, RP-18, 5 mm, Agilent, Germany). The eluents were: methanol R and wa-ter R, 10:90 (v/v). The flow rate was 1.2 mL/min and the injection volume was 20 mL. The column temperature was maintained at room temperature, and detection was carried out at 280 nm. Quantification of the samples for arbutin was per-formed immediately after extraction to avoid possible chemical alterations using a 1 mg/mL stock of arbutin stan-dard.Results and discussionThe content of arbutin expressed as % of anhydrous arbutin, was determinate by high performance liquid chro-matography from seven different populations of A. uva ursi from Macedonia and ranged from 7.41% to 10.46%. Among the analysed samples the highest content of arbutin was found in population 06 (P06) = 10.46% and the lowest was in the population 11 (P11) = 7.84%.All seven sampled indigenous populations of bearber-ry leaf had arbutin content above 7.00%, which comply with the Ph.Eur.8.0 requirements. ConclusionSeven population of Arctostaphylos uva-ursi from Ko-rab Mountain were evaluated regarding arbutin content ac-cording to the Ph.Eur.8.0 method. The content was deter-mined by high performance liquid chromatography and the results were ranged from 7.84% to 10.46%. All pop-ulations complied with the requirements of the Ph.Eur.8.0 (not less than 7%).ReferencesAmarowicz, R., Pegg, R.B., Kosinska, A., 2009.

Cyril and Methodius, Majka Tereza 47, 1000 Skopje, Republic of Macedonia* ana.vavlukis@gmail.comIntroductionAntiplatelet therapy is standard treatment in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and/or undergo-ing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Clopido-grel, an adenosine diphosphate receptor (P2Y12) block-er, has been used as a gold standard (alone orinassocia-tion with aspirin) to prevent vascular complications in ath-erothrombotic patients undergoing PCI, and as a long-term prevention of cardiovascular events (Campo et al., 2011). Clopidogrel is subject to efflux via P-glycoprotein (encod-ed by the ABCB1 gen, also known as MDR1). The clini-cal outcome of Clopidogrel may be influenced by both ge-netic and non-genetic factors. Among genetic factors, the ABCB1 polymorphisms, particularly C3435T, may be as-sociated with altered drug metabolism, efficacy and clini-cal outcome (Mega et al., 2010). The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of ABCB1 C3435T genetic poly-morphism on clinical cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease patients on Clopidogrel treatment.Materials and methodsThe study included a total of 227 subjects, of which 107 healthy volunteers (76 men and 31 women) and 120 patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease on treat-ment with Clopidogrel from the Special Hospital for Sur-gical Diseases "Filip II". The genotyping of both the con-trol group and the patient group was performed with Real-Time PCR based on the allelic discrimination method using TaqMan SNP genotyping assay for C3435T (rs1045642 as-say ID C_7586657_20) according to the guidelines of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, USA). Statistical analy-sis was performed using SPSS software (v. 22). The gen-otype distributions were assessed for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) with kh2 test using an online calculator (http://ihg.gsf.de/cgi-bin/hw/hwa1.pl).Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence interval limits (95% CI). The level of statistical significance was defined as p <= 0.05.Results and discussionThe distributions of the ABCB1 allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of C1236T, G2677T/Aand C3435T genetic variations in ABCB1 gene for the Macedonian healthy population (control group) have been determined. According to our results, the frequency of the wild-type al-lele for C3435T (51%) in our study is similar to the gener-al frequency reported for Caucasians of European descen-dant, but differs from that of Asian and African population. Allelic frequencies in exon 26 were 51.4% for C allele and 48.6% for mutant T allele, whereas the observed genotype frequencies were 25.2% for 3435CC, 52.3% for 3435CT and 22.5% for 3435TT (Naumovska et al., 2014). The de-termination of distribution of the ABCB1 allele, genotype and haplotype frequency of the C3435T genetic variation in ABCB1 gene in the patient group is in progress.In recent years, there are vast numbers of published data that report on evidence for the influence of SNPs in the ABCB1 gene on P-gp function. These polymorphic S8 OP 308646Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 645 - 646 (2016)Oral presentationsStudent sessionvariants are potential determinants of inter-individual vari-ability in drug response and potential for a negative clinical outcome. A meta-analysis of twelve studies (four involved platelet activity and ten involved clinical outcomes) indi-cated that the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism might be a risk factor for early major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients on clopidogrel, and that TT homozy-gotes decreased the outcome of bleeding compared with CC homozygotes. The four platelet activity studies result-ed in an association between high platelet activity and the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism that was not statistically significant. The long-term MACE had no significant asso-ciation with ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism. Three studies demonstrated that significant elevated risk of early MACE was associated with T allele, TT homozygote and CT + TT dominant genetic model. The ABCB1 C3435T polymor-phism was unrelated to the rate of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Seven cohort stud-ies reported that stent thrombosis was not associated with ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism in all genotype models. The comparison of TT vs. CC was associated with a sig-nificant reduction in the outcome of bleeding in five cohort studies (Su et al., 2012). Another meta-analysis of six stud-ies with 10.153 subjects failed to show an association be-tween the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism and the risk of long-term adverse clinical events in clopidogrel treated pa-tients. The association of the C3435T polymorphism with risk of overall recurrent ischemic events and stent throm-bosis in clopidogrel treated patients was not statistically significant for all genetic models. However, a significant association was identified between the TT homozygotes and risk of short-term recurrent ischemic events (Luo et al., 2012).Another study found no association of ABCB1 C3435T genotype with clopidogrel response or risk of stent thrombosis in patients undergoing coronary stenting.
