For that purpose, HP-5ms cap-illary column (30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25 mm) was used. Operating conditions were as follows: oven tem-perature at 60 degC (2 min), 10 degC/min to 200 degC (2 min) and 5 degC/min to 240 degC (7 min); helium as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min; injector temperature 250 degC and that of the FID detector 250 degC. One ml of each sample was inject-ed at split ratio 1:1. The mass spectrometry conditions were: ionization voltage 70 eV, ion source temperature 230 degC, transfer line temperature 280 degC and mass range from 50 - 500 Da. The S5 OP 219462Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 461 - 462 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationsMS was operated in scan mode.Identification of FAME was made by comparison of their retention times and mass spectral data with those ob-tained from standards and from Nist, Wiley and Adams mass spectra libraries. The percentage ratio of FAME was computed by the normalization method of the GC/FID peak areas without any correction factors.Results and discussionThe content of total oil isolated from pine nuts of Macedonian species yielded from 32.61% to 38.56% in nuts of Pinus nigra and Pinus peuce, respectively.Data analysis of the chemical composition of exam-ined oil samples revealed three different classes of fatty ac-ids: saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The last one was dominant fraction in both species (65.25% in nuts of Pinus peuce and 58.65% in nuts of Pinus nigra), while the fraction of saturated and monounsaturat-ed fatty acids were present in smaller amount (7.15% and 26.10% in Pinus peuce and 14.70% and 25.56% in Pinus nigra, respectively). Total of 21 fatty acids were identified in the investigat-ed oil samples isolated from Pinus peuce nuts which rep-resented 97.79% of total oil. The most abundant fatty acids were linoleic acid (61.95%) which is classified as polyun-saturated o-6 fatty acid and oleic acid (24.98%) known as monounsaturated o-9 fatty acid. Palmitic acid (3.51%) was dominant in the class of saturated fatty acids. Similarly 28 fatty acids were identified in the oil samples isolated from nuts of Pinus nigra which represented 98.60% of total oil. Predominant fatty acids were the same linoleic (54.81%), oleic (22.80%) and palmitic acid (9.07%).In terms of data concerning the chemical composi-tion of oil isolated from pine nuts, only one study could be found regarding chemical composition of fatty oil isolated from black pine or Pinus nigra but still there is no avail-able published data about the composition of oil obtained from nuts of Pinus peuce or Macedonian pine. According Bagci and Karaagacli (2004), the oil isolated from nuts of black pine from Turkey contains linoleic (47.10%), oleic (17.80%) and palmitic acid (4.70%) as major constituents what correlates to our findings.ConclusionSummarizing the obtained results, it is evident that pine nuts collected from Macedonian species are rich in oil that contain significant amount of unsaturated o-6 as well as o-9 fatty acids thus could be considered as their potential source. Moreover further investigations of chem-ical composition should be made in order to provide more data for their possible medicinal, pharmaceutical or com-mercial utilization.ReferencesAlbert, C.M., Gaziano, J.M., Willett, W.C., Manson, J.E., 2002.

They are organic bases with aliphatic (putres-cine (Put), cadaverine (Cad), spermine (Spm), spermidine (Spd)), aromatic (tyramine (Tyr), phenylethylamine (Phe)) or heterocyclic (histamine (His), tryptamine (Trp)) struc-tures, can be classified as monoamines (Phe and Tyr), di-amines (His, Cad, Put) or such as volatile (Phe) and non-volatile (His, Cad, Put, Tyr, Spm, agmatine (Agm), Trp) biogenic amines. The main factors for formation of bio-genic amines in foods or fermented foods are following: the availability of free amino acids, the existence of de-carboxylase positive microorganisms and the presence of suitable pre-conditions that allow bacterial growth. Pres-ent in higher concentration in foods, poses health risk for sensitive peoples and are cause for a number of adverse ef-fects on human health such as rash, edema, headache, ur-ticaria, rhinitis, respiratory and digestive problems (Lade-ro et al., 2010). Some pharmacological effects of biogen-ic amines which have appropriate precursors are: liberates adrenaline and noradrenaline, stimulates both sensory and motor neurons, controls gastric acid secretion (histamine); increases the cardiac output, causes lacrimation and saliva-tion, increases respiration (tyramine); hypotension, depre-ciation of the wine aroma, potentiate the toxicity of other amines (putrescine and cadaverine); releases noradrenaline from the sympathetic nervous system, increases the blood pressure, causes migraine (phenylethylamine) etc. (EFSA, 2011; Shalabi, 1996). During wine production biogenic amines are already present in must obtained from sunny or rotten grape, be-cause from vineyard it is not possible to get grape which will be free of biogenic amines (Gloria et al., 1998). Addi-tionally the biogenic amines are accumulated during fer-mentation, from yeast (alcoholic fermentation) or bacteria (malolactic fermentation) or from other naturally present microorganisms. According to that, the wines where the amino acids are present are ideal environment for produc-tion of biogenic amines. The negative influence of biogen-ic amines on human health is the reason why the world with high velocity works on detection and determination the level of biogenic amines in different foods and wines. Although, different methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) are usually used for sep-aration and detection of biogenic amines in foods, ferment-ed foods and wines, the aim of this study is to develop and optimise the HPTLC method for qualitative and quantita-tive analysis of five biogenic amines in few red and white wines as an alternative method with several advantages. Materials and methodsSamples and chemicals: A total 12 wine samples (six red wines and six white wines) were collected from differ-ent winery and different aging period for determination of five biogenic amines. All chemicals and reagents were ana-S5 OP 220464Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 463 - 464 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsOral presentationslytical grade. The hydrochloride forms of biogenic amines were used as standards and purchased from Sigma, Merck and VWR from Germany. Stock solution of His, Cad, Put, Phe and Tyr dissolved in 10% EtOH was prepared (500 ppm) and then for determination of calibration curve were prepared standard biogenic amines solutions: 0.1 mg/L; 0.5 mg/L; 1 mg/L; 5 mg/L; 10 mg/L; 15 mg/L in which 1.6 diaminohexan was added as internal standard. Preparation of wine samples for HPTLC analysis: liq-uid-liquid extraction of biogenic amines from wines was made by following procedure: 5 mL of wine sample was mixed with 1 mL 5 M NaOH and 2 mL 5 M Na2CO3. Af-ter that were added successively three times butanol (6 Ml + 3 mL + 3 ml), and upper butanol layer was segregate and mixed 4 min. with 5 mL 0.1 M HCl. Separated lower layer was derivatised as followed: 200 mL sample was mixed in plastic tubes (2 mL) with 400 mL Dansyl chloride (50 mg/ 10 mL acetone) and 200 mL NaHCO3 (1.5 g/ 10 mL H2O). Derivatisation was conducted at 60 degC on dark place for 60 min. and after that in sample was added 500 mL toluene. The above layer was separated and put in vials for automat-ic ATS4 application of the sample on the HPTLC plate. For elution of biogenic amines was used 10 mL mobile phase: Toluene:Chloroform:Trietylamine (10:6:5 by volume) and 0.5% Tween 80. Saturation time was 40 min. at room tem-perature, on dark, avoiding air movements. Overall elution time was 20 min. Instrumentation and conditions: HPTLC plates pre-coated with silica gel 60F254 (20 cm x 10 cm) from Merck (Germany) were used as the stationary phase. The samples were sprayed on the HPTLC plate (spray-on technique) with the help of a sample applicator AUTOMATIC TLC SAMPLER 4 (ATS4, CAMAG). The chromatogram was developed in horizontal developing chamber (CAMAG). Detection of components from developed HPTLC plates was made with fluorescence Vilber Lourmat detector. Ob-tained chromatograms were analyzed by software packag-es Infinity 15.01 and Tina.Results and discussionBiogenic amines are of increasing interest to the wine industry due to proposed regulatory issues. Although HPTLC technique is relatively simple, it is difficult to make directly separations of biogenic amines from com-plex wine matrix. For effectively separation of biogenic amines and solve the problem with effect of wine matrix into qualitative and quantitative routine analysis two deri-vatisation agents FMOC-CL (9-fluoroenylmethyl chloro-formate) and DAN-CL (dansyl chloride) were investigat-ed. After derivatisations and liquid-liquid extraction, bio-genic amines in wine samples were simultaneously anal-ysed by using CAMAG ATS 4 automatic sampler on pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 plate and Vilber Louromat fluo-rescent detector. After analysis of obtained results was con-cludes that second development derivatisation and modifi-cated liquid-liquid extraction protocol allowed effectively HPTLC separations and identification of biogenic amines in complex wine (red and white) matrix in concentration from 0.1 to 15 mg/mL. Results of analysis shown that all red wine samples had higher level of biogenic amines than white wines. The validated method displayed excellent se-lectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and ro-bustness.ConclusionAccording to the known literature data, analysis of bio-genic amines by HPTLC method in wines has been used for the first time in Republic of Macedonia. The optimised HPTLC method compared with HPLC is less expensive for routine analyses of wines and enables reducing the use of organic solvents for derivatisation and for mobile phase, and provides an opportunity for determination of biogen-ic amines without higher interference with the compounds from the complex red or white wine matrix. In conclusion, the proposed HPTLC method is suitable for application in analysis of biogenic amines in differ-ent wines and could be considered as an alternative meth-od and an important tool in routine analysis of biogenic amines in wine.

Recently, there has been a considerable interest in extracts and essential oils from common culinary herbs, spices and aromatic plants with established antimicrobial and antioxidant potency. Among all, some representatives of the Lamiaceae family (oregano, marjoram, savory, sage, rosemary, thyme, basil ect. ), possessing high polyphenols content and vol-atile compounds, are often used to prevent different meet products from food born microorganisms or to stabilize fat and fat-containing foods.
