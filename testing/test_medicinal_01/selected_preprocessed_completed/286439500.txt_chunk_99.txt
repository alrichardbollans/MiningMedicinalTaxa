Significant differencesbetween the three A. laxmannii extracts were observed: allfive sterols were identified in CE, whereas the EE containsb-sitosterol, stigmasterol, ergosterol and brassicasterol and PEEcontains campesterol, stigmasterol, ergosterol and brassicasterol.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7259fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 9Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiThe A. laxmannii CE was the richest in phytosterols, withb-sitosterol as major compound in very high concentration(11589.96 +- 8.66 ug/mL), while in EE it was found in smallerquantities (367.24 +- 2.97 ug/mL), and in PEE campesterol wasthe main sterol (598.04 +- 4.22 ug/mL). The concentrations ofstigmasterol, ergosterol, and brassicasterol were comparable in allthree extracts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reporton phytosterols from A. laxmannii aerial parts extracts. Previousstudies showed the presence of stigmasterol and b-sitosterol inother Ajuga species, such as A. bracteosa, A. relicta, A. taiwanensis(Israili and Lyoussi, 2009).Identification and Quantification ofIridoidsIridoids are important compounds for the genus Ajuga, andmany Ajuga species contain the iridoid glycoside harpagide(Manguro et al., 2011; Mamadalieva et al., 2013). The mainknown ethnopharmacological indications for Ajuga species areoedema, hypertension, fever, intestinal and biliary disorders,ulcer, they are used as antipyretic, diuretic, and astringent(Toiu et al., 2017), and several studies have shown that iridoidglycosides in Ajuga species are linked to this therapeutic effects(Makni et al., 2013; Hailu and Engidawork, 2014). The HPLC-MSresults from the present study show the characterization of Ajugalaxmannii aerial parts in five commercially available iridoidglycosides, namely aucubin, catalpol, harpagide, harpagoside,and 8-O-acetylharpagide. From a pharmaceutical point ofview, the concentrations of the compounds determined inplant extract cannot be neglected as they are directly linkedto their pharmaceutical efficacy and effectiveness. 8-O-acetylharpagide was the major compound found in ethanolextract (266.3 +- 3.92 ug/mL extract), followed by harpagide(87.4 +- 2.39 ug/mL extract). The concentrations of aucubinand catalpol (7.2 +- 0.41 and 3.1 +- 0.23 ug/mL ethanol extract,respectively) were significantly lower than the other iridoids.We observed that A. laxmannii aerial parts ethanol extractcontains higher amounts of iridoids than methanol extract(Table 5). As far as one can tell, this is the first report of arapid, simple and highly accurate HPLC-MS/MS method for theidentification and quantification of iridoids from A. laxmanniiextracts.Antioxidant ActivityDPPH and ABTS Radical Scavenging ActivitySeveral studies showed that the number and position ofthe substituents on the aromatic ring affects the antioxidantproperties of phenolics; different substituents affect the reactivityand thus, the antioxidant capacity of the phenolic compounds(Shahidi and Ambigaipalan, 2015).The DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays are reliableand commonly used methods for evaluation of the radicalscavenging activity. These measurements are based on thereduction of radical species by electron-transferring or hydrogen-donating radical scavengers. DPPHrmethod is used for anionradicals and ABTSr+ is used for cation radicals. DPPH r is astable free radical, the largest absorbance occurs at 517 nm,and when it reacts with antioxidants free radicals its absorbancedecreases.TABLE 5 | The quantification of iridoids in A. laxmannii extracts (ug/mL extract).Extract Harpagide Aucubin Catalpol Harpagoside 8-O-acetyl-harpagideA. laxmannii EE 87.4 +- 2.39 7.2 +- 0.41 3.1 +- 0.23 37.2 +- 2.35 266.3 +- 3.92A. laxmannii ME 76.5 +- 2.01 6.9 +- 0.37 2.7 +- 0.19 29.1 +- 1.98 241.4 +- 3.65Values are the mean +- SD (n = 3).TABLE 6 | DPPH, TEAC, EPR activity of A. laxmannii (mean +- SD).Sample DPPH IC50 (ug/mL) EE DPPH IC50 (ug/mL) ME TEAC mg TE/g dw EPR mg FS/25uL EPR mg FS/g dwA. laxmannii 22.64 +- 0.88 24.89 +- 0.83 71.07 +- 2.40 0.266 98.073 +- 1.23Trolox 11.2 +- 0.21Values are the mean +- SD (n = 3).TABLE 7 | Antibacterial activity of A. laxmannii extracts (MIC, MBC).Bacterial strains MIC (mg/mL) MBC (mg/mL) Gentamycin (ug/mL)ME EE ME EES. aureus 1.56 0.78 3.12 1.56 0.038P. aeruginosa 3.12 3.12 6.25 6.25 1.2L. monocytogenes 6.25 6.25 12.5 12.5 0.076E. coli 6.25 6.25 12.5 12.5 1.2S. typhimurium 6.25 6.25 12.5 12.5 2.4Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7260fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 10Toiu et al.

In comparison with other research, A. laxmanniishowed a higher antiradical capacity. For example, a studyconcerning antioxidant capacity of A. turkestanica reporteda value of 57.84 +- 4.19 ug/mL (Mamadalieva et al., 2013),whereas a similar study concerning A. reptans reported aslightly higher value (65.7 +- 3.82 ug/mL) (Ono et al., 2011).A similar antiradical activity was reported by Movahhedinet al. (2016) for A. chamaecistus subsp. scoparia (Boiss.) Rech.f. (22.69+- 1.30 ug/mL).2,2'-Azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)(ABTS) is another free radical used for evaluation of antioxidantcapacity. In the ABTSr+ (TEAC) scavenging assay, the valueof antiradical capacity of A. laxmannii ethanol extract was71.07 +- 2.40 mg TE/g extract (Table 6), which is higherthan the one reported by Movahhedin et al. (2016) forA. chamaecistus subsp. scoparia (Boiss.) Rech.f. (53.87+- 2.11 mgTE/g extract).Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)SpectroscopyTo support the results from the TEAC assay, the Ajuga laxmanniiethanol extract was additionally analyzed using EPR with Fremy'ssalt as a stable radical. EPR is a very common method toassess the antioxidant activity of different samples. The mainadvantage of this assay is the matrix-independent measurementof the reaction between potential antioxidants and radicals inan electro-magnetic field instead of the absorbance of light(Yu and Cheng, 2008). The degraded amount of Fremy's saltafter 30 min incubation time was 98.07 +- 1.23 mg FS/gextract (Table 6). The EPR is a common, well-characterized,established methodology for detecting radicals and their kinetics.Unfortunately, it is not so frequently used in combinationwith other assays to detect the overall antioxidant activity.Therefore, in this case, a comparison with the results ofFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7261fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 11Toiu et al.

The antimicrobial effect was measured bymicrodilution assay, and the determination of MIC (mg/mL) andMBC (mg/mL) was assessed.The MIC values obtained for the ethanol extract rangedfrom 0.78 to 6.25 mg/mL, and from 1.56 to 6.25 mg/mL forthe methanol extract of A. laxmannii.

The best antimicrobial activityagainst S. aureus is associated with A. laxmannii ethanol extract(MIC value = 0.78 mg/mL and MBC value = 1.56 mg/mL). Theless susceptible strains were: Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichiacoli and Salmonella typhimurium, for both methanol and ethanolextracts. Previous studies showed a similar trend in terms ofMIC and MBC for A. reptans (Toiu et al., 2017). Accordingto Salvat et al. (2004), herbal extracts with MIC values lessthan/around 0.50 mg/mL indicate good antimicrobial effect.Consequently, the results presented herein showed moderateantibacterial activity.Generally, the bacterial strains were more sensitive to ethanolextract of A. laxmannii. Considering HPLC-MS results presentedin this study, we can derive some assumptions regardingantibacterial activity of A. laxmannii aerial parts.
