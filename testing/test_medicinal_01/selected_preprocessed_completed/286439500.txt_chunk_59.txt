Kiss 1*1 Department of Pharmacognosy and Molecular Basis of Phytotherapy, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland,2 Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies of Polish Academy of Sciences, Lodz, PolandAim of the study: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects ofphytochemically characterized extracts connected with the traditional use (infusionsand ethanolic extracts) of different parts of Syringa vulgaris (common lilac) on thepro-inflammatory functions of neutrophils. Active compounds were isolated from themost promising extract(s) using bioassay-guided fractionation, and their activity andmolecular mechanisms of action were determined.Methods: The extracts were characterized using a HPLC-DAD- MSn method.The effects on ROS, MMP-9, TNF-a, IL-8, and MCP-1 production by neutrophilswere measured using luminol-dependent chemiluminescence and enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. The effects on p38MAPK, ERK1/2, JNKphosphorylation, and NF-kB p65 translocation were determined using western blots.Results: The major compounds detected in the extracts and infusions belongto structural groups, including caffeic acid derivatives, flavonoids, and iridoids.All extracts and infusions were able to significantly reduce ROS and IL-8production. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to the isolation of the followingsecoiridoids: 2''-epiframeroside, oleonuezhenide, oleuropein, ligstroside, neooleuropein,hydroxyframoside, and framoside. Neooleuropein appeared to be the most activecompound in the inhibition of cytokine production by attenuating the MAP kinasepathways.Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that common lilac, which is a traditionallyused medicinal plant in Europe, is a valuable source of active compounds, especiallyneooleuropein.Keywords: Syringa vulgaris, Oleaceae, secoiridoids, neooleuropein, pro-inflammatory mediators, neutrophils149Woz'niak et al. Effects of Syringa Secoiridoids on Mediators of InflammationINTRODUCTIONThe Oleaceae family encompasses 25 genera and ~600 species.Members of this family include trees, shrubs, or woody climberswith almost worldwide distribution from northern temperateto southern subtropical regions, with the exception of theAntarctic. Genera include Olea (20 spp. ), Forsythia (7-11 spp. ),Fraxinus (40-70 spp. ), Syringa (20-30 spp. ), Osmanthus (15-30 spp. ), Jasminum (200-300 spp. ), Chionanthus (80-100 spp. ),and Ligustrum (40-50 spp.) (Jensen et al., 2002; Evans, 2009).In Central-Eastern Europe, only a few representatives of theOleaceae family are found: Fraxinus exelsior L., Ligustrumvulgare L., Syringa vulgaris L., and Forsythia sp. Moreover,Olea (leaves) and Fraxinus (leaves) have monographs in theEuropean Pharmacopoeia as well as European Agency EMEAmonographs. The Syringa genus is distributed in Eurasia, whichis subdivided into western (Central and Southeast Europe) andeastern zones (Central to East Asia) (Wallander and Albert,2000). Most of the species are found in Asia, while only S.vulgaris and S. josikaea are found in Europe (Jensen et al., 2002;Lendvay et al., 2016). S. vulgaris L., known as the commonlilac, is native to the Balkan peninsula and is widely cultivatedas an ornamental plant in Europe. In Poland, it has beennaturalized since the sixteenth century, where it is cultivatedbut also found in the wild (Witkowska-Zuk, 2013). In Europeanethnopharmacology, the common lilac inflorescence or leavesin the form of an infusion or alcoholic extract were used totreat gout, rheumatism and muscle/joint aches (Fournier, 1948;Hanlidou et al., 2010; Jaric' et al., 2015; Soukand and Pieroni,2016). In Poland, Bulgaria, Italy, and Greece, the flowers, leaves,bark, or fruits in the forms of infusions, decoctions, or alcoholicextracts were used as antipyretics and to treat cold, cough, etc. (Fournier, 1948; Kuznicka, 1986; Kuzniewski and Augustyn-Puziewicz, 1986; Aniol-Kwiatkowska et al., 1993; Leporattiand Ivancheva, 2003; Hanlidou et al., 2010). Locally, differentparts of the plant are used to treat toothaches, gastrointestinaldisorders, skin wounds, and other ailments (Kuznicka, 1986;Kuzniewski and Augustyn-Puziewicz, 1986; Aniol-Kwiatkowskaet al., 1993; Agelet and Valles, 2003; Hanlidou et al., 2010;Papp et al., 2014). Interestingly, in North American materiamedica (pharmacognosy) textbooks, the antipyretic use of theleaves, flowers, and fruits of the common lilac was mentioned(Lyle, 1897; Remington andWoods, 1918), and native Americansused to chew the bark or leaves for treating a sore mouth(Moerman, 1998). The Asian species are also used in traditionalmedicine to treat bronchial disease [Syringa reticulata (Blume)H. Hara leaves], lung and heart diseases (Syringa pinnatifoliaHemsl. stem), tooth pain (Syringa vetulina Kom. Bark), andas antipyretics (Syringa afghanica C.K. Schneid. leaves) (Parket al., 1999; Takenaka et al., 2002; Machida et al., 2009; Su et al.,2016).Scientific data supporting the traditional use of S. vulgarisare connected with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive and antipyretic properties (Balinet, 1971; Toth et al.,2015, 2016; Dudek et al., 2017). Moreover, information aboutthe single compounds responsible for each of these activities isscarce.The aim of the present study was to investigate the effectsof phytochemically characterized (HPLC-DAD-MSn) extractsconnected with the traditional use (infusions and ethanolicextracts) of different parts of the common lilac (bark, fruits,leaves and flowers) on the pro-inflammatory functions ofneutrophils, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production,metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and tumornecrosis factor (TNF-a) release. We isolated active compoundsfrom the most promising extracts using bioassay-guidedfractionation. Finally, we focused on the activity and molecularmechanisms of action of the isolated compounds that were ableto regulate neutrophil inflammation. The biological activitiesof single compounds were compared with oleuropein andligstroside, characteristic compounds from the Oleacea family(Jensen et al., 2002), and with positive control clarithromycin,a macrolide antibiotic, which has been shown to inhibit thepro-inflammatory function of neutrophils (Simpson et al., 2008;Cervin et al., 2009).MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and General ExperimentalProceduresHanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), RPMI 1640, f-MLP(formyl-Met-Leu-Phenylalanine), LPS (from Escherichia coli0111:B4), HEPES solution, and L-glutamine were purchasedfrom Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Germany).

Preparative HPLC was performed with a Shimadzu LC-20AP instrument (Japan) using a Zorbax SB-C18 column(150 x 21.2mm, 5um) (Agilent, USA) at a flow rate of20.0 mL/min. TLC was performed on Merck silica gel 60 F254 (0.25mm) plates with a dichloromethane/methanol/formicacid/water (80:25:1.5:4; v/v/v/v) solvent system. Chromatogramswere visualized by spraying with sulfuric acid (5% in methanol)followed by heating at 105*C for 10min. All solvents usedfor chromatography were of gradient grade. HPLC-DAD-MSnanalysis was performed on a UHPLC-3000 RS system (Dionex,Germany) with DAD detection and an AmaZon SL ion trap massspectrometer with an ESI interface (Bruker Daltonik GmbH,Germany). Separation was performed on a Zorbax SB-C18column (150 x 2.1mm, 1.9um) (Agilent, USA). The mobilephase consisted of 0.1%HCOOH in water (A) and 0.1%HCOOHin MeCN (B) using the following gradients: 0-60min, 5-40%Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 349150Woz'niak et al.

The LC eluate was introduced into the ESI interface withoutsplitting, and compounds were analyzed in negative ion modewith the following settings: nebulizer pressure of 40 psi; dryinggas flow rate of 9 L/min; nitrogen gas temperature of 300*C; anda capillary voltage of 4.5 kV. The mass scan ranged from 100 to2,200m/z. UV spectra were recorded in the range of 200-400 nm.The absorbance and luminescence were measured usinga BioTek microplate reader (Highland Park, USA). Flowcytometry was performed using a BD FACSCalibur apparatus(BD Biosciences, USA).Plant MaterialBark from the branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits of S. vulgarisL. were collected in May and August (fruits) 2016, from anative plant growing in Legionowo, Mazovian district, Poland(52* 23' 17.647'' N; 20* 55' 53.171'' E). The plant material wasauthenticated according to Flora Europaea (Tutin et al., 1972)by Anna K. Kiss. A voucher specimen (no. SV052015) has beendeposited in the Plant Collection, Department of Pharmacognosyand Molecular Basis of Phytotherapy, Medical University ofWarsaw, Poland (Figure 1S).Extract Preparation and PhytochemicalCharacterization by HPLC-DAD-MS/MSInfusions (Aqueous Extracts)Air-dried plant materials (5 g) were poured with boiling water(250mL), covered, and allowed to stand for 15min. Extracts werethen filtered and lyophilized, resulting in the following aqueousextract masses: bark- 0.52 g, fruit- 0.48 g, flower- 1.69 g, and leaf-1.04 g.Ethanolic ExtractsThe air-dried plant materials (2 g) were extracted with 60%ethanol (v/v, 1:20) in a water bath (70*C) for 1 h. Then, extractswere filtered, the ethanol was evaporated, and the water residueswere lyophilized, resulting in the following ethanolic extractmasses: bark- 0.25 g, fruit- 0.21 g, flower- 0.58 g and leaf- 0.51 g.The extracts were characterized using an HPLC-DAD-MS/MSmethod. The presence of substances in extracts was confirmedby comparing the retention times and spectra (UV, MS, MS/MS)with standards and/or published data.Bioassay-Guided Isolation of ActiveCompounds From Leaf ExtractThe air-dried plant material (100 g) was crushed and extractedthree times with 75% methanol (1:10) at 70*C for 1 h each time(3 times). The methanol from combined extracts was evaporatedunder reduced pressure, and the aqueous residue was lyophilizedto yield 40 g of extract. The crude extract was subjected to DiaionHP-20 (Supelco) column chromatography (45x 5 cm) and elutedwith an H2O-MeOH gradient (100:0- 0:100, v/v) in 5 steps of1.5 L each to obtain 35 fractions, which were pooled into 6 mainfractions (F1-F6) based on their TLC and HPLC profiles. Theactivity of the fractions toward the inhibition of IL-8 and TNF-a was tested at a concentration of 50ug/mL.
