To each well of a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-one, Cellstar 650185, Kremsmunster, Austria), 150 uL of the cellsuspension was transferred for spheroid formation within 48 h.Then, MCF-7 spheroids were washed in PBS and transferred toCellTrackerTM green (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Karlsruhe,Germany) stained LEC monolayers that had been seeded into24-well plates (Costar 3524, Sigma) in 2 mL EGM2 MV medium(Vonach et al., 2011).Circular Chemorepellent-Induced Defect(CCID) AssayAfter 4 h of incubation of the co-cultures of MCF-7 spheroids(3,000 cells/spheroid) and the LEC monolayer, the size ofCCIDs in the LEC monolayer underneath the MCF-7 spheroidswas photographed with an Axiovert (Zeiss, Jena, Germany)fluorescence microscope to visualize CellTrackerTM (green)stained LECs underneath the spheroids (Madlener et al., 2010).CCID areas were calculated with the Axiovision Re. 4.5 software(Zeiss, Jena, Germany). MCF-7 spheroids were treated withsolvent (ethanol) as negative control. The CCID areas of at least15 spheroids per experiment were measured.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONFrom the methanolic extract of the aerial parts from S. lucida,apolar compounds were depleted by extraction with petroleumether. After subsequent partition with chloroform and ethylacetate, the two organic fractions and the residue of the aqueousphase were tested in the CCID assay. The crude methanol extractsignificantly and linearly inhibited CCID formation betweenconcentrations of 0.25-1 mg/mL (Figure 1). At a concentrationof 0.25 mg/mL, the CF seemed to be even more effective than0.25 mg/mL of the methanol extract; however, this differencewas not significant. The EF was only active at 1 mg/mL and theAF was inactive at the tested concentrations.

Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assaywas chosen for further separation by CC on silica and five ofthe resulting sub-fractions (A-E) were active in the CCID assaywith sub-fraction A exhibiting the strongest inhibition (Figure 2).The EF was separated by size exclusion chromatography followedby solid phase extraction or another subsequent size exclusionchromatography. Due to the lower activity of the EF in theCCID assay, these sub-fractions were submitted to chemicalinvestigations only.The processes resulted in the elucidation of 14 compounds,one of which is a new natural product (Figure 3). The 13known compounds were identified by chromatographic, massspectrometric and/or spectroscopic dereplication with authenticsamples or data from literature. This led to the elucidation ofseven flavonoids. The widespread natural compounds astragalin(1), luteolin-7-O-glucoside (8), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (6),and rutin (7) were confirmed by TLC- and LC-DAD comparisonwith the authentic substances. To the best of our knowledge,only the two latter have been reported in the genus Scrophulariauntil now, namely, in Scrophularia ilwensis C. Koch (Calis et al.,1993). Two further, less prevalent flavonoids, nepitrin (4) andhomoplantaginin (2), had been isolated from S. ningpoensis (Liet al., 2009) and nepitrin also from S. striata (Monsef-Esfahaniet al., 2010) before. 1H-NMR- and 13C-NMR data of 2 correlatedexcellently with the data published earlier for homoplantaginin(Wang et al., 1998; Dawa et al., 2009). Hispidulin (9) was detectedfor the first time in a Scrophularia species and elucidated byLC-DAD comparison and LC-MS data.A new flavonoid (3) was identified by thorough MS and NMRexperiments: a molecular formula of C24H24O12 was determinedfrom the HRESIMS data. Fragmentation of the [M+H]+ ionat m/z 505.0 showed the loss of a 204 Da to yield a Y0 ionat m/z 301.3, which again lost a CH*3 in MS3, typical for amethoxy group bound to an aromatic system. The MS2, MS3, andMS4 spectra were nearly identical to those of homoplantaginin.Fragmentation of the [M-H]- ion at m/z 503.0 confirmed thisinformation. In addition, the loss of 60 Da (CH3COOH) inMS2 indicated acetylation of the glucose of homoplantaginin.The signals of 3 in the 1H-NMR spectrum excellently correlatedwith those of compound 2 (Table 1), despite a large downfieldshift of the proton at C-2'' in the sugar for 1.55 ppm. Thesignals of the protons at C-1'' and C-3'' were shifted downfieldfor 0.24 and 0.22 ppm, respectively, as well. Additionally, fromthe singlet at d = 2.038 ppm, linkage of an acetyl group wasdeduced. The connection of an additional acetyl group in position2'' of homoplantaginin was confirmed by the 13C-NMR data.The signals of C-1'' and C-3'' were shifted upfield for 2.28 andTABLE 1 | 1H NMR and 13C NMR data of compounds 2 and 3 in DMSO-d6.Compound 2 Compound 3Position 1H (ppm) JH.H (Hz) 13C (ppm) 1H (ppm) JH.H (Hz) 13C (ppm)2 C - - 164.3 - - 164.43 CH 6.86 s 102.7 6.87 s 102.74 C - - 182.3 - - 182.34a C - - 105.7 - - 106.15 C - - 152.5 - - 152.6OH 12.96 s - 12.97 s -6 C - - 132.5 - - 132.5CH3 3.77 s 60.3 3.65 s 60.27 C - - 156.5 - - 155.98 CH 7.02 94.3 7.03 s 94.78a C - - 152.1 - - 152.01' C - - 121.0 - - 120.92'/6' CH 7.95 d 8.8 128.6 7.94 d 8.9 128.63'/5' CH 6.94 d 8.8 116.0 6.94 d 8.9 116.04' C - - 161.4 - - 161.51'' CH 5.11 d 7.1 100.2 5.35 d 8.1 97.92'' CH 3.34 dd 7.1/9.6 73.2 4.89 dd 8.1/9.6 73.3C - - - - 169.3CH3 - - 2.04 s 20.83'' CH 3.32 dd 9.6/9.2 76.7 3.54 dd 9.6/9.1 73.84'' CH 3.21 dd 9.2/9.6 69.5 3.31 dd 9.1/9.7 69.65'' CH 3.47 ddd 9.6/ 6.0/2.1 77.3 3.58 ddd 9.7/6.0/2.1 77.56''a CH2 3.73 dd 2.1/11.6 60.6 3.77 dd 2.1/11.8 60.4b 3.49 dd 6.0/11.6 3.53 dd 6.0/11.8Further OH signals 10.405.435.124.6310.435.394.77Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 304238fphar-09-00304 March 28, 2018 Time: 17:7 # 7Lewenhofer et al. Scrophularia lucida in CCID Assay2.95 ppm, respectively. Signals of an acetyl group occurred atd = 169.26 ppm (quarternary C) and d = 20.82 ppm (methyl C).An HMBC crosspeak from the CH3 protons to the C-2'' finallyproofed the connectivity. Thus, compound 3 was unambiguouslyidentified as 2''-O-acetyl-homoplantaginin.The phenylpropanoid verbascoside, which had been detectedin many species of the Scrophulariaceae family (see, e.g., Zhanget al., 2013; Pasdaran et al., 2016, 2017; Venditti et al., 2016), wasisolated from S. lucida as well and identified by HPLC-DAD andMS.The genus is well-known for synthesizing a broad rangeof iridoids (De Santos Galindez et al., 2002) and two suchcompounds were isolated from and two further ones tentativelyidentified in the CF.The major iridoid was scrovalentinoside (14). The compoundwas elucidated by MS and NMR experiments (see SupplementaryMaterial). The spectroscopic data were in excellent accordancewith those published after isolation of the compound fromS. auriculata L. ssp. pseudoauriculata (Senn.) Bolos et Vigo(Giner et al., 1998) and from S. nodosa L. (Miyase and Mimatsu,1999). A second iridoid was unambiguously elucidated askoelzioside (13) based on MS experiments and the analogyof the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data as reported for thecompound, until now only known from Scrophularia koelziiL. (Bhandari et al., 1992) and Scrophularia deserti Del. (Ahmed et al., 2003).
