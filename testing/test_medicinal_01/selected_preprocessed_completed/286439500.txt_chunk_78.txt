The relaxantresponses obtained were as follows, 0.3 uM: 19.7+- 4.7% (N = 6);1 uM: 29.1 +- 3.5% (N = 6); 3 uM: 30.1 +- 4.8% (N = 7); 10 uM:92.9 +- 4.2% (N = 6), where, as also elsewhere in this paper,relaxation to the pre-histamine baseline was taken as 100%.Effects on Guinea Pig Urinary BladderThe effects of the RC extract and the essential oil were tested onguinea pig urinary bladder strips as well. RC crude extract evokedconcentration-dependent contraction at 20 and 200 ug/ml(Table 8 and Figure 4 for 200 ug/ml). The solvent of the extracthad no contractile effect on the bladder (N = 4). The effect ofthe 200 ug/ml extract was diminished (approximately halved) byin vitro capsaicin pretreatment (Table 8). Contractile responseswere compared to the maximal spasm evoked by 100 mM of KClat the end of the experiment.To study the relaxant effect of the crude extract, thebladder strips were sub-maximally pre-contracted with histamine(1-3 uM). Atropine and tetrodotoxin were present in the bathingfluid. Since excitatory purinergic mechanisms are present in thebladder, a,b-methylene ATP desensitization (10 + 10 uM for10 min each) was also performed. RC crude extract had noFIGURE 4 | Contraction, in response to 200 ug/ml RC extract (added at thesquare symbol), on the guinea pig urinary bladder detrusor strip.

The solvent itself (1 ul/ml DMSO) exerted noeffect.Roman chamomile essential oil caused no contraction ina concentration of 10 ug/ml. Similarly to the extract, RC oilexerted a moderate relaxing effect on the pre-contracted bladder:17.9 +- 6.1% and 34.1 +- 5.8% relaxation was evoked with 1 and10 ug/ml, N = 7 and 6, respectively.Effects on Rat GastrointestinalPreparationsThe relaxant effect of RC essential oil was confirmed onlongitudinally oriented preparations of the rat gastrointestinaltract. Rat whole ileum and distal colon preparations arecharacterized by high intrinsic tone, therefore no pre-contraction was needed. RC oil (10 ug/ml) induced relaxation(41.4 +- 7.4% and 21.8 +- 3.7%, N = 7 and 10, respectively,on these preparations, where 100% means the relaxantresponse to 3 uM isoprenaline, given at the end of theexperiment). A concentration of 1 ug/ml was barely effective.No contractile effect was observed. Rat stomach fundus stripswere pre-contracted with 0.1-0.3 uM acetylcholine. RC oilproduced relaxation (on average 44 and 70.3% relaxationin response to concentrations of 1 and 10 ul/ml, N = 4each, where 100% means relaxation to the pre-acetylcholinelevel).Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 323200fphar-09-00323 April 4, 2018 Time: 18:30 # 9Sandor et al. Spasmolytic Effect of Roman ChamomileEffects on Human Jejunal PreparationsIn untreated longitudinally oriented human jejunal preparationsRC crude extract induced transient contraction amounting to12.4+- 3.5% and 30.5+- 0.6% at 20 and 200 ug/ml concentrations,respectively (N = 8). Atropine- and tetrodotoxin-pretreatedpreparations were pre-contracted with PGF2a (1 or 2 uM).RC extract showed a concentration-dependent relaxant effect(25.8 +- 4.3% at 20 ug/ml, N = 8; 68.5 +- 8.5% at 60 ug/ml,N = 7; 50.8 +- 3.7% at 200 ug/ml, N = 9). RC essential oilproduced no contraction. A lasting relaxant effect was detectedon pre-contracted preparations (in the presence of atropine andtetrodotoxin). The relaxant effect reached 26.9+- 5.2% at 1 ug/mland 81.4 +- 8.2% at 10 ug/ml concentrations (N = 8 and 7,respectively).In untreated circularly oriented human jejunal preparationsthe RC crude extract evoked transient contraction (43.4 +- 10%at 200 ug/ml, N = 5), while the 20 ug/ml concentration samplehad a negligible effect (2.8% contraction on 5 preparations). RCextract induced relaxation in PGF2a-precontracted preparations(in the presence of atropine and tetrodotoxin). This effect reached45% with 60 ug/ml concentration (N = 4), while a concentrationof 200 ug/ml produced full relaxation (N = 6), where a relaxationto the pre-prostaglandin level was taken as 100%.The solvent itself (1 ul/ml DMSO) did not evoke eithercontraction or relaxation on this preparation (N = 4-6).DISCUSSIONThe experiments presented here have been carried out with RC,which has been used traditionally for the symptomatic treatmentof mild, spasmodic and other gastrointestinal complaints,however, the presumed smooth muscle-relaxant effect has notbeen confirmed experimentally. The aim of our study was toinvestigate the effect of a traditionally used extract of the plant,its fractions and the essential oil of the plant, as well as of four ofits flavonoid components.The phytochemical analysis of the extract revealed thepresence of flavonoids in the plant, four of which (apigenin,luteolin, eupafolin, and hispidulin) were isolated and identified.The hydroethanolic extract was fractionated on polyamideto gain fractions with different flavonoid content in orderto examine the role of these compounds in the effect onsmooth muscles. The flavonoid content of the extract andfractions was analyzed by HPLC. The flavonoid content of theextract was fractionated successfully, fractions F80, F100 (andto some extent F60) containing higher amounts of flavonoidsthan the crude extracts. The flavonoid pattern of fractionsalso differed. The essential oil analyzed by us belongs to thechemotype characterized by the predominance of methallylangelate.Pharmacological experiments were carried out with thehydroethanolic extract, its fractions (F20, F40, F60, F80, andF100), four flavonoids (apigenin, eupafolin, hispidulin, andluteolin) and the essential oil of the plant on differentsmooth muscles in vitro. The hydroethanolic extract of RChas both stimulatory and relaxant effects on guinea pigileum. The moderate, transient stimulatory activity resultsfrom the activation of cholinergic neurons, as confirmedby its inhibition by tetrodotoxin (an inhibitor of neuronalvoltage-sensitive Na+ channels) and atropine (antagonist onmuscarinic receptors for acetylcholine). Although capsaicin,a stimulant of a certain class of sensory receptors (throughwhich it evokes a "local efferent" response) shows a similarcholinergic, neurogenic effect in guinea pig small intestinepreparations (see Bartho et al., 2004 for review), a functionalblockade of capsaicin-sensitive nerve endings by capsaicinpretreatment failed to inhibit the contractile action of RCextract. The contractile action of RC extract was moderately,yet significantly reduced by the cyclooxygenase inhibitorindomethacin, which may indicate a modulatory role ofendogenous prostanoids. Other pharmacological inhibitorstested had no contraction-reducing effect, therefore it isproposed that neither endogenous serotonin, nor PPADS-sensitive purinergic mechanisms play a role in the excitatoryaction of RC extract. It should be noted that both serotonin andATP or the P2X receptor agonist a,b-methylene ATP are ableto evoke cholinergic contractions in guinea pig ileum (Benkoet al., 2005; Bartho et al., 2006; Sandor et al., 2016 for recentdata).Following the transient and mild-to-moderate stimulanteffect, the RC crude extract exhibited a sustained relaxanteffect on the guinea pig ileum in the presence of tetrodotoxinand atropine, and preliminary experiments indicated a similarrelaxant effect also in the absence of atropine and tetrodotoxin.Yet, atropine and tetrodotoxin were included into theseexperiments for creating a methodologically clear situation,where an initial, neuronally mediated excitatory action wouldhardly interfere with the relaxant one. The concentrationsof the extract causing relaxation were roughly the same asthose causing contraction. Based on these data we proposethat the site of action for the relaxant effect of RC is onthe smooth muscle itself. Neither the adrenergic b-receptorantagonist propranolol nor the NO synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine significantly reduced the relaxant effect ofthe RC extract, hence, no evidence was found for thesemechanisms to be involved in the relaxant response. In fact,a direct relaxant effect of the extract was demonstrated on allgastrointestinal preparations tested, including human and ratgastrointestinal preparations, as well as in guinea pig bladder.In preparations with high intrinsic tone (rat ileum and ratcolon), relaxant activity was practically the only response to beseen.Different RC extract fractions evoked both contraction andrelaxation on guinea pig ileum. While there was a clear-cuttendency correlation between the flavonoid content and therelaxant effect, in case of contractile action such correlation wasnot observed (on the contrary, fractions with lower flavonoidcontent exerted slightly higher contractile activities). Fractionswith high flavonoid content (F60, F80, and F100) had remarkablerelaxant effects, whereas fractions with no (F20) or low (F40)flavonoid content exerted no such activity. The pure flavonoidsof the extract showed dual effects in the guinea pig ileum, muchsimilarly to the crude extract.

Spasmolytic Effect of Roman Chamomiledifference between the potencies of the flavonoids. This meansthat any of these flavonoids may contribute to the sustainedrelaxant and the transient contractile effect of the extract. Theessential oil of RC caused no contraction on the test preparations;nevertheless, a consistent relaxant effect was detected. This seemsto indicate that (i) chemical components responsible for thestimulant effect may be absent in the essential oil; (ii) it maybe that several types of compounds present in the extract areresponsible for the smooth muscle-relaxant action. This pointneeds to be clarified in subsequent experiments.The contraction of guinea pig bladder in response to theRC extract proved to be special, in that it was reduced by halffollowing in vitro capsaicin pretreatment. This indicates thatcapsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves of the bladder wall are in someway involved in the excitatory effect of the RC extract (see Barthoet al., 2004). Nevertheless, the RC extract and oil also inducedbladder relaxation in pre-contracted preparations.Roman chamomile extract was effective in human jejunalpreparations as well. Both an excitatory and a tetrodotoxin-and atropine-resistant relaxing effect were demonstrated, again,the smooth muscle relaxant one being more sustained than theexcitatory one. Preliminary experiments have shown that thisearly contraction is reduced by atropine. Due to limited accessto human tissue, no further analysis of these responses could beperformed.In terms of possible medical uses it may be notedthat a combination of nerve-mediated, mild-to moderateexcitatory effect and a smooth muscle-relaxant action mayeven be advantageous for some gastrointestinal problems, e.g.,diminished peristaltic activity, while for spasms in the stomach orlarge intestine it is obviously the smooth muscle relaxing activitythat offers benefits.CONCLUSIONOur results support the overall smooth muscle relaxant effect ofa hydroethanolic RC extract and of the essential oil of RC. Thepredominant effect of the extract, its fractions and flavonoids isrelaxation, being more sustained than the transient contractionobserved in some cases. This activity is in correlation withthe flavonoid content of the extract. Since the componentsof the essential oil are partly extracted with alcohols, theconstituents of the oil also contribute to the overall effectof the hydroethanolic RC extract. The extract used in ourexperiments was prepared in accordance with the EuropeanMedicines Agency monograph for this plant, therefore our studycontributes to the body of evidence relating the traditional use ofthis plant.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSZS, DK, TB, and RP carried out the organ bath experiments.
