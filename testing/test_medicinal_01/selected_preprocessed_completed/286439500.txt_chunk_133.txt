Some animal and clinicalstudies reveal positive results in models of anxiety and depression although very littleresearch has been done on molecular mechanisms. Our work consisted of evaluatingthe effects of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil on central nervous systemwell-established targets, such as MAO-A, SERT, GABAAand NMDA receptors as wellas in vitro models of neurotoxicity. The results showed that lavender essential oil and itsmain components exert affinity for the glutamate NMDA-receptor in a dose-dependentmanner with an IC50 value of 0.04ul/mL for lavender oil. In addition, lavender and linaloolwere also able to bind the serotonin transporter (SERT) whereas they did not show affinityfor GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor. In three different models of neurotoxicity, lavenderdid not enhance the neurotoxic insult and improved viability of SH-SY5Y cells treated withhydrogen peroxide. According to our data, the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effectsattributed to lavender may be due to an antagonism on the NMDA-receptor and inhibitionof SERT. This study suggests that lavender essential oil may exert pharmacologicalproperties via modulating the NMDA receptor, the SERT as well as neurotoxicity inducedby hydrogen peroxide.Keywords: essential oils, central nervous system, lavender, Lavandula angustifolia, Lavandula officinalis, SH-SY5Ycells, glutamate receptorINTRODUCTIONEssential oils have a long tradition in pharmaceutical sciences as natural products withpharmacological, cosmetic, agrochemical and nutritional applications (Bakkali et al., 2008). Theuse of EO in form of aromatherapy or phytotherapy is widely extended, some of them beingused as agents to relieve anxiety and stress (Setzer, 2009). Phytotherapy consists of the use ofmedicinal plants in order to prevent, cure or threat illnesses. Aromatherapy can be understood asa subdivision of phytotherapy and defined as the use of essential oils regarding therapeutic effects.Abbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; LEO, lavender essential oil; GABA, g-aminobutyric acid; iGLURs, ionotropicglutamate receptors; MAO-A, monoamine oxidase A; NMDA, n-methyl-D-aspartate; SERT, serotonin transporter; SSRI,selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.347Lopez et al. Lavender Pharmacological MechanismsThese products have been used for centuries and are accepted intraditional or modern healthcare systems of medicine. Medicinalplants are widely used for the treatment of central nervous systemdisorders (Wheatley, 2005) but in some cases there is still lack ofpreclinical and clinical studies.Central nervous system disorders have a great impact insociety due to a general aging process of the population as wellas lifestyle. Stress is one of the most prevalent psychologicaldisorders in developed countries leading to other clinicalfeatures, such as anxiety, insomnia or depression.Benzodiazepines (BZD) and selective serotonin reuptakeinhibitors (SSRIs) are highly prescribed as anxiolytic andantidepressant drugs, respectively. BZD, such as diazepam,lorazepam or alprazolam produce calming effects via bindingto GABAA receptors, but they may also produce somnolenceand cognitive impairment as adverse drug reactions. SSRIs(e.g., fluoxetin, paroxetin, citalopram) are prescribed asantidepressants because they are able to selectively block theserotonin transporter (SERT), but side effects include sexualdysfunction and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as suicidetendencies and sleep disorders. Both groups of medicines arealso involved in withdrawal and "rebound effects" as a result ofdiscontinuing their administration.Certain EO are being used as anxiolytic remedies and theadministration mode can be orally but also by inhalation orcombined with massage. One of the most popular essentialoils for mental disorders and anxiety is lavender (Lavandulaangustifolia Miller or Lavandula officinalis Chaix). Lavenderessential oil can be considered as one of the best-seller overthe counter herbal remedies for anxiety, stress and depression.Studies reveal high content of linalool and linalyl acetate (DaPorto et al., 2009) and international organizations, such as theWorld Health Organization (WHO), the European ScientificCooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP) or the EuropeanMedicines Agency (EMA) approve this medicinal plant to relievestress, restlessness and anxiety (Community)1.The growing awareness of the adverse effects of centralnervous system drugs has led to develop new strategies andsafer pharmacological agents in mental health. Enzymes, suchas monoamine oxidase (MAO), proteins, such as the SERT andligand-gated ion channels, such as GABAA and NMDA receptorsare therapeutic targets in neuropharmacology. With the aim tocontribute to evidence-based herbal medicine we have studiedthe effects of lavender essential oil on pharmacological targetsinvolved in anxiolytic and antidepressive properties as well asin vitromodels of neurotoxicity.METHODSLavender Essential Oil (LEO) andChemicalsPure lavender (L. angustifolia) essential oil was kindly suppliedby Pranarom International (Belgium). Isolated monoterpenes(linalool, linalyl acetate) were purchased from Fluka. Enzymes,1 Community herbal monograph on Lavandula angustifolia Mill., aetheroleum.,EMA/HMPC/143181/2010 (http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/).proteins and reagents were acquired from Sigma. Linalool andlinalyl acetate were also tested when lavender essential oil had aclear and significant activity in the assays.Chemical Profile by GC-MSAlthough the essential oils are chemically characterized byPranarom International, LEO was analyzed in the laboratory byGC-MS on an Agilent 6890N Network GC system coupled toa 5973 Network Mass Selective Detector, accelerating voltage -69.9 eV, recodingmasses of 35.00-400.00. GC conditions: injectortemperature: 150*C; temperature programme: start 50*C,20*C/min to 300*C; column: HP5MS (5% phenylmethylsiloxane)capillary, 30.0m x 250ul x 0.25um nominal. Carrier gas:helium at 1.0ml/min. A NIST library was used for comparisonof MS data.Animals and Brain MembraneHomogenatesAdult male Sprague Dawley rats were obtained from Taconic(Denmark). Ethical permission for the studies was granted by theAnimalWelfare Committee, appointed by the DanishMinistry ofJustice, and all animal procedures were carried out in compliancewith the ECDirective 86/609/EEC and theDanish laws regulatingexperiments on animals. Rats were put down by competent staff,the heads were separated from the body and the brains wereremoved whereas cerebellum was discarded. The cortex wereweighed and homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax using differentbuffers at 4*C and the tissue preparation in each case was carriedout as earlier described (Ransom and Stec, 1988). The tissuehomogenates were resuspended and stored in aliquots at -80*Cuntil use.Bioassays Regarding Serotonergic TargetsMonoamine Oxidase-A Inhibition (MAO-A Assay)The bioassay was performed in a 96-well microplate (Saabyet al., 2009). Each well contained 50ul of essential oil dilutionor DMSO as blank (making a final concentration in thewells of 0.002, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.1%), 50ul of chromogenicsolution (0.8mM vanillic acid, 417mM 4-aminoantipyrine and4 U/ml horseradish peroxidase in potassium phosphate bufferpH 7.6), 100ul of 3mM tyramine and 50ul of 8 U/ml MAO-A. Absorbance was read at 490 nm every 5min for 30min.Background interferences were deducted in the same waydescribed above but without MAO enzyme. Data was analyzedusingGraphPad Prism. IC50 values could not be obtained becausethe higest tested concentration did not reach 50% of MAOinhibition. Clorgyline was used as positive control.Serotonin Transporter Assay ([3H]-CitalopramBinding Assay)The assay was performed on the basis of themethod fromNielsenet al. (2004). 25ul of three different essential oil concentrationswere mixed with 50ul of 4 nM [3H]-Citalopram and 225ulof rat cortex suspension making a final concentration of theessential oils in the assay of 0.08, 0.4, and 0.8%. All componentswere previously dissolved in buffer (50mM Tris-base; 120mMNaCl: 5mM KCl at pH 7.5). Plastic tubes were placed on anFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 280348Lopez et al. Lavender Pharmacological Mechanismsice bath, the reagents were added and the tubes were mixedand then left at room temperature (approximately 22*C) for2 h. After incubation, 5ml of ice cold buffer were added tothe samples and they were filtered through GC-50 Advantecglass filters under vacuum and immediately washed once withadditional 5ml of ice cold buffer. Control test tubes (withbuffer instead of EO) and blind tubes (with 25ul of 120uMparoxetine instead of EO) were done in every run in orderto determine total and unspecific binding. The amount ofradioactivity was determined transferring the glass filters intoscintillation tubes and adding 4ml of Ultimo Gold XR. Thescintillation tubes were placed in the dark for 30min beforethey were measured on a Tri-CARB 2100 TR analyzer. Threeindependent experiments were performed in triplicates. Non-radioactive citalopram was used as reference. Linalool and linalylacetate were tested. The specific binding of [3H]-citalopram wasdetermined using the formula: % binding = [dpm(essential oil)-dpm(unspecific binding)/dpm(total binding)-dpm(unspeficic binding)] x100.Bioassays on Ionotropic ReceptorsAffinity for GABAA Receptor ([3H]-Ro 15-1788Binding Assay)The membrane preparation was washed with ice-cold buffer(50mM Tris-citrate pH 7.1). The suspension was centrifuged at0-4*C for 10min at 27,000 x g. The pellet was resuspended inTris-citrate buffer (2mg original tissue per ml) and used for theassay. 25ul of 3H-Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) was added to 25ulof test solutions (10, 1, and 0.1mg/ml) and 500ul of membranepreparation. Total and unspecific binding was measured usingbuffer or diazepam (1uM assay final concentration). Afterincubation for 40min in an ice bath, 5ml of ice-cold buffer wasadded to the samples and poured onto Adventic glass fiber filters(GC-50) under vacuum, and immediately washed with another5ml of ice-cold buffer. The amount of radioactivity of the filterswas measured by conventional liquid scintillation counting usingUltimo Gold XR as scintillation fluid. Clonazepam was used aspositive control.Affinity for NMDA Receptor ([3H]-CGP39653 BindingAssay)Affinity for native NMDA receptors was determined using 2 nM[3H]-CGP 39653 (Sills et al., 1991) with some modification. Onthe day of the assay, frozen membranes were quickly thawedand homogenized in 30 volumes of ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer,pH 7.4 (50mM containing 2.5mM CaCl2), and centrifuged(48,000 x g for 10min). This step was repeated three times. Thefinal pellet was re-suspended in ice-cold buffer, correspondingto approximately 0.4-0.5mg protein/ml. Binding was carriedout in aliquots consisting of 25uL [3H]-CGP 39653, 25uL testsolution, and 200uL membrane suspension and incubated at 0*for 60min. Non-specific binding was determined using 1mM(S)-Glu. Binding was terminated by filtration through WhatmanGF/C filters using a 96-well Packard Filter-Mate Cell Harvesterand filters were washed with 3x 250 uL of ice-cold buffer. Afterdrying, 30uL Microscint 0 (Perkin-Elmer) per well was addedand the filter was counted on a Topcounter (Perkin-Elmer).Linalool and linalyl acetate were also tested in this assay.Neuroprotection on SH-SY5Y CellsSH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cell CultureCells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, ref. 41966-029) containingphenol red (PR), L-Glutamine (1mM) and sodium pyruvate(1mM) and was supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), penicillin(100 U/mL, Gibco) and streptomycin (100 U/mL, Gibco). Cellswere maintained at 37*C in saturated humidity (5% CO2). Non-differentiated cells were plated on 48-well plates (Corning), at adensity of 5x 104 cells per well and were used 48 h after seeding.Ab25-35SolubleSpecies PreparationAb25-35fragment was purchased from Sigma-Aldrichlaboratories (ref. A4559-1MG). 1mg of Ab25-35 fragmentwas dissolved in 1mL of type II water and was frozen at -20*Cuntil further use. Different concentrations of Ab25-35 (5, 10and 15uM) were incubated in DMEM phenol red free (Gibco,31053-028) at 37*C for 3 days to obtain the oligomeric forms.Cell Treatment and MTT Cell Viability AssaySH-SY5Y cells were treated with either different LEOconcentration (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and1uL/mL) or incubationtime (0, 2, and 24 h), followed by hydrogen peroxide (100, 200,400, 800, and 1,600uM), malonate (0 or 50mM) or Ab25-35(5,10, and 15uM).Cell viability was examined by the 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. MTT assayis a colorimetric assay for measuring the activity of cellularenzymes in living cells in response to potential toxic. After thecell treatment, culture medium was replaced by a solution of5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM (Gibco, 31053-028).Cells were incubated with MTT solution for 2 h in the cellincubator (5% CO2 and 37*C). Then, the MTT solution wasdiscarded and DMSO was added to the wells. Aliquots weretransferred to a 96-well plate, and absorbance was measured at595 nm in a plate reader. Results were expressed as percentagesof non-treated control cells.Statistical AnalysesData are expressed as mean +- SE (figures) or as mean +-SD(tables) of at least three independent experiments performed indifferent days and in triplicates.
