Food, Wild Plants, Russian Pharmacopoeiacultural knowledge of their harvesting, preparation, cooking andother forms of processing.EDIBLE WILD PLANTS-APPROACHESAND METHODS FOR ASSESSING USESAND EVIDENCEBased on the State Pharmacopoeia of the USSR, we selectedseventy wild species that are used as food in Russia andsystematically searched the scientific literature (publishedbetween 1878-2016) for data using the Russia-wide appliedonline database E-library.ru, library catalogs of public librariesin St-Petersburg, the databases Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed,and search engine Google Scholar. The primary search criterionwas a food application of medicinal plants.Edible wild plants include food categories familiar toeveryone: green vegetables and potherbs, wild berries and fruits,beverages, tea and coffee substitutes, seasonings and spices,sweets, bread surrogates, plants used for preserves. Family namesof the species are based onwww.theplantlist.org database with thenames in the Russian Pharmacopoeia given in brackets (Table 1).Also included are the applications in food.Green Vegetables and PotherbsThis category includes the majority of examined plants.Especially in the spring or at the beginning of their growingseason, many wild species produce tender, edible leaves andshoots, and flowers at the beginning of flowering. Some,like shepherd's-purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik. ),cornflower (Cyanus segetum Hill., syn. Centaurea cyanus L.), andbroadleaf plantain (Plantago major L.) can be eaten raw, afterbeing peeled from soil (Sokolov, 1985, 1990; Tcherepnin, 1987;Grisjuk et al., 1989; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001; Turneret al., 2011), whereas others, like stinging nettles (Urtica dioicaL.) must be steamed or cooked in some way (Litvintsev andKoscheev, 1988; Fedorov, 1984; Toren, 1996). These plants areused for salads, added to soups, borsch, omelets, cooked and usedas a garnish.Many edible greens emerging right after the melting of snoware particularly important for their vitamin C content in thespring and traditionally have been used to prevent and alleviatescurvy. In particularly, soup and borsch with nettles are popularnot only among rural but also many urban people (Gubanovet al., 1976; Koscheev, 1981; Tcherepnin, 1987; Litvintsev andKoscheev, 1988).Tonic properties of shoots of aralia (Aralia elata (Miq.)Seem. )were recognized by Ussuri aborigines (Far East). Young shots nomore than 20 cm are cooked and served as garnish (Izmodenov,1989).Wild Berries and FruitsPresumably, wild berries and fruits are the most favored group ofedible medicinal plants in Russia, and today probably used mostfrequently. The wild fruits most commonly collected in Russiainclude bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), hawthorn (Crataegusspp. ), and rose hips (Rosa spp.) (Gubanov et al., 1976; Koscheev,1981; Sokolov, 1987; Tcherepnin, 1987; Grisjuk et al., 1989;Efremova, 1992; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001; Soenov, 2002;Luczaj et al., 2012; Soukand et al., 2013; Novruzov, 2014). Allof them are consumed fresh, but some are also preserved forthe winter by making jams, marmalade or pasteurized compotes(Turova and Sapozhnikova, 1989). Furthermore, they are usedto make beverages. Some berries are popular among all groupsof the population (like bilberry), other species that once wereused as a valuable food source in some regions of Russia haveseen that food use diminished because of the bitter or astringenttaste as such as guelder rose (Viburnum opulus L.), bird cherry(Prunus padus L.), and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) (Baikov,1968; Rubtsov, 1971; Gubanov et al., 1976; Sokolov, 1985, 1990;Tcherepnin, 1987; Grisjuk et al., 1989; Toren, 1996; Smertinaet al., 2011). The berries and seeds of Schisandra chinensis(Turcz.) Bail. were eaten by Nanai (Goldes or Samagir) huntersfrom Far Eastern Russia since "it gives forces to follow a sableall the day without food" and were acclaimed as a tonic, toimprove night vision and to reduce hunger, thirst and exhaustion(Panossian and Wikman, 2008).BeverageAerial parts, leaves or flowers are used mainly for makingbeverages, while the underground parts are used rarely. Aromaticplants belonging to the Asteraceae and Lamiaceae are usedto sweeten or to flavor alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages:yarrow (Achillea millefolium L.), tansy (Tanacetum vulgareL. ), and oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) (Timoshenko, 1940;Wustenfeld and Gesler, 1959; Koscheev, 1981; Berson, 1991;Sokolov, 1991; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya, 2001; Soenov, 2002;Kalle and Soukand, 2012; Soukand et al., 2013). Juicy fruits ofspecies belonging to the Rosaceae (rowan and bird cherry) areused often for coloring of alcoholic beverages and giving a morepronounced flavor. The fruits of these plants are used both inhome made alcoholic beverages as well as in wine- and brewingindustry for the production of liqueurs, bitters, wines, and beers(Wustenfeld and Gesler, 1959; Gubanov et al., 1976; Koscheev,1981; Tcherepnin, 1987; Toren, 1996; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya,2001). Making liqueurs out of rowan berries seems to be an oldhabit that has been in vogue in Russia (Timoshenko, 1940). Thearoma is an important attribute of refreshing soft drinks (kvass,lemonade, and fruit morse), which are popular in the summerseason.Tonic properties of ginseng and aralia were recorded in the FarEastern Russia by hunters and their roots were regularly added toalcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and balsams (Grushvitsky,1961; Zhuravlev and Kolyada, 1996; Budantsev and Lesiovskaya,2001; Palagina et al., 2011; Palagina and Bogoutdinova, 2012).Birch (Betula pendula Roth., and B. pubescens Ehrh.) saphas been gathered all over Russia and was usually seen as arefreshing drink (Fedorov, 1984; Tcherepnin, 1987; Budantsevand Lesiovskaya, 2001). Today, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,Ukraine and Belarus are the only countries where the gatheringand use of birch sap has remained an important. Large birchforests, low population density and the incorporation of sapinto the former Soviet economic system facilitated this (Svanberget al., 2012). Birch sap was utilized the diverse ways as describedFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org November 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 841277Shikov et al. Food, Wild Plants, Russian Pharmacopoeiaby the Russian ethnographer Zelenin (1927). It was drunk fresh,but also fermented by adding malt, wax, beans or rye bread.Tea and Coffee SubstitutesAfter water, tea is the second most-consumed beverageworldwide (Keating et al., 2015). Although the English term "tea"generally denotes an infusion made of the leaves of Camelliasinensis (L.) Kuntze, many herbal teas, which usually are mono-or polyherbal formulations made from (medicinal) plant(s), areavailable worldwide. Historically in Russia such herbal teas oftenmade from local species were widespread. Samovar and tea-drinking are an indispensable element of Russian culture. WithC.
