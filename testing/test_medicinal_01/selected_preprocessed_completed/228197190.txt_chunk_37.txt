I will be exploring the use of traditional herbal remedies by South Asian diasporic communities in the UK. Nature has provided a pharmacy, which people have recognised and taken full advantage of. The knowledge of which plants are medicinally beneficial comes from the use of plants as food, trial and error, and now more commonly from scientific research. Many Western medicines available have been developed from natural sources; approximately 25% of medicines prescribed worldwide are derived from plants. The use of plants, herbs and spices to prevent and treat diseases goes back before written records were created and this continues to thrive today. As healthcare professionals we may be faced with many challenges; including the concurrent use of conventional western medicine and traditional herbal medicine. Is it safe or effective to consume herbs and spices for medicinal purposes? Have your say Here is the chance to share your views anonymously. Here is the opportunity to express your personal and professional opinions on traditional herbal medicines. Taking part The questionnaire is designed to explore UK based healthcare professionals' views and opinions on traditional herbal medicines. In order to participate all you have to do is answer a few questions, which will take no more than ten minutes. By completing the questionnaire you are consenting for the data to be analysed and published as part of my thesis, in academic journals and at conferences. Confidentiality All completed questionnaires will remain confidential as no unauthorised person will have access to the data. As no personal details are required the process ensures anonymity and there will be no way of identifying your responses. This study has been approved by the De Montfort University Ethics Committee and NHS Leicester City, Clinical Commissioning Group.

I am doing a PhD at De Montfort University in traditional Indian herbal medicine. I have a keen interest in tulsi, Holy basil, Ocimum tenuiflorum. Tulsi 'the queen of herbs' is one of India's most sacred herbs known for its divine healing properties. The tulsi plant holds a prestigious position in every Hindu household, as it represents the goddess Virinda Tulsi; a woman of immense purity and devotion to God. My aim is to explore the origins of tulsi, why people keep it in their homes, what they use it for and to collect a variety of samples for DNA analysis, to verify the genetics of the plant. I would also like to collect tulsi seeds to add to our current tulsi nursery. In order to participate in this research you must be over eighteen years old, you will need to answer some questions, which will take no more than fifteen minutes. By answering the questions you are consenting for the data to be analysed and published as part of my thesis. If you wish to withdraw from participation, you may choose to stop the interview at any point. If you have any tulsi products and are happy to give me a sample I only need a small amount. If you are happy to be contacted at a later date for further information please leave your name and contact details. All samples collected will be given a reference number so anonymity will be ensured throughout the process. All information disclosed will remain confidential as no unauthorised person will have access to the data.I hope you will enjoy this and thank you for participating in my research. .............................................................................................................. ........................................

Identification was based on a 100% match across the sequence length after the ends were trimmed to start and end at the same position (*some species identified according to the closest match on GenBank).
