OLD WORLD PLANTSOPIUM POPPY"Oh, jab me with your fine needle a hundred times,and a hundred times I will bless you, Saint Morphine. "[Jules Verne]"When I got home that night I experienced for thefirst time the white night of opium. One lies relaxedand wakeful, not desiring sleep. We dread wakefulnesswhen our thoughts are disturbed, but in this state oneis calm...." [Graham Greene]"... The next morning ... I awoke with excruciatingrheumatic pains of the head and face, from which Ihad hardly any respite for about twenty days. On thetwenty-first day I think it was ... that I went out intothe streets; rather to run away, if possible, from mytorments, than with any distinct purpose of relief. Byaccident, I met a college acquaintance, whorecommended opium. Opium! dread agent ofunimaginable pleasure and pain! ... After arriving atmy lodging (with my purchase of a copper halfpenceworth of opium), it may be supposed that I lost not amoment in taking the quantity prescribed. I wasnecessarily ignorant of the whole art and mystery ofopium-taking; and what I took I took under everydisadvantage. But I took it; and in an hour, Oheavens! what a revulsion! what a resurrection, fromits lowest depths, of the inner spirit! what anapocalypse of the world within me! That my pain hadvanished was now a trifle in my eyes; this positiveeffect was swallowed up in the immensity of thosepositive effects which had opened before me, in theabyss of divine enjoyment thus suddenly revealed.Here was a panacea, a pharmakon nepenthes, for allhuman woes; here was the secret of happiness, aboutwhich the philosophers had disputed for so manyages, at once discovered; happiness might now bebought for a penny, and carried in the waistcoat-pocket; portable ecstasies might be had corked up ina pint-bottle, and peace of mind could be sent downby mail...."

It is now widelycultivated and escaped. The opium poppy is closelyrelated to the ornamental garden poppies and to ourstate flower, the California-poppy. The history ofopium use is an ancient one. By the 16th century,opium was used in several standard medicaltreatments. The physician Paracelsus concoctedlaudanum, a mixture of opium and alcohol(technically referred to as tincture of opium). Englishliterature is filled with characters who used laudanumfor one thing or another. In 1732, Thomas Dover, anEnglish physician, invented a gout remedy, Dover'sPowder. In the 18th century a very popular homeremedy for diarrhea was paregoric, a mixture ofopium and camphor. It remains a popular treatmenttoday, although it must be purchased by prescriptionsince it contains a narcotic. By the end of the 19thcentury, opium-containing medicinals were socommonly used that it is estimated that 1/400Americans were addicted, many of them housewives.THE OPIUM WARS"... a war more unjust in its origin, a war morecalculated to cover this country with permanentdisgrace, I do not know and I have not read of. "(William Gladstone)' ' ' ' 'Opium has been involved in the statecraft of manygreat powers. In the 19th century, Great Britainwished to make trade agreements with the Chinese.The English were interested in buying tea from China,and would in turn sell the Chinese opium. TheEmperor of China objected strenuously and told hiscourt officials to have no dealings with theseforeigners. The British made "informal arrangements"with certain officials in Canton, and soon British andAmerican ships were taking opium into China andbringing out tea. Finally in 1838, the Emperor put anew official in charge of watching over the port atCanton. He immediately confiscated all of the opiumon British and American ships and seized thousands ofcases in warehouses on docks. The British wereinfuriated. The result was the "Opium War." Britain,the leading naval power of the world, soon defeatedthe Chinese. They forced a treaty opening China totrade, creating the British Crown Colony of HongKong, and made the Chinese pay about $6,000,000 indamages for destroying the opium. The Opium War isnot remembered today by many who associate theproblem of opium with China.In 1839, Lin Zexu, Chinese High Commissioner, wrotethe following letter to Queen Victoria. "The Way ofHeaven (Tao) is fairness to all. It does not suffer us toharm others in order to benefit ourselves. Men arealike in this all the world over; that they cherish lifeand hate what endangers life.
