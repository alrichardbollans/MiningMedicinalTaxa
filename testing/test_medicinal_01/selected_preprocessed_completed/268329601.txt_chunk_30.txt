FORAGE PLANTSI will close this section on food plants by pointing outto you that there is another vastly important categoryof food plants -- those that we feed to ourdomesticated animals, especially horses, dairy cattleand beef cattle. Another way of looking at it is that weuse dairy and beef cattle to transform plants intomeat, milk, and other dairy products. In the UnitedStates alone, forage crops constitute a multibilliondollar industry. It is estimated that more than half ofthe earth's land surface is devoted to pastures andmeadows used for grazing by farm animals.The high cellulose levels of grass stems and leavesmake these tissues relatively difficult for mostanimals, including humans, to digest. However, thebacteria that inhabit the intestinal tracts of manyanimals carry out a fermentation process that reducesthe cellulose to simpler compounds. We also create asuitable environ-ment in which anaerobic fermentationcan occur when we put silage into a silo -- thosecylindrical, observatory-looking structures that yousee in farm country. For all practical purposes,chopped up plant material is pickled by being bathedin organic acids that are produced by the bacteria. Ifdone properly, silage can be stored for years. The endproduct may sound pretty disgusting, but many of usenjoy something that is similarly prepared. It is calledsauerkraut. From the German (sour + cabbage), it ischopped cabbage leaves that have been fermented inbrine.Although a great variety of plants can providepalatable food for our domesticated animals, all of theimportant forage plants are either grasses or legumes.COMMON FORAGE PLANTSCommon Name Scientific Name CommentGRASSES:Bermuda grass Cynodon dactylon Also an aggressive weed and lawn grassBrome grasses Bromus spp. Very important in dry, cool regionsBuffalo grass Buchloe dactyloides Native grass of cool, dry prairiesFescues Festuca spp. Well adapted to warm summersKentucky bluegrass Poa pratensis One of the best and most palatableLove grasses Eragrostis spp. Widely used in southern Great PlainsOrchard grass Dactylis glomerata Does well in cool, humid regionsRedtop Agrostis stolonifera One of the best wetland forage grassesReed canary grass Phalaris arundinacea Well adapted to wet areasSorghum Sorghum bicolor Also used for grain, silage, and syrupTimothy Phleum pratense Eurasian; widely plantedWheat grasses Agropyron spp. Good in cool, dry regionsWild ryes Elymus spp. Natives of the Pacific Northwest-104-LEGUMES:Alfalfa Medicago sativa Excellent protein sourceBird's-foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus Grows well on poor soilsBush clovers Lespedeza spp. Plants of poor soilsClovers Trifolium spp. Good protein and very palatableCrown vetch Coronilla varia Eurasian; also used for erosion controlSweet clovers Melilotus spp. Drought resistant; good soil buildersVetches Vicia spp. Often used as winter cover crops-105-SECTION 6 ! SPICES, FLAVORINGS, AND SUGAR6.1 - AN OVERVIEW' Most of the spices and flavorings that we usetoday were also used in ancient times.' It is difficult for us now to imagine how preciouscertain spices were in the Middle Ages and theefforts made then to discover where they grewand to control their sale.' Many of them are associated with particularregions of the world and ethnic groups.' Some spices are made by grinding up entireplants, but most of them come from a particularpart, such bark, leaves, seeds, etc.' Spices have little food value.' Some spices and flavorings, such as horseradishand wasabi, can be toxic if consumed in excess.' In addition to their use in the kitchen, spices alsoare used in various medicines to impart apleasant flavor.' Before the invention of refrigeration, spices wereused to mask the unpleasantness of spoilingmeat.' Sugars are carbohydrates, with the ratio ofhydrogen to oxygen being 2:1, as in water.'
