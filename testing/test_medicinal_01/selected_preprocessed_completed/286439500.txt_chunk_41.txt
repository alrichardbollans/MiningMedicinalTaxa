Moreover, inSupplementary Table 1, we reported some of the most importantbibliographic references for plant species and ailments treatedthat were not mentioned by the informants (Snogerup andSnogerup, 1987, 1993; Panitsa et al., 1994, 2006, 2010; Snogerupet al., 2001; Bergmeier et al., 2003; Bazos, 2005; Bourbonnais-Spear et al., 2006; Saliaris, 2008; Axiotis and Axiotis, 2012; Strid,2016).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn the context of the current survey numerous medicinal plantswere ethnopharmacologicaly investigated (in SupplementaryTable 1). The interviews indicated that 109 wild plant speciesfrom 52 different families are being used for medicinal purposes.Lamiaceae family is represented by the highest number of species(17), such as the endemic and endangered Sideritis sipylea Boiss.Asteraceae family is represented by 12 species. Brassicaceae andRosaceae by 5 species. The rest of the plant families are shownin Supplementary Figure 2. Most of the plant parts were used totreat different diseases and they were mostly stored in glass bottlesas homemade dry powders obtained by crushing down well-driedplant materials; the most frequently used parts are leaves (22,8%),roots (12,78%), flowers (11,41%), essential oils (7,30%), fruits(6,84%), and barks (5%). The most common preparation is thedecoction.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 409100fphar-09-00409 May 19, 2018 Time: 14:41 # 3Axiotis et al. Ethnobotanical Study of North AegeanFIGURE 1 | Geographical location of the study area (Islands in red). Collection sites of the information are as follows. (1) Lemnos, (2) Agios Efstratios, (3) Lesvos,(4) Chios, (5) Psara, (6) Oinousses, (7) Samos, (8) Ikaria, (9) Fourni (http://www.pvaigaiou.gov.gr).Interestingly, Hypericum perforatum L. and Verbascumikaricum Murb. are kept in olive oil and used as solutions forwounds and sun burns. Pharmacists from Lesvos, Chios andSamos, still use these preparations as traditional therapy forskin wound healing in combination with modern treatments.Furthermore, clinicians from Lesvos use the powder of theroot of Alkanna tinctoria for skin regeneration after injuries.They observed a combined antibacterial and antipruritic action,which reduces the healing time of the wound. It is important tonote that Sideritis sipylea Boiss., Origanum sipyleum L., Thymussipyleus Boiss., which are endemic and endangered plants aremostly used by the local people of Lesvos, Chios, and Ikariawith many curative purposes, especially for the infections of therespiratory and gastrointestinal tract as indicated from the UVvalues (Supplementary Table 1).Furthermore, the resin of Pistacia lentiscus L., unique productglobally of the Chios island is widely used against diarrhea, asexpectorant and for ulcer healing. The use of the water extractof the roots of Anthyllis hermanniae L. as an efficient naturalremedy against kidney stones in Lesvos and Lemnos, is reportedhere for the first time. It was also observed that local people,especially farmers, use the same name for different plant species.For example, Cistus creticus L. and Cistus salvifolius L. are bothcalled "Aksistaros"; Origanum vulgare L. and the endemic andendangered Origanum sipyleum L. are both called "Rigani." Thislack of distinction by the local population exacerbates the risksfor the endangered species.Very interesting is the distribution of ailments treatedversus plant species used. As it is presented in Figure 2,locals are choosing herbal remedies mainly for antimicrobialactivity, gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory, inflammatory,cardiovascular diseases, and skin burns. In SupplementaryTable 3, FIC values of categories of ailments are summarized.Hormonal diseases have the highest FIC value (0,722), while thelowest belongs to the cardiovascular diseases (0,161). Moreover,among the species recorded (Supplementary Table 1), the highestUV were calculated for Matricaria chamomilla L. (0.75) andLavandula stoechas L. (0.64). From the endemic species thehighest UV is recorded for Sideritis sipylea Boiss. (0.31).Essential oils are also common in the region, mainly derivedfrom aromatic plants of Lamiaceae family and they are producedby water or steam distillation. The oils are usually used as dropsdirectly on the skin or in galenic formulations, for skin infectionsor burns. In some cases, they are used for stomach pain (Anthemissp.) or even for urinary infections (Sideritis sipylea Boiss.). Themost common plants used for producing essential oils are SalviaFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org May 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 409101fphar-09-00409 May 19, 2018 Time: 14:41 # 4Axiotis et al.

Furthermore, it has beenreported a traditional method for the production of rose oil of theflower petals of Rosa damascena Mill. in a small village of Lesvos.The oil is used for external burns or skin inflammations.The pharmacological properties of medicinal plants presentedin the current study has been also verified by published data, inseveral cases. For example, the essential oil of Laurus nobilis L.,used as anti-inflammatory is reported by Sayyah et al. (2003).The expectorant effect of Cistus creticus L. and the use of Menthaspicata L. in cases of common cold have been reported by Fakiret al. (2009). Tonic effects of Rosmarinus officinalis L. and thediuretic effects of Raphanus raphanistrum L. have been reportedby Bruni et al. (1997). The essential oil of Sideritis species presentsan important antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity and ithas been previously reported by Aligiannis et al. (2001).Generally, these plants are distributed mainly in Lesvos, Chios,Samos, and Ikaria and the majority are wild. A serious threat forsome of these plants, is that they are collected in large amountsfor the local markets; some of them, such as Sideritis sipyleaBoiss., Origanum sipyleum L., Thymus sipyleus Boiss., are in factlisted in the book of the Red List of Threatened Species. Manyspecies, such as Origanum vulgare L. and Paeonia mascula (L.)Mill. subsp. mascula are not yet listed but their population is in acritical condition. Endemic medicinal plants of the research areaare also annotated in Supplementary Table 2.A very important issue is the increased use of medicinalplants in these islands which has led to heavy pressure on thenative populations of many species. The local population mustacknowledge their endangerment and should cultivate them,in order to protect their populations from extinction. Sideritissipylea Boiss. is one of the over harvested species. Habitat loss anddeforestation in Lesvos, Chios, and Samos resulted in a generaldegradation of the ecosystems that could lead to the extinction ofmany species.In conclusion, from this brief report is clear that medicinalplants are an important element of indigenous medical systemof Northeast Aegean islands. In spite of the fact that thelocal population has access to modern medicines, many peoplecontinue to depend, at least for the treatment of some diseases,on herbal remedies. These therapies represent for many localdoctors a low-cost alternative. The population of many endemicspecies such as Sideritis sipylea Boiss., Origanum sipyleum L., arein a critical condition due to unsustainable harvesting techniques,habitat destruction, and absence of cultivation. The endemicspecies of the area have medicinal properties dependent on themetabolites which respond to environmental stimuli that maybe absent under culture conditions. Because of this it is veryimportant to educate local people about respecting their naturalhabitats and strengthen the legislation against the illegal trade ofendemic and endangered plants in the local and national market.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSEA contributed to the study conception and design of themethodology.
