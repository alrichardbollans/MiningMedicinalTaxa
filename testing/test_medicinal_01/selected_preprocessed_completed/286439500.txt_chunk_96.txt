The present study aimed toevaluate the chemical composition (polyphenols, iridoids, and phytosterols), antioxidant,antimicrobial and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of different extracts of A. laxmanniiaerial parts. The major identified bioactive compounds were rutin, 8-O-acetylharpagideand b-sitosterol. The antioxidant activity of A. laxmannii extracts was evaluated usingseveral methods, and the results showed good antiradical effects. Moreover, theantimicrobial evaluation showed a potent antifungal activity against C. albicans andP. funiculosum. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory effect was determined by monitoringsome parameters involved in the inflammatory process. The results obtained showeddifferences between the analyzed extracts; and therefore the importance of choosingthe best solvent in order to extract the appropriate amount of bioactive compounds.A. laxmannii ethanol extract showed an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing totalleukocytes, PMN, phagocytosis, and oxidative stress. Compared to diclofenac, only the50 mg/mL A. laxmannii extract had better anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stresseffects, and this could justify the importance of a correlation between the activity andthe used concentration. These findings strongly suggest that A. laxmannii could beconsidered as a valuable source of bioactive compounds, which could be further valuedas anti-inflammatory agents in the composition of several herbal drugs.Keywords: Ajuga laxmannii, polyphenols, iridoids, sterols, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobialFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7252fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 2Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiINTRODUCTIONMedicinal plants have proven their value as sources of moleculeswith therapeutic potential, and still represent an importantpool for the identification of novel drug leads (Atanasov et al.,2015). Moreover, nowadays herbal medicines have receivedgreat scientific interest because they provide both importantbiomolecules which are used in the treatment of severaldiseases, as well as a broad spectrum of long-term use andsafety. Nevertheless, plant secondary metabolites are excellentcandidates for developing new phytopharmaceuticals withvarious biological activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial,and anti-inflammatory (Shahidi and Ambigaipalan, 2015; Liaoet al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017).In many parts of the world such as Europe, Asia, Africa,South America, plants and/or plant compounds are used tocure or prevent different diseases, being in the same time partof the cultural inheritage of different nations or ethnicities.Still, herbal medicines were used and applied only based ontraditional knowledge and empirical observations of "indigenoushealers," without elucidating the chemical composition of theused extracts or mechanistic knowledge of their pharmacologicalactivities and main bioactive compounds (Atanasov et al.,2015). Often, the empirical value of medicinal plants is seenas a proof of effectiveness and safety, and still many plantpreparations are traditionally used without having a certainscientific proof of their pharmacological effects or long-termsafety and efficacy.Phytochemicals are biomolecules that occur in herbal drugsor phytopharmaceuticals, and possess the ability to modulate oneor more metabolic processes or pathways in the human organismresulting in health benefits and promotion of well-being (Abuajahet al., 2014; Ferrante et al., 2017; Locatelli et al., 2017). Within thisframe, new studies on uninvestigated traditionally used medicinalplants or plant products provide remarkable interest for thedevelopment of novel herbal drugs or herbal formulations.The genus Ajuga part of the Lamiaceae family comprises 50species, and about 300 taxa (including subspecies and varieties),distributed in Asia, Africa, Australia, North America, and Europe(Riaz et al., 2007; Atay et al., 2016). Some Ajuga species are usedin folk medicine for the treatment of diabetes, inflammation,malaria, high blood pressure, pain, fever, and as antihelmintic(Cocquyt et al., 2011). Moreover, several studies have been carriedout on Ajuga species indicating pharmacological activities such asantimalarial (Njoroge and Bussmann, 2006; Cocquyt et al., 2011),hypoglycemic (El-Hilaly et al., 2006), anti-inflammatory (Gautamet al., 2011), anti-arthritis, antipyretic, anabolic, antibacterial,hepatoprotective, antifungal, antioxidant, cardiotonic (Israili andLyoussi, 2009), and analgesic properties (Ono et al., 2008).Additionally, several phytochemical studies on Ajuga specieshave shown the presence of iridoids, diterpenes, phytoecdy-steroids, flavonoids, sterol glycosides and phenylethanoidglycosides as the main secondary metabolites of the genus(Manguro et al., 2006, 2011; Ono et al., 2011; Atay et al., 2016).Ajuga laxmannii (Murray) Benth. is an erect rhizomatouspubescent herb that belongs to the genus Ajuga, growing in thegrasslands of Romania and other parts of Europe. In Romania,the local name for this species is "nobleman's beard" (Romanian -"barba boierului" or "avraVmeascaV" or "cres,tineascaV"), and it isused as a galactogogue and anti-inflammatory agent. To thebest of our knowledge, there is only one study on A. laxmannii(Murray) Benth. regarding its antiprotozoal activity (Atay et al.,2016).Within this frame, the aim of this study was to performa phytochemical analysis of A. laxmannii aerial parts extracts,particularly polyphenolic compounds, iridoids and phytosterols,and to investigate the antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicalsThe standards used were chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid,caffeic acid, rutin, apigenin, quercetin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside,kaempferol, quercetol, myricetol, fisetin, gallic acid, aucubin,catalpol, harpagoside, b-sitosterol, brassicasterol, stigmasterol,campesterol and ergosterol from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany),ferulic acid, sinapic acid, gentisic acid, patuletin, luteolin fromRoth (Germany), caftaric acid from Dalton (United States),harpagide, 8-O-acetyl-harpagide from PhytoLab GmbH & Co.(Germany).

Sodium carbonate, Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, sodium acetate trihydrate andanhydrous aluminum chloride were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). The DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl),Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylicacid) were obtained from Alfa-Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany),HRP (horseradish peroxidase), Fremy's salt were purchased fromSigma-Aldrich (Germany).Methanolic stock solutions (100 mg/mL) of the flavonoidstandards were prepared and stored at 4*C, protected fromdaylight. They were appropriately diluted with double distilledwater before being used as working solutions. Methanolic stocksolutions of iridoids (1 mg/mL) were prepared and stored at 4*C,protected from daylight. They were appropriately diluted withdouble distilled water before being used as working solutions.Chloroform stock solutions (1 mg/mL) of the phytosterolstandards were prepared and stored at 4*C, protected fromdaylight. Before being used as working solutions, they wereappropriately diluted with acetonitrile. Distilled, deionised waterwas produced by a Direct Q-5 Millipore (Millipore SA, Molsheim,France) water system.Plant Sample and Extraction ProcedureAjuga laxmannii aerial parts were collected from Cluj County(Romania) spontaneous flora during flowering stage in June2015. The air-dried powder of herbal material was extracted withdifferent solvents. The methanol extract was obtained from 5 gFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 7253fphar-09-00007 February 28, 2018 Time: 16:16 # 3Toiu et al. Bioactivities and Chemical Composition of Ajuga laxmanniiherbal material and 50 mL 70% methanol for 30 min on a waterbath at 60*C (Methanol Extract, ME). The 10% tincture wasprepared at room temperature from 100 g of herbal materialand 1000 mL 70% ethanol by maceration at room temperaturefor 7 days (Ethanol Extract, EE) as previously described byToiu et al. (2017). In order to evaluate the anti-inflammatoryactivity of A. laxmannii aerial parts, three extracts were used:A. laxmannii ethanol extract 100% (100 mg dry weight herbalmaterial/mL), A. laxmannii ethanol extract 50% (50 mg dw herbalmaterial/mL), and A. laxmannii ethanol extract 25% (25 mg dwherbal material/mL).For identification and quantification of phytosterols, and fordetermination of antifungal properties, chloroform (CE) andpetroleum ether extracts (PEE) were also prepared. Thus, 2.5 g ofherbal material were extracted with 25 mL chloroform and 25 mLpetroleum ether, respectively, for 30 min in a sonication bath at60*C. The extracts were cooled down, and then centrifuged at4500 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was recovered (Mocanet al., 2014).Quantitative Determinations of TotalBioactive CompoundsTotal Phenolic Content (TPC)The total phenolic content (TPC) of the A. laxmannii extractswas determined photometrically, by Folin-Ciocalteu method withslight modifications (TaVmas, et al., 2009). Briefly, 2 mL of eachethanolic and methanolic extracts were diluted 25 times, thenmixed with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (1 mL) and distilled water(10.0 mL), and further diluted to 25 mL with a 290 g/L solutionof sodium carbonate. The samples were incubated in the darkfor 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 760 nm, usinga JASCO V-530 (Jasco International Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)UV-VIS spectrophotometer. TPC values were expressed as gallicacid equivalents (R2 = 0.999), mg gallic acid/g dry weight herbalmaterial (mg GAE/g dw herbal material). Assay was performedin triplicate.Total Flavonoid Content (TFC)The total flavonoid content (TFC) of the A. laxmannii extractswas calculated and expressed as rutin equivalents after themethod previously described (Mocan et al., 2014). Briefly, eachextract (EE and ME) (5 mL) was mixed with sodium acetate(5.0 mL, 100 g/L), aluminum chloride (3.0 mL, 25 g/L), andmixed up to 25 mL in a calibrated flask with methanol. Theabsorbance was measured at 430 nm. The TFC was expressedas rutin equivalents (R2 = 0.999), mg rutin equivalents/g dryweight herbal material (mg RE/g dw herbal material). Assay wasperformed in triplicate.Total Iridoid Content (TIC)The total iridoid content (TIC) of the A. laxmannii extractswas determined by a photometric method based on a Trim-Hillreaction and the results were expressed as aucubin equivalents(mg AE/g dw herbal material). Each extract (0.4 mL) wasmixed with 4 mL of Trim-Hill reagent (acetic acid -0.2%CuSO4 - conc. HCl, 10:1:0.5), afterwards the absorbance wasmeasured at 609 nm, and the blue color indicated the presence ofiridoids. The amount of iridoids was calculated using an aucubin(0.1-1 mg/mL) calibration curve (R2 = 0.999) (Erdenechimeget al., 2017). Assay was performed in triplicate.Antioxidant Capacity AssaysFor testing the antioxidant capacity, the A. laxmannii extractswere further tested using three different assays.DPPH Radical Scavenging ActivityThe effect of the A. laxmannii extracts against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was tested accordingto Savran et al. (2016). Two milliliters of sample solution(2 mL, 3.75-30 ug/mL) was added to 2 mL of a 0.1 mg/mLDPPH methanol solution. After 30 min of incubation at roomtemperature in the dark, the absorbance was read at 517 nm.The DPPH radical scavenging activity was expressed as IC50(ug/mL). The percentage of DPPH consumption was convertedto trolox equivalents (TE) using a calibration curve (R2 = 0.985)of Trolox standard solutions (0.5-5 ug/mL). Considering theresults, an IC50 < 50 ug TE/mL shows a very good antioxidantpotential; an IC50 of 50-100 ug TE/mL displays a goodantioxidant potential; an IC50 of 100-200 ug TE/mL reveals aweak antioxidant potential; an IC50 > 200 ug TE/mL means noantioxidant potential (Araniciu et al., 2014).
