Together, these data clearly suggested that fruitpulp extracts (PEE and PAE) obliterate the stemness property ofbreast cancer cells.DISCUSSIONConsidering the current status of diagnostic and treatmentoptions available, cancer associated deaths are on the rise.In India, carcinoma of the breast and cervix contributes toFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593303fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 8Chowdhury et al.

However, surgical removal,radiation-, chemo-, endocrine-, and other targeted- therapiesare continuously being improvised to improve the overallsurvival and quality of life of cancer patients. Althoughmodern treatment modalities are capable of taking care ofthe primary tumors, tumor recurrence and metastasis are themajor limitations in the limelight at present. Furthermore,2breastcancerindia.netchemotherapeutic drugs often show significant off-target effectsalong with systemic toxicity, such as cardiovascular, liver andnephrotoxicity (King and Perry, 2001; Schimmel et al., 2004).Thus, finding novel anticancer drugs, which prevent both tumorgrowth and metastasis while circumventing the known sideeffects, is an active area of research. In this area, applicationof natural products like secondary metabolites with effectivetumor suppressive ability has shown promise in recent yearsas they are found to be effective even at sufficiently lowerFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org September 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 593304fphar-08-00593 September 1, 2017 Time: 16:33 # 9Chowdhury et al.

Reportsabout the nutritional and medicinal values of this plant andpresence of many bioactive molecules had initially attracted ourattention (Sawaya et al., 1983, 1986; Asyaz et al., 2010; Marzouket al., 2010; Hussain et al., 2013, 2014; Jeon and Lee, 2014;Chawech et al., 2017). Moreover, Tannin-Spitz et al. (2007)found that an isolate (cucurbitacin glucosides) extracted fromthe leaves of this plant exhibits apoptotic activity in cancer cells.Nevertheless, no detailed study was done regarding the anti-cancer effects of this plant extract. Our study found that bothethanol and acetone extracts of fruit pulp of the colocynth plantshowed a significant inhibition of cell viability of various cancercell lines, including breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231,and cervical cancer SiHa cell lines (Figures 1, 2 and Table 1).Correspondingly, both extracts had reverse cytotoxic effect onmononuclear cells PBMC and macrophage cell line J774A. Breastcancer MCF-7 cells showed more sensitivity to both ethanoland acetone pulp extracts as compared to other cancer cells.This was in agreement with previous reports that too claimhigher sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to colocynth fruit extract atrelatively lower concentrations (Mukherjee and Patil, 2012). Theprobable explanation may be either use of alkaloid rich extractsor longer exposure in MCF-7 cells (Mukherjee and Patil, 2012).Our study also found that both ethanol and acetone extractsexhibited synergistic potential with the chemotherapeutic drugdoxorubicin to inhibit viability in the breast cancer cells(Supplementary Figure S4).Moreover, on molecular analysis, we found suppression oftranscripts of anti-apoptotic genes BCL2 and BCLXL, and aninduction of apoptotic gene BAX and caspase 3 mRNA inmetastatic breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells following treatmentwith ethanol and acetone pulp extracts (Figure 3). In addition,these pulp extracts displayed a higher level of cleaved caspase3 protein and a lower level of BCL-2 protein as compared tocontrol, implying an enhancement of active caspase 3 upontreatment with these extracts (Figure 3). Thus, this studyindicated that colocynth fruit pulp extracts exhibit an anticancerpotential presumably by promoting apoptosis.As stated earlier, metastasis remains one of the major threatsto cancer patients. However, no study has yet been conductedto investigate the anti-metastatic potential of this plant extract.Our study indicated, for the first time, a preventive role ofthese pulp extracts in cancer cell migration, a key step in themetastatic process (Figures 4, 5) (Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011).These pulp extracts also block EMT (Chaffer and Weinberg,2011), another vital step in the metastatic cascade, since bothPEE and PAE treatment significantly enhanced epithelial geneexpression with simultaneous inhibition of mesenchymal markerexpression in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 6).Additionally, treatment of cancer cells with these ethanol andacetone pulp extracts showed a noticeable reduction in colonyand sphere formation with concomitant inhibition of cancerstemness associated genes CD44 and BMI-1 at their transcriptlevels, suggesting a preventive role of these pulp extractsin cancer stemness (Monteiro and Fodde, 2010), a pivotalproperty responsible for metastasis, therapy resistance and tumorrecurrence (Figures 7, 8).All these findings summarized a role of the ethanol andacetone fruit pulp extracts of colocynth in prevention of cellproliferation, induction of cell apoptosis, prevention of cellmigration, reduction of EMT, and inhibition of cancer stemnessproperty in breast cancer cells.However, further study is required to identify the bioactivemolecule(s) present in fruit pulp, liable for the observedanticancer potential.
