majus was furtherinvestigated against a broader panel of Candida, includingfluconazole resistant strains, and other fungi (Table 3 andSupplementary Table S3). In addition to crude methanolicextract, infusion and hydroalcoholic extracts have been tested.Notably, all H. hircinum subsp. majus extracts showed antifungalproperties and, in particular a remarkable activity againstfluconazole resistant C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis strains.The methanolic extract showed the most pronounced cytotoxicproperties. Yet, in general the antifungal activity of the infusionoutcompeted those of the hydroalcoholic extract, also withrespect to the MIC90 values.Cytotoxicity of H. hircinum subsp. majusExtractsThe cytototoxicity ofH. hircinum subsp.majus extracts was testedon PBMC and human skin fibroblast Hs27 cell lines by usingthe WST-8 conversion assay. The extracts were tested at a doseof 500 ug/ml, which corresponds to a 1- (for C. tropicalis) to10-fold higher concentration than those showing inhibition of50% of Candida growth. As shown in Figure 1, only the plantinfusion showed no cytotoxic effect on both human cell lines,while treatment with methanolic and hydroalcoholic extractsinhibited cell viability by 50% for Hs27 cell line and by 65-70%for PBMCs.The effect of H. hircinum subsp. majus on human cells was alsoobserved microscopically (Figure 2). The imagines confirmed thecytotoxicity data. Fibroblast treated with plant infusion showeda normal phenotype, while under treatment with methanolicand hydro-alcoholic extracts the cell morphology was markedlyaltered. The same alteration was observed for PBMCs (data notshown).Chemical Composition of H. hircinumsusbps. majus InfusionThe chemical composition of the aqueous extract of H. hircinumsubsp. majus is reported in Table 4. The analysis revealed thatthe infusion process allowed the extraction of higher amountsof phenols in comparison to the extraction by macerationin methanol. The aqueous extract was mainly characterizedby derivatives of quercetin (24,18 mg/g), of chlorogenic acid(4,51 mg/g) and by flavan-3-ols (2,26 mg/g). Hyperoside wasthe most abundant compound, representing the 2,23% of theextract. Abundant were also quercetin-3-glucoside (1,65 mg/g),neochlorogenic acid (2,61 mg/g), chlorogenic acid (1,68 mg/g),procyanidin B2 (0,89 mg/g), epicatechin (0,59 mg/g) andprocyanidin B1(0,40 mg/g).DISCUSSIONPlant-based treatments of the traditional medicine could bringforth new solutions for antifungal therapies. In particularpolyphenol-rich plants represent an import source of bioactiveproducts for human health (Marchelak et al., 2017) includingantifungal treatments. Among polyphenols, flavan-3-ols,flavonols and tannins show a high antimicrobial potential(Daglia, 2012). Flavan-3-ols isolated from green and black teaexert important anti-Candida activity (Hirasawa and Takada,2004; Sitheeque et al., 2009), ellagitannins obtained from Punicagranatum inhibit the growth of plant pathogenic fungi (Glazeret al., 2012), the flavonols myricitrin and fisetin are consideredeffective agents against Candida glabrata and Cryptococcusneoformans, respectively (Salazar-Aranda et al., 2015; Reis et al.,2016). The mechanisms of action of phenols against Candidahave been intensively studied and include inactivation ofenzyme production (Evensen and Braun, 2009) and anti-biofilmeffects (Evensen and Braun, 2009; Shahzad et al., 2014).

Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal Extractsbelonging to the Hypericum genus are able to synthesize a broadarray of such bioactive phenolic compounds, mainly as productsof the polyketide metabolism (Tocci et al., 2018b), and thereforemight contain novel antifungal remedies.Here we report new data on the inhibitory activity of extractsderiving from H. montanum, H. maculatum, H. hirsutum,and H. hircinum subsp. majus and additional data on theactivity of H. perforatum on the growth of clinical isolates ofCandida spp. The crude extracts obtained from H. maculatum,H. montanum, H. hirsutum, and H. perforatum showed amoderate antifungal activity against C. albicans, in the rangeof 250-500 ug/ml, good activity against C. lusitaniae (64-125 ug/ml) and no or only weak activity against C. parapsilosis,C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. Our data are in accordancewith those of Radulovic' et al., 2007, showing that extractsof H. hirsutum, H. maculatum, and H. perforatum exertedcomparable antifungal activity against C. albicans using thedisk diffusion method assay. Discordant data are reportedin Cecchini et al., 2007 which found no activity of extractsobtained from H. hirsutum or H. montanum against C. albicans.Most interesting, the antifungal screening of crude extractsunveiled the promising anti-Candida properties of H. hircinumsubsp. majus. The test showed that extracts obtained fromthis species are able to inhibit 50% of growth of C. albicansat concentrations that are fourfold to eightfold lower thanother Hypericum extracts and with a more pronounced activityagainst C. parapsilosis and C. lusitaniae. Moreover H. hircinummethanolic extract was the only treatment able to inhibit thegrowth of C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. These results areimportant especially in the light of the increasing incidenceof infections caused by emerging Candida pathogens likeC. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei, whichare less susceptible to the commonly used antifungal drugs(Tortorano et al., 2006; Papon et al., 2013). Previous data onthe antifungal activity of H. hircinum are scarce and limitedto susceptibility tests against just a single reference strainof C. albicans. Using the disk diffusion test method Pistelliet al., 2000 found no antifungal activity against the testedstrain, while Cecchini et al., 2007 reported a higher activity ofH. hircinum subsp. majus in comparison to other Hypericumspecies.From a chemical point of view, the extracts applied astreatments in our tests have been deeply characterized byinvestigating the presence of 52 phenolic compounds. Ingeneral, the most abundant classes of detected compoundswere flavonols, benzoate and cinnamates (chlorogenic acidand neochlorogenic acid), and flavan-3-ols. The majormetabolite in all the extracts was the flavonol hyperoside,ranging from 4940 +- 66,3 ug/g in H. montanum to9306 +- 385 ug/g in H. hircinum subsp. majus, and veryabundant were the neochlorogenic acid and the flavan-3-olepicatechin. Hyperoside is known for its anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties (Ogawa et al.,2014). The extract of H. hircinum subsp. majus, showedseveral chemical peculiarities. It contained the highestamount of hyperoside, higher amounts of chlorogenicacid, quercetin-3-glucuronide, kampferol-3-glucuronide,catechin, epigallogatechin, gallocatechin, and no traces ofthe phloroglucinol hyperforin and of the naphtodianthronehypericin.In the light of its pronounced growth inhibition propertiesagainst Candida spp. and considering the ethnobotanicalknowledge available for this species, H. hircinum subsp. majushas been further subjected to a deeper antifungal screen.TABLE 4 | Analysis of phenolic compounds in the infusion of H. hircinum subsp. majus.Compound Amount (ug/g extract) Compound Amount (ug/g extract)2,6-di-OH-benzoic acid nd** Kaempferol 1,08 +- 0,153,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid 7,08 +- 0,79 Kaempferol -3-glucoside 7,89 +- 1,09Caffeic acid 44,62 +- 4,97 Kaempferol-3-glucuronide 104,41 +- 14,49Coniferyl alcohol nd* Iso-rhamnetin 0,78 +- 0,11Gallic acid 15,74 +- 2,18 Iso-rhamnetine-3-glucoside nd*Cinnamic acid 6,10 +- 0,85 Syringetin-3-glucoside 3,39 +- 0,46p-coumaric acid nd* Myricetin 7,68 +- 1,07p-OH-benzoic acid 8,97 +- 1,24 Luteolin 3,51 +- 0,22Vanillic acid 1,29 +- 0,18 Luteolin 7-O-glucoside 1,77 +- 0,24Cryptochlorogenic acid 229,7 +- 31,88 Naringenin nd*Chlorogenic acid 1683 +- 233,7 Esculin 21,28 +- 2,95Neochlorogenic acid 2615 +- 362,9 Phlorizin 6,57 +- 0,91Hyperoside 22203 +- 380 Catechin 282,2 +- 2,71Quercetin 164,38 +- 15,52 Epicatechin 586,51 +- 68,05Quercetin-3-arabinoside nd* Epigallocatechin 55,77 +- 7,74Quercetin-3-glucoside 1647 +- 65,03 Gallocatechin 48,92 +- 9,72Quercetin-3-glucuronide 104,41 +- 14,92 Procyanidin B1 401,6 +- 55,74Quercetin-3-sulfate nd* Procyanidin B2 886,16 +- 108,77Rutin nd* cis-piceid 1,37 +- 0,19Data are means of three independent experiments, *nd, not detected.Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 382145fphar-09-00382 April 20, 2018 Time: 12:10 # 8Tocci et al. Antimycotic Hypericum Herbal ExtractsH. hircinum is a shrub native to the areas of the MediterraneanBasin comprising Greece and Turkey (Euro+Med, 2006).The infusion of its aerial part is applied in the traditionalmedicine to treat chronic catarrhal affections, asthma, sorethroats and cough (Pieroni et al., 2004). Recent scientificevidences indicate that fungi of the phyla Basidiomycetesand Ascomycetes (e.g., Bjerkandera, Aspergillus, Candida, andSaccharomyces) are causative agents of these pathologies (Razaet al., 2017).To investigate whether the beneficial effect of H. hircinumtreatments may be attributed to its antifungal activity, we studied,for the first time, the activity of extracts obtained from theaerial parts of the plant with a hydroalcoholic solution and,in accordance with the traditional preparations, by infusionin boiling water. Additionally, we characterized the chemicalprofile. The assay was performed on a broad panel of clinicalCandida strains, a strain of Aspergillus glaucus and a strainof Penicillium paneum (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S3).The extract obtained from the herbal tea inhibited 50% ofthe growth of all tested fungi, showing strong activity againstboth fluconazole sensitive and resistant Candida strains andmoderate activity against Aspergillus and Penicillium strains.The chemical profile revealed an enrichment in the polyphenolcontent in comparison with the crude methanolic extract.Particularly abundant (content higher than 40 ug/g extract) werecaffeic acid, chlorogenic, neochlorogenic and cryptochlorogenicacid, quercetin, quercetin-3-glucoside, quercetin-3-glucuronide,kaempferol-3-glucuronide, all the flavan-3-ols investigated andextraordinary high levels of hyperoside were detected. Evenif the bioactivity may be due to the synergistic action ofthe phytocomplex, it appears reasonable to exclude caffeicacid, chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3-glucuronide, kaempferol-3-glucuronide, and gallocatechin as secondary metabolites towhich the antifungal activity may be attributed, since thesecompounds are not present in the other Hypericum extractsshowing growth inhibitory properties on Candida strains.Also, cryptochlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid quercetin,quercetin-3-glucoside, epicatechin, have been detected in allthe crude extract, but they were less present in H. hircinumsubsp. majus and thus their presence cannot be consideredcorrelated to the bioactivity. According to our data a positivecorrelation between the amount of catechin, epigallocatechin,procyanidin B1 and hyperoside and the antifungal activity exertedcan be individuated. The anti-Candida properties of flavan-3-ols, and in particular of catechin and epigallocatechin, are wellknown and documented (Hirasawa and Takada, 2004; Saitoet al., 2013). Nevertheless, our data suggest that the hyperoside,being detected in such high amounts in the extract obtained bythe infusion of H. hircinum subsp. majus in water, may playa fundamental role in the observed fungal growth inhibitionproperties. The hypothesis is supported by studies proposinghyperoside as a lead for the development of new fungicides (Liet al., 2005).Finally, the aqueous extract of H. hircinum subsp. majusshowed another promising characteristic exploitable for thedevelopment of a new antifungal therapy. When tested at highconcentrations on human PBMCs and human skin fibroblastHs27cell lines, no cytotoxicity was detected.CONCLUSIONOur work reports a comprehensive phenolic profile of fiveEuropean Hypericum species, highlighting the presence ofimportant exploitable bioactive metabolites. The infusion ofH. hircinum subsp. majus used in the popular medicine for thetreatment of respiratory tract affections has been chemically andbiologically investigated for the first time. The chemical analysisunveiled a new source of the bioactive metabolite hyperosidethat might be involved in the observed bioactivity of the extract.The biological tests suggest that the beneficial effects of thetraditional remedies based on H. hircinum could be attributed toits antiseptic, and in particular to its antifungal properties againstfungal pathogens of the respiratory tract. Moreover, the lack ofcytotoxicity indicates the presence of exploitable and promisingantimycotic principles for the development of an antifungaltherapy with limited cytotoxic side effects. Hence it encouragesfuture studies to assess the effective therapeutic properties ofH. hircinum subsp. majus with particular attention to thetreatment of fungal-associated pathologies of the respiratorytract.ETHICS STATEMENTPBMCs were obtained from buffy coats prepared from blooddonations collected at the Centro Trasfusionale c/o OspedaleSanta Chiara, Trento, after donor's signed informed consent.Study procedures were approved by the Comitato Etico perle Sperimentazioni Cliniche, Azienda Provinciale per i ServiziSanitari di Trento on the 12th February 2015.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSNT, TW, and FM conceived the study and wrote the manuscriptwith contributions from all authors.
