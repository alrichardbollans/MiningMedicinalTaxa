TWENTY-FIVEIMPORTANT FAMILIESThere are various ways of surveying useful plants. Iwill use the structure found in most textbooks on thesubject -- arrange the plants according to how we usethem, as opposed to some botanical scheme. Whilethis makes good sense, it obscures the fact that someplant families are economically more important thanothers. Which plant families are high in useful plants?Here is one analysis.FAMILIES WITH 25+ USEFUL PLANTSPlant Family Taxa %*01 Grass (Gramineae) 359 15.602 Legume (Leguminosae) 323 29.703 Rose (Rosaceae) 154 36.404 Nightshade (Solanaceae) 100 40.705 Sunflower (Compositae) 75 44.006 Myrtle (Myrtaceae) 73 47.207 Mallow (Malvaceae) 67 50.108 Mint (Labiatae) 55 52.509 Squash (Cucurbitaceae) 46 54.510 Mustard (Cruciferae) 43 56.411 Rue (Rutaceae) 43 58.212 Spurge (Euphorbiacecae) 41 60.013 Carrot (Umbelliferae) 38 61.714 Ginger (Zingiberaceae) 32 63.115 Palm (Palmae) 30 64.416 Goosefoot (Chenopodiaceae) 30 65.717 Yam (Dioscoreaceae) 29 67.018 Century Plant (Agavaceae) 25 68.0* The percentages shown are cumulative. In other words, thefirst 10 families contain 56.4% of all of the useful plantstallied by the authors. Data from Zeven & Zhukovsky (1975).A PLANT FAMILY SURVEYI have selected 25 plant families to summarize below.My choice is more subjective than I had originallyintended. Even if someone had tallied the number ofeconomic plants per family, I would argue that afamily that contains fifty plants of minor economicimportance should not rank higher than, for instance,Cannabaceae, which contains only marijuana andhops.Each of the descriptions below gives you the technicaland common name of the plant family, the number ofgenera and species it contains, a brief statement as toits distribution, the typical growth form (herbs, trees,etc. ), the typical number of flower parts, the fruittype, a list of economically important species, andtheir use(s). I have not included strictly ornamentalplants.Anacardiaceae (Cashew Family)73 genera and 850 species. Primarily tropical, butextending into the Mediterranean, Europe, Asia, andNorth America. Trees or shrubs (rarely vines), oftenwith resinous bark. Sepals 5; petals 5; stamens 10;carpels 3 or 5, but only 1 functional. Fruit a drupe.Useful plants include Anacardium occidentale, cashew(food, oil, dye); Mangifera indica, mango (food);Pistacia vera, pistachio (food); Rhus spp., sumac,lacquer tree (resins and dyes); Schinopsis spp.,quebracho (tanning); Schinus spp., peppertree(beverage, medicine, flavoring); Spondias spp.,golden apple, hog plum, mombin, Spanish plum(food); Toxicodendron spp., Chinese lacquer tree,poison-ivy, poison-oak, and poison-sumac (resins anddermatitis-producing).Apocynaceae (Dogbane Family)215 genera and 2100 species. Cosmopolitan,especially well-represented in the tropics. Trees orshrubs (rarely perennial herbs), typically with a milkysap. Sepals 5; petals 5; stamens 5; carpels 2. Fruit afollicle, berry, or capsule, the seeds sometimesconspicuously hairy. Useful plants include Apocynumcannabinum, Indian hemp (fiber, medicine); Carissagrandiflora, Natal plum (food); Landolphia spp.,landolphia rubber (latex); Catharanthus roseus,periwinkle (medicine); Funtumia elastica, lagos rubber(latex); Nerium spp., oleander (medicine, poison);Rauvolfia spp., devil pepper or snakeroot (medicine);Strophanthus spp., ouabin or kombe (arrow poisons);Thevetia spp., yellow oleander (fixed oil, medicine).Araceae (Aroid or Philodendron Family)106 genera and 2950 species. Primarily tropical, butwith many representatives in the temperate regions.Mostly terrestrial herbs (rarely woody and epiphytic).Plant tissues often contain needle-like crystals ofcalcium oxalate and enzymes that can inflame andirritate the eyes, mouth, and throat.
