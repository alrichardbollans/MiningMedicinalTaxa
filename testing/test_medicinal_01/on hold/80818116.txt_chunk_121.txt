In these days al-most 120 chemical elements are known and 30 of them create the living matter, therefore are known as biogenic elements. Plants provide themselves with elements from air, soil and water. They are present within the compounds or in the form of ions and in some special cases they are unbound (e.g. oxygen). According to their representation in organisms, the biogenic elements are divided into three groups: macro-biogenic, micro-biogenic and trace ele-ments. Macro-biogenic elements (C, O, H, N, S, P, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, Fe) have a building function, micro-biogen-ic elements (Cu, I, Mo, Mn, Zn, Co) are parts of enzymes and their function is catalytic, while trace elements (Al, As, B, Br, F, Li, Ni, Se, Si, Ti, V) are presented less than 0.001% and their biological role still remain undiscovered. The content of these elements vary a lot depending on many factors. Nevertheless, edible plant represent biologi-cal source of these elements for other living organisms in-cluding humans. Thus, Chenopodium spp. (Amaranthace-ae) is being used as a leafy vegetable and subsidiary grain crop in different parts of the world due to its rich nutrition-al quality and its ability to grow in stress conditions. The Chenopodium genus comprises numerous species of perennial and annual plants that grow as herbaceous plant or as shrubs and small trees. In the flora of the Re-public of Macedonia (RM), 15 species of this genus oc-cur including C. botrys and C. album. Dried herbal parts of C. botrys are used from local people for preparing infu-sions or liquid extracts with diuretic, antispasmodic, car-minative and antidiarrheal properties while fresh leaves of C. album are known as substitute of some green leafy veg-etables such as spinach. These two plant species have not been issue of chemical characterisation so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was determination of the content of selected biogenic elements of wild samples of C. botrys and C. album, collected from different localities of the Re-public of Macedonia.Materials and methodsPlant material (25 specimens), consisting of aerial flowering part (herba) and dried roots (radix) of two Che-nopodium species (C. album and C. botrys), was collect-ed from wild specimens on different localities in R. Mace-donia, during 2012 and 2013. Collected plant material was air-dried and preserved in paper bags until analysis, when it was minced and homogenised appropriately.For mineralization purposes 0.5 g of plant material were placed in a Teflon digestion vessels (OMNI/xp 1500), 7 mL (69%, m/V) HNO3 and 2 mL H2O2 (30%, m/V) were added, the vessels were capped closed, and after 24 hours were placed in the rotor of the Mars microwave digestion (CEM, USA). The digestion was carried out on 180 degC in S5 PP 238500Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 499 - 500 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationstwo steps, first 25 min and then additional 15 min. The digests were filtered on filter paper (Munktell, Sweden), quantitatively transferred to 25 mL calibrated flasks, dilut-ed with demineralised water and analyzed for the select-ed elements.All analyzed elements (Ca, K, Mg, P, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) were determined by the application of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) (Varian, 715-ES) applying an ultrasonic nebulizer CETAC (ICP/U-5000AT+) for better sensitivity. The optimal in-strumental parameters for this technique were published previously (Balabanova et al., 2010). All results were cal-culated on a dry mass basis (mg/kg d.m.). Samples were made in triplicates. Each data represents the mean +- 2 stan-dard deviation of three samples.Results and discussionThe two analyzed species of Chenopodium contained large amounts of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P), which ranged from 961 mg/kg for P to 40907 mg/kg for K, in dried aerial flowering part (herba) of C. botrys and C. album. The most abundant macro-biogenic element in all analysed samples of herba was K (14136-40907 mg/kg), followed by Ca (7405-14146 mg/kg), Mg (1082-5913 mg/kg) and P (961-2752 mg/kg). The content of micro-biogenic elements in herba of C. al-bum and C. botrys was much lower, ranging from 4.0 mg/kg for Cu to 863.1 mg/kg for Fe. The most abundant mi-cro-biogenic element in the investigated samples of herba was Fe (33.3-863.1 mg/kg), followed by Na (14.6-606.0 mg/kg), Mn (9.4-177.8 mg/kg), Zn (11.8-27.9 mg/kg) and Cu (4.0-15.6 mg/kg). The content of macro-biogenic elements in roots (ra-dix) of C. album and C. botrys was lower when compared with the herba of both species, ranging from 589 mg/kg for P to 15839 mg/kg for K. The most abundant macro-bio-genic element in all analysed samples from radix was K (14136-40907 mg/kg), followed by Ca (7405-14146 mg/kg), Mg (1082-5913 mg/kg) and P (961-2752 mg/kg). The content of micro-biogenic elements in radix of C. album and C. botrys was lower than in herba, ranging from 4.0 mg/kg for Cu to 863.1 mg/kg for Fe. Fe was also the most abundant micro-biogenic element in all investigated spec-imens of radix (33.3-863.1 mg/kg), followed by Na (14.6-606.0 mg/kg), Mn (9.4-177.8 mg/kg), Zn (11.8-27.9 mg/kg) and Cu (4.0-15.6 mg/kg). According to literature data Bomkazi et al. (2013) found very high amount of K in young shoots and mature plant-leaves of C. album, (45799.3 mg/kg and 49028.6 mg/kg, respectively), while the contents of Ca and Mg were lower. Comparing to our results, the content of K, Ca and Mg was higher than in our Macedonian samples from herba of C. album. Smaller amounts of Fe (218.1 and 120.4 mg/kg), Zn (26.2 and 23.0 mg/kg) and Cu (14.0 and 9.1 mg/kg) were found also in young shoots and mature plant-leaves, respectively. In leaves of Indian C. album 452 mg/100 g K was found, followed by 150 mg/100 g Ca, and smaller amounts of Na, Mg, Zn, and Fe (43.0, 34.0, 24.0 and 4.2 mg/100 g, respectively) (Dey et al., 2013). Obtained results for Macedonian C. album were in accordance with litera-ture data. According to literature, C. botrys was found to be very good bio-accumulator of heavy metals, especially for Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu, which content rich up to 4145, 175, 276 and 56 mg/kg, respectively (Malayeri et al., 2008). ConclusionThe content of biogenic elements in investigated Che-nopodium species (C. album and C. botrys) from Macedo-nian flora, showed that in both species the most abundant macro-biogenic element was K, in the dried aerial flower-ing part (herba) as well as in the dried roots (radix), fol-lowed by high amounts of Ca, Mg and P. Fe was predom-inant micro-biogenic element, present in higher amounts in the herba of C. botrys. Both species represent biologi-cal source of Mn, Zn and Cu. Differences in the contents of biogenic elements were high, depending on the harvesting locations. Further investigations are needed for analyzing the environmental influence on the contents of biogenic el-ements in Chenopodium species.

The different parts of this plant are frequently used in traditional medicine in order to treat several diseases such as skin infections, urinary troubles, insomnia and anxiety, digestive disorders, obesity, urinary troubles, diabetes, etc. (Bakhtaoui et al., 2014). Recent studies stipulate onto the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-ulcerogenic activities of aqueous extracts of some parts of this plant on rodents, as well as on the immunomodulatory properties on human T-cell activation, and on IL-2 mRNA expression (Benammar et al., 2014). In order to investigate more thoroughly onto the properties of Zizyphus lotus L., a study dealing with the qualitative evaluation of different methanolic extracts of this plant (originating from roots, stems, leaves and seeds), as well as of their antioxidant properties was carried on. Materials and methodsAll reagents were purchased from Merck and Sigma-Aldrich and were of analytical grade. Different parts (leaves, roots, stems and seeds) of Zizyphus lotus L. were collected from north-western Tunisia (Bousalem region) at different times of the year (March, September and October), in 2014. The vegetal materials were grounded into powder and were packed in polythene bags for further use. The methanol extracts of different parts of the plant were prepared in a similar manner. An amount of ten grams (10 g) of ground samples (leaves, stems, root and seeds respectively) were extracted with 100 mL methanol in a Soxhlet extractor. Several extraction processes were carried on. The obtained extracts were filtered and then concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The residues were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degC until the time of extract use. The qualitative evaluation of the different extracts of Zizyphus lotus was carried on by means of phytochemical screening (for alkaloids, saponnins, terpenes, tannins, quinones, and flavonoids) and thin layer chromatography, using a series of specific standards (catechin, rutine, quercitine, gallic and tannic acids). Determinations were carried out in accordance with procedures described in literature. In order to quantify the total phenol content, the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was used. The antiradical activities of the methanolic extracts of Zizyphus lotus was estimated using the stable free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-pycrylhydrazyl (DPPH), according to the method of Brand-Williams et al. (1995). Rutine and butyl hydroxyl toluene were used as positive controls.Results and discussionThe phytochemical analysis of the methanol extracts of the different parts (leaves, stems, root and seeds respec-tively) of Zizyphus lotus revealed that all of these contain (in different amounts) saponnins, terpens, tannins and fla-vonoids. The roots, stems and seeds also contain sterols. Excepting the leaves, coumarins and alkaloids were de-tected only in traces. The obtained results showed that the fruit seeds should be considered a source of fatty acids, be-S5 PP 239502Maced. pharm. bull., 62 (suppl) 501 - 502 (2016)Medicinal and aromatic plantsPoster presentationsing by far richer in saturated and poly saturated fatty acids than any other parts of the plant. In the case of the roots of Zizyphus lotus, the phytochemical results revealed a rich content in flavonoids, tannins and saponnins, compounds known for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. The same active compounds (flavonoids, saponins, tannins and alkaloids) detected in the Zizyphus lotus leaves, could explain the analgesic effects of this plant and its use in folk medicine. The analysis of the thin layer chromatographic plates revealed the presence of polyphenols, catechin, ru-tine, quercitin, tannic and gallic acids in the different parts of Zizyphus lotus.Regarding the antioxidant activity of the methanolic extracts originating from the different parts of Zizyphus lo-tus, it was found that the obtained efficient concentration values (IC50) ranged from 4.713 to 6.704 mg/mL, being sig-nificantly lower as compared to the positive controls: butyl hydroxyl toluene (21.441 mg/mL) and rutine (13.762 mg/mL). So, one could notice that the studied extracts show an important antioxidant activity. Among all, the seeds metha-nol extract showed an antioxidant activity five times great-er than butyl hydroxyl toluene's one, and three times great-er that the rutine's one. ConclusionThe phytochemical screening of the methanolic ex-tracts originating from different parts of Zizyphus lotus L. revealed the presence of some active compounds such as saponnins, terpenes, tannins, quinones and flavonoids. This content in active compounds confirms the importance of Zizyphus lotus L. in folk medicine, which could be con-sidered as a natural alternative to some synthetic products. The methanol extracts of different parts of Zizyphus lo-tus L. showed an important antioxidant activity.
