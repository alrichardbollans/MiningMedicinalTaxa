Very good at NER

Removing nonsci names adds improvements - improves precision without risking recall

## Examples

In some cases adding examples has meant it just adds those examples to the output

## General notes
False negatives are hard to diagnose

## Text Format

Some chunks are terrible to read e.g. 99, 107

## Human errors?

In 94, ricinus communis_purgative as med effect should be correct.

In 343, chelidonium majus_warts, chelidonium majus_skin protuberances etc.. should be correct.

In 107, equisetum arvense_relieves dyspepsia should be correct.
