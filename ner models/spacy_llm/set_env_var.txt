Open PyCharm and navigate to your project.

In the top menu, click on Run and then select Edit Configurations... from the dropdown menu.

In the Run/Debug Configurations dialog, you will see a list of configurations on the left. Select the configuration you use to run your project. If you haven't created a specific configuration, it might just be listed as <Default> or Python.

Look for the Environment variables field. There is a text box where you can enter the variables directly in the format KEY=VALUE;KEY2=VALUE2, or you can click on the ... button to open a more user-friendly dialog where you can add and remove variables.

In the Environment Variables dialog, click the + button to add a new variable. You will be prompted to enter the name and value for the variable:

For the name, enter OPENAI_API_KEY.
For the value, enter your actual OpenAI API key (which you should have received from OpenAI).


Once you have added both variables, click OK to close the Environment Variables dialog.

Back in the Run/Debug Configurations dialog, click Apply to save the changes and then OK to close the dialog.

Now, every time you run your project using this configuration, PyCharm will set the OPENAI_API_KEY
