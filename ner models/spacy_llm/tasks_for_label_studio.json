      "text": "Determination of Mineral Composition and Heavy Metal Content of Some Nutraceutically Valued Plant Products Rajeev Bhat & K. Kiran & A. B. Arun & A. A. Karim Received: 1 July 2009 /Accepted: 24 August 2009 /Published online: 16 September 2009 # Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009 Abstract Minerals and heavy metal concentrations of 23 plants (arial parts, leaves, bark, stem, root, rhizome, dried berries, seeds) possessing health-promoting effects and used in indigenous medicines (as medicinal food) were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic spectrometry. Vital essential minerals and heavy metals were present in all the samples analyzed. The majority of the plant materials were rich in some of the essential minerals like Na, K, Ca, Fe, Mg, Cu, Mn, and Zn, which are known to be beneficial for health. The plant material of Vitiveria zizinalis had highest concentration of toxic heavy metals, including arsenic (53.1 mg/100 g), chromium (6.74 mg/100 g), cobalt (10.2 mg/100 g), mercury (3.6 mg/100 g), and nickel (3.28 mg/100 g). Results of the present study provide vital data on the availability of some essential minerals, which can be useful to provide dietary information for designing value-added foods and for food biofortification. Apart from this, data on the contam- inant levels of heavy metals highlights the necessity on the quality and safety concerns about their use. Keywords Minerals . HeavyMetals . Nutraceuticals . Quality . Safety Introduction Plants and their products have always played a substantial role in human welfare by satisfying various essential needs ranging from food to medicines. Currently, functional foods or the nutraceuticals of plant origin have gained in popularity and constitute a major share of the health care market (Bhat and Sridhar 2008; Bhat and Karim 2009). Today, consumers are quite practical and choosy in their approach to diet; they are interested in incorporating high nutrient levels with adequate amount of essential minerals into their normal diet, preferably with sources from plant origin. The expansion of the mineral supplement industry is a direct indication of the gaining importance of minerals to consumers. In this regard, interest has grown in finding traditionally consumed plant products (e.g. herbs, spices) that might not only have culinary and medicinal properties but that also are abundant in essential micronutrients. Most of the minerals, even at threshold levels, contribute significantly to normal growth and play a pivotal role in biochemical functions and essential enzyme systems. Plant products play a significant role in traditional medicine systems, and the majority of consumers have the misconception that these products are inherently safe for consumption. However, there is concern among researchers that plants might accumulate heavy metals at significantly high levels when grown in polluted soil (Kalac and Svoboda 2000). If true, this will reflect the failure of good agricultural and manufacturing practices and quality assur- ance. Purity issues of plant-based drugs are also of high concern (Mazzanti et al. 2008). Hence, studying the R. Bhat (*) :A. A. Karim Food Technology Division, School of Industrial Technology, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Penang, Malaysia e-mail: rajeevbhat@usm.my K.

Methods (2010) 3:181-187 DOI 10.1007/s12161-009-9107-y presence of unwanted heavy metals and their concentrations in plant species used as traditional medicines and recom- mended to be incorporated in the normal food is a necessity. Of late, numerous efforts have been made to determine the mineral and heavy metal contents of herbal, medicinal, and aromatic plants, vegetables, and even wines from various parts of the world (Aberoumand and Deokule 2009; Galgano et al. 2008; Lavilla et al. 1999; Miller-Cebert et al. 2009; Tuzen et al. 2007). Trace elements and heavy metals have certain health benefits at lower concentrations, but at higher levels, they can be toxic and pose health risks (Schumacher et al. 1991); thus, it is important to determine the levels of these compounds in common, popular, and widely used herbal plants (or as medicinal foods). Detection of mineral and heavy metal concentrations in various foods has been conducted mainly using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) with flame atomiza- tion and a graphite furnace. However, other alternative, more reliable, and accurate methods are available, such as: inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, neutron activation analysis, and X-ray fluorescence methods (Knapp 1991). In this study, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used as this is a multi-element technique which allows fast and accurate analysis of nearly 75 elements of the periodic table. The major objective of this study was to evaluate and provide baseline information on the mineral composition and heavy metal contents of some popular and commer- cially valuable plants from the Indian market that possess high nutraceutical value. If at least a few of the plants were found to have high mineral contents, they might have the potential to be used for biofortification and development of new food products. Materials and Methods Sample Collection and Identification Certain common and popular plant materials that have therapeutic and nutraceutical value and are used in indigenous ayurvedic medicines were purchased from a leading local market dealer (from Mysore, India). The samples purchased were freshly harvested ones (less than 2 weeks) with no apparent physical damage. The materials (a total of 23 plants consisting of arial parts, leaves, bark, stem, root, rhizome, dried berries, seeds) were air dried at room temperature (25+-1degC) and ground into fine powder in a mortar and pestle to avoid chromium contamination from stainless steel utensils. The powder was placed temporarily in air-tight polyethylene pouches until further analysis. The identity of the plant material was confirmed with assistance from local practitioners and botanists. Table 1 lists the common name, scientific name, family, parts used, and the medicinal/health-promoting effects of the plant materials used in this study. Preparation and Analysis The minerals and heavy metal [aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), mercury (Hg), potassium (K), sodium (Na), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn)] contents of the powdered samples were deter- mined using the AOAC (1990) method. Briefly, a known amount of the sample was digested with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and perchloric acid (10:0.5:2, v/v), and the analysis was conducted using the ICP-OES (Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, USA). Table 2 lists the conditions and parameters used. All the glassware were cleaned by soaking overnight in a 10% nitric acid solution and then rinsing three times with deionized water. Statistical Analysis Analysis of minerals and heavy metals were performed in replicates, and data are presented as mean+-SD (n=3) with one-way analysis of variance (significance level at P<0.05) was performed with statistical software (ORIGIN(r), version 6.0, Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Results and Discussion Table 3 depicts the mineral and heavy metal concentrations of the samples analyzed in this study. Values varied widely among samples, but in general, most samples were rich in the following essential minerals: Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, and Zn. These minerals serve as structural components of tissues, function in cellular and basal metabolism, and help maintain water and acid-base balance (Smith 1988). The abundances of K, Mg, and Ca agree with earlier data from many of the plant specimens (Lavilla et al. 1999). Artemisia vulgaris had the highest levels of Ca (3,441.8 mg/100 g), whereas Annona squamosa had the lowest (3.72 mg/100 g). Ca is a major component of bone, assists in tooth development, helps regulate endo- and exo- enzymes, and plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure (Brody 1994). Using plant-based Ca as a nutri- tional supplement might be advantageous for consumers who are allergic to animal-based food sources or who practice strict vegetarianism. Cu was the highest in Berberis aristata (134.96 mg/100 g) and lowest in Sida cordifolia (0.05 mg/100 g). Vitiveria 182 Food Anal.

Methods (2010) 3:181-187 183 zizinalis had the highest concentrations of Fe and Zn (6,413.3 and 5.93 mg/100 g, respectively). Deficiency of zinc and iron in the diet is a widespread problem and a matter of great concern, especially in developing countries where people rely more on vegetarian diets. These essential trace elements are involved with vital immune system (Zn) and metabolic functions and are intrinsic components of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome (Fe) (Hemalatha et al. 2007). Hence, further study of V. zizinalis might prove this species to be a useful dietary supplement to provide Zn and Fe, especially for vegetarians. Piper longum had the highest potassium content (1,352.3 mg/100 g), Anethum sowa had the highest sodium concentration (170.69 mg/100 g), and Rauvolfia serpentina had the highest Mn concentration (856.4 mg/100 g). Perry (1972) reported a correlation between therapeutic properties of Cr and Mn in plants with diabetic and cardiovascular diseases. Plant materials with high concentrations of the above-mentioned micronutrient elements will definitely play an important role in maintenance of human health when taken at recommended levels. Earlier research on humans and livestock has shown that optimal intakes of elements such as Na, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn can reduce individual risk factors for health problems such as cardiovascular disease (Mertz 1982; Sanchez- Castillo et al. 1998). Mayer and Vyklicky (1989) reported that these elements play a significant role in neurochemical transmission and also serve as constituents of biological molecules as a cofactor for various enzymes and in a variety of different metabolic processes. Minerals like Fe, Zn, and Mn are also recognized to be potential antioxidants (Talwar et al. 1989), which are involved in strengthening the immune system. Similarly, Mg, and Zn are known to prevent cardiomyopathy, muscle degeneration, growth retardation, alopecia, dermatitis, immunological dysfunction, gonadal atrophy, impaired spermatogenesis, congenital malforma- tions, and bleeding disorders (Chaturvedi et al. 2004). Monitoring the presence and concentrations of heavy metals in plants/herbs used for medicinal and health- promoting effects is crucial because these levels can be used as an indicator of the surrounding pollution and because they can have ill effects when consumed directly. According to Schilcher et al. (1987), the presence of toxic metals in the environment is quite varied and depends on various factors, such as pollution from industrial and traffic emissions, the use of purification mud and agricultural expedients such as Cd-containing dung and the use of organic Hg fungicides and insecticides containing lead arsenate. In the present study, the heavy metals Al, Ba, Cd, and Mo were not detectable, and lead was present but below detection levels in all samples analyzed. In contrast, As, Co, Cr, and Ni were detected in almost all samples, but they were present in low concentrations (Table 3). The concen- trations of As and Co were highest in V. zizinalis, (53.1 and 10.2 mg/100 g, respectively), and this was the only plant material that was positive for the presence of Hg (3.6 mg/ 100 g). Arsenic is considered to be one of the most toxic elements, and the provisional tolerance (weekly intake) is Table 2 Operating conditions of the ICP-OES Parameters Specifications Analysis mode Normal Rinsing time Fixed (5.0 s) Rinsing pump speed High speed Transfer time 10.0 s Stabilization time 5.0 s Transfer pump speed Normal Delay of synchronization 0 s Stop of pump during replacement No Power 1,000 W Normal speed of pump 20 Plasma gas flow rate 12 L/min Sheath gas flow rate 0.2 L/min Auxiliary flow rate 0.0 Sheath gas stability time 3.0 s Nebulization flow rate 0.02 Nebulization pressure 1.0 bar Sample uptake 1 mL/min Argon humidifier No Table 1 (continued) Botanical name Common/English name Family Parts used Therapeutic uses +Cinnamomum Tamala Buch.

Methods (2010) 3:181-187 185 15 mg/kg body weight (FAO/WHO 1989). In an earlier work, Liang et al. (1998) measured various metallic elements in commercial Chinese medicines using AAS and reported approximately 10 mg/100 g of arsenic in the samples analyzed. However, the results on Hg (Table 3) were contradictory to an earlier report by Dahanukar et al. (1998) who found high levels of Hg (in six samples) that exceeded the permissible amounts (1-7.5 ppm). Contami- nation by Hg occurs mainly via its usage in dental amalgam, electric switches, and batteries, which then finds its way into soil. Hg poisoning causes inflammation of the mouth, stomach, and colon and acute abdominal pain, and it affects the kidneys. Chromium is one of the trace metal nutrients that are essential to humans and animals. Its principal role appears to be in helping to maintain normal glucose tolerance in the body (Strickland et al. 1972). Chromium was highest in V. zizinalis (6.74 mg/100 g), followed by Bacopa monnieri (2.88 mg/100 g), and it was lowest in Chlorophytum borivilianum (0.08 mg/100 g). The main source of Cr contamination occurs via the use of plating metal, as an alloy of stainless steel, and in tanning of hides. Because Cr is not known to have any toxic effects, no maximum intake limit has been set. However, in the UK, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy has recommended that Cr intake should be >25ug/kg body weight for adults and between 0.1 and 1.0ug/kg body weight for children and adolescents (COMA 1991). Momardica chasintia contained the highest levels of Ni (3.86 mg/100 g), while S. cordifolia (0.01 mg/100 g) had the lowest. Ni is exclusively used as an alloy in stainless steel, in coins, in metal plating (electric water heaters), and in batteries. It has been reported to cause allergies and eczema of skin (Jorhem et al. 1996). However, no maximum limit has been set for Nickel in food. The presence of heavy metals in plant samples can be directly attributed to the surrounding pollution in the environment (e.g., atmospheric and water pollution). Wong et al. (1993) reported the presence of heavy metals (cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead, zinc, and mercury) in 42 Chinese herbal medicines and attributed their presence to contamination occurring during air-drying and preservation. Soil condition (e.g., heavily polluted) also plays a significant role in determining the heavy metal concentrations of plant materials used for medicinal purposes (Kabelitz 1998). Januz et al. (1994) ascertained the contents of heavy metals to be correlated to industrialized regions, and they concluded that the plants grown in an industrialized region had higher contents of heavy metals than plants grown in a second less- industrialized region. The mineral and heavy metal concentrations reported herein might not be on par with some of the earlier reports on medicinal plants. The differences observed might be due to different growth conditions, genetic factors, geographical variations in the level of soil fertility, efficiency of mineral uptake, and the analytical procedures employed (Ozcan and Akgul 1998). From the study, we conclude that measuring minerals and heavy metal concentrations in nutraceutically valued plant produce is highly significant not only from nutritional point of view but also to assess the quality when used as herbal drugs. The result of the present study provides vital information on the mineral composition for a few of the popular and nutraceutically valued plants of India, which need to be explored further to be used as a food supplement or for food biofortification to exploit the potential health- promoting properties."

There are 230 to 240 known Bidens species. Among them, Bidens pilosa is a representative perennial herb, globally distributed across temperate and tropical regions. B. pilosa has been traditionally used in foods and medicines without obvious adverse effects. Despite significant progress in phytochemical and biological analyses of B. pilosa over the past few years, comprehensive and critical reviews of this plant are anachronistic or relatively limited in scope.The present review aims to summarize up-to-date information on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of B. pilosa from the literature. In addition to botanical studies and records of the traditional use of B. pilosa in over 40 diseases, scientific studies investigating the potential medicinal uses of this species and its constituent phytochemicals for a variety of disorders are presented and discussed.The structure, bioactivity, and likely mechanisms of action of B. pilosa and its phytochemicals are emphasized. Although some progress has been made, further rigorous efforts are required to investigate the individual compounds isolated from B. pilosa to understand and validate its traditional uses and develop clinical applications.The present review provides preliminary information and gives guidance for further basic and clinical research into this plant. 1. Introduction The United Nations World Health Organization estimates that as many as 5.6 billion people, 80% of the world popu- lation, utilize herbal medicine for primary health care [1].1 Plants have formed the foundation of complicated traditional medicine systems for thousands of years. Medicinal herbs are applied to treat a wide range of disease categories. The first written documentation of the use of medicinal herbs dates from the 26th century BCE in Mesopotamia, and the first record of the use of medicinal herbs by the Egyptians and Greeks dates from 18th century BCE and the 5th century BCE, respectively. Starting around the 11th century BCE, the Chinese and Indians started to develop herbal medicine systems, Chinese herbal medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine, respectively, that continue to be widely practiced today [2]. Therefore, since antiquity, medicinal herbs have played a prominent role in human health. B. pilosa is an easy-to-grow herb that is widely distributed all over the world. It is considered to be a rich source of food and medicine for humans and animals [3, 4]. There is increasing global interest in the use of B. pilosa as shown by the many studies conducted on the plant in recent years. The folkloric use of B. pilosa has been recorded in America, Africa, Asia, andOceania [5]. To explore the potential clinical application of B. pilosa, it is important to link its traditional use with rigorous evidence-based scientific study.The present review focuses on recent studies on the botany, traditional 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 1: Taxonomy of B. pilosa [6].

The information provided here highlights the pos- sible usefulness of B. pilosa and its isolated compounds and offers insights into possible future research directions. Studies of B. pilosa are divided into three groups: (1) the botany, ethnomedical uses, plant chemistry, pharmacology, and biosafety of B. pilosa; (2) scientific studies that validate the ethnomedical uses ofB. pilosa; and (3) the therapeutic and future research potential of B. pilosa. 1.1. Botany. B. pilosa was first collected and named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 [3]. Taxonomically, it is assigned to the Bidens genus (Asteraceae) as shown in Table 1. This genus is estimated to include 230 to 240 species worldwide [3, 4]. B. pilosa has several varieties such as B. pilosa var. radiata, var. minor, var. pilosa, and var. bisetosa. Alongside examination of morphological traits, authentication of B. pilosa can be aided by chemotaxonomy and molecular characterization [8]. B. pilosa is an erect, perennial herb widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions. B. pilosa is either glabrous or hairy, with green opposite leaves that are serrate, lobed, or dissected. It has white or yellow flowers, and long narrow ribbed black achenes (seeds). It grows to an average height of 60 cm and a maximum of 150 cm in favorable environments [9] (Figure 1). B. pilosa prefers full sun and moderately dry soil. However, it can grow in arid and barren land from low to high elevations. With the advantage of being fast-growing, in the 1970s, the Food and Agricultural Organization actively promoted the cultivation of B. pilosa in Africa [10]. B. pilosa propagates via seeds. A single plant can produce 3000-6000 seeds. Dry mature seeds from B. pilosa can be germinated in 3 to 4 days in moist soil or after being soaking in water. Seeds are viable for at least 3 years [11]. Minimal agricultural techniques are required for B. pilosa cultivation. Due to its invasive tendencies, B. pilosa is generally considered to be a weed [12]. B. pilosa is thought to have originated in South America and subsequently spread all over the world [13]. Bidens species and their varieties bear vernacular names based on their characteristics. For example, Bidens species are known by such names as Spanish needles, beggar's ticks, devil's needles, cobbler's pegs, broom stick, pitchforks, and farmers' friends in English and some other languages because of their sticky achenes [9] and are sometimes known as xian feng cao (\"all bountiful grass\") in Chinese because of their prosperous growth. 1.2. Traditional Uses. B. pilosa is used as an herb and as an ingredient in teas or herbal medicines. Its shoots and leaves, dried or fresh, are utilized in sauces and teas [14, 15]. In the 1970s, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) promoted the cultivation of B. pilosa in Africa because it is easy to grow, edible, palatable, and safe [7]. The nutritional value of B. pilosa is shown in Table 2. All parts of B. pilosa plant, the whole plant, the aerial parts (leaves, flowers, seeds, and stems), and/or the roots, fresh or dried, are used as ingredients in folk medicines. It is frequently prepared as a dry powder, decoction, maceration or tincture [16]. Generally, this plant is applied as dry powder or tincture when used externally, and as a powder, maceration, or decoction when used as an internal remedy [15]. As summarized in Table 3, B. pilosa, either as a whole plant or different parts, has been reported to be useful in the treatment of more than 40 disorders such as inflamma- tion, immunological disorders, digestive disorders, infectious diseases, cancers, metabolic syndrome, wounds, and many others [26-29]. B. pilosa is usually ingested; however, it can also be utilized externally. For instance, fresh B. pilosa is used to treat snake bites and wounds [23], and in Trinidad and Tobago the aqueous solution of the leaves of B. pilosa is used to bathe babies and children [22]. B. pilosa is sometimes used alone; it is also used as an ingredient in medicinal mixtures together with other medicinal plants such as Aloe vera, Plectranthus mollis, Valeriana officinalis, andCissus sicyoides among others [17, 18, 20, 25]. Whether the commonly used mixtures of B. pilosa, or the mixtures of the compounds found in B. pilosa afford synergistic effects is not yet clear and needs to be verified by further studies. However, one study has suggested that B. pilosa varieties share similar phytochemical compositions and may be substituted for each other [8]. 2. Phytochemicals Interest in basic research and application of B. pilosa has increased since its first identification in 1753. This is mainly due to its wide application in medicines, foods, and drinks. Around 116 publications have documented the exploitation and medical use of B. pilosa. To date, 201 compounds comprising 70 aliphatics, 60 flavonoids, 25 terpenoids, 19 phenylpropanoids, 13 aromatics, 8 porphyrins, and 6 other compounds, have been identified from this plant as compiled previously [30]. The structures of these compounds are pre- sented in Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively. However, the association between B. pilosa phytochemicals and their bioactivities is not yet fully established and should become a future research focus. In the present review, we explore possible associations (Table 11), describe the importance of the known compounds in relation to their biological activity Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 Table 2: Nutritional facts about B. pilosa, courtesy of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization [7].

Com- pelling evidence suggests that the various diverse bioactivities reported for B. pilosa reflect its phytochemical complexity. B. pilosa is an extraordinary source of phytochemicals, particularly flavonoids and polyynes. Plant flavonoids are commonly reported to possess anticancer, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and other bioactivities. However, the bioactivi- ties of only seven of the 60 flavonoids present in B. pilosa have been studied.The bioactivities of the remaining 53 flavonoids are poorly understood and deserve further investigation. Other classes of compounds found inB. pilosa are also in need of further examination, as shown in Table 11. 3. Pharmacological Properties As outlined in Table 3, B. pilosa is traditionally used to treat a wide variety of ailments. Different preparations of its whole plant and/or parts have been purported to treat over 40 categories of illnesses. Scientific studies, although not extensive, have demonstrated that B. pilosa extracts and/or compounds have antitumor [43, 69, 77-83], antiinflamma- tory [27, 75, 79, 84-88], antidiabetic and antihyperglycemic [8, 24, 49, 51, 53], antioxidant [70, 89, 90], immunomodu- latory [50, 69], antimalarial [47, 77], antibacterial [47, 91, 92], antifungal [92, 93], antihypertensive, vasodilatory [28, 94], and antiulcerative [26] activities.

AntiCancer Activity. Folkloric reports revealed the pos- sible antitumor efficacy of B. pilosa, and several scientific in2 vitro studies have supported the claim that B. pilosa extracts and isolated compounds possess anti-cancer activities against a variety of cancer cells. Several studies have used bioassay guided isolation and fractionation methods to discover new compounds from B. pilosa. For example, Kviecinski and colleagues tested hydroalcoholic crude extracts, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions for anti-tumor activity [82]. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was assessed using brine shrimp, hemolytic, MTT, and neutral red uptake (NRU) assays. In vivo studies were performed using Ehrlich ascites carcinoma in isogenic BALB/c mice. Among them, 6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 4: Aliphatic natural products isolated from B. pilosa [30]."
