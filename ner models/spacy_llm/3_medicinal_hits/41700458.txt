Accumulation of oxidized nucleic acids causes genomic instability leading to senescence, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Phytoagents
are known to reduce the risk of cancer development; whether such effects are through regulating the extent of nucleic acid
oxidation remains unclear. Here, we outlined the role of reactive oxygen species in nucleic acid oxidation as a driving force in
cancer progression. The consequential relationship between genome instability and cancer progression highlights the importance
of modulation of cellular redox level in cancer management. Current epidemiological and experimental evidence demonstrate
the effects and modes of action of phytoagents in nucleic acid oxidation and provide rationales for the use of phytoagents as
chemopreventive or therapeutic agents. Vitamins and various phytoagents antagonize carcinogen-triggered oxidative stress by
scavenging free radicals and/or activating endogenous defence systems such as Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes or pathways.
Moreover, metal ion chelation by phytoagents helps to attenuate oxidative DNA damage caused by transition metal ions. Besides,
the prooxidant effects of some phytoagents pose selective cytotoxicity on cancer cells and shed light on a new strategy of cancer
therapy. The ‚Äúdouble-edged sword‚Äù role of phytoagents as redox regulators in nucleic acid oxidation and their possible roles in
cancer prevention or therapy are discussed in this review.
1. Nucleic Acid Oxidation as a Marker of
Oxidative Insult by Reactive Oxygen Species
and the Driving Force in Cancer Progression
The integrity of the genome is of crucial importance for
proper gene expression andDNA replication. Loss of genome
integrity jeopardizes normal cellular physiological activities
and leads to cellular pathological events such as senescence,
apoptosis, and tumorigenesis [1]. Under oxidative stress,
the level of genotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) is
abnormally elevated. ROS interact with and modify the
chemical properties of biomolecules inside the cell, which
causes oxidative insults such as oxidation of nucleic acids,
peroxidation of lipids [2], and denaturation of proteins [3].
Oxidative modification to DNA structure mainly occurs in
the form of base oxidation. Guanine, which possesses the
lowest oxidation potential of the DNA bases, is the most
frequent target of ROS. ROS-elicited changes in biomolecules
can be used as biomarkers to indicate the presence and
extent of oxidative insult. 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-
oxoG), the oxidation product of the DNA base guanine
is a well-characterized marker for oxidative stress-induced
DNA damage [4]. Following the oxidation of a DNA base,
genome integrity is at increased risk because the DNA repair
process, base excision repair (BER), can increase the level
of interrupted DNA strands resulting in indirect single-
strand break (SSB) [5], subsequently leading to introduction
of mismatched base pairing during translesion DNA repair
[6]. As a consequence, genome instability and accumulation
of mutations lead to genetic heterogeneity in cancer cells
that drive the adaptive evolution of cancer colonies with
survival/expansion advantages [7]. Figure 1 shows the genetic

instability and heterogeneity caused by nucleic acid oxidation
in cancer cells which lead to carcinogenesis and cancer evolu-
tion. During BER, indirect SSB are produced as intermediates
after the removal of oxidized bases and their corresponding
nucleotides. If SSB takes place at adjacent regions on both
strands of the same chromosome, genome instability can
ensue. Meanwhile, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
is activated after binding to SSB and consumes NAD+ to
synthesize polyA chains which then recruit important DNA
repair enzymes, such as DNA polymerase ùõΩ and DNA
ligase III. PARP also induces apoptosis through increased
poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) levels that facilitate the release of
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) frommitochondria and elicit
apoptosis. Otherwise, depletion of NAD due to excessive
PARP activity will further deplete the ATP pool and lead to
cell lysis (necrosis). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
promotes the switch to a specialized DNA polymerase with a
larger active site that tolerates damaged bases at the expense
of sacrificing fidelity during translesion synthesis/repair.
Lower fidelity increases the chance of mismatch which gives
rise to point mutations. The accumulation of genome insta-
bility and point mutations results in genome heterogeneity
among cells and, chronologically, within cells. Tumor initi-
ation is triggered by mutations that can activate oncogenes
or silence tumor suppressor genes. Further mutations that
give rise to gain/loss of function of genes then grant tumor
cells the ability to resist growth control. Further gain/loss
of function continues to drive cancer progression enabling
tumor cells to escape layers of control and become capable
of invasion and metastasis.
Elevated levels of oxidative DNA lesions (8-oxoG) have
been noted in various tumors, supporting the argument that
such damage contributes to the etiology of cancer. Therefore,
8-oxoG has been established as an important biomarker
which is widely used to measure oxidative stress and assess
risk of tumor initiation after exposure to various carcinogenic
substances and pollutants [8]. In a cohort study involving
esophageal cancer patients, more extensive oxidative damage
to DNA as indicated by 8-oxoG levels was detected in cancer
patients, in comparison to a healthy control group. Smoking
habits and alcohol consumption, risk factors for esophageal
cancer, were also correlated with the observed levels of
oxidative DNA damage [9].
Oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation is also asso-
ciated with the early stages of carcinogenesis [10]. Mal-
ondialdehyde (MDA), the product of lipid peroxidation,
can induce the formation of DNA adducts which leads to
mutagenesis. In an epidemiological study of breast cancer, the
level of the malondialdehyde-DNA adduct, 3-(2-deoxy-ùõΩ-D-
erythro-pentofuranosyl) pyrimido [1,2-ùõº]purin-10(3H) one
(M1dG), was significantly higher in breast tissue specimens
from cancer patients than in those from healthy individuals
[11].Therefore, other than 8-oxoG, the level ofM1dGhas been
employed as an indicator of cancer-associated oxidative DNA

Figure 2: Markers of oxidative DNA damage are elevated in cancer patients. ROS causes oxidative damage to biomolecules such as DNA,
lipids, and proteins, and the resulting end products are often detrimental to normal cell physiological functions. As the result of DNA base
oxidation, 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG) can serve as a biomarker of primary oxidative DNA damage.When lipids are attacked by ROS, secondary
DNA damage arises due to malondialdehyde (MDA), the end production of lipid peroxidation that can covalently bind to guanine and form
MDA-DNA adduct (M1dG). In human cancer patients, both 8-oxoG and M1dG are found to be elevated, suggesting a correlation between
higher oxidative stress and cancer.
damage. These markers are used as measures of antioxidant
activity in studies that assess the chemopreventive efficacy
of anticancer agents including phytochemicals [9, 12, 13]
(Figure 2).
2. Sources of ROS and Cellular
Antioxidant Defense
ROS are genotoxic and ubiquitous. They include the super-
oxide anion radical (O
2
‚àô‚àí), hydrogen peroxide (H
2
O
2
), the
hydroxyl radical (OH‚àô), and the nitric oxide radical (NO‚àô)
[14]. For maintenance of genome integrity and normal cell
physiological function, cells have developed strategies to
control ROS levels. Such control is known as antioxidant
defense [14]. Cellular redox status, the level of ROS, is the net
result of ROS arising from various origins and the capacity
of the cell to remove it by antioxidant defense. Many pre-
ventive/therapeutic regimens, including those phytoagent-
based, intervene in disease progression by fine-tuning the
level of ROS and the corresponding antioxidant responses in
the cell [15], and thus shifting the redox balance in favor of
human health. Introductions of the various origins of ROS
and cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms are outlined
below.
2.1. Origins of ROS. Sources of ROS can be divided into three
major categories: exogenous, endogenous, metal-catalyzed
(Figure 3(a)). Exogenously, ROS levels are mainly increased
by environmental and dietary factors. These factors may
serve as prooxidants that elicit ROS directly through chem-
ical reactions or through the inhibition of cellular anti-
oxidant defense or as substrates or stimulators of ROS-
producing enzymes. Environmental factors that increaseROS
production include ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, air
pollutants, cigarette smoke, pesticides, and industrial solvents
or chemicals. Dietary factors that induce ROS include food
containing peroxidized lipids (from rotten oil), polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH, from high-temperature pro-
cessed hydrocarbon-based food), and food additives (preser-
vatives).

Figure 3: The source and clearance of ROS. (a) Three major origins of ROS. The sources of ROS can be roughly classified into three
major categories: exogenous, endogenous, and transition metal ion-catalyzed. Exogenous sources of ROS can elicit radical chain reactions,
contain/produce ROS, or stimulate enzymatic ROS production. Endogenous sources of ROS include the various enzymes that produce
ROS as by-products or as signaling mediators or as antimicrobial agents during inflammation. Many of these enzymes can be activated
by stimulation by cytokines and growth factors, such as NOX, LOX, XO, and MPO. Some CYPs are inducible and can be upregulated by
environmental pollutants, dietary phytocompounds, or drugs. The transition metal ion-catalyzed Fenton-reaction produces highly reactive
hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide. (b) Layers of antioxidant defense. There are several layers of antioxidant defense. Basal level
antioxidant defenses provide buffering capacity upon ROS challenge. Radical scavengers can directly quench ROS, and metal-chelating
proteins can block ROS generation catalyzed by the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions. Further antioxidant capacity is provided by inducible
antioxidant enzymes that aremostly under the regulation of Nrf2/ARE signaling (see Figure 4). ROS can oxidize the thiol group of amino acid
residues leading to intermolecular or intramolecular disulfide bond formation. These disulfide bonds that are caused by oxidation can lead
to structural/functional alteration of proteins. These disulfide bonds can be reduced by the glutathione system and the thioredoxin system
allowing resumption of protein function. NADPH plays an indispensable role in the recycling of glutathione and thioredoxin, and therefore
metabolic enzymes that are involved in NADPH generation also account for antioxidant defense.
Endogenously, ROS are generated during metabolic pro-
cesses, such as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation,
peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation [16], catabolism of
xenobiotics by cytochrome P450monooxygenase (CYP) [17],
purine by xanthine oxidase (XO) [18, 19], and lipid/fatty acid
by cyclooxygenase (COX) [20, 21] or lipoxygenase (LOX)
[22, 23]. Inflammation is another important endogenous
source of ROS. During inflammation, ROS are generated
via NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase which can protect
against microbe or virus invasion; however, they might
also be injurious to adjacent cells [24‚Äì27]. The positive
feedback loop between oxidative insult, inflammation, and
carcinogenesis is well recognized and appreciated as one of
the hallmarks of cancer [28]. In metal-catalyzed generation
of ROS, transition metal ions such as iron, copper, and
chromium catalyze Fenton or Fenton-like reactions [29]
that donate electrons and thus promote the production of
hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide [30].

Figure 4: Inducible antioxidant defense regulated by Nrf2/Keap1 and the antioxidant response element. Under normal physiological
conditions, the transcription factor Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Keap1. Keap1 recruits ubiquitin ligase E3 which then ubiquitinates
Nrf2 and directs it to the proteasome degradation pathway. The increased level of ROS promotes the dissociation of Nrf2 and Keap1, either
via activation of kinases that phosphorylate Nrf2 or by oxidization of key cysteine residues that govern Keap1 activity. The dissociated Nrf2
is then translocated into the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE). ARE-regulated genes are then transcriptionally
activated, including a panel of antioxidant enzymes or proteins, such as glutathione synthetase (GSS), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione
peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxin (TRX), thioredoxin reductase (TRR), and peroxiredoxin (PRX). These inducible antioxidant enzymes then
provide further ROS clearance capacity and antioxidant defense mechanism to exert a cytoprotective effect.
2.2. Cellular Antioxidant DefenseMechanisms: Control of ROS
Levels and Repair of Oxidized DNA Bases. Proper control
of ROS is critical for the maintenance of redox balance
and genome integrity. Otherwise, excessive levels of ROS
would overwrite the roles of ROS as signaling mediators and
jeopardize the normal physiological processes inside the cell.
Several layers of antioxidant defense have been proposed as
preventive strategies against nucleic acid oxidation, including
nonenzymatic removal of ROS by scavenger molecules,
chelation of metals that catalyze ROS formation, inducible
enzymatic removal of ROS, and the DNA repair system
responsible for oxidative DNA lesion. Cellular molecules
that can serve as radical scavengers form a first line of
defense in the control of ROS levels (Figure 3(b)). These
molecules include metabolites such as vitamin C, vitamin E,
ubiquinol-10, and urate, as well as the tripeptide glutathione
(GSH) and the thioredoxin (TRX) system [31]. Meanwhile,
cellular metal-chelating proteins play key roles in controlling
the level of free metal ions and thus enhance or prevent
ROS generation by metal-catalyzed Fenton of Fenton-like
reactions. These proteins include ferritin [32, 33], transferrin
[34], coeruloplasmin [35], and metallothionein [36].
ROS scavengers and metal-binding proteins do not
provide complete protection from ROS damage. Therefore,
another layer of protection is provided in the form of
enzymatic removal of ROS. Superoxide dismutase (SOD)
is responsible for the transformation of superoxide anions
into hydrogen peroxide, which is subsequently transformed
into oxygen and water by catalase (CAT) or into water by
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [14]. The removal of hydrogen
peroxide by GPx consumes the reduced form of glutathione
(GSH) and generates the oxidized form (GSSG). GSSG can
later be recycled by glutathione reductase (GR) and so replen-
ish the GSH pool. Notably, metabolic enzymes responsible
for NADPH production are critical factors in maintaining
cellular redox balance, because NADPH is an indispensable
factor responsible for the recycling of GSH and TRX by
GR and thioredoxin reductase (TRR). Defects in NADPH
supplying enzymes, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge-
nase (G6PD) deficiency in humans, compromise recycling
of glutathione and thioredoxin and so weaken antioxidant
capacity and confer susceptibility toward oxidative insult
[37]. SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, TRR, and NADPH producing
enzymes together, therefore, increase the capacity of the cell
to remove ROS through enzymatic means (Figure 3(b)).
Cellular antioxidant defense is inducible and often up-
regulated in response to oxidative stress or plant antioxidants.
Cells sense and respond to changes in redox status by nuclear
factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)/kelch-like ECH-
associated protein 1 (Keap1) complex [38, 39], which when
dissociated allows Nrf2 nuclear translation and binding to
the antioxidant response element (ARE) to transactivate
antioxidant enzymes and thus further elevate antioxidant
capacity [40] (Figure 4). Under normal physiological condi-
tions, transcription factor Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytosol
by Keap1, which recruits ubiquitin ligase E3 that ubiquitinates

Figure 5: Repair of oxidative DNA damage introduces genome heterogeneity and instability. ROS causes oxidation of DNA bases which
then elicit base excision repair machineries. First, the oxidized base is cleaved by glycosylase leaving an apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP site).
Second, the AP site is recognized by AP endonuclease that cleaves the phosphodiester bonds to remove the AP nucleotide and create the
single-strand break (SSB) intermediate. DNA polymerase then resynthesizes the missing part of the DNA and later DNA ligase seals the nick.
The low fidelity of the translesion DNA polymerase increases the chance of mismatched base-pairing and thus, leads to accumulation of point
mutations which creates genome heterogeneity.
Nrf2 and directs it to the proteasome degradation pathway.
Increased levels of ROS promote the dissociation of Nrf2
and Keap1, either by the oxidization of key cysteine residues
that govern Keap1 activity or via the activation of kinases
(e.g., protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen activated protein-
kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) [41],
and protein kinase (PKR-) like endoplasmic reticulum kinase
(PERK) that phosphorylate Nrf2 [42]. The dissociated Nrf2
then translocates into the nucleus and binds to the ARE.
ARE-regulated genes, such as glutathione synthetase (GSS),
GR, GPx, TRX, TRR, and peroxiredoxin (PRX) are then
transcriptionally activated [40]. These inducible antioxidant
enzymes provide further ROS clearance capacity and thus
confer cytoprotective effects ensuing Nrf2 activation in
response to oxidative stress stimulation during inflammation
[43] or in the presence of redox-modulating phytoagents
[44, 45] (Figure 4).
As nonenzymatic and enzymatic control of ROS levels
cannot guarantee perfect/complete protection against ROS
damage, oxidative damage continues to occur and accu-
mulate in cells. To alleviate the negative effects elicited by
oxidized biomolecules, especially DNA, cells have evolved
sophisticated specific enzymatic repair systems. One such
system, base excision repair (BER), repairs oxidized DNA
bases (Figure 5) [5]. During BER, the oxidized base is first
recognized and removed by DNA glycosylase leaving an
apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site which is later recognized and
cleaved by AP endonuclease on the phosphodiester backbone
and leaves a DNA single-strand break (SSB) intermediate
with a free 3Û∏Ä†-OH end. Subsequently, PPAR binds to the
SSB and recruits DNA polymerase ùõΩ and DNA ligase which
synthesizes the missing nucleic acid and seals the SSB to
restore genome integrity. Nonetheless, PCNA, a DNA clamp
protein that associates with and coordinates the DNA repair
pathway, facilitates a DNA polymerase switch to the special-
ized Family Y DNA polymerase and increases the potential
of generating point mutation. Family Y DNA polymerase
carries out translesion DNA synthesis. The low fidelity of
Family Y DNA polymerase introduces a higher frequency of
mismatched base pairing than in regular DNA synthesis and
therefore increases the incidence of point mutations [46, 47].
In the last step, DNA ligase seals the nick between the de novo
synthesized nucleotide and adjacent nucleotides and com-
pletes the base excision repair process. The point mutations
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 7
introduced during translesion DNA repair lead to genome
heterogeneity between different cells and, chronologically,
within the same cell (Figure 5).
3. ‚Äò‚ÄòDouble-Edged Sword‚Äô‚Äô Role of Phytoagents
as Redox Regulators in Cancer Management
3.1. Phytoagents in Cancer Management. Plants produce a
remarkably diverse array of secondary metabolites (phyto-
chemicals), many of which have evolved to combat microbial
attack, resist environmental stress, or function as signal-
ing molecules in interplant communication [48]. Human
civilizations have used botanical preparations for treating
and preventing various human diseases throughout history.
Today, more than half of the anticancer drugs in clinical
use are natural products or their derivatives and many are
plant-derived phytochemicals [49, 50]. As cancer remains a
major threat to health worldwide, there is global demand
for more affordable and effective therapeutic alternatives.
Moreover, concerns about drug resistance and the side effects
of conventional therapeutic regimens currently used for
cancer have renewed interest in phytochemicals derived from
dietary foods and traditional medicines [51‚Äì55].
The US National Cancer Institute (NCI) has identified
more than 1,000 different phytoextracts or phytochemicals
that possess cancer-preventive activity [15] and the compo-
nents responsible for many of the cancer chemopreventive
effects of various edible plants have been determined. For
example, the cancer preventive effects of allium species
(e.g., garlic) and cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli and
watercress) are attributed to organosulfur compounds (e.g.,
diallyl trisulfide) and isothiocyanates (e.g., sulforaphane
(SFN) and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC)), respectively
[56]. Other naturally occurring phytochemicals found in
fruits, vegetables, spices, herbs, beverages, and medicinal
plants, such as resveratrol [57], genistein [58], curcumin [59],
(‚Äì)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) [60], and sesquiterpene
lactones (e.g., deoxyelephantopin [61‚Äì63], artemisinin [64],
and parthenolide) [65‚Äì67] have been reported to modulate
multiple signaling cascades that are known to deregulate
cancer cell activities [68]. Interestingly, these representative
phytocompounds (Figure 6) exert their anticancer cell effects
throughmodulating ROS activity and oxidative stress in can-
cer cells by antioxidant, pro-oxidant, or a dual as antioxidant
and prooxidant under certain physiological or pathological
conditions. The important dual, seemingly oppositional role
of phytoagents as redox regulators involved in nucleic acid
oxidation in cancer cells, is discussed below.
3.2. Phytoagents as Antioxidants for Cancer Prevention. In
general, phytoagents with antioxidant properties are poten-
tially useful in cancer prevention because they can protect
healthy cells fromoxidativeDNAdamage through direct rad-
ical scavenging, upregulation of antioxidant defense system,
metal ion chelation, and/or additional anti-inflammatory
activity. The latest developments in the evaluation of the
antioxidant effects and related defense systems or molecular
mechanisms of phytocompounds, with focus on oxidative
DNA damage as a biomarker in cancer prevention, are
discussed below.
3.2.1. Major Antioxidant Mechanisms of Action of Phytoagents
(a) Direct ROS Scavenging. Phytoagents can attenuate ROS
insults on biomolecules through direct scavenging of ROS.
‚ÄúScavenging‚Äù refers to direct chemical modification of ROS
and their stabilization by chemical reduction or electron-
donation. In this way, the reduced form of a phytoagent
molecule is consumed to buffer injurious ROS that might
otherwise cause DNA damage. Phytoagents might have
different scavenging capacity for different ROS and free
radical species. For example, vitamin E and the carotenes
have long polyunsaturated fatty acid chains, while vitamin
C, flavonoids, and polyphenols have ring structures. They
all share one structural commonality: conjugated systems,
characterized by intermittent single bonds and double bonds
which together form aligned p orbitals where pi electrons
canmove freely.The conjugated system can, therefore, donate
electrons more easily and thus have high reducing capacity.
This property gives these phytoagents ROS buffering capacity
that protects important biomolecules from ROS attack.
(b) Attenuation of the Fenton(-Like) Reaction by Direct Metal
Ion Chelation. Oxidative damage is one of the main forms of
toxicity conferred by transition metal ions. In the Fenton(-
like) reaction, the reduced form of a transition metal ion
catalyzes the generation of the highly reactive hydroxyl free
radical from hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, the more free
form transition metal ions there are, the more hydroxyl
free radical formation occurs by the Fenton(-like) reaction,
and the more serious the oxidative damage to biomolecules
including DNA. Will be Phytoagents can attenuate Fenton(-
like) reaction by reducing the level of transition metal ion.
Through direct chelation by phytocompounds containing
a catechol or galloyl structure, transition metal ions are
sequestered from solution and therefore prevented from
participating the Fenton(-like) reaction [69, 70]. This is
another indirect way by which phytoagents exert antioxidant
effects.
(c) Induction of Antioxidant Response Element-Controlled
Genes through Nrf2 Activation.Dietary levels of phytochemi-
cals have been suggested to trigger induction of low levels of
oxidative stress that may ‚Äúprime‚Äù cellular antioxidant defense
systems to resist higher levels of oxidative insults thus offering
protection against carcinogenic insult [60]. These types of
phytochemicals might have little antioxidant effect in vitro
in terms of ROS scavenging capacity; nonetheless, in some
cases, they activate themaster transcription factorNrf2which
governs the expression of a set of antioxidant-related genes.
Therefore, through activation of Nrf2 and the subsequent up-
regulation of endogenous antioxidant defense, these phyto-
chemicals confer antioxidant effects in an indirect way.
Phytoagents from various structural categories have
been shown to activate Nrf2 with varied potency [71].
In general, phytoagents with electrophilic groups that are
thiol-reactive induce the most potent Nrf2 activation when
compared based on fold of induction of Nrf2-regulated

Figure 6: Representative phytocompoundswith redox regulation capability.There are fourmajor types of phytocompounds that canmodulate
intracellular redox status: (A) phenolics, (B) terpenes, (C) vitamins, and (D) organosulfides. They show free radical scavenging, Nrf2/ARE
activation, and/or facilitation of ROS production in cancer cells.
NADPH: quinone reductase [72]. Some phytoagents without
electrophilic groups could also induce Nrf2, though to a
lesser extent. These types of phytoagents might activate Nrf2
indirectly through modulating signaling pathways whereas
thiol-reactive electrophiles can directly modify the redox-
sensitive cysteine residues in theNrf2/Keap1 complex thereby
promoting the dissociation of the complex and the nuclear
translocation of Nrf2.
(d) Attenuation of Inflammation through Inactivation. NF-ùúÖB
is the master transcription factor that governs the expression
of many inflammation-related genes. Notably, the activation
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 9
of NF-ùúÖB is redox-sensitive. High endogenous ROS level
stimulates NF-ùúÖB activation, which then leads to a pro-
inflammatory response and further exacerbates the intracel-
lular redox status [73‚Äì77]. Such a feedback loop mediated
by redox-sensitive NF-ùúÖB activation often leads to chronic
inflammation, one of the hallmarks of cancer. Many phytoa-
gents exhibiting an anti-inflammatory effect have been shown
to efficiently suppress NF-ùúÖB activation. Suppression of NF-
ùúÖB can be achieved by either the aforementioned antioxidant
actions or through direct chemical modification of NF-
ùúÖB redox-sensitive cysteine residues by phytoagents with
electrophilic groups, such as C=O, N=C=S or organosulfide
groups to compromise its ability to translocate to the nucleus
and bind DNA.
3.2.2. Antioxidant Effects and Defense Systems of Selected Phy-
toagents. Vitamins and phenolics (two well-known groups
of antioxidants), as well as electrophilic phytocompounds,
are used below to exemplify the latest developments in the
evaluation of the antioxidant effects and related defense
systems of phytocompounds with a focus on oxidative DNA
damage as a biomarker in cancer prevention.
(a) Vitamins. The ability of macronutrients and micronutri-
ents present in fruits and vegetables to reduce the risk of can-
cer is well known. Among these compounds, the antioxidant
vitamins and their precursors have been extensively studied
[15]. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E, and ùõΩ-carotene
are often referred to as ‚Äúantioxidant vitamins.‚Äù Vitamin C
cooperates with vitamin E to generate ùõº-tocopherol from ùõº-
tocopherol radicals in membranes and lipoproteins.Through
working along with other antioxidant enzymes, these antiox-
idants have been suggested to reduce oxidative damage in
humans [78], and thereby minimizing the risk of certain
chronic diseases [79‚Äì81]. However, early epidemiological
studies and clinical trials investigating the efficacy of these
vitamins in affecting disease outcome concluded that there
was insufficient evidence to link supplementation of humans
with vitamin C, vitamin E, or ùõΩ-carotene with a reduction
in in vivo oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, or DNA
based on the measurement of oxidative biomarkers [82].
More recent clinical trials also suggest no correlatable effect
between individual vitamins and chemoprevention [83, 84].
Further, anticancer properties reported for different vitamins
have been discrepant. The history of the most well-known
antioxidant, vitamin C, in cancer treatment is controversial
while vitamins A and E only showed dispensable effects
in tumor elimination [85]. However, the role of vitamin
D in cancer treatment and prevention is promising [86,
87]. Interestingly, a large-scale, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial in male physicians showed that,
compared with placebo, men taking a daily multivitamin
had a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of
total cancer; however, there was no significant effect on some
specific cancer types, such as prostate cancer and colorectal
cancer. It was therefore concluded that ‚Äúdaily multivitamin
supplementation modestly but significantly reduced the risk
of total cancer [88].‚Äù
Recently, in a large cohort studywith 356 healthy subjects,
dietary intake of vitamins was demonstrated to be associated
with reduced levels ofmarkers of DNAdamage and oxidation
(M1dG and 8-oxoG) measured in peripheral white blood
cells. Notably, the associations were stronger in nonsmokers
than in smokers [89]. It is important to keep in mind
that several environmental factors can affect the antioxidant
capacity of these vitamins. Environmental factors such as
smoking and metal intoxication that causes excessive ROS
burden to the body should be avoided, because antioxidant
phytoagents can prevent de novo oxidation to nucleic acid
but are not able to rescue or reverse oxidized nucleic acid
caused by persistent oxidative insults from environmental
stimulation. In another study, the protective effects of vitamin
C and a natural phenol resveratrol on ethanol-induced oxida-
tive DNA damage in human peripheral lymphocytes were
investigated. Resveratrol showed significant DNA protection
in a 24 h experiment, while the protective effect of vitamin
C was seen in only 1 h. Both compounds were shown to
directly scavenge hydroxyl radicals produced during ethanol
metabolism. In addition, resveratrol inhibited dehydrogenase
gene expression and activated the base excision repair (BER)
system, mechanisms whichmay underlie its substantial effect
on DNA protection. Vitamin C, however, showed no effect
on the ethanol metabolic pathway or the BER system [90].
The antioxidant properties of vitamins in comparison to
whole fruits and vegetables as anticancer agents are also of
interest. The effectiveness of kiwifruit in decreasing oxidative
DNA damage was assessed using comet assay (single-cell gel
electrophoresis) tomeasure damage to lymphocytes collected
from a human trial in which subjects drank kiwifruit juice.
It was observed that a simple extract of kiwifruit was more
effective than a solution of vitamin C in protecting DNA
from damage in vitro [91]. This study demonstrated that the
significant antioxidant activity of kiwifruit ex vivo and in vitro
is not attributable entirely to vitamin C contained in the fruit.
Instead, other components like phenolics and vitamin E may
also contribute to the antioxidant effect of kiwi fruit extract
[92]. These studies suggest an undetermined role of vitamin
C present in fresh fruits, although different vitamin C content
present in kiwifruit extractmight result in different protective
effects.
(b) Phenolics. Phenolic compounds are present in high con-
centrations in many components of the so-called ‚ÄúMediter-
ranean diet,‚Äù including fruit and vegetables. These com-
pounds seem to scavenge ROS, resulting in protection against
oxidative DNA. This assumption was verified by testing the
effect of Mediterranean plant extracts (Crepis vesicaria L,
Origanumheracleoticum, Scandix australis L,Amaranthus sp.,
Scolymus hispanicus L, and Thymus piperella L) on oxidative
DNA damage induced in lymphocytes by H
2
O
2
in relation to
their polyphenolic content using comet assay [93].This study
revealed that the protection of DNA by phenols present in
Mediterranean plants is only partly due to ROS scavenging
properties. Phenols can also attenuate Fenton(-like) reac-
tions through metal ion chelation and induce endogenous
antioxidant defense through Nrf2 activation. Apparently,
ROS scavenging only partially contributes to antioxidant
10 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
activity of Mediterranean diet-derived phenolics or other
phytochemicals. Their protection against oxidative DNA
may involve other redox regulation such as upregulation of
antioxidant enzymes in cells and attenuation of Fenton(-like)
reaction by metal ion chelation.
In the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
oxidative stress is a major predisposing condition which is
relevant to the development and progression of the cancer.
In search for a dietary chemopreventive approach for the
lethal HCC, pomegranate, an ancient fruit has gained atten-
tion owing to its significant antioxidant properties mainly
contributed by the anthocyanins and ellagic acid derivatives
[94, 95]. Pomegranate emulsion, a proprietary combination
of aqueous phase extract and pomegranate seed oil contain-
ing several polyphenolic compounds, mixed with octadeca-
trienoic acids, sterols, steroids, and ùõæ-tocopherol, was found
to prevent hepatocarcinogenesis through induction of Nrf2-
regulated phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing genes such as
several GST isozymes that are involved in antagonizing
oxidative stress [96]. A similar Nrf2-mediated antioxidant
effect was also observed in HCC rats treated with blackcur-
rant anthocyanins [97].
Flavonoids are naturally occurring diphenylpropanoids
that appear in animal and human cells following consump-
tion of vegetables, fruits, and beverages such as tea and
wine. Flavonoids can be classified into six major subgroups:
flavonols (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol), flavones (e.g., api-
genin, luteolin), flavanones (e.g., hesperidin, naringenin),
flavan-3-ols (e.g., catechin, theaflavin, and gallic esters of
catechin and theaflavins), anthocyanidins (e.g., pelargonidin,
cyanidin), and isoflavones (e.g., genistein, daidzein). Epi-
demiological studies suggest that dietary intake of flavonoids
may reduce the risk of tumors of the breast, colon, lung,
prostate, and pancreas. However, the generalizability of these
anticancer effects remains a subject of study [98].
(c) Electrophilic Phytochemicals. Electrophilic phytochemi-
cals, such as phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC), sulforaphane
(SFN), turmeric, curcumin, and EGCG, prevent oxidative
modification and mutation of genes through activation of
the Nrf2/Keap1 complex [45, 99‚Äì101]. These phytochemicals
modulate Keap1-associated transcriptional regulation which
results in up-regulation of ARE-bearing genes encoding
phase II detoxifying enzymes and transporters that protect
normal cells from ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS)
or reactive metabolites of carcinogenic species [71]. Such
responses are thought to represent a form of cellular adapta-
tion to chemicals and oxidative stress that maintains cellular
redox homeostasis [15, 99]. Therefore, the use of dietary phy-
tochemicals to regulateNrf2-dependent antioxidant response
to counter oxidative DNA damage has emerged as a promis-
ing strategy for cancer prevention.
Hormonal factors, especially 17√ü-estradiol (E2), play a
major role in the etiology of breast cancer where the cir-
culating levels of E2 itself are an independent risk factor.
E2 can cause both oxidative DNA damage and attenuate
DNA repair leading to oncogenic mutagenesis [102]. In the
liver, the metabolism of E2 to its various phase I metabo-
lites, such as the carcinogenic 4-hydroxy estradiol (4E2),
primarily involves the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2
and CYP3A4 [103]. Dietary berries and their chemical con-
stituents are known for their cancer preventive potential,
which were recently shown to affect the enzymes involved in
carcinogen metabolism in mouse liver [104] and significantly
reduced hepatic oxidative DNA damage, indicated by the
level of 8-oxoG and other polar adducts validated by P32-
postlabeling experiments. Compared to crude berry juices,
ellagic acid, one of the bioactive components found in berries,
showed more elimination of oxidative DNA adducts induced
by redox cycling of 4E2 catalyzed by copper chloride in vitro
[105].
3.3. Phytocompounds as Prooxidative Agents for Cancer Ther-
apy. Prooxidant phytoagents, on the other hand, are particu-
larly effective in treating aggressive tumors with abnormally
radical-reactive cellular environments. They act by tipping
the limit of oxidative stress that can be tolerated by tumor
cells over a limit, thus triggering apoptosis and cell death
[106]. Although pro-oxidant effects are observed after treat-
ment with certain phytoagents, generally, phytoagents do
not produce ROS directly. Instead, their prooxidant effect
is highly dependent on the original redox status of the
cell which determines sensitivity to cytotoxicity mediated
by phytoagents. The basal redox levels of cancer cells are
different from those of normal cells. Higher levels of free form
metal ions and higher levels of endogenous ROS production
in cancer cells sensitizes them to phytoagent-mediated proox-
idant cytotoxicity [30, 107, 108]. In this section, we elaborate
on how phytoagents act as prooxidants to selectively kill
cancer cells and their effects in cancer chemotherapy.
3.3.1. Major Prooxidant Mechanisms of Action of Phytoagents
(a) Promotion of Fenton(-Like) Reactions byCatalyzing Redox-
Cycling of Metal Ions. Phytoagents with strong reducing
capacity can reduce not only ROS but also metal ions.
Under normal physiological conditions, most metal ions
are complexed with proteins and few exist in free form.
However, in the presence of abundant free form metal ions,
phytoagents catalyze Fenton(-like) reactions that produce
injurious hydroxyl radicals [29, 109]. Notably, cancer cells
develop abnormally high concentrations of metal ions due
to overexpression of the transferrin receptor [110, 111]. When
excessive concentrations of free form metal ions exist, clas-
sical antioxidant phytoagents catalyze the redox cycling of
metal ions by reducing their oxidized form. As a result, a
burst of hydroxyl free radical production ensues and the
phytoagents become pro-oxidants.
(b) Basal ROS Generation through Glutathione Depletion by
Electrophiles. Phytoagents with electrophilic groups can form
covalent bonds with cysteine resides of proteins. Glutathione,
the most abundant cysteine-containing peptide, thus can
be rapidly depleted due to adduct formation with elec-
trophilic phytoagents [112‚Äì115]. Upon glutathione depletion,
the buffering capacity of ROS is attenuated so that the
basal ROS production is revealed. Therefore, electrophilic
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 11
phytoagents exhibit pronounced pro-oxidant effect in cancer
cells with high ROS production and push cancer cells over
the tolerable limit of ROS. In contrast, the same dosage
of phytoagents produces a negligible pro-oxidant effect in
normal cells with low basal ROS production and boosts
antioxidant response by Nrf2 activation [71, 100, 116‚Äì121].
3.3.2. Prooxidant Effects and Defense Systems of Selected
Phytoagents. ROS and cellular oxidative stress have long
been associated with cancer [122]. Hypoxic condition, that
is, low ambient oxygen pressure, is well described in cancer
cells, particularly in the central area of the tumor nodule
or mass [123]. These cancer cells act more like anaerobic
bacteria, showing low levels of mitochondrial oxidative phos-
phorylation, and generally survive through the generation of
ATP in an oxygen-independent manner [124]. Many conven-
tional anticancer drugs including vinblastine, doxorubicin,
campthotecin, cisplatin, and inostamycin have been reported
to activate a caspase-3(-like) protease causing generation of
H
2
O
2
presumably through the activation of NADPH oxidase
that subsequently induces apoptosis in cancer cells [125].
Intriguingly, cancer cells are frequently deficient in crucial
antioxidative enzymes, such as catalase, GPx, and SOD, and
therefore demonstrate a high vulnerability to ROS. One
antitumor strategy is to deliver excess oxidative stress into
tumor cells or to target the disruption of the antioxidative
defense systems of tumor cells.This strategy has been termed
‚Äúoxidation therapy‚Äù in cancer treatment [126]. Several studies
have reported that certain dietary anticancer/cancer preven-
tive agents cause generation of ROS specifically in tumor cells,
not in normal cells [56, 127, 128].Through adaptation, normal
cells that are exposed to pro-oxidant chemopreventive agents
which generate oxidative stress can acquire resistance to
transformation via adjusting the normal redox tone of these
cells. In contrast, transformed cells, which typically endure
an oxidizing intracellular environment, would ultimately
succumb due to an excess of ROS caused by the same agent.
ROS and cellular redox tone are exploitable targets in cancer
chemoprevention via the stimulation of cytoprotection in
normal cells and/or the induction of apoptosis in malignant
cells [129]. Dietary intake of such chemopreventive agents
could be a prefect strategy to achieve this purpose.
(a) Sulfur-Containing Compounds. Diallyl disulfide (DADS)
and diallyltrisulfide (DATS) which are found in abun-
dance in garlic are among the dietary factors studied
extensively for their anticancer action involving induction
of oxidative stress in the human body, as reviewed else-
where [130]. The pro-oxidant and thiol-adducting activ-
ities of these electrophilic organosulfur compounds are
attributed to their reactive isothiocyanate (R‚ÄìN=C=S) phar-
macophore. Dietary isothiocyanates include sulforaphane,
phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), benzyl-isothiocyanate,
and 6-methylsulfinylhexyl-isothiocyanate (Figure 6). Origi-
nally, copper-mediated oxidative DNA damage induced by
these isothiocyanates was considered to be carcinogenic [131];
however, later studies demonstrated that these phytochem-
icals exhibit preferential cytostaticity in premalignant and
tumor cells via their pleiotropic pro-oxidant activities as
reviewed elsewhere [106].
(b) Curcumin. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) from turmeric,
like isothiocyanates, is a pleiotropic redox modulator that is
involved in multiple cellular activities as a pro/antioxidant
and metal chelator, as recently reviewed [59]. Curcumin,
which contains an electrophilic Michael acceptor as an active
moiety, can also mediate strand scission of DNA in the
presence of Cu (II) [132].The compelling anticancer activities
of curcumin have been widely demonstrated across different
cancer cell lines and animal systems, as a function of above-
mentioned reactive pharmacophores targeting various cellu-
lar molecules. Currently, the cancer preventive/therapeutic
potential of curcumin, as single or combinatorial agent, is
under evaluation in various clinical trials, including multiple
myeloma, rectal cancer, metastatic colon cancer, advanced
osteosarcoma, and pancreatic cancer [59].
(c) Sesquiterpene Lactones. The sesquiterpene lactones (SLs)
have also gained considerable attention for their effective-
ness in treating inflammation, headaches, infections, and
other human diseases. SLs contain Michael acceptors that
act as electrophiles that can increase cellular ROS and
modulate specific redox sensitive targets in cancer cells.
Artemisinin and parthenolide (Figure 6) are SL-derived
drugs now being evaluated in cancer clinical trials [133‚Äì
138]. Artemisinin, isolated from Artemisia annua (qinhao,
sweet wormwood), possesses an endoperoxide bridge in the
reactive pharmacophore that can be activated and cleaved
by endogenous ions, leading to the generation of radical
species and ROS through the Fenton reaction, which was
observed to be a common mechanism underlying both the
antimalarial and anticancer activities of the compound [139].
Parthenolide, identified from feverfew (Tanacetum parthe-
nium), contains an electrophilic ùõº-methylene-ùõæ-lactone as
the active moiety underlying its anticancer activity related to
the Michael acceptor electrophile [66, 67]. Phytochemicals
with prooxidant properties such as the SLs with Michael
acceptor electrophiles have the potential to sensitize tumors
in cancer treatment. For example, concurrent delivery of
the SL parthenolide and the clinical drug paclitaxel in
mixed micelles greatly improved the therapeutic response of
resistant lung cancer cell lines to paclitaxel treatment [140]. In
a mouse peritoneal dissemination model, parthenolide also
improved the chemosensitivity of paclitaxel against gastric
cancer through deregulation of theNF-ùúÖB signalling pathway
[141]. Nevertheless, parthenolide and dehydrocostus lactone
can also suppress cancer cell activity through downregulating
other molecular targets, such as mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C, and induction of c-Jun-
N-termial kinase (JNK) [142].
In our laboratory, we identified a germacranolide SL
deoxyelephantopin (DET) from a medicinal plant Elephan-
topus scaber (Asteraceas) which contains an ùõº-methylene-ùõæ-
lactone, an ùõº,ùõΩ-unsaturated lactone and a methacrylate ester
side chain [62]. DET could induce ROS in breast cancer
cells which became the upstream stimulus for the formation
of centrosomal ubiquitinated protein aggregates and the
12 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
induction of protein carbonylation that might subsequently
restrict cancer cell motility [63]. DET was also observed to
activate ER stress- and JNK pathway-mediated apoptosis in
mammary carcinoma cells triggered by ROS [62]. However,
it is not yet clear whether DET caused oxidative DNAdamage
through the involvement of transitionmetals. Illustration that
the anticancer activity of DET, the same as artemisinin, is
through its role as a pro-oxidant suggests that pro-oxidant
intervention using SLsmay constitute a promising anticancer
strategy.
3.4. Cancer-Associated Transition Metals in Phytochemical-
Mediated Redox Regulation. Several essential transition met-
als, such as zinc, iron, copper, cobalt, and manganese, are
known to regulate various metabolic and signaling path-
ways. For example, iron is an essential element in oxygen
transportation [143] while copper is an essential component
of several antioxidant enzymes [144]. In cancer cells, high
metal ion concentration is one factor that contributes to the
observed high base level of oxidative stress, which raises
the possibility of killing cancer cells by dosing with metal
supplements [145]. However, the prooxidant effect of metal
ions is also known to initiate carcinogenesis [30], which
raises concerns about applying metal supplementation as a
therapeutic strategy against cancer. However, some studies
indicated that cancer cells are prone to proliferate in envi-
ronments with high levels of copper and iron and therefore
suggested that these ions maybe be functionally involved in
carcinogenesis [146, 147]. In a national cohort of the United
States adults, serum concentrations of iron and copper were
shown to correlate with mortality rate in cancer patients
[148]. Due to the significant role of these metal ions in cancer
epidemiology, their levels in different cancers were reviewed
by Gupte and Mumper [145]. In comparison to normal
individuals, the Cu (Zn, Se, Fe) ratios are usually higher in
patients suffering from breast [149], cervical [150], ovarian
[150], lung [151], prostate [152], bladder [153], and stomach
cancer [154], and leukemia [155]. Increased levels of copper
have also recently been correlated with poor survival in
breast cancer patients [156].Themajormetal ion contained in
chromatin, copper is closely associated with the DNA bases,
especially guanine [157]. As one of the redox active metals,
copper can directly catalyze the formation of ROS via the
Fenton reaction and cause oxidative stress in the cells [158].
The intracellular level of transition metal ions can determine
whether phytoantioxidants act as cytoprotective antioxidants
or cytotoxic prooxidants. Figure 7 summarizes the current
understanding of the interplay between phytoagents and
transition metal ions and the antioxidant/pro-oxidant role
switch of phytoagents in response to the level of metal ions.
The level of transition metal ions determines whether a
phytoagent ultimately functions as cytoprotective antioxidant
or cytotoxic pro-oxidant. Under normal level of transition
metal ions, phytoantioxidants serve as radical scavengers
and Nrf2/ARE activators that confer a cytoprotective effect
that can be applied in chemoprevention. When the level of
intracellular transition metal ion is high, such as in cancer
cells, phytoagents recycle the metal ions and thus facilitate
ROS production through the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions.
Otherwise, metal ions catalyze the cleavage of phytoagents
and generate radical cleavage products that can cause ROS.
Such a prooxidant effect further drives the redox-sensitive
cancer cells to their antioxidant limit and leads to cytotoxicity
that can be applied as a chemotherapeutic strategy. On
the other hand, metal-chelating phytoagents reduce metal
ion levels and thus block the ROS producing Fenton(-like)
reaction and provide a cytoprotective effect.
3.4.1. Ion Chelation by Phytoagents. Increasing numbers of
studies are evaluating the antioxidant properties of phyto-
chemicals through assessment of their ability to chelate metal
ions that lead to attenuated reactivity of free radicals. Water
extracts of pine needles inhibited oxidative DNA damage
probably due to their stronghydroxyl radical and intracellular
ROS scavenging activity and the chelating action of the
iron (Fe2+) ion [159]. Antioxidant activity was reported for
lunasin, a novel preventive peptide purified from Solanum
nigrum L, which is also found in soy, barley, and wheat.
The peptide did not scavenge endogenous hydroxyl radicals
but inhibited the Fenton reaction by chelating iron ions,
thus protecting DNA from oxidative damage [160]. The
antioxidant properties of phenolic compounds are clear;
however, the contribution of metal ion chelation to the
antioxidative effect of these compounds is not yet conclusive.
One study showed that the orthodihydroxy polyphenols bear-
ing catechol or galloyl groups exhibit strong metal chelating
activity [161]. In the study by Andjelkovic and colleagues, the
ability of the phenolic compounds which chelate iron was
ranked based on iron binding constants in ascending order.
Protocatechuic acid was the weakest chelator, followed by
hydroxytyrosol, gallic acid, and caffeic acid, with chlorogenic
acid as the strongest chelator [162]. Iron chelation by phenolic
compounds, phytochemicals in pine needle extracts, or by
the peptide lunasin, which subsequently inhibited DNA
oxidation, may deserve further exploration for their potential
in cancer prevention.
The reactivity of metal ions can be attenuated indi-
rectly through inhibition of their transportation. Dihy-
droartemisinin was reported to decrease iron uptake and
disturb iron homeostasis in cancer cells through down
regulating cell-surface transferrin receptor-1, which may be
a novel mechanism of dihydroartemisinin independent of
oxidative damage that has been previously mentioned as
anticancer property of artemisinin [163]. The disturbance
of iron homeostasis in cancer cells via irondepletion by
natural or synthetic iron chelators has recently been shown
to inhibit tumor growth by therapeutically manipulating iron
level [164]. The effect of phytocompounds on deregulation
of reactive ion metabolism in tumor cells is worth further
exploration.
It is interesting to note that a prokaryotic glutathione
analog, namely, ergothioneine, can protect cells from oxida-
tive damage as measured by 4-HNE and partially rescue cell
death caused by irradiation [165]. Another report showed that
ergothioneine forms a chelation complex with copper and
therefore protects cells from copper-induced DNA damage
[166].

Figure 7: Role switches under different conditions‚Äîphytoagents function as both antioxidants and prooxidants in concert with transition
metal ions. The level of transition metal ions determines whether a phyto-antioxidant ultimately functions as cytoprotective antioxidant or
cytotoxic prooxidant. Under normal levels of transition metal ions, phytoantioxidants serve as radical scavengers and Nrf2/ARE activators
that confer a cytoprotective effect that can be applied in chemoprevention. When the level of intracellular transition metal ion is high, such
as in cancer cells, phytoantioxidants recycle the metal ions and thus facilitate ROS production through the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions.
Otherwise,metal ions catalyze the cleavage of phytoagents and generate radical cleavage products that can cause ROS. Such a prooxidant effect
further drives the redox-sensitive cancer cells to their antioxidant limit and leads to cytotoxicity that can be applied as a chemotherapeutic
strategy. On the other hand, metal-chelating phytoagents reduce metal ion levels and thus block the ROS producing Fenton(-like) reaction
and provide a cytoprotective effect.
3.4.2. Transition Metal-Mediated Prooxidant Properties of
Phytochemicals in Anticancer Activity. Under certaincon-
ditions, antioxidants can act as prooxidants [167]. Caffeic
acid produces hydrogen peroxide which is activated by
transition metals to cause oxidative DNA damage in vitro
and in cultured human cells in the presence of Mn(II)
or Cu(II) [168]. In another study using DNA fragments
isolated from the human p53 gene, quercetin increased
8-oxoG levelsignificantly in the presence of copper ions
(Cu2+), whereas 8-oxoG formation by kaempferol or luteolin
was insignificant [169]. These early studies raised concern
about whether ingestion of these phytochemicals may lead
to increased risk of cancer. Lately, rats treated with 7,12-
dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) have become a widely
usedmodel formammary carcinogenesis and in recent study,
dietary supplementation with copper alone or together with
the grape polyphenol resveratrol was found to promote
carcinogenesis through increased frequency of microsatellite
instability [170]. Later, a similar result was observed in the
DMBA-model treated with combined supplementation with
zinc ions and resveratrol [171]. However, a different mecha-
nism was reported for resveratrol action in another cancer
model with different stage of carcinogenesis. Resveratrol
and its derivatives increase copper-mediated oxidative DNA
damage by their pro-oxidant properties coupled with higher
apoptosis induction in human leukemia cell lines [172].
The well-known antioxidant vitamin C, for example, was
also found to act as a pro-oxidant in vitro when mixed with
transition metal ions [173]. In healthy humans, Rehman and
colleagues observed an increased level of oxidative DNA
damage after 6-week supplementation of a mixture of ferrous
sulphate andvitamin C, suggesting that this combination
acts as a pro-oxidant; however, a longer period of sup-
plementation by 12 weeks did not show significant effect
[174]. Intriguingly, catalytic therapy that involves hydroxyl
radical induction through a redox active mixture of vitamin
C/medicinal herbal extracts and copper has been employed
to improve the treatment of cancer patients [175, 176]. The
Bhat group that established a model that involves human
peripheral lymphocytes and comet assay carried out a series
of studies on plant-derived polyphenolic antioxidants and
proved that the mechanism is not restricted to vitamin C
[177‚Äì179]. The most recent finding from the group is that the
polyphenolic compound gossypol from the cotton plant and
its derivative apogossypolone also cause oxidative damage
to DNA by mobilizing endogenous copper in lymphocytes
[180]. Although the reported mechanism was mainly the

Figure 8: Summary of mechanisms of action of phytoagents in chemoprevention and chemotherapeutics through modulating oxidative
stress. In the presence of ferrous ions (or other transition metal ions), phytoagents recycle the metal ion and thus promote the Fenton
reaction that generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide. Such prooxidant effects of phytoagents in the presence
of metal ion can overwrite their cytoprotective roles because the production of ROS may be faster than the induction of antioxidant defense.
Hydrogen peroxide imposes oxidative damage on biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and DNA, and leads to protein carbonylation, lipid
peroxidation, and DNA base oxidation, which can be prevented by phytoantioxidants. Phytoantioxidants can activate Nrf2/ARE signaling
and thus transcriptionally upregulate a panel of antioxidant genes that can provide further antioxidant capacity. Glutathione synthetase (GSS)
can raise the level of glutathione (GSH) which can reduce oxidative damage by scavenging hydroxyl radicals, which otherwise cause oxidative
DNA damage and increase the chance of point mutation and genome instability during the DNA repair process while glutathione reductase
(GR) recycles the oxidized form of GSH and maintains the level of the reduced form of GSH. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxin
(TRX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX) can prevent oxidative insults on proteins and lipids.
imply the anticancer property of polyphenols based on
the abundant copper detected in different types of tumors
[145, 153]. The enhanced electron transfer between transi-
tion metals and phytochemicals probably occurs in cancer
cells with higher levels of copper ions, which may induce
ROS generation subsequently leading to DNA damage [178,
180].
However, the mixture of a polyphenol and a transition
metal was shown to promote tumor growth in mice with
carcinogen induction that mimics the process of cancer
initiation [170, 171]. These studies raise concerns about the
potential carcinogenic activities of phytoagents. It is not
clear whether the mixture of antioxidant phytochemical and
transition metal resembles the oxidative stress that could
possibly initiate tumorigenesis in normal cells, but that such
a prooxidant effect drives the redox-sensitive cancer cells
to their antioxidant limit and leads to cytotoxicity that has
been applied in catalytic therapy.More studies are required to
clarify the interaction of phytoagents and redox active metals
as their oxidative potential may initiate tumors in a healthy
individual.
4. Future Prospects
This review provides updated and integrative information
about the regulation of nucleic acid oxidation by phytoagents
in cancer. Animalmodels and human epidemiological studies
have revealed that phytochemicals prevent carcinogenesis
through direct ROS scavenging or induction of cellular
antioxidant defense systems that consist of detoxifying
enzymes, defense machinery mediated by Nrf2-antioxidative
stress, and inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways that
together protect cells fromDNAdamage by ROS and reactive
metabolites of carcinogens [42, 57, 58] (Figure 8). Inves-
tigation of oxidative modulation of proteins and lipids as
well as DNA by phytochemicals provides a comprehensive
picture of their functions as redox regulators in cancer. In
general, antioxidant phytoagents are potentially useful in
cancer prevention because they can protect healthy cells from
oxidative DNA damage through radical scavenging, antiox-
idant defense system stimulation, and metal ion chelation;
prooxidant phytoagents, on the other hand, are particu-
larly effective in treating aggressive tumors with abnormally
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 15
radical-reactive cellular environments by exceeding the limit
of oxidative stress that can be tolerated by tumor cells. Cancer
cells, in general, have a higher basal redox level due to either
defects in antioxidant defense or increased production of
ROS during oncogenic transformation [122, 126]. Therefore,
when challenged with similar quantities of ROS, cancer cells
fail to buffer/clear excessive ROS and cell death ensues. In
contrast, normal cells with lower redox levels are capable
of buffering/clearing ROS by inducible antioxidant defense
regulated by Nrf2/ARE signaling and are thus protected from
cell death. Recently, dietary levels of phytochemicals have
been suggested to trigger induction of low levels of oxidative
stress that may ‚Äúprime‚Äù cellular antioxidant defense systems
to resist higher level of oxidative insults, thus offering greater
protection against carcinogenic insult [60].
However, several studies have also hinted at a ‚Äúdark‚Äù
side of these cell-protective mechanisms. For example, the
cytotoxicity of the anticancer drug platinum was attenuated
by base excision repair of ROS-induced formation of 8-oxoG,
indicating that repairing genotoxic damage could contribute
to multidrug resistance of cancer cells [181]. Restoration of
glutathione level by overexpression of ùõæ-glutamylcysteine
synthetase was found to prevent DNA damage and subse-
quent apoptosis caused by genotoxic agents in a resistant
human ovarian carcinoma cell line [182]. Overexpression of
catalase was found to cause drug resistance in breast cancer
cell lines in chemotherapy [183]. These findings imply that
alteration of the expression of antioxidant enzymes could be
a mechanism through which cancer-cell resistance to redox-
based chemotherapeutic agents is promoted. On the other
hand, several phytochemicals have been indicated to upreg-
ulate the Nrf2 pathway which stimulates the defense system
and leads to cancer prevention. However, overexpression of
Nrf2 and its downstream genes was also observed in several
cancer cell lines and human tumors, rendering cancer cells
at an advantage for survival and unlimited proliferation. In
addition, increased Nrf2 activity was found in some resistant
cancer cells; in other words, to overcome chemoresistance in
tumors, the Nrf2 pathway has to be deregulated [184]. There-
fore, sophisticated design is necessary and caution has to be
taken when administrating and handling Nrf2-dependent (as
discussed above) phytochemicals in cancer patients, given
that transformed cancer cells that are ‚Äúoverprotected‚Äù by
antioxidants could possibly develop drug resistance.
Nrf2 is one of the key players in phytoagent-mediated
antioxidant defensewhose activation confers a chemopreven-
tive effect. However, recent studies indicate that Nrf2 itself
also plays a double-bladed-sword role in cancer manage-
ment [185]. On one hand, Nrf2 orchestrates gene expression
that protects cells from oxidative damage and detoxifies
xenobiotics; on the other hand, the same effects confer
chemoresistance to cancer cells. It is important to discern
when and how tomanipulate Nrf2 and so we canmake use of
its advantages while minimizing potential disadvantages.The
major negative sides of Nrf2 activation include promoting
bioactivation of xenobiotics whose glucuronide conjugation
form is genotoxic and forms adducts with DNA [186‚Äì188],
neutralizing the chemotherapeutic effects in which oxidative
stress plays a significant role in mediating cytotoxicity to
cancer cells, and facilitating drug excretion from cell through
increasing the expression levels ofmultidrug resistant pumps.
Thereby, to minimize potential disadvantages, the use of
phytoagents as Nrf2 activators for chemoprevention should
carefully avoid coadministration of drugs that are bioacti-
vated by Nrf2-regulated phase II enzyme processing. On
the other hand, for pro-oxidant cancer chemotherapy, Nrf2
activation is deemed as a side-effect and should be suppressed
by coadministration of Nrf2 inhibitor [185]. Still, more future
studies are required to confirm these points and thus provide
a more accurate prediction, and therefore application, of
phytoagents in cancer management.
For phytochemicals that function as both antioxidants
and prooxidants, further characterization of the factors that
determine the transition from antioxidative to prooxidative
effects in the biosystem is essential. One contributing factor
is the presence of transition metals. In addition, the doses of
phytochemicals used in each treatment at different timesmay
be crucial. In this regard, we propose some considerations
on context-dependent, dual function of phytoagents thatmay
help to understand and to predict the chemotherapeutic role
of phytoagents. By comparing normal and cancer-bearing
individuals, we know that the oxidative DNAmarker 8-oxoG
correlates well with basal redox level [8, 189]. Cancer cells
with higher basal redox level demonstrated elevated levels of
8-oxoG, whereas normal cells had lower levels of basal redox
level and 8-oxoG. The overexpression of transferrin receptor
in cancer cells increased intracellular level of ferrous ions
and, presumably, increased the rate of the Fenton reaction.
It can be assumed that high levels of ferrous ions in cancer
cells switch the functions of phyto-antioxidants to those of
pro-oxidants resulting in further elevation of ROS level in
cancer cells but not in normal cells, and the selective killing of
cancer cells. More studies are required to determine the con-
centration threshold of metal ions that switche phytoagents
to their prooxidant roles, so that potential chemotherapeutic
applications can be better characterized. In summary, two
main points form the base of the concept of the context-
dependent dual role of phytoagents. One is the level of
intracellular level of transition metal ions and the other is
the basal redox level. The higher the two, the more likely
the agent to produce a pro-oxidant effect, whereas the lower
the two, the more likely the agent to produce an antioxidant
effect.
Continued rigorous research to identifymolecular targets
and conduct human studies with bioactive phytochemicals
are important to provide potential alternatives or novel
approaches for plant-based cancer prevention or therapy. It is
likely that the anticancer properties of phytochemicals result
frommodulation of a number of molecular mechanisms that
regulate different stages of carcinogenesis. In this regard,
increased antioxidant strength may be important prior to
dysregulation of signaling pathways during tumorigenesis,
whereas prooxidant cytotoxicity may be critical in eliminat-
ing transformed tumor cells that exhibit dysregulated redox
balance and metal ion absorption. In conclusion, careful
dose-response and stage-dependent studies that compare
enhancement of antioxidant capacity and induction of oxida-
tive stress by phytochemicals are essential to clarify when
16 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
and to what extent these phytoagents can be used in cancer
prevention or therapy.
