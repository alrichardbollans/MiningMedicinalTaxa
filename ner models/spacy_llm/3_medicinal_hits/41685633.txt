Abstract Minerals and heavy metal concentrations of 23
plants (arial parts, leaves, bark, stem, root, rhizome, dried
berries, seeds) possessing health-promoting effects and
used in indigenous medicines (as medicinal food) were
determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic
spectrometry. Vital essential minerals and heavy metals
were present in all the samples analyzed. The majority of
the plant materials were rich in some of the essential
minerals like Na, K, Ca, Fe, Mg, Cu, Mn, and Zn, which
are known to be beneficial for health. The plant material of
Vitiveria zizinalis had highest concentration of toxic heavy
metals, including arsenic (53.1 mg/100 g), chromium
(6.74 mg/100 g), cobalt (10.2 mg/100 g), mercury
(3.6 mg/100 g), and nickel (3.28 mg/100 g). Results of
the present study provide vital data on the availability of
some essential minerals, which can be useful to provide
dietary information for designing value-added foods and for
food biofortification. Apart from this, data on the contam-
inant levels of heavy metals highlights the necessity on the
quality and safety concerns about their use.

Introduction
Plants and their products have always played a substantial
role in human welfare by satisfying various essential needs
ranging from food to medicines. Currently, functional foods
or the nutraceuticals of plant origin have gained in
popularity and constitute a major share of the health care
market (Bhat and Sridhar 2008; Bhat and Karim 2009).
Today, consumers are quite practical and choosy in their
approach to diet; they are interested in incorporating high
nutrient levels with adequate amount of essential minerals
into their normal diet, preferably with sources from plant
origin. The expansion of the mineral supplement industry is
a direct indication of the gaining importance of minerals to
consumers. In this regard, interest has grown in finding
traditionally consumed plant products (e.g. herbs, spices)
that might not only have culinary and medicinal properties
but that also are abundant in essential micronutrients. Most
of the minerals, even at threshold levels, contribute
significantly to normal growth and play a pivotal role in
biochemical functions and essential enzyme systems.
Plant products play a significant role in traditional
medicine systems, and the majority of consumers have the
misconception that these products are inherently safe for
consumption. However, there is concern among researchers
that plants might accumulate heavy metals at significantly
high levels when grown in polluted soil (Kalǎc and
Svoboda 2000). If true, this will reflect the failure of good
agricultural and manufacturing practices and quality assur-
ance. Purity issues of plant-based drugs are also of high
concern (Mazzanti et al. 2008). Hence, studying the

presence of unwanted heavy metals and their concentrations
in plant species used as traditional medicines and recom-
mended to be incorporated in the normal food is a
necessity.
Of late, numerous efforts have been made to determine
the mineral and heavy metal contents of herbal, medicinal,
and aromatic plants, vegetables, and even wines from
various parts of the world (Aberoumand and Deokule 2009;
Galgano et al. 2008; Lavilla et al. 1999; Miller-Cebert et al.
2009; Tuzen et al. 2007). Trace elements and heavy metals
have certain health benefits at lower concentrations, but at
higher levels, they can be toxic and pose health risks
(Schumacher et al. 1991); thus, it is important to determine
the levels of these compounds in common, popular, and
widely used herbal plants (or as medicinal foods).
Detection of mineral and heavy metal concentrations in
various foods has been conducted mainly using atomic
absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) with flame atomiza-
tion and a graphite furnace. However, other alternative,
more reliable, and accurate methods are available, such as:
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, neutron
activation analysis, and X-ray fluorescence methods
(Knapp 1991). In this study, inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used as this
is a multi-element technique which allows fast and accurate
analysis of nearly 75 elements of the periodic table.
The major objective of this study was to evaluate and
provide baseline information on the mineral composition
and heavy metal contents of some popular and commer-
cially valuable plants from the Indian market that possess
high nutraceutical value. If at least a few of the plants were
found to have high mineral contents, they might have the
potential to be used for biofortification and development of
new food products.
Materials and Methods
Sample Collection and Identification
Certain common and popular plant materials that have
therapeutic and nutraceutical value and are used in
indigenous ayurvedic medicines were purchased from a
leading local market dealer (from Mysore, India). The
samples purchased were freshly harvested ones (less than
2 weeks) with no apparent physical damage. The materials
(a total of 23 plants consisting of arial parts, leaves, bark,
stem, root, rhizome, dried berries, seeds) were air dried at
room temperature (25±1°C) and ground into fine powder
in a mortar and pestle to avoid chromium contamination
from stainless steel utensils. The powder was placed
temporarily in air-tight polyethylene pouches until further
analysis. The identity of the plant material was confirmed
with assistance from local practitioners and botanists.
Table 1 lists the common name, scientific name, family,
parts used, and the medicinal/health-promoting effects of
the plant materials used in this study.
Preparation and Analysis
The minerals and heavy metal [aluminum (Al), arsenic
(As), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), chromium
(Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb),
magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo),
mercury (Hg), potassium (K), sodium (Na), nickel (Ni), and
zinc (Zn)] contents of the powdered samples were deter-
mined using the AOAC (1990) method. Briefly, a known
amount of the sample was digested with a mixture of
concentrated nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and perchloric acid
(10:0.5:2, v/v), and the analysis was conducted using the
ICP-OES (Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, USA). Table 2
lists the conditions and parameters used. All the glassware
were cleaned by soaking overnight in a 10% nitric acid
solution and then rinsing three times with deionized water.
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of minerals and heavy metals were performed in
replicates, and data are presented as mean±SD (n=3) with
one-way analysis of variance (significance level at P<0.05)
was performed with statistical software (ORIGIN®, version
6.0, Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA).
Results and Discussion
Table 3 depicts the mineral and heavy metal concentrations
of the samples analyzed in this study. Values varied widely
among samples, but in general, most samples were rich in
the following essential minerals: Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na,
and Zn. These minerals serve as structural components of
tissues, function in cellular and basal metabolism, and help
maintain water and acid–base balance (Smith 1988). The
abundances of K, Mg, and Ca agree with earlier data from
many of the plant specimens (Lavilla et al. 1999).
Artemisia vulgaris had the highest levels of Ca
(3,441.8 mg/100 g), whereas Annona squamosa had the
lowest (3.72 mg/100 g). Ca is a major component of bone,
assists in tooth development, helps regulate endo- and exo-
enzymes, and plays a significant role in regulating blood
pressure (Brody 1994). Using plant-based Ca as a nutri-
tional supplement might be advantageous for consumers
who are allergic to animal-based food sources or who
practice strict vegetarianism.
Cu was the highest in Berberis aristata (134.96 mg/100 g)
and lowest in Sida cordifolia (0.05 mg/100 g). Vitiveria

zizinalis had the highest concentrations of Fe and Zn (6,413.3
and 5.93 mg/100 g, respectively). Deficiency of zinc and iron
in the diet is a widespread problem and a matter of great
concern, especially in developing countries where people rely
more on vegetarian diets. These essential trace elements are
involved with vital immune system (Zn) and metabolic
functions and are intrinsic components of hemoglobin,
myoglobin, and cytochrome (Fe) (Hemalatha et al. 2007).
Hence, further study of V. zizinalis might prove this species to
be a useful dietary supplement to provide Zn and Fe,
especially for vegetarians.
Piper longum had the highest potassium content
(1,352.3 mg/100 g), Anethum sowa had the highest sodium
concentration (170.69 mg/100 g), and Rauvolfia serpentina
had the highest Mn concentration (856.4 mg/100 g). Perry
(1972) reported a correlation between therapeutic properties
of Cr and Mn in plants with diabetic and cardiovascular
diseases. Plant materials with high concentrations of the
above-mentioned micronutrient elements will definitely
play an important role in maintenance of human health
when taken at recommended levels.
Earlier research on humans and livestock has shown that
optimal intakes of elements such as Na, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu,
and Zn can reduce individual risk factors for health problems
such as cardiovascular disease (Mertz 1982; Sanchez-
Castillo et al. 1998). Mayer and Vyklicky (1989) reported
that these elements play a significant role in neurochemical
transmission and also serve as constituents of biological
molecules as a cofactor for various enzymes and in a variety
of different metabolic processes. Minerals like Fe, Zn, and
Mn are also recognized to be potential antioxidants (Talwar
et al. 1989), which are involved in strengthening the immune
system. Similarly, Mg, and Zn are known to prevent
cardiomyopathy, muscle degeneration, growth retardation,
alopecia, dermatitis, immunological dysfunction, gonadal
atrophy, impaired spermatogenesis, congenital malforma-
tions, and bleeding disorders (Chaturvedi et al. 2004).
Monitoring the presence and concentrations of heavy
metals in plants/herbs used for medicinal and health-
promoting effects is crucial because these levels can be
used as an indicator of the surrounding pollution and
because they can have ill effects when consumed directly.
According to Schilcher et al. (1987), the presence of toxic
metals in the environment is quite varied and depends on
various factors, such as pollution from industrial and traffic
emissions, the use of purification mud and agricultural
expedients such as Cd-containing dung and the use of
organic Hg fungicides and insecticides containing lead
arsenate.
In the present study, the heavy metals Al, Ba, Cd, and
Mo were not detectable, and lead was present but below
detection levels in all samples analyzed. In contrast, As, Co,
Cr, and Ni were detected in almost all samples, but they
were present in low concentrations (Table 3). The concen-
trations of As and Co were highest in V. zizinalis, (53.1 and
10.2 mg/100 g, respectively), and this was the only plant
material that was positive for the presence of Hg (3.6 mg/
100 g). Arsenic is considered to be one of the most toxic
elements, and the provisional tolerance (weekly intake) is

Food Anal. Methods (2010) 3:181–187 185
15 mg/kg body weight (FAO/WHO 1989). In an earlier
work, Liang et al. (1998) measured various metallic
elements in commercial Chinese medicines using AAS
and reported approximately 10 mg/100 g of arsenic in the
samples analyzed. However, the results on Hg (Table 3)
were contradictory to an earlier report by Dahanukar et al.
(1998) who found high levels of Hg (in six samples) that
exceeded the permissible amounts (1–7.5 ppm). Contami-
nation by Hg occurs mainly via its usage in dental
amalgam, electric switches, and batteries, which then finds
its way into soil. Hg poisoning causes inflammation of the
mouth, stomach, and colon and acute abdominal pain, and
it affects the kidneys.
Chromium is one of the trace metal nutrients that are
essential to humans and animals. Its principal role appears
to be in helping to maintain normal glucose tolerance in the
body (Strickland et al. 1972). Chromium was highest in V.
zizinalis (6.74 mg/100 g), followed by Bacopa monnieri
(2.88 mg/100 g), and it was lowest in Chlorophytum
borivilianum (0.08 mg/100 g). The main source of Cr
contamination occurs via the use of plating metal, as an
alloy of stainless steel, and in tanning of hides. Because Cr
is not known to have any toxic effects, no maximum intake
limit has been set. However, in the UK, the Committee on
Medical Aspects of Food Policy has recommended that Cr
intake should be >25µg/kg body weight for adults and
between 0.1 and 1.0µg/kg body weight for children and
adolescents (COMA 1991).
Momardica chasintia contained the highest levels of Ni
(3.86 mg/100 g), while S. cordifolia (0.01 mg/100 g) had
the lowest. Ni is exclusively used as an alloy in stainless
steel, in coins, in metal plating (electric water heaters), and
in batteries. It has been reported to cause allergies and
eczema of skin (Jorhem et al. 1996). However, no
maximum limit has been set for Nickel in food.
The presence of heavy metals in plant samples can be
directly attributed to the surrounding pollution in the
environment (e.g., atmospheric and water pollution). Wong
et al. (1993) reported the presence of heavy metals
(cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead,
zinc, and mercury) in 42 Chinese herbal medicines and
attributed their presence to contamination occurring during
air-drying and preservation. Soil condition (e.g., heavily
polluted) also plays a significant role in determining the
heavy metal concentrations of plant materials used for
medicinal purposes (Kabelitz 1998). Januz et al. (1994)
ascertained the contents of heavy metals to be correlated to
industrialized regions, and they concluded that the plants
grown in an industrialized region had higher contents of
heavy metals than plants grown in a second less-
industrialized region.
The mineral and heavy metal concentrations reported
herein might not be on par with some of the earlier reports
on medicinal plants. The differences observed might be due
to different growth conditions, genetic factors, geographical
variations in the level of soil fertility, efficiency of mineral
uptake, and the analytical procedures employed (Özcan and
Akgül 1998).
From the study, we conclude that measuring minerals
and heavy metal concentrations in nutraceutically valued
plant produce is highly significant not only from nutritional
point of view but also to assess the quality when used as
herbal drugs. The result of the present study provides vital
information on the mineral composition for a few of the
popular and nutraceutically valued plants of India, which
need to be explored further to be used as a food supplement
or for food biofortification to exploit the potential health-
promoting properties.
