There are 230 to 240 known Bidens species. Among them, Bidens pilosa is a representative perennial herb, globally distributed
across temperate and tropical regions. B. pilosa has been traditionally used in foods and medicines without obvious adverse effects.
Despite significant progress in phytochemical and biological analyses of B. pilosa over the past few years, comprehensive and critical
reviews of this plant are anachronistic or relatively limited in scope.The present review aims to summarize up-to-date information
on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of B. pilosa from the literature. In addition to botanical studies and records of
the traditional use of B. pilosa in over 40 diseases, scientific studies investigating the potential medicinal uses of this species and its
constituent phytochemicals for a variety of disorders are presented and discussed.The structure, bioactivity, and likely mechanisms
of action of B. pilosa and its phytochemicals are emphasized. Although some progress has been made, further rigorous efforts are
required to investigate the individual compounds isolated from B. pilosa to understand and validate its traditional uses and develop
clinical applications.The present review provides preliminary information and gives guidance for further basic and clinical research
into this plant.
1. Introduction
The United Nations World Health Organization estimates
that as many as 5.6 billion people, 80% of the world popu-
lation, utilize herbal medicine for primary health care [1].1
Plants have formed the foundation of complicated traditional
medicine systems for thousands of years. Medicinal herbs are
applied to treat a wide range of disease categories. The first
written documentation of the use of medicinal herbs dates
from the 26th century BCE in Mesopotamia, and the first
record of the use of medicinal herbs by the Egyptians and
Greeks dates from 18th century BCE and the 5th century
BCE, respectively. Starting around the 11th century BCE,
the Chinese and Indians started to develop herbal medicine
systems, Chinese herbal medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine,
respectively, that continue to be widely practiced today [2].
Therefore, since antiquity, medicinal herbs have played a
prominent role in human health.
B. pilosa is an easy-to-grow herb that is widely distributed
all over the world. It is considered to be a rich source of
food and medicine for humans and animals [3, 4]. There is
increasing global interest in the use of B. pilosa as shown
by the many studies conducted on the plant in recent years.
The folkloric use of B. pilosa has been recorded in America,
Africa, Asia, andOceania [5]. To explore the potential clinical
application of B. pilosa, it is important to link its traditional
use with rigorous evidence-based scientific study.The present
review focuses on recent studies on the botany, traditional

usage, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of B.
pilosa. The information provided here highlights the pos-
sible usefulness of B. pilosa and its isolated compounds
and offers insights into possible future research directions.
Studies of B. pilosa are divided into three groups: (1) the
botany, ethnomedical uses, plant chemistry, pharmacology,
and biosafety of B. pilosa; (2) scientific studies that validate
the ethnomedical uses ofB. pilosa; and (3) the therapeutic and
future research potential of B. pilosa.
1.1. Botany. B. pilosa was first collected and named by Carl
Linnaeus in 1753 [3]. Taxonomically, it is assigned to the
Bidens genus (Asteraceae) as shown in Table 1. This genus is
estimated to include 230 to 240 species worldwide [3, 4]. B.
pilosa has several varieties such as B. pilosa var. radiata, var.
minor, var. pilosa, and var. bisetosa. Alongside examination of
morphological traits, authentication of B. pilosa can be aided
by chemotaxonomy and molecular characterization [8].
B. pilosa is an erect, perennial herb widely distributed
across temperate and tropical regions. B. pilosa is either
glabrous or hairy, with green opposite leaves that are serrate,
lobed, or dissected. It has white or yellow flowers, and long
narrow ribbed black achenes (seeds). It grows to an average
height of 60 cm and a maximum of 150 cm in favorable
environments [9] (Figure 1). B. pilosa prefers full sun and
moderately dry soil. However, it can grow in arid and barren
land from low to high elevations. With the advantage of
being fast-growing, in the 1970s, the Food and Agricultural
Organization actively promoted the cultivation of B. pilosa
in Africa [10]. B. pilosa propagates via seeds. A single plant
can produce 3000–6000 seeds. Dry mature seeds from B.
pilosa can be germinated in 3 to 4 days in moist soil or
after being soaking in water. Seeds are viable for at least 3
years [11]. Minimal agricultural techniques are required for
B. pilosa cultivation. Due to its invasive tendencies, B. pilosa
is generally considered to be a weed [12].
B. pilosa is thought to have originated in South America
and subsequently spread all over the world [13]. Bidens
species and their varieties bear vernacular names based on
their characteristics. For example, Bidens species are known
by such names as Spanish needles, beggar’s ticks, devil’s
needles, cobbler’s pegs, broom stick, pitchforks, and farmers’
friends in English and some other languages because of their
sticky achenes [9] and are sometimes known as xian feng cao
(“all bountiful grass”) in Chinese because of their prosperous
growth.
1.2. Traditional Uses. B. pilosa is used as an herb and as
an ingredient in teas or herbal medicines. Its shoots and
leaves, dried or fresh, are utilized in sauces and teas [14,
15]. In the 1970s, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) promoted the cultivation of B. pilosa in
Africa because it is easy to grow, edible, palatable, and safe
[7]. The nutritional value of B. pilosa is shown in Table 2.
All parts of B. pilosa plant, the whole plant, the aerial
parts (leaves, flowers, seeds, and stems), and/or the roots,
fresh or dried, are used as ingredients in folk medicines. It is
frequently prepared as a dry powder, decoction, maceration
or tincture [16]. Generally, this plant is applied as dry
powder or tincture when used externally, and as a powder,
maceration, or decoction when used as an internal remedy
[15].
As summarized in Table 3, B. pilosa, either as a whole
plant or different parts, has been reported to be useful in
the treatment of more than 40 disorders such as inflamma-
tion, immunological disorders, digestive disorders, infectious
diseases, cancers, metabolic syndrome, wounds, and many
others [26–29]. B. pilosa is usually ingested; however, it can
also be utilized externally. For instance, fresh B. pilosa is used
to treat snake bites and wounds [23], and in Trinidad and
Tobago the aqueous solution of the leaves of B. pilosa is used
to bathe babies and children [22].
B. pilosa is sometimes used alone; it is also used as
an ingredient in medicinal mixtures together with other
medicinal plants such as Aloe vera, Plectranthus mollis,
Valeriana officinalis, andCissus sicyoides among others [17, 18,
20, 25]. Whether the commonly used mixtures of B. pilosa,
or the mixtures of the compounds found in B. pilosa afford
synergistic effects is not yet clear and needs to be verified
by further studies. However, one study has suggested that
B. pilosa varieties share similar phytochemical compositions
and may be substituted for each other [8].
2. Phytochemicals
Interest in basic research and application of B. pilosa has
increased since its first identification in 1753. This is mainly
due to its wide application in medicines, foods, and drinks.
Around 116 publications have documented the exploitation
and medical use of B. pilosa. To date, 201 compounds
comprising 70 aliphatics, 60 flavonoids, 25 terpenoids, 19
phenylpropanoids, 13 aromatics, 8 porphyrins, and 6 other
compounds, have been identified from this plant as compiled
previously [30]. The structures of these compounds are pre-
sented in Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively. However,
the association between B. pilosa phytochemicals and their
bioactivities is not yet fully established and should become
a future research focus. In the present review, we explore
possible associations (Table 11), describe the importance of
the known compounds in relation to their biological activity

and discuss their likelymechanisms of action (Table 3). Com-
pelling evidence suggests that the various diverse bioactivities
reported for B. pilosa reflect its phytochemical complexity.
B. pilosa is an extraordinary source of phytochemicals,
particularly flavonoids and polyynes. Plant flavonoids are
commonly reported to possess anticancer, antiinflammatory,
antioxidant, and other bioactivities. However, the bioactivi-
ties of only seven of the 60 flavonoids present in B. pilosa have
been studied.The bioactivities of the remaining 53 flavonoids
are poorly understood and deserve further investigation.
Other classes of compounds found inB. pilosa are also in need
of further examination, as shown in Table 11.
3. Pharmacological Properties
As outlined in Table 3, B. pilosa is traditionally used to
treat a wide variety of ailments. Different preparations of
its whole plant and/or parts have been purported to treat
over 40 categories of illnesses. Scientific studies, although not
extensive, have demonstrated that B. pilosa extracts and/or
compounds have antitumor [43, 69, 77–83], antiinflamma-
tory [27, 75, 79, 84–88], antidiabetic and antihyperglycemic
[8, 24, 49, 51, 53], antioxidant [70, 89, 90], immunomodu-
latory [50, 69], antimalarial [47, 77], antibacterial [47, 91,
92], antifungal [92, 93], antihypertensive, vasodilatory [28,
94], and antiulcerative [26] activities. In this section, the

primary pharmacological properties of B. pilosa extracts and
phytochemicals are presented and discussed.
3.1. AntiCancer Activity. Folkloric reports revealed the pos-
sible antitumor efficacy of B. pilosa, and several scientific in2
vitro studies have supported the claim that B. pilosa extracts
and isolated compounds possess anti-cancer activities against
a variety of cancer cells. Several studies have used bioassay
guided isolation and fractionation methods to discover new
compounds from B. pilosa. For example, Kviecinski and
colleagues tested hydroalcoholic crude extracts, chloroform,
ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions for anti-tumor activity
[82]. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was assessed using
brine shrimp, hemolytic, MTT, and neutral red uptake
(NRU) assays. In vivo studies were performed using Ehrlich
ascites carcinoma in isogenic BALB/c mice. Among them,

the chloroform fraction was the most toxic with a half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50
) of 97 ± 7.2 and 83 ±
5.2 𝜇g/mL in NRU and MTT, respectively [82]. Kumari and
colleagues also reported the anti-cancer and anti-malarial
activities of B. pilosa leaves [77]. Based on a cytotoxicity-
directed fractionation strategy, they identified phenyl-1,3,5-
heptatriene with IC
50
values of 8±0.01, 0.49±0.45, 0.7±0.01,
and 10 ± 0.01 𝜇g/mL against human oral, liver, colon, and
breast cancer cell lines, respectively. However, phenyl-1,3,5-
heptatriyne showed lower activity against breast cancer cell
lines than the chloroform leaf extract which had an IC
50
value of 6.5 ± 0.01 𝜇g/mL. Moreover, the positive control,
taxol, showed higher activity than phenyl-1,3,5-heptatriyne
[77]. Furthermore, in vitro comet assays were performed to
evaluate the toxicity of n-hexane, chloroform, and methanol
extracts of B. pilosa and its ethyl acetate, acetone, and water
fractions onHela andKB cells.The ethyl acetate fraction from
the methanol extract exhibited the highest activity with half
maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CTC
50
) of 965.2𝜇g/mL
and 586.2𝜇g/mL against Hela and KB cells, respectively.
Despite the moderate toxicity, these findings suggest that
these B. pilosa extracts/fractions could be useful for future

studies [83]. Hot water extracts of B. pilosa var.minor Sheriff
were also assessed for its antileukemic effects on leukemic
cell lines L1210, U937, K562, Raji, and P3HR1 using XTT-
based colorimetric assays. The extract inhibited the five cell
lines with IC

values ranging from 145𝜇g/mL to 586𝜇g/mL.
L1210, K562, Raji, and P3HR1 were more sensitive to B. pilosa
extract with IC
50
values below 200𝜇g/mL [98].
Consistent with the antitumor activities of B. pilosa
extracts and fractions, some of its phytochemicals also
showed anticancer activity as outlined in Table 11. Among
them, luteolin (103), a well-studied flavonoid with multiple
bioactivities, was more effective against tumor cell prolifera-
tion than its derivatives with IC
50
values ranging from 3 𝜇M
to 50𝜇M in cells, and 5 to 10mg/kg in animals. Luteolin was
also found to fight cancer as a food additive at concentrations
of 50 to 200 ppm [78] and prevent skin cancer [78] and cancer3
invasion [103]. Lee and colleagues reported that luteolin
prevents cancer by inhibiting cell adhesion and invasion
[103]. Significant inhibition concentration was reported to be
5 𝜇M and complete inhibition concentration was reported to
be 40𝜇M. Moreover, luteolin was reported to inhibit hepa-
tocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell scattering as well
as cytoskeleton changes such as filopodia and lamellipodia
whichwas determined using phase-contrast and fluorescence
microscopy. Furthermore, luteolin also inhibited the HGF-
induced phosphorylation of c-Met, ERK 1/2, and Akt as
well as the MAPK/ERK and P13K-Akt pathways [78, 103].
Other mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities of
luteolin are the inhibition of topoisomerase I and II, which
inhibits cell replication and DNA repair thus promoting
apoptosis, regulation of PI-3-Kinase/Akt/MAPK/ERK/JNK,
activation of apoptosis in the mitochondrial pathway by
activating caspase 9 and caspase 3, which were found in
malignant cells but not in normal human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, death receptor-induced apoptosis, and a
cell-cycle arrest mechanism, inhibition of fatty acid synthase
which is upregulated in many cancer cells, and sensitization
to chemotherapywhereby luteolin increases the susceptibility
of cancer cells to chemotherapy [78]. Butein (82) is another
flavonoid that showed a cytotoxic effect on human colon
adenocarcinoma cell proliferation with a reported IC
50
value
of 1.75 𝜇M. Butein at 2 𝜇M affected the incorporation of
[14C]-labeled leucine, thymidine, and uridine which can
cause the inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis of
human colon cancer cells. Moreover, butein also exhibited
noncompetitive inhibition of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene
(CDNB) in glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. Tumor
resistance was correlated with high levels of GST, thus, butein
inhibited proliferation of cancer cells [80]. Another flavonoid
present in B. pilosa, centaureidin (109), also showed anti-
cancer activity in B lymphoma cells. Centaureidin, isolated
from Polymnia fruticosa, inhibited tubulin polymerization in
vitro and induced mitotic figure formation in CA46 Burkitt
lymphoma cells. Using turbidimetric assay, the IC
50
value of
centaureidin in inhibition of mitosis was 3𝜇M [104]. Cyto-
toxicity of centaureidin was further analyzed using American
National Cancer Institute (NCI) 60 human tumor cell lines.
The cytotoxicity potency of centaureidin, expressed as GI
50
(50% growth inhibition in the NCI tumor line panel), was
0.24𝜇M [81]. These data mark centaureidin as a promising
antimitotic agent for tumor therapy.
In addition to anti-tumor flavones, polyynes found in B. 4
pilosa have also been shown to possess anti-tumor proper-
ties. Based on a bioactivity-directed isolation approach, Wu
and colleagues identified two polyyne aglycones from the
ethyl acetate fraction of B. pilosa [44]. 1,2-Dihydroxytrideca-
5,7,9,11-tetrayne (48) and 1,3-Dihydroxy-6(E)- tetradecene-
8,10,12-triyne (46) exhibited significant anticell prolifera-
tion activity in primary human umbilical vein endothelium
cells (HUVEC) with IC
50
values of 12.5 𝜇M and 1.73 𝜇M,
respectively. They also decreased angiogenesis and pro-
moted apoptosis in human endothelial cells. Their anti-
angiogenic and cytotoxic effects correlated with activation
of the CDK inhibitors and caspase-7 [44]. In addition, 1,2-
Dihyroxy-5(E)-tridecene-7,9,11-triyne (45) showed antian-
giogenic effects in HUVECs with an IC
50
value of 12.4 𝜇M as
evidenced by a decrease in the tube formation and migration
of HUVECs [43]. The IC
50
value of compound 45 in the
inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced HUVEC
growth was 28.2𝜇M. However, it had higher IC
50
values
than those for lung carcinoma cells and keratinocytes. This
compound could also inhibit cell proliferation of HUVECs,
lung carcinoma A549 cells and HACAT keratinocytes. The
mechanism by which compound 45 inhibits HUVEC growth
and angiogenesis is complicated and includes decreasing the
expression of cell cycle regulators (CDK4, cyclins D1 and A,
retinoblastoma (Rb), and vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor 1), caspase-mediated activation of CDK inhibitors
p21 (Cip1) and p27 (Kip), upregulation of Fas ligand expres-
sion, downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, and activation of
caspase-7 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [43].
3.2. Anti-Inflammatory Activity. B. pilosa is commonly used
to treat inflammatory disorders. The anti-inflammatory phy-
tochemicals present in B. pilosa are listed in Table 11. 5
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a physiologically important
enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandin
(PGE
2
). Its expression is induced by a wide variety of external
stimuli indicating its involvement in inflammatory diseases,
and it is used as an inflammatory marker [88]. Yoshida and
colleagues studied the effects of the aqueous extracts of B.
pilosa aerial parts in the production of COX-2 and PGE
2
as
well as on the activation of mitogen activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) in normal human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) in
response to inflammatory cytokine, IL-1𝛽. This work showed
that IL-1𝛽 activated MAPKs such as ERK1/2, p38, and JNK
to different extents and induced COX-2 expression. The
COX-2 expression in HDFs was regulated mainly by p38
following IL-1𝛽 stimulation. Consistently, the p38 inhibitor
SB203580 blocked this expression. Using this cell platform,
B. pilosa extracts were tested for inhibition of inflammation.
The extract dose-dependently suppressed the activation of
p38 and JNK and moderately suppressed ERK1/2, as well
as suppressing COX-2 expression and PGE
2
production

[88]. This work supports the use of B. pilosa as an anti-
inflammatory agent; however, no compounds responsible for
the anti-inflammatory activity of B. pilosa were identified.
A further study also reported the anti-inflammatory
activity as well as the antiallergic activity of B. pilosa [75]. In
this study, dried powder of the aerial part of B. pilosa, which
had been pretreated with the enzyme cellulosine, was used
for further tests. The results showed that oral administration
of the cellulosine-treated B. pilosa lowered the level of serum
IgE in mice 10 days after immunization with DNP (2,4-
dintrophenyl)-Ascaris as an antigen. This treatment also
reduced dye exudation in skin induced by passive cutaneous
anaphylaxis and production of inflammatory mediators, his-
tamine, and substance P in rats [75]. Phytochemical analysis
showed that cellulosine treatment increased the percentage of
caffeic acid and flavonoids. This study suggests that B. pilosa
and its phenolics have anti-inflammatory functions.
Phenolics and polyynes are major anti-inflammatory
phytochemicals present in B. pilosa (Table 11). Unsurpris-6
ingly, phenolics such as luteolin (103) and ethyl caffeate
(161) that are major constituents of B. pilosa have also
been reported to possess anti-inflammatory activity. Lute-
olin was reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in
macrophages. Xagorari and colleagues showed that luteolin
inhibited the release of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-𝛼 and
interleukin-6, in RAW 264.7 cells following LPS stimulation
[87]. It inhibited TNF-𝛼 production with an IC
50
value
of 1𝜇M. The underlying anti-inflammatory mechanism of
luteolin was reported to be the inactivation of Akt and
NF-𝜅B activation [87]. In addition, luteolin was reported
to confer anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of
LPS-stimulated iNOS expression in BV-2 microglial cells.
It inhibited LPS-activated microglia in a dose-dependent
manner with an IC
50
value of 6.9 𝜇M.Moreover, immunoblot
and RT-PCR data proved that luteolin suppressed I𝜅B-𝛼
degradation and iNOS expression in LPS-activated microglia
[85]. Kim and colleagues stated that luteolin may have
beneficial effects on inflammatory neural diseases through
inhibition of iNOS expression [85]. A related study revealed
that luteolin decreased the transcriptional activity of NF-𝜅B
RelA via partial inhibition of TNF-mediated NF-𝜅B DNA
binding activity. Luteolin also inhibited Akt phosphorylation
and induced degradation of a transcription factor, interferon
regulatory factor (IRF) [86].
Chiang and colleagues showed that ethyl caffeate
(161) significantly inhibited NO production in mouse
macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells [84]. Based on MTT assays,
they concluded that this inhibition was not due to the
cytotoxicity of ethyl caffeate. The IC
50
value of ethyl caffeate
in the inhibition of NO production was 5.5 𝜇g/mL, slightly
lower than curcumin (positive control) which has an
IC
50
value of 6.5𝜇g/mL. They demonstrated that ethyl
caffeate exerted anti-inflammatory activity via the reduced
transcription and translation of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide
synthase) in RAW 246.7 cells. In addition, this compound
also suppressed COX-2 expression in RAW 246.7 cells
and MCF-7 cells. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect
of ethyl caffeate was verified by testing in TPA-treated
mouse skin. Like celecoxib, the positive control, ethyl
caffeate significantly abolished COX-2 expression in a
dose-dependent manner. Ethyl caffeate at 1mg/200𝜇L/site
(24mM) inhibited COX-2 expression at a level comparable
to celecoxib at 1mg/200𝜇L/site (13mM). Remarkably, ethyl
caffeate at 48mM (2mg/200𝜇L/site) was more effective
than celecoxib at 131mM (10mg/200𝜇L/site). Moreover,
this compound inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-𝜅B
(NF-𝜅B) by LPS via the prevention of NF-𝜅B binding to
DNA [84]. In addition, 3 ethyl caffeate analogs (ethyl 3,4-
dihydroxyhydrocinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, and catechol)
also showed different degrees of NF-𝜅B binding to DNA as
listed in Table 12. Ethyl cinnamate lacks a catechol moiety
which results in ineffective inhibition of NF-𝜅B binding to
DNA [84].
Pereira and colleagues assessed the anti- 7
inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of
B. pilosa methanol extract as well as one polyyne,
2-O-𝛽-glucosyltrideca-11(E)-en-3, 5,7,9-tetrayn-1,2-diol
(54) in T lymphocytes and a zymosan-induced arthritis
mouse model [27]. They first examined the in vitro effect of 8
the B. pilosa extract and compound 54 on cell proliferation of
human T cells stimulated with 5𝜇g/mL phytohemagglutinin
(PHA) or 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate
(TPA) plus 15 𝜇M ionomycin and on cell proliferation of
mouse T cells stimulated with 5 𝜇g/mL concanavalin A
(Con A). The data demonstrated that both methanol extract
and compound 54 suppressed T-cell proliferation in a
dose-dependent manner. The estimated IC
50
values of the B.
pilosa extract against human T cells stimulated with 5𝜇g/mL
PHA and 100 nM TPA plus 15𝜇M ionomycin were 12.5 and
25 𝜇g/mL, respectively. In comparison with the methanol
extract, compound 54 showed 10-fold more inhibition of
human T-cell proliferation with an estimated IC
50
value of
1.5 𝜇g/mL. Accordingly, the B. pilosa extract and compound
54 dose-dependently suppressed mouse T-cell proliferation

Taken together, the data indicate that the B. pilosa extract
and compound 54 act on human and mouse T cells. To
test the in vivo effect of the B. pilosa extract and compound
54, a zymosan-induced arthritis mouse model was used.
This model was established from B10.A/SgSnJ mice with an
injection of zymosan (0.15mg). The zymosan-injected mice9
received an intraperitoneal injection of the B. pilosa extract
(1, 5, or 10mg) at one dose a day for 5 days. Popliteal lymph
node (PLN) weight was monitored to check the development
of arthritis. The results revealed that 10mg of the methanol
extract of B. pilosa extract could significantly diminish
inflammation as evidenced by PLN weight [27]. This work
suggests that B. pilosa (and compound 54) can suppress
immune response and inflammation.
3.3. Antidiabetic Activity. Anti-diabetic agents are primarily
developed from plants and other natural resources [8, 24, 49,
51, 53]. B. pilosa is one of 1,200 plant species that have been
investigated for antidiabetic activity [120, 121].B. pilosa is used
as an anti-diabetic herb in America, Africa, and Asia [51, 120,
122]. Many studies have indicated that B. pilosa could treat
type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in animals.
Etiologically speaking, T1D is caused by autoimmune-
mediated destruction of pancreatic 𝛽 cells, leading to insulin
deficiency, hyperglycemia, and complications. Currently,
there is no cure for T1D. Polarization ofTh cell differentiation
controls the development of T1D. Suppression of Th1 cell
differentiation and promotion of Th2 cell differentiation
ameliorate T1D [123]. One study showed that the butanol
fraction of B. pilosa inhibited T-cell proliferation, decreased
Th1 cells and cytokines, and increased Th2 cells and
cytokines, leading to prevention of T1D in nonobese
diabetic (NOD) mice [49]. Based on a bioactivity-directed
isolation strategy, 3 polyynes, 2-𝛽-D-Glucopyranosyloxy
-1-hydroxytrideca-5,7,9,11-tetrayne (53), also known as
cytopiloyne, 3-𝛽-D-Glucopyranosyl-1-hydroxy-6(E)-
tetradecene-8,10,12-triyne (69), 2-𝛽-D- Glucopyranosyloxy-
1-hydroxy-5(E)-tridecene-7,9,11-triyne (50) were identified
from B. pilosa [49, 53]. The IC
50
value of the butanol fraction
was 200𝜇g/mL. This inhibition was reported to be partially
attributed to cytotoxicity because the butanol fraction at

180 𝜇g/mL could cause 50% death of Th1 cells. Moreover,
this study suggested that the butanol fraction may prevent
diabetes in NOD mice in vivo via downregulation of Th1
cells or upregulation Th2 cells that have effects which are
antagonistic of those of Th1 cells [49]. This was proven by
intraperitoneal injection of the butanol fraction at a dose
of 3mg/kg BW, 3 times a week, to NOD mice from 4 to 27
weeks. This dosage resulted in lower incidence of diabetes
(33%). At a dose of 10mg/kg, the butanol fraction of B.
pilosa totally eliminated (0%) the initiation of the disease.
To further support this result, assessment of IgG2a and IgE
production was performed in the serum of NOD mice. As
in vivo results obtained from intracellular cytokine staining,
experiments were not very conclusive levels of IgG2a and IgE
were measured since Th1 cytokine IFN𝛾; and Th2 cytokine
IL-4 favor the production of IgG2a and IgE, respectively. As
expected, high levels of IgE and some decline in the levels of
IgG2a were observed in the serum. Profiling of the butanol
extract revealed five compounds, 3-𝛽-D-Glucopyranosyl-
1-hydroxy-6(E)-tetradecene-8,10,12-triyne (69), 2-𝛽-D-
Glucopyranosyloxy-1-hydroxy-5(E)-tridecene-7,9,11-triyne
(50), 4,5-Di-O-caffeoyl- quinic acid, 3,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic
acid, and 3,4-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid. Only the first two
compounds showed similar effects on the prevention of
diabetes in NOD mice as the B. pilosa butanol fraction.
Moreover, compound 50 showed greater activity than
compound 69 in terms of enhancement (by 34% compared
to 8%) of differentiation of Th0 to Th2 at 15 𝜇g/mL (both

Among the three polyynes found in B. pilosa, cytopiloyne
(53) had the most potent anti-T1D activity [53]. To test the in
vivo effect of cytopiloyne, NODmice received intraperitoneal
or intramuscular injection of cytopiloyne at 25𝜇g/kg BW,
3 times per week. Twelve-week-old NOD mice started to
develop T1D, and 70% of NOD mice aged 23 weeks and
over developed T1D. Remarkably, 12- to 30-week-old NOD
mice treated with cytopiloyne showed normal levels of blood
glucose (<200mg/dL) and insulin (1-2 ng/mL). Consistent

with T1D incidence, cytopiloyne delayed and reduced the
invasion of CD4+ T cells into the pancreatic islets [53].
In vitro study showed that cytopiloyne (53) inhibited the
differentiation of na¨ıveTh (Th0) cells (i.e., CD4+ T cells) into
Th1 cells and promoted differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2
cells [50]. The in vitro data are consistent with the in vivo
results indicating that cytopiloyne reducedTh1differentiation
and increased Th2 differentiation as shown by intracellular
cytokine staining and FACS analysis [53]. In line with the
skewing of Th differentiation, the level of serum IFN-𝛾 and
IgG2c decreased while that of serum IL-4 and serum IgE
increased compared to the negative controls (PBS-treated
mice). Cytopiloyne also enhanced the expression of GATA-
3, a master gene for Th2 cell differentiation, but not the
expression of T-bet, a master gene forTh1 cell differentiation,
further supporting its role in skewingTh differentiation [53].
Also importantly, cytopiloyne partially depleted CD4+
rather than CD8+ T cells in NOD mice [53]. As shown in
Table 13, coculture assays showed that the depletion of CD4+
T cells was mediated through the induction of Fas ligand
expression on pancreatic islet cells by cytopiloyne, leading to
apoptosis of infiltrating CD4+ T cells in the pancreas via the
Fas and Fas ligand pathways. However, cytopiloyne did not
induce the expression of TNF-𝛼 in pancreatic islet cells and,
thus, had no effect on CD8+ T cells [53].
In addition, Chang and colleagues showed that cytopi-
loyne dose-dependently inhibited T-cell proliferation stimu-
lated by IL-2 plus Con A or anti-CD3 antibody, using [3H]
thymidine incorporation assay [53].
Overall, the mechanism of action of cytopiloyne and,
probably, its derivatives in T1D includes inhibition of T-cell
proliferation, skewing of Th cell differentiation, and partial
depletion of Th cells. Due to the anti-diabetic mechanisms

of action, it was hypothesized that cytopiloyne protects
NOD mice from diabetes by a generalized suppression of
adaptive immunity. To evaluate this hypothesis, ovalbumin
(Ova) was used as a T-cell dependent antigen to prime
NOD mice, which had already received cytopiloyne or
PBS vehicle. Ova priming boosted similar anti-Ova titers
in cytopiloyne-treated mice and PBS-treated mice, but a
difference in immunoglobulin isotype was observed in the
two groups. Thus, it was concluded that cytopiloyne is an
immunomodulatory compound rather than an immunosup-
pressive compound [50, 53].
T2D is a chronic metabolic disease with serious com-
plications resulting from defects in either insulin secretion,
insulin action, or both [124]. A study by Ubillas et al.
showed that the aqueous ethanol extract of the aerial part
of B. pilosa at 1 g/kg body weight (BW) lowered blood
glucose in db/db mice, a T2D mouse model [51]. Based
on a bioactivity-guided identification, compounds 69 and
50 were identified. Further, the mixture of the compounds
(69 : 50) in a 2 : 3 ratio significantly decreased blood glucose
concentration and reduced food intake on the second day
of treatment when administered at doses of 250mg/kg twice
a day to C5BL/Ks-db/db mice. When tested at 500mg/kg,
a more substantial drop in blood glucose level as well
as the stronger anorexic effect (food intake reduced from
5.8 g/mouse/day to 2.5 g/mouse/day) was observed [51]. In
this study, it was suggested that the blood glucose lower-
ing effect of B. pilosa was caused, in part, by the hunger
suppressing effect of its polyynes [51]. However, the hunger
suppressing effect of the ethanol extract of B. pilosa was
not found in the studies described below. In another study
[24], water extracts of B. pilosa (BPWE) were used in
diabetic db/db mice, aged 6–8 weeks, with postprandial
blood glucose levels of 350 to 400mg/dL. Like oral anti-
diabetic glimepiride, which stimulates insulin release, one
single dose of BPWE reduced blood glucose levels from
374 to 144mg/dL. The antihyperglycemic effect of BPWE
was inversely correlated to an increase in serum insulin
levels, suggesting that BPWE acts to lower blood glucose via
increased insulin production. However, BPWE had different
insulin secretion kinetics to glimepiride [24]. One flaw in
current anti-diabetics is their decreasing efficacy over time.
The authors investigated the long term anti-diabetic effect
of BPWE in db/db mice. BPWE reduced blood glucose,
increased blood insulin, improved glucose tolerance, and
reduced the percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).
Both long-term and one-time experiments strongly support
the anti-diabetic action of BPWE [24]. In sharp contrast to
glimepiride, BPWE protected against islet atrophy in mouse
pancreas. The investigators further evaluated anti-diabetic
properties of 3 B. pilosa varieties, B. pilosa L. var. radiate
(BPR), B.pilosa L. var. pilosa (BPP), and B. pilosa L. var.minor
(BPM) in db/db mice [8]. One single oral dose (10, 50 and
250mg/kg body weight) of BPR, BPP, or BPM crude extracts
decreased postprandial blood glucose levels in db/db mice
for up to four hours, and the reduction of glucose levels in
the blood appeared to be dose-dependent. Comparing the
three variants, BPR extract resulted in a higher reduction in
blood glucose levels when administered at the same dose as

the other two varieties. In terms of serum insulin levels, a dose
of 50mg/kg of each extract was used, and the BPR extract,
together with the three polyynes, significantly increased the
serum insulin level in db/db mice. Long-term experiments
(28-day treatment) were then conducted using diabetic mice
with postprandial glucose levels from 370 to 420mg/dL, and
glimepiride was used as positive control.The range of dosages
applied was from 10mg/kg BW to 250mg/kg BW. Results
showed that the positive control as well as the crude extracts
of the three varieties lowered the blood glucose levels in
db/db mice. However, only BPR extract, containing a higher
percentage of cytopiloyne (53), reduced blood glucose levels
and augmented blood insulin levelsmore than BPP andBPM.
The percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was
also measured and found to be 7.9% ± 0.5% in mice aged 10–
12 weeks, and 6.6% ± 0.2%, 6.1% ± 0.3% and 6.2% ± 0.3% in
the blood of age-matchedmice following treatment with BPR
crude extract (50mg/kg), glimepiride (1mg/kg), and com-
pound 53 (0.5mg/kg), respectively [8]. Among the polyynes
found in B. pilosa, cytopiloyne was the most effective against
T2D. Hence, cytopiloyne was used for further study on anti-
diabetic action and mechanism [125]. The data confirmed
that cytopiloyne reduced postprandial blood glucose lev-
els, increased blood insulin, improved glucose tolerance,
suppressed HbA1c level, and protected pancreatic islets in
db/db mice. Nevertheless, cytopiloyne failed to decrease
blood glucose in streptoztocin (STZ)-treated mice whose b
cells were already destroyed. Additionally, cytopiloyne dose-
dependently increased insulin secretion and expression in b
cells as well as calcium influx, diacylglycerol, and activation
of protein kinase C𝛼. Collectively, the mechanistic studies
suggest that cytopiloyne treats T2D via regulation of insulin
production involving the calcium/DAG/PKC𝛼 cascade in b
cells.
The studies detailed above point to the conclusion that
cytopiloyne and related polyynes (compounds 69 and 49)
are anti-diabetics in animal models. The data uncover a new
biological action of polyynes. It should be noted that, like
all anti-diabetic drugs, cytopiloyne failed to prevent or cure
diabetes completely but reduced diabetic complications [125].
Intriguingly, 34 polyynes have been found in B. pilosa so far.
It remains to be seen whether all the polyynes present in this
plant have anti-diabetic activities.
3.4. Antioxidant Activity. Free radicals can damage cellular
components via a series of chemical reactions [89] leading
to development and progression of cardiovascular disease,
cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and ageing [70]. Free
radicals, nitric oxide (NO), and superoxide anions can be
produced in macrophages to kill microbes. However, an
excessive generation of the free radicals under pathological
conditions is associated with a wide range of illnesses.
Plants are known to be rich in antioxidant phytochemicals.
Chiang and colleagues evaluated the free radical scaveng-
ing activity of crude extract, fractions, and compounds of
B. pilosa using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and
hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase assays [70]. Using DPPH
and hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase assays, they found that
the B. pilosa crude extract and the ethyl acetate, butanol,
and water fractions had free radical scavenging activity.
Nine compounds, Heptyl- 2-O-𝛽-xylofuranosyl-(1→ 6)-𝛽-
glucopyranoside (199), 3-O-Rabinobioside (124), Quercetin
3-O-rutinoside (130), Chlorogenic acid (167), 3,4-Di-O-
caffeoylquinic acid (169), 3,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (170),
4,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (171), Jacein (119), and Cen-
taurein (110) had DPPH radical scavenging activity [70].
The IC
50
values of the B. pilosa crude extract/fractions and
compounds are summarized in Tables 14 and 15, respectively.
Measurement of free radical scavenging activities is one
way of assessing the antioxidant activities of B. pilosa and
its fractions and compounds. It is interesting that the ethyl
acetate and butanol fractions are more active than the water
fraction and B. pilosa crude extract [70]. Of the secondary
metabolites, only phenolic compounds 124, 130, 167, 169, and
171 showed significant DPPH-radical scavenging activities.
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 43
Further analysis of the structure-activity relationship of the
compounds suggested that substitution of the C3 hydroxyl
group with glycosides increased the activity approximately
2-fold (for example, in compounds 124 and 130) relative to
quercetin (-OH in its C3) [70]. Further modification of the
structures of the active compounds needs to be performed to
test the effects of various substituents on activity. The reason
why most of the antioxidant compounds contain phenol
moieties in their structure could be that the reduction-
oxidation (redox) properties of phenols allow them to act
as reducing agents, singlet oxygen quenchers, and hydrogen
donors.
A complementary study by Muchuweti and colleagues
determined phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and the
phenolic profile of B. pilosa methanol extract [89]. They
estimated that the phenolic content of the methanol extract
of B. pilosawas 1102.8±2.2mg/g [89]. Vanillin, hydroxyben-
zaldehyde, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, and ferulic acid were
found in this extract.The B. pilosa extract also showed DPPH
radical scavenging activity. Furthermore, the antioxidant
activity of the flavonoids found in B. pilosa was correlated
with its hepatoprotective effects through their inhibition
of NF-𝜅B activation which may lessen the oxidative stress
caused by the production of free radicals during liver injury
[60].This activity might also be due to the anti-inflammatory
effects of the aqueous extracts of B. pilosa aerial parts on the
inhibition of COX-2 and PGE
2
production [88].
Essential oils from B. pilosa flowers and leaves are also
reported to possess antioxidant activity. With the aim of
replacing chemically synthesized additives, Deba and col-
leagues [92] worked on the antioxidant, antibacterial, and
antifungal activities of essential oils and water extracts of B.
pilosa’s leaves and flowers. Table 16 summarizes the results
obtained from DPPH free radical scavenging assay.
It can be inferred fromTable 16 that essential oils from the
leaves possessed the highest activity. It is reported elsewhere
that monoterpenes present in essential oils such that of B.
pilosa have protective effects and antioxidant properties [92].
Beta-carotene bleaching method was also performed. Leaves
essential oils and aqueous extracts of the leaves and flowers
showed higher activity than the flower essential oils. This is
due to the volatility of the flower essential oils. The activity
exhibited by the aqueous extracts was accounted to the
presence of phenolic compounds that are reported to donate
a hydrogen atom to free radicals such that the propagation of
the chain reaction during lipid oxidation is terminated [92].
Overall, essential oils and phenolics present in B. pilosa can
be thought of as major antioxidant compounds.
3.5. Immunomodulatory Activity. B. pilosa is thought to be
an immunomodulatory plant and is reported to be effective
in the treatment of immune disorders such as allergy [75],
arthritis [75], and T1D [48, 50, 53].
As pointed out in the discussion of its anti-diabetic
activities (Section 3.3), a combination of phytochemicals
method and T-cell activation assays was used to study
immunomodulatory properties of B. pilosa. IFN-𝛾 is a key
cytokine released by T and NK cells that mediates immune
cells and sustains immunity against pathogens. Defects in
IFN-𝛾 expression, regulation, and activation result in vulner-
ability to diseases caused by bacteria and viruses [69]. An
elegant study, performed byChang and colleagues using IFN-
𝛾 promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct in Jurkat
T cells, showed that hot water crude extracts of B. pilosa
increased IFN-𝛾 promoter activity two-fold [69]. Out of the
subfractions of this extract, the butanol fraction, but not the
water or ethyl acetate, fractions, increased IFN-𝛾 promoter
activity six-fold. Centaurein (110) and centaureidin (109)
were identified from the butanol fraction and were stated to
cause a four-fold increase in IFN-𝛾 promoter activity with
EC
50
values of 75 𝜇g/mL and 0.9𝜇g/mL, respectively. The
mechanism of action of centaurein was determined using
transcription factors such as AP-1, NFAT, and NF𝜅B which
are reported to bind to IFN-𝛾 promoter and regulate IFN-𝛾
transcription. Unlike with the activity of the positive control,
PHA, centaurein caused a four-fold increase in NFAT, a
3-fold increase in NF𝜅B and had little, if any, effect on
AP-1 enhancer activities (23-fold, three-fold, and ten-fold
increases, respectively, were seenwith PHA) [69].The authors
concluded that centaureinmodulates IFN-𝛾 expression by the
NFAT and NF𝜅B pathways. The article only determined the
mechanism of action of centaurein. Its aglycone centaureidin
may act through the samemechanism though this conclusion
needs to be further verified.
B. pilosa extract and its compounds are reported to inhibit
differentiation of na¨ıve CD4+ helper T (Th0) cells into Th1
cells [49]. Using theThcell differentiation assay as a screening
platform, 3 polyynes, 2-𝛽-D-glucopyranosyloxy-1 -
hydroxytrideca-5,7,9,11-tetrayne (53), 3-𝛽-D-glucopyranosyl-
1-hydroxy-6(E)- tetradecene-8,10,12-triyne (69), and 2-𝛽-D-
glucopyranosyloxy-1-hydroxy-5(E)- tridecene-7,9,11-triyne
(49) were discovered from B. pilosa [49, 53]. The data shows
that cytopiloyne and other two polyynes suppressed the
differentiation of type 1 helper T (Th1) cells and production
of Th1 cytokines and promoted that of type 2 helper T (Th2)
cells and production of Th2 cytokines, thus explaining the
immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of B.
pilosa and its polyynes.
Chang and colleagues were the first to report the effect of
the butanol extract of B. pilosa on the autoimmune diabetes
and airway inflammation inmice [48]. Imbalance in the levels
ofTh1 andTh2 and of various cytokines leads to autoimmune
diseases. T1D and other autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid
arthritis, Crohn’s disease, among others) are exacerbated by
an increase Th1 levels (specifically, CD4+ Th1 cells) while
Th2 cells antagonize this effect [19]. Moreover, Th2 cells
mediate asthma in ovalbumin-induced hypersensitivity in
BALB/c mice [48]. In their work [48], Chang and colleagues
showed that 10mg/kg butanol extracts with 1.5% (w/w)
compound 69 and 1.1% (w/w) compound 49 (Table 11)
ameliorated the development of Th1-mediated diabetes in
NOD mice through inhibition of 𝛽 cell death and leukocyte
infiltration. At the same dosage, the butanol extracts also
exacerbated ovalbumin-induced pulmonary inflammation
in BALB/c mice with an increase in the infiltration of
eosinophils and mast cells into the airway of the mice [48].
Despite the different outcomes, both mouse models proved
44 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
the concept that control over the Th1/Th2 shift is associated
with autoimmune diseases and that the B. pilosa butanol
extract can shift the differentiation of Th0 cells to Th2 cells
[48, 49].
An extended study presented by Chiang and colleagues
showed that compound 53 modulates T-cell functions [50].
Using CD4+ T cells from BALB/c mice, they demonstrated
that cytopiloyne decreased levels of IFN-𝛾 producing cells
(Th1) by 12.2% (from 72% to 59.8%). Since Th1 and Th2 cell
differentiation is antagonistic, it was expected that compound
53 increased the percentage of mouse IL-4 producing cells
(Th2) by 7.2% (from 23.7% to 30.9%). Subsequent assess-
ment of effect of compound 53 on the modulation of the
transcription of IL-4 and IFN-𝛾 showed that cytopiloyne, as
expected, decreased the splenocyte levels of IFN-𝛾 mRNA
and increasing that of IL-4 in a dose-dependent manner. In
the range of 0.1 to 3 𝜇g/mL of compound 53, the effects were
not attributed to its cytotoxicity. Consequently, using 3𝜇g/mL
cytopiloyne for 72 and 96 hours, the protein concentration of
IFN-𝛾 decreased to 18.6% and 44.4%, respectively. Under the
same conditions, cytopiloyne increased IL-4 concentrations
to 198.5% and 247.0% (for 72 and 96 hours, resp.). This
modulation of T-cell differentiation exhibited by compound
53 was used to explain its anti-diabetic activity [50].
The anti-diabetic role of cytopiloyne was extensively
discussed above (Section 3.3, anti-diabetic activity). The
molecular basis of the regulation of cytokine expression by
cytopiloyne has been described. Cytopiloyne directly elevated
the expression level of IL-4 via GATA-3 upregulation in
T cells [53]. However, reduction of IFN-𝛾 expression in T
cells seemed to come from the indirect opposing effect IL-4
cytokine because the expression level of T-bet was unaltered
[53]. In this way, cytopiloyne skewedTh1 polarization into the
Th2 state, conferring protection against T1D in NOD mice.
Aside frompolarization ofThcell differentiation, cytopiloyne
also activated the expression of Fas ligand in pancreatic
b cells, this increase leading to the partial depletion of T
cells and reduction of immune response in local areas such
as the pancreas. Of note, cytopiloyne also inhibited T-cell
proliferation and activation. By targeting T cells from three
immunomodulatory actions, cytopiloyne protects against
T1D and probably other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases
[19].
The phytochemical constituents of B. pilosa exert their
functions on different immune cells to modulate immune
response. It is possible that some of the compounds may
have agonistic or antagonistic effects on immune response.
Immune function of B. pilosa may depend on its compo-
sition and amount of compounds, which could explain the
apparently conflicting report of B. pilosa butanol extract
aggravating allergy in mice [48] while cellulosine-treated
extract ameliorated allergy [48, 75]. IFN-𝛾 promoter reporter
assays and T-cell differentiation assays were used to isolate
2 flavonoids [69] and 3 polyynes [49, 50] as immunomod-
ulatory compounds from the butanol fraction of B. pilosa.
Interestingly, the flavonoids promote IFN-𝛾 expression in
NK and T cells. In marked contrast, the polyynes promote
IL-4 expression and indirectly inhibit IFN-𝛾 expression in
differentiating T cells. Sensitivity appears to be the key to
identifying structure- and bioactivity-related phytochemicals
from medicinal plants.
3.6. Antimalarial Activity. The use of chemical drugs against
pathogens has resulted in drug-resistant mutants. Examples
of drug resistance can be found in the species of the
Plasmodium that cause malaria. It is important to search for
new compounds to combat Plasmodium parasites [47]. A
study of the anti-malarial activity of the leaf extracts of B.
pilosa using a combination of phytochemistry and bioassays
showed that compound 49 (Table 11) showed activity against
a malaria parasite (P. falciparum NF54 strain) with an IC
50
value of 6.0 𝜇g/mL [77]. In addition, compound 49, isolated
from the aerial parts of B. pilosa, inhibited growth of the P.
falciparum FCR-3 strain with an IC
50
value of 0.35 𝜇g/mL.
This compound was tested for its in vivo effect in mice
infected with P. berghei NK-65 strain. Results showed that
compound 49 decreased the average parasitemia in the red
blood cells by 20.7 (from 32.8% of that of the control to
12.1%) after an intravenous injection of 0.8mg/kg BW/day for
four days [47]. Further studies addressing the anti-malarial
mechanism underlying both polyynes and clinical studies are
needed.
3.7. Antibacterial Activity. Emergence of multiple antibiotic-
resistantmicrobes is becoming a global threat to public health
and a challenge to disease treatment. For instance, penicillin
is commonly used to combat a food-borne intracellular
bacteriumListeria; however, penicillin-resistant bacteria have
been discovered recently [69]. Chang and coworkers iso-
lated centaurein (110) and centaureidin (109) from B. pilosa
extract [69, 70]. Centaurein enhances expression of IFN-𝛾,
a key cytokine for macrophage activation and, consequently,
enhances bactericidal activity in macrophages [69, 70]. In
agreement with observed in vitro effects, centaurein was
reported to prevent and treat Listeria infection in C57BL/6J
mice [91]. Mechanistic studies confirmed that centaurein
exerted antilisterial action via IFN-𝛾 expression in wild-type
mice but not IFN-𝛾 knockout mice [91]. Further in vitro
studies on centaurein showed that this compound increased
IFN-𝛾 expression by 13% (from 17% to 20%), 20% (from 21%
to 41%), and 11% (from 6% to 17%) in CD4+ T cells, CD8+T
cells, and NK cells, respectively. That is to say, there was
an increase in IFN-𝛾 producing immune cells. As expected,
centaurein also enhanced the expression level of T-bet, a key
nuclear factor for IFN-𝛾 expression. Consistently, centaurein
augmented the serum IFN-𝛾 levels inC57BL/6Jmice, and this
augmentation peaked 24 hours after compound injection.
The quantity of mouse serum IFN-𝛾 was sufficient to activate
macrophages in vitro and eradicated GFP-producing Listeria
inside macrophages. However, the entry of Listeria into
macrophages was not affected by centaurein-treated mouse
sera. Centaurein treatment at 20𝜇g per mouse rescued 30%
of the mice infected with a lethal dose of Listeria (2 ×
106 CFU). It is noteworthy that in the presence of ampicillin
(5 𝜇g/mouse), centaurein (20 𝜇g/mouse) rescued 70% of the
mice, suggesting an additive effect between ampicillin and
centaurein [91]. Despite lower abundance, centaureidin was
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 45
30 times more active than centaurein in terms of IFN-𝛾
production [91].
Aside from the indirect antibacterial action mentioned
above, extract and/or compounds of B. pilosa also showed
direct bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal action. One study
reported that essential oils and leaf/flower extracts of B.
pilosa could suppress the growth of gram positive and gram
negative bacteria as evidenced by zone of inhibition assays.
In this study, antibacterial activity of the essential oils from
the leaves and flowers of B. pilosa was determined in an
attempt to identify natural products as food preservatives for
prevention of microbial multiplication and food oxidation.
The essential oils and extracts of B. pilosa leaves and flow-
ers showed moderate but different extents of antibacterial
activity (Table 17). In general, essential oils had higher
antibacterial activity than crude extracts. One explanation for
this could be that monoterpenes in the essential oils destroy
cellular integrity and, subsequently, inhibit the respiration
and ion transport processes. The presence of antibacterial
𝛽-caryophyllene could be another explanation as reported
elsewhere [92]. Another study reported that the methanol
and acetone extract of B. pilosa roots displayed antibacterial
activities against the bacteria listed in Table 18 [93] and
methanol extracts from the roots seemed to be the most
effective.
Another study indicated that the polyyne, (R)-1,2-
dihydroxytrideca-3,5,7,9,11-pentayne (49), from this plant
also suppressed bacterial growth as shown by the minimum
inhibitory concentration required to inhibit 50% bacterial
growth (MIC
50
) in Table 19. This compound was highly
effective against several Gram positive and Gram negative
bacteria including the drug-resistant bacteria Staphylococcus
aureus N315 (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis NCTC12201
(VRE) [47]. Strikingly, compound 49 had a similar MIC
50
value to antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, and
amphotericin B) in most of the bacteria tested.
Antibacterial activity of B. pilosa extracts and compo-
nents, expressed as MIC
50
and the mean zone of inhibition,
is tabulated in Tables 17, 18, and 19.The zone of inhibition for
Ampicilline (positive control) ranges from 15.3 ± 0.3mm to
44.3 ± 0.2mm [92].
3.8. Antifungal Activity. B. pilosa has traditionally been used
to treat microbial infection. Recently, different parts of B.
pilosa have been tested for antifungal activities. Deba and
colleagues first evaluated the antifungal effect of the hot
water extracts of the B. pilosa roots, stems, and leaves against
Corticium rolfsii, Fusarium solani, and Fusarium oxysporum.
They discovered that C. rolfsii was most suppressed by
treatment with B. pilosa as its growth was reduced at almost
all the tested doses, followed by F. oxysporum and F. solani
[99]. However, the fungicidal activities of the stems, and
roots were greater than the leaves [99]. Moreover, the same
group assessed the antifungal activity of the essential oils
and aqueous extracts from B. pilosa flowers and leaves [92].
They showed that the extracts and oils had antifungal activity
against C. rolfsii, F. solani, and F. oxysporum. Essential oils
appeared to have better fungicidal activity thanwater extracts
as summarized in Table 20.
Another study by Ashafa and colleagues showed that
acetone, methanol, and water extracts of the B. pilosa roots
showed antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger, A.
flavus, and Penicillium notatum using the agar dilution
method. The results are tabulated in Table 21 [93]. Negative
controls showed 0% growth inhibition.The methanol extract
of the B. pilosa roots at 10mg/mL was also effective against
Candida albicans [93].Of note, B. pilosa obtained fromPapua
New Guinea had no activity against A. niger and C. albicans
[126], but the SouthAfrican (EasternCape) ecotype exhibited
moderate activity against C. albicans [93]. This discrepancy
may depend on extraction solvents, extraction procedure,
assay techniques, different plant parts, and abundance of
active compounds.
B. pilosa produces a variety of secondary metabolites
such as flavonoids, phenylacetylenes, alkaloids, sterols, ter-
penoids, and tannis [92, 93]. However, none of them have
been confirmed as active compounds against fungi. Further
investigation of active compounds from B. pilosa is necessary
to further understand the antifungal efficacy of this plant.
3.9. Hypotensive and Vasodilatory Activities. In early studies,
Dimo and colleagues used three rat models, normotensive
Wistar rats (NTR), salt-loading hypertensive rats (SLHR),
and spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) to investigate the
hypotensive effect of the methanol crude extract of B. pilosa
leaves [28, 127]. The extract lowered systolic blood pressure
in hypertensive rats (SLHR and SHR) to a greater degree
than NTR [28, 127]. In addition, a decrease in urinary
sodium ions and an increase in urinary potassium ions were
observed after treatment with the methanol extract of B.
pilosa leaves although neither differences were statistically
significant [28, 127]. Taking the data together, the study
proposed that B. pilosa leaf extract reduced blood pressure
via vasodilation [28, 127]. The same group continued to
test the antihypertensive effect of aqueous and methylene
chloride extracts of B. pilosa leaves in a hypertensive rat
model [28, 127]. To establish a fructose-induced hypertension
model, male Wistar rats were given 10% fructose solution
to drink ad libitum for three weeks. In addition to free
access to 10% fructose, the rats were treated with the aqueous
(150mg/kg) or methyl chloride (350mg/kg) extracts of B.
pilosa for additional three weeks [28, 127]. Both extracts of
B. pilosa leaves had a hypotensive effect on rats. However,
neither extracts reversed the elevation of serum insulin in
fructose-fed rats. Therefore, B. pilosa lowered blood pressure
irrespective of insulin [28, 127]. To better understand the
hypotensive mechanism, the authors investigated the effect
of a neutral extract of B. pilosa (NBP), a mixture of methanol
andmethylene chloride (1 : 1) extract after neutralization with
NaOH and HCl, on the heart and the blood pressure of
NTR and SHR [110]. This study showed that an intravenous
injection of the NBP resulted in a biphasic reduction in
systolic blood pressure. In addition, one intravenous dose of
the extract at 10, 20, and 30mg/kg BW decreased systolic
blood pressure in normal rats by 18.3%, 42.5%, and 30%,
46 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
respectively, and the same doses reduced the blood pressure
in hypertensive rats by 25.8%, 38.9%, and 28.6%, respectively.
Only the highest dose (30mg/kg) affected the force of the
contraction of the heart. Atropine and propranolol were used
to interfere with the hypotensive action of the NBP. Atropine
reduced the initial phase of the hypotensive response in NBP
and completely abolished the second phase of hypotensive
response in NBP. In contrast, propranolol increased the
first hypotensive response but partially abolished the second
hypotensive response provoked by the NBP [110].This mech-
anistic study suggested that B. pilosa invokes the biphasic
hypotensive responses via targeting cardiac pump efficiency
during the first phase and vasodilation at the second phase
[110].
A further study was performed to investigate the relaxing
effect of a neutral extract of B. pilosa (NBP) on rat aorta con-
tractedwithKCl (60mM) andnorepinephrine (0.1mM) [94].
Cumulative addition of NBP relaxed the rat aorta previously
contracted by KCl in a dose-dependent manner. The EC
50
value of theNBP for vasorelaxationwas 0.32mg/mL.Thedata
also showed that the NBP reduced the contraction of aorta
previously contracted by KCl irrespective of the presence of
aortic endothelium [94].
Pretreatment with glibenclamide, an ATP-dependent K+
channel blocker, did not considerably affect the relaxant effect
of the NBP on KCl-induced contraction, suggesting that
the vasodilatory effect of B. pilosa was not related to the
opening of this ATP-dependent K+ channel [94]. On the
other hand, in the presence of indomethacin or pyrilamine
maleate, the relaxant response induced by the plant extract
was significantly inhibited at the lower concentrations. The
plant extract was able to reduce the aorta resting tone, inhibit
the KCl-induced contractions by 90% at 1.5mg/mL and the
CaCl
2
-induced contractions by 95% at 0.75mg/mL. These
results demonstrate that B. pilosa can act as a vasodilator
probably via acting as a calcium antagonist [94].
However, no specific compound for the above activity
has been identified from B. pilosa to date. A bioactivity-
guided identification approach may be adopted to identify
the active compounds in B. pilosa that possess hypotensive
and vasodilatory effects and understand their mechanism of
action.
3.10. Wound Healing Activity. B. pilosa has been traditionally
used to treat tissue injury inCameroon, Brazil, andVenezuela
[26]. Hassan and colleagues investigated the wound healing
potential of B. pilosa in Wistar rats [128]. Mirroring the
positive control neomycin sulfate, the ethanol extract of B.
pilosa had faster wound closure than control rats 3, 6, and 9
days after topical application. Histological examination also
revealed better collagenation, angiogenesis, and organization
of wound tissue seven days after application. Epithelialization
and total healing time in B. pilosa-treated rats were compara-
ble to those of neomycin sulfate. Together, these data suggest
that B. pilosa may be a viable alternative to neomycin lotion
for the treatment of wounds.
In addition to studying the wound healing effect of B.
pilosa on external ulcers, Tan and colleagues also examined
the effect of methanol, cyclohexane, and methyl chloride
extracts of B. pilosa on gastric ulcers in Wistar rats fed
with 1mL HCl/ethanol gastric necrotizing solution (150mM
HCl in 60% ethanol), and macroscopically visible lesions
were scored [26]. Among the three extracts, methylene chlo-
ride extracts exhibited the highest activity showing 46.4%
inhibition of lesion formation at a dose of 500mg/kg BW
and complete inhibition at 750mg/kg [26]. The efficacy of
the ethylene chloride extract was followed by that of the
methanol extracts which had inhibition ranging from 30.4%
to 82.2% at concentrations of 500mg/kg and 1000mg/kg
BW, respectively [26]. The cyclohexane extracts showed the
lowest activity against gastric ulcers in rats with 13.3%,
40%, and 79.7% inhibition at 500, 750, and 1000mg/kg BW,
respectively [26]. To better understand the mode of action
of the methylene chloride extract of B. pilosa, rats were
pretreated with indomethacin, a COX-2 inhibitor involved in
prostaglandin synthesis. Pretreatment significantly reduced
the protection against HCl/ethanol-induced ulcers to 31.3%
inhibition at 750mg/kg BW, suggesting a link between the
antiulcerative activity of B. pilosa and prostaglandin syn-
thesis. Unexpectedly, the methylene chloride extract of B.
pilosa showed little gastric mucosal protection against gastric
lesions induced by 95% ethanol (1mL) [26]. Absolute alcohol
is known to cause mucosal/submucosal tissue destruction via
cellular necrosis and the release of tissue-derived mediators
(histamine and leukotrieneC4).Thus, these data imply thatB.
pilosa did not prevent the generation or the necrotic action of
these mediators on the gastric microvasculature. In addition,
pylorus ligation can increase gastric acid secretion without
an alteration of mucosal histamine content. The methylene
chloride extract of B. pilosa did not possess antisecretory
activity. On the contrary, it was observed that increases in the
dose of the extract led to elevated gastric juice acidity [26].
Results with both absolute ethanol and pylorus ligation rat
models suggested the possibility that the ineffectiveness of B.
pilosa against gastric ulcers was due to lack of antihistaminic
activity in the plant. In summary, overall the data suggest that
B. pilosa protects against HCL/ethanol-mediated ulcers via
inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis.
Previous phytochemical studies showed that a group
of flavonoids, acyclichalcones, are present in B. pilosa
[129, 130] and the chalcones were proposed to have anti-
ulcerative activity [131]. Moreover, nine hydroxychalcones 10
were reported to possess gastric cytoprotective effects with
2,4-dihydroxychalcone being the most active [132]. Since
methylene chloride extracts appear to be the most active B.
pilosa extracts, next, the specific anti-ulcerative phytochemi-
cals in the methylene chloride extracts of B. pilosa and their
modes of action needs to be probed.
Despite the claims listed inTable 3, relatively few scientific
studies have been conducted in vitro and in vivo to address the
traditional ethnomedical uses of B. pilosa. Information about
the use of B. pilosa as a botanical therapy recorded so far is
far from complete. Studies conducted thus far only serve as
a starting point for further investigation of B. pilosa, and the
ultimate efficacious use of the herb in clinical applications.

4. Toxicology
Despite its use as an ingredient in food for human con-
sumption, studies on systemic toxicity (e.g., acute, subacute,
chronic and subchronic toxicities) of B. pilosa in humans
and animals are still inadequate and insufficient. So far,
acute, and/or subchronic toxicities have been evaluated in
rats and mice. Oral acute and 28-day toxicities of water
extract of B. pilosa leaves were evaluated in Wistar rats
[133]. An oral dose of water extract of B. pilosa leaves at
10 g/kg BW showed no obvious mortality or changes in
the appearance in rats [134]. The same extract at 0.8 g/kg
BW/day, once a day, showed no obvious sub-chronic toxicity
in rats over 28 days, as measured by survival rate, body
weight, and gross examination of organs [134]. These data
are consistent with our data indicating that oral delivery
of the water extract of the B. pilosa whole plant at 1 g/kg
BW/day, once a day, is safe in rats over 28 days (unpublished
data). Taken together, these studies suggest that ingestion of
B. pilosa aqueous extract at up to at 1 g/kg BW/day, once
a day, is highly safe in rats. In addition, the acute toxicity
of aqueous and ethanol extracts of B. pilosa in mice have
been reported [134]. Five- to six-week-old mice with weights
between 28 and 35 g received a peritoneal injection of both
extracts at the different doses. The LD
50
, the dose that causes
50% lethality, of the aqueous and ethanol extracts in mice
was 12.30 g/kg BW and 6.15 g/kg BW, respectively [134]. A
complete toxicological study has not been completed for
humans. Furthermore, the drug interactions of B. pilosa with
other drugs are unknown. Further safety verification and
clinical trials should be performed before B. pilosa can be
considered for medicinal use.
5. Conclusions
B. pilosa is an erect, perennial plant with green leaves, white
or yellow flowers and tiny black seeds. As it is distributed
worldwide and is widely used as a folk remedy, B. pilosa
can be thought of as an extraordinary source of food and
medicine. However, a comprehensive up-to-date review of
research on B. pilosa has hitherto been unavailable. In this
article, scientific studies on B. pilosa have been summarized
and critically discussed from the perspectives of botany,
ethnomedicine, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicol-
ogy. B. pilosa is claimed to treat more than 40 disorders,
and 201 compounds have been identified from this plant.
The medicinal utility of B. pilosa and its modes of action
in relation to its known phytochemicals were discussed
herein. Polyynes, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, fatty acids,
and phenolics are the primary bioactive compounds of B.
pilosa, and they have been reported to be effective in the
treatment of tumors, inflammation/immune modulation,
diabetes, viruses, microbes, protozoans, gastrointestinal dis-
eases, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Caution
should be exercised in the therapeutic use of B. pilosa for
hypoglycemia, hypotension, bleeding, and allergy.
