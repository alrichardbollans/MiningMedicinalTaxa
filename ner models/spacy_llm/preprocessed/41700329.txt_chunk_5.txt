They first examined the in vitro effect of 8 the B. pilosa extract and compound 54 on cell proliferation of human T cells stimulated with 5g/mL phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) plus 15 M ionomycin and on cell proliferation of mouse T cells stimulated with 5 g/mL concanavalin A (Con A). The data demonstrated that both methanol extract and compound 54 suppressed T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The estimated IC 50 values of the B. pilosa extract against human T cells stimulated with 5g/mL PHA and 100 nM TPA plus 15M ionomycin were 12.5 and 25 g/mL, respectively. In comparison with the methanol extract, compound 54 showed 10-fold more inhibition of human T-cell proliferation with an estimated IC 50 value of 1.5 g/mL. Accordingly, the B. pilosa extract and compound 54 dose-dependently suppressed mouse T-cell proliferation 36 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 9: Porphyrins isolated from B. pilosa [30].

Taken together, the data indicate that the B. pilosa extract and compound 54 act on human and mouse T cells. To test the in vivo effect of the B. pilosa extract and compound 54, a zymosan-induced arthritis mouse model was used. This model was established from B10.A/SgSnJ mice with an injection of zymosan (0.15mg). The zymosan-injected mice9 received an intraperitoneal injection of the B. pilosa extract (1, 5, or 10mg) at one dose a day for 5 days. Popliteal lymph node (PLN) weight was monitored to check the development of arthritis. The results revealed that 10mg of the methanol extract of B. pilosa extract could significantly diminish inflammation as evidenced by PLN weight [27]. This work suggests that B. pilosa (and compound 54) can suppress immune response and inflammation. 3.3. Antidiabetic Activity. Anti-diabetic agents are primarily developed from plants and other natural resources [8, 24, 49, 51, 53]. B. pilosa is one of 1,200 plant species that have been investigated for antidiabetic activity [120, 121].B. pilosa is used as an anti-diabetic herb in America, Africa, and Asia [51, 120, 122]. Many studies have indicated that B. pilosa could treat type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in animals. Etiologically speaking, T1D is caused by autoimmune- mediated destruction of pancreatic  cells, leading to insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and complications. Currently, there is no cure for T1D. Polarization ofTh cell differentiation controls the development of T1D. Suppression of Th1 cell differentiation and promotion of Th2 cell differentiation ameliorate T1D [123]. One study showed that the butanol fraction of B. pilosa inhibited T-cell proliferation, decreased Th1 cells and cytokines, and increased Th2 cells and cytokines, leading to prevention of T1D in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice [49]. Based on a bioactivity-directed isolation strategy, 3 polyynes, 2--D-Glucopyranosyloxy -1-hydroxytrideca-5,7,9,11-tetrayne (53), also known as cytopiloyne, 3--D-Glucopyranosyl-1-hydroxy-6(E)- tetradecene-8,10,12-triyne (69), 2--D- Glucopyranosyloxy- 1-hydroxy-5(E)-tridecene-7,9,11-triyne (50) were identified from B. pilosa [49, 53]. The IC 50 value of the butanol fraction was 200g/mL. This inhibition was reported to be partially attributed to cytotoxicity because the butanol fraction at 38 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 10: Other compounds isolated from B. pilosa [30].

Moreover, this study suggested that the butanol fraction may prevent diabetes in NOD mice in vivo via downregulation of Th1 cells or upregulation Th2 cells that have effects which are antagonistic of those of Th1 cells [49]. This was proven by intraperitoneal injection of the butanol fraction at a dose of 3mg/kg BW, 3 times a week, to NOD mice from 4 to 27 weeks. This dosage resulted in lower incidence of diabetes (33%). At a dose of 10mg/kg, the butanol fraction of B. pilosa totally eliminated (0%) the initiation of the disease. To further support this result, assessment of IgG2a and IgE production was performed in the serum of NOD mice. As in vivo results obtained from intracellular cytokine staining, experiments were not very conclusive levels of IgG2a and IgE were measured since Th1 cytokine IFN; and Th2 cytokine IL-4 favor the production of IgG2a and IgE, respectively. As expected, high levels of IgE and some decline in the levels of IgG2a were observed in the serum. Profiling of the butanol extract revealed five compounds, 3--D-Glucopyranosyl- 1-hydroxy-6(E)-tetradecene-8,10,12-triyne (69), 2--D- Glucopyranosyloxy-1-hydroxy-5(E)-tridecene-7,9,11-triyne (50), 4,5-Di-O-caffeoyl- quinic acid, 3,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and 3,4-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid. Only the first two compounds showed similar effects on the prevention of diabetes in NOD mice as the B. pilosa butanol fraction. Moreover, compound 50 showed greater activity than compound 69 in terms of enhancement (by 34% compared to 8%) of differentiation of Th0 to Th2 at 15 g/mL (both Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 39 Table 11: Chemical constituents of B. pilosa and their biological activities.
