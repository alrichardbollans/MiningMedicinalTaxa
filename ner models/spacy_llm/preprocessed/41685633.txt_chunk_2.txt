Food Anal. Methods (2010) 3:181–187 185
15 mg/kg body weight (FAO/WHO 1989). In an earlier
work, Liang et al. (1998) measured various metallic
elements in commercial Chinese medicines using AAS
and reported approximately 10 mg/100 g of arsenic in the
samples analyzed. However, the results on Hg (Table 3)
were contradictory to an earlier report by Dahanukar et al. (1998) who found high levels of Hg (in six samples) that
exceeded the permissible amounts (1–7.5 ppm). Contami-
nation by Hg occurs mainly via its usage in dental
amalgam, electric switches, and batteries, which then finds
its way into soil. Hg poisoning causes inflammation of the
mouth, stomach, and colon and acute abdominal pain, and
it affects the kidneys. Chromium is one of the trace metal nutrients that are
essential to humans and animals. Its principal role appears
to be in helping to maintain normal glucose tolerance in the
body (Strickland et al. 1972). Chromium was highest in V.
zizinalis (6.74 mg/100 g), followed by Bacopa monnieri
(2.88 mg/100 g), and it was lowest in Chlorophytum
borivilianum (0.08 mg/100 g). The main source of Cr
contamination occurs via the use of plating metal, as an
alloy of stainless steel, and in tanning of hides. Because Cr
is not known to have any toxic effects, no maximum intake
limit has been set. However, in the UK, the Committee on
Medical Aspects of Food Policy has recommended that Cr
intake should be >25µg/kg body weight for adults and
between 0.1 and 1.0µg/kg body weight for children and
adolescents (COMA 1991). Momardica chasintia contained the highest levels of Ni
(3.86 mg/100 g), while S. cordifolia (0.01 mg/100 g) had
the lowest. Ni is exclusively used as an alloy in stainless
steel, in coins, in metal plating (electric water heaters), and
in batteries. It has been reported to cause allergies and
eczema of skin (Jorhem et al. 1996). However, no
maximum limit has been set for Nickel in food. The presence of heavy metals in plant samples can be
directly attributed to the surrounding pollution in the
environment (e.g., atmospheric and water pollution). Wong
et al. (1993) reported the presence of heavy metals
(cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, nickel, lead,
zinc, and mercury) in 42 Chinese herbal medicines and
attributed their presence to contamination occurring during
air-drying and preservation. Soil condition (e.g., heavily
polluted) also plays a significant role in determining the
heavy metal concentrations of plant materials used for
medicinal purposes (Kabelitz 1998). Januz et al. (1994)
ascertained the contents of heavy metals to be correlated to
industrialized regions, and they concluded that the plants
grown in an industrialized region had higher contents of
heavy metals than plants grown in a second less-
industrialized region. The mineral and heavy metal concentrations reported
herein might not be on par with some of the earlier reports
on medicinal plants. The differences observed might be due
to different growth conditions, genetic factors, geographical
variations in the level of soil fertility, efficiency of mineral
uptake, and the analytical procedures employed (Özcan and
Akgül 1998). From the study, we conclude that measuring minerals
and heavy metal concentrations in nutraceutically valued
plant produce is highly significant not only from nutritional
point of view but also to assess the quality when used as
herbal drugs. The result of the present study provides vital
information on the mineral composition for a few of the
popular and nutraceutically valued plants of India, which
need to be explored further to be used as a food supplement
or for food biofortification to exploit the potential health-
promoting properties.
