There are 230 to 240 known Bidens species. Among them, Bidens pilosa is a representative perennial herb, globally distributed across temperate and tropical regions. B. pilosa has been traditionally used in foods and medicines without obvious adverse effects. Despite significant progress in phytochemical and biological analyses of B. pilosa over the past few years, comprehensive and critical reviews of this plant are anachronistic or relatively limited in scope.The present review aims to summarize up-to-date information on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology of B. pilosa from the literature. In addition to botanical studies and records of the traditional use of B. pilosa in over 40 diseases, scientific studies investigating the potential medicinal uses of this species and its constituent phytochemicals for a variety of disorders are presented and discussed.The structure, bioactivity, and likely mechanisms of action of B. pilosa and its phytochemicals are emphasized. Although some progress has been made, further rigorous efforts are required to investigate the individual compounds isolated from B. pilosa to understand and validate its traditional uses and develop clinical applications.The present review provides preliminary information and gives guidance for further basic and clinical research into this plant. 1. Introduction The United Nations World Health Organization estimates that as many as 5.6 billion people, 80% of the world popu- lation, utilize herbal medicine for primary health care [1].1 Plants have formed the foundation of complicated traditional medicine systems for thousands of years. Medicinal herbs are applied to treat a wide range of disease categories. The first written documentation of the use of medicinal herbs dates from the 26th century BCE in Mesopotamia, and the first record of the use of medicinal herbs by the Egyptians and Greeks dates from 18th century BCE and the 5th century BCE, respectively. Starting around the 11th century BCE, the Chinese and Indians started to develop herbal medicine systems, Chinese herbal medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine, respectively, that continue to be widely practiced today [2]. Therefore, since antiquity, medicinal herbs have played a prominent role in human health. B. pilosa is an easy-to-grow herb that is widely distributed all over the world. It is considered to be a rich source of food and medicine for humans and animals [3, 4]. There is increasing global interest in the use of B. pilosa as shown by the many studies conducted on the plant in recent years. The folkloric use of B. pilosa has been recorded in America, Africa, Asia, andOceania [5]. To explore the potential clinical application of B. pilosa, it is important to link its traditional use with rigorous evidence-based scientific study.The present review focuses on recent studies on the botany, traditional 2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 1: Taxonomy of B. pilosa [6].

The information provided here highlights the pos- sible usefulness of B. pilosa and its isolated compounds and offers insights into possible future research directions. Studies of B. pilosa are divided into three groups: (1) the botany, ethnomedical uses, plant chemistry, pharmacology, and biosafety of B. pilosa; (2) scientific studies that validate the ethnomedical uses ofB. pilosa; and (3) the therapeutic and future research potential of B. pilosa. 1.1. Botany. B. pilosa was first collected and named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 [3]. Taxonomically, it is assigned to the Bidens genus (Asteraceae) as shown in Table 1. This genus is estimated to include 230 to 240 species worldwide [3, 4]. B. pilosa has several varieties such as B. pilosa var. radiata, var. minor, var. pilosa, and var. bisetosa. Alongside examination of morphological traits, authentication of B. pilosa can be aided by chemotaxonomy and molecular characterization [8]. B. pilosa is an erect, perennial herb widely distributed across temperate and tropical regions. B. pilosa is either glabrous or hairy, with green opposite leaves that are serrate, lobed, or dissected. It has white or yellow flowers, and long narrow ribbed black achenes (seeds). It grows to an average height of 60 cm and a maximum of 150 cm in favorable environments [9] (Figure 1). B. pilosa prefers full sun and moderately dry soil. However, it can grow in arid and barren land from low to high elevations. With the advantage of being fast-growing, in the 1970s, the Food and Agricultural Organization actively promoted the cultivation of B. pilosa in Africa [10]. B. pilosa propagates via seeds. A single plant can produce 3000-6000 seeds. Dry mature seeds from B. pilosa can be germinated in 3 to 4 days in moist soil or after being soaking in water. Seeds are viable for at least 3 years [11]. Minimal agricultural techniques are required for B. pilosa cultivation. Due to its invasive tendencies, B. pilosa is generally considered to be a weed [12]. B. pilosa is thought to have originated in South America and subsequently spread all over the world [13]. Bidens species and their varieties bear vernacular names based on their characteristics. For example, Bidens species are known by such names as Spanish needles, beggar's ticks, devil's needles, cobbler's pegs, broom stick, pitchforks, and farmers' friends in English and some other languages because of their sticky achenes [9] and are sometimes known as xian feng cao ("all bountiful grass") in Chinese because of their prosperous growth. 1.2. Traditional Uses. B. pilosa is used as an herb and as an ingredient in teas or herbal medicines. Its shoots and leaves, dried or fresh, are utilized in sauces and teas [14, 15]. In the 1970s, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) promoted the cultivation of B. pilosa in Africa because it is easy to grow, edible, palatable, and safe [7]. The nutritional value of B. pilosa is shown in Table 2. All parts of B. pilosa plant, the whole plant, the aerial parts (leaves, flowers, seeds, and stems), and/or the roots, fresh or dried, are used as ingredients in folk medicines. It is frequently prepared as a dry powder, decoction, maceration or tincture [16]. Generally, this plant is applied as dry powder or tincture when used externally, and as a powder, maceration, or decoction when used as an internal remedy [15]. As summarized in Table 3, B. pilosa, either as a whole plant or different parts, has been reported to be useful in the treatment of more than 40 disorders such as inflamma- tion, immunological disorders, digestive disorders, infectious diseases, cancers, metabolic syndrome, wounds, and many others [26-29]. B. pilosa is usually ingested; however, it can also be utilized externally. For instance, fresh B. pilosa is used to treat snake bites and wounds [23], and in Trinidad and Tobago the aqueous solution of the leaves of B. pilosa is used to bathe babies and children [22]. B. pilosa is sometimes used alone; it is also used as an ingredient in medicinal mixtures together with other medicinal plants such as Aloe vera, Plectranthus mollis, Valeriana officinalis, andCissus sicyoides among others [17, 18, 20, 25]. Whether the commonly used mixtures of B. pilosa, or the mixtures of the compounds found in B. pilosa afford synergistic effects is not yet clear and needs to be verified by further studies. However, one study has suggested that B. pilosa varieties share similar phytochemical compositions and may be substituted for each other [8]. 2. Phytochemicals Interest in basic research and application of B. pilosa has increased since its first identification in 1753. This is mainly due to its wide application in medicines, foods, and drinks. Around 116 publications have documented the exploitation and medical use of B. pilosa. To date, 201 compounds comprising 70 aliphatics, 60 flavonoids, 25 terpenoids, 19 phenylpropanoids, 13 aromatics, 8 porphyrins, and 6 other compounds, have been identified from this plant as compiled previously [30]. The structures of these compounds are pre- sented in Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, respectively. However, the association between B. pilosa phytochemicals and their bioactivities is not yet fully established and should become a future research focus. In the present review, we explore possible associations (Table 11), describe the importance of the known compounds in relation to their biological activity Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 Table 2: Nutritional facts about B. pilosa, courtesy of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization [7].

Com- pelling evidence suggests that the various diverse bioactivities reported for B. pilosa reflect its phytochemical complexity. B. pilosa is an extraordinary source of phytochemicals, particularly flavonoids and polyynes. Plant flavonoids are commonly reported to possess anticancer, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and other bioactivities. However, the bioactivi- ties of only seven of the 60 flavonoids present in B. pilosa have been studied.The bioactivities of the remaining 53 flavonoids are poorly understood and deserve further investigation. Other classes of compounds found inB. pilosa are also in need of further examination, as shown in Table 11. 3. Pharmacological Properties As outlined in Table 3, B. pilosa is traditionally used to treat a wide variety of ailments. Different preparations of its whole plant and/or parts have been purported to treat over 40 categories of illnesses. Scientific studies, although not extensive, have demonstrated that B. pilosa extracts and/or compounds have antitumor [43, 69, 77-83], antiinflamma- tory [27, 75, 79, 84-88], antidiabetic and antihyperglycemic [8, 24, 49, 51, 53], antioxidant [70, 89, 90], immunomodu- latory [50, 69], antimalarial [47, 77], antibacterial [47, 91, 92], antifungal [92, 93], antihypertensive, vasodilatory [28, 94], and antiulcerative [26] activities.

AntiCancer Activity. Folkloric reports revealed the pos- sible antitumor efficacy of B. pilosa, and several scientific in2 vitro studies have supported the claim that B. pilosa extracts and isolated compounds possess anti-cancer activities against a variety of cancer cells. Several studies have used bioassay guided isolation and fractionation methods to discover new compounds from B. pilosa. For example, Kviecinski and colleagues tested hydroalcoholic crude extracts, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions for anti-tumor activity [82]. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was assessed using brine shrimp, hemolytic, MTT, and neutral red uptake (NRU) assays. In vivo studies were performed using Ehrlich ascites carcinoma in isogenic BALB/c mice.
