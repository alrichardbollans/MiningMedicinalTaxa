DET could induce ROS in breast cancer cells which became the upstream stimulus for the formation of centrosomal ubiquitinated protein aggregates and the 12 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity induction of protein carbonylation that might subsequently restrict cancer cell motility [63]. DET was also observed to activate ER stress- and JNK pathway-mediated apoptosis in mammary carcinoma cells triggered by ROS [62]. However, it is not yet clear whether DET caused oxidative DNAdamage through the involvement of transitionmetals. Illustration that the anticancer activity of DET, the same as artemisinin, is through its role as a pro-oxidant suggests that pro-oxidant intervention using SLsmay constitute a promising anticancer strategy. 3.4. Cancer-Associated Transition Metals in Phytochemical- Mediated Redox Regulation. Several essential transition met- als, such as zinc, iron, copper, cobalt, and manganese, are known to regulate various metabolic and signaling path- ways. For example, iron is an essential element in oxygen transportation [143] while copper is an essential component of several antioxidant enzymes [144]. In cancer cells, high metal ion concentration is one factor that contributes to the observed high base level of oxidative stress, which raises the possibility of killing cancer cells by dosing with metal supplements [145]. However, the prooxidant effect of metal ions is also known to initiate carcinogenesis [30], which raises concerns about applying metal supplementation as a therapeutic strategy against cancer. However, some studies indicated that cancer cells are prone to proliferate in envi- ronments with high levels of copper and iron and therefore suggested that these ions maybe be functionally involved in carcinogenesis [146, 147]. In a national cohort of the United States adults, serum concentrations of iron and copper were shown to correlate with mortality rate in cancer patients [148]. Due to the significant role of these metal ions in cancer epidemiology, their levels in different cancers were reviewed by Gupte and Mumper [145]. In comparison to normal individuals, the Cu (Zn, Se, Fe) ratios are usually higher in patients suffering from breast [149], cervical [150], ovarian [150], lung [151], prostate [152], bladder [153], and stomach cancer [154], and leukemia [155]. Increased levels of copper have also recently been correlated with poor survival in breast cancer patients [156].Themajormetal ion contained in chromatin, copper is closely associated with the DNA bases, especially guanine [157]. As one of the redox active metals, copper can directly catalyze the formation of ROS via the Fenton reaction and cause oxidative stress in the cells [158]. The intracellular level of transition metal ions can determine whether phytoantioxidants act as cytoprotective antioxidants or cytotoxic prooxidants. Figure 7 summarizes the current understanding of the interplay between phytoagents and transition metal ions and the antioxidant/pro-oxidant role switch of phytoagents in response to the level of metal ions. The level of transition metal ions determines whether a phytoagent ultimately functions as cytoprotective antioxidant or cytotoxic pro-oxidant. Under normal level of transition metal ions, phytoantioxidants serve as radical scavengers and Nrf2/ARE activators that confer a cytoprotective effect that can be applied in chemoprevention. When the level of intracellular transition metal ion is high, such as in cancer cells, phytoagents recycle the metal ions and thus facilitate ROS production through the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions. Otherwise, metal ions catalyze the cleavage of phytoagents and generate radical cleavage products that can cause ROS. Such a prooxidant effect further drives the redox-sensitive cancer cells to their antioxidant limit and leads to cytotoxicity that can be applied as a chemotherapeutic strategy. On the other hand, metal-chelating phytoagents reduce metal ion levels and thus block the ROS producing Fenton(-like) reaction and provide a cytoprotective effect. 3.4.1. Ion Chelation by Phytoagents. Increasing numbers of studies are evaluating the antioxidant properties of phyto- chemicals through assessment of their ability to chelate metal ions that lead to attenuated reactivity of free radicals. Water extracts of pine needles inhibited oxidative DNA damage probably due to their stronghydroxyl radical and intracellular ROS scavenging activity and the chelating action of the iron (Fe2+) ion [159]. Antioxidant activity was reported for lunasin, a novel preventive peptide purified from Solanum nigrum L, which is also found in soy, barley, and wheat. The peptide did not scavenge endogenous hydroxyl radicals but inhibited the Fenton reaction by chelating iron ions, thus protecting DNA from oxidative damage [160]. The antioxidant properties of phenolic compounds are clear; however, the contribution of metal ion chelation to the antioxidative effect of these compounds is not yet conclusive. One study showed that the orthodihydroxy polyphenols bear- ing catechol or galloyl groups exhibit strong metal chelating activity [161]. In the study by Andjelkovic and colleagues, the ability of the phenolic compounds which chelate iron was ranked based on iron binding constants in ascending order. Protocatechuic acid was the weakest chelator, followed by hydroxytyrosol, gallic acid, and caffeic acid, with chlorogenic acid as the strongest chelator [162]. Iron chelation by phenolic compounds, phytochemicals in pine needle extracts, or by the peptide lunasin, which subsequently inhibited DNA oxidation, may deserve further exploration for their potential in cancer prevention. The reactivity of metal ions can be attenuated indi- rectly through inhibition of their transportation. Dihy- droartemisinin was reported to decrease iron uptake and disturb iron homeostasis in cancer cells through down regulating cell-surface transferrin receptor-1, which may be a novel mechanism of dihydroartemisinin independent of oxidative damage that has been previously mentioned as anticancer property of artemisinin [163]. The disturbance of iron homeostasis in cancer cells via irondepletion by natural or synthetic iron chelators has recently been shown to inhibit tumor growth by therapeutically manipulating iron level [164]. The effect of phytocompounds on deregulation of reactive ion metabolism in tumor cells is worth further exploration. It is interesting to note that a prokaryotic glutathione analog, namely, ergothioneine, can protect cells from oxida- tive damage as measured by 4-HNE and partially rescue cell death caused by irradiation [165]. Another report showed that ergothioneine forms a chelation complex with copper and therefore protects cells from copper-induced DNA damage [166].

The level of transition metal ions determines whether a phyto-antioxidant ultimately functions as cytoprotective antioxidant or cytotoxic prooxidant. Under normal levels of transition metal ions, phytoantioxidants serve as radical scavengers and Nrf2/ARE activators that confer a cytoprotective effect that can be applied in chemoprevention. When the level of intracellular transition metal ion is high, such as in cancer cells, phytoantioxidants recycle the metal ions and thus facilitate ROS production through the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions.

On the other hand, metal-chelating phytoagents reduce metal ion levels and thus block the ROS producing Fenton(-like) reaction and provide a cytoprotective effect. 3.4.2. Transition Metal-Mediated Prooxidant Properties of Phytochemicals in Anticancer Activity. Under certaincon- ditions, antioxidants can act as prooxidants [167]. Caffeic acid produces hydrogen peroxide which is activated by transition metals to cause oxidative DNA damage in vitro and in cultured human cells in the presence of Mn(II) or Cu(II) [168]. In another study using DNA fragments isolated from the human p53 gene, quercetin increased 8-oxoG levelsignificantly in the presence of copper ions (Cu2+), whereas 8-oxoG formation by kaempferol or luteolin was insignificant [169]. These early studies raised concern about whether ingestion of these phytochemicals may lead to increased risk of cancer. Lately, rats treated with 7,12- dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) have become a widely usedmodel formammary carcinogenesis and in recent study, dietary supplementation with copper alone or together with the grape polyphenol resveratrol was found to promote carcinogenesis through increased frequency of microsatellite instability [170]. Later, a similar result was observed in the DMBA-model treated with combined supplementation with zinc ions and resveratrol [171]. However, a different mecha- nism was reported for resveratrol action in another cancer model with different stage of carcinogenesis. Resveratrol and its derivatives increase copper-mediated oxidative DNA damage by their pro-oxidant properties coupled with higher apoptosis induction in human leukemia cell lines [172]. The well-known antioxidant vitamin C, for example, was also found to act as a pro-oxidant in vitro when mixed with transition metal ions [173]. In healthy humans, Rehman and colleagues observed an increased level of oxidative DNA damage after 6-week supplementation of a mixture of ferrous sulphate andvitamin C, suggesting that this combination acts as a pro-oxidant; however, a longer period of sup- plementation by 12 weeks did not show significant effect [174]. Intriguingly, catalytic therapy that involves hydroxyl radical induction through a redox active mixture of vitamin C/medicinal herbal extracts and copper has been employed to improve the treatment of cancer patients [175, 176]. The Bhat group that established a model that involves human peripheral lymphocytes and comet assay carried out a series of studies on plant-derived polyphenolic antioxidants and proved that the mechanism is not restricted to vitamin C [177-179]. The most recent finding from the group is that the polyphenolic compound gossypol from the cotton plant and its derivative apogossypolone also cause oxidative damage to DNA by mobilizing endogenous copper in lymphocytes [180]. Although the reported mechanism was mainly the result obtained from lymphocytes; nevertheless, it could 14 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity PAPA PA PA PARP Protein denaturation Protein carboxylation Sulfhydrate disulfide bond TRX GPx PRX GPx PRX Lipid peroxidation MDA Oxidative DNA damage 8-oxoG Indirect SSB Mutation BER Translesion repair Cell death Genome instability Mutation PCNA Translesion DNA synthesis GPx GR TRR TRX PRX GSS GSH GSH GSSG CATSOD Fenton reaction GPx OncogenesisPA PA Nrf2/ARE O2 + e - + 2 2H2O2 2H2O2 + e - Fe2+ Fe3+ PA Phytoagents Prooxidant role Antioxidant role Inhibition OH + OH- H+ O + O2 Figure 8: Summary of mechanisms of action of phytoagents in chemoprevention and chemotherapeutics through modulating oxidative stress. In the presence of ferrous ions (or other transition metal ions), phytoagents recycle the metal ion and thus promote the Fenton reaction that generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide. Such prooxidant effects of phytoagents in the presence of metal ion can overwrite their cytoprotective roles because the production of ROS may be faster than the induction of antioxidant defense. Hydrogen peroxide imposes oxidative damage on biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and DNA, and leads to protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, and DNA base oxidation, which can be prevented by phytoantioxidants. Phytoantioxidants can activate Nrf2/ARE signaling and thus transcriptionally upregulate a panel of antioxidant genes that can provide further antioxidant capacity. Glutathione synthetase (GSS) can raise the level of glutathione (GSH) which can reduce oxidative damage by scavenging hydroxyl radicals, which otherwise cause oxidative DNA damage and increase the chance of point mutation and genome instability during the DNA repair process while glutathione reductase (GR) recycles the oxidized form of GSH and maintains the level of the reduced form of GSH. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxin (TRX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX) can prevent oxidative insults on proteins and lipids. imply the anticancer property of polyphenols based on the abundant copper detected in different types of tumors [145, 153]. The enhanced electron transfer between transi- tion metals and phytochemicals probably occurs in cancer cells with higher levels of copper ions, which may induce ROS generation subsequently leading to DNA damage [178, 180]. However, the mixture of a polyphenol and a transition metal was shown to promote tumor growth in mice with carcinogen induction that mimics the process of cancer initiation [170, 171]. These studies raise concerns about the potential carcinogenic activities of phytoagents. It is not clear whether the mixture of antioxidant phytochemical and transition metal resembles the oxidative stress that could possibly initiate tumorigenesis in normal cells, but that such a prooxidant effect drives the redox-sensitive cancer cells to their antioxidant limit and leads to cytotoxicity that has been applied in catalytic therapy.More studies are required to clarify the interaction of phytoagents and redox active metals as their oxidative potential may initiate tumors in a healthy individual. 4. Future Prospects This review provides updated and integrative information about the regulation of nucleic acid oxidation by phytoagents in cancer. Animalmodels and human epidemiological studies have revealed that phytochemicals prevent carcinogenesis through direct ROS scavenging or induction of cellular antioxidant defense systems that consist of detoxifying enzymes, defense machinery mediated by Nrf2-antioxidative stress, and inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways that together protect cells fromDNAdamage by ROS and reactive metabolites of carcinogens [42, 57, 58] (Figure 8). Inves- tigation of oxidative modulation of proteins and lipids as well as DNA by phytochemicals provides a comprehensive picture of their functions as redox regulators in cancer. In general, antioxidant phytoagents are potentially useful in cancer prevention because they can protect healthy cells from oxidative DNA damage through radical scavenging, antiox- idant defense system stimulation, and metal ion chelation; prooxidant phytoagents, on the other hand, are particu- larly effective in treating aggressive tumors with abnormally Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 15 radical-reactive cellular environments by exceeding the limit of oxidative stress that can be tolerated by tumor cells. Cancer cells, in general, have a higher basal redox level due to either defects in antioxidant defense or increased production of ROS during oncogenic transformation [122, 126]. Therefore, when challenged with similar quantities of ROS, cancer cells fail to buffer/clear excessive ROS and cell death ensues. In contrast, normal cells with lower redox levels are capable of buffering/clearing ROS by inducible antioxidant defense regulated by Nrf2/ARE signaling and are thus protected from cell death. Recently, dietary levels of phytochemicals have been suggested to trigger induction of low levels of oxidative stress that may "prime" cellular antioxidant defense systems to resist higher level of oxidative insults, thus offering greater protection against carcinogenic insult [60]. However, several studies have also hinted at a "dark" side of these cell-protective mechanisms. For example, the cytotoxicity of the anticancer drug platinum was attenuated by base excision repair of ROS-induced formation of 8-oxoG, indicating that repairing genotoxic damage could contribute to multidrug resistance of cancer cells [181]. Restoration of glutathione level by overexpression of -glutamylcysteine synthetase was found to prevent DNA damage and subse- quent apoptosis caused by genotoxic agents in a resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line [182]. Overexpression of catalase was found to cause drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines in chemotherapy [183]. These findings imply that alteration of the expression of antioxidant enzymes could be a mechanism through which cancer-cell resistance to redox- based chemotherapeutic agents is promoted. On the other hand, several phytochemicals have been indicated to upreg- ulate the Nrf2 pathway which stimulates the defense system and leads to cancer prevention. However, overexpression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes was also observed in several cancer cell lines and human tumors, rendering cancer cells at an advantage for survival and unlimited proliferation. In addition, increased Nrf2 activity was found in some resistant cancer cells; in other words, to overcome chemoresistance in tumors, the Nrf2 pathway has to be deregulated [184]. There- fore, sophisticated design is necessary and caution has to be taken when administrating and handling Nrf2-dependent (as discussed above) phytochemicals in cancer patients, given that transformed cancer cells that are "overprotected" by antioxidants could possibly develop drug resistance. Nrf2 is one of the key players in phytoagent-mediated antioxidant defensewhose activation confers a chemopreven- tive effect. However, recent studies indicate that Nrf2 itself also plays a double-bladed-sword role in cancer manage- ment [185]. On one hand, Nrf2 orchestrates gene expression that protects cells from oxidative damage and detoxifies xenobiotics; on the other hand, the same effects confer chemoresistance to cancer cells.
