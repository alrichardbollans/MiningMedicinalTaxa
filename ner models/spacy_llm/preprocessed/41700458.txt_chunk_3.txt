Many conven-
tional anticancer drugs including vinblastine, doxorubicin,
campthotecin, cisplatin, and inostamycin have been reported
to activate a caspase-3(-like) protease causing generation of

presumably through the activation of NADPH oxidase
that subsequently induces apoptosis in cancer cells [125]. Intriguingly, cancer cells are frequently deficient in crucial
antioxidative enzymes, such as catalase, GPx, and SOD, and
therefore demonstrate a high vulnerability to ROS. One
antitumor strategy is to deliver excess oxidative stress into
tumor cells or to target the disruption of the antioxidative
defense systems of tumor cells.This strategy has been termed
‚Äúoxidation therapy‚Äù in cancer treatment [126]. Several studies
have reported that certain dietary anticancer/cancer preven-
tive agents cause generation of ROS specifically in tumor cells,
not in normal cells [56, 127, 128].Through adaptation, normal
cells that are exposed to pro-oxidant chemopreventive agents
which generate oxidative stress can acquire resistance to
transformation via adjusting the normal redox tone of these
cells. In contrast, transformed cells, which typically endure
an oxidizing intracellular environment, would ultimately
succumb due to an excess of ROS caused by the same agent. ROS and cellular redox tone are exploitable targets in cancer
chemoprevention via the stimulation of cytoprotection in
normal cells and/or the induction of apoptosis in malignant
cells [129]. Dietary intake of such chemopreventive agents
could be a prefect strategy to achieve this purpose. (a) Sulfur-Containing Compounds. Diallyl disulfide (DADS)
and diallyltrisulfide (DATS) which are found in abun-
dance in garlic are among the dietary factors studied
extensively for their anticancer action involving induction
of oxidative stress in the human body, as reviewed else-
where [130]. The pro-oxidant and thiol-adducting activ-
ities of these electrophilic organosulfur compounds are
attributed to their reactive isothiocyanate (R‚ÄìN=C=S) phar-
macophore. Dietary isothiocyanates include sulforaphane,
phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), benzyl-isothiocyanate,
and 6-methylsulfinylhexyl-isothiocyanate (Figure 6). Origi-
nally, copper-mediated oxidative DNA damage induced by
these isothiocyanates was considered to be carcinogenic [131];
however, later studies demonstrated that these phytochem-
icals exhibit preferential cytostaticity in premalignant and
tumor cells via their pleiotropic pro-oxidant activities as
reviewed elsewhere [106]. (b) Curcumin. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) from turmeric,
like isothiocyanates, is a pleiotropic redox modulator that is
involved in multiple cellular activities as a pro/antioxidant
and metal chelator, as recently reviewed [59]. Curcumin,
which contains an electrophilic Michael acceptor as an active
moiety, can also mediate strand scission of DNA in the
presence of Cu (II) [132].The compelling anticancer activities
of curcumin have been widely demonstrated across different
cancer cell lines and animal systems, as a function of above-
mentioned reactive pharmacophores targeting various cellu-
lar molecules. Currently, the cancer preventive/therapeutic
potential of curcumin, as single or combinatorial agent, is
under evaluation in various clinical trials, including multiple
myeloma, rectal cancer, metastatic colon cancer, advanced
osteosarcoma, and pancreatic cancer [59]. (c) Sesquiterpene Lactones. The sesquiterpene lactones (SLs)
have also gained considerable attention for their effective-
ness in treating inflammation, headaches, infections, and
other human diseases. SLs contain Michael acceptors that
act as electrophiles that can increase cellular ROS and
modulate specific redox sensitive targets in cancer cells. Artemisinin and parthenolide (Figure 6) are SL-derived
drugs now being evaluated in cancer clinical trials [133‚Äì
138]. Artemisinin, isolated from Artemisia annua (qinhao,
sweet wormwood), possesses an endoperoxide bridge in the
reactive pharmacophore that can be activated and cleaved
by endogenous ions, leading to the generation of radical
species and ROS through the Fenton reaction, which was
observed to be a common mechanism underlying both the
antimalarial and anticancer activities of the compound [139]. Parthenolide, identified from feverfew (Tanacetum parthe-
nium), contains an electrophilic ùõº-methylene-ùõæ-lactone as
the active moiety underlying its anticancer activity related to
the Michael acceptor electrophile [66, 67]. Phytochemicals
with prooxidant properties such as the SLs with Michael
acceptor electrophiles have the potential to sensitize tumors
in cancer treatment. For example, concurrent delivery of
the SL parthenolide and the clinical drug paclitaxel in
mixed micelles greatly improved the therapeutic response of
resistant lung cancer cell lines to paclitaxel treatment [140]. In
a mouse peritoneal dissemination model, parthenolide also
improved the chemosensitivity of paclitaxel against gastric
cancer through deregulation of theNF-ùúÖB signalling pathway
[141]. Nevertheless, parthenolide and dehydrocostus lactone
can also suppress cancer cell activity through downregulating
other molecular targets, such as mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C, and induction of c-Jun-
N-termial kinase (JNK) [142]. In our laboratory, we identified a germacranolide SL
deoxyelephantopin (DET) from a medicinal plant Elephan-
topus scaber (Asteraceas) which contains an ùõº-methylene-ùõæ-
lactone, an ùõº,ùõΩ-unsaturated lactone and a methacrylate ester
side chain [62]. DET could induce ROS in breast cancer
cells which became the upstream stimulus for the formation
of centrosomal ubiquitinated protein aggregates and the
12 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
induction of protein carbonylation that might subsequently
restrict cancer cell motility [63]. DET was also observed to
activate ER stress- and JNK pathway-mediated apoptosis in
mammary carcinoma cells triggered by ROS [62]. However,
it is not yet clear whether DET caused oxidative DNAdamage
through the involvement of transitionmetals. Illustration that
the anticancer activity of DET, the same as artemisinin, is
through its role as a pro-oxidant suggests that pro-oxidant
intervention using SLsmay constitute a promising anticancer
strategy. 3.4. Cancer-Associated Transition Metals in Phytochemical-
Mediated Redox Regulation. Several essential transition met-
als, such as zinc, iron, copper, cobalt, and manganese, are
known to regulate various metabolic and signaling path-
ways. For example, iron is an essential element in oxygen
transportation [143] while copper is an essential component
of several antioxidant enzymes [144]. In cancer cells, high
metal ion concentration is one factor that contributes to the
observed high base level of oxidative stress, which raises
the possibility of killing cancer cells by dosing with metal
supplements [145]. However, the prooxidant effect of metal
ions is also known to initiate carcinogenesis [30], which
raises concerns about applying metal supplementation as a
therapeutic strategy against cancer. However, some studies
indicated that cancer cells are prone to proliferate in envi-
ronments with high levels of copper and iron and therefore
suggested that these ions maybe be functionally involved in
carcinogenesis [146, 147]. In a national cohort of the United
States adults, serum concentrations of iron and copper were
shown to correlate with mortality rate in cancer patients
[148]. Due to the significant role of these metal ions in cancer
epidemiology, their levels in different cancers were reviewed
by Gupte and Mumper [145]. In comparison to normal
individuals, the Cu (Zn, Se, Fe) ratios are usually higher in
patients suffering from breast [149], cervical [150], ovarian
[150], lung [151], prostate [152], bladder [153], and stomach
cancer [154], and leukemia [155]. Increased levels of copper
have also recently been correlated with poor survival in
breast cancer patients [156].Themajormetal ion contained in
chromatin, copper is closely associated with the DNA bases,
especially guanine [157]. As one of the redox active metals,
copper can directly catalyze the formation of ROS via the
Fenton reaction and cause oxidative stress in the cells [158]. The intracellular level of transition metal ions can determine
whether phytoantioxidants act as cytoprotective antioxidants
or cytotoxic prooxidants. Figure 7 summarizes the current
understanding of the interplay between phytoagents and
transition metal ions and the antioxidant/pro-oxidant role
switch of phytoagents in response to the level of metal ions. The level of transition metal ions determines whether a
phytoagent ultimately functions as cytoprotective antioxidant
or cytotoxic pro-oxidant. Under normal level of transition
metal ions, phytoantioxidants serve as radical scavengers
and Nrf2/ARE activators that confer a cytoprotective effect
that can be applied in chemoprevention. When the level of
intracellular transition metal ion is high, such as in cancer
cells, phytoagents recycle the metal ions and thus facilitate
ROS production through the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions. Otherwise, metal ions catalyze the cleavage of phytoagents
and generate radical cleavage products that can cause ROS. Such a prooxidant effect further drives the redox-sensitive
cancer cells to their antioxidant limit and leads to cytotoxicity
that can be applied as a chemotherapeutic strategy. On
the other hand, metal-chelating phytoagents reduce metal
ion levels and thus block the ROS producing Fenton(-like)
reaction and provide a cytoprotective effect. 3.4.1. Ion Chelation by Phytoagents. Increasing numbers of
studies are evaluating the antioxidant properties of phyto-
chemicals through assessment of their ability to chelate metal
ions that lead to attenuated reactivity of free radicals. Water
extracts of pine needles inhibited oxidative DNA damage
probably due to their stronghydroxyl radical and intracellular
ROS scavenging activity and the chelating action of the
iron (Fe2+) ion [159]. Antioxidant activity was reported for
lunasin, a novel preventive peptide purified from Solanum
nigrum L, which is also found in soy, barley, and wheat. The peptide did not scavenge endogenous hydroxyl radicals
but inhibited the Fenton reaction by chelating iron ions,
thus protecting DNA from oxidative damage [160]. The
antioxidant properties of phenolic compounds are clear;
however, the contribution of metal ion chelation to the
antioxidative effect of these compounds is not yet conclusive. One study showed that the orthodihydroxy polyphenols bear-
ing catechol or galloyl groups exhibit strong metal chelating
activity [161]. In the study by Andjelkovic and colleagues, the
ability of the phenolic compounds which chelate iron was
ranked based on iron binding constants in ascending order. Protocatechuic acid was the weakest chelator, followed by
hydroxytyrosol, gallic acid, and caffeic acid, with chlorogenic
acid as the strongest chelator [162]. Iron chelation by phenolic
compounds, phytochemicals in pine needle extracts, or by
the peptide lunasin, which subsequently inhibited DNA
oxidation, may deserve further exploration for their potential
in cancer prevention. The reactivity of metal ions can be attenuated indi-
rectly through inhibition of their transportation. Dihy-
droartemisinin was reported to decrease iron uptake and
disturb iron homeostasis in cancer cells through down
regulating cell-surface transferrin receptor-1, which may be
a novel mechanism of dihydroartemisinin independent of
oxidative damage that has been previously mentioned as
anticancer property of artemisinin [163]. The disturbance
of iron homeostasis in cancer cells via irondepletion by
natural or synthetic iron chelators has recently been shown
to inhibit tumor growth by therapeutically manipulating iron
level [164]. The effect of phytocompounds on deregulation
of reactive ion metabolism in tumor cells is worth further
exploration. It is interesting to note that a prokaryotic glutathione
analog, namely, ergothioneine, can protect cells from oxida-
tive damage as measured by 4-HNE and partially rescue cell
death caused by irradiation [165]. Another report showed that
ergothioneine forms a chelation complex with copper and
therefore protects cells from copper-induced DNA damage
[166]. Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 13

Figure 7: Role switches under different conditions‚Äîphytoagents function as both antioxidants and prooxidants in concert with transition
metal ions. The level of transition metal ions determines whether a phyto-antioxidant ultimately functions as cytoprotective antioxidant or
cytotoxic prooxidant. Under normal levels of transition metal ions, phytoantioxidants serve as radical scavengers and Nrf2/ARE activators
that confer a cytoprotective effect that can be applied in chemoprevention. When the level of intracellular transition metal ion is high, such
as in cancer cells, phytoantioxidants recycle the metal ions and thus facilitate ROS production through the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions. Otherwise,metal ions catalyze the cleavage of phytoagents and generate radical cleavage products that can cause ROS. Such a prooxidant effect
further drives the redox-sensitive cancer cells to their antioxidant limit and leads to cytotoxicity that can be applied as a chemotherapeutic
strategy. On the other hand, metal-chelating phytoagents reduce metal ion levels and thus block the ROS producing Fenton(-like) reaction
and provide a cytoprotective effect. 3.4.2. Transition Metal-Mediated Prooxidant Properties of
Phytochemicals in Anticancer Activity. Under certaincon-
ditions, antioxidants can act as prooxidants [167]. Caffeic
acid produces hydrogen peroxide which is activated by
transition metals to cause oxidative DNA damage in vitro
and in cultured human cells in the presence of Mn(II)
or Cu(II) [168]. In another study using DNA fragments
isolated from the human p53 gene, quercetin increased
8-oxoG levelsignificantly in the presence of copper ions
(Cu2+), whereas 8-oxoG formation by kaempferol or luteolin
was insignificant [169]. These early studies raised concern
about whether ingestion of these phytochemicals may lead
to increased risk of cancer. Lately, rats treated with 7,12-
dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) have become a widely
usedmodel formammary carcinogenesis and in recent study,
dietary supplementation with copper alone or together with
the grape polyphenol resveratrol was found to promote
carcinogenesis through increased frequency of microsatellite
instability [170]. Later, a similar result was observed in the
DMBA-model treated with combined supplementation with
zinc ions and resveratrol [171]. However, a different mecha-
nism was reported for resveratrol action in another cancer
model with different stage of carcinogenesis. Resveratrol
and its derivatives increase copper-mediated oxidative DNA
damage by their pro-oxidant properties coupled with higher
apoptosis induction in human leukemia cell lines [172]. The well-known antioxidant vitamin C, for example, was
also found to act as a pro-oxidant in vitro when mixed with
transition metal ions [173]. In healthy humans, Rehman and
colleagues observed an increased level of oxidative DNA
damage after 6-week supplementation of a mixture of ferrous
sulphate andvitamin C, suggesting that this combination
acts as a pro-oxidant; however, a longer period of sup-
plementation by 12 weeks did not show significant effect
[174]. Intriguingly, catalytic therapy that involves hydroxyl
radical induction through a redox active mixture of vitamin
C/medicinal herbal extracts and copper has been employed
to improve the treatment of cancer patients [175, 176]. The
Bhat group that established a model that involves human
peripheral lymphocytes and comet assay carried out a series
of studies on plant-derived polyphenolic antioxidants and
proved that the mechanism is not restricted to vitamin C
[177‚Äì179]. The most recent finding from the group is that the
polyphenolic compound gossypol from the cotton plant and
its derivative apogossypolone also cause oxidative damage
to DNA by mobilizing endogenous copper in lymphocytes
[180].
