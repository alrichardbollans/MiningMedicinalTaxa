bLE: leaves, ST: stem, FW: flower, WP: whole plant, RT: roots, AP: aerial parts. primary pharmacological properties of B. pilosa extracts and
phytochemicals are presented and discussed. 3.1. AntiCancer Activity. Folkloric reports revealed the pos-
sible antitumor efficacy of B. pilosa, and several scientific in2
vitro studies have supported the claim that B. pilosa extracts
and isolated compounds possess anti-cancer activities against
a variety of cancer cells. Several studies have used bioassay
guided isolation and fractionation methods to discover new
compounds from B. pilosa. For example, Kviecinski and
colleagues tested hydroalcoholic crude extracts, chloroform,
ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions for anti-tumor activity
[82]. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was assessed using
brine shrimp, hemolytic, MTT, and neutral red uptake
(NRU) assays. In vivo studies were performed using Ehrlich
ascites carcinoma in isogenic BALB/c mice. Among them,
