Kumari and colleagues also reported the anti-cancer and anti-malarial activities of B. pilosa leaves [77]. Based on a cytotoxicity- directed fractionation strategy, they identified phenyl-1,3,5- heptatriene with IC 50 values of 8+-0.01, 0.49+-0.45, 0.7+-0.01, and 10 +- 0.01 g/mL against human oral, liver, colon, and breast cancer cell lines, respectively. However, phenyl-1,3,5- heptatriyne showed lower activity against breast cancer cell lines than the chloroform leaf extract which had an IC 50 value of 6.5 +- 0.01 g/mL. Moreover, the positive control, taxol, showed higher activity than phenyl-1,3,5-heptatriyne [77]. Furthermore, in vitro comet assays were performed to evaluate the toxicity of n-hexane, chloroform, and methanol extracts of B. pilosa and its ethyl acetate, acetone, and water fractions onHela andKB cells.The ethyl acetate fraction from the methanol extract exhibited the highest activity with half maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CTC 50 ) of 965.2g/mL and 586.2g/mL against Hela and KB cells, respectively. Despite the moderate toxicity, these findings suggest that these B. pilosa extracts/fractions could be useful for future 12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Ta bl e 5: Fl av on oi ds iso lat ed fro m B. pi lo sa [3 0] .
