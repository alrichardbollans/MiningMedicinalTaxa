Figure 6: Representative phytocompoundswith redox regulation capability.There are fourmajor types of phytocompounds that canmodulate
intracellular redox status: (A) phenolics, (B) terpenes, (C) vitamins, and (D) organosulfides. They show free radical scavenging, Nrf2/ARE
activation, and/or facilitation of ROS production in cancer cells. NADPH: quinone reductase [72]. Some phytoagents without
electrophilic groups could also induce Nrf2, though to a
lesser extent. These types of phytoagents might activate Nrf2
indirectly through modulating signaling pathways whereas
thiol-reactive electrophiles can directly modify the redox-
sensitive cysteine residues in theNrf2/Keap1 complex thereby
promoting the dissociation of the complex and the nuclear
translocation of Nrf2. (d) Attenuation of Inflammation through Inactivation. NF-ùúÖB
is the master transcription factor that governs the expression
of many inflammation-related genes. Notably, the activation
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 9
of NF-ùúÖB is redox-sensitive. High endogenous ROS level
stimulates NF-ùúÖB activation, which then leads to a pro-
inflammatory response and further exacerbates the intracel-
lular redox status [73‚Äì77]. Such a feedback loop mediated
by redox-sensitive NF-ùúÖB activation often leads to chronic
inflammation, one of the hallmarks of cancer. Many phytoa-
gents exhibiting an anti-inflammatory effect have been shown
to efficiently suppress NF-ùúÖB activation. Suppression of NF-
ùúÖB can be achieved by either the aforementioned antioxidant
actions or through direct chemical modification of NF-
ùúÖB redox-sensitive cysteine residues by phytoagents with
electrophilic groups, such as C=O, N=C=S or organosulfide
groups to compromise its ability to translocate to the nucleus
and bind DNA. 3.2.2. Antioxidant Effects and Defense Systems of Selected Phy-
toagents. Vitamins and phenolics (two well-known groups
of antioxidants), as well as electrophilic phytocompounds,
are used below to exemplify the latest developments in the
evaluation of the antioxidant effects and related defense
systems of phytocompounds with a focus on oxidative DNA
damage as a biomarker in cancer prevention. (a) Vitamins. The ability of macronutrients and micronutri-
ents present in fruits and vegetables to reduce the risk of can-
cer is well known. Among these compounds, the antioxidant
vitamins and their precursors have been extensively studied
[15]. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E, and ùõΩ-carotene
are often referred to as ‚Äúantioxidant vitamins.‚Äù Vitamin C
cooperates with vitamin E to generate ùõº-tocopherol from ùõº-
tocopherol radicals in membranes and lipoproteins.Through
working along with other antioxidant enzymes, these antiox-
idants have been suggested to reduce oxidative damage in
humans [78], and thereby minimizing the risk of certain
chronic diseases [79‚Äì81]. However, early epidemiological
studies and clinical trials investigating the efficacy of these
vitamins in affecting disease outcome concluded that there
was insufficient evidence to link supplementation of humans
with vitamin C, vitamin E, or ùõΩ-carotene with a reduction
in in vivo oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, or DNA
based on the measurement of oxidative biomarkers [82]. More recent clinical trials also suggest no correlatable effect
between individual vitamins and chemoprevention [83, 84]. Further, anticancer properties reported for different vitamins
have been discrepant. The history of the most well-known
antioxidant, vitamin C, in cancer treatment is controversial
while vitamins A and E only showed dispensable effects
in tumor elimination [85]. However, the role of vitamin
D in cancer treatment and prevention is promising [86,
87]. Interestingly, a large-scale, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial in male physicians showed that,
compared with placebo, men taking a daily multivitamin
had a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of
total cancer; however, there was no significant effect on some
specific cancer types, such as prostate cancer and colorectal
cancer. It was therefore concluded that ‚Äúdaily multivitamin
supplementation modestly but significantly reduced the risk
of total cancer [88].‚Äù
Recently, in a large cohort studywith 356 healthy subjects,
dietary intake of vitamins was demonstrated to be associated
with reduced levels ofmarkers of DNAdamage and oxidation
(M1dG and 8-oxoG) measured in peripheral white blood
cells. Notably, the associations were stronger in nonsmokers
than in smokers [89]. It is important to keep in mind
that several environmental factors can affect the antioxidant
capacity of these vitamins. Environmental factors such as
smoking and metal intoxication that causes excessive ROS
burden to the body should be avoided, because antioxidant
phytoagents can prevent de novo oxidation to nucleic acid
but are not able to rescue or reverse oxidized nucleic acid
caused by persistent oxidative insults from environmental
stimulation. In another study, the protective effects of vitamin
C and a natural phenol resveratrol on ethanol-induced oxida-
tive DNA damage in human peripheral lymphocytes were
investigated. Resveratrol showed significant DNA protection
in a 24 h experiment, while the protective effect of vitamin
C was seen in only 1 h. Both compounds were shown to
directly scavenge hydroxyl radicals produced during ethanol
metabolism. In addition, resveratrol inhibited dehydrogenase
gene expression and activated the base excision repair (BER)
system, mechanisms whichmay underlie its substantial effect
on DNA protection. Vitamin C, however, showed no effect
on the ethanol metabolic pathway or the BER system [90]. The antioxidant properties of vitamins in comparison to
whole fruits and vegetables as anticancer agents are also of
interest. The effectiveness of kiwifruit in decreasing oxidative
DNA damage was assessed using comet assay (single-cell gel
electrophoresis) tomeasure damage to lymphocytes collected
from a human trial in which subjects drank kiwifruit juice. It was observed that a simple extract of kiwifruit was more
effective than a solution of vitamin C in protecting DNA
from damage in vitro [91]. This study demonstrated that the
significant antioxidant activity of kiwifruit ex vivo and in vitro
is not attributable entirely to vitamin C contained in the fruit. Instead, other components like phenolics and vitamin E may
also contribute to the antioxidant effect of kiwi fruit extract
[92]. These studies suggest an undetermined role of vitamin
C present in fresh fruits, although different vitamin C content
present in kiwifruit extractmight result in different protective
effects. (b) Phenolics. Phenolic compounds are present in high con-
centrations in many components of the so-called ‚ÄúMediter-
ranean diet,‚Äù including fruit and vegetables. These com-
pounds seem to scavenge ROS, resulting in protection against
oxidative DNA. This assumption was verified by testing the
effect of Mediterranean plant extracts (Crepis vesicaria L,
Origanumheracleoticum, Scandix australis L,Amaranthus sp.,
Scolymus hispanicus L, and Thymus piperella L) on oxidative
DNA damage induced in lymphocytes by H
2

in relation to
their polyphenolic content using comet assay [93].This study
revealed that the protection of DNA by phenols present in
Mediterranean plants is only partly due to ROS scavenging
properties. Phenols can also attenuate Fenton(-like) reac-
tions through metal ion chelation and induce endogenous
antioxidant defense through Nrf2 activation. Apparently,
ROS scavenging only partially contributes to antioxidant
10 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
activity of Mediterranean diet-derived phenolics or other
phytochemicals. Their protection against oxidative DNA
may involve other redox regulation such as upregulation of
antioxidant enzymes in cells and attenuation of Fenton(-like)
reaction by metal ion chelation. In the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
oxidative stress is a major predisposing condition which is
relevant to the development and progression of the cancer. In search for a dietary chemopreventive approach for the
lethal HCC, pomegranate, an ancient fruit has gained atten-
tion owing to its significant antioxidant properties mainly
contributed by the anthocyanins and ellagic acid derivatives
[94, 95]. Pomegranate emulsion, a proprietary combination
of aqueous phase extract and pomegranate seed oil contain-
ing several polyphenolic compounds, mixed with octadeca-
trienoic acids, sterols, steroids, and ùõæ-tocopherol, was found
to prevent hepatocarcinogenesis through induction of Nrf2-
regulated phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing genes such as
several GST isozymes that are involved in antagonizing
oxidative stress [96]. A similar Nrf2-mediated antioxidant
effect was also observed in HCC rats treated with blackcur-
rant anthocyanins [97]. Flavonoids are naturally occurring diphenylpropanoids
that appear in animal and human cells following consump-
tion of vegetables, fruits, and beverages such as tea and
wine. Flavonoids can be classified into six major subgroups:
flavonols (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol), flavones (e.g., api-
genin, luteolin), flavanones (e.g., hesperidin, naringenin),
flavan-3-ols (e.g., catechin, theaflavin, and gallic esters of
catechin and theaflavins), anthocyanidins (e.g., pelargonidin,
cyanidin), and isoflavones (e.g., genistein, daidzein). Epi-
demiological studies suggest that dietary intake of flavonoids
may reduce the risk of tumors of the breast, colon, lung,
prostate, and pancreas. However, the generalizability of these
anticancer effects remains a subject of study [98]. (c) Electrophilic Phytochemicals. Electrophilic phytochemi-
cals, such as phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC), sulforaphane
(SFN), turmeric, curcumin, and EGCG, prevent oxidative
modification and mutation of genes through activation of
the Nrf2/Keap1 complex [45, 99‚Äì101]. These phytochemicals
modulate Keap1-associated transcriptional regulation which
results in up-regulation of ARE-bearing genes encoding
phase II detoxifying enzymes and transporters that protect
normal cells from ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS)
or reactive metabolites of carcinogenic species [71]. Such
responses are thought to represent a form of cellular adapta-
tion to chemicals and oxidative stress that maintains cellular
redox homeostasis [15, 99]. Therefore, the use of dietary phy-
tochemicals to regulateNrf2-dependent antioxidant response
to counter oxidative DNA damage has emerged as a promis-
ing strategy for cancer prevention. Hormonal factors, especially 17√ü-estradiol (E2), play a
major role in the etiology of breast cancer where the cir-
culating levels of E2 itself are an independent risk factor. E2 can cause both oxidative DNA damage and attenuate
DNA repair leading to oncogenic mutagenesis [102]. In the
liver, the metabolism of E2 to its various phase I metabo-
lites, such as the carcinogenic 4-hydroxy estradiol (4E2),
primarily involves the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2
and CYP3A4 [103]. Dietary berries and their chemical con-
stituents are known for their cancer preventive potential,
which were recently shown to affect the enzymes involved in
carcinogen metabolism in mouse liver [104] and significantly
reduced hepatic oxidative DNA damage, indicated by the
level of 8-oxoG and other polar adducts validated by P32-
postlabeling experiments. Compared to crude berry juices,
ellagic acid, one of the bioactive components found in berries,
showed more elimination of oxidative DNA adducts induced
by redox cycling of 4E2 catalyzed by copper chloride in vitro
[105]. 3.3. Phytocompounds as Prooxidative Agents for Cancer Ther-
apy. Prooxidant phytoagents, on the other hand, are particu-
larly effective in treating aggressive tumors with abnormally
radical-reactive cellular environments. They act by tipping
the limit of oxidative stress that can be tolerated by tumor
cells over a limit, thus triggering apoptosis and cell death
[106]. Although pro-oxidant effects are observed after treat-
ment with certain phytoagents, generally, phytoagents do
not produce ROS directly. Instead, their prooxidant effect
is highly dependent on the original redox status of the
cell which determines sensitivity to cytotoxicity mediated
by phytoagents. The basal redox levels of cancer cells are
different from those of normal cells. Higher levels of free form
metal ions and higher levels of endogenous ROS production
in cancer cells sensitizes them to phytoagent-mediated proox-
idant cytotoxicity [30, 107, 108]. In this section, we elaborate
on how phytoagents act as prooxidants to selectively kill
cancer cells and their effects in cancer chemotherapy. 3.3.1. Major Prooxidant Mechanisms of Action of Phytoagents
(a) Promotion of Fenton(-Like) Reactions byCatalyzing Redox-
Cycling of Metal Ions. Phytoagents with strong reducing
capacity can reduce not only ROS but also metal ions. Under normal physiological conditions, most metal ions
are complexed with proteins and few exist in free form. However, in the presence of abundant free form metal ions,
phytoagents catalyze Fenton(-like) reactions that produce
injurious hydroxyl radicals [29, 109]. Notably, cancer cells
develop abnormally high concentrations of metal ions due
to overexpression of the transferrin receptor [110, 111]. When
excessive concentrations of free form metal ions exist, clas-
sical antioxidant phytoagents catalyze the redox cycling of
metal ions by reducing their oxidized form. As a result, a
burst of hydroxyl free radical production ensues and the
phytoagents become pro-oxidants. (b) Basal ROS Generation through Glutathione Depletion by
Electrophiles. Phytoagents with electrophilic groups can form
covalent bonds with cysteine resides of proteins. Glutathione,
the most abundant cysteine-containing peptide, thus can
be rapidly depleted due to adduct formation with elec-
trophilic phytoagents [112‚Äì115]. Upon glutathione depletion,
the buffering capacity of ROS is attenuated so that the
basal ROS production is revealed. Therefore, electrophilic
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 11
phytoagents exhibit pronounced pro-oxidant effect in cancer
cells with high ROS production and push cancer cells over
the tolerable limit of ROS. In contrast, the same dosage
of phytoagents produces a negligible pro-oxidant effect in
normal cells with low basal ROS production and boosts
antioxidant response by Nrf2 activation [71, 100, 116‚Äì121]. 3.3.2. Prooxidant Effects and Defense Systems of Selected
Phytoagents. ROS and cellular oxidative stress have long
been associated with cancer [122]. Hypoxic condition, that
is, low ambient oxygen pressure, is well described in cancer
cells, particularly in the central area of the tumor nodule
or mass [123]. These cancer cells act more like anaerobic
bacteria, showing low levels of mitochondrial oxidative phos-
phorylation, and generally survive through the generation of
ATP in an oxygen-independent manner [124].
