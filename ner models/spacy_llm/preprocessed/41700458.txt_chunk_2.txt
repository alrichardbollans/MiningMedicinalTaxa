Vitamin C cooperates with vitamin E to generate -tocopherol from - tocopherol radicals in membranes and lipoproteins.Through working along with other antioxidant enzymes, these antiox- idants have been suggested to reduce oxidative damage in humans [78], and thereby minimizing the risk of certain chronic diseases [79-81]. However, early epidemiological studies and clinical trials investigating the efficacy of these vitamins in affecting disease outcome concluded that there was insufficient evidence to link supplementation of humans with vitamin C, vitamin E, or -carotene with a reduction in in vivo oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, or DNA based on the measurement of oxidative biomarkers [82]. More recent clinical trials also suggest no correlatable effect between individual vitamins and chemoprevention [83, 84]. Further, anticancer properties reported for different vitamins have been discrepant. The history of the most well-known antioxidant, vitamin C, in cancer treatment is controversial while vitamins A and E only showed dispensable effects in tumor elimination [85]. However, the role of vitamin D in cancer treatment and prevention is promising [86, 87]. Interestingly, a large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in male physicians showed that, compared with placebo, men taking a daily multivitamin had a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of total cancer; however, there was no significant effect on some specific cancer types, such as prostate cancer and colorectal cancer. It was therefore concluded that "daily multivitamin supplementation modestly but significantly reduced the risk of total cancer [88]." Recently, in a large cohort studywith 356 healthy subjects, dietary intake of vitamins was demonstrated to be associated with reduced levels ofmarkers of DNAdamage and oxidation (M1dG and 8-oxoG) measured in peripheral white blood cells. Notably, the associations were stronger in nonsmokers than in smokers [89]. It is important to keep in mind that several environmental factors can affect the antioxidant capacity of these vitamins. Environmental factors such as smoking and metal intoxication that causes excessive ROS burden to the body should be avoided, because antioxidant phytoagents can prevent de novo oxidation to nucleic acid but are not able to rescue or reverse oxidized nucleic acid caused by persistent oxidative insults from environmental stimulation. In another study, the protective effects of vitamin C and a natural phenol resveratrol on ethanol-induced oxida- tive DNA damage in human peripheral lymphocytes were investigated. Resveratrol showed significant DNA protection in a 24 h experiment, while the protective effect of vitamin C was seen in only 1 h. Both compounds were shown to directly scavenge hydroxyl radicals produced during ethanol metabolism. In addition, resveratrol inhibited dehydrogenase gene expression and activated the base excision repair (BER) system, mechanisms whichmay underlie its substantial effect on DNA protection. Vitamin C, however, showed no effect on the ethanol metabolic pathway or the BER system [90]. The antioxidant properties of vitamins in comparison to whole fruits and vegetables as anticancer agents are also of interest. The effectiveness of kiwifruit in decreasing oxidative DNA damage was assessed using comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) tomeasure damage to lymphocytes collected from a human trial in which subjects drank kiwifruit juice. It was observed that a simple extract of kiwifruit was more effective than a solution of vitamin C in protecting DNA from damage in vitro [91]. This study demonstrated that the significant antioxidant activity of kiwifruit ex vivo and in vitro is not attributable entirely to vitamin C contained in the fruit. Instead, other components like phenolics and vitamin E may also contribute to the antioxidant effect of kiwi fruit extract [92]. These studies suggest an undetermined role of vitamin C present in fresh fruits, although different vitamin C content present in kiwifruit extractmight result in different protective effects. (b) Phenolics. Phenolic compounds are present in high con- centrations in many components of the so-called "Mediter- ranean diet," including fruit and vegetables. These com- pounds seem to scavenge ROS, resulting in protection against oxidative DNA. This assumption was verified by testing the effect of Mediterranean plant extracts (Crepis vesicaria L, Origanumheracleoticum, Scandix australis L,Amaranthus sp., Scolymus hispanicus L, and Thymus piperella L) on oxidative DNA damage induced in lymphocytes by H 2 O 2 in relation to their polyphenolic content using comet assay [93].This study revealed that the protection of DNA by phenols present in Mediterranean plants is only partly due to ROS scavenging properties. Phenols can also attenuate Fenton(-like) reac- tions through metal ion chelation and induce endogenous antioxidant defense through Nrf2 activation. Apparently, ROS scavenging only partially contributes to antioxidant 10 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity activity of Mediterranean diet-derived phenolics or other phytochemicals. Their protection against oxidative DNA may involve other redox regulation such as upregulation of antioxidant enzymes in cells and attenuation of Fenton(-like) reaction by metal ion chelation. In the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), oxidative stress is a major predisposing condition which is relevant to the development and progression of the cancer. In search for a dietary chemopreventive approach for the lethal HCC, pomegranate, an ancient fruit has gained atten- tion owing to its significant antioxidant properties mainly contributed by the anthocyanins and ellagic acid derivatives [94, 95]. Pomegranate emulsion, a proprietary combination of aqueous phase extract and pomegranate seed oil contain- ing several polyphenolic compounds, mixed with octadeca- trienoic acids, sterols, steroids, and -tocopherol, was found to prevent hepatocarcinogenesis through induction of Nrf2- regulated phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing genes such as several GST isozymes that are involved in antagonizing oxidative stress [96]. A similar Nrf2-mediated antioxidant effect was also observed in HCC rats treated with blackcur- rant anthocyanins [97]. Flavonoids are naturally occurring diphenylpropanoids that appear in animal and human cells following consump- tion of vegetables, fruits, and beverages such as tea and wine. Flavonoids can be classified into six major subgroups: flavonols (e.g., quercetin, kaempferol), flavones (e.g., api- genin, luteolin), flavanones (e.g., hesperidin, naringenin), flavan-3-ols (e.g., catechin, theaflavin, and gallic esters of catechin and theaflavins), anthocyanidins (e.g., pelargonidin, cyanidin), and isoflavones (e.g., genistein, daidzein). Epi- demiological studies suggest that dietary intake of flavonoids may reduce the risk of tumors of the breast, colon, lung, prostate, and pancreas. However, the generalizability of these anticancer effects remains a subject of study [98]. (c) Electrophilic Phytochemicals. Electrophilic phytochemi- cals, such as phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC), sulforaphane (SFN), turmeric, curcumin, and EGCG, prevent oxidative modification and mutation of genes through activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 complex [45, 99-101]. These phytochemicals modulate Keap1-associated transcriptional regulation which results in up-regulation of ARE-bearing genes encoding phase II detoxifying enzymes and transporters that protect normal cells from ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) or reactive metabolites of carcinogenic species [71]. Such responses are thought to represent a form of cellular adapta- tion to chemicals and oxidative stress that maintains cellular redox homeostasis [15, 99]. Therefore, the use of dietary phy- tochemicals to regulateNrf2-dependent antioxidant response to counter oxidative DNA damage has emerged as a promis- ing strategy for cancer prevention. Hormonal factors, especially 17ss-estradiol (E2), play a major role in the etiology of breast cancer where the cir- culating levels of E2 itself are an independent risk factor. E2 can cause both oxidative DNA damage and attenuate DNA repair leading to oncogenic mutagenesis [102]. In the liver, the metabolism of E2 to its various phase I metabo- lites, such as the carcinogenic 4-hydroxy estradiol (4E2), primarily involves the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 [103]. Dietary berries and their chemical con- stituents are known for their cancer preventive potential, which were recently shown to affect the enzymes involved in carcinogen metabolism in mouse liver [104] and significantly reduced hepatic oxidative DNA damage, indicated by the level of 8-oxoG and other polar adducts validated by P32- postlabeling experiments. Compared to crude berry juices, ellagic acid, one of the bioactive components found in berries, showed more elimination of oxidative DNA adducts induced by redox cycling of 4E2 catalyzed by copper chloride in vitro [105]. 3.3. Phytocompounds as Prooxidative Agents for Cancer Ther- apy. Prooxidant phytoagents, on the other hand, are particu- larly effective in treating aggressive tumors with abnormally radical-reactive cellular environments. They act by tipping the limit of oxidative stress that can be tolerated by tumor cells over a limit, thus triggering apoptosis and cell death [106]. Although pro-oxidant effects are observed after treat- ment with certain phytoagents, generally, phytoagents do not produce ROS directly. Instead, their prooxidant effect is highly dependent on the original redox status of the cell which determines sensitivity to cytotoxicity mediated by phytoagents. The basal redox levels of cancer cells are different from those of normal cells. Higher levels of free form metal ions and higher levels of endogenous ROS production in cancer cells sensitizes them to phytoagent-mediated proox- idant cytotoxicity [30, 107, 108]. In this section, we elaborate on how phytoagents act as prooxidants to selectively kill cancer cells and their effects in cancer chemotherapy. 3.3.1. Major Prooxidant Mechanisms of Action of Phytoagents (a) Promotion of Fenton(-Like) Reactions byCatalyzing Redox- Cycling of Metal Ions. Phytoagents with strong reducing capacity can reduce not only ROS but also metal ions. Under normal physiological conditions, most metal ions are complexed with proteins and few exist in free form. However, in the presence of abundant free form metal ions, phytoagents catalyze Fenton(-like) reactions that produce injurious hydroxyl radicals [29, 109]. Notably, cancer cells develop abnormally high concentrations of metal ions due to overexpression of the transferrin receptor [110, 111]. When excessive concentrations of free form metal ions exist, clas- sical antioxidant phytoagents catalyze the redox cycling of metal ions by reducing their oxidized form. As a result, a burst of hydroxyl free radical production ensues and the phytoagents become pro-oxidants. (b) Basal ROS Generation through Glutathione Depletion by Electrophiles. Phytoagents with electrophilic groups can form covalent bonds with cysteine resides of proteins. Glutathione, the most abundant cysteine-containing peptide, thus can be rapidly depleted due to adduct formation with elec- trophilic phytoagents [112-115]. Upon glutathione depletion, the buffering capacity of ROS is attenuated so that the basal ROS production is revealed. Therefore, electrophilic Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 11 phytoagents exhibit pronounced pro-oxidant effect in cancer cells with high ROS production and push cancer cells over the tolerable limit of ROS. In contrast, the same dosage of phytoagents produces a negligible pro-oxidant effect in normal cells with low basal ROS production and boosts antioxidant response by Nrf2 activation [71, 100, 116-121]. 3.3.2. Prooxidant Effects and Defense Systems of Selected Phytoagents. ROS and cellular oxidative stress have long been associated with cancer [122]. Hypoxic condition, that is, low ambient oxygen pressure, is well described in cancer cells, particularly in the central area of the tumor nodule or mass [123]. These cancer cells act more like anaerobic bacteria, showing low levels of mitochondrial oxidative phos- phorylation, and generally survive through the generation of ATP in an oxygen-independent manner [124]. Many conven- tional anticancer drugs including vinblastine, doxorubicin, campthotecin, cisplatin, and inostamycin have been reported to activate a caspase-3(-like) protease causing generation of H 2 O 2 presumably through the activation of NADPH oxidase that subsequently induces apoptosis in cancer cells [125]. Intriguingly, cancer cells are frequently deficient in crucial antioxidative enzymes, such as catalase, GPx, and SOD, and therefore demonstrate a high vulnerability to ROS. One antitumor strategy is to deliver excess oxidative stress into tumor cells or to target the disruption of the antioxidative defense systems of tumor cells.This strategy has been termed "oxidation therapy" in cancer treatment [126]. Several studies have reported that certain dietary anticancer/cancer preven- tive agents cause generation of ROS specifically in tumor cells, not in normal cells [56, 127, 128].Through adaptation, normal cells that are exposed to pro-oxidant chemopreventive agents which generate oxidative stress can acquire resistance to transformation via adjusting the normal redox tone of these cells. In contrast, transformed cells, which typically endure an oxidizing intracellular environment, would ultimately succumb due to an excess of ROS caused by the same agent. ROS and cellular redox tone are exploitable targets in cancer chemoprevention via the stimulation of cytoprotection in normal cells and/or the induction of apoptosis in malignant cells [129]. Dietary intake of such chemopreventive agents could be a prefect strategy to achieve this purpose. (a) Sulfur-Containing Compounds. Diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyltrisulfide (DATS) which are found in abun- dance in garlic are among the dietary factors studied extensively for their anticancer action involving induction of oxidative stress in the human body, as reviewed else- where [130]. The pro-oxidant and thiol-adducting activ- ities of these electrophilic organosulfur compounds are attributed to their reactive isothiocyanate (R-N=C=S) phar- macophore. Dietary isothiocyanates include sulforaphane, phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), benzyl-isothiocyanate, and 6-methylsulfinylhexyl-isothiocyanate (Figure 6). Origi- nally, copper-mediated oxidative DNA damage induced by these isothiocyanates was considered to be carcinogenic [131]; however, later studies demonstrated that these phytochem- icals exhibit preferential cytostaticity in premalignant and tumor cells via their pleiotropic pro-oxidant activities as reviewed elsewhere [106]. (b) Curcumin. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) from turmeric, like isothiocyanates, is a pleiotropic redox modulator that is involved in multiple cellular activities as a pro/antioxidant and metal chelator, as recently reviewed [59]. Curcumin, which contains an electrophilic Michael acceptor as an active moiety, can also mediate strand scission of DNA in the presence of Cu (II) [132].The compelling anticancer activities of curcumin have been widely demonstrated across different cancer cell lines and animal systems, as a function of above- mentioned reactive pharmacophores targeting various cellu- lar molecules. Currently, the cancer preventive/therapeutic potential of curcumin, as single or combinatorial agent, is under evaluation in various clinical trials, including multiple myeloma, rectal cancer, metastatic colon cancer, advanced osteosarcoma, and pancreatic cancer [59]. (c) Sesquiterpene Lactones. The sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) have also gained considerable attention for their effective- ness in treating inflammation, headaches, infections, and other human diseases. SLs contain Michael acceptors that act as electrophiles that can increase cellular ROS and modulate specific redox sensitive targets in cancer cells. Artemisinin and parthenolide (Figure 6) are SL-derived drugs now being evaluated in cancer clinical trials [133- 138]. Artemisinin, isolated from Artemisia annua (qinhao, sweet wormwood), possesses an endoperoxide bridge in the reactive pharmacophore that can be activated and cleaved by endogenous ions, leading to the generation of radical species and ROS through the Fenton reaction, which was observed to be a common mechanism underlying both the antimalarial and anticancer activities of the compound [139]. Parthenolide, identified from feverfew (Tanacetum parthe- nium), contains an electrophilic -methylene--lactone as the active moiety underlying its anticancer activity related to the Michael acceptor electrophile [66, 67]. Phytochemicals with prooxidant properties such as the SLs with Michael acceptor electrophiles have the potential to sensitize tumors in cancer treatment. For example, concurrent delivery of the SL parthenolide and the clinical drug paclitaxel in mixed micelles greatly improved the therapeutic response of resistant lung cancer cell lines to paclitaxel treatment [140]. In a mouse peritoneal dissemination model, parthenolide also improved the chemosensitivity of paclitaxel against gastric cancer through deregulation of theNF-B signalling pathway [141]. Nevertheless, parthenolide and dehydrocostus lactone can also suppress cancer cell activity through downregulating other molecular targets, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C, and induction of c-Jun- N-termial kinase (JNK) [142]. In our laboratory, we identified a germacranolide SL deoxyelephantopin (DET) from a medicinal plant Elephan- topus scaber (Asteraceas) which contains an -methylene-- lactone, an ,-unsaturated lactone and a methacrylate ester side chain [62].
