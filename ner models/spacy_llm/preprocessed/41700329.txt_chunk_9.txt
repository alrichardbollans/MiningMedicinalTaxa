Using theThcell differentiation assay as a screening
platform, 3 polyynes, 2-𝛽-D-glucopyranosyloxy-1 -
hydroxytrideca-5,7,9,11-tetrayne (53), 3-𝛽-D-glucopyranosyl-
1-hydroxy-6(E)- tetradecene-8,10,12-triyne (69), and 2-𝛽-D-
glucopyranosyloxy-1-hydroxy-5(E)- tridecene-7,9,11-triyne
(49) were discovered from B. pilosa [49, 53]. The data shows
that cytopiloyne and other two polyynes suppressed the
differentiation of type 1 helper T (Th1) cells and production
of Th1 cytokines and promoted that of type 2 helper T (Th2)
cells and production of Th2 cytokines, thus explaining the
immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of B.
pilosa and its polyynes. Chang and colleagues were the first to report the effect of
the butanol extract of B. pilosa on the autoimmune diabetes
and airway inflammation inmice [48]. Imbalance in the levels
ofTh1 andTh2 and of various cytokines leads to autoimmune
diseases. T1D and other autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid
arthritis, Crohn’s disease, among others) are exacerbated by
an increase Th1 levels (specifically, CD4+ Th1 cells) while
Th2 cells antagonize this effect [19]. Moreover, Th2 cells
mediate asthma in ovalbumin-induced hypersensitivity in
BALB/c mice [48]. In their work [48], Chang and colleagues
showed that 10mg/kg butanol extracts with 1.5% (w/w)
compound 69 and 1.1% (w/w) compound 49 (Table 11)
ameliorated the development of Th1-mediated diabetes in
NOD mice through inhibition of 𝛽 cell death and leukocyte
infiltration. At the same dosage, the butanol extracts also
exacerbated ovalbumin-induced pulmonary inflammation
in BALB/c mice with an increase in the infiltration of
eosinophils and mast cells into the airway of the mice [48]. Despite the different outcomes, both mouse models proved
44 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
the concept that control over the Th1/Th2 shift is associated
with autoimmune diseases and that the B. pilosa butanol
extract can shift the differentiation of Th0 cells to Th2 cells
[48, 49]. An extended study presented by Chiang and colleagues
showed that compound 53 modulates T-cell functions [50]. Using CD4+ T cells from BALB/c mice, they demonstrated
that cytopiloyne decreased levels of IFN-𝛾 producing cells
(Th1) by 12.2% (from 72% to 59.8%). Since Th1 and Th2 cell
differentiation is antagonistic, it was expected that compound
53 increased the percentage of mouse IL-4 producing cells
(Th2) by 7.2% (from 23.7% to 30.9%). Subsequent assess-
ment of effect of compound 53 on the modulation of the
transcription of IL-4 and IFN-𝛾 showed that cytopiloyne, as
expected, decreased the splenocyte levels of IFN-𝛾 mRNA
and increasing that of IL-4 in a dose-dependent manner. In
the range of 0.1 to 3 𝜇g/mL of compound 53, the effects were
not attributed to its cytotoxicity. Consequently, using 3𝜇g/mL
cytopiloyne for 72 and 96 hours, the protein concentration of
IFN-𝛾 decreased to 18.6% and 44.4%, respectively. Under the
same conditions, cytopiloyne increased IL-4 concentrations
to 198.5% and 247.0% (for 72 and 96 hours, resp.). This
modulation of T-cell differentiation exhibited by compound
53 was used to explain its anti-diabetic activity [50]. The anti-diabetic role of cytopiloyne was extensively
discussed above (Section 3.3, anti-diabetic activity). The
molecular basis of the regulation of cytokine expression by
cytopiloyne has been described. Cytopiloyne directly elevated
the expression level of IL-4 via GATA-3 upregulation in
T cells [53]. However, reduction of IFN-𝛾 expression in T
cells seemed to come from the indirect opposing effect IL-4
cytokine because the expression level of T-bet was unaltered
[53]. In this way, cytopiloyne skewedTh1 polarization into the
Th2 state, conferring protection against T1D in NOD mice. Aside frompolarization ofThcell differentiation, cytopiloyne
also activated the expression of Fas ligand in pancreatic
b cells, this increase leading to the partial depletion of T
cells and reduction of immune response in local areas such
as the pancreas. Of note, cytopiloyne also inhibited T-cell
proliferation and activation. By targeting T cells from three
immunomodulatory actions, cytopiloyne protects against
T1D and probably other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases
[19]. The phytochemical constituents of B. pilosa exert their
functions on different immune cells to modulate immune
response. It is possible that some of the compounds may
have agonistic or antagonistic effects on immune response. Immune function of B. pilosa may depend on its compo-
sition and amount of compounds, which could explain the
apparently conflicting report of B. pilosa butanol extract
aggravating allergy in mice [48] while cellulosine-treated
extract ameliorated allergy [48, 75]. IFN-𝛾 promoter reporter
assays and T-cell differentiation assays were used to isolate
2 flavonoids [69] and 3 polyynes [49, 50] as immunomod-
ulatory compounds from the butanol fraction of B. pilosa. Interestingly, the flavonoids promote IFN-𝛾 expression in
NK and T cells. In marked contrast, the polyynes promote
IL-4 expression and indirectly inhibit IFN-𝛾 expression in
differentiating T cells. Sensitivity appears to be the key to
identifying structure- and bioactivity-related phytochemicals
from medicinal plants. 3.6. Antimalarial Activity. The use of chemical drugs against
pathogens has resulted in drug-resistant mutants. Examples
of drug resistance can be found in the species of the
Plasmodium that cause malaria. It is important to search for
new compounds to combat Plasmodium parasites [47]. A
study of the anti-malarial activity of the leaf extracts of B.
pilosa using a combination of phytochemistry and bioassays
showed that compound 49 (Table 11) showed activity against
a malaria parasite (P. falciparum NF54 strain) with an IC
50
value of 6.0 𝜇g/mL [77]. In addition, compound 49, isolated
from the aerial parts of B. pilosa, inhibited growth of the P.
falciparum FCR-3 strain with an IC
50
value of 0.35 𝜇g/mL. This compound was tested for its in vivo effect in mice
infected with P. berghei NK-65 strain. Results showed that
compound 49 decreased the average parasitemia in the red
blood cells by 20.7 (from 32.8% of that of the control to
12.1%) after an intravenous injection of 0.8mg/kg BW/day for
four days [47]. Further studies addressing the anti-malarial
mechanism underlying both polyynes and clinical studies are
needed. 3.7. Antibacterial Activity. Emergence of multiple antibiotic-
resistantmicrobes is becoming a global threat to public health
and a challenge to disease treatment. For instance, penicillin
is commonly used to combat a food-borne intracellular
bacteriumListeria; however, penicillin-resistant bacteria have
been discovered recently [69]. Chang and coworkers iso-
lated centaurein (110) and centaureidin (109) from B. pilosa
extract [69, 70]. Centaurein enhances expression of IFN-𝛾,
a key cytokine for macrophage activation and, consequently,
enhances bactericidal activity in macrophages [69, 70]. In
agreement with observed in vitro effects, centaurein was
reported to prevent and treat Listeria infection in C57BL/6J
mice [91]. Mechanistic studies confirmed that centaurein
exerted antilisterial action via IFN-𝛾 expression in wild-type
mice but not IFN-𝛾 knockout mice [91]. Further in vitro
studies on centaurein showed that this compound increased
IFN-𝛾 expression by 13% (from 17% to 20%), 20% (from 21%
to 41%), and 11% (from 6% to 17%) in CD4+ T cells, CD8+T
cells, and NK cells, respectively. That is to say, there was
an increase in IFN-𝛾 producing immune cells. As expected,
centaurein also enhanced the expression level of T-bet, a key
nuclear factor for IFN-𝛾 expression. Consistently, centaurein
augmented the serum IFN-𝛾 levels inC57BL/6Jmice, and this
augmentation peaked 24 hours after compound injection. The quantity of mouse serum IFN-𝛾 was sufficient to activate
macrophages in vitro and eradicated GFP-producing Listeria
inside macrophages. However, the entry of Listeria into
macrophages was not affected by centaurein-treated mouse
sera. Centaurein treatment at 20𝜇g per mouse rescued 30%
of the mice infected with a lethal dose of Listeria (2 ×
106 CFU). It is noteworthy that in the presence of ampicillin
(5 𝜇g/mouse), centaurein (20 𝜇g/mouse) rescued 70% of the
mice, suggesting an additive effect between ampicillin and
centaurein [91]. Despite lower abundance, centaureidin was
Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 45
30 times more active than centaurein in terms of IFN-𝛾
production [91]. Aside from the indirect antibacterial action mentioned
above, extract and/or compounds of B. pilosa also showed
direct bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal action. One study
reported that essential oils and leaf/flower extracts of B.
pilosa could suppress the growth of gram positive and gram
negative bacteria as evidenced by zone of inhibition assays. In this study, antibacterial activity of the essential oils from
the leaves and flowers of B. pilosa was determined in an
attempt to identify natural products as food preservatives for
prevention of microbial multiplication and food oxidation. The essential oils and extracts of B. pilosa leaves and flow-
ers showed moderate but different extents of antibacterial
activity (Table 17). In general, essential oils had higher
antibacterial activity than crude extracts. One explanation for
this could be that monoterpenes in the essential oils destroy
cellular integrity and, subsequently, inhibit the respiration
and ion transport processes. The presence of antibacterial
𝛽-caryophyllene could be another explanation as reported
elsewhere [92]. Another study reported that the methanol
and acetone extract of B. pilosa roots displayed antibacterial
activities against the bacteria listed in Table 18 [93] and
methanol extracts from the roots seemed to be the most
effective. Another study indicated that the polyyne, (R)-1,2-
dihydroxytrideca-3,5,7,9,11-pentayne (49), from this plant
also suppressed bacterial growth as shown by the minimum
inhibitory concentration required to inhibit 50% bacterial
growth (MIC
50
) in Table 19. This compound was highly
effective against several Gram positive and Gram negative
bacteria including the drug-resistant bacteria Staphylococcus
aureus N315 (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis NCTC12201
(VRE) [47]. Strikingly, compound 49 had a similar MIC
50
value to antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, and
amphotericin B) in most of the bacteria tested. Antibacterial activity of B. pilosa extracts and compo-
nents, expressed as MIC
50
and the mean zone of inhibition,
is tabulated in Tables 17, 18, and 19.The zone of inhibition for
Ampicilline (positive control) ranges from 15.3 ± 0.3mm to
44.3 ± 0.2mm [92]. 3.8. Antifungal Activity. B. pilosa has traditionally been used
to treat microbial infection. Recently, different parts of B.
pilosa have been tested for antifungal activities. Deba and
colleagues first evaluated the antifungal effect of the hot
water extracts of the B. pilosa roots, stems, and leaves against
Corticium rolfsii, Fusarium solani, and Fusarium oxysporum. They discovered that C. rolfsii was most suppressed by
treatment with B. pilosa as its growth was reduced at almost
all the tested doses, followed by F. oxysporum and F. solani
[99]. However, the fungicidal activities of the stems, and
roots were greater than the leaves [99]. Moreover, the same
group assessed the antifungal activity of the essential oils
and aqueous extracts from B. pilosa flowers and leaves [92]. They showed that the extracts and oils had antifungal activity
against C. rolfsii, F. solani, and F. oxysporum. Essential oils
appeared to have better fungicidal activity thanwater extracts
as summarized in Table 20. Another study by Ashafa and colleagues showed that
acetone, methanol, and water extracts of the B. pilosa roots
showed antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger, A.
flavus, and Penicillium notatum using the agar dilution
method. The results are tabulated in Table 21 [93]. Negative
controls showed 0% growth inhibition.The methanol extract
of the B. pilosa roots at 10mg/mL was also effective against
Candida albicans [93].Of note, B. pilosa obtained fromPapua
New Guinea had no activity against A. niger and C. albicans
[126], but the SouthAfrican (EasternCape) ecotype exhibited
moderate activity against C. albicans [93]. This discrepancy
may depend on extraction solvents, extraction procedure,
assay techniques, different plant parts, and abundance of
active compounds. B. pilosa produces a variety of secondary metabolites
such as flavonoids, phenylacetylenes, alkaloids, sterols, ter-
penoids, and tannis [92, 93]. However, none of them have
been confirmed as active compounds against fungi. Further
investigation of active compounds from B. pilosa is necessary
to further understand the antifungal efficacy of this plant. 3.9. Hypotensive and Vasodilatory Activities. In early studies,
Dimo and colleagues used three rat models, normotensive
Wistar rats (NTR), salt-loading hypertensive rats (SLHR),
and spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) to investigate the
hypotensive effect of the methanol crude extract of B. pilosa
leaves [28, 127]. The extract lowered systolic blood pressure
in hypertensive rats (SLHR and SHR) to a greater degree
than NTR [28, 127]. In addition, a decrease in urinary
sodium ions and an increase in urinary potassium ions were
observed after treatment with the methanol extract of B.
pilosa leaves although neither differences were statistically
significant [28, 127]. Taking the data together, the study
proposed that B. pilosa leaf extract reduced blood pressure
via vasodilation [28, 127]. The same group continued to
test the antihypertensive effect of aqueous and methylene
chloride extracts of B. pilosa leaves in a hypertensive rat
model [28, 127]. To establish a fructose-induced hypertension
model, male Wistar rats were given 10% fructose solution
to drink ad libitum for three weeks. In addition to free
access to 10% fructose, the rats were treated with the aqueous
(150mg/kg) or methyl chloride (350mg/kg) extracts of B.
pilosa for additional three weeks [28, 127]. Both extracts of
B. pilosa leaves had a hypotensive effect on rats. However,
neither extracts reversed the elevation of serum insulin in
fructose-fed rats. Therefore, B. pilosa lowered blood pressure
irrespective of insulin [28, 127]. To better understand the
hypotensive mechanism, the authors investigated the effect
of a neutral extract of B. pilosa (NBP), a mixture of methanol
andmethylene chloride (1 : 1) extract after neutralization with
NaOH and HCl, on the heart and the blood pressure of
NTR and SHR [110]. This study showed that an intravenous
injection of the NBP resulted in a biphasic reduction in
systolic blood pressure.
