These data are consistent with our data indicating that oral delivery of the water extract of the B. pilosa whole plant at 1 g/kg BW/day, once a day, is safe in rats over 28 days (unpublished data). Taken together, these studies suggest that ingestion of B. pilosa aqueous extract at up to at 1 g/kg BW/day, once a day, is highly safe in rats. In addition, the acute toxicity of aqueous and ethanol extracts of B. pilosa in mice have been reported [134]. Five- to six-week-old mice with weights between 28 and 35 g received a peritoneal injection of both extracts at the different doses. The LD 50 , the dose that causes 50% lethality, of the aqueous and ethanol extracts in mice was 12.30 g/kg BW and 6.15 g/kg BW, respectively [134]. A complete toxicological study has not been completed for humans. Furthermore, the drug interactions of B. pilosa with other drugs are unknown. Further safety verification and clinical trials should be performed before B. pilosa can be considered for medicinal use. 5. Conclusions B. pilosa is an erect, perennial plant with green leaves, white or yellow flowers and tiny black seeds. As it is distributed worldwide and is widely used as a folk remedy, B. pilosa can be thought of as an extraordinary source of food and medicine. However, a comprehensive up-to-date review of research on B. pilosa has hitherto been unavailable. In this article, scientific studies on B. pilosa have been summarized and critically discussed from the perspectives of botany, ethnomedicine, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicol- ogy. B. pilosa is claimed to treat more than 40 disorders, and 201 compounds have been identified from this plant. The medicinal utility of B. pilosa and its modes of action in relation to its known phytochemicals were discussed herein. Polyynes, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, fatty acids, and phenolics are the primary bioactive compounds of B. pilosa, and they have been reported to be effective in the treatment of tumors, inflammation/immune modulation, diabetes, viruses, microbes, protozoans, gastrointestinal dis- eases, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Caution should be exercised in the therapeutic use of B. pilosa for hypoglycemia, hypotension, bleeding, and allergy.
