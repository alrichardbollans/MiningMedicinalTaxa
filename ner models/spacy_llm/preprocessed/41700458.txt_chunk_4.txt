It is important to discern when and how tomanipulate Nrf2 and so we canmake use of its advantages while minimizing potential disadvantages.The major negative sides of Nrf2 activation include promoting bioactivation of xenobiotics whose glucuronide conjugation form is genotoxic and forms adducts with DNA [186-188], neutralizing the chemotherapeutic effects in which oxidative stress plays a significant role in mediating cytotoxicity to cancer cells, and facilitating drug excretion from cell through increasing the expression levels ofmultidrug resistant pumps. Thereby, to minimize potential disadvantages, the use of phytoagents as Nrf2 activators for chemoprevention should carefully avoid coadministration of drugs that are bioacti- vated by Nrf2-regulated phase II enzyme processing. On the other hand, for pro-oxidant cancer chemotherapy, Nrf2 activation is deemed as a side-effect and should be suppressed by coadministration of Nrf2 inhibitor [185]. Still, more future studies are required to confirm these points and thus provide a more accurate prediction, and therefore application, of phytoagents in cancer management. For phytochemicals that function as both antioxidants and prooxidants, further characterization of the factors that determine the transition from antioxidative to prooxidative effects in the biosystem is essential. One contributing factor is the presence of transition metals. In addition, the doses of phytochemicals used in each treatment at different timesmay be crucial. In this regard, we propose some considerations on context-dependent, dual function of phytoagents thatmay help to understand and to predict the chemotherapeutic role of phytoagents. By comparing normal and cancer-bearing individuals, we know that the oxidative DNAmarker 8-oxoG correlates well with basal redox level [8, 189]. Cancer cells with higher basal redox level demonstrated elevated levels of 8-oxoG, whereas normal cells had lower levels of basal redox level and 8-oxoG. The overexpression of transferrin receptor in cancer cells increased intracellular level of ferrous ions and, presumably, increased the rate of the Fenton reaction. It can be assumed that high levels of ferrous ions in cancer cells switch the functions of phyto-antioxidants to those of pro-oxidants resulting in further elevation of ROS level in cancer cells but not in normal cells, and the selective killing of cancer cells. More studies are required to determine the con- centration threshold of metal ions that switche phytoagents to their prooxidant roles, so that potential chemotherapeutic applications can be better characterized. In summary, two main points form the base of the concept of the context- dependent dual role of phytoagents. One is the level of intracellular level of transition metal ions and the other is the basal redox level. The higher the two, the more likely the agent to produce a pro-oxidant effect, whereas the lower the two, the more likely the agent to produce an antioxidant effect. Continued rigorous research to identifymolecular targets and conduct human studies with bioactive phytochemicals are important to provide potential alternatives or novel approaches for plant-based cancer prevention or therapy. It is likely that the anticancer properties of phytochemicals result frommodulation of a number of molecular mechanisms that regulate different stages of carcinogenesis. In this regard, increased antioxidant strength may be important prior to dysregulation of signaling pathways during tumorigenesis, whereas prooxidant cytotoxicity may be critical in eliminat- ing transformed tumor cells that exhibit dysregulated redox balance and metal ion absorption. In conclusion, careful dose-response and stage-dependent studies that compare enhancement of antioxidant capacity and induction of oxida- tive stress by phytochemicals are essential to clarify when 16 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity and to what extent these phytoagents can be used in cancer prevention or therapy.
