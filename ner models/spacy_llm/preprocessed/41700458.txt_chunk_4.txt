Figure 8: Summary of mechanisms of action of phytoagents in chemoprevention and chemotherapeutics through modulating oxidative
stress. In the presence of ferrous ions (or other transition metal ions), phytoagents recycle the metal ion and thus promote the Fenton
reaction that generates the highly reactive hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide. Such prooxidant effects of phytoagents in the presence
of metal ion can overwrite their cytoprotective roles because the production of ROS may be faster than the induction of antioxidant defense. Hydrogen peroxide imposes oxidative damage on biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and DNA, and leads to protein carbonylation, lipid
peroxidation, and DNA base oxidation, which can be prevented by phytoantioxidants. Phytoantioxidants can activate Nrf2/ARE signaling
and thus transcriptionally upregulate a panel of antioxidant genes that can provide further antioxidant capacity. Glutathione synthetase (GSS)
can raise the level of glutathione (GSH) which can reduce oxidative damage by scavenging hydroxyl radicals, which otherwise cause oxidative
DNA damage and increase the chance of point mutation and genome instability during the DNA repair process while glutathione reductase
(GR) recycles the oxidized form of GSH and maintains the level of the reduced form of GSH. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxin
(TRX), and peroxiredoxin (PRX) can prevent oxidative insults on proteins and lipids. imply the anticancer property of polyphenols based on
the abundant copper detected in different types of tumors
[145, 153]. The enhanced electron transfer between transi-
tion metals and phytochemicals probably occurs in cancer
cells with higher levels of copper ions, which may induce
ROS generation subsequently leading to DNA damage [178,
180]. However, the mixture of a polyphenol and a transition
metal was shown to promote tumor growth in mice with
carcinogen induction that mimics the process of cancer
initiation [170, 171]. These studies raise concerns about the
potential carcinogenic activities of phytoagents. It is not
clear whether the mixture of antioxidant phytochemical and
transition metal resembles the oxidative stress that could
possibly initiate tumorigenesis in normal cells, but that such
a prooxidant effect drives the redox-sensitive cancer cells
to their antioxidant limit and leads to cytotoxicity that has
been applied in catalytic therapy.More studies are required to
clarify the interaction of phytoagents and redox active metals
as their oxidative potential may initiate tumors in a healthy
individual. 4. Future Prospects
This review provides updated and integrative information
about the regulation of nucleic acid oxidation by phytoagents
in cancer. Animalmodels and human epidemiological studies
have revealed that phytochemicals prevent carcinogenesis
through direct ROS scavenging or induction of cellular
antioxidant defense systems that consist of detoxifying
enzymes, defense machinery mediated by Nrf2-antioxidative
stress, and inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways that
together protect cells fromDNAdamage by ROS and reactive
metabolites of carcinogens [42, 57, 58] (Figure 8). Inves-
tigation of oxidative modulation of proteins and lipids as
well as DNA by phytochemicals provides a comprehensive
picture of their functions as redox regulators in cancer. In
general, antioxidant phytoagents are potentially useful in
cancer prevention because they can protect healthy cells from
oxidative DNA damage through radical scavenging, antiox-
idant defense system stimulation, and metal ion chelation;
prooxidant phytoagents, on the other hand, are particu-
larly effective in treating aggressive tumors with abnormally
Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 15
radical-reactive cellular environments by exceeding the limit
of oxidative stress that can be tolerated by tumor cells. Cancer
cells, in general, have a higher basal redox level due to either
defects in antioxidant defense or increased production of
ROS during oncogenic transformation [122, 126]. Therefore,
when challenged with similar quantities of ROS, cancer cells
fail to buffer/clear excessive ROS and cell death ensues. In
contrast, normal cells with lower redox levels are capable
of buffering/clearing ROS by inducible antioxidant defense
regulated by Nrf2/ARE signaling and are thus protected from
cell death. Recently, dietary levels of phytochemicals have
been suggested to trigger induction of low levels of oxidative
stress that may ‚Äúprime‚Äù cellular antioxidant defense systems
to resist higher level of oxidative insults, thus offering greater
protection against carcinogenic insult [60]. However, several studies have also hinted at a ‚Äúdark‚Äù
side of these cell-protective mechanisms. For example, the
cytotoxicity of the anticancer drug platinum was attenuated
by base excision repair of ROS-induced formation of 8-oxoG,
indicating that repairing genotoxic damage could contribute
to multidrug resistance of cancer cells [181]. Restoration of
glutathione level by overexpression of ùõæ-glutamylcysteine
synthetase was found to prevent DNA damage and subse-
quent apoptosis caused by genotoxic agents in a resistant
human ovarian carcinoma cell line [182]. Overexpression of
catalase was found to cause drug resistance in breast cancer
cell lines in chemotherapy [183]. These findings imply that
alteration of the expression of antioxidant enzymes could be
a mechanism through which cancer-cell resistance to redox-
based chemotherapeutic agents is promoted. On the other
hand, several phytochemicals have been indicated to upreg-
ulate the Nrf2 pathway which stimulates the defense system
and leads to cancer prevention. However, overexpression of
Nrf2 and its downstream genes was also observed in several
cancer cell lines and human tumors, rendering cancer cells
at an advantage for survival and unlimited proliferation. In
addition, increased Nrf2 activity was found in some resistant
cancer cells; in other words, to overcome chemoresistance in
tumors, the Nrf2 pathway has to be deregulated [184]. There-
fore, sophisticated design is necessary and caution has to be
taken when administrating and handling Nrf2-dependent (as
discussed above) phytochemicals in cancer patients, given
that transformed cancer cells that are ‚Äúoverprotected‚Äù by
antioxidants could possibly develop drug resistance. Nrf2 is one of the key players in phytoagent-mediated
antioxidant defensewhose activation confers a chemopreven-
tive effect. However, recent studies indicate that Nrf2 itself
also plays a double-bladed-sword role in cancer manage-
ment [185]. On one hand, Nrf2 orchestrates gene expression
that protects cells from oxidative damage and detoxifies
xenobiotics; on the other hand, the same effects confer
chemoresistance to cancer cells. It is important to discern
when and how tomanipulate Nrf2 and so we canmake use of
its advantages while minimizing potential disadvantages.The
major negative sides of Nrf2 activation include promoting
bioactivation of xenobiotics whose glucuronide conjugation
form is genotoxic and forms adducts with DNA [186‚Äì188],
neutralizing the chemotherapeutic effects in which oxidative
stress plays a significant role in mediating cytotoxicity to
cancer cells, and facilitating drug excretion from cell through
increasing the expression levels ofmultidrug resistant pumps. Thereby, to minimize potential disadvantages, the use of
phytoagents as Nrf2 activators for chemoprevention should
carefully avoid coadministration of drugs that are bioacti-
vated by Nrf2-regulated phase II enzyme processing. On
the other hand, for pro-oxidant cancer chemotherapy, Nrf2
activation is deemed as a side-effect and should be suppressed
by coadministration of Nrf2 inhibitor [185]. Still, more future
studies are required to confirm these points and thus provide
a more accurate prediction, and therefore application, of
phytoagents in cancer management. For phytochemicals that function as both antioxidants
and prooxidants, further characterization of the factors that
determine the transition from antioxidative to prooxidative
effects in the biosystem is essential. One contributing factor
is the presence of transition metals. In addition, the doses of
phytochemicals used in each treatment at different timesmay
be crucial. In this regard, we propose some considerations
on context-dependent, dual function of phytoagents thatmay
help to understand and to predict the chemotherapeutic role
of phytoagents. By comparing normal and cancer-bearing
individuals, we know that the oxidative DNAmarker 8-oxoG
correlates well with basal redox level [8, 189]. Cancer cells
with higher basal redox level demonstrated elevated levels of
8-oxoG, whereas normal cells had lower levels of basal redox
level and 8-oxoG. The overexpression of transferrin receptor
in cancer cells increased intracellular level of ferrous ions
and, presumably, increased the rate of the Fenton reaction. It can be assumed that high levels of ferrous ions in cancer
cells switch the functions of phyto-antioxidants to those of
pro-oxidants resulting in further elevation of ROS level in
cancer cells but not in normal cells, and the selective killing of
cancer cells. More studies are required to determine the con-
centration threshold of metal ions that switche phytoagents
to their prooxidant roles, so that potential chemotherapeutic
applications can be better characterized. In summary, two
main points form the base of the concept of the context-
dependent dual role of phytoagents. One is the level of
intracellular level of transition metal ions and the other is
the basal redox level. The higher the two, the more likely
the agent to produce a pro-oxidant effect, whereas the lower
the two, the more likely the agent to produce an antioxidant
effect. Continued rigorous research to identifymolecular targets
and conduct human studies with bioactive phytochemicals
are important to provide potential alternatives or novel
approaches for plant-based cancer prevention or therapy. It is
likely that the anticancer properties of phytochemicals result
frommodulation of a number of molecular mechanisms that
regulate different stages of carcinogenesis. In this regard,
increased antioxidant strength may be important prior to
dysregulation of signaling pathways during tumorigenesis,
whereas prooxidant cytotoxicity may be critical in eliminat-
ing transformed tumor cells that exhibit dysregulated redox
balance and metal ion absorption. In conclusion, careful
dose-response and stage-dependent studies that compare
enhancement of antioxidant capacity and induction of oxida-
tive stress by phytochemicals are essential to clarify when
