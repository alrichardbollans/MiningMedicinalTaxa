[88]. This work supports the use of B. pilosa as an anti-
inflammatory agent; however, no compounds responsible for
the anti-inflammatory activity of B. pilosa were identified. A further study also reported the anti-inflammatory
activity as well as the antiallergic activity of B. pilosa [75]. In
this study, dried powder of the aerial part of B. pilosa, which
had been pretreated with the enzyme cellulosine, was used
for further tests. The results showed that oral administration
of the cellulosine-treated B. pilosa lowered the level of serum
IgE in mice 10 days after immunization with DNP (2,4-
dintrophenyl)-Ascaris as an antigen. This treatment also
reduced dye exudation in skin induced by passive cutaneous
anaphylaxis and production of inflammatory mediators, his-
tamine, and substance P in rats [75]. Phytochemical analysis
showed that cellulosine treatment increased the percentage of
caffeic acid and flavonoids. This study suggests that B. pilosa
and its phenolics have anti-inflammatory functions. Phenolics and polyynes are major anti-inflammatory
phytochemicals present in B. pilosa (Table 11). Unsurpris-6
ingly, phenolics such as luteolin (103) and ethyl caffeate
(161) that are major constituents of B. pilosa have also
been reported to possess anti-inflammatory activity. Lute-
olin was reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in
macrophages. Xagorari and colleagues showed that luteolin
inhibited the release of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-𝛼 and
interleukin-6, in RAW 264.7 cells following LPS stimulation
[87]. It inhibited TNF-𝛼 production with an IC
50
value
of 1𝜇M. The underlying anti-inflammatory mechanism of
luteolin was reported to be the inactivation of Akt and
NF-𝜅B activation [87]. In addition, luteolin was reported
to confer anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of
LPS-stimulated iNOS expression in BV-2 microglial cells. It inhibited LPS-activated microglia in a dose-dependent
manner with an IC
50
value of 6.9 𝜇M.Moreover, immunoblot
and RT-PCR data proved that luteolin suppressed I𝜅B-𝛼
degradation and iNOS expression in LPS-activated microglia
[85]. Kim and colleagues stated that luteolin may have
beneficial effects on inflammatory neural diseases through
inhibition of iNOS expression [85]. A related study revealed
that luteolin decreased the transcriptional activity of NF-𝜅B
RelA via partial inhibition of TNF-mediated NF-𝜅B DNA
binding activity. Luteolin also inhibited Akt phosphorylation
and induced degradation of a transcription factor, interferon
regulatory factor (IRF) [86]. Chiang and colleagues showed that ethyl caffeate
(161) significantly inhibited NO production in mouse
macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells [84]. Based on MTT assays,
they concluded that this inhibition was not due to the
cytotoxicity of ethyl caffeate. The IC
50
value of ethyl caffeate
in the inhibition of NO production was 5.5 𝜇g/mL, slightly
lower than curcumin (positive control) which has an
IC
50
value of 6.5𝜇g/mL. They demonstrated that ethyl
caffeate exerted anti-inflammatory activity via the reduced
transcription and translation of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide
synthase) in RAW 246.7 cells. In addition, this compound
also suppressed COX-2 expression in RAW 246.7 cells
and MCF-7 cells. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect
of ethyl caffeate was verified by testing in TPA-treated
mouse skin. Like celecoxib, the positive control, ethyl
caffeate significantly abolished COX-2 expression in a
dose-dependent manner. Ethyl caffeate at 1mg/200𝜇L/site
(24mM) inhibited COX-2 expression at a level comparable
to celecoxib at 1mg/200𝜇L/site (13mM). Remarkably, ethyl
caffeate at 48mM (2mg/200𝜇L/site) was more effective
than celecoxib at 131mM (10mg/200𝜇L/site). Moreover,
this compound inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-𝜅B
(NF-𝜅B) by LPS via the prevention of NF-𝜅B binding to
DNA [84]. In addition, 3 ethyl caffeate analogs (ethyl 3,4-
dihydroxyhydrocinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, and catechol)
also showed different degrees of NF-𝜅B binding to DNA as
listed in Table 12. Ethyl cinnamate lacks a catechol moiety
which results in ineffective inhibition of NF-𝜅B binding to
DNA [84]. Pereira and colleagues assessed the anti- 7
inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities of
B. pilosa methanol extract as well as one polyyne,
2-O-𝛽-glucosyltrideca-11(E)-en-3, 5,7,9-tetrayn-1,2-diol
(54) in T lymphocytes and a zymosan-induced arthritis
mouse model [27]. They first examined the in vitro effect of 8
the B. pilosa extract and compound 54 on cell proliferation of
human T cells stimulated with 5𝜇g/mL phytohemagglutinin
(PHA) or 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate
(TPA) plus 15 𝜇M ionomycin and on cell proliferation of
mouse T cells stimulated with 5 𝜇g/mL concanavalin A
(Con A). The data demonstrated that both methanol extract
and compound 54 suppressed T-cell proliferation in a
dose-dependent manner. The estimated IC
50
values of the B.
pilosa extract against human T cells stimulated with 5𝜇g/mL
PHA and 100 nM TPA plus 15𝜇M ionomycin were 12.5 and
25 𝜇g/mL, respectively. In comparison with the methanol
extract, compound 54 showed 10-fold more inhibition of
human T-cell proliferation with an estimated IC
50
value of
1.5 𝜇g/mL. Accordingly, the B. pilosa extract and compound
54 dose-dependently suppressed mouse T-cell proliferation

with estimated IC
50
values of 30 and 2.5 𝜇g/mL, respectively. Taken together, the data indicate that the B. pilosa extract
and compound 54 act on human and mouse T cells. To
test the in vivo effect of the B. pilosa extract and compound
54, a zymosan-induced arthritis mouse model was used. This model was established from B10.A/SgSnJ mice with an
injection of zymosan (0.15mg). The zymosan-injected mice9
received an intraperitoneal injection of the B. pilosa extract
(1, 5, or 10mg) at one dose a day for 5 days. Popliteal lymph
node (PLN) weight was monitored to check the development
of arthritis. The results revealed that 10mg of the methanol
extract of B. pilosa extract could significantly diminish
inflammation as evidenced by PLN weight [27]. This work
suggests that B. pilosa (and compound 54) can suppress
immune response and inflammation. 3.3. Antidiabetic Activity. Anti-diabetic agents are primarily
developed from plants and other natural resources [8, 24, 49,
51, 53]. B. pilosa is one of 1,200 plant species that have been
investigated for antidiabetic activity [120, 121].B. pilosa is used
as an anti-diabetic herb in America, Africa, and Asia [51, 120,
122]. Many studies have indicated that B. pilosa could treat
type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in animals. Etiologically speaking, T1D is caused by autoimmune-
mediated destruction of pancreatic 𝛽 cells, leading to insulin
deficiency, hyperglycemia, and complications. Currently,
there is no cure for T1D. Polarization ofTh cell differentiation
controls the development of T1D. Suppression of Th1 cell
differentiation and promotion of Th2 cell differentiation
ameliorate T1D [123]. One study showed that the butanol
fraction of B. pilosa inhibited T-cell proliferation, decreased
Th1 cells and cytokines, and increased Th2 cells and
cytokines, leading to prevention of T1D in nonobese
diabetic (NOD) mice [49]. Based on a bioactivity-directed
isolation strategy, 3 polyynes, 2-𝛽-D-Glucopyranosyloxy
-1-hydroxytrideca-5,7,9,11-tetrayne (53), also known as
cytopiloyne, 3-𝛽-D-Glucopyranosyl-1-hydroxy-6(E)-
tetradecene-8,10,12-triyne (69), 2-𝛽-D- Glucopyranosyloxy-
1-hydroxy-5(E)-tridecene-7,9,11-triyne (50) were identified
from B. pilosa [49, 53]. The IC
50
value of the butanol fraction
was 200𝜇g/mL. This inhibition was reported to be partially
attributed to cytotoxicity because the butanol fraction at
