Among the three polyynes found in B. pilosa, cytopiloyne (53) had the most potent anti-T1D activity [53]. To test the in vivo effect of cytopiloyne, NODmice received intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection of cytopiloyne at 25g/kg BW, 3 times per week. Twelve-week-old NOD mice started to develop T1D, and 70% of NOD mice aged 23 weeks and over developed T1D. Remarkably, 12- to 30-week-old NOD mice treated with cytopiloyne showed normal levels of blood glucose (<200mg/dL) and insulin (1-2 ng/mL).

In vitro study showed that cytopiloyne (53) inhibited the differentiation of na"iveTh (Th0) cells (i.e., CD4+ T cells) into Th1 cells and promoted differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells [50]. The in vitro data are consistent with the in vivo results indicating that cytopiloyne reducedTh1differentiation and increased Th2 differentiation as shown by intracellular cytokine staining and FACS analysis [53]. In line with the skewing of Th differentiation, the level of serum IFN- and IgG2c decreased while that of serum IL-4 and serum IgE increased compared to the negative controls (PBS-treated mice). Cytopiloyne also enhanced the expression of GATA- 3, a master gene for Th2 cell differentiation, but not the expression of T-bet, a master gene forTh1 cell differentiation, further supporting its role in skewingTh differentiation [53]. Also importantly, cytopiloyne partially depleted CD4+ rather than CD8+ T cells in NOD mice [53]. As shown in Table 13, coculture assays showed that the depletion of CD4+ T cells was mediated through the induction of Fas ligand expression on pancreatic islet cells by cytopiloyne, leading to apoptosis of infiltrating CD4+ T cells in the pancreas via the Fas and Fas ligand pathways. However, cytopiloyne did not induce the expression of TNF- in pancreatic islet cells and, thus, had no effect on CD8+ T cells [53]. In addition, Chang and colleagues showed that cytopi- loyne dose-dependently inhibited T-cell proliferation stimu- lated by IL-2 plus Con A or anti-CD3 antibody, using [3H] thymidine incorporation assay [53]. Overall, the mechanism of action of cytopiloyne and, probably, its derivatives in T1D includes inhibition of T-cell proliferation, skewing of Th cell differentiation, and partial depletion of Th cells.

To evaluate this hypothesis, ovalbumin (Ova) was used as a T-cell dependent antigen to prime NOD mice, which had already received cytopiloyne or PBS vehicle. Ova priming boosted similar anti-Ova titers in cytopiloyne-treated mice and PBS-treated mice, but a difference in immunoglobulin isotype was observed in the two groups. Thus, it was concluded that cytopiloyne is an immunomodulatory compound rather than an immunosup- pressive compound [50, 53]. T2D is a chronic metabolic disease with serious com- plications resulting from defects in either insulin secretion, insulin action, or both [124]. A study by Ubillas et al. showed that the aqueous ethanol extract of the aerial part of B. pilosa at 1 g/kg body weight (BW) lowered blood glucose in db/db mice, a T2D mouse model [51]. Based on a bioactivity-guided identification, compounds 69 and 50 were identified. Further, the mixture of the compounds (69 : 50) in a 2 : 3 ratio significantly decreased blood glucose concentration and reduced food intake on the second day of treatment when administered at doses of 250mg/kg twice a day to C5BL/Ks-db/db mice. When tested at 500mg/kg, a more substantial drop in blood glucose level as well as the stronger anorexic effect (food intake reduced from 5.8 g/mouse/day to 2.5 g/mouse/day) was observed [51]. In this study, it was suggested that the blood glucose lower- ing effect of B. pilosa was caused, in part, by the hunger suppressing effect of its polyynes [51]. However, the hunger suppressing effect of the ethanol extract of B. pilosa was not found in the studies described below. In another study [24], water extracts of B. pilosa (BPWE) were used in diabetic db/db mice, aged 6-8 weeks, with postprandial blood glucose levels of 350 to 400mg/dL. Like oral anti- diabetic glimepiride, which stimulates insulin release, one single dose of BPWE reduced blood glucose levels from 374 to 144mg/dL. The antihyperglycemic effect of BPWE was inversely correlated to an increase in serum insulin levels, suggesting that BPWE acts to lower blood glucose via increased insulin production. However, BPWE had different insulin secretion kinetics to glimepiride [24]. One flaw in current anti-diabetics is their decreasing efficacy over time. The authors investigated the long term anti-diabetic effect of BPWE in db/db mice. BPWE reduced blood glucose, increased blood insulin, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced the percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Both long-term and one-time experiments strongly support the anti-diabetic action of BPWE [24]. In sharp contrast to glimepiride, BPWE protected against islet atrophy in mouse pancreas. The investigators further evaluated anti-diabetic properties of 3 B. pilosa varieties, B. pilosa L. var. radiate (BPR), B.pilosa L. var. pilosa (BPP), and B. pilosa L. var.minor (BPM) in db/db mice [8]. One single oral dose (10, 50 and 250mg/kg body weight) of BPR, BPP, or BPM crude extracts decreased postprandial blood glucose levels in db/db mice for up to four hours, and the reduction of glucose levels in the blood appeared to be dose-dependent. Comparing the three variants, BPR extract resulted in a higher reduction in blood glucose levels when administered at the same dose as 42 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 20: Antifungal activity of B. pilosa [92].
