Keap1 recruits ubiquitin ligase E3 which then ubiquitinates Nrf2 and directs it to the proteasome degradation pathway. The increased level of ROS promotes the dissociation of Nrf2 and Keap1, either via activation of kinases that phosphorylate Nrf2 or by oxidization of key cysteine residues that govern Keap1 activity. The dissociated Nrf2 is then translocated into the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE). ARE-regulated genes are then transcriptionally activated, including a panel of antioxidant enzymes or proteins, such as glutathione synthetase (GSS), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), thioredoxin (TRX), thioredoxin reductase (TRR), and peroxiredoxin (PRX). These inducible antioxidant enzymes then provide further ROS clearance capacity and antioxidant defense mechanism to exert a cytoprotective effect. 2.2. Cellular Antioxidant DefenseMechanisms: Control of ROS Levels and Repair of Oxidized DNA Bases. Proper control of ROS is critical for the maintenance of redox balance and genome integrity. Otherwise, excessive levels of ROS would overwrite the roles of ROS as signaling mediators and jeopardize the normal physiological processes inside the cell. Several layers of antioxidant defense have been proposed as preventive strategies against nucleic acid oxidation, including nonenzymatic removal of ROS by scavenger molecules, chelation of metals that catalyze ROS formation, inducible enzymatic removal of ROS, and the DNA repair system responsible for oxidative DNA lesion. Cellular molecules that can serve as radical scavengers form a first line of defense in the control of ROS levels (Figure 3(b)). These molecules include metabolites such as vitamin C, vitamin E, ubiquinol-10, and urate, as well as the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) and the thioredoxin (TRX) system [31]. Meanwhile, cellular metal-chelating proteins play key roles in controlling the level of free metal ions and thus enhance or prevent ROS generation by metal-catalyzed Fenton of Fenton-like reactions. These proteins include ferritin [32, 33], transferrin [34], coeruloplasmin [35], and metallothionein [36]. ROS scavengers and metal-binding proteins do not provide complete protection from ROS damage. Therefore, another layer of protection is provided in the form of enzymatic removal of ROS. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is responsible for the transformation of superoxide anions into hydrogen peroxide, which is subsequently transformed into oxygen and water by catalase (CAT) or into water by glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [14]. The removal of hydrogen peroxide by GPx consumes the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) and generates the oxidized form (GSSG). GSSG can later be recycled by glutathione reductase (GR) and so replen- ish the GSH pool. Notably, metabolic enzymes responsible for NADPH production are critical factors in maintaining cellular redox balance, because NADPH is an indispensable factor responsible for the recycling of GSH and TRX by GR and thioredoxin reductase (TRR). Defects in NADPH supplying enzymes, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge- nase (G6PD) deficiency in humans, compromise recycling of glutathione and thioredoxin and so weaken antioxidant capacity and confer susceptibility toward oxidative insult [37]. SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, TRR, and NADPH producing enzymes together, therefore, increase the capacity of the cell to remove ROS through enzymatic means (Figure 3(b)). Cellular antioxidant defense is inducible and often up- regulated in response to oxidative stress or plant antioxidants. Cells sense and respond to changes in redox status by nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)/kelch-like ECH- associated protein 1 (Keap1) complex [38, 39], which when dissociated allows Nrf2 nuclear translation and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) to transactivate antioxidant enzymes and thus further elevate antioxidant capacity [40] (Figure 4). Under normal physiological condi- tions, transcription factor Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Keap1, which recruits ubiquitin ligase E3 that ubiquitinates 6 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity PCNA Restoration of genome integrity Genome instability/ genome heterogeneity DNA ligase ROS Indirect single-strand breakage (SSB) Seal of SSB Correct base/point mutation Translesion DNA synthesis Oxidized DNA base (e.g., 8-oxoG) Base excision repair Apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP site) AP endonuclease Family Y DNA polymerase PARP DNA glycosylase , D N A li ga se D N A p ol ym er as e Figure 5: Repair of oxidative DNA damage introduces genome heterogeneity and instability. ROS causes oxidation of DNA bases which then elicit base excision repair machineries. First, the oxidized base is cleaved by glycosylase leaving an apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP site). Second, the AP site is recognized by AP endonuclease that cleaves the phosphodiester bonds to remove the AP nucleotide and create the single-strand break (SSB) intermediate. DNA polymerase then resynthesizes the missing part of the DNA and later DNA ligase seals the nick. The low fidelity of the translesion DNA polymerase increases the chance of mismatched base-pairing and thus, leads to accumulation of point mutations which creates genome heterogeneity. Nrf2 and directs it to the proteasome degradation pathway. Increased levels of ROS promote the dissociation of Nrf2 and Keap1, either by the oxidization of key cysteine residues that govern Keap1 activity or via the activation of kinases (e.g., protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen activated protein- kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) [41], and protein kinase (PKR-) like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) that phosphorylate Nrf2 [42]. The dissociated Nrf2 then translocates into the nucleus and binds to the ARE. ARE-regulated genes, such as glutathione synthetase (GSS), GR, GPx, TRX, TRR, and peroxiredoxin (PRX) are then transcriptionally activated [40]. These inducible antioxidant enzymes provide further ROS clearance capacity and thus confer cytoprotective effects ensuing Nrf2 activation in response to oxidative stress stimulation during inflammation [43] or in the presence of redox-modulating phytoagents [44, 45] (Figure 4). As nonenzymatic and enzymatic control of ROS levels cannot guarantee perfect/complete protection against ROS damage, oxidative damage continues to occur and accu- mulate in cells. To alleviate the negative effects elicited by oxidized biomolecules, especially DNA, cells have evolved sophisticated specific enzymatic repair systems. One such system, base excision repair (BER), repairs oxidized DNA bases (Figure 5) [5]. During BER, the oxidized base is first recognized and removed by DNA glycosylase leaving an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site which is later recognized and cleaved by AP endonuclease on the phosphodiester backbone and leaves a DNA single-strand break (SSB) intermediate with a free 3-OH end. Subsequently, PPAR binds to the SSB and recruits DNA polymerase  and DNA ligase which synthesizes the missing nucleic acid and seals the SSB to restore genome integrity. Nonetheless, PCNA, a DNA clamp protein that associates with and coordinates the DNA repair pathway, facilitates a DNA polymerase switch to the special- ized Family Y DNA polymerase and increases the potential of generating point mutation. Family Y DNA polymerase carries out translesion DNA synthesis. The low fidelity of Family Y DNA polymerase introduces a higher frequency of mismatched base pairing than in regular DNA synthesis and therefore increases the incidence of point mutations [46, 47]. In the last step, DNA ligase seals the nick between the de novo synthesized nucleotide and adjacent nucleotides and com- pletes the base excision repair process. The point mutations Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 7 introduced during translesion DNA repair lead to genome heterogeneity between different cells and, chronologically, within the same cell (Figure 5). 3. ''Double-Edged Sword'' Role of Phytoagents as Redox Regulators in Cancer Management 3.1. Phytoagents in Cancer Management. Plants produce a remarkably diverse array of secondary metabolites (phyto- chemicals), many of which have evolved to combat microbial attack, resist environmental stress, or function as signal- ing molecules in interplant communication [48]. Human civilizations have used botanical preparations for treating and preventing various human diseases throughout history. Today, more than half of the anticancer drugs in clinical use are natural products or their derivatives and many are plant-derived phytochemicals [49, 50]. As cancer remains a major threat to health worldwide, there is global demand for more affordable and effective therapeutic alternatives. Moreover, concerns about drug resistance and the side effects of conventional therapeutic regimens currently used for cancer have renewed interest in phytochemicals derived from dietary foods and traditional medicines [51-55]. The US National Cancer Institute (NCI) has identified more than 1,000 different phytoextracts or phytochemicals that possess cancer-preventive activity [15] and the compo- nents responsible for many of the cancer chemopreventive effects of various edible plants have been determined. For example, the cancer preventive effects of allium species (e.g., garlic) and cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli and watercress) are attributed to organosulfur compounds (e.g., diallyl trisulfide) and isothiocyanates (e.g., sulforaphane (SFN) and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC)), respectively [56]. Other naturally occurring phytochemicals found in fruits, vegetables, spices, herbs, beverages, and medicinal plants, such as resveratrol [57], genistein [58], curcumin [59], (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) [60], and sesquiterpene lactones (e.g., deoxyelephantopin [61-63], artemisinin [64], and parthenolide) [65-67] have been reported to modulate multiple signaling cascades that are known to deregulate cancer cell activities [68]. Interestingly, these representative phytocompounds (Figure 6) exert their anticancer cell effects throughmodulating ROS activity and oxidative stress in can- cer cells by antioxidant, pro-oxidant, or a dual as antioxidant and prooxidant under certain physiological or pathological conditions. The important dual, seemingly oppositional role of phytoagents as redox regulators involved in nucleic acid oxidation in cancer cells, is discussed below. 3.2. Phytoagents as Antioxidants for Cancer Prevention. In general, phytoagents with antioxidant properties are poten- tially useful in cancer prevention because they can protect healthy cells fromoxidativeDNAdamage through direct rad- ical scavenging, upregulation of antioxidant defense system, metal ion chelation, and/or additional anti-inflammatory activity. The latest developments in the evaluation of the antioxidant effects and related defense systems or molecular mechanisms of phytocompounds, with focus on oxidative DNA damage as a biomarker in cancer prevention, are discussed below. 3.2.1. Major Antioxidant Mechanisms of Action of Phytoagents (a) Direct ROS Scavenging. Phytoagents can attenuate ROS insults on biomolecules through direct scavenging of ROS. "Scavenging" refers to direct chemical modification of ROS and their stabilization by chemical reduction or electron- donation. In this way, the reduced form of a phytoagent molecule is consumed to buffer injurious ROS that might otherwise cause DNA damage. Phytoagents might have different scavenging capacity for different ROS and free radical species. For example, vitamin E and the carotenes have long polyunsaturated fatty acid chains, while vitamin C, flavonoids, and polyphenols have ring structures. They all share one structural commonality: conjugated systems, characterized by intermittent single bonds and double bonds which together form aligned p orbitals where pi electrons canmove freely.The conjugated system can, therefore, donate electrons more easily and thus have high reducing capacity. This property gives these phytoagents ROS buffering capacity that protects important biomolecules from ROS attack. (b) Attenuation of the Fenton(-Like) Reaction by Direct Metal Ion Chelation. Oxidative damage is one of the main forms of toxicity conferred by transition metal ions. In the Fenton(- like) reaction, the reduced form of a transition metal ion catalyzes the generation of the highly reactive hydroxyl free radical from hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, the more free form transition metal ions there are, the more hydroxyl free radical formation occurs by the Fenton(-like) reaction, and the more serious the oxidative damage to biomolecules including DNA. Will be Phytoagents can attenuate Fenton(- like) reaction by reducing the level of transition metal ion. Through direct chelation by phytocompounds containing a catechol or galloyl structure, transition metal ions are sequestered from solution and therefore prevented from participating the Fenton(-like) reaction [69, 70]. This is another indirect way by which phytoagents exert antioxidant effects. (c) Induction of Antioxidant Response Element-Controlled Genes through Nrf2 Activation.Dietary levels of phytochemi- cals have been suggested to trigger induction of low levels of oxidative stress that may "prime" cellular antioxidant defense systems to resist higher levels of oxidative insults thus offering protection against carcinogenic insult [60]. These types of phytochemicals might have little antioxidant effect in vitro in terms of ROS scavenging capacity; nonetheless, in some cases, they activate themaster transcription factorNrf2which governs the expression of a set of antioxidant-related genes. Therefore, through activation of Nrf2 and the subsequent up- regulation of endogenous antioxidant defense, these phyto- chemicals confer antioxidant effects in an indirect way. Phytoagents from various structural categories have been shown to activate Nrf2 with varied potency [71]. In general, phytoagents with electrophilic groups that are thiol-reactive induce the most potent Nrf2 activation when compared based on fold of induction of Nrf2-regulated 8 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity O O OH OH HO OH O OH OH HO OH OH O OH OH HO OH O O OH OH OH OH O O O O O H H H OO O O O O O O O HO O HO O OH OH OH H N C S O O OH OO O HO OH OH HO N C S S O S S S S S S (b) Curcuminoids (A) Phenolics Quercetin (a) Flavonoids Catechin Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (c) Stilbenoids Resveratrol Curcumin Ascorbic acid (Vit.

They show free radical scavenging, Nrf2/ARE activation, and/or facilitation of ROS production in cancer cells. NADPH: quinone reductase [72]. Some phytoagents without electrophilic groups could also induce Nrf2, though to a lesser extent. These types of phytoagents might activate Nrf2 indirectly through modulating signaling pathways whereas thiol-reactive electrophiles can directly modify the redox- sensitive cysteine residues in theNrf2/Keap1 complex thereby promoting the dissociation of the complex and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. (d) Attenuation of Inflammation through Inactivation. NF-B is the master transcription factor that governs the expression of many inflammation-related genes. Notably, the activation Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity 9 of NF-B is redox-sensitive. High endogenous ROS level stimulates NF-B activation, which then leads to a pro- inflammatory response and further exacerbates the intracel- lular redox status [73-77]. Such a feedback loop mediated by redox-sensitive NF-B activation often leads to chronic inflammation, one of the hallmarks of cancer. Many phytoa- gents exhibiting an anti-inflammatory effect have been shown to efficiently suppress NF-B activation. Suppression of NF- B can be achieved by either the aforementioned antioxidant actions or through direct chemical modification of NF- B redox-sensitive cysteine residues by phytoagents with electrophilic groups, such as C=O, N=C=S or organosulfide groups to compromise its ability to translocate to the nucleus and bind DNA. 3.2.2. Antioxidant Effects and Defense Systems of Selected Phy- toagents. Vitamins and phenolics (two well-known groups of antioxidants), as well as electrophilic phytocompounds, are used below to exemplify the latest developments in the evaluation of the antioxidant effects and related defense systems of phytocompounds with a focus on oxidative DNA damage as a biomarker in cancer prevention. (a) Vitamins. The ability of macronutrients and micronutri- ents present in fruits and vegetables to reduce the risk of can- cer is well known. Among these compounds, the antioxidant vitamins and their precursors have been extensively studied [15]. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin E, and -carotene are often referred to as "antioxidant vitamins."
