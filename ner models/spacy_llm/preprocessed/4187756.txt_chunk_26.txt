On the one hand, Vietnam continues to struggle with what the WHO has called "an 195 unfinished agenda in infectious, vector-borne and communicable diseases" (2003: 3) including cholera, typhoid, dengue fever, malaria, plague, hepatitis B and encephalitis, while on the other they are coming to terms with "the adverse impact on health due to changes in lifestyles, environments and working conditions in the processes of industrialization and modernization" (Vietnam. Communist Party of Vietnam. 2005: II.1). According to the Ministry of Health, Vietnam is moving towards a new age of disease patterns, where the major problems will be "non-infectious diseases like cardiovascular diseases, cancer, accidents and injuries, diabetes, occupational diseases, mental diseases, poisoning, suicide and diseases caused by unhealthy lifestyles (drug addiction, alcoholism, obesity, etc.)" (Vietnam. Ministry of Health. 2001: 1b). Now, it is of course no coincidence that the revivals of herbal medicine in the United Kingdom and Vietnam are often explained with specific reference to this ongoing epidemiologic transition into an age of chronic disease and lifestyle-related illnesses. It is precisely in these areas that many herbal practitioners suggest a renewed relevance for their "holistic" and "less aggressive" remedies and treatments when compared to what are seen as the reductionist, toxic or symptom-busting biomedical treatments prescribed by biomedical GPs. Stress, indigestion, allergies, depression, addiction, obesity, cancer, musculoskeletal disorders and cardiovascular troubles are the epidemiological scourges of 'a modern way of life'. And their perceived perniciousness stems not just from potential mortality, but equally significantly from what is seen as their negative impact on a person's quality of life while he or she is experiencing or suffering from them. However much longer we might be living, herbalist Andrew Chevallier argues that "in our time, with ever-growing levels of emotional and mental stress, related perhaps to the breakdown of extended family and community ties, and to environmental pollution and degradation, people more and more need remedies that can support tired or 'burnt-out' nervous systems" (1999: 91). Fellow herbalist Michael McIntyre argues that "allergies seem to be on the increase... probably due to the many artificial chemical additives in commercial foods, as well as agricultural sprays" (1988: 90). Also Jonathan Zuess, in a St. John's Wort self-help guide, suggests that "our minds, bodies and spirits can't always adjust to the stressful and toxic lifestyles that we've come to consider normal in the late twentieth century" (1997: 13). Herbalist Simon Mills sums up the main argument: 196 Life expectancy has never been higher. Yet in spite of these advances, it is also accepted that diseases still exact their toll on us. We might live longer, but the arthritic deterioration, heart disease, cancer and pneumonia that are most likely to plague our final years increase accordingly and still elide isolation and elimination. Bacterial diseases may be largely gone but low-grade debilitating viral and immuno-deficient conditions are on the increase. And patient after patient turns away from their doctors and goes towards practitioners of alternative therapies because they say that the priest of rationalist scientific medicine either is no longer effective or does not even seem to be able to understand their story any more... [Herbalism's] renaissance in the modern world points to its filling a new need in its consumers... [but it] will never have a future unless it comes to terms with changes in medicine in the last century and provides its own coherent and credible perspective on them. (Mills 1993: 17) In Vietnam, multiple public health objectives in a recent national health programme reflect the persistence of different stages of disease patterns within the country, where people suffer from both infectious and lifestyle-related diseases. According to the Communist Party of Vietnam, the manifold goals of the government's health programme are "to reduce morbidity and mortality, promote health and increase life expectancy, improve the quality of our race [and] contribute to improving the quality of life... in response to the needs of industrialization, modernization, nation-building and defence" (Vietnam. Communist Party of Vietnam. 2005: I.2). We will recall from chapter 4 that such a diversified approach has been very relevant in national efforts to revitalise the practice and use of traditional herbal medicine. The "Doctor at Home" and "Drugs at Home" programmes, for example, have specifically targeted rural areas by promoting the cultivation of medicinal plants and home production of herbal remedies which are pertinent to the epidemiologic needs of Vietnam's rural populations (e.g. anti-dysentery, anti-infection and anti-tussive remedies). In more affluent, urban areas on the other hand, industrialised herbal remedies are produced and sold to cater for the specific epidemiologic make up of urban populations with vitality tonics making up the great majority of industrialised herbal remedies on the market (Bui 2004). Moreover, the National Hospital of Traditional Medicine in Hanoi has a number of departments dedicated to treating chronic disease and lifestyle illnesses, such as their Department of Acupuncture and Vitality Preservation, Drug Dependence Control Centre and Department of Geriatrics. Heantos itself, one of many industrialised herbal remedies against drug addiction launched in the 1990s (others include Hufusa and Cedemex), was developed to treat an affliction considered a "social evil" in Vietnam (together with prostitution and gambling). Their 197 increasing prevalence is linked by health authorities directly to unhealthy lifestyles brought about by modernisation and urbanisation.118 As summarised by the Communist Party in Vietnam: "newly emerging social problems such as environmental pollution and social evils are exerting an adverse impact on people's health;... the population size of our country will continue to grow in the coming years, and people's healthcare needs will be higher and more diversified" (Vietnam. Communist Party of Vietnam. 2005). And so, building up a "specifically Vietnamese medicine" (Huu and Borton 2003: 13) pertains not only to combining modern and traditional medicine, but also to addressing the epidemiological diversity found within Vietnam's borders. Interestingly, in both countries, a kind of division of competences between modern and herbal medicine has begun to take form. Although the National Institute of Medical Herbalists in the United Kingdom stakes a strong claim for herbal medicine in treating "almost any condition that patients might take to their doctor", they also emphasise that "qualified herbalists know when a condition is best seen by a doctor or another therapist" (NIMH 2004b). And herbalists Mills and McIntyre both argue that "modern patients with a life-threatening pathology are in much better hands with a modern physician than they could have been with any from earlier generations" and that "the value of modern medicine in coping with acute or life-threatening disease is plain to see" (McIntyre 1988: 30; Mills 1993: 20). Similarly, in Vietnam, Bui (1999: 30) has argued that: traditional medicine is more gentle, acts progressively and for this reason, in emergency cases, must come second after classical treatment methods (modern medicine). However, when the critical phase has been overcome, traditional medicine offers incontestable advantages. In urban areas of Vietnam, Huu suggests that "moderately Westernised Vietnamese favour a combination of traditional and modern medicine; they believe modern medicine is better in the treatment of microbial diseases and in surgery, while traditional medicine works best for non-microbial diseases, functional disorders and general exhaustion" (Huu and Borton 2003: 21).119 118 Opium addiction is of course not a new phenomenon in Vietnam, but there is no question that urban youth are increasingly seen as succumbing to the vices of a 'westernised' lifestyle in the cities of Vietnam - "Heroin is the most common drug used, especially among young users, and especially in urban areas" (see UNODC 2005). 119 Taylor has argued a similar point in the recent history of Chinese medicine: "In modern Chinese society, in those areas of life where the use of Chinese medicine is optional, Chinese medicine appears to continue to 198 Now, it is crucial to point out that I am of course not in any way suggesting that as herbal medicine has come to be bio-politicised and normalised, herbal practitioners and users have ceased understanding and working on various ailments in terms of patterns of disharmonies in the flow of vital energies - as we saw in previous chapters, the concepts of khi and vis medicatrix naturae continue to be central to Vietnamese and British herbalists' accounts of the workings of herbal medicine. Rather, what I am arguing is that we cannot account for the revival or renaissance of traditional herbal medicine in Vietnam or the UK without understanding the health problems to which they have been proposed as a solution to in recent decades. In both cases, these health problems have in large part emerged out of particular socio-economic and epidemiologic problematisations, and it is qua their applicability in treating them that traditional herbal medicine is promoted by herbalists and/ or public health officials.120 Even if traditional herbal remedies continue to be prescribed and used in order to rectify disharmonious patterns of vital energy or imbalances in pulses and flows of vital energy considered individual to each patient, these imbalances and disharmonies are nevertheless explicitly and firmly placed into a context of dramatic epidemiologic transitions, which it is argued have occurred/are ongoing in both countries. In an important sense, it is the processes of modernisation that are held responsible for disturbing these energy flows and thereby for negatively impacting the quality and length of life of populations. And it is precisely in this context that herbal medicine has been accorded a public health value in both countries.121 And so, while it is the stress and harmful lifestyles associated with 'a modern way of life' that are seen to be disrupting vital energy resonances, flows or pulses in ways particular to each patient in affluent areas of the United Kingdom and Vietnam and making them amenable to herbal treatments, it is to treat the infectious and communicable diseases that thrive in squalid living conditions that Vietnamese herbal medicine has in particular been harnessed in the more rural areas of Vietnam. Yet as I have already suggested, this very much corporeal component of human vitality - where the life mechanisms of the body are function on a level of general well-being and for the treatment of minor illnesses. In cases of distress, Chinese medicine comes a resounding second to the more popular Western medicine" (2005: 152-3). 120 This is the point I made in the preceding chapter with Heantos and St. John's Wort, which have been promoted as herbal remedies against addiction and depression respectively, even if their scope is considered much broader by herbalists. 121 Not of course by all, as there are without doubt those who question any such claims of a public health value (see chapter 4). 199 seen to be disrupted either by communicable, viral or lifestyle-related diseases (in a biomedical sense) or by blockages, disharmonies or imbalances in the flows of vital energies (in a vitalistic sense) - is but one component of life today; a component which specifically pertains to longevity. As we will see in the following, however, not only is herbal medicine used to target the life mechanisms of the body, it is also explicitly mobilised to improve the quality of this corporeal life, which is to say the ways in which temporal longevity is experienced, enjoyed, taken advantage of and/or coped with. Body mechanics and soul mechanics As pointed out in the opening pages of this dissertation, there have in particular been two forms of critiques against modern medicine voiced by many practitioners of herbal medicine, not to mention of other forms of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine. Firstly, even if it is conceded that modern medicine has been successful in the treatment of a number of acute and life-threatening conditions, it is nevertheless maintained that modern medicines are "toxic", "aggressive" and prone to side effects (see Bui 1999; Hoang 1999; McIntyre 1988; NIMH 2004b), all of which negatively impact on a patient's quality of life. Whatever gains in longevity, these are often seen as offset by losses in quality of life during the course of a treatment. And so, in cases of chronic (vs. acute) and lifestyle-related (vs. infectious) diseases, it is argued that herbal medicines have an incontestable advantage over modern medicines because they are more "gentle", "natural" and have almost no side effects (see chapter 4 for all the caveats that such generalisations entail). Indeed, it is even suggested that herbal medicines can be used to ameliorate the negative effects of modern medicines as, for example, in Vietnam "the utilisation of medicinal plants prepared in the form of infusions, tablets, syrups and so on is indicated for some patients suffering side effects from chemical remedies" (Bui 1999: 29-30). And so, even if a herbal medicine's efficacy turns out to be more or less comparable to that of a modern medicine in the treatment of a particular condition (as has been the case with St. John's Wort and Heantos), a herbal medicine is considered preferable by virtue of its superior safety profile. These kinds of critiques of modern medicine are what I have summed up as life-enfeeblement critiques. While they do not necessarily suggest that modern medicines are killing us (e.g. chemotherapy can prolong life although often with very painful side effects), they do suggest that modern medicines can and often do diminish our experience of corporeal life. 200 Secondly, it is argued that by exactly having specialised in life-threatening pathologies, "modern doctors have relinquished the shamanistic or priestly role of addressing the patient's whole world and have sought a specialist job as body mechanics" (Mills 1993: 21). Moreover, this relinquishment is seen as having been exacerbated by increasingly bureaucratised and technologised modern health delivery systems, which are by now routinely derided for having lost sight of the humans they were supposed to be healing. In today's age of increasing chronic and man-made diseases, it is argued that soul mechanics have become just as important as body mechanics. Whereas modern medicine is seen as having pretty much exclusively focused on the corporeal life mechanisms of patients, and in doing so encouraging a certain passivity and docility of them,122 herbal medicine is seen to provide patients with not just medications and practical lifestyle advice, but also a framework of meaning with which patients can understand and relate to their particular conditions. As Mills has put it, "the beginning of an answer to the patient's most pressing question about his or her illness: 'Why me?'" (1993: 22) and as Huu has put it, a way of "thinking" about illness (2003: 19). It is with the help of these medications, lifestyle techniques and frameworks of meaning that herbal medicine assists patients in coping and dealing with the health-related problems of their lives, including those stemming from the negative effects of modern living. That is to say, as much as herbal medicine is a technology for optimising the life mechanisms of patients (whether construed in vitalistic or mechanistic terms) it is also seen as a technology for affecting and optimising the coping mechanisms, lifestyle skills and human capabilities of patients. A herbalist, according to the Association of Master Herbalists in the UK, is "not only therapist and healer but also teacher and instructor, informing and guiding clients to the fulfilment of their well-being... In addition to [prescribing] herbal medicines, practitioners assist clients to look after themselves through correct nutrition, appropriate exercise, and through other natural healing techniques such as the use of water in hydrotherapy" (AMH 2006). And in Vietnam, it is argued that traditional medicine is not only about ensuring longevity, but is also about promoting "awareness of good nutrition", 122 As pointed out in Chapter 1, while there has clearly been a tendency to equate a 'holistic approach' to medicine with TM and CAM therapies, it is simply not tenable to suggest that there can be no such thing as a 'holistic approach' to biomedicine (see Armstrong 1984; Watt and Wood 1988). Indeed, Armstrong has shown how at least since the 1950s biomedical doctors have come to address the 'patient's view' as a therapeutic site in its own right in terms of 'coping' and 'adjustment' (1984: 741). Nevertheless, holistic-reductionist divides continue to be invoked by many practitioners of herbal medicine to distinguish their form of practice from that of modern medicine. 201 ensuring "a healthy mental life" and minimising "psychological trauma" (Hoang 1999: 228). This, then, is the neo-vitalism that has allowed for the emergence of quality of life as a crucial object of life optimisation by making subsistence and existence two separate yet inherently interrelated components of life. In this neo-vitalistic configuration of bio-power, to live is certainly as a minimum to biologically subsist (including having the socio-economic means to do so), but it is at the same time more than that. It is also to experience and enjoy that life, to cope with its vicissitudes (be they seen as bacterial, hereditary, genetic, viral, toxic, neurochemical, traumatic, psychosomatic or khi-energetic in origin), to unfold the human subjectivity potentials that it makes possible, and indeed to be able to function in ways requisite to a healthy subsistence and a healthy existence. Human life itself becomes, in a sense, the cold flesh that is to be (re)vitalised with 'quality', as biology (quantity of life) and subjectivity (quality of life) become inescapably interlinked. That is to say, not only are there bodies to be (biomedically) repaired or (herbally) rebalanced, there are also 'deadened' and/or 'disoriented' subjectivities to be rescued and/or stabilised. It is in this way that I suggest 'quality of life' could emerge out of modernisation critiques123 to become a concrete target of overall life-administering operations, making life itself and human subjectivity itself inseparable objects of life optimising interventions.124 If there is 'mere' life in neo-vitalistic terms then it is the mere fact of subsisting, understood as anatomical and biological mechanisms of longevity. A complete, full, optimal, good or enjoyable life, on the other hand, is one that has been imbued with quality, and it therefore requires persistent work not only on the subsistence of populations and individuals, but also on their existence. If subsistence can be thought of as biological life (again, whether vitalistically or mechanistically construed), then existence - that is to say experiencing, coping, enjoying, unfolding human potential - is anthropological/psychological life.
