Karim Received: 1 July 2009 /Accepted: 24 August 2009 /Published online: 16 September 2009 # Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009 Abstract Minerals and heavy metal concentrations of 23 plants (arial parts, leaves, bark, stem, root, rhizome, dried berries, seeds) possessing health-promoting effects and used in indigenous medicines (as medicinal food) were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic spectrometry. Vital essential minerals and heavy metals were present in all the samples analyzed. The majority of the plant materials were rich in some of the essential minerals like Na, K, Ca, Fe, Mg, Cu, Mn, and Zn, which are known to be beneficial for health. The plant material of Vitiveria zizinalis had highest concentration of toxic heavy metals, including arsenic (53.1 mg/100 g), chromium (6.74 mg/100 g), cobalt (10.2 mg/100 g), mercury (3.6 mg/100 g), and nickel (3.28 mg/100 g). Results of the present study provide vital data on the availability of some essential minerals, which can be useful to provide dietary information for designing value-added foods and for food biofortification. Apart from this, data on the contam- inant levels of heavy metals highlights the necessity on the quality and safety concerns about their use. Keywords Minerals . HeavyMetals . Nutraceuticals . Quality . Safety Introduction Plants and their products have always played a substantial role in human welfare by satisfying various essential needs ranging from food to medicines. Currently, functional foods or the nutraceuticals of plant origin have gained in popularity and constitute a major share of the health care market (Bhat and Sridhar 2008; Bhat and Karim 2009). Today, consumers are quite practical and choosy in their approach to diet; they are interested in incorporating high nutrient levels with adequate amount of essential minerals into their normal diet, preferably with sources from plant origin. The expansion of the mineral supplement industry is a direct indication of the gaining importance of minerals to consumers. In this regard, interest has grown in finding traditionally consumed plant products (e.g. herbs, spices) that might not only have culinary and medicinal properties but that also are abundant in essential micronutrients. Most of the minerals, even at threshold levels, contribute significantly to normal growth and play a pivotal role in biochemical functions and essential enzyme systems. Plant products play a significant role in traditional medicine systems, and the majority of consumers have the misconception that these products are inherently safe for consumption. However, there is concern among researchers that plants might accumulate heavy metals at significantly high levels when grown in polluted soil (Kalac and Svoboda 2000). If true, this will reflect the failure of good agricultural and manufacturing practices and quality assur- ance. Purity issues of plant-based drugs are also of high concern (Mazzanti et al. 2008). Hence, studying the R. Bhat (*) :A. A. Karim Food Technology Division, School of Industrial Technology, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Penang, Malaysia e-mail: rajeevbhat@usm.my K.

Methods (2010) 3:181-187 DOI 10.1007/s12161-009-9107-y presence of unwanted heavy metals and their concentrations in plant species used as traditional medicines and recom- mended to be incorporated in the normal food is a necessity. Of late, numerous efforts have been made to determine the mineral and heavy metal contents of herbal, medicinal, and aromatic plants, vegetables, and even wines from various parts of the world (Aberoumand and Deokule 2009; Galgano et al. 2008; Lavilla et al. 1999; Miller-Cebert et al. 2009; Tuzen et al. 2007). Trace elements and heavy metals have certain health benefits at lower concentrations, but at higher levels, they can be toxic and pose health risks (Schumacher et al. 1991); thus, it is important to determine the levels of these compounds in common, popular, and widely used herbal plants (or as medicinal foods). Detection of mineral and heavy metal concentrations in various foods has been conducted mainly using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) with flame atomiza- tion and a graphite furnace. However, other alternative, more reliable, and accurate methods are available, such as: inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, neutron activation analysis, and X-ray fluorescence methods (Knapp 1991). In this study, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used as this is a multi-element technique which allows fast and accurate analysis of nearly 75 elements of the periodic table. The major objective of this study was to evaluate and provide baseline information on the mineral composition and heavy metal contents of some popular and commer- cially valuable plants from the Indian market that possess high nutraceutical value. If at least a few of the plants were found to have high mineral contents, they might have the potential to be used for biofortification and development of new food products. Materials and Methods Sample Collection and Identification Certain common and popular plant materials that have therapeutic and nutraceutical value and are used in indigenous ayurvedic medicines were purchased from a leading local market dealer (from Mysore, India). The samples purchased were freshly harvested ones (less than 2 weeks) with no apparent physical damage. The materials (a total of 23 plants consisting of arial parts, leaves, bark, stem, root, rhizome, dried berries, seeds) were air dried at room temperature (25+-1degC) and ground into fine powder in a mortar and pestle to avoid chromium contamination from stainless steel utensils. The powder was placed temporarily in air-tight polyethylene pouches until further analysis. The identity of the plant material was confirmed with assistance from local practitioners and botanists. Table 1 lists the common name, scientific name, family, parts used, and the medicinal/health-promoting effects of the plant materials used in this study. Preparation and Analysis The minerals and heavy metal [aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), mercury (Hg), potassium (K), sodium (Na), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn)] contents of the powdered samples were deter- mined using the AOAC (1990) method. Briefly, a known amount of the sample was digested with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and perchloric acid (10:0.5:2, v/v), and the analysis was conducted using the ICP-OES (Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, USA). Table 2 lists the conditions and parameters used. All the glassware were cleaned by soaking overnight in a 10% nitric acid solution and then rinsing three times with deionized water. Statistical Analysis Analysis of minerals and heavy metals were performed in replicates, and data are presented as mean+-SD (n=3) with one-way analysis of variance (significance level at P<0.05) was performed with statistical software (ORIGIN(r), version 6.0, Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Results and Discussion Table 3 depicts the mineral and heavy metal concentrations of the samples analyzed in this study. Values varied widely among samples, but in general, most samples were rich in the following essential minerals: Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, and Zn. These minerals serve as structural components of tissues, function in cellular and basal metabolism, and help maintain water and acid-base balance (Smith 1988). The abundances of K, Mg, and Ca agree with earlier data from many of the plant specimens (Lavilla et al. 1999). Artemisia vulgaris had the highest levels of Ca (3,441.8 mg/100 g), whereas Annona squamosa had the lowest (3.72 mg/100 g). Ca is a major component of bone, assists in tooth development, helps regulate endo- and exo- enzymes, and plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure (Brody 1994). Using plant-based Ca as a nutri- tional supplement might be advantageous for consumers who are allergic to animal-based food sources or who practice strict vegetarianism. Cu was the highest in Berberis aristata (134.96 mg/100 g) and lowest in Sida cordifolia (0.05 mg/100 g). Vitiveria 182 Food Anal.

Methods (2010) 3:181-187 183 zizinalis had the highest concentrations of Fe and Zn (6,413.3 and 5.93 mg/100 g, respectively). Deficiency of zinc and iron in the diet is a widespread problem and a matter of great concern, especially in developing countries where people rely more on vegetarian diets. These essential trace elements are involved with vital immune system (Zn) and metabolic functions and are intrinsic components of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome (Fe) (Hemalatha et al. 2007). Hence, further study of V. zizinalis might prove this species to be a useful dietary supplement to provide Zn and Fe, especially for vegetarians. Piper longum had the highest potassium content (1,352.3 mg/100 g), Anethum sowa had the highest sodium concentration (170.69 mg/100 g), and Rauvolfia serpentina had the highest Mn concentration (856.4 mg/100 g). Perry (1972) reported a correlation between therapeutic properties of Cr and Mn in plants with diabetic and cardiovascular diseases. Plant materials with high concentrations of the above-mentioned micronutrient elements will definitely play an important role in maintenance of human health when taken at recommended levels. Earlier research on humans and livestock has shown that optimal intakes of elements such as Na, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu, and Zn can reduce individual risk factors for health problems such as cardiovascular disease (Mertz 1982; Sanchez- Castillo et al. 1998). Mayer and Vyklicky (1989) reported that these elements play a significant role in neurochemical transmission and also serve as constituents of biological molecules as a cofactor for various enzymes and in a variety of different metabolic processes. Minerals like Fe, Zn, and Mn are also recognized to be potential antioxidants (Talwar et al. 1989), which are involved in strengthening the immune system. Similarly, Mg, and Zn are known to prevent cardiomyopathy, muscle degeneration, growth retardation, alopecia, dermatitis, immunological dysfunction, gonadal atrophy, impaired spermatogenesis, congenital malforma- tions, and bleeding disorders (Chaturvedi et al. 2004). Monitoring the presence and concentrations of heavy metals in plants/herbs used for medicinal and health- promoting effects is crucial because these levels can be used as an indicator of the surrounding pollution and because they can have ill effects when consumed directly. According to Schilcher et al. (1987), the presence of toxic metals in the environment is quite varied and depends on various factors, such as pollution from industrial and traffic emissions, the use of purification mud and agricultural expedients such as Cd-containing dung and the use of organic Hg fungicides and insecticides containing lead arsenate. In the present study, the heavy metals Al, Ba, Cd, and Mo were not detectable, and lead was present but below detection levels in all samples analyzed. In contrast, As, Co, Cr, and Ni were detected in almost all samples, but they were present in low concentrations (Table 3). The concen- trations of As and Co were highest in V. zizinalis, (53.1 and 10.2 mg/100 g, respectively), and this was the only plant material that was positive for the presence of Hg (3.6 mg/ 100 g). Arsenic is considered to be one of the most toxic elements, and the provisional tolerance (weekly intake) is Table 2 Operating conditions of the ICP-OES Parameters Specifications Analysis mode Normal Rinsing time Fixed (5.0 s) Rinsing pump speed High speed Transfer time 10.0 s Stabilization time 5.0 s Transfer pump speed Normal Delay of synchronization 0 s Stop of pump during replacement No Power 1,000 W Normal speed of pump 20 Plasma gas flow rate 12 L/min Sheath gas flow rate 0.2 L/min Auxiliary flow rate 0.0 Sheath gas stability time 3.0 s Nebulization flow rate 0.02 Nebulization pressure 1.0 bar Sample uptake 1 mL/min Argon humidifier No Table 1 (continued) Botanical name Common/English name Family Parts used Therapeutic uses +Cinnamomum Tamala Buch.
