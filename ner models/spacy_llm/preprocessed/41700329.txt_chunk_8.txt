A study of the anti-malarial activity of the leaf extracts of B. pilosa using a combination of phytochemistry and bioassays showed that compound 49 (Table 11) showed activity against a malaria parasite (P. falciparum NF54 strain) with an IC 50 value of 6.0 g/mL [77]. In addition, compound 49, isolated from the aerial parts of B. pilosa, inhibited growth of the P. falciparum FCR-3 strain with an IC 50 value of 0.35 g/mL. This compound was tested for its in vivo effect in mice infected with P. berghei NK-65 strain. Results showed that compound 49 decreased the average parasitemia in the red blood cells by 20.7 (from 32.8% of that of the control to 12.1%) after an intravenous injection of 0.8mg/kg BW/day for four days [47]. Further studies addressing the anti-malarial mechanism underlying both polyynes and clinical studies are needed. 3.7. Antibacterial Activity. Emergence of multiple antibiotic- resistantmicrobes is becoming a global threat to public health and a challenge to disease treatment. For instance, penicillin is commonly used to combat a food-borne intracellular bacteriumListeria; however, penicillin-resistant bacteria have been discovered recently [69]. Chang and coworkers iso- lated centaurein (110) and centaureidin (109) from B. pilosa extract [69, 70]. Centaurein enhances expression of IFN-, a key cytokine for macrophage activation and, consequently, enhances bactericidal activity in macrophages [69, 70]. In agreement with observed in vitro effects, centaurein was reported to prevent and treat Listeria infection in C57BL/6J mice [91]. Mechanistic studies confirmed that centaurein exerted antilisterial action via IFN- expression in wild-type mice but not IFN- knockout mice [91]. Further in vitro studies on centaurein showed that this compound increased IFN- expression by 13% (from 17% to 20%), 20% (from 21% to 41%), and 11% (from 6% to 17%) in CD4+ T cells, CD8+T cells, and NK cells, respectively. That is to say, there was an increase in IFN- producing immune cells. As expected, centaurein also enhanced the expression level of T-bet, a key nuclear factor for IFN- expression. Consistently, centaurein augmented the serum IFN- levels inC57BL/6Jmice, and this augmentation peaked 24 hours after compound injection. The quantity of mouse serum IFN- was sufficient to activate macrophages in vitro and eradicated GFP-producing Listeria inside macrophages. However, the entry of Listeria into macrophages was not affected by centaurein-treated mouse sera. Centaurein treatment at 20g per mouse rescued 30% of the mice infected with a lethal dose of Listeria (2 x 106 CFU). It is noteworthy that in the presence of ampicillin (5 g/mouse), centaurein (20 g/mouse) rescued 70% of the mice, suggesting an additive effect between ampicillin and centaurein [91]. Despite lower abundance, centaureidin was Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 45 30 times more active than centaurein in terms of IFN- production [91]. Aside from the indirect antibacterial action mentioned above, extract and/or compounds of B. pilosa also showed direct bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal action. One study reported that essential oils and leaf/flower extracts of B. pilosa could suppress the growth of gram positive and gram negative bacteria as evidenced by zone of inhibition assays. In this study, antibacterial activity of the essential oils from the leaves and flowers of B. pilosa was determined in an attempt to identify natural products as food preservatives for prevention of microbial multiplication and food oxidation. The essential oils and extracts of B. pilosa leaves and flow- ers showed moderate but different extents of antibacterial activity (Table 17). In general, essential oils had higher antibacterial activity than crude extracts. One explanation for this could be that monoterpenes in the essential oils destroy cellular integrity and, subsequently, inhibit the respiration and ion transport processes. The presence of antibacterial -caryophyllene could be another explanation as reported elsewhere [92]. Another study reported that the methanol and acetone extract of B. pilosa roots displayed antibacterial activities against the bacteria listed in Table 18 [93] and methanol extracts from the roots seemed to be the most effective. Another study indicated that the polyyne, (R)-1,2- dihydroxytrideca-3,5,7,9,11-pentayne (49), from this plant also suppressed bacterial growth as shown by the minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit 50% bacterial growth (MIC 50 ) in Table 19. This compound was highly effective against several Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria including the drug-resistant bacteria Staphylococcus aureus N315 (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecalis NCTC12201 (VRE) [47]. Strikingly, compound 49 had a similar MIC 50 value to antibiotics (ampicillin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, and amphotericin B) in most of the bacteria tested. Antibacterial activity of B. pilosa extracts and compo- nents, expressed as MIC 50 and the mean zone of inhibition, is tabulated in Tables 17, 18, and 19.The zone of inhibition for Ampicilline (positive control) ranges from 15.3 +- 0.3mm to 44.3 +- 0.2mm [92]. 3.8. Antifungal Activity. B. pilosa has traditionally been used to treat microbial infection. Recently, different parts of B. pilosa have been tested for antifungal activities. Deba and colleagues first evaluated the antifungal effect of the hot water extracts of the B. pilosa roots, stems, and leaves against Corticium rolfsii, Fusarium solani, and Fusarium oxysporum. They discovered that C. rolfsii was most suppressed by treatment with B. pilosa as its growth was reduced at almost all the tested doses, followed by F. oxysporum and F. solani [99]. However, the fungicidal activities of the stems, and roots were greater than the leaves [99]. Moreover, the same group assessed the antifungal activity of the essential oils and aqueous extracts from B. pilosa flowers and leaves [92]. They showed that the extracts and oils had antifungal activity against C. rolfsii, F. solani, and F. oxysporum. Essential oils appeared to have better fungicidal activity thanwater extracts as summarized in Table 20. Another study by Ashafa and colleagues showed that acetone, methanol, and water extracts of the B. pilosa roots showed antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, and Penicillium notatum using the agar dilution method. The results are tabulated in Table 21 [93]. Negative controls showed 0% growth inhibition.The methanol extract of the B. pilosa roots at 10mg/mL was also effective against Candida albicans [93].Of note, B. pilosa obtained fromPapua New Guinea had no activity against A. niger and C. albicans [126], but the SouthAfrican (EasternCape) ecotype exhibited moderate activity against C. albicans [93]. This discrepancy may depend on extraction solvents, extraction procedure, assay techniques, different plant parts, and abundance of active compounds. B. pilosa produces a variety of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, phenylacetylenes, alkaloids, sterols, ter- penoids, and tannis [92, 93]. However, none of them have been confirmed as active compounds against fungi. Further investigation of active compounds from B. pilosa is necessary to further understand the antifungal efficacy of this plant. 3.9. Hypotensive and Vasodilatory Activities. In early studies, Dimo and colleagues used three rat models, normotensive Wistar rats (NTR), salt-loading hypertensive rats (SLHR), and spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) to investigate the hypotensive effect of the methanol crude extract of B. pilosa leaves [28, 127]. The extract lowered systolic blood pressure in hypertensive rats (SLHR and SHR) to a greater degree than NTR [28, 127]. In addition, a decrease in urinary sodium ions and an increase in urinary potassium ions were observed after treatment with the methanol extract of B. pilosa leaves although neither differences were statistically significant [28, 127]. Taking the data together, the study proposed that B. pilosa leaf extract reduced blood pressure via vasodilation [28, 127]. The same group continued to test the antihypertensive effect of aqueous and methylene chloride extracts of B. pilosa leaves in a hypertensive rat model [28, 127]. To establish a fructose-induced hypertension model, male Wistar rats were given 10% fructose solution to drink ad libitum for three weeks. In addition to free access to 10% fructose, the rats were treated with the aqueous (150mg/kg) or methyl chloride (350mg/kg) extracts of B. pilosa for additional three weeks [28, 127]. Both extracts of B. pilosa leaves had a hypotensive effect on rats. However, neither extracts reversed the elevation of serum insulin in fructose-fed rats. Therefore, B. pilosa lowered blood pressure irrespective of insulin [28, 127]. To better understand the hypotensive mechanism, the authors investigated the effect of a neutral extract of B. pilosa (NBP), a mixture of methanol andmethylene chloride (1 : 1) extract after neutralization with NaOH and HCl, on the heart and the blood pressure of NTR and SHR [110]. This study showed that an intravenous injection of the NBP resulted in a biphasic reduction in systolic blood pressure. In addition, one intravenous dose of the extract at 10, 20, and 30mg/kg BW decreased systolic blood pressure in normal rats by 18.3%, 42.5%, and 30%, 46 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine respectively, and the same doses reduced the blood pressure in hypertensive rats by 25.8%, 38.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. Only the highest dose (30mg/kg) affected the force of the contraction of the heart. Atropine and propranolol were used to interfere with the hypotensive action of the NBP. Atropine reduced the initial phase of the hypotensive response in NBP and completely abolished the second phase of hypotensive response in NBP. In contrast, propranolol increased the first hypotensive response but partially abolished the second hypotensive response provoked by the NBP [110].This mech- anistic study suggested that B. pilosa invokes the biphasic hypotensive responses via targeting cardiac pump efficiency during the first phase and vasodilation at the second phase [110]. A further study was performed to investigate the relaxing effect of a neutral extract of B. pilosa (NBP) on rat aorta con- tractedwithKCl (60mM) andnorepinephrine (0.1mM) [94]. Cumulative addition of NBP relaxed the rat aorta previously contracted by KCl in a dose-dependent manner. The EC 50 value of theNBP for vasorelaxationwas 0.32mg/mL.Thedata also showed that the NBP reduced the contraction of aorta previously contracted by KCl irrespective of the presence of aortic endothelium [94]. Pretreatment with glibenclamide, an ATP-dependent K+ channel blocker, did not considerably affect the relaxant effect of the NBP on KCl-induced contraction, suggesting that the vasodilatory effect of B. pilosa was not related to the opening of this ATP-dependent K+ channel [94]. On the other hand, in the presence of indomethacin or pyrilamine maleate, the relaxant response induced by the plant extract was significantly inhibited at the lower concentrations. The plant extract was able to reduce the aorta resting tone, inhibit the KCl-induced contractions by 90% at 1.5mg/mL and the CaCl 2 -induced contractions by 95% at 0.75mg/mL. These results demonstrate that B. pilosa can act as a vasodilator probably via acting as a calcium antagonist [94]. However, no specific compound for the above activity has been identified from B. pilosa to date. A bioactivity- guided identification approach may be adopted to identify the active compounds in B. pilosa that possess hypotensive and vasodilatory effects and understand their mechanism of action. 3.10. Wound Healing Activity. B. pilosa has been traditionally used to treat tissue injury inCameroon, Brazil, andVenezuela [26]. Hassan and colleagues investigated the wound healing potential of B. pilosa in Wistar rats [128]. Mirroring the positive control neomycin sulfate, the ethanol extract of B. pilosa had faster wound closure than control rats 3, 6, and 9 days after topical application. Histological examination also revealed better collagenation, angiogenesis, and organization of wound tissue seven days after application. Epithelialization and total healing time in B. pilosa-treated rats were compara- ble to those of neomycin sulfate. Together, these data suggest that B. pilosa may be a viable alternative to neomycin lotion for the treatment of wounds. In addition to studying the wound healing effect of B. pilosa on external ulcers, Tan and colleagues also examined the effect of methanol, cyclohexane, and methyl chloride extracts of B. pilosa on gastric ulcers in Wistar rats fed with 1mL HCl/ethanol gastric necrotizing solution (150mM HCl in 60% ethanol), and macroscopically visible lesions were scored [26]. Among the three extracts, methylene chlo- ride extracts exhibited the highest activity showing 46.4% inhibition of lesion formation at a dose of 500mg/kg BW and complete inhibition at 750mg/kg [26]. The efficacy of the ethylene chloride extract was followed by that of the methanol extracts which had inhibition ranging from 30.4% to 82.2% at concentrations of 500mg/kg and 1000mg/kg BW, respectively [26]. The cyclohexane extracts showed the lowest activity against gastric ulcers in rats with 13.3%, 40%, and 79.7% inhibition at 500, 750, and 1000mg/kg BW, respectively [26]. To better understand the mode of action of the methylene chloride extract of B. pilosa, rats were pretreated with indomethacin, a COX-2 inhibitor involved in prostaglandin synthesis. Pretreatment significantly reduced the protection against HCl/ethanol-induced ulcers to 31.3% inhibition at 750mg/kg BW, suggesting a link between the antiulcerative activity of B. pilosa and prostaglandin syn- thesis. Unexpectedly, the methylene chloride extract of B. pilosa showed little gastric mucosal protection against gastric lesions induced by 95% ethanol (1mL) [26]. Absolute alcohol is known to cause mucosal/submucosal tissue destruction via cellular necrosis and the release of tissue-derived mediators (histamine and leukotrieneC4).Thus, these data imply thatB. pilosa did not prevent the generation or the necrotic action of these mediators on the gastric microvasculature. In addition, pylorus ligation can increase gastric acid secretion without an alteration of mucosal histamine content. The methylene chloride extract of B. pilosa did not possess antisecretory activity. On the contrary, it was observed that increases in the dose of the extract led to elevated gastric juice acidity [26]. Results with both absolute ethanol and pylorus ligation rat models suggested the possibility that the ineffectiveness of B. pilosa against gastric ulcers was due to lack of antihistaminic activity in the plant. In summary, overall the data suggest that B. pilosa protects against HCL/ethanol-mediated ulcers via inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis. Previous phytochemical studies showed that a group of flavonoids, acyclichalcones, are present in B. pilosa [129, 130] and the chalcones were proposed to have anti- ulcerative activity [131]. Moreover, nine hydroxychalcones 10 were reported to possess gastric cytoprotective effects with 2,4-dihydroxychalcone being the most active [132]. Since methylene chloride extracts appear to be the most active B. pilosa extracts, next, the specific anti-ulcerative phytochemi- cals in the methylene chloride extracts of B. pilosa and their modes of action needs to be probed. Despite the claims listed inTable 3, relatively few scientific studies have been conducted in vitro and in vivo to address the traditional ethnomedical uses of B. pilosa. Information about the use of B. pilosa as a botanical therapy recorded so far is far from complete. Studies conducted thus far only serve as a starting point for further investigation of B. pilosa, and the ultimate efficacious use of the herb in clinical applications. Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 47 4. Toxicology Despite its use as an ingredient in food for human con- sumption, studies on systemic toxicity (e.g., acute, subacute, chronic and subchronic toxicities) of B. pilosa in humans and animals are still inadequate and insufficient. So far, acute, and/or subchronic toxicities have been evaluated in rats and mice. Oral acute and 28-day toxicities of water extract of B. pilosa leaves were evaluated in Wistar rats [133]. An oral dose of water extract of B. pilosa leaves at 10 g/kg BW showed no obvious mortality or changes in the appearance in rats [134]. The same extract at 0.8 g/kg BW/day, once a day, showed no obvious sub-chronic toxicity in rats over 28 days, as measured by survival rate, body weight, and gross examination of organs [134].
