of action, it was hypothesized that cytopiloyne protects
NOD mice from diabetes by a generalized suppression of
adaptive immunity. To evaluate this hypothesis, ovalbumin
(Ova) was used as a T-cell dependent antigen to prime
NOD mice, which had already received cytopiloyne or
PBS vehicle. Ova priming boosted similar anti-Ova titers
in cytopiloyne-treated mice and PBS-treated mice, but a
difference in immunoglobulin isotype was observed in the
two groups. Thus, it was concluded that cytopiloyne is an
immunomodulatory compound rather than an immunosup-
pressive compound [50, 53]. T2D is a chronic metabolic disease with serious com-
plications resulting from defects in either insulin secretion,
insulin action, or both [124]. A study by Ubillas et al. showed that the aqueous ethanol extract of the aerial part
of B. pilosa at 1 g/kg body weight (BW) lowered blood
glucose in db/db mice, a T2D mouse model [51]. Based
on a bioactivity-guided identification, compounds 69 and
50 were identified. Further, the mixture of the compounds
(69 : 50) in a 2 : 3 ratio significantly decreased blood glucose
concentration and reduced food intake on the second day
of treatment when administered at doses of 250mg/kg twice
a day to C5BL/Ks-db/db mice. When tested at 500mg/kg,
a more substantial drop in blood glucose level as well
as the stronger anorexic effect (food intake reduced from
5.8 g/mouse/day to 2.5 g/mouse/day) was observed [51]. In
this study, it was suggested that the blood glucose lower-
ing effect of B. pilosa was caused, in part, by the hunger
suppressing effect of its polyynes [51]. However, the hunger
suppressing effect of the ethanol extract of B. pilosa was
not found in the studies described below. In another study
[24], water extracts of B. pilosa (BPWE) were used in
diabetic db/db mice, aged 6–8 weeks, with postprandial
blood glucose levels of 350 to 400mg/dL. Like oral anti-
diabetic glimepiride, which stimulates insulin release, one
single dose of BPWE reduced blood glucose levels from
374 to 144mg/dL. The antihyperglycemic effect of BPWE
was inversely correlated to an increase in serum insulin
levels, suggesting that BPWE acts to lower blood glucose via
increased insulin production. However, BPWE had different
insulin secretion kinetics to glimepiride [24]. One flaw in
current anti-diabetics is their decreasing efficacy over time. The authors investigated the long term anti-diabetic effect
of BPWE in db/db mice. BPWE reduced blood glucose,
increased blood insulin, improved glucose tolerance, and
reduced the percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Both long-term and one-time experiments strongly support
the anti-diabetic action of BPWE [24]. In sharp contrast to
glimepiride, BPWE protected against islet atrophy in mouse
pancreas. The investigators further evaluated anti-diabetic
properties of 3 B. pilosa varieties, B. pilosa L. var. radiate
(BPR), B.pilosa L. var. pilosa (BPP), and B. pilosa L. var.minor
(BPM) in db/db mice [8]. One single oral dose (10, 50 and
250mg/kg body weight) of BPR, BPP, or BPM crude extracts
decreased postprandial blood glucose levels in db/db mice
for up to four hours, and the reduction of glucose levels in
the blood appeared to be dose-dependent. Comparing the
three variants, BPR extract resulted in a higher reduction in
blood glucose levels when administered at the same dose as

the other two varieties. In terms of serum insulin levels, a dose
of 50mg/kg of each extract was used, and the BPR extract,
together with the three polyynes, significantly increased the
serum insulin level in db/db mice. Long-term experiments
(28-day treatment) were then conducted using diabetic mice
with postprandial glucose levels from 370 to 420mg/dL, and
glimepiride was used as positive control.The range of dosages
applied was from 10mg/kg BW to 250mg/kg BW. Results
showed that the positive control as well as the crude extracts
of the three varieties lowered the blood glucose levels in
db/db mice. However, only BPR extract, containing a higher
percentage of cytopiloyne (53), reduced blood glucose levels
and augmented blood insulin levelsmore than BPP andBPM. The percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was
also measured and found to be 7.9% ± 0.5% in mice aged 10–
12 weeks, and 6.6% ± 0.2%, 6.1% ± 0.3% and 6.2% ± 0.3% in
the blood of age-matchedmice following treatment with BPR
crude extract (50mg/kg), glimepiride (1mg/kg), and com-
pound 53 (0.5mg/kg), respectively [8]. Among the polyynes
found in B. pilosa, cytopiloyne was the most effective against
T2D. Hence, cytopiloyne was used for further study on anti-
diabetic action and mechanism [125]. The data confirmed
that cytopiloyne reduced postprandial blood glucose lev-
els, increased blood insulin, improved glucose tolerance,
suppressed HbA1c level, and protected pancreatic islets in
db/db mice. Nevertheless, cytopiloyne failed to decrease
blood glucose in streptoztocin (STZ)-treated mice whose b
cells were already destroyed. Additionally, cytopiloyne dose-
dependently increased insulin secretion and expression in b
cells as well as calcium influx, diacylglycerol, and activation
of protein kinase C𝛼. Collectively, the mechanistic studies
suggest that cytopiloyne treats T2D via regulation of insulin
production involving the calcium/DAG/PKC𝛼 cascade in b
cells. The studies detailed above point to the conclusion that
cytopiloyne and related polyynes (compounds 69 and 49)
are anti-diabetics in animal models. The data uncover a new
biological action of polyynes. It should be noted that, like
all anti-diabetic drugs, cytopiloyne failed to prevent or cure
diabetes completely but reduced diabetic complications [125]. Intriguingly, 34 polyynes have been found in B. pilosa so far. It remains to be seen whether all the polyynes present in this
plant have anti-diabetic activities. 3.4. Antioxidant Activity. Free radicals can damage cellular
components via a series of chemical reactions [89] leading
to development and progression of cardiovascular disease,
cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and ageing [70]. Free
radicals, nitric oxide (NO), and superoxide anions can be
produced in macrophages to kill microbes. However, an
excessive generation of the free radicals under pathological
conditions is associated with a wide range of illnesses. Plants are known to be rich in antioxidant phytochemicals. Chiang and colleagues evaluated the free radical scaveng-
ing activity of crude extract, fractions, and compounds of
B. pilosa using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and
hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase assays [70]. Using DPPH
and hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase assays, they found that
the B. pilosa crude extract and the ethyl acetate, butanol,
and water fractions had free radical scavenging activity. Nine compounds, Heptyl- 2-O-𝛽-xylofuranosyl-(1→ 6)-𝛽-
glucopyranoside (199), 3-O-Rabinobioside (124), Quercetin
3-O-rutinoside (130), Chlorogenic acid (167), 3,4-Di-O-
caffeoylquinic acid (169), 3,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (170),
4,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (171), Jacein (119), and Cen-
taurein (110) had DPPH radical scavenging activity [70]. The IC
50
values of the B. pilosa crude extract/fractions and
compounds are summarized in Tables 14 and 15, respectively. Measurement of free radical scavenging activities is one
way of assessing the antioxidant activities of B. pilosa and
its fractions and compounds. It is interesting that the ethyl
acetate and butanol fractions are more active than the water
fraction and B. pilosa crude extract [70]. Of the secondary
metabolites, only phenolic compounds 124, 130, 167, 169, and
171 showed significant DPPH-radical scavenging activities. Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 43
Further analysis of the structure-activity relationship of the
compounds suggested that substitution of the C3 hydroxyl
group with glycosides increased the activity approximately
2-fold (for example, in compounds 124 and 130) relative to
quercetin (-OH in its C3) [70]. Further modification of the
structures of the active compounds needs to be performed to
test the effects of various substituents on activity. The reason
why most of the antioxidant compounds contain phenol
moieties in their structure could be that the reduction-
oxidation (redox) properties of phenols allow them to act
as reducing agents, singlet oxygen quenchers, and hydrogen
donors. A complementary study by Muchuweti and colleagues
determined phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and the
phenolic profile of B. pilosa methanol extract [89]. They
estimated that the phenolic content of the methanol extract
of B. pilosawas 1102.8±2.2mg/g [89]. Vanillin, hydroxyben-
zaldehyde, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, and ferulic acid were
found in this extract.The B. pilosa extract also showed DPPH
radical scavenging activity. Furthermore, the antioxidant
activity of the flavonoids found in B. pilosa was correlated
with its hepatoprotective effects through their inhibition
of NF-𝜅B activation which may lessen the oxidative stress
caused by the production of free radicals during liver injury
[60].This activity might also be due to the anti-inflammatory
effects of the aqueous extracts of B. pilosa aerial parts on the
inhibition of COX-2 and PGE
2
production [88]. Essential oils from B. pilosa flowers and leaves are also
reported to possess antioxidant activity. With the aim of
replacing chemically synthesized additives, Deba and col-
leagues [92] worked on the antioxidant, antibacterial, and
antifungal activities of essential oils and water extracts of B.
pilosa’s leaves and flowers. Table 16 summarizes the results
obtained from DPPH free radical scavenging assay. It can be inferred fromTable 16 that essential oils from the
leaves possessed the highest activity. It is reported elsewhere
that monoterpenes present in essential oils such that of B.
pilosa have protective effects and antioxidant properties [92]. Beta-carotene bleaching method was also performed. Leaves
essential oils and aqueous extracts of the leaves and flowers
showed higher activity than the flower essential oils. This is
due to the volatility of the flower essential oils. The activity
exhibited by the aqueous extracts was accounted to the
presence of phenolic compounds that are reported to donate
a hydrogen atom to free radicals such that the propagation of
the chain reaction during lipid oxidation is terminated [92]. Overall, essential oils and phenolics present in B. pilosa can
be thought of as major antioxidant compounds. 3.5. Immunomodulatory Activity. B. pilosa is thought to be
an immunomodulatory plant and is reported to be effective
in the treatment of immune disorders such as allergy [75],
arthritis [75], and T1D [48, 50, 53]. As pointed out in the discussion of its anti-diabetic
activities (Section 3.3), a combination of phytochemicals
method and T-cell activation assays was used to study
immunomodulatory properties of B. pilosa. IFN-𝛾 is a key
cytokine released by T and NK cells that mediates immune
cells and sustains immunity against pathogens. Defects in
IFN-𝛾 expression, regulation, and activation result in vulner-
ability to diseases caused by bacteria and viruses [69]. An
elegant study, performed byChang and colleagues using IFN-
𝛾 promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct in Jurkat
T cells, showed that hot water crude extracts of B. pilosa
increased IFN-𝛾 promoter activity two-fold [69]. Out of the
subfractions of this extract, the butanol fraction, but not the
water or ethyl acetate, fractions, increased IFN-𝛾 promoter
activity six-fold. Centaurein (110) and centaureidin (109)
were identified from the butanol fraction and were stated to
cause a four-fold increase in IFN-𝛾 promoter activity with
EC
50
values of 75 𝜇g/mL and 0.9𝜇g/mL, respectively. The
mechanism of action of centaurein was determined using
transcription factors such as AP-1, NFAT, and NF𝜅B which
are reported to bind to IFN-𝛾 promoter and regulate IFN-𝛾
transcription. Unlike with the activity of the positive control,
PHA, centaurein caused a four-fold increase in NFAT, a
3-fold increase in NF𝜅B and had little, if any, effect on
AP-1 enhancer activities (23-fold, three-fold, and ten-fold
increases, respectively, were seenwith PHA) [69].The authors
concluded that centaureinmodulates IFN-𝛾 expression by the
NFAT and NF𝜅B pathways. The article only determined the
mechanism of action of centaurein. Its aglycone centaureidin
may act through the samemechanism though this conclusion
needs to be further verified. B. pilosa extract and its compounds are reported to inhibit
differentiation of na¨ıve CD4+ helper T (Th0) cells into Th1
cells [49].
