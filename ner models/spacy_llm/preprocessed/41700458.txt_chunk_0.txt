are known to reduce the risk of cancer development; whether such effects are through regulating the extent of nucleic acid
oxidation remains unclear. Here, we outlined the role of reactive oxygen species in nucleic acid oxidation as a driving force in
cancer progression. The consequential relationship between genome instability and cancer progression highlights the importance
of modulation of cellular redox level in cancer management. Current epidemiological and experimental evidence demonstrate
the effects and modes of action of phytoagents in nucleic acid oxidation and provide rationales for the use of phytoagents as
chemopreventive or therapeutic agents. Vitamins and various phytoagents antagonize carcinogen-triggered oxidative stress by
scavenging free radicals and/or activating endogenous defence systems such as Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes or pathways. Moreover, metal ion chelation by phytoagents helps to attenuate oxidative DNA damage caused by transition metal ions. Besides,
the prooxidant effects of some phytoagents pose selective cytotoxicity on cancer cells and shed light on a new strategy of cancer
therapy. The ‚Äúdouble-edged sword‚Äù role of phytoagents as redox regulators in nucleic acid oxidation and their possible roles in
cancer prevention or therapy are discussed in this review. 1. Nucleic Acid Oxidation as a Marker of
Oxidative Insult by Reactive Oxygen Species
and the Driving Force in Cancer Progression
The integrity of the genome is of crucial importance for
proper gene expression andDNA replication. Loss of genome
integrity jeopardizes normal cellular physiological activities
and leads to cellular pathological events such as senescence,
apoptosis, and tumorigenesis [1]. Under oxidative stress,
the level of genotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) is
abnormally elevated. ROS interact with and modify the
chemical properties of biomolecules inside the cell, which
causes oxidative insults such as oxidation of nucleic acids,
peroxidation of lipids [2], and denaturation of proteins [3]. Oxidative modification to DNA structure mainly occurs in
the form of base oxidation. Guanine, which possesses the
lowest oxidation potential of the DNA bases, is the most
frequent target of ROS. ROS-elicited changes in biomolecules
can be used as biomarkers to indicate the presence and
extent of oxidative insult. 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-
oxoG), the oxidation product of the DNA base guanine
is a well-characterized marker for oxidative stress-induced
DNA damage [4]. Following the oxidation of a DNA base,
genome integrity is at increased risk because the DNA repair
process, base excision repair (BER), can increase the level
of interrupted DNA strands resulting in indirect single-
strand break (SSB) [5], subsequently leading to introduction
of mismatched base pairing during translesion DNA repair
[6]. As a consequence, genome instability and accumulation
of mutations lead to genetic heterogeneity in cancer cells
that drive the adaptive evolution of cancer colonies with
survival/expansion advantages [7]. Figure 1 shows the genetic

drives cancer progression. instability and heterogeneity caused by nucleic acid oxidation
in cancer cells which lead to carcinogenesis and cancer evolu-
tion. During BER, indirect SSB are produced as intermediates
after the removal of oxidized bases and their corresponding
nucleotides. If SSB takes place at adjacent regions on both
strands of the same chromosome, genome instability can
ensue. Meanwhile, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
is activated after binding to SSB and consumes NAD+ to
synthesize polyA chains which then recruit important DNA
repair enzymes, such as DNA polymerase ùõΩ and DNA
ligase III. PARP also induces apoptosis through increased
poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) levels that facilitate the release of
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) frommitochondria and elicit
apoptosis. Otherwise, depletion of NAD due to excessive
PARP activity will further deplete the ATP pool and lead to
cell lysis (necrosis). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
promotes the switch to a specialized DNA polymerase with a
larger active site that tolerates damaged bases at the expense
of sacrificing fidelity during translesion synthesis/repair. Lower fidelity increases the chance of mismatch which gives
rise to point mutations. The accumulation of genome insta-
bility and point mutations results in genome heterogeneity
among cells and, chronologically, within cells. Tumor initi-
ation is triggered by mutations that can activate oncogenes
or silence tumor suppressor genes. Further mutations that
give rise to gain/loss of function of genes then grant tumor
cells the ability to resist growth control. Further gain/loss
of function continues to drive cancer progression enabling
tumor cells to escape layers of control and become capable
of invasion and metastasis. Elevated levels of oxidative DNA lesions (8-oxoG) have
been noted in various tumors, supporting the argument that
such damage contributes to the etiology of cancer. Therefore,
8-oxoG has been established as an important biomarker
which is widely used to measure oxidative stress and assess
risk of tumor initiation after exposure to various carcinogenic
substances and pollutants [8]. In a cohort study involving
esophageal cancer patients, more extensive oxidative damage
to DNA as indicated by 8-oxoG levels was detected in cancer
patients, in comparison to a healthy control group. Smoking
habits and alcohol consumption, risk factors for esophageal
cancer, were also correlated with the observed levels of
oxidative DNA damage [9]. Oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation is also asso-
ciated with the early stages of carcinogenesis [10]. Mal-
ondialdehyde (MDA), the product of lipid peroxidation,
can induce the formation of DNA adducts which leads to
mutagenesis. In an epidemiological study of breast cancer, the
level of the malondialdehyde-DNA adduct, 3-(2-deoxy-ùõΩ-D-
erythro-pentofuranosyl) pyrimido [1,2-ùõº]purin-10(3H) one
(M1dG), was significantly higher in breast tissue specimens
from cancer patients than in those from healthy individuals
[11].Therefore, other than 8-oxoG, the level ofM1dGhas been
employed as an indicator of cancer-associated oxidative DNA

Figure 2: Markers of oxidative DNA damage are elevated in cancer patients. ROS causes oxidative damage to biomolecules such as DNA,
lipids, and proteins, and the resulting end products are often detrimental to normal cell physiological functions. As the result of DNA base
oxidation, 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG) can serve as a biomarker of primary oxidative DNA damage.When lipids are attacked by ROS, secondary
DNA damage arises due to malondialdehyde (MDA), the end production of lipid peroxidation that can covalently bind to guanine and form
MDA-DNA adduct (M1dG). In human cancer patients, both 8-oxoG and M1dG are found to be elevated, suggesting a correlation between
higher oxidative stress and cancer. damage. These markers are used as measures of antioxidant
activity in studies that assess the chemopreventive efficacy
of anticancer agents including phytochemicals [9, 12, 13]
(Figure 2). 2. Sources of ROS and Cellular
Antioxidant Defense
ROS are genotoxic and ubiquitous. They include the super-
oxide anion radical (O
2
‚àô‚àí), hydrogen peroxide (H
2
O
2
), the
hydroxyl radical (OH‚àô), and the nitric oxide radical (NO‚àô)
[14]. For maintenance of genome integrity and normal cell
physiological function, cells have developed strategies to
control ROS levels. Such control is known as antioxidant
defense [14]. Cellular redox status, the level of ROS, is the net
result of ROS arising from various origins and the capacity
of the cell to remove it by antioxidant defense. Many pre-
ventive/therapeutic regimens, including those phytoagent-
based, intervene in disease progression by fine-tuning the
level of ROS and the corresponding antioxidant responses in
the cell [15], and thus shifting the redox balance in favor of
human health. Introductions of the various origins of ROS
and cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms are outlined
below. 2.1. Origins of ROS. Sources of ROS can be divided into three
major categories: exogenous, endogenous, metal-catalyzed
(Figure 3(a)). Exogenously, ROS levels are mainly increased
by environmental and dietary factors. These factors may
serve as prooxidants that elicit ROS directly through chem-
ical reactions or through the inhibition of cellular anti-
oxidant defense or as substrates or stimulators of ROS-
producing enzymes. Environmental factors that increaseROS
production include ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, air
pollutants, cigarette smoke, pesticides, and industrial solvents
or chemicals. Dietary factors that induce ROS include food
containing peroxidized lipids (from rotten oil), polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH, from high-temperature pro-
cessed hydrocarbon-based food), and food additives (preser-
vatives). 4 Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity

Figure 3: The source and clearance of ROS. (a) Three major origins of ROS. The sources of ROS can be roughly classified into three
major categories: exogenous, endogenous, and transition metal ion-catalyzed. Exogenous sources of ROS can elicit radical chain reactions,
contain/produce ROS, or stimulate enzymatic ROS production. Endogenous sources of ROS include the various enzymes that produce
ROS as by-products or as signaling mediators or as antimicrobial agents during inflammation. Many of these enzymes can be activated
by stimulation by cytokines and growth factors, such as NOX, LOX, XO, and MPO. Some CYPs are inducible and can be upregulated by
environmental pollutants, dietary phytocompounds, or drugs. The transition metal ion-catalyzed Fenton-reaction produces highly reactive
hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide. (b) Layers of antioxidant defense. There are several layers of antioxidant defense. Basal level
antioxidant defenses provide buffering capacity upon ROS challenge. Radical scavengers can directly quench ROS, and metal-chelating
proteins can block ROS generation catalyzed by the Fenton or Fenton-like reactions. Further antioxidant capacity is provided by inducible
antioxidant enzymes that aremostly under the regulation of Nrf2/ARE signaling (see Figure 4). ROS can oxidize the thiol group of amino acid
residues leading to intermolecular or intramolecular disulfide bond formation. These disulfide bonds that are caused by oxidation can lead
to structural/functional alteration of proteins. These disulfide bonds can be reduced by the glutathione system and the thioredoxin system
allowing resumption of protein function. NADPH plays an indispensable role in the recycling of glutathione and thioredoxin, and therefore
metabolic enzymes that are involved in NADPH generation also account for antioxidant defense.
