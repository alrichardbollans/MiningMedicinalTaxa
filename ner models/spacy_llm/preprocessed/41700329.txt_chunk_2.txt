S.N. denotes serial number. the chloroform fraction was the most toxic with a half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
50
) of 97 ± 7.2 and 83 ±
5.2 𝜇g/mL in NRU and MTT, respectively [82]. Kumari and
colleagues also reported the anti-cancer and anti-malarial
activities of B. pilosa leaves [77]. Based on a cytotoxicity-
directed fractionation strategy, they identified phenyl-1,3,5-
heptatriene with IC
50
values of 8±0.01, 0.49±0.45, 0.7±0.01,
and 10 ± 0.01 𝜇g/mL against human oral, liver, colon, and
breast cancer cell lines, respectively. However, phenyl-1,3,5-
heptatriyne showed lower activity against breast cancer cell
lines than the chloroform leaf extract which had an IC
50
value of 6.5 ± 0.01 𝜇g/mL. Moreover, the positive control,
taxol, showed higher activity than phenyl-1,3,5-heptatriyne
[77]. Furthermore, in vitro comet assays were performed to
evaluate the toxicity of n-hexane, chloroform, and methanol
extracts of B. pilosa and its ethyl acetate, acetone, and water
fractions onHela andKB cells.The ethyl acetate fraction from
the methanol extract exhibited the highest activity with half
maximal cytotoxic concentrations (CTC
50
) of 965.2𝜇g/mL
and 586.2𝜇g/mL against Hela and KB cells, respectively. Despite the moderate toxicity, these findings suggest that
these B. pilosa extracts/fractions could be useful for future
