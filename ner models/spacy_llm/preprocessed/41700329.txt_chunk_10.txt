In addition, one intravenous dose of
the extract at 10, 20, and 30mg/kg BW decreased systolic
blood pressure in normal rats by 18.3%, 42.5%, and 30%,
46 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine
respectively, and the same doses reduced the blood pressure
in hypertensive rats by 25.8%, 38.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. Only the highest dose (30mg/kg) affected the force of the
contraction of the heart. Atropine and propranolol were used
to interfere with the hypotensive action of the NBP. Atropine
reduced the initial phase of the hypotensive response in NBP
and completely abolished the second phase of hypotensive
response in NBP. In contrast, propranolol increased the
first hypotensive response but partially abolished the second
hypotensive response provoked by the NBP [110].This mech-
anistic study suggested that B. pilosa invokes the biphasic
hypotensive responses via targeting cardiac pump efficiency
during the first phase and vasodilation at the second phase
[110]. A further study was performed to investigate the relaxing
effect of a neutral extract of B. pilosa (NBP) on rat aorta con-
tractedwithKCl (60mM) andnorepinephrine (0.1mM) [94]. Cumulative addition of NBP relaxed the rat aorta previously
contracted by KCl in a dose-dependent manner. The EC
50
value of theNBP for vasorelaxationwas 0.32mg/mL.Thedata
also showed that the NBP reduced the contraction of aorta
previously contracted by KCl irrespective of the presence of
aortic endothelium [94]. Pretreatment with glibenclamide, an ATP-dependent K+
channel blocker, did not considerably affect the relaxant effect
of the NBP on KCl-induced contraction, suggesting that
the vasodilatory effect of B. pilosa was not related to the
opening of this ATP-dependent K+ channel [94]. On the
other hand, in the presence of indomethacin or pyrilamine
maleate, the relaxant response induced by the plant extract
was significantly inhibited at the lower concentrations. The
plant extract was able to reduce the aorta resting tone, inhibit
the KCl-induced contractions by 90% at 1.5mg/mL and the
CaCl
2
-induced contractions by 95% at 0.75mg/mL. These
results demonstrate that B. pilosa can act as a vasodilator
probably via acting as a calcium antagonist [94]. However, no specific compound for the above activity
has been identified from B. pilosa to date. A bioactivity-
guided identification approach may be adopted to identify
the active compounds in B. pilosa that possess hypotensive
and vasodilatory effects and understand their mechanism of
action. 3.10. Wound Healing Activity. B. pilosa has been traditionally
used to treat tissue injury inCameroon, Brazil, andVenezuela
[26]. Hassan and colleagues investigated the wound healing
potential of B. pilosa in Wistar rats [128]. Mirroring the
positive control neomycin sulfate, the ethanol extract of B.
pilosa had faster wound closure than control rats 3, 6, and 9
days after topical application. Histological examination also
revealed better collagenation, angiogenesis, and organization
of wound tissue seven days after application. Epithelialization
and total healing time in B. pilosa-treated rats were compara-
ble to those of neomycin sulfate. Together, these data suggest
that B. pilosa may be a viable alternative to neomycin lotion
for the treatment of wounds. In addition to studying the wound healing effect of B.
pilosa on external ulcers, Tan and colleagues also examined
the effect of methanol, cyclohexane, and methyl chloride
extracts of B. pilosa on gastric ulcers in Wistar rats fed
with 1mL HCl/ethanol gastric necrotizing solution (150mM
HCl in 60% ethanol), and macroscopically visible lesions
were scored [26]. Among the three extracts, methylene chlo-
ride extracts exhibited the highest activity showing 46.4%
inhibition of lesion formation at a dose of 500mg/kg BW
and complete inhibition at 750mg/kg [26]. The efficacy of
the ethylene chloride extract was followed by that of the
methanol extracts which had inhibition ranging from 30.4%
to 82.2% at concentrations of 500mg/kg and 1000mg/kg
BW, respectively [26]. The cyclohexane extracts showed the
lowest activity against gastric ulcers in rats with 13.3%,
40%, and 79.7% inhibition at 500, 750, and 1000mg/kg BW,
respectively [26]. To better understand the mode of action
of the methylene chloride extract of B. pilosa, rats were
pretreated with indomethacin, a COX-2 inhibitor involved in
prostaglandin synthesis. Pretreatment significantly reduced
the protection against HCl/ethanol-induced ulcers to 31.3%
inhibition at 750mg/kg BW, suggesting a link between the
antiulcerative activity of B. pilosa and prostaglandin syn-
thesis. Unexpectedly, the methylene chloride extract of B.
pilosa showed little gastric mucosal protection against gastric
lesions induced by 95% ethanol (1mL) [26]. Absolute alcohol
is known to cause mucosal/submucosal tissue destruction via
cellular necrosis and the release of tissue-derived mediators
(histamine and leukotrieneC4).Thus, these data imply thatB. pilosa did not prevent the generation or the necrotic action of
these mediators on the gastric microvasculature. In addition,
pylorus ligation can increase gastric acid secretion without
an alteration of mucosal histamine content. The methylene
chloride extract of B. pilosa did not possess antisecretory
activity. On the contrary, it was observed that increases in the
dose of the extract led to elevated gastric juice acidity [26]. Results with both absolute ethanol and pylorus ligation rat
models suggested the possibility that the ineffectiveness of B.
pilosa against gastric ulcers was due to lack of antihistaminic
activity in the plant. In summary, overall the data suggest that
B. pilosa protects against HCL/ethanol-mediated ulcers via
inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis. Previous phytochemical studies showed that a group
of flavonoids, acyclichalcones, are present in B. pilosa
[129, 130] and the chalcones were proposed to have anti-
ulcerative activity [131]. Moreover, nine hydroxychalcones 10
were reported to possess gastric cytoprotective effects with
2,4-dihydroxychalcone being the most active [132]. Since
methylene chloride extracts appear to be the most active B.
pilosa extracts, next, the specific anti-ulcerative phytochemi-
cals in the methylene chloride extracts of B. pilosa and their
modes of action needs to be probed. Despite the claims listed inTable 3, relatively few scientific
studies have been conducted in vitro and in vivo to address the
traditional ethnomedical uses of B. pilosa. Information about
the use of B. pilosa as a botanical therapy recorded so far is
far from complete. Studies conducted thus far only serve as
a starting point for further investigation of B. pilosa, and the
ultimate efficacious use of the herb in clinical applications. Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 47
4. Toxicology
Despite its use as an ingredient in food for human con-
sumption, studies on systemic toxicity (e.g., acute, subacute,
chronic and subchronic toxicities) of B. pilosa in humans
and animals are still inadequate and insufficient. So far,
acute, and/or subchronic toxicities have been evaluated in
rats and mice. Oral acute and 28-day toxicities of water
extract of B. pilosa leaves were evaluated in Wistar rats
[133]. An oral dose of water extract of B. pilosa leaves at
10 g/kg BW showed no obvious mortality or changes in
the appearance in rats [134]. The same extract at 0.8 g/kg
BW/day, once a day, showed no obvious sub-chronic toxicity
in rats over 28 days, as measured by survival rate, body
weight, and gross examination of organs [134]. These data
are consistent with our data indicating that oral delivery
of the water extract of the B. pilosa whole plant at 1 g/kg
BW/day, once a day, is safe in rats over 28 days (unpublished
data). Taken together, these studies suggest that ingestion of
B. pilosa aqueous extract at up to at 1 g/kg BW/day, once
a day, is highly safe in rats. In addition, the acute toxicity
of aqueous and ethanol extracts of B. pilosa in mice have
been reported [134]. Five- to six-week-old mice with weights
between 28 and 35 g received a peritoneal injection of both
extracts at the different doses. The LD
50
, the dose that causes
50% lethality, of the aqueous and ethanol extracts in mice
was 12.30 g/kg BW and 6.15 g/kg BW, respectively [134]. A
complete toxicological study has not been completed for
humans. Furthermore, the drug interactions of B. pilosa with
other drugs are unknown. Further safety verification and
clinical trials should be performed before B. pilosa can be
considered for medicinal use. 5. Conclusions
B. pilosa is an erect, perennial plant with green leaves, white
or yellow flowers and tiny black seeds. As it is distributed
worldwide and is widely used as a folk remedy, B. pilosa
can be thought of as an extraordinary source of food and
medicine. However, a comprehensive up-to-date review of
research on B. pilosa has hitherto been unavailable. In this
article, scientific studies on B. pilosa have been summarized
and critically discussed from the perspectives of botany,
ethnomedicine, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicol-
ogy. B. pilosa is claimed to treat more than 40 disorders,
and 201 compounds have been identified from this plant. The medicinal utility of B. pilosa and its modes of action
in relation to its known phytochemicals were discussed
herein. Polyynes, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, fatty acids,
and phenolics are the primary bioactive compounds of B.
pilosa, and they have been reported to be effective in the
treatment of tumors, inflammation/immune modulation,
diabetes, viruses, microbes, protozoans, gastrointestinal dis-
eases, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Caution
should be exercised in the therapeutic use of B. pilosa for
hypoglycemia, hypotension, bleeding, and allergy.
