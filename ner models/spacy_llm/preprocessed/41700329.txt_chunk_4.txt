studies [83]. Hot water extracts of B. pilosa var.minor Sheriff
were also assessed for its antileukemic effects on leukemic
cell lines L1210, U937, K562, Raji, and P3HR1 using XTT-
based colorimetric assays. The extract inhibited the five cell
lines with IC
50
values ranging from 145𝜇g/mL to 586𝜇g/mL. L1210, K562, Raji, and P3HR1 were more sensitive to B. pilosa
extract with IC
50
values below 200𝜇g/mL [98]. Consistent with the antitumor activities of B. pilosa
extracts and fractions, some of its phytochemicals also
showed anticancer activity as outlined in Table 11. Among
them, luteolin (103), a well-studied flavonoid with multiple
bioactivities, was more effective against tumor cell prolifera-
tion than its derivatives with IC
50
values ranging from 3 𝜇M
to 50𝜇M in cells, and 5 to 10mg/kg in animals. Luteolin was
also found to fight cancer as a food additive at concentrations
of 50 to 200 ppm [78] and prevent skin cancer [78] and cancer3
invasion [103]. Lee and colleagues reported that luteolin
prevents cancer by inhibiting cell adhesion and invasion
[103]. Significant inhibition concentration was reported to be
5 𝜇M and complete inhibition concentration was reported to
be 40𝜇M. Moreover, luteolin was reported to inhibit hepa-
tocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced cell scattering as well
as cytoskeleton changes such as filopodia and lamellipodia
whichwas determined using phase-contrast and fluorescence
microscopy. Furthermore, luteolin also inhibited the HGF-
induced phosphorylation of c-Met, ERK 1/2, and Akt as
well as the MAPK/ERK and P13K-Akt pathways [78, 103]. Other mechanisms underlying the anticancer activities of
luteolin are the inhibition of topoisomerase I and II, which
inhibits cell replication and DNA repair thus promoting
apoptosis, regulation of PI-3-Kinase/Akt/MAPK/ERK/JNK,
activation of apoptosis in the mitochondrial pathway by
activating caspase 9 and caspase 3, which were found in
malignant cells but not in normal human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, death receptor-induced apoptosis, and a
cell-cycle arrest mechanism, inhibition of fatty acid synthase
which is upregulated in many cancer cells, and sensitization
to chemotherapywhereby luteolin increases the susceptibility
of cancer cells to chemotherapy [78]. Butein (82) is another
flavonoid that showed a cytotoxic effect on human colon
adenocarcinoma cell proliferation with a reported IC
50
value
of 1.75 𝜇M. Butein at 2 𝜇M affected the incorporation of
[14C]-labeled leucine, thymidine, and uridine which can
cause the inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis of
human colon cancer cells. Moreover, butein also exhibited
noncompetitive inhibition of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene
(CDNB) in glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. Tumor
resistance was correlated with high levels of GST, thus, butein
inhibited proliferation of cancer cells [80]. Another flavonoid
present in B. pilosa, centaureidin (109), also showed anti-
cancer activity in B lymphoma cells. Centaureidin, isolated
from Polymnia fruticosa, inhibited tubulin polymerization in
vitro and induced mitotic figure formation in CA46 Burkitt
lymphoma cells. Using turbidimetric assay, the IC
50
value of
centaureidin in inhibition of mitosis was 3𝜇M [104]. Cyto-
toxicity of centaureidin was further analyzed using American
National Cancer Institute (NCI) 60 human tumor cell lines. The cytotoxicity potency of centaureidin, expressed as GI
50
(50% growth inhibition in the NCI tumor line panel), was
0.24𝜇M [81]. These data mark centaureidin as a promising
antimitotic agent for tumor therapy. In addition to anti-tumor flavones, polyynes found in B. 4
pilosa have also been shown to possess anti-tumor proper-
ties. Based on a bioactivity-directed isolation approach, Wu
and colleagues identified two polyyne aglycones from the
ethyl acetate fraction of B. pilosa [44]. 1,2-Dihydroxytrideca-
5,7,9,11-tetrayne (48) and 1,3-Dihydroxy-6(E)- tetradecene-
8,10,12-triyne (46) exhibited significant anticell prolifera-
tion activity in primary human umbilical vein endothelium
cells (HUVEC) with IC
50
values of 12.5 𝜇M and 1.73 𝜇M,
respectively. They also decreased angiogenesis and pro-
moted apoptosis in human endothelial cells. Their anti-
angiogenic and cytotoxic effects correlated with activation
of the CDK inhibitors and caspase-7 [44]. In addition, 1,2-
Dihyroxy-5(E)-tridecene-7,9,11-triyne (45) showed antian-
giogenic effects in HUVECs with an IC
50
value of 12.4 𝜇M as
evidenced by a decrease in the tube formation and migration
of HUVECs [43]. The IC
50
value of compound 45 in the
inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor-induced HUVEC
growth was 28.2𝜇M. However, it had higher IC
50
values
than those for lung carcinoma cells and keratinocytes. This
compound could also inhibit cell proliferation of HUVECs,
lung carcinoma A549 cells and HACAT keratinocytes. The
mechanism by which compound 45 inhibits HUVEC growth
and angiogenesis is complicated and includes decreasing the
expression of cell cycle regulators (CDK4, cyclins D1 and A,
retinoblastoma (Rb), and vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor 1), caspase-mediated activation of CDK inhibitors
p21 (Cip1) and p27 (Kip), upregulation of Fas ligand expres-
sion, downregulation of Bcl-2 expression, and activation of
caspase-7 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase [43]. 3.2. Anti-Inflammatory Activity. B. pilosa is commonly used
to treat inflammatory disorders. The anti-inflammatory phy-
tochemicals present in B. pilosa are listed in Table 11. 5
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a physiologically important
enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandin
(PGE
2
). Its expression is induced by a wide variety of external
stimuli indicating its involvement in inflammatory diseases,
and it is used as an inflammatory marker [88]. Yoshida and
colleagues studied the effects of the aqueous extracts of B.
pilosa aerial parts in the production of COX-2 and PGE
2
as
well as on the activation of mitogen activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) in normal human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) in
response to inflammatory cytokine, IL-1𝛽. This work showed
that IL-1𝛽 activated MAPKs such as ERK1/2, p38, and JNK
to different extents and induced COX-2 expression. The
COX-2 expression in HDFs was regulated mainly by p38
following IL-1𝛽 stimulation. Consistently, the p38 inhibitor
SB203580 blocked this expression. Using this cell platform,
B. pilosa extracts were tested for inhibition of inflammation. The extract dose-dependently suppressed the activation of
p38 and JNK and moderately suppressed ERK1/2, as well
as suppressing COX-2 expression and PGE
2
production
