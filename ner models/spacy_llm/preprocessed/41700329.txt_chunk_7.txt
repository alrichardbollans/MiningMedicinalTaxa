In terms of serum insulin levels, a dose of 50mg/kg of each extract was used, and the BPR extract, together with the three polyynes, significantly increased the serum insulin level in db/db mice. Long-term experiments (28-day treatment) were then conducted using diabetic mice with postprandial glucose levels from 370 to 420mg/dL, and glimepiride was used as positive control.The range of dosages applied was from 10mg/kg BW to 250mg/kg BW. Results showed that the positive control as well as the crude extracts of the three varieties lowered the blood glucose levels in db/db mice. However, only BPR extract, containing a higher percentage of cytopiloyne (53), reduced blood glucose levels and augmented blood insulin levelsmore than BPP andBPM. The percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was also measured and found to be 7.9% +- 0.5% in mice aged 10- 12 weeks, and 6.6% +- 0.2%, 6.1% +- 0.3% and 6.2% +- 0.3% in the blood of age-matchedmice following treatment with BPR crude extract (50mg/kg), glimepiride (1mg/kg), and com- pound 53 (0.5mg/kg), respectively [8]. Among the polyynes found in B. pilosa, cytopiloyne was the most effective against T2D. Hence, cytopiloyne was used for further study on anti- diabetic action and mechanism [125]. The data confirmed that cytopiloyne reduced postprandial blood glucose lev- els, increased blood insulin, improved glucose tolerance, suppressed HbA1c level, and protected pancreatic islets in db/db mice. Nevertheless, cytopiloyne failed to decrease blood glucose in streptoztocin (STZ)-treated mice whose b cells were already destroyed. Additionally, cytopiloyne dose- dependently increased insulin secretion and expression in b cells as well as calcium influx, diacylglycerol, and activation of protein kinase C. Collectively, the mechanistic studies suggest that cytopiloyne treats T2D via regulation of insulin production involving the calcium/DAG/PKC cascade in b cells. The studies detailed above point to the conclusion that cytopiloyne and related polyynes (compounds 69 and 49) are anti-diabetics in animal models. The data uncover a new biological action of polyynes. It should be noted that, like all anti-diabetic drugs, cytopiloyne failed to prevent or cure diabetes completely but reduced diabetic complications [125]. Intriguingly, 34 polyynes have been found in B. pilosa so far. It remains to be seen whether all the polyynes present in this plant have anti-diabetic activities. 3.4. Antioxidant Activity. Free radicals can damage cellular components via a series of chemical reactions [89] leading to development and progression of cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and ageing [70]. Free radicals, nitric oxide (NO), and superoxide anions can be produced in macrophages to kill microbes. However, an excessive generation of the free radicals under pathological conditions is associated with a wide range of illnesses. Plants are known to be rich in antioxidant phytochemicals. Chiang and colleagues evaluated the free radical scaveng- ing activity of crude extract, fractions, and compounds of B. pilosa using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase assays [70]. Using DPPH and hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase assays, they found that the B. pilosa crude extract and the ethyl acetate, butanol, and water fractions had free radical scavenging activity. Nine compounds, Heptyl- 2-O--xylofuranosyl-(1- 6)-- glucopyranoside (199), 3-O-Rabinobioside (124), Quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (130), Chlorogenic acid (167), 3,4-Di-O- caffeoylquinic acid (169), 3,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (170), 4,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (171), Jacein (119), and Cen- taurein (110) had DPPH radical scavenging activity [70]. The IC 50 values of the B. pilosa crude extract/fractions and compounds are summarized in Tables 14 and 15, respectively. Measurement of free radical scavenging activities is one way of assessing the antioxidant activities of B. pilosa and its fractions and compounds. It is interesting that the ethyl acetate and butanol fractions are more active than the water fraction and B. pilosa crude extract [70]. Of the secondary metabolites, only phenolic compounds 124, 130, 167, 169, and 171 showed significant DPPH-radical scavenging activities. Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 43 Further analysis of the structure-activity relationship of the compounds suggested that substitution of the C3 hydroxyl group with glycosides increased the activity approximately 2-fold (for example, in compounds 124 and 130) relative to quercetin (-OH in its C3) [70]. Further modification of the structures of the active compounds needs to be performed to test the effects of various substituents on activity. The reason why most of the antioxidant compounds contain phenol moieties in their structure could be that the reduction- oxidation (redox) properties of phenols allow them to act as reducing agents, singlet oxygen quenchers, and hydrogen donors. A complementary study by Muchuweti and colleagues determined phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and the phenolic profile of B. pilosa methanol extract [89]. They estimated that the phenolic content of the methanol extract of B. pilosawas 1102.8+-2.2mg/g [89]. Vanillin, hydroxyben- zaldehyde, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, and ferulic acid were found in this extract.The B. pilosa extract also showed DPPH radical scavenging activity. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of the flavonoids found in B. pilosa was correlated with its hepatoprotective effects through their inhibition of NF-B activation which may lessen the oxidative stress caused by the production of free radicals during liver injury [60].This activity might also be due to the anti-inflammatory effects of the aqueous extracts of B. pilosa aerial parts on the inhibition of COX-2 and PGE 2 production [88]. Essential oils from B. pilosa flowers and leaves are also reported to possess antioxidant activity. With the aim of replacing chemically synthesized additives, Deba and col- leagues [92] worked on the antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activities of essential oils and water extracts of B. pilosa's leaves and flowers. Table 16 summarizes the results obtained from DPPH free radical scavenging assay. It can be inferred fromTable 16 that essential oils from the leaves possessed the highest activity. It is reported elsewhere that monoterpenes present in essential oils such that of B. pilosa have protective effects and antioxidant properties [92]. Beta-carotene bleaching method was also performed. Leaves essential oils and aqueous extracts of the leaves and flowers showed higher activity than the flower essential oils. This is due to the volatility of the flower essential oils. The activity exhibited by the aqueous extracts was accounted to the presence of phenolic compounds that are reported to donate a hydrogen atom to free radicals such that the propagation of the chain reaction during lipid oxidation is terminated [92]. Overall, essential oils and phenolics present in B. pilosa can be thought of as major antioxidant compounds. 3.5. Immunomodulatory Activity. B. pilosa is thought to be an immunomodulatory plant and is reported to be effective in the treatment of immune disorders such as allergy [75], arthritis [75], and T1D [48, 50, 53]. As pointed out in the discussion of its anti-diabetic activities (Section 3.3), a combination of phytochemicals method and T-cell activation assays was used to study immunomodulatory properties of B. pilosa. IFN- is a key cytokine released by T and NK cells that mediates immune cells and sustains immunity against pathogens. Defects in IFN- expression, regulation, and activation result in vulner- ability to diseases caused by bacteria and viruses [69]. An elegant study, performed byChang and colleagues using IFN-  promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct in Jurkat T cells, showed that hot water crude extracts of B. pilosa increased IFN- promoter activity two-fold [69]. Out of the subfractions of this extract, the butanol fraction, but not the water or ethyl acetate, fractions, increased IFN- promoter activity six-fold. Centaurein (110) and centaureidin (109) were identified from the butanol fraction and were stated to cause a four-fold increase in IFN- promoter activity with EC 50 values of 75 g/mL and 0.9g/mL, respectively. The mechanism of action of centaurein was determined using transcription factors such as AP-1, NFAT, and NFB which are reported to bind to IFN- promoter and regulate IFN- transcription. Unlike with the activity of the positive control, PHA, centaurein caused a four-fold increase in NFAT, a 3-fold increase in NFB and had little, if any, effect on AP-1 enhancer activities (23-fold, three-fold, and ten-fold increases, respectively, were seenwith PHA) [69].The authors concluded that centaureinmodulates IFN- expression by the NFAT and NFB pathways. The article only determined the mechanism of action of centaurein. Its aglycone centaureidin may act through the samemechanism though this conclusion needs to be further verified. B. pilosa extract and its compounds are reported to inhibit differentiation of na"ive CD4+ helper T (Th0) cells into Th1 cells [49]. Using theThcell differentiation assay as a screening platform, 3 polyynes, 2--D-glucopyranosyloxy-1 - hydroxytrideca-5,7,9,11-tetrayne (53), 3--D-glucopyranosyl- 1-hydroxy-6(E)- tetradecene-8,10,12-triyne (69), and 2--D- glucopyranosyloxy-1-hydroxy-5(E)- tridecene-7,9,11-triyne (49) were discovered from B. pilosa [49, 53]. The data shows that cytopiloyne and other two polyynes suppressed the differentiation of type 1 helper T (Th1) cells and production of Th1 cytokines and promoted that of type 2 helper T (Th2) cells and production of Th2 cytokines, thus explaining the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of B. pilosa and its polyynes. Chang and colleagues were the first to report the effect of the butanol extract of B. pilosa on the autoimmune diabetes and airway inflammation inmice [48]. Imbalance in the levels ofTh1 andTh2 and of various cytokines leads to autoimmune diseases. T1D and other autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, among others) are exacerbated by an increase Th1 levels (specifically, CD4+ Th1 cells) while Th2 cells antagonize this effect [19]. Moreover, Th2 cells mediate asthma in ovalbumin-induced hypersensitivity in BALB/c mice [48]. In their work [48], Chang and colleagues showed that 10mg/kg butanol extracts with 1.5% (w/w) compound 69 and 1.1% (w/w) compound 49 (Table 11) ameliorated the development of Th1-mediated diabetes in NOD mice through inhibition of  cell death and leukocyte infiltration. At the same dosage, the butanol extracts also exacerbated ovalbumin-induced pulmonary inflammation in BALB/c mice with an increase in the infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells into the airway of the mice [48]. Despite the different outcomes, both mouse models proved 44 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine the concept that control over the Th1/Th2 shift is associated with autoimmune diseases and that the B. pilosa butanol extract can shift the differentiation of Th0 cells to Th2 cells [48, 49]. An extended study presented by Chiang and colleagues showed that compound 53 modulates T-cell functions [50]. Using CD4+ T cells from BALB/c mice, they demonstrated that cytopiloyne decreased levels of IFN- producing cells (Th1) by 12.2% (from 72% to 59.8%). Since Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation is antagonistic, it was expected that compound 53 increased the percentage of mouse IL-4 producing cells (Th2) by 7.2% (from 23.7% to 30.9%). Subsequent assess- ment of effect of compound 53 on the modulation of the transcription of IL-4 and IFN- showed that cytopiloyne, as expected, decreased the splenocyte levels of IFN- mRNA and increasing that of IL-4 in a dose-dependent manner. In the range of 0.1 to 3 g/mL of compound 53, the effects were not attributed to its cytotoxicity. Consequently, using 3g/mL cytopiloyne for 72 and 96 hours, the protein concentration of IFN- decreased to 18.6% and 44.4%, respectively. Under the same conditions, cytopiloyne increased IL-4 concentrations to 198.5% and 247.0% (for 72 and 96 hours, resp.). This modulation of T-cell differentiation exhibited by compound 53 was used to explain its anti-diabetic activity [50]. The anti-diabetic role of cytopiloyne was extensively discussed above (Section 3.3, anti-diabetic activity). The molecular basis of the regulation of cytokine expression by cytopiloyne has been described. Cytopiloyne directly elevated the expression level of IL-4 via GATA-3 upregulation in T cells [53]. However, reduction of IFN- expression in T cells seemed to come from the indirect opposing effect IL-4 cytokine because the expression level of T-bet was unaltered [53]. In this way, cytopiloyne skewedTh1 polarization into the Th2 state, conferring protection against T1D in NOD mice. Aside frompolarization ofThcell differentiation, cytopiloyne also activated the expression of Fas ligand in pancreatic b cells, this increase leading to the partial depletion of T cells and reduction of immune response in local areas such as the pancreas. Of note, cytopiloyne also inhibited T-cell proliferation and activation. By targeting T cells from three immunomodulatory actions, cytopiloyne protects against T1D and probably other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases [19]. The phytochemical constituents of B. pilosa exert their functions on different immune cells to modulate immune response. It is possible that some of the compounds may have agonistic or antagonistic effects on immune response. Immune function of B. pilosa may depend on its compo- sition and amount of compounds, which could explain the apparently conflicting report of B. pilosa butanol extract aggravating allergy in mice [48] while cellulosine-treated extract ameliorated allergy [48, 75]. IFN- promoter reporter assays and T-cell differentiation assays were used to isolate 2 flavonoids [69] and 3 polyynes [49, 50] as immunomod- ulatory compounds from the butanol fraction of B. pilosa. Interestingly, the flavonoids promote IFN- expression in NK and T cells. In marked contrast, the polyynes promote IL-4 expression and indirectly inhibit IFN- expression in differentiating T cells. Sensitivity appears to be the key to identifying structure- and bioactivity-related phytochemicals from medicinal plants. 3.6. Antimalarial Activity. The use of chemical drugs against pathogens has resulted in drug-resistant mutants. Examples of drug resistance can be found in the species of the Plasmodium that cause malaria. It is important to search for new compounds to combat Plasmodium parasites [47].
