180 ùúág/mL could cause 50% death of Th1 cells. Moreover,
this study suggested that the butanol fraction may prevent
diabetes in NOD mice in vivo via downregulation of Th1
cells or upregulation Th2 cells that have effects which are
antagonistic of those of Th1 cells [49]. This was proven by
intraperitoneal injection of the butanol fraction at a dose
of 3mg/kg BW, 3 times a week, to NOD mice from 4 to 27
weeks. This dosage resulted in lower incidence of diabetes
(33%). At a dose of 10mg/kg, the butanol fraction of B.
pilosa totally eliminated (0%) the initiation of the disease. To further support this result, assessment of IgG2a and IgE
production was performed in the serum of NOD mice. As
in vivo results obtained from intracellular cytokine staining,
experiments were not very conclusive levels of IgG2a and IgE
were measured since Th1 cytokine IFNùõæ; and Th2 cytokine
IL-4 favor the production of IgG2a and IgE, respectively. As
expected, high levels of IgE and some decline in the levels of
IgG2a were observed in the serum. Profiling of the butanol
extract revealed five compounds, 3-ùõΩ-D-Glucopyranosyl-
1-hydroxy-6(E)-tetradecene-8,10,12-triyne (69), 2-ùõΩ-D-

(50), 4,5-Di-O-caffeoyl- quinic acid, 3,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic
acid, and 3,4-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid. Only the first two
compounds showed similar effects on the prevention of
diabetes in NOD mice as the B. pilosa butanol fraction. Moreover, compound 50 showed greater activity than
compound 69 in terms of enhancement (by 34% compared
to 8%) of differentiation of Th0 to Th2 at 15 ùúág/mL (both

compounds) and inhibition (by 40% compared to 10%) of
differentiation toTh1 at the same concentration [49]. Among the three polyynes found in B. pilosa, cytopiloyne
(53) had the most potent anti-T1D activity [53]. To test the in
vivo effect of cytopiloyne, NODmice received intraperitoneal
or intramuscular injection of cytopiloyne at 25ùúág/kg BW,
3 times per week. Twelve-week-old NOD mice started to
develop T1D, and 70% of NOD mice aged 23 weeks and
over developed T1D. Remarkably, 12- to 30-week-old NOD
mice treated with cytopiloyne showed normal levels of blood
glucose (<200mg/dL) and insulin (1-2 ng/mL). Consistent

with T1D incidence, cytopiloyne delayed and reduced the
invasion of CD4+ T cells into the pancreatic islets [53]. In vitro study showed that cytopiloyne (53) inhibited the
differentiation of na¬®ƒ±veTh (Th0) cells (i.e., CD4+ T cells) into
Th1 cells and promoted differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2
cells [50]. The in vitro data are consistent with the in vivo
results indicating that cytopiloyne reducedTh1differentiation
and increased Th2 differentiation as shown by intracellular
cytokine staining and FACS analysis [53]. In line with the
skewing of Th differentiation, the level of serum IFN-ùõæ and
IgG2c decreased while that of serum IL-4 and serum IgE
increased compared to the negative controls (PBS-treated
mice). Cytopiloyne also enhanced the expression of GATA-
3, a master gene for Th2 cell differentiation, but not the
expression of T-bet, a master gene forTh1 cell differentiation,
further supporting its role in skewingTh differentiation [53]. Also importantly, cytopiloyne partially depleted CD4+
rather than CD8+ T cells in NOD mice [53]. As shown in
Table 13, coculture assays showed that the depletion of CD4+
T cells was mediated through the induction of Fas ligand
expression on pancreatic islet cells by cytopiloyne, leading to
apoptosis of infiltrating CD4+ T cells in the pancreas via the
Fas and Fas ligand pathways. However, cytopiloyne did not
induce the expression of TNF-ùõº in pancreatic islet cells and,
thus, had no effect on CD8+ T cells [53]. In addition, Chang and colleagues showed that cytopi-
loyne dose-dependently inhibited T-cell proliferation stimu-
lated by IL-2 plus Con A or anti-CD3 antibody, using [3H]
thymidine incorporation assay [53]. Overall, the mechanism of action of cytopiloyne and,
probably, its derivatives in T1D includes inhibition of T-cell
proliferation, skewing of Th cell differentiation, and partial
depletion of Th cells. Due to the anti-diabetic mechanisms
